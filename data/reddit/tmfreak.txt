Really? Bought last Monday, received cancel order 5 days later, 18 minutes before fullfillment, 150 dollars per bitcoin later. Mountain out of molehills? Really?

This is an absolutely important point. People just keep failing to realize this. I'm not trying to jump into it but its why "fixing guantanamo" is impossible using US legal courts. Laws of one country being possibly "violated" on another's soil by people who aren't even of that country. The same with bitcoin. What if France decides to blacklist bitcoins from "racists"?
Can you black list US dollar bills? (Sorta yes and sorta no, but mostly no), how is this ANY different?

I know what you mean. I have no experience, but it would seem like non-US countries its a bit easier to get this done. I guess one really would just have to get off one's butt and go do local bitcoins or something. It definitely seems like the "getting bitcoins" as easy and fast as possible is just not there. I personally think this is a considerable issue for barrier for entry. 
It seems the only way anybody MIGHT be able to get bitcoins is to provide all your personal information to some company you don't know in another country, and wire money to them, wait many many days, then buy them on an exchange. Lame. (Or doing local bitcoins, if they're even local to you... they're not to me).

Hence why I said transparency. The sheer number of reddits of "Coinbase canceled due to high risk" indicates two things in my mind. A. obviously that their algorithm out of control flags accounts, but more importantly that B. there isn't nearly the kind of front facing of this algorithm approach to somebody who just joins.
What I should have done, was submit a help desk ticket the moment I got an account and say "whitelist my account". That's just a ridiculous situation though, but apparently that is what is necessary to do business with coinbase (for many people). I have to give them my personal information to include copies of documents that could be used for identity theft (for regulatory compliance) and that's still not enough for them. What else did I need to do fill in one of those autogen letter/number combinations to make sure they know i'm not a bot? Come on, is anybody else questioning this need for this auto flagging algorithm, especially since the ONLY thing apparently to bi-pass this security feature is a reply email going "white list me"? I guess the fraudsters never thought of that...
 You're saying they're providing a service to legacy currency systems, I'll accept that, but what I'm not accepting that that somehow negates their own "algorithm" to stop fraud. Nobody else has it, just them (That I know of). There are three ways to find out about this "High Risk" cancellation. 
A. Get an account and place an order, and get the email 5 days later, after Bitcoin has gone up by 100 dollars (by that day its now up around 200+ dollars) and be completely pissed off about it
B. Proactively read their FAQ before you do ANYTHING on their site and come across a tucked in FAQ on high risk and think "Hey this probably happens to many people" or 
C. read about it on reddit.

I'm sitting in a similar situation, but double the price. But I just got an email (10 days later) saying they would reverse it. I asked them to do it before, they ignored that statement and just whitelisted it, so i pushed back again, and they said "Oh sure we can do that". 
So once I get my coin, I'll be back to neutral with them.

You some what acknowledged the argument regarding a "Dictatorship" in your first reply then go back and ignore it in your second. 


Legitimate by whom? Who gets to decide that? What about bitcoins related to marijuana cases? Legal in one US state, not in another. Effectively this would create a situation where they are the masters of the currency. (He who controls the money controls the people right?)
This is the same problem again and again. Remove freedom's for securities. Producing a better currency / infrastructure and a more aware community should be the only thing they should be focusing on.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:50:24
Yeah forget them. I tried weeks ago same deal. Bitstamp seems good to go. Got a verification within like 2 days.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:19:31
WHat I'm also really curious about is whether Chinese are buying Bitcoin in USD...
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:40:25
That's a good analogue and more importantly that people don't necessarily go ahead and buy it but actually wait for the next one (and eventually have to buy a new one because its a piece of shit and falls apart).
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:12:14
Still dont' have a Gox account. Signed up for one 2 weeks ago. Still waiting. Sent them an email nothing. So I signed up for another, so let me sit out of the market for at least another 4 days...
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:03:09
I don't think they'll drop USD for bitcoin exclusively or anything like that, but I do think there will DEFINITELY be hot money dollars flowing into bitcoin from them. Anything and everything purchasable by USD.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:40:15
I'll calm down when I get the bitcoin I ordered on Monday at the prices I paid. I was actually looking at wheeling and dealing, but we'll see how that goes. There will be a correction, the question is whether or not I'll make any money before then.
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:00:00
I was just simply pointing it out that they're not hiding it and its the way their business is already viewed / marketed.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:05:35
This actually kind of concerns me. Mostly this would point to (in my mind) the hot money flows from China finally finding a home, meaning bitcoin will probably shoot to the moon (hmm maybe why it is right now).
A lot of people seem to like that, but I'm not one of them. Sort of like when all those USD make their way back home to create the inflation that is definitely likely to happen. (See the US housing bubble 2.0 since its all in cash).
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:44:29
Agreed. I got the same email this morning. I was quite pissed off, and immediately snidely replied (shouldn't have).
So i collected myself a few minutes ago and put in a customer service email.
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:32:58
Still no response for me and its been since Friday. So we'll see.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:01:32
Watching fiatleak says the US is buying more bitcoin than china. USA!! USA!! USA!! (Just had to say it)
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:23:33
Not even joking I read this too fast and read "6 Dollar Tree's" will accept bitcoin.
I was like HOLY SHIT, this thing is getting big if dollar tree is taking bitcoin... "yes I'll do bitcoin cash back please".
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:51:51
I have been thinking about this for the last 2 weeks in relation to bitcoin going up and the Coinbase thing. Effectively something along the lines of "you're not remembered for when things are normal and everything is calm, but when things get hot and shit hits the fan". It's like we don't think of the "hero" when he (or she) is drinking a cup a coffee and just doing their normal job, they become a hero when they pull somebody from a burning car. Or they become a turd when they refuse (or unable I suppose) to pull a person from a burning car. 
I think this probably applies MORE to Mt Gox than Coinbase that's for sure.
edit: I should further clarify that I would still be willing to do business with them, if a similar honoring my purchase yada yada yada, but this wouldn't slip my mind next time I make a purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:34:54


You didn't tell me what the crime was, if its a crime that I felt should be a crime, why on earth would I be doing business and commerce with said person? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:51:28
Some might say that your last slight is a positive. In fact on bitcoin.org they're called a Paypal like service. So... to some that's good, apparently you're not too thrilled with Paypal.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:35:55
Well like I said, i'm not going to now jump on the "coinbase is awesome" bandwagon. I still personally disagree with their "algorithm" approach, and their excruciatingly slow customer service. I can appreciate their difficulties, not to mention the fact they're just about the only US company out there.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:37:57
You're describing the viewpoint of a speculator and not a user. Not saying that you're not the only person that holds this view, I personally think this is one reason why its wayyyyyy in bubble territory right now.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:17:44
Agreed. I was given a response and it wasn't a price honoring. I sent a reply so we'll see.
Like I've said in other posts they're style of business doesn't make any sense. They've set themselves in a situation where they drive off new customers and piss people off who may even be customers to probably ease their regulatory burden / cost of doing financial business (that's my assessment via their "algorithm"). In the end you have customers and canceled orders waiting days upon days requiring customer support (of which they have zero in my opinion) go through probably a mountain of back log.
Doesn't sound like a company designed looking to be serious at gaining customers. My biggest problem is the lack of transparency about this issue to people signing up with them. It should be pretty obvious to somebody who is new to coinbase.
Edit: Granted I'll say that I'm certainly a little bent and biased on this topic because I haven't seen satisfactory conclusions, and perhaps if I was in 8rightnow's scenario, I might care a little less and be more optimistic.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:02:36
To be honest playing with people's money, and acting as though its OK that they have issues, is beyond retarded. If they can't handle individual customers like a customer should be, they shouldn't be in business. If they can't handle the customers they have, they should limit their operations to what they can support. 
You really think any of these people who have outstanding issues with MtGox should be thankful? Seriously? The next time you think you've been wrongfully fucked by somebody or a company make sure to appreciate what they've done for other people.
Just because you've felt like you've been done right by them, casting aside other people's problems and going "ahh look what good they've done for other people" is hardly an appropriate response.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:54:29
If putting your personal information in, and submitting documentation and hooking up to your personal bank account doesn't prevent fraud, then what the heck are they doing to prevent it? I'm completely impatient about this nonsense to be frank. 
What more steps did I personally need to do to prevent this kind of nonsense. They should have some sort of next step required to not get flagged by their "algorithm". If they were an open company, don't you think they'd have plastered on their website that you could be flagged as "high risk" and your transacation may not go through? I'm pretty sure if they did that, less people would be wasting their time. Right now, 100% they're wasting my time, and at this point, I do not trust their company (not necessarily integrity, but quality, and business practices).
To be honest if that's the quality of their "algorithm" I'll do my business elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:34:04
So I thought it was a currency?
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:29:59
I dunno I've heard/seen quite a few good reviews (or at least reversals) of coinbase. 
To be honest if you'd consider yourself a newbie, and even with Coinbase, taking a side and coming out with an affirmation that whats going on isn't "crooked" or just that what other people who have clearly much more money in the game is "shit happens", isn't probably a good position to take, rather one of neutrality.

Give it a day. Mine said yesterday, its in there today.
