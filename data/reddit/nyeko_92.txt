Do something! Just make Bitcoin bigger and better, now! Stop arguing and just do something. These nimrod conglomerations companies are going to innovate and leave Bitcoin in the dust, and we'll all be bag holders.

Charlie lee(I assume he is a Core Developer and he has a good connection with the miners in china aka his brother bobby lee of BTCC) could be a rep to connect Chinese and Western bitcoin communites together. Another proposition is to have streaming events where the exchanges(Coinbase,Bitstamp etc.) sit and discuss with the the big miners(BTCC,KNCminer,Antpool etc.) to solve this blocksize issue(online or at a event).

@_date: 2016-03-29 15:08:14
trezor,digital bitbox(co-created by jonas a bitcoin core developer) = high end
Ledger nano = cheaper yet just as good as trezor.

@_date: 2016-03-28 22:28:12
bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-03-24 20:05:48
it will be probably be out by may(thats when most of the wallets will adopt it in addition to bitpay).the question though is it possible for exchanges/payment processors to utilize segwit, when transacting bitcoins to customers?
@_date: 2016-03-12 00:11:27
He will hopefully change.
(Hope the three letter guys arent looking me up and CIA planning something right now) :)
@_date: 2016-03-30 22:16:12
will it contain segwit? 
@_date: 2016-03-20 19:24:33
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:27:13
Any possibility that exchanges could start working on compatibilty with segwit(BTCC,Coinbase,Electrum(Wallet),Safello,Gemini,Airbitz(wallet) etc)? 
Also somebody should make a website with a list of the companies/wallets/exchanges/miners support/working on compatibility with Segwit
@_date: 2016-03-11 23:54:04
Core will win(Bitcoin exchange Gemini is supporting them

No EMV card, No International option for this debit card.

@_date: 2016-03-22 18:07:25
lightning will supplement the transaction speed.

@_date: 2016-01-12 18:57:29
so basically the ONLY safe way of storing your coins IS a hardware wallet like ledger,keepkey and trezor?

I know the price has gone down now recently, but to be honest i believe by a few months after the halvening(with hopefully this stupid blocksize issue being settled) the price will go up dramatically.

@_date: 2016-01-13 15:17:35
they are either appointing him to eventually implementing Bitcoin as a part of a payment method for paypal or buying XAPO in the upcoming future in order to get into the bitcoin debit card business/bitcoin wallet &amp; high quality secure wallets competing with Coinbases "Shift" card.

Web wallets(Coinbase,Xapo,Circle,blockchain.info) is the worse place to store your bitcoins. Store it at a desktop/mobile wallet like bitcoin core,breadwallet,electreum,copay or (the best way) a hardware wallet like Ledger/trezor.

@_date: 2016-06-12 23:28:22
Eurozone is where the main currency that is used(Controlled by the centralbank =ECB(located in Germany)) = Euro(€). Sweden,Denmark,UK,czech republic and most of the eastern european countries do not use Euro(€), they use their own currencies and they have their own centralbanks(in Sweden = riksbanken,In the UK = Bank of England etc.)

@_date: 2016-02-08 18:31:51
hi Erik, big fan of Shapshift and coincap.io(wish you could add a widget to the app for iOS to show the prices of the cryptocurrencies).
Regarding the statement i made above,Casares is a part of paypal board of directors : 
Do you think paypal will eventually integrate bitcoin into their wallet using Casares expertise and maybe using XAPO as a intermediate?
@_date: 2016-02-21 12:12:04
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:30:08
she is cute.
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:49:11
Personally, I think Jihan should open-source(open-source patent) the ASICboost technology just like Elon did it for tesla.
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:28:13
they have XAPO CEO as board of directors so...
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:14:19

@_date: 2016-02-14 17:48:25
to add on to your comment(Im not promote altcoins), i agree with you and people that are complaining on the blocksize should checkout Litecoin,Dogecoin which could be used to buy coffee or tea at starbucks/tim hortons.
@_date: 2016-02-08 00:42:54
they have the CEO of Xapo as Board of directors.
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:01:44

@_date: 2016-02-02 22:40:11

@_date: 2016-02-28 20:01:39

@_date: 2016-02-04 00:26:32
Ask him what his opinion is on the Bitcoin price this year,blocksize-issue(Core vs Classic), Regulation(especially whats happening in EU) and if openbazaar will have its full release this year?

@_date: 2016-02-04 19:42:52

@_date: 2016-02-29 13:30:46
or by just knowing the loopholes of the system(In the Nordic countries and Canada) and taking advantage of them to the max, while still getting the benefits (health care etc.) that the countries offer.
@_date: 2017-04-22 02:19:59

What better options(besides Cash) would be useful to have when deflation occurs?
@_date: 2016-02-02 20:16:42
@_date: 2016-02-02 19:14:35
deflation - less money printed = money worth more and goods worth less. 
devaluation is when you lower the value of the currency to hedge(stop) deflation.

@_date: 2016-02-15 02:32:21


Wasn't seg wit supposed to be done and released around april? 
I agree with you to a certain degree, however after SF has been released if it gets released in time with not alot of delays, a immediate plan for 2MB HF or a (SF if is possible) should be put into a roadmap so that exchanges and especially the miners know that things are progressing instead of stalling everything(which has been the problem since august last year partially due to the cancer "mike hearn"). 
@_date: 2016-02-08 20:56:38

they are already using Point No.1, They have used No.2(and might still use it in the future), Point No.4 is being used currently and Point No.3 will prolly come to full effect in the upcoming future(Thinking of EU or USA since china is more or less accepting BTC)

how? through a bitcoin atm/localbitcoins? are they any bitcoin ATMs in Iceland?
@_date: 2015-11-30 12:20:37
I would say if Germany,Greece, One of the countries in Southern Europe went strongly to bitcoin(Europe have a Huge crisis atm with migrants, countries being bankrupt etc.) then that would be huge.
Note also Barbados is kind of considered a tax haven, so if a country lets say US or a big country like russia decides to ban alternatively tax bitcoin, people will be moving their bitcoins to barbados.

I would recommend you to get a HW wallet to store your coins so that they don´t get stolen(i would recommend you the Ledger Nano or Trezor).

tbh im not from kenya(im born in sweden) but my parents are from kenya, Kenya has a banking crisis atm, where the Central goverment has bailout two big banks(Chase bank kenya) and (Dubai bank) after they went bankrupt. 
In this case Bitcoin(through Bitpesa) would be great help especially when the majority of kenyan population buy stuff through their smartphones.

@_date: 2017-05-16 20:48:37

@_date: 2016-05-23 12:58:42
I would say only KnC, Slushpool(are more open to changes).
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:51:43
I agree (Not stating that i want it to happen), and i think a financial crisis(Credit Crunch) will trigger it(end of this year or in beginning of 2018).

@_date: 2015-10-16 19:26:39

thank you for the answer charlie, I thought that he was for block size(which I agree with) although im worried that he is leaning towards the switch to bitcoin XT(which i dont agree with). Anyways hopefully by december as you said this block size issue will be solved 
@_date: 2016-05-30 14:29:35
haha dude is salty because he had chosen the wrong place to start his mining company(Sweden = Great climate for mining businesses but high taxes for the electricity). 
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:31:00
nope they didnt(didnt take account to the cost of electricity with tax etc.).
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:41:07

@_date: 2015-10-14 21:46:12
how the f**k does he know this? does he have some insider info, if so does he think that XT take over Core or will Core stay king? 
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:06:00
i would say this year might be the last chance to get bitcoins when its in its below 500, next year might be the year it 1btc might be worth something in four digit value!
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:30:47
I would short the crap out of it. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:01:08

@_date: 2015-10-16 14:13:48
the question is does he support XT or Core? 
@_date: 2016-07-04 00:22:53
@_date: 2016-07-25 18:23:28
or they will go to PM(Gold,Silver,Platinum).
@_date: 2016-07-10 16:43:58
i would say the whole world.
@_date: 2015-10-19 20:29:33
hopefully the will accept it as a "asset" at worse case.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:17:48
Gemini is the perfect exchange (if you live in the UK,US,Canada,Japan,Singapore,Hongkong or South Korea).
