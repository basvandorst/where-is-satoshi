You can adjust the fees but the standard should be fine. I think it was ~0.8%

The prices for mining hardware on ebay are insanely high atm. Or keep them for the museum ��

I think schildbach wallet was available around 2011. But yeah OP says he used core. But core names there wallet "wallet.dat" right and the schildbach wallet backup of my friend was named bitcoin-wallet-backup-yyyy-mm-dd. Plus you cant use that backup with any other software without the steps described in the bitcointalk post. Could be worth a try ☺️
Edit: or just try and restore it with that app ��

@_date: 2017-08-11 20:36:58
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:44:08
Sorry stupid from me mabey just try and restore it with that app. Even without password it should display the balance. I had to go through the process of the bitcointalk post to claim BCH for my friend. (To access the private keys direct)
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:06:05
Someone with similar problems and got it working?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:44:21
haha jeah.. plus i could swear 2 hours ago that block had CTRL + C on it  (;
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:10:00
Iframe dat shit 
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:55:03
also this could help if you have no android phone around and just want to transfer the money to another adress
edit :  heres a screenshot of his old wallet left side is encrypted right side unencrypted as explained on github.
and then
 
"You can then put the recovery seed into an offline copy of: 
Put the seed into the "BIP39 Mnemonic" section at the top. Then click "BIP32" under Derivation Path, set "Client" to "Custom Derivation Path" and set the "BIP32 Derivation Path" to: m/0'/0"
"NOTE: You may need to click "show more" to see all your addresses if you have used more than 20 receive addresses... and you'll also need to set the "BIP32 Derivation Path" to: m/0'/1 to get access to your change addresses!"

2 years new..
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:38:22
Would be nice! but i think in reality three years from now btc beginners don't now what segwit is or that it was not there from the beginning of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:39:16
Possible that this is from the Mobile schildbach wallet? I had success helping a friend with these steps 
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:28:33

Storing "Paperwallets" as PDF on a old sd card, usb stick,..

other nodes can then connect to your node and benefit from it. without opening it you only have 8 connections. with ports open 100+.
you can check if ports are opened here :

wtf 5 years in crypto is a veeeeeery long time
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:48:17
Correct, perhaps buying BT1 tokens at bitfinex would make more sense.
