I've been streaming the fastest chess you've ever seen, twice a week, for about a year. Although we have a couple Patreon supporters, no one (yet) has sent Bitcoin.
I put on an online chess tournament last weekend with 0.1 BTC as the prize! It had about 130 participants, and was a great way to get the word out for crypto.
