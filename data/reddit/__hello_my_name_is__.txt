The surprising part is that Bitcoin's value keeps rising nonetheless.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:27:29
I don't care whose fault it is. I'm just saying that any currency that can be manipulated this easily is pretty much worthless as a currency. Because, well, currencies have to be stable if you want to use them for actual day-to-day payments.
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:49:03
Any idea when that will be? Genuinely curious here.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:08:15
Yes, that's manipulation, by definition.
And before you say "why is that bad?": It's bad because it's a god damned currency (or it's supposed to be, anyways), and if any millionaire can just flat out decide the price of the currency he owns.. yeah, that's bad. Why do I have to even explain that?

Day to day shifts start to matter when the Euro suddenly goes down 10% in one day.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:05:43
..and yet the price of the Euro affects the prince of American goods that are paid in Dollars.
Imagine that.

It takes a few days to weeks to reach the consumer, but it will definitely have an influence on various goods. Not sure why I need to explain basic global economics in r/bitcoin of all places, but here I go.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:17:05
Sure, that's a perfectly fine argument. But at the same time also very much an argument for why no one should use Bitcoin as an actual currency. Because, y'know, people have to pay for stuff. Even in the week in which the currency is being manipulated.

Sure, rollercoasters are way more fun than gentle rides. And if I want to throw some money away for fun, I indeed will go with the rollercoaster.
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:43:19
Sure, and it's perfectly fine if you enjoy doing that.
But, y'know. The whole "Bitcoin is a currency" thing becomes a bit of a huge joke in that case.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:25:38


And meanwhile the price swings around wildly by 10% and more.
Again, why do I have to explain how bad that is for something that's supposedly to be used as a currency?
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:50:24
...and that's why currencies are heavily regulated.
I mean, you know you're making an argument for *more* regulation here, not less, right?
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:26:38
What, you think there won't be any ripple effects just because the ripple effects are delayed by a few days or weeks? You think the second sudden rapid change is somehow going to *overtake* the first one and cancel it out before it reaches you?
That's.. that's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:52:39
I mean, sure, if you just want to treat Bitcoin as some money making machine, that's fair enough. But why do people hail it as the solution to decentralized currencies when it's clearly not that?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:01:31
And I'm just stating the fact that *without* regulation, there would be infinitely more market manipulation.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:59:59


That's.. that's not how that works, no. Currencies don't exist in a vacuum.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:59:58
Your argument is all fine and dandy, but just look at the goddamned 4 day graph of bitcoin right now. It's not a curve, it's a damn flat line that changes height twice.
Yeah, I'm calling manipulation.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:26:24
And that's why currencies are heavily regulated.
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:34:04
Hey, there's nothing wrong with making money with bitcoin. That's perfectly fine.
It's just completely useless as an actual currency, is all.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:32:45
And apparently people in this sub support that notion, I guess?
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:34:06
It's hilarious that some people here think this is a good thing.
Yeah, sure, currencies that can be easily manipulated to go $500 up/down are good! Perfectly stable! Nothing fishy going on here at all, guys!
