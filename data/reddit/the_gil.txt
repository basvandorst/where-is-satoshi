Actually, there IS evidence that they are closing all accounts. As I mentionned in r/bitcoinmtl,  I have been in touch with BMO's VP for product development. He told me when I inquired about their position on bitcoin businesses (I was planning on opening up my own) that they would open no account for bitcoin-related business and would be closing an such existing account.

I had a talk recently with my former boss @ Brazzers. They implemented Bitcoin on their [biggest amateur site]( (NSFW obviously). He told me they had a spike at the beginning a few months ago but died off very quickly and barely makes any sales anymore. At most 2 sales per day, very rarely; more often than not, 0 sales per day.
The porn industry will like Bitcoin when it brings in money and not before.

Cost depends on the issuer, just like server TLS certificates. Ours range from $90 to $250, depending on the chosen identity validation &amp; issuance process

Or why not simply use the actual already existing SI prefixes ?
10 ฿
10 m฿ = 0.01฿
10 µ฿ = 0.01 m฿ = 0.00001 ฿

From Canada:
I think this is the article from the Bank Act that they're using:
[See Article 3.a](
Banks are obligated to provide basic banking services to all, provided these criteria are met. If we can demonstrate that "banning all acounts matching a search for keyword *bitcoin*" is not *reasonable grounds*, we have something

Just remember, if your ISP package has a bandwidth cap (like in US or Canada), to edit your settings and cap the number of connection. My ISP was nice enough to tell me after a week I had used up half my package... went on to check the details and I was uploading ~30GiB per day...
I now have maxconnections=5

I guess that's the only valid reason for putting the symbol at the beginning, but it doesn't prevent french locales (Québec and France) to put the symbol at the end and find other ways of preventing numbers from being added. Like a trait which everyone already uses on checks
