I know I am not the anyone else your looking for.  However I would like to elaborate as my experience with coinbase, circle , snapcard and a few others that I can not remember off the top of my head that accept USD required so many hoops to jump through for one.  Once I completed these steps they still seemed to want more.  Coinbase in particular completely nixed me from their system for mistakes on their end.  I assume its due to the liability, that they are so on edge.  The interface they use is user friendly with a 2 factor Authentication (google authenticator) Not only do you have the ability to buy and sell bitcoin but litecoin and dogecoin as well.  I have received personal calls from them on a few occasions just to make sure it was me making the purchase, and the person that called was the same each time and very easy to talk to.  Maybe because they are not this huge exchange.  I am surprised no one really seems to know about them.  Also you can sell up to $50,000 of BTC weekly and buy $2500 weekly which I think was higher but thats still a lot.  The verification process is minimal and very non intrusive.  You can link it straight to your bank account (Bank of America, Chase ,Wells Fargo ,Citi, US Bank , USAA ,Capital One 360 ,Charles Schwab ,Fidelity ,PNC ,TD Bank ,Navy Federal Credit Union, SunTrust &amp; + More) as of now no credit cards.  Also once you make your purchase it takes about 7 days to clear.  I have purchased a good amount and not once have I had any issues and feel like I can call them directly and not get treated like a number in the system.

You don't want legal,  you would much more prefer lawful.

Sidechains will clear the image of whats to come as far as what blockchain tech and the world of internet squared 2.0 etc truly is becoming.  Allowing all cryptos to layer seamlessly on top of one another. As if the concept went from one big network with the first step into the internet and now into many big layered interactive networks capable of exchange.

1.Buy piper wallet (or. Similar) .. 
2.print as many paper wallets public key as you wish.
3.Use another wallet app {bread wallet etc } to fill paper wallet public key (printed in step 2) with  with 1$ amount.
4. Pass out paper wallets.

He speaks to the half that benefits from controlling us, Obama and all the rest of politicals.  They serve the money makers and masters.  They only see the benefits behind the old world and its contracts of adhesion, which have been so rich and productive in programming mankind.  The internet has already swallowed small retail and shifted many forms of business, now with it taking on its new form it will be devouring the need for government as we knew it.  Unless hes just playing a big trick and they all want us to get bitcoin because they can secretly monitor it and control it subversively.   Either way great video.

If you understand markets and technology adoption and the idea of blockchain tech and how it operates.  Most likely as stated the tech behind bitcoin would become quantum.  Making the playing field level.i think all blockchain tech is ahead of its time and once we can quantum we will finally be able to cater to blockchain fully.

The concept of then being copied will and is coming in handy.  Bitcoin is the father of alt coins and it has spread its seed so that it may exist.  Amen

This technology allows for companies to finally regulate uncontested by the regulators and it is all because of the power of DLT.  It won’t matter if someone can be responsible for creating it.  When it is intended to function in a decentralized fashion the intention is king.  Just look at dogecoin.  A zombie with the coding of bitcoin ,  it can easily upgrade to mimic BTC and no one can stop that legally lawfully  and literally

I still think they just used his name as a cover.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:49:43
Yea I think Hal used that name but it was not just him involved.  The coincidence was not really harped on in the doc but that's the first thing I thought when they mentioned it.  However I still prefer Satoshi
To be the mascot .  He's just a regular meh kinda guy.  Perfect face for bitcoin

I'm waiting for a hardware wallet that is truly secure and can generate transactions from its app to be signed within hardware device and then sent back to app.  Would be epic game changer 
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:40:24
yea but you must connect it. I am speaking of a device like that but it has a small camera to scan QR generated code with transaction details that TREZOR can sign on device and then pop a new QR code from signed transaction that you cpu or mobile device can scan into app that goes with device.   You could also use just the app and scan any qr generated from any wallet like electrum etc that allow signing.

Great message bad meme

Can someone satoshi this or something 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:42:18


Wow thanks... She almost got it... I would run a base electrum protocol to sign all transactions and allow the camera to scan qr generated by app of transaction details.. Or Point of Sale Device (POS) at coffee shop.  Then that detailed tx hash would be read by hardware wallet and immediately sign and extract new qr for app or POS to scan.  
It would be fast and the only thing you would need to do is confirm the details of the tx on your hardware wallet.  Once confirmed on clear led screen, press ok and a QR pops up of signed tx hash (not sure if im using hash right (i just like the word).  
Now on mobile phone app or laptop app or point of sale device at coffee shop can scan qr from hardware wallet with its camera and broadcast the tx over the blockchain.
 The device would not have any sort of wifi or gsm of signal whatsoever.  Using open source electrum you could make a device that could hold much multi coin.  
It would be on you to back up keys etc.  However the hardware wallet could also import wallets from QR codes of private keys alone.  Or generate them.  The only thing thats missing is an onboard printer but that would really negate the devices ability to be compact and usable.  However you could sell a small thermal printer separately for full security.  Giving you the ability to print paper storage.  Printer would connect via usb and same usb could be used to access device on raspberry pi air gapped computer.  Where you can access device software running on TAILS USB OS where you can manage accounts and printing settings and hardware settings etc.
