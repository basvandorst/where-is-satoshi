Traded csgo keys for it.

I’m just extremely paranoid about getting hacked... that’s it.

Which one is better value for what you get with it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:14
How much?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:31:16
I know it may not seem like a lot to you but since I’ve been here since 7k I’ve profited around £80 in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:24:27
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:06:25
How much did you buy? Fractional amounts or whole bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:08:25
I’m not stupid enough to buy csgo cases anymore lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:54:21
It’s a lot! Shit... I only invested half of what you did.
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:25:05
Give your parents that 50 bucks and tell them to buy you some bitcoin from Coinbase?

He’s probably committed suicide by now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:58:26
Got in at 7k &amp; 11k. Little scared but fuck it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:09:15
Do whatever you want. No one can predict the price for Monday.

Value correlates with popularity and awareness.

I don’t think owning  2% of a Bitcoin is going to be worth holding on to. 50%, 100% maybe. But not 2%.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:35:00
Hm... I'm interested. How do I do this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:46:07
More like Roger **Ver** Scammer.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:52:47
