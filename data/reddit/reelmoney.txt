Does this mean there are Visa fees and Coinbase fees in the same transaction? If so, it seems like a step in the wrong direction imho.

This is a glaring example as to why money should be decentralized.
No one should ever have a monopoly on money.

Defeating banks is easier than using Bitcoin.
If people simply stop using banks, they would die off instantly. No need to wait for mass adoption of blockchain to accomplish such a feat.

It's a scam. Not even a good one at that.

What are you saying? You can simply withdraw all your funds after you get paid. If banks don’t have deposits, they cease to exist.

I think the crypto community has an uphill battle convincing “gold bugs” that cryptocurrency is a better form of money than gold.
They are inherently different and each have their pros and cons. Gold has intrinsic value and has a pretty good track record for being a store of value. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and is widely volatile which are not good characteristics when looking for a store of value.
When I wanted to get married in Europe, I needed to transfer $30k overseas. I had to pay a $45 wire transfer fee, I lost 7% of my money to fees on top of the FX exchange because banks are outright thieves, and to top it off... I had to wait 10 days just to access my finds again. Would this have been the case with Crypto? Obviously not!
This is just one of the many reasons why I believe blockchain will shape our future. But even with this in mind, do I think cryptocurrency is money? No. I do not. I believe blockchain is a powerful technology and cryptocurrency functions well as a currency, however, I cannot bring myself to believe it is a legitimate substitute for money (gold and silver). 
There are two main reasons for this train of thought. The first is reason is that digital infrastructures are fragile. There are many manmade and natural events that can effect data centers, power grids, and internet connectivity. Situations which occur that have these effects usually accompany circumstances in which money (and/or currency) play an important role in how well one fares during such times. This is why I think purely digital money of any kind is very dangerous for society. Second, blockchain and cryptocurrency interaction is highly technical. I’m sure that eventually the barrier to entry will be much lower and the ease of use will increase greatly, but relying on the masses to adopt a highly technical form of commerce is a pipe dream. We can’t even get people to stop throwing trash out of their car windows but yet some hope that everyone will be able to effectively manage private keys and not lose their life savings? I just don’t see it happening.

I think you meant Bitcoin will never become “Money”?
It’s already a currency. But currency and money are different. It doesn’t fix the money problem. But it’s already a better currency than Dollars, Euros, or -insert fiat paper dollar here-.

Best joke I've heard all day.

This makes a lot of sense. Gold miners use a similar strategy to lock in future production.  
But to say that this is the "major" driving force seems a little silly. It's like saying gold miners' shorts are the reason that gold is severely undervalued when it's very clear that institutional manipulation has hammered the price down since the 70's.

I hope one day I will be so burdened by shopping carts full of gold that it causes me to pull my hair out and beg the heavens for salvation.
