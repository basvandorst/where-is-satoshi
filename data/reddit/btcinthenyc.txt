Supposed to be $100,000 / BTC in 10~20 years no? I don't remember the threads but people say if Bitcoin gets even like 1% of the bonds/gold market then it would be $100,000 per bitcoin.

Nope, my employer is a Japanese company and I get paid in yen as a freelancer. I only make like $4,000 / month (give or take based on the exchange rate). Living in NYC is expensive so I don't have an awful lot of disposable income to put away into Roth IRA's, and the company does not match 401k's or whatnot. I save up around $8,0000 and bought 10 BTC and will just keep it and sell it when it goes to the moon.

My brotha

Thats me. I bought 15 BTC, sold 5, now I have 10 left. I'm not in such dire straights since BTC is above $1,000.

What is Buttcoin?

I telecommute work for a Japan-based employer and get paid in yen

I'm a guy that lives in NYC. Come find me.

In 25 years inflation wouldn't even matter because I would just be spending my Bitcoins.

Best answer

Isn't that what "To the Moon!" means? $100,000 / coin?
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:25:28
This guy knows what I'm talking about. 10 years, $100,000 / coin, I'll be a millionaire at 50 years old.

I never said the 10 BTC were my ONLY assets. I said I have 10 BTC put away towards my retirement. If it goes to the moon, I buy a yacht instead of a boat.

I'm saying, at THAT TIME then it would be appropriate to celebrate. Not 1 week before a big event that will likely erase many gains.

Do you read the news? Almost every news article is calling for ETF rejection. The BEST and I mean the most absolutely optimistic probability was like 50%.

WHERE YOU AT BRO?!??

So, if the Atlanta Falcons have a 50/50 chance of winning the Super Bowl, its alright to celebrate their victory before the game even starts?
I'm just saying that all this excitement seems a bit premature until we know the outcome of that decision. I think most people are in agreement that this recent price rise is due in large part to people speculating on the ETF. I don't believe this recent growth is organic. If the COIN ETF is accepted then that is great news. Not jsut for the price of BTC but for it taking steps for mainstream acceptance.

As someone new to it is rather concerning that anyone who says anything critical of Bitcoin is a buttcoiner or is just spreading FUD.


Bitcoin is Myspace before Facebook came along. Bitcoin is Altavista or Webcrawler before Google came along. Bitcoin is Netscape before Chrome came along. AOL before broadband internet.
Tech is full of examples of dominate early players being pushed into obscurity due to a better, more accessible alternative.
People who say Bitcoin is THE answer are full of themselves. Out of all the crytocurrencies, Bitcoin has got a massive lead. I hope it succeeds, but the bickering about Segwit vs. BU is hurting the community. Why are so many people so scared of things that might happen. 
You know, the Apollo Project had a bunch of what-ifs and if NASA was too scared to launch before addressing each one, we would've never made it to the moon.
1MB blocks, larger blocks. I don't fucking care what happens as long as I get faster and cheaper confirmations. Just one side concede to the other and then if shit hits the fan, you can say I told you so.

Every article on the ETF says the chances of approval are not good.
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:18:47
Yeah, now we can celebrate!

HOW YOU LIKE THEM APPLES
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:58:49
Yeah, look at the BTC price now....
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:06:44
It went from $900 to $1,100 overnight and it didn't look like it would stop anytime soon. I've been lurking this sub and everyone says it'll go to $10,000 or even $100,000 so HODL.
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:05:52
Thanks, that looks like the best plan.

Gemini just keeps repeating themselves "Go to transfers, deposit US, select ACH transfer".
I keep telling them that there is no option for ACH transfer. I only see wire transfer. Its the 3rd time we've done back and forth.

Wasn't there supposed to be another 0 at the end of that number? 4 months ago it was $100,000 by 2021
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:45:37
Simple example:
Before August 1st BTC is worth $3,000.
After August 1st, BTC and whatever fork is only worth $1,000.
1+1 = 2 total BTC (from both chains)
Sell 1 BTC before August 1st, buy 1.5 BTC of both forks after August 1st.
1.5 + 1.5 = 3 total BTC (from both chains)

All my coins are on my Ledger Nano S. Good luck hackers getting your hand on that. It is wrapped in plastic wrap, shoved up my ass. 
YOU WANT ME COINS, YOU GOTTA PULL THEM OUT OF MY ANUS.
