You obviously don't understand fractional reserve lending, And I'm too tired to teach.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:29:05
First, People have to stop treating Bitcoin with the same rules as fiat.
Bitcoin doesn't inflate or deflate like fiat, It expands or contracts with the people who use it, the more people who use it,the more it expands and the value goes up, The less people who use it, The more it contracts and the value goes down.
With ATM's opening up every day worldwide and new browser apps letting you purchase directly from sites like Amazon and Overstock, It's just a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks 10k, But only if people stop treating it like fiat.
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:05:26
Yes, Bitcoin is back to $400, but still undervalued by $99,999,599.99

@_date: 2014-07-21 08:03:14
That's because these regulators know exactly what the fuck mining is, They're oligarchs, Not retards, They said that crypto issuance requires licensing. Well how the fuck else is it supposed to get issued?, 100% pre-mine?, Just wait, You're about to see some shit come out of New York that will have massive implications for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-21 11:02:22
All fiat is out there is on loan and it all comes with interest, Every single dollar, The FED is a private institution that loans the U.S government dollars in exchange for certificates of debt known as bonds, Which get repaid in taxes, Inflation is inevitable due to applied interest since the money that the U.S. Government borrows from the FED comes with an interest payment too.
@_date: 2014-05-08 04:05:51
Negative, Fractional reserve lending doesn't work without applied interest which means people have to remain in debt, It is impossible to centralize Bitcoin when each individual is their own bank, So yes, *IT IS A SOLUTION TO ALL BANKING.*
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:08:00
It's lost it's value
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:36:52
Money is just a conventional medium for transferring goods or services and Bitcoin is no different, the problem lies in the stigma of fiat, Everyone I've talked to about Bitcoin asks the same question "How much money do you make?", (and by money they mean fiat), When I tell them that I don't use fiat or banks in any way they actually become interested.

Even though I've never traded on Gox before,I still considered their price to be the default price, Whenever I sold BTC I always referred Gox's price to my sell price because that what someone is paying for it, Now I just have to wait for everyone to move to another site and the price is already rebounding.

Mining isn't as profitable as it used to be if at all anymore, The only profitable way to mine is to just wait for a shit alt-coin to come out, Strip mine it until the difficulty gets high then hold on to it until it hits an exchange, then dump it for BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-20 10:26:41
No, They get it, They finally see Bitcoin as the threat to their monopoly that it actually is. So what do they do?, They outlaw it, It's just too bad that they'll get away with it too before there's anything anyone can say or do.

@_date: 2014-11-26 06:09:08
The only reason vendors convert BTC to fiat is to propagate their business interests. It's their wholesale suppliers who don't accept BTC in exchange for the goods they sell to vendors. Banks still won't accept BTC in exchange for loan debt because the fed doesn't even recognize it as a currency, It's counter-productive to their interests. The only way bitcoin works is if *EVERYONE* considers it currency. 
I can have a pile of rocks and call it money all day long, the only thing that really matters is that someone else calls it money.
As long as there are institutions in the great wheel of commerce that reject bitcoin, It will never be a complete currency.

If they keep charging interest on fractional reserve lending it's mathematically inevitable, The only saving grave fiat has is it's ability to multiply to compound it's own debt and the masses being told at birth that fiat is the only way of life doesn't help either.

For those of you who don't know what a derivative is....
A Derivative is when corporation A loans business B;X amount of dollars to default on their loan with bank C, Because corporation A receives X amount of dollars from Bank D.
It's quite possibly the worst possible thing to happen to the fiat monetary system since applied interest.

This isn't for just Bitcoin, It's for all crypto-currency algorithms too, This will have damaging effects on alternative GPU and CPU miners and all crypto holders in general, These regulations are worded to imply that you would need a license just to use Bitcoin for purchases, That includes buying BTC with USD, Trading Doge for BTC, It's all very draconian.

@_date: 2017-03-02 17:10:06
Whatever man, My urgency is not the issue, The issue is that Bitcoin used to be cheap to transfer, Like just a few pennies to transfer hundreds of dollars of BTC cheap, If I were to do that now it would cost me the $30, And what's happening right now is why there's no adoption for American businesses and why there won't be any anytime soon.
What excited me about bitcoin were the cheap fees and decentralization.
Now it doesn't have either of those.
It's become some commodity that no one even uses on a day to day basis as the peer-to-peer currency it is.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:26:32
That doesn't matter, The point of bitcoin is supposed to be an instant transfer of funds for next to nothing, That's not what's happening right now

But who is Mysterion?
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:27:13
I shouldn't have to, That's the whole point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:44:17
I'd love to mine, Now sell me a decent miner from a reliable source at a reasonable price.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:23:38
Actually, No, I haven't...
The price may be at an all time high, but I'm still under on my meager amount of BTC.
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:36:09
This is probably the 4th or 5th best time to buy Bitcoin for Bitcoin.
Crypto does it's best when Fiat is failing and that's not exactly happening right now.....But it's inevitable.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:39:31
Well yeah, It's a nearly identical version of Bitcoin with 1/8th the value and insanely low mining difficulty, Of course miners are gonna jump ship to strip mine the fuck out of it, But they're still selling it for core, That's evident in the price stabalization.
 Hell...I tried to dust off my old BFL Jalapeño to mine but gave up after 2 hours because of lack of driver support for the rig and it's been so long that I couldn't even remember *how to* mine.
So yeah, They've got "hashrate".....But what the fuck can they spend it on?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:24:34
Which is kind of ironic since all you can do with BCH right now is buy more Bitcoin or another alt.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:13:59
It's just the fees, The only reason everyone hasn't switched to BCH is because BCH dosn't have the economic infrastructure that core has built over the past 7 years for them to utilize BCH as an actual cryptocurrency.
BCH is just a pump and dump alt right now.
When we get our fees back down to pennies per transaction, All the FUD will disappear.
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:24:13
And the elimination of 3rd parties.
We need actual adoption of the technology in everyday retail businesses like Walmart and other outlets.

I was screaming exactly this 2 years ago when they announced the regulations.
You haven't seen anything yet, just wait until they start to go after miners, the wording in the regulations are so vague that they can shut anyone down for mining alts with a gpu.
It's fucking draconian.
This is them telling you that you have to do business with their fiat  money or suffer the consequences.

Then what's the point of it if it never becomes the currency it was designed to be.
If people just hodl it will always be treated as a commodity useful for ***NOTHING.***
Furthermore, If it's just the same handful of people that are the only ones hodling Bitcoin, The value will eventually disappear.

The application of interest inherent to fiat currency is one of the reasons Bitcoin was created. Applying interest and loans leads to centralization which is what Bitcoin was against to begin with!
It's a peer to peer currency, Introducing a 3rd party destroys everything Bitcoin stands for.

That's what happens when people keep their Peer-to-Peer currency in the hands of 3rd parties, It gets stolen and the currency loses value. If Gox, Stamp, BTER and any other sites that claimed it was "hacked" never happened;we'd be sitting at 10k right now......probably.
Remember, BTC is YOURS, Keeping your BTC in an online wallet/trading platform is akin to keeping fiat in a bank.

I've never kept large amounts of alts or BTC in any exchange, I've never trusted any of them. Once stealing crypto becomes punishable by law regularly and insured by either the FDIC or a 3rd party, My addresses will stay private.

Not everyone, The only people really benefiting are the exchanges who take a percentage cut from every trade and the very few who get lucky and just happen to have their orders filled at precisely the right time this happens.
If volumes and sell/buy orders are being manipulated then it's fraud.

Seems legit to me....I mean, I'm convinced, Why aren't you?
Seriously, Look at the numbers, They're *actual* numbers!
And days, THOSE DAYS EXIST!
And there's a table, You LITERALLY can't argue with a table, Tables always win.
Stop spreading FUD bruh.

I think with the ever increasing difficulty and the reward drop in '16,Everyone is scrambling for some good mining gear.
Investing your life savings or even your whole credit limit is a huge gamble which may or may not pay off on your original ROI.

meh,I'd rather spend the $100 on a crap netbook or junk tablet and just put it in a safe....inside a safety deposit box....with a poisonous gas death trap.

That sounds fun, But my kids are 2 and 7 and they don't have that kind of patience yet, The road trip will be from Oregon to Florida, I'm planning on leaving 9 days prior to Christmas to try and get to my parents house on Christmas eve morning.

It's like an online gold rush with all the crypto out there,"THERE'S GOLD IN THEM THERE SERVERS!!!"

I'd like to see more user friendly applications, It's hard to explain Bitcoin in lamens terms to a person who doesn't know the difference between a CPU and a GPU.
