This "apology" sounds like the kind of text that teachers make children write down 100 times after they have been caught not behaving properly. Seemingly apologetic and self-reflecting but never really actually meant.


These are not the words of an apologetic troll few days after the act. These are words carefully crafted with the only intention to save as much face as possible, probably because he is still going to be anonymously involved in his businesses, and wants to avoid the negative fallout.

Yesterday their websocket API was very unreliable, inaccessible for large time periods. This may be related.
Also I'd be curious to know whether this has anything to do with the sudden volatility. (trading bots and other tools being affected)

The fact that this picture keeps being reposted shows how financially uneducated the general bitcoin community is.
Just as in physics you don't compare energy with current, or force with inertia, in economics you don't compare transaction volume with wealth, or any of these with amount of money in circulation.

I don't think they are bothered with "money related issues"  if they are asking for donations.
Perhaps the admins only heard about bitcoins in a context where they were presented as the e-currency for buying drugs, (there were quite a lot of such articles one year ago when the boom happened) and knowing that they are monitored by law enforcement already, they think it's too hot to touch.

Yes, the wallet contains a pair of keys for each addresses. But technically it isn't necessarily to create a new address for each transaction, you can reuse them.
I am not sure about the existing implementations, but you could just store a so called seed number on your paper. Math magic could then deterministically generate an infinite number of addresses from it.
The problem is given by the content of the block. Difficulty is adjusted based on the cumulative computing power of the network: more participants, higher difficulty.
Currently the entire blockchain is stored by every node. It is theoretically possible to get rid some parts of it and participate in the network.

It's called lotto pool, isn't it?

Seriously... even this can be buggy? It takes one maximum finding and one minimum finding to determine the two offers to be paired and then one comparision to decide whether they can be matched or not.
This site is a joke.

So, deposits have to be made to the personal bank account of a 17-year old guy in Singapore. To make things legal, an anonymous company has been set up in Delaware, owned by god-knows-who. There was no closed beta-testing involving low-volume trading with some limited number of testers. The prices are determined by a market maker bot, which are known to start loosing money the moment an outperforming bot silently enters their market. 
Seriously, what could go wrong? I am transferring my life saving tomorrow.

Okay, this was fishy from the start, but now it became clear that this is a scam. 
"The ASIC board itself, inspired by the Pilchard FPGA design, was engineered to work with a re-programmable IC, used as a custom SHA core."
There have been a lot of discussions at the official forum on FPGAs: they can't compete with GPUs. If it is not a real ASIC, or at least a structured ASIC, it can't be much better than the current solution. Actually we don't even have anything that would at least come close.
"The board is also equipped with a flash RAM chip for storage of costants."
WTF? What constants? The SHA-256 algorithm needs only a few hundred bytes of constants. Any electrical engineer with experience in digital systems design will tell you that the biggest performance bottleneck is always the memory access, therefore an efficient SHA-256 core will have these values hardwired, as close to the core as possible. And the SHA-256 algorithm basically doesn't need any memory, just a few registers to store internal steps. All the giberish about the RAM is a huge red flag.
The remaining of the "technical" paragraph is mostly a bunch of technical expressions, without actual meaning or information, so I can't even start debunking them.

Unfortunately we pay them for exactly this. Large part of the fees you pay are to cover the insane amount of money disappearing from the system by fraud due to its poor design. 
(that's what "protecting the buyer" means: if your money gets screwed up, we pay you out from the other customer's fees, just please stfu, and don't hurt our reputation)
