He is a problem but lbc support is bigger problem. Seller went into wrong dispute and support dragged it for 28 days

Trusting an escrow system, not a stranger 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:57:16
Update number 2: an update was promised by LBC in 16 hours. We have entered into 21st hour now.

Exchange takes ages to reply for new registrations plus there aren't lots of options to fund exchanges from my country.

More into fixing mistakes I made already. I might not buy again 
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:15:38
I've provided 54 evidences that I sent money. Other party hasn't provided even one. I hope that fills you in with the information you needed. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:34:50
There are idiots like you who won't read the thread completely and start being Judge. 
I posted this in r/bitcoin
If I won't post a bitcoin related thing on a bitcoin related place, should I post it newspaper owned by your daddy? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:00:14
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:56:19
I heard they're fast. You'll be alright 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:59:09
Its 41.5k here and I don't sleep anymore 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:56:09
Unexpected growth shouldn't be an excuse 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:55:32
I was naive. He has 13 blocks 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:58:37
Replied it few times. Mistake trusting an escrow system 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:58:07
Repeatedly said that I was too naive and trusted an escrow system not a person 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:59:59
Why don't you do it yourself? Giving away 8.5k? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:37:02
I understand that you conduct an evidence based investigation and provide evidence based results. Me and your team are done with evidences from my end. I never objected them asking me anything. 
If you've realised, my thread is about providing 8 opportunities to seller and him playing around with your team and your team being actually played out. 
He keeps saying no to everything. Yet you're giving him a new chance. I call this biased. 
People use forums to express frustration. What I've posted here is also being posted in dispute chat but sadly I hear nothing back. You can't complain about my frustration as it's 28th day today. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 06:57:37
Not anonymously but I tried Kraken. They never get back to you after registration. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 04:00:23
Things that I've already sent. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:55:48
Thanks

Not sure how Bisq handles disputes but this was my first trade ever. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:39:53
He was attempting scam. I offered it. He said he trades no less than 50k. Started sending pictures showing he has 70 btc 498 eth and some 500k in cash. I was naive to believe 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:38:07
Thanks mate. Lesson learned 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:41:22
I made a wire transfer request from branch. I don't live in my country. My bank frequently receives and sends international wires for me debited to or  credited from my account 
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:01:13
I learned about it earlier today. Looks very legit 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:38:47
Lesson learned 
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:22:55
Trust me I don't have courage to spend a penny more into it to the point where I recover all my bitcoin back from localbitcoins
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:38:27
Just an update: LBC support contacted earlier. They asked for an explanation and another evidence which I furnished. I'm once again waiting. I will keep you guys posted and thanks to all of you have supported 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:14:28
The country I am living in is fine me sending out funds. I frequently and send transfers of such size and they are fine with it since I am legally registered as self employed and transactions of such size and nature match my declared business activities. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:38:31
I first time heard about these 2
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:37:32
I was literally convinced by this scam artist on phone to make this investment. It was my first trade. I was lucky enough that I found "I have paid" otherwise I opened trade in impression that it will time out automatically after 90 minutes. When I found button, it made him angry and he disputed. The only evidence he provided is 2 messages with 2 different stories. Somehow his story is heavier for support. Also I realised yesterday that he had 13 blocks already with people saying he ask everyone to cancel trade and do pit of escrow deals. 
It is my first ever purchase online. I never even bought an airplane ticket online 
@_date: 2018-07-31 06:15:30
I learned my lesson. Probably will be very very careful for any crypto purchase in future if I ever grow a pair to purchase again. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:42:18
It's not about being slow or untrustworthy. They have asked things out of context 
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:39:52
See a doctor. You need help. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:32:31
Thanks Vera for your response. I hope you understand my frustration as I've kept it cool for a week. We are about to enter in 8th day of dispute. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:41:48
Complete stupidity I realise now. My first ever online purchase of anything 
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:40:05
Thanks mate 
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:13:31
Well, I already did today. Lets see now
