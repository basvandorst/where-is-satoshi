I look at bitcoin as something that I plan to hold for at least 2-3 years -- don't sweat the everyday noise.  The fundamentals are that they can never kill it and it is sound money over the print into infinity fiat money we have now.  People are waking up to the criminality of the world Central Banks and their enslavement of the masses through the monetary system which they control.  Have no fear -- just HODL and you will be rewarded.

Overdraft fees are not punitive they are predatory -- proof of this is that banks will purposely credit accounts before others in order to have overdraft fee occur.  So I gotta say knows nothing about how our banking system works.  BANKERS are CRIMMINALS -- worse than mob.  And banks don't tally over drafts once per month -- how ignorant are some of you people.

More bullshit -- what you have figured out is that $6k is where no knew bitcoin will come on to the market -- this is hodler territory.

Dont buy what you can't afford to lose.  Stop whining and hodl.  I can't stand babies, maybe you should just put your money in the bank.

South Africa is fucked and it is sad, but stealing from one person to give to another isn't right, no matter which side it is done on.  Problem with South Africa is that yes the blacks will steal the land from the whites and they will justify this (which they have a pretty good case for) the only problem being that the blacks are unable to farm the land like the whites do now  (they don't have the skill set - not saying they couldn't learn, just saying at this point in time they know nothing).  All one has to do is look at Zimbabwe and that is the future of South Africa.  South Africa is now being run by a bunch of black criminals that only think short term and about what they can steal for themselves.

I suggest this guy hold on to btc, nothing ever goes straight up -- need to hang on.  In longer term bitcoin will rule, just needs more time.  Governments are corrupt and people will soon this when the fiat system we now have really picks up speed in its death cycle.  Can't print money out of nothing that is created out of debt and think it can run on forever.

Ask these same fools how money is made????  That alone should make them realize that there is a very good reason why they don't know, and why economics is not talk in high school.  The fiat we now use is the actual ponzi scheme and they dont even know it ---- can't make this shit up.  The ignorance of people is amazing.

I see a raise of privacy coins and decentralized trading platforms on the blockchain --- can't stop what you can't control.  Fuck the Central Banks and the banksters, Jon Corizine stole billion bucks and sits on beach, should be in jail.

Technology will be one step ahead of them -- old lies don't work anymore - Trump, Brexit, Greece, Italy election show us that -- next crash (coming soon) more social unrest and people who already know government there to protect establishment against people will look for alternative.  Look at rise of alternative media -- more and more waking up to how world really works and what role money plays.  Never underestimate the ability of a small group of determined people to change the world.  It is the only thing that ever has.  You should look at Martin Luther documentary -- lone monk stood up to powerful corrupt Catholic Church and won  --------Anything is possible.
