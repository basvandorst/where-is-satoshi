This gave me chills.
We should write this on billboards, and shout it from rooftops.
Ladies and gentleman, we are participating in one of the greatest movements the world has ever seen.

Very well thought out, I had never considered comparing bitcoin to language.
Another thing to consider is that it's worth could also be tied to the network hashrate for a number of reasons, but mostly for security concerns.
But on second thought, I suppose the net hashrate is directly correlated to the number of people using it, although not all users are miners.
But cool, you got me thinking man.

Poloniex moderator here.
Consider contacting us, you will receive a personable response, and our staff will most likely work with you directly in implementation.
24/7 mod squad support, and around the clock back end staff support.
I advise contacting busoni or tf2honeybadger directly for the more technical questions.

Oh, like coin mixing?
Cool, thanks.

I stand corrected.
I assume you could use the OP_IF operator to construct a script to achieve this function?
Thanks bud.

What does it mean to 'wash out bitcoins'?
@_date: 2014-08-14 02:39:04
Really cool idea.
But your right, I can think of a plethora of reasons that this capability would come in handy, mostly involving businesses, or possibly a family savings account.
In most cases, multi-sig would suffice.
You raise an extremely interesting idea though.
Edit : As pointed out, a script could be constructed to do this.

Am I missing something?
