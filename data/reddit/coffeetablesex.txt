make sure you have a monitor or a dummy plug in your second card or it may not detect it right. my second card runs its clock speed super low for some reason without a monitor or dummy plug in, the kind that basically fakes a vga plug.

You are a silly person, but I see where you're going with that. No, I do not work for BFL, or anyone for that matter, but I did spend what is now the equivalent of $1200USD so I am interested in anything that would shine light on their actual provided customer service, preferably first hand experiences that included hardware failure or failed orders and how they dealt with it.
@_date: 2012-07-19 23:55:29
I bought the tablet directly from Amazon.com via a gift code for the exact amount of my purchase from spendbitcoins.com
Skyrim was delivered as a Steam gift using steamcoin.com and they even gave me the summer sale price! There was a little trouble sending my purchase to my email address for some reason, even after multiple attempts, so the guy actually went through the trouble of adding me to his Steam Friends and gifted the game to me personally. Very quick, very professional, and very timely when correcting the minor issue, even though it had never popped up before.
I also bought food about a year ago from bitmunchies.com, which was a lucky find because I had just spent all my actual money upgrading my mining rig. :P
@_date: 2012-09-30 20:03:32
That seems like more of a personal problem with policy than a problem with the customer support itself. Support was there to be supportive, they just didn't break the rules for this person like they wanted.
I totally agree with the fact that Bitcoin orders should not be refunded, otherwise people cancel orders like crazy when the price jumped up.

seeing as how a lot of people sell gold for bitcoin, and both are seen as valuable commodities, i would definately say this is on topic.
also, this points out that bitcoin is actually safer than gold in some respects...which i never really thought of before today.
@_date: 2012-01-04 04:19:44
If they started taxing Bitcoin, that would be acknowledging it as a currency, and this could be very dangerous for anyone opposed to Bitcoin.
Also, I thought the entire idea was no one knows how many Bitcoin you really have so they can't tax it anyways.

You said you can't see yourself doing business with them due to their customer service. Do they have a record of having bad service? Have you personally had a bad experience with them? I only ask because I am interested in what you have to share, as I have already given them my business and am curious why you think there would be problems with their customer support/service.

I highly doubt this is anything malicious on his behalf. My concern is that someone is using something like the old Mt. Gox email list to randomly send phishing emails in the hopes that some people used those exchanges.
@_date: 2012-09-18 00:28:59
They must be making far more by distributing the tools and investing the money back into their business immediately than if they used the tools themselves and had more Bitcoin later. Otherwise it really wouldn't make any sense...

If one person held all the currency, no one would want it and it would hold no value.

@_date: 2012-07-31 17:42:03


btc to nmc exchanges are easier to deal with than usd to btc since they use almost identical software(that is if you ever used bitcoin without the GUI). if you set up bitcoin you can set up namecoin. best of all, there are no banks or other bullshit that makes you wait. just deposit BTC then when they sell you can pull the NCM right out and then its just a matter of typing the commands into the program.
while im on the topic, Mt. Red actually did merged minig for a while so anyone who used the reddit pool will have a decent NMC balance(i have about 220NMC) and nothing to spend it on, you could try to buy them directly from people there.

I said it loses it's value with loss of demand. If there is already an established demand users will have no choice but to go to the one source. If there is very little demand, in the case of Bitcoin, people will just lose interest in using it.

Don't know why people downvoted you, you are right. When I was in high school, the term social network had no real meaning to me, but I understood the word social and network independently.
Maybe crypto-currency doesn't mean much to people right now, but the word currency is understood, and that should be enough to get the idea across at first.
If you have to, just tell them it's internet moneys.

which would mean you are complaining about him not searching your precious forums before chatting with an admin about bitcoin, where i thought you meant that reddit had many posts about how dickish your forums were and that you being dicks was old news
in other words, a guy tries to make suggestion to help get donations and your response is "fuck you, you havent read every post here you dont know what you are talking about shut up!"

This would explain why they actually have something this old "in stock" in the first place. They must be seeing enough returns of the same cards to justify not "deactivating" the entry like they usually do on discontinued products.

It will vary depending on your computers power consumption and how much you are charged per kW/h. You have to calculate your block generation, then look at the daily market value to determine your estimated output in USD. Then you need to measure your power consumption in kW/h and figure out the price you'll be paying per kW/h. You can then compare the cost of running the machine to the estimated output. Don't forget to take into consideration the fluctuation of the market, rising difficulty of block generation, and the demand for Bitcoin, then decide if it is worthy of your investment.
Short answer: No.

The fact of the matter is they used the GPUs without permission to mine Bitcoin, which not only violates the trust built between ESEA and it's users, but the increased processing required used electricity, which caused the users power bill to go up while ESEA made a profit.

Well, I didn't say don't have a regular lock too. Just make the sensor in the knob so that you only have to reach up to unlock it if you need to use the key, but that would also mean there would have to be some sort of auto-re-lock feature for when others unlocked it with a key.
More important is what do you do when the power goes out and your door is locked? The mechanism would still have to function as a normal lock when not powered.

In my experience, this is how buying things works. You are basically complaining that the line is too long and you don't like waiting as if everyone else in line wasn't in the exact same predicament as you. Except that if you bought a Jalapeno you are basically complaining about pocket change next to the line of people who put hundreds and thousands of dollars in.

IIRC people have had a lot of issues when PayPal found out they made any transactions involving Bitcoin, so I don't know the legality behind is, but they don't like it in the least.
After Googling the issue a bit I have determined it is against the TOS to exchange currencies with PayPal, though no one seems to want to admit Bitcoin is a currency. Go figure.
