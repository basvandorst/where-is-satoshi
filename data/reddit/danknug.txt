how is copying and pasting a payment code better than copying and pasting a btc address?
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:37:06
After all the speculation I've read about Gox losses due to malleability, this one makes the most sense.
"Hmm.  Some withdrawals don't go through.  We just try those ones again until they do go through."  And then malleability comes along as tricks them into thinking that successful transactions were unsuccessful.  Thanks nullc!

my understanding is that if you make one spend from qt which results in a change input, and you make another spend before that change is confirmed, and if that change transaction was mutated by the spammers, AND qt attempts to spend from that change address for your second spend, then the transaction will never go through.  At this point I *think* the worst case scenario is that your qt wallet might report something inaccurate, but the full impact is probably still being worked out and we will have a proper analysis and explanation in due course.

That sounds more or less in line with what I've learned in the past few hours reading the bitcointalk forums.  The fact that you have been downvoted is a testament that bitcoin uptake has expanded to include the ignorant.
Anyone who would even CONSIDER downvoting your comment without providing some sort of rebuttal or additional information is invested too much emotionally and without technical background or desire to understand how the system works.  Too much human.  Or something.  We need a meme so those morons begin to thirst for an understanding rather than simply a profit.

I was just expecting alot of ruffled feathers from all the people who followed Andreas' crusade against MtGox the previous day.

@_date: 2014-02-15 16:18:04
I think the only way to do it is via this site that I was mentioning.  You would thus have to purchased additional BTC with fiat (from a more functional exchange) and then you could trade that BTC for GoxBTC (getting the lower price for the increased risk).  Sorry if that's not what you were looking for.

I agree with the spirit of your first point, but Satoshi will always be the "champion" of bitcoin, if not a hero, and Andreas recent catapult to fame is warranted in my opinion based on his uncanny ability to explain complex technical concepts in layman terms.
I mostly agree with your second point and this is what I wanted to convey.  I do not "hate" Gox but I certainly have my complaints about them, and I also think that sort of owes them an apology.  Maybe "owes" is not the right word, they have to expect what comes with the territory of being the biggest player.  Yesterday there was so much hate thrown at Gox (from Andreas as well) and yes they did kind of try to put the blame on bitcoin.  But clearly this "issue" needs to be addressed in most every client implementation, including the reference client.  I expect even Andreas is surprised by this development, as yesterday he was quite clear that only Gox's implementation was flawed.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:29:18
upvotes for hypocrisy?  Oh yeah.. reddit.
Just to back up my claim:  Investment is a form of speculation.  Purchasing GoxCoins was a high-risk "investment".  use of the English language is perfectly valid.  But you called it "disingenuous", so you are the one using the wrong term in your claim that someone else is using the wrong term.
I digress.  We can all be hypocrites at some time or another.  To realize it is to grow.

i read it as negative, here's my thinking:
If he was going to resign in response to the petition, it would make sense to do it after the troubles blow over.  First he would concentrate on getting withdrawals back up and running, make some people happy, and then resign as a show of respect to the petition.
On the other hand, if Gox was about to go belly up, resigning from the foundation is probably something that would have to be done ASAP.  So that they are not a member of the foundation when they announce the game's over (and I hope this isn't this case!)
EDIT: I'm pretty sure the release said that MtGox is resigning from the foundation (not Karpeles) so Gox is the one with the membership

If it ends up that mt. gox stole your assets, then yes, go to the police by all means. But please lets stop jumping to conclusions.  Most likey scenario right now is that Gox is just unorganized and slow.  That's a far cry from thievery.

Exactly.  End the speculation so people can work from actual facts.  Maybe it's too early right now, but once this blows over there better be some solid explanations / admissions of fault / whatever since the foundation (I'm assuming!) extolls transparency from its members.

The reason they fell so much I think is just the prospect of "you now have no way to get your funds out of our system until further notice" is a pretty scary announcement.

You could reconcile the balances every so often rather than for every tiny HFT transaction.  Or you could prohibit HFT and only offer the guaranteed exchange to real people making their individual buy/sell decisions.  (edit: or you could simply allow HFT, accepting that it will bloat the blockchain, but I'd rather not)  As for confirmations, not so important when you have a high degree of certainty the transaction is legitimate.  If a transaction failed to confirm then it would be flagged for inspection.


That's fine because the user has to sign each instruction.  Security is in the user's hands rather than the exchange.


Peace of mind on the fiat side can only come from auditing and reconciliation, that's true.  But the bitcoin side can leverage the blockchain to offer a very high degree of transparency and security.

I agree that when someone comes out and says something surprising they should back up their claims with sources.  But in this case, you should have no problem confirming these facts for yourself.  Just look over the first 2 pages of "bitstamp re-opens withdrawals".  "btc-e only stopped withdrawals for 2 hours".  And you can dig deeper into that if you want proof that the reason was to address the same issue that MtGox had reported.

because government intervention is a slippery slope.  Witness all the cumbersome and counterproductive laws that make life difficult.  Here's what I think should happen:  an exchange should seek to be regulated by an authority.  Whatever jurisdiction and authority they can.  Maybe the best they can do is some online gaming licensing commission.  Then they will get lots of customers (perhaps you and I) who appreciate the fact that they were proactive in putting themselves within a regulated framework.

If the hackers were able to trick the Gox engine into thinking fake trades had happened, they could tank the price and then buy a bunch of (real) coins for cheap and withdrawal them immediately.  This was the "lightbulb" moment in this story for me, although I might be missing some details about the 2011 event as I didn't read much past the headlines at that time.

You take it to a mechanic who tells you it has a blown head gasket, and the engine is basically worthless.  I suppose you will say that it was your fault for not taking the car to mechanic before hand, and that is true.  HOWEVER, I am still the guy who lied to you and took your money.

For that to work, tons of people would have had to make the decision to sell their coins at $250.  I think most of the panic selling would have happened earlier on, and at $250 many of those people would have moved back to BTC.  Just speculation, of course.

You seem to misunderstand that escrow would be used to decrease the risk for people selling BTC via PAYPAL.  Your whoooosh was pretty condescending when in fact you're the one who missed the point.

This is the view of the average person, but they don't stop to realize that the fiat system is also quite mysterious (e.g. who are the individuals behind the organizations behind the Fed, how new money gets created, all that fun stuff)


What about: privacy, no transaction/banking fees, no chargeback fraud (just to name 3 off the top of my head)


Can't deny that :)  Although this is a trait of anything that is young and new.  Volatility would decrease as it matures.

This is precisely what I have read about why HFT trading is a bad thing.  It's like profiting by DDoSing the exchange.  We all know DDoSing is nearly impossible to fully guard against and can be very disruptive to normal operations of any network, not just the internet or a financial exchange.  I think OP should address this aspect of HFT in regards to his claim that HFT is a good thing.

So... I guess you're right, the fundamentals are not necessary.  But do you really think Appl can drop much more?

your original comment was an irrelevance.  You accuse OP of missing the point, which is kind of impossible since OP is the one making the point.  Therefore your accusation defaults to him trying to make a poorly thought out point.
His point was, "Bitcoin network seems to be working just fine".  Which is a valid point.  Its operation is unaffected by those trying to profit from a speculative rise or fall in fiat terms.

If you were going to investigate something like this, you would start out thinking who the likely suspects are, for example, it most likely wasn't some random crack head who wouldn't know about bitcoins.  It was someone who not only knows about bitcoins, but in particular the mining side of things.  Perhaps that person hired a random crack head.  How likely is it that an educated person who understands bitcoin mining was the same person who broke into the house?  I would say not very likely, but of course you don't rule out the possibility completely.
How would you go about investigating this type of crime, looking at motives and building a list of suspects, without making some weighted-assumptions?
