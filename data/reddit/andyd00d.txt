It depends on your needs. It probably doesn't make very much sense for average users to run Toshi on their own unless they have a specific need to access highly-indexed blockchain data in SQL.
If you want to simply run a full node on the network [Bitcoin Core]( and [btcd]( are *much* better choices.
If you like the API provided by Toshi and aren't really interested in direct SQL access you can probably get quite a bit of mileage out of the hosted version of Toshi at:  However, should your application out-grow the hosted version you do have the ability to host it yourself.
If you do want to play with Toshi as a learning exercise I highly recommend syncing testnet instead of mainnet. You can accomplish that sync in a few hours and it only needs ~20GB of disk space. There is also a hosted version of a testnet Toshi available here:

Well what would make a small vendor like this compelling enough for an average user to go acquire Bitcoin to deal with? Are they going to have some unique product?
I know people hate it when it's brought up but Silk Road was really an ideal merchant fitting this characteristic. You could *only* get their product with Bitcoin and many average people went to non-trivial lengths to get Bitcoin in order to do business with them. I just don't see what products you could offer exclusively in exchange for Bitcoin that would cause people to do this other than high-demand illicit products (eg. drugs.)

You're relying on them to remain rational -- you're trusting people you don't know. You're also trusting them to maintain proper security such that people who don't have an aligned interest can't hack the pools and bring down Bitcoin for whatever purpose. The core issue is a consolidation of power. That consolidation is a very real risk to the long term viability of Bitcoin. Do you think Wall Street will invest 100s of millions of dollars if they have to trust 2 random pool operators (and their security practices) in this respect?

One issue is security. While ugly, Bitcoin addresses are base58check encoded. What that means is a checksum is baked into the address such that a simple typo of an address isn't likely to result in another valid address. This makes it very difficult to make a mistake with your recipient's address resulting in mistaken payment to another party. The same can't be said when trying to send money to something like DNS name, toys.com, for example. You could easily typo and send money to toy.com which would have a high probability of also being a valid registered name.

Unless a transaction in the new main chain block invalidates the transaction in the orphan block (really side chain block, orphan technically means its parent hasn't been seen but people have misused the term so often and consistently that now the incorrect term is the standard) by spending one of the previous outputs it attempted to spend. Then it is considered a conflict and no longer mineable.

So are you saying, whenever you record a send also record the inputs? How do you record the inputs if not by previous txid[index]?

It matters if he includes the double-spending transactions doesn't it?

@_date: 2014-06-15 22:21:39
Then with statistically certainty (if they can maintain &gt;50% hashrate) they are guaranteed to eventually be able to build a longer blockchain in secret than the rest of the network can in public.
The rules of Bitcoin dictate the longest chain wins. So if the secret chain is broadcast it will wipe out the transaction ledger represented by that section of the old chain -- effectively undoing any confirmation of those transactions.
Suppose one of those transactions were to an exchange to sell a large amount of bitcoin. The exchange would likely wait for 6 confirmations and then release fiat to the customer. Let's say this customer is a corrupt miner with &gt;50% of the network hashing power. They could have begun mining in secret immediately prior to making this transaction and never include this transaction on their secret chain -- rather they include a non-broadcast transaction which sends the same outputs to another address they control. After the fiat is released they would then release their secret side chain (after it built to say 7 blocks, or one longer than the current known public chain) and it would be promoted as the tip of the main chain and the legitimate main chain would now become a side chain -- it would be forked at the point in the chain when the malicious miner began their secret chain. This would wipe out the Bitcoin transaction to the exchange and now they have both the fiat and the bitcoin.
There are other potential attacks as well. The easiest of which is to constantly broadcast a longer chain which contains no transactions (aside from coinbases), for example. This would effectively stall the entire network as no transactions would be capable of becoming confirmed. It would also prevent all other miners from profiting.
**TL;DR** They can arbitrarily control the transaction history of the network from the point at which they decide to begin an attack.

Nah, you can walk or ride a bike.
Yeah, for some definition of "all fucked" we are indeed, all fucked. We will all die, for example.
I mean, the paper spells out many of these but here are some obvious problems:
1) This isn't actually a completely decentralized system: Banks play a critical role.
2) Bank chargebacks: TODO 
3) You are trusting another person to not "fuck up" and lock both your funds.
4) Stating that collateral is to be proportional to predicted volatility is a fairly hand-wavy way to cover that problem. If you could predict future volatility on a time scale of 4 days to 1 week you could be independently wealthy leveraging that clairvoyance.
5) Unless collateral is always 100% the amount of loss isn't balanced nor "fair" in terms of a deterrent.
6) You're sending your bank account information to a stranger over the internet. Several if you plan on doing this more than once.
7) The blackmail issue / holding funds hostage is a real problem. In the real world people pay ransom all the time. 
This just isn't 1) decentralized and 2) trustless so I consider it a fail. It's clever and almost functional but that's as much praise as I'm willing to concede. And that much is obvious to me.

I'm wondering if an exchange could piggy-back off of them in a similar way to ease regulation restrictions, particularly for the early phase. I could imagine a scenario where an exchange doesn't take part in the transfer of funds but acts as a merchant enabled with PayPal. Basically a PayPal-funded exchange. Again, I'd need someone's help with a thorough understanding of the current regulatory environment to know if that avenue merits further exploration. I suppose I could call PayPal sales and see if I can have a meaningful conversation with someone.

I'm not sure that's relevant. I think the issue is the value of the fractions. Consider the entire collection of consumer goods can be represented by a simple pie chart. Let's say the only goods are: food, clothes, housing, and toys. Let's say people acquire these goods in a fairly consistent ratio. 20% of a budget on food, 10% on clothes, 50% on housing, 20% on toys. If the total supply of Bitcoin is always decreasing it means the amount of Bitcoin required to purchase the goods must also decrease proportionally (and wages); and with that the value of a Bitcoin rises.
So say there are 100 BTC in the world. Well the spending break-down would be food: 20 BTC, clothes: 10 BTC, housing: 50 BTC, toys: 20 BTC. Now fast-forward a few years and the total available BTC in the world is 50 BTC. food: 10 BTC, clothes: 5 BTC, housing: 25 BTC, toys: 10 BTC.
People are still buying the same amount of food but they are paying with less Bitcoins for it. I think the situation the author is addressing is simply, if I know I can buy my toys, worth 20 BTC now, in a few years for 10 BTC, why would I buy them now?

You can generate new addresses but it doesn't work quite the same way the reference client does it. Mycelium simply maintains addresses as if they were 1-to-1 with respect to a wallet or account. Really, you should generate a new address for every payment to your wallet. And then spend outputs associated with any of your public addresses to satisfy any given transaction. These will usually be the most recently spent to addresses so you will be continuously cycling through active addresses. It's a subtle difference but significant. With Mycelium this would be much more manual and not at all practical.

IMO it is pretty far-fetched to assume Satoshi wouldn't have seen b-money first. I would also expect that type of cheeky response in the forum if they were one in the same.
"In both cases I will assume the existence of an untraceable
network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital
pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender
and encrypted to its receiver."
I'd be willing to wager both of them had seen this paper as well: 
I wouldn't be shocked to learn Wei worked for the NSA. Are we supposed to believe he makes a living from donations to Crypto++? Trying to find anything about him is very difficult.

I agree. Consumer benefits will help but they will have to out-weigh volatility risk. When I speak to non-technical friends at parties, BBQs, wherever, and Bitcoin *happens* to come up (ok, it's on my mind all the time so I tend to bring it up) they seem scared of it purely because of the volatility. They don't want to be the last one holding a beanie baby / a share of pets.com / a crappy mortgage / etc. They've been burned in the very recent past and are extremely wary. They have families and bills and aren't prepared to gamble with finances by holding Bitcoin. And that seems like a real chicken-and-egg problem. Will increased speculation fix that problem?

In the case of P2SH it's only present after it's been redeemed. I admit it's not a terribly great justification of the existence of P2SH and most of the intended usage of P2SH can likely be superseded by the payment protocol. The payment protocol does require more infrastructure, however, whereas P2SH doesn't, which is an additional aspect to consider.

I'm not convinced his scaling concerns wrt larger blocks are particularly damning. Pruning + UTXO commitment will significantly mitigate scaling issues associated with running a "full" node even in the presence of significantly larger blocks. This assumes by "full" node you simply mean that it fully validates transactions and not one that retains a complete copy of the historical blockchain. These archival nodes will likely be less common over time and won't be required for the network to function.

Something like a P2P implementation of BIP 70 is probably the direction we should consider. Don't ask me what that would look like exactly. The idea being that we don't focus on making the addresses easier to read/type but getting rid of the need for the user to even be aware of them. Registering on some large public system for payment seems weird. We don't do that with any other currency. The need for that isn't really obvious to me either.

I would expect mining to taper vs. abruptly halt. But for shits and grins let's assume 99.9% of miners stop instantly.
By my maths it would take ~29 years for 2016 blocks to be mined with 0.1% of the current hash rate and current difficulty. Only then could difficulty be adjusted again.
    (((3129573174.52*(2^32))/(27691802.89*0.001*1024*1024*1024))/60/60/24/365)*2016
= 28.89866569518832137696

I'd like to speak to the operators and ask them productive questions. Like for example, will they ever support [getblocktemplate]( and if no then why not? Also, would they support miner usage of getblocktemplate such that they can mine for GHash.IO and source transactions from their own node or even other pools. People need to communicate to solve problems.

@_date: 2014-01-06 20:47:18
The implication is that they are on their way to amassing enough resources for a 51% attack to be 100% successful. If both GHash.io and BTC Guild were compromised right now there is nothing preventing the attack.
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:42:05
Well presumably they aren't going to go to those lengths to double-spend on a pair of alpaca socks. But yes, the blockchain would be privately forked unbeknownst to any of us until their merged syndicate created a longer blockchain, at which time when they broadcast their blocks the "real" blockchain starting from the point of their attack would be dropped and any outputs they spent on the real network during that window would potentially be void.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:43:41
I used it to try it out. I don't completely understand taint analysis but it seems like with a few rounds it would be very hard to tie any output coins to a particular sender, definitely so for a human. Specifically, they seem to match several like output amounts and like input amounts so you have no idea which particular input in a transaction was being used to generate which particular output. Repeat this several times and it looks pretty frigging hard for anything to untangle it. I don't really have much continued use for it but if you wanted to somehow launder Bitcoin it seems like a good way to go. It functioned as advertised.

I don't really agree with the statement that Bitcoin Core developers want multiple versions and will go so far as to claim the title is very misleading. I'm only aware that thinks this can be a good thing while most (all others?) I've spoken with seem against (and some down-right hostile toward) the prospect of alternate implementations. Being bug-for-bug compatible with the reference implementation wrt consensus is cited as the biggest reason/risk (and I agree that it is a significant risk.) Granted, steps are being taken to modularize the code base (with an immediate focus on areas perceived to be most susceptible to consensus breakage) for consumption by alternate implementations with the assumption that developers like me aren't going to stop trying because of the aforementioned risk. But then that also means the alternate implementations aren't truly full independent implementations.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:01:36

If you have a reasonably small set of individual users you can simply leverage the wallet functionality exposed by the [RPC API]( Calls of interest: getbalance, sendfrom, getaccountaddress.

[DisconnectTip]( / [ConnectTip]( DisconnectTip would be called first to disconnect the orphan/side chain block then ConnectTip to connect the new main tip. If there were a conflict the transaction would be in the memory pool very briefly until ConnectTip removed it as a conflict via its call to [CTxMemPool::removeForBlock](
If you want to get a better sense of block/tx processing I'd start by looking at AcceptToMemoryPool and ProcessBlock. One is the entry point for accepting a new loose tx and the other is the entry point for processing a new block. The code path for each isn't very long and both are fairly accessible. Understanding the CCoinsView hierarchy can be a little confusing to wrap your head around but it isn't that complicated.

Not really. The individual miner would know they found a solution and could withhold it (it's called selfish mining.) The real issue is (that with commonly used mining protocols) the pool owner decides which transactions to include in the set being hashed (or to be pedantic: which to include in the merkle tree whose root hash is being hashed by the miners.) The decision over the included transaction set to be confirmed is what becomes centralized.

The system should be resilient to human irrationality.
Here's the real problem in a nutshell:
    &lt;hearn&gt; the problem is that the bar for being a miner kept being raised because of the hashing arms race. so     
            naturally you get outsourcing and centralisation, economies of scale
    &lt;hearn&gt; the nature of things is that they tend to centralise over time. normally it's not considered a problem.             
            you get mergers of companies and markets consolidate as the tech gets harder
    &lt;hearn&gt; bitcoin tries to swim against this tide but at the moment it's not succeeding
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:27:33
It's not really about defending themselves. The only people attacking them are those that don't really understand the situation. I'm sure no one wants to preserve the health of Bitcoin more than GHash/Cex. I don't question their intentions nor do I think they'd be willfully malicious. I would assume they'd prefer a solution to this more than anyone. They wouldn't want the potential of one rogue employee taking down their business. All of our interests would appear to be aligned yet there is this potentially dangerous situation before us. We should be working with them towards a solution.

@_date: 2014-03-19 16:41:04
Hashers are looking for hash values with a 0 pre-image. The number of 0s directly correlates to the aggregate hashing power on the network. They are hashing transactions not yet in the block chain. They can play with a 32bit nonce field and transaction order to try to hit a correct solution.  One of the transactions they include is a coinbase transaction which rewards their effort with bitcoins should they succeed before someone else.

2) I don't have a good intuitive sense for how this is going to affect spending habits so I can't comment intelligently on it.
3) Why do consumers care about this again?
The 'cool factor' is there if you're sufficiently educated. It's pretty cool to zap money around with a QR code. Maybe this will be enough to get the ball rolling? I suppose if enough vendors accept it more people will be intrigued enough to try it and they may figure out that it is cool. I think that's the most likely reason I've heard so far.

AFAIK only Dark Wallet implements it.
A stealth address is essentially just a concatenation of two ECDSA public keys and the private keys of which you can certainly individually encrypt with BIP38. I don't know if Dark Wallet has that functionality or not. Never used it.
You could easily encode your stealth address as a QR code for use on business cards but stealth addresses aren't readily understood by virtually all wallets at the present time. The stealth address design is incompatible with the prevalent SPV design things like bitcoinj make use of today so it's questionable how wide-spread their adoption will end up being.
If you want to enable a private payment location via a public medium like a business card you could simply use Coinbase's [payment page feature]( Every visitor to your payment page, of form  will see a unique payment address. And that URL is much better suited for a business card than a QR code or inscrutable base58 string of characters. This payment mechanism is also supported by all wallets as it is just using the common pay-to-pubkey-hash format.

You're an exchange. You send some coins somewhere and you want to account that act in your system. So you need to track what you did (or think you did) somehow prior to it showing up in the blockchain using some sort of identifier. That way if it doesn't get into the blockchain you can credit back the user's account. The hash of the transaction at the time you sent it out into the network is a normal intuitive decision for this identifier, however, due to malleability it is an imperfect choice. So in order to work around the issue you should record and compare the inputs and outputs at the time of spend with inputs and outputs found in transactions which do end up in blocks also associated with this user in order to confirm payment was made as these (the inputs and outputs) are not subject to mutation by currently known malleability techniques and must remain intact for the transaction to be considered valid.

I don't know. You have to be fairly savvy to even have a basic level of understanding of bitcoins and mining. Maybe it's as simple as "gold fever" but gold rushees of yesteryear wouldn't have had the benefit of ease-of-access to determine mining difficulty / projected difficulty. But maybe if they did they still would've tried anyway? There is definitely some psychological phenomenon (apart from some people being ignorant) at play here which is interesting to me.

An alternative could be to use bitcore and only peer directly with your local bitcoind node and don't use the RPC API. Leveraging the wallet functionality in bitcoind is a fundamentally flawed approach, albeit an intuitive one to reach for first.
Have bitcore work with your own Node.js code to do all of the account management and indexing of the block chain and unspent outputs in your database. Node.js is incredibly fast and efficient and high-quality code so don't let the fact that it's Javascript confuse you. The async I/O code underneath is all libuv. It's basically as performant as Boost.Asio but less C++ heavy. High-quality OO C++ code scares people. It can be elegant to write but a nightmare to debug. Probably why the Node.js team chose libuv.
Scroll down and pay close attention to "Monitoring blocks and transactions." If I had to guess, I'd bet BitPay is moving towards this architecture model if they haven't already. If I were going to run large scaleable Bitcoin infrastructure I'd do this. Trying to hack a large service to work solely using a local node and the RPC API is probably a long-term dead-end. It can be done with sufficient hacking but don't do it. You certainly don't want to maintain a fork long-term.

If you represent an address as bits you could measure it just by comparing some # of leading matching bits.
Let's say this is an orphaned address in bits:
1010010101 | 001010111101010110100110...
And let's say you find:
1010010101 | 111111011101110100100110...
They match up until the point where I stuck a |. If difficulty was say 10 bits, you'd have a mined block. If difficulty was 11 you wouldn't. But you'd be able to demonstrate a mining share assuming this evolved to be mined by pools...

Another relevant link is to [BIP 16]( This describes P2SH transactions.

I guess it depends on how you define "big problem" and what the scenario is. Well-written wallet software shouldn't spend unconfirmed transaction outputs (unless it's from the user's own change outputs.) So the problem would not normally propagate to such a long transaction chain. You would also only cause problems for txs downstream from you. Accept unconfirmed outputs at your own risk is pretty much the synopsis.

Ignoring superficial differences (which you have noted) as suggested by OP it would appear possible to me that both were written by the same hand. Look at any large C++ project, even Boost, for example. And then compare these two groups of code (cryptopp + bitcoin.) They are worlds different from Boost yet quite similar to each other. You would probably not even notice the small differences if considered in this order. 
I also found it interesting that Wei Dai was well aware of Boost and even remarked on how his style was far too different from Boost that he thought Crypto++ wouldn't be accepted into Boost proper without a major re-write which would also be problematic for backward compatibility. He did adopt the Boost license, however. And if he wrote bitcoin, he finally put it to use as it uses Boost. Link:

That's the idea. The question is where to get your transactions from? You would have to either run your own node or get transactions from random nodes maybe. I think at this point you're *pretty much* on par with P2Pool with respect to defending against 51% attacks.
I looked at cgminer's source code. It blindly accepts the transactions that come in response to the GBT RPC call. As does bfgminer (by way of libblkmaker.) I *think* if the mining software were changed to get transactions from random nodes (not the one it's requesting templates from) it could use GBT to mitigate this attack.

From: 
Note that there is some ambiguity in the spec as to whether or not the wallet or the merchant broadcasts the txn. I see no reason why the wallet would ever need to be responsible for broadcasting the txn. In fact, it seems potentially wasteful if for whatever reason the merchant decides to negatively ACK the payment. I should probably make a PR to fix it.

It describes using public key cryptography to facilitate a currency via an "untraceable network, where senders and receivers are identified only by digital pseudonyms (i.e. public keys) and every messages is signed by its sender." The missing piece was double-spends. How do you defend against them? The consensus at the time was that a double-spend database would be required. Adam and others on the cryptography list seemed to be coming to the conclusion that a decentralized database would have the right properties but the details of it did not seem to be fully conceptualized.
Satoshi not only conceptualized the decentralized double-spend database but figured out a practical implementation and knew that b-money (for which he also provided the only practical implementation) and hashcash (the only core piece of the implementation's design directly attributed to another source) were the other two pieces required. He is definitely a cypherpunk and also a hacker -- not in the modern perverted sense. He is an engineer, programmer, and a practical problem-solver above all else. And I think there is plenty of reason to believe he is not Nick Szabo.

Logical fallacy alert: CS degree holder != seasoned programmer. Many people graduate with a BS (up-to-and-including PhD) in CS who can't actually write code to save their lives. I would be bold enough to claim it's more common than not.
I'm of the opinion competent C++ programmers such as SN are actually quite rare. His style seems older to me and I would guess he is/was a professional engineer. I would also guess he wrote C++ pre-Boost but is obviously aware of Boost and adopted some of its code without converting to its more modern form for his own work.

They're probably doing you a favor.

And I'm more interested in what it's going to take for the average person living in a G20 nation to start acquiring and spending Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:49:50
P2SH isn't going to help you perform operations which are beyond the ability of the currently supported standard transaction types. It's primarily a convenience for allowing the sender to not to have to care about what the nature of the recipient is, be it an individual or perhaps a group of 3 people where any 2 are needed to redeem the funds.
**Ex**: Imagine a scenario where a company is taking online payments for a product with a QR code on their web site and aren't using a third-party payment processor. Now let's say the company's internal policy is that the 3 most senior people in the finance department must all sign a transaction to redeem those funds for security such that no individual can be in a position to embezzle. The customer doesn't care about that policy, which their wallet software would need to be partially aware of with a non-P2SH multi-signature transaction. They just want to easily send bitcoin to a simple address in a QR code to get the product.
To answer your specific questions:
1. No. That's currently impossible with the Bitcoin protocol. Immediate inputs and outputs are disconnected. Inputs are only connected to their previous output. Maybe if you say more about what you'd be trying to accomplish someone could be more helpful.
2. No for the same reason above but also the Bitcoin scripting language can't inspect arbitrary fields of the transaction structure, like the amount.
@_date: 2014-01-07 00:56:14
I don't know that everyone running some Block Erupters on a Raspberry Pi for P2Pool is going to make much of a difference against the big hardware but the sentiment is appreciated. Mining is a critical aspect to this system and there's no better way to become familiar with it than to try it out. You will likely learn something if you do.
I wonder if it's possible to start actually *penalizing* miners who are achieving dangerously high hash rates? Perhaps a miner-specific difficulty adjustment or something similar? I haven't thought out how it might work. One obvious problem is identification and then what's to stop a splinter effect.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:56:31

@_date: 2014-02-08 23:43:11
You might be onto something. Younger kids who don't have access to credit cards might actually lead the charge. I guess for the same reason people give for the developing nation story -- no access to a bank account / CC but they could use Bitcoin. And it's easier for parents to acquiesce to this. They don't have to worry about giving their kid their CC or even deal with it at all. They can just transfer money to a wallet for their kid and they can buy whatever.

I mean the inputs and outputs to/from the unconfirmed send transaction -- if they exactly match those of a subsequently confirmed version of this transaction in the blockchain I would declare the transactions equal, for the purpose of auditing, regardless of their literal hash.
The inputs are described by the previous txn's hash and their index in its set of outputs.
The outputs are described by the amount, scriptPubKey, and the index in the immediate transaction's set of outputs.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:50:33
No problem, Sam. Yeah, it might be a bit much for a single chapter. I do fancy myself a bit of an amateur scribe but unfortunately I'm not really much for tech/sci-fi, which is why I didn't have an interest in squirreling this idea away for myself. I'm more into historical fiction -- generally Victorian era but I'll indulge in Edwardian literature from time to time. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:59:07
I've looked at GBT. How would a miner decide which transactions to hash?  More to the point, how would they identify which ones are potentially malicious?
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:40:43
The [getblocktemplate]( interface could be used by miners to source transactions from other pools and not use the transactions from the pool they're mining for. This is safe in that a double-spend would be impossible if attempted by either the pool they are submitting to or the pools they're sourcing transactions from. That said, GHash.IO would need to enable GBT support. Also, miners would need to be responsible and configure their software to make use of this approach. This also assumes it is supported in the mining software. We're working on that right now.
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:40:39
What I took away from the event is:
* even the **same version** of Bitcoin Core can fork with itself.
* seemingly consensus agnostic code/dependencies can potentially affect consensus in interesting and unexpected ways.
* current method to resolve a fork is to get a relatively small group of people together on IRC/Skype and come to consensus.
Note: I'm not at all condemning the current state of affairs. Just noting personal observations.
@_date: 2015-04-05 21:10:46
How it gets patched is pretty important to peoples' financial interests and there will likely be a conflict to someone's interests on either branch of the fork. When a bank suffers an outage I don't think they typically go down in such a way that leaves their users vulnerable to double-spending attacks. At least I haven't heard of that happening.

I think this is the simplest answer:
- You are effectively hashing transactions for the current block.
- One of those transactions is the block reward back to the mining pool.
- If you find the solution while in a pool it is the solution which is only payable to the pool's address so the worst you could do is withhold it.

I would assume banks aren't running SHA256 hashes continuously around the clock on huge clusters of hardware as they are subject to shareholders (real banks, not CUs) and such activity would severely cut into their profits.

I made an analogy above which I'm not completely convinced is valid but I'll pose it here again: We don't have 1000s of computers cranking on SHA256 all day in order for one us to view  but with the current PoW model we do need it to happen to spend a single coin.

It depends on the use case. Many applications forgo using TCP for a variety of reasons (usually due to performance characteristics) -- consider any number of video conferencing implementations or online multiplayer video games. TCP isn't perfect for all use cases and neither is Bitcoin.
In addition, TCP is constantly evolving. Its congestion control algorithm is constantly being updated and revised and alternatives to the standard implementation gain more and more traction everyday. So something better is constantly coming along for TCP and the same will likely be true of Bitcoin.

It's very high-level.

Very true but for a certain (extremely popular) application it was replaced by "something better" which "came along." I'm not trying to be contrary to be difficult but claiming Bitcoin will be the end-all-be-all decentralized currency protocol and all development will be rapid enough and sure-sighted enough to accommodate any necessary changes in time to thwart all alternative protocols (of merit) doesn't seem completely realistic to me given the history of the Internet to date.

Equally logical :) Both scenarios aren't mutually exclusive and would perhaps make the ultimate sense. If they did it while being employed by the government perhaps they fear the government would force them to relinquish their coins. I don't know if he'd *really* get that much criticism from the general public -- he invented something and built it why shouldn't he get paid as much as a tech start-up founder?

when a block is successfully mined the miner is allowed to award themselves whatever the current reward is. and the reward is part of that block and associated with their key.

Seems conclusive that this would be a bad decision...assuming the price of BTC doesn't spike to the moon and all.

I would argue most nodes aren't actually contributing to the blockchain. Most of the time their work has no net benefit.

But now that the identity of DPR is (allegedly) known and some of his private keys are compromised, if another collaborator is identified and searched (perhaps due to DPR's cooperation or some other informant) any private keys found of theirs can easily be used as evidence to convict them using the blockchain.


Let's say we reach a point where half of the developers believe a particular patch is crucial to the survival of BTC and the other half do not. How do we resolve the fork? What if it isn't resolved in time? BTC is moving in real-time unlike linux.


I'm not saying it doesn't serve a purpose but it strikes me as very inefficient. We don't have 1000s of computers cranking on SHA256 all day in order for one us to view  but with the current PoW model we do need it to happen to spend a single coin. Is that fair to say?

I guess in the same sense that other protocols have evolved to make-up for TCP's short-comings others may be necessary to address short-comings of the Bitcoin protocol. What those short-comings are that would need to be addressed by another protocol? Hard to say-- When guys like Vern Paxson or Van Jacobson were working on TCP I don't think they were considering video chat applications nor BitTorrent so it's hard to say how needs will change a priori but as technology evolves it is likely that they will. That doesn't mean Bitcoin will be rendered obsolete.

What if that information is revealed outside of my control or by a one-time lapse in judgement? Then all of my transactions with that address are open.


But unless mining nodes are successful in mining a block isn't all of the energy put into the attempt wasted? And most attempts are unsuccessful.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:20:35
I'm not saying Bitcoin needs to be perfect but is it on par with say the Federal Reserve's ability in this respect? The Fed (good or bad) can make a judgement call and has the authority to enact policy which could save or destroy the dollar. But the authority is there and they are incentivized by their continued employment. I guess this can be distilled down to the statement, "central authority does have some nice properties." Further, no one elected the Bitcoin Project as the sole arbiters of Bitcoin protocol policy -- and granted they are not, nodes can choose to adopt new patches but if they don't the Bitcoin protocol forks and the Bitcoin currency is devalued. 
So given these properties and past history of major open source projects (like Linux for example) is it more or less likely that the Fed breaks down or that the Bitcoin Project breaks down? I don't have the answer but the Fed has been around for awhile and how many distributions of Linux have come and gone in the last 15 years? 
(Important note: I'm not claiming I'm correct, throwing up straw men to be taken down is all.)

Developers aren't directly paid by mining.

he didn't actually say anything about bitcoin. he immediately segued into critiquing the dollar. i'd be shocked if he actually understood bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:08:22
Yeah, why not? If the protocol could be made flexible enough to accommodate that it would be kinda interesting, no?

I don't usually go for conspiracy theories but honestly, him being a (former?) NSA employee makes a lot of sense. It would stand to reason he is obviously extremely keen on security and cryptography. All of the professional security researchers I know of tend to go to great lengths to get their names out there. It would be entirely logical for an NSA (or other government organization) employee to want to hide their identity. And to become such an employee they tend to go to great lengths to make sure you're capable of keeping a secret.
