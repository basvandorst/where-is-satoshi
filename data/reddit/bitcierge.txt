Don't get me wrong, I agree with him too. It's the decentralization of security that I find problematic. 
You can share resources to create more secure Bitcoin businesses while letting those who fail to adopt the best practices, or had no intention of securing the Bitcoins, fail. 
One final point, businesses can be secure and still fail.

This would of course require that you have an active bitcointalk account.

Hi, I just opened a new business called bitcierge.com. Doing the legwork for your request is what we specialize in. Since we just opened for business and are still looking for customers I would love to fulfill your request in return for a testimonial (their would normally be a fee). Would you be willing to do that for us?

We are currently looking into many escrow options. It seems that you are referring to this one:  it seems to come from bitcointalk user OutCast3k. He has a lot of activity so we are willing to give it a try absolutely. 
But from you all we are asking for is a testimonial. It would go something like this. We will create a testimonial and feedback thread on bitcoin talk. You reply to the post with a comment about your experience, hopefully positive ;). We will quote you and link to it on our site.
