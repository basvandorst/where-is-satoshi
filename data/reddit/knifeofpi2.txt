Look, I’m not a major fan of either BTC or BCH. I own only small amounts of both. I don’t have a horse in this game. But don’t you think it’s fishy that an account that was mostly inactive - and stayed relatively unbiased about the scaling debate before - suddenly started shilling for BCH, and linking to *Roger Ver’s website* constantly?

Please stop cloud mining! You will inevitably lose money if it’s something like Genesis or Hashflare. These are known scams.

Sent a zero fee transaction then resent it with a higher fee pointing at their own address.

Paging for comment.

Do you seriously believe Verge is private when it uses technology more primitive than what Monero had in 2014?
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:24:26
I thought this was about Monero at first (the hashing algorithm is called Cryptonight!)

Do you even fucking understand mining, or are you just trying to get people to mine for you for free? Fees depend on block size, mempool size, block time, and what people are willing to pay. ***NOT*** the number of miners.

Wallets HAVE been brute force hacked. This is mostly due to idiotic brain wallet choices and poorly made random number generators.

Monero, Monero Classic and MoneroV. Exactly one of them has the support of any developers or cryptographers.

The full node Bitcoin software. It’s an accurate name in this context
@_date: 2018-05-22 00:58:01
Why would they use Vertcoin? It’s not private and the only one out of those three that has a working privacy-enabled mobile wallet is Monero.

But XMR.TO is known to destroy the transaction data so any information will be lost there. They don’t even receive your wallet address because that’s not possible with Monero.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:35:50
This needs to be done.

There is too much friction in the bitcoin ecosystem. It will never be private by default. There must be an option for those who desire the highest possible level of privacy, *now*.
@_date: 2018-06-09 02:06:43
Lightning still doesn’t have full privacy. If you transact with an adversary he can potentially learn about your transaction history. This is not true of XMR.
@_date: 2018-06-03 03:05:26
Radical transparency = all YOUR data is public too. This goes both ways you know.

It’s fascinating to me that Monero tends to be one of the only coins that Bitcoin-lovers approve of.
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:00:39
No, this was the threat: 
“There's a lot of very rich and very powerful stakeholders in BTC.
If BTC's spot ever gets threatened by a cryptocurrency with a central figurehead, what do you think'll happen to said figurehead?
Crypto isn't a video game, this is real life.”

Does monero serve no purpose?

Which is — for the record — a strategy that has been used by BCH developers for some time. Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin XT are all different implementations for the same coin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:06:46
Don’t use the fucking bitfi wallet (mentioned in one of the tweets.) It has horrendous security and is effectively a weak brain wallet on a stripped down android phone.

Article doesn’t even mention which cryptocurrency. At least give Monero the credit it deserves as the preferred cryptocurrency of evil. :(

Monero hard forks every six months and it’s typically non-contentious.
