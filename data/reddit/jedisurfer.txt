all the exchanges have limit orders, you must do your due diligence, binance, gdax, are the major ones.  I'd do more due diligence on the smaller ones, as those are the ones with the cheapo coins.

If you keep it in between btc balances and exchanges it can be fast.  Only if you move to fiat is it slow.

The best advice is just HOLD.  There have been many days where my limit orders have magically hit the low for the buy side and hit the high for the sell. You feel like a genius. But it's also taken a ton of time, mental anguish, staring and refreshing.  Sad part is I've missed some very big run up as even when I pick a high sell limit much higher than the current going exchange rate.  It fills and keeps going much higher.  When I've re entered I've lost fees, exchange fees, and of course a high price etc. I've ended up with definitely less BTC or some alt coins than I should have.  
I do have to say one piece of advice as I exit some coins and buy some others is set a low, low limit exchange ratio price when buying.  Sure you miss out on some buys but they almost always fill because of some flash crash, unsteady hands, fud etc.  
Don't keep changing your limit order buy price higher as those .0001 higher price add up especially when buying the cheapo alt coins, you can sometimes get 50000 more coins but just setting a low limit buy price and not worrying about it.

I would think shorting bitcoin has got to be one of the craziest things one can do.  Yes you can get lucky but when happens if it doubles or triples in a month and the margin calls for 100000 bitcoins comes? Granted I'm no expert on this.

Mind you, this also incurs a lot of risk, look at gox, btce, cryptsy, bitstamp.  You could lose every coin there.

how many coins and how fast does it need to be sold to start a flash fall?  I feel some of these are manipulated but it seems you need a lot of coins to drop things that fast.  Is there a HFT computer doing all this?

on the 10th I sent my bitcoins from coinbase to btc-e.  That took forever in itself.  I think about 6 hours for btc-e to credit it.  6 hours is way too slow.  So once I got it in there I withdrew it to vircurex.  They never received it.   Support keeps saying it was fixed but it's not.  Up till the 10th-1th I never had problems with btc-e.com, I'll be looking to take my trading some place else.

Pretty sure the consumer is always paying for it some how.  They just add the 25 cent fixed cost and the 2-3%  on to the goods.  So the guy paying cash is actually the person who pays the extra for the fees/rewards and doesn't actually use those services.

Can you not set limit orders and not have to watch it.  If you set multiple limit orders you can be there at that exact moment without having perfect timing.

Have not used lightning network but almost any other coin has cheaper fees?  Dogecoin would be faster and cheaper.
