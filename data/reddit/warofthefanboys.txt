Circle sell prices are definitely no longer the same as their buy prices. At least not after you sell as much as I have. Also, their sell prices scale down the more you sell, so they pay a dollar or two less per coin if you sell 10 than if you sell one. I believe they still give the best sell rates, but it's less juicy than it used to be.

Nobody has EVER given numbers as to why increasing the blockchain will make nodes more expensive, so I've decided to do it.
If we increase the blocksize to 2mb, and EVERY block is completely full, this will be an increase of 50gb in one year. It will actually be much lower, as not all blocks will be full, but this is for the sake of dispelling corporate FUD.
Prices of hard drives today are around 3 cents per GB. This means that the cost CANNOT exceed $1.50 a year, or $0.004 (less than half a penny) per day to run a full node with bigger blocks. Less than have a penny per day prices out ZERO nodes. GTFO with your FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:44
Well let me know when you fire up a node.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:09
Tell me how many full nodes are currently run over a 1996 internet connection. Seriously, if more than 1% of nodes are run on a 15ks connection, I will retract all of my support for 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:28:03
If you can handle the 6mb/hr of the current blockchain, you can handle 12mb/hr. There is literally **no** scenario in which 2mb blocks appreciably increases the cost or decreases the ability to run a node. Literally none.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:13:26
If nodes were 100% full, this equates to broadcasting an addition 6mb, or one MP3, an hour. When you look at the numbers, the small block FUD campaign withers and dies. The problem is, nobody knows or understands the numbers.

After two years of asking, not one person ever provided me the numbers to demonstrate why 2mb blocks would be impractical. Fed up, I did the math myself and have proven that 2mb blocks will not impact any nodes. You are providing a hypothetical scenario of an internet connect in which running a full node would CURRENTLY UTILIZE OVER HALF THE THE AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH. Tell me how many full nodes are currently run over a 1996 internet connection. Seriously, if more than 1% of nodes are run on a 15ks connection, I will retract all of my support for 2mb blocks. My guess is it's about 0%.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:31:15


No, only FUD. Increasing the block size does not appreciably increase the expense of running a node.

Okay so my car is definitely government transport then. My wife and I came together to decide how best to spend the government funds we had earned. We were a governing body, so my car is not individual property, but belongs to and is controlled by government.

You should be able to see the actual balance of the wallet by plugging your address into blockchain.info

Is your claim that, because we are a democracy, we are government, and as such, bitcoin is a government currency because we use it? When I drive my car to work, am I taking government transport? I think you're failing to take into account the context of the word government. Government can mean different things, and not every dictionary definition for the word is applicable to every use of the word. The universe is governed by the laws of physics. Is physics a "Government"?

Hi theymos,
Everyone believes that what they are doing is right all the time. Nobody ever does something and actively says to themselves "I am doing the wrong thing, this isn't the proper course of action." I realize that you are acting in this same manor. I also realize that it's difficult for people to change their minds. Nobody likes to say "I was wrong, and I'm going to change my course now." Often, it's the exact opposite, where people will double down on their beliefs despite opposing evidence, due to their "sunk cost" or "vested interest". This is why the anti-vax movement continues to grow and why people raised with young-earth beliefs continue to believe, despite new evidence for evolution and an old earth surfacing daily.
So I understand that you believe your actions are "right" and that it will be almost impossible to sway you, so I'd like to offer a different thought. Imagine you are watching a movie or reading a book. Imagine yourself as a character in that movie. Maybe you are the king in a fantasy world or a high player in a political thriller. In this book, that character actively destroys information and forbids discussion of topics he disagrees with. He makes decisions for the people based on what he wants, not they.
Is this the kind of character you would root for? Would you see this character as the hero?
Thank you for your time.

The blocksize cap of 1mb has done more to hamper bitcoin than any government.

Or just pay taxes on any capital gains. I mean, if you were smart enough to make money with bitcoin, it shouldn't upset you to make just a little bit less...

$5000 was a bubble and everyone knew it was only a matter of time before it popped down a few grand. We'll go through the same cycle again starting before the next halving.

1mb size cap is the worst thing that ever happened to bitcoin. We could be surpassing Visa by now.

I've been around since the inception. This is like the last bubble at 1300. We'll pop back down and a new bubble will come after 2020's halving where we'll see five figure bitcoins.

Move the BTC out of the wallet that it was in on Aug 1st.
Download Electron Cash 
Import your private keys.
Transfer your BCH to an account you create at cex.io
Trade BCH for BTC.
Move the BTC out of cex.io to whatever wallet you want

What about the homeless guy living on the street corner? Can we really call it decentralized if someone can't mine with a donated smartphone? Maybe we should lower the cap to 1kb so homeless Joe can fit the blockchain on his micro SD card.

If you can "barely afford a node" then you probably shouldn't be running one. Besides, your cost argument has been debunked a hundred times.

Are there any actual hard numbers? I'd like to see some definite comparisons of storage space required for 1mb blocks vs 8mb blocks, and a similar comparison of necessary bandwidth. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:22:36
Hi Theymos. While its tempting to simply downvote you out of disagreement, I'd like to actually discuss some of your ideas and hope you will respond.
Bullet point 1 makes no contributions to the discussion, so I will not respond to it.
Bullet point 2: If the majority of minors support BIP101, does this not make the BIP101 fork inherently more secure and reliable?
Bullet point 3: I'm not clear on what you mean by bitcoin economy, but I'm going to assume that you're referring to the exchanges and providers like Coinbase/Circle. Would any of these services NOT benefit from the increased transaction volume allowed by 8mb blocks? If not, why would they not support BIP101, especially considering that in this scenario the majority of mining power will be geared towards mining BIP101 compatible coins?
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:05:02
So if there is a block mined every ten minutes, it would require 420.5GB if every block in the next year was at the 8mb max? Is this the number that people are afraid of?
@_date: 2015-11-21 16:29:09
I think the 1% fee comes from replenishing your BTC. It costs nothing to spend your bitcoin through the debit card, but to buy that BTC back, you have to send money to Coinbase through your bank and incur a fee. Using a debit card that pays straight from your bank gets you the same products for 1% less.
