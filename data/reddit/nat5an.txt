This is an arbitrage bot and I'm sure there are many running on every exchange, since, as you say, it's basically "free" money.  If there's enough liquidity to process trades, the market should be "efficient" in this manner, and opportunities to buy/sell and make money on the spread in prices should be few and far between.  
This doesn't account for the joint movement of all crypto prices up/down relative to fiat (USD).  I think this effect may be due to the fact that most altcoins are priced in terms of BTC and traded only to/from BTC.  When BTC drops in value relative to USD, altcoins become "less valuable" in terms of USD.  This can be perceived as a drop in value, so people sell, which actually drops their value.  The same effect can be seen in reverse for increases in value as well.

Sending *to* a segwit address is not necessarily cheaper, it's spending *from* a segwit address that should be cheaper.

To be clear, nothing else on that list is decentralized or transparent.

Ok, so in a 2-party payment channel, you have a shared multisig (2 signature) tx confirmed on chain with you and the other party.  This is the root of the trust relationship, and it does have to be confirmed on-chain with tx fees paid, and so forth.
Subsequently, privately between the two of you, you have the full history of all off-chain transactions based on that channel, signed by both parties.  At any time, either of you could broadcast the latest tx to the main chain and close the channel.  The fact that both parties hold a valid, signed tx that they could broadcast to the chain at any time is the pseudo-confirmation that you're looking for, I think.  There are also time locks in place to prevent cheating and broadcasting an older, more favorable tx, reinforcing the pseudo-confirmedness of the latest tx in the off-chain list.
Some of the confusion may come from the "network" part of LN, which wraps transactions inside of transactions to route them through multiple payment channels, but at each hop, you're just dealing with 2 parties with a shared on-chain multisig tx output to track, again forming the root trust relationship between those 2 parties.

So i bought this bottle of scotch when we hit 10k.  And I said to myself, I'll open it when we hit 20k.   I thought that was going to involve an exercise in patience and hodling, but clearly I was wrong.  
It's very clear that this rally in price is actually driven by vows to consume one's own genitalia and not unopened bottles of scotch.  I guess my investment strategy is flawed.

The short answer is, "yes, you should own both".  The keys used to unlock your unspent Bitcoin transaction outputs at that time can also be used to unlock the same transactions on the bcash chain.
The longer answer is that  it depends where you "owned" it prior to the split.  If it was on an exchange (e.g. Coinbase) you are subject to the whims of the exchange as to when and whether or not you get your split coins.  If you had them in your own wallet on your computer or somewhere else, you should be able to google something like "&lt;wallet name&gt; cash split"  and find instructions.  A lot of wallets can support both chains or can give instructions on how to claim you coins on the other chain.

Cats are the preferred pet of the eth blockchain. I assume this makes BTC the blockchain for dogs, by default.

Their payment processor can still receive payments over LN, credit the merchant with fiat and pass (some) of the fee savings from LN along in the conversion. Merchant doesn't have to deal with on-chain/off-chain technical know-how or fees, gets instant settlement and fiat in hand quickly.  
I suppose an exchange could require you to transfer money to them in an on-chain tx, although I'm not really sure why they would do that; the LN transaction is just as "real" as an on-chain tx.  The only time you *need* an on-chain tx is if you don't have a route to someone over LN and you want to pay them, or of course to establish/fund your payment channel(s).

Take a look at this chart on blockchain.info:
This shows the current state of the mempool (un-mined transactions that miners can choose to include in new blocks).  Currently they're recommending a fee of 418 satoshis / byte, based on the number of outstanding transactions.  The fee in your transaction is much lower than this at 240 sat/byte, so your transaction is gonna be low priority until some of the higher-paying transactions are mined.  It may take a day or two, unfortunately.  
There's really nothing you can do unless you have the ability to do a replace-by-fee change on your original transaction. Electrum supports this when sending from electrum, but your exchange (where you transferred the coins from) likely does not.

Unfortunately I'm not as familiar with the tech behind channels with more than 2 people.  Hopefully someone knowledgable can chime in.

It's a meme and a "joke".  LN is always "18 months out."  In reality, we'll being seeing the first mainnet rollouts next year, in all probability.

Does Electrum not use a [bloom filter]( to obfuscate the actual addresses it is interested in?

Anything that helps people buy and sell crypto and increases liquidity between coins is good for crypto as a whole.  Bitcoin is the blue chip of crypto currency, so expect it to make gains with the sector as a whole.

It has no intrinsic value; it's not like Folding or SETI where you are doing a useful distributed computation.
The complexity and difficulty of the hashing problem serves to secure the bitcoin network against double-spending and replay attacks which would compromise the history of the blockchain and make the coin essentially useless (insert sarcastic comment about "usefulness" here).  The hardness of the problem is what makes it so that adding new transactions to the blockchain takes a certain amount of time, and going back to edit the past takes a *really* long time.  This makes it economically infeasible to try to "hack" bitcoin by editing the blockchain history or double-spending.
So, its value is that it's hard, and that's the only thing.

There's no information on the blockchain proper that would be able to link those two addresses, as there is no log on the blockchain of something like an IP address that could be used to make such a link.  
However, if you are using a SPV wallet which doesn't hold the whole blockchain locally, you are relaying your transactions and queries about address balances to someone who *does* have a full copy of the blockchain (a "full node").  This person or entity could look at your queries and see that you (your IP address) are asking for balances of certain addresses and deduce that those addresses are related.  
To avoid this security problem, bitcoin allows SPV wallets to request a range of transactions from full nodes, some of which the wallet is actually interested in and some of which are not related to any address the wallet has control over.  The mechanism which is used is called a Bloom filter, and you can read more about it [here](

Thank you.  This post is embarrassing.

If I'm understanding correctly, the first tx will be replayable on the short chain once it reaches same block height, so the double-spend on the shorter chain is an important part of the equation here, and needs to be completed before that block height is reached on the shorter chain.
