so lets say rumors start flying around saying bitcoins will never be accepted as a legitimite currency for major corporations and people start exchanging their bits for cash the value of coins would drop. on the flip side, there are companies with huge mining operations, lets say they start buying coins and hoarding their own, presumably to drive the price up, and then sell them off piece by piece. something like this?

can anyone explain why the prices are so volatile? werent they up to 1200 last  year? i assume its something along the lines of a stock but if anyone has a link that explains this would be awesome!

ok when you put it that way they couldnt actually do that effectively because of the large scale of coins available. well they could, but it would have to a multi million dollar transactions etc. thats clears it up. sorry for the confusion. i was thinking bitcoins were smaller scale.

i think that bitcoins are a bit before their time but i think theyll increase as the years go by and they start to become more incorporated into the mainstream as a viable option for buying and selling products

well the other part i mentioned that theyre mining them as well. so they already have a reserve that theyve built up, and buy coins at a lower price. their profit comes from the mining the price control comes from the buying. all hypothetical of course.
