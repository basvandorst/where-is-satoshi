Coinbase has never lost my coins. Also, your giving people advice on which services to use and you yourself were considering using MTGOX last week, unless I'm mistaken. I've read articles of peoples coinbase wallets getting hacked, but they were very isolated experiences, and were user error for the most part. Everyone I know who has used Coinbases merchant services has had a positive experience with them. That said leaving coins in their wallet for a long period of time is not recommended, best to use offline storage.

Well blockchain is safer since your funds are stored in your own wallet. Also if blockchain's script was compromised unless you logged in during the attack your coins would probably still be safe. Using a service that allows you to make offline wallets like Armory, or something similar is safer than either though.

Due to the complexity of the technical issue, we will be transferring all fiat and Bitcoin holdings to Mark Karpeles personal accounts, so as to better understand the issue. 
Thank you for your continued support.

Great post, like said, I've been looking for something like this.

Total scam, seen variations of this a few times.

can you confirm, please?

So you bought in at $1.50 and you held because you didn't want to change your wallet? interesting point. I guess the profit is just a side effect of "wanting to change the world". Realistically bitcoins won't be stable until they have a higher market cap, and without stability they won't exactly be anything but a store of value. I mean look at any merchant that accepts bitcoins right now. They convert to fiat immediately due to volatility. As soon as the price stabilizes some of them might really start using it as a currency.

7 BTC, wow, so successful. And a college degree? wow. I wish I wasn't a poor, homeless, child slave. I hope Mvfresh tells us more about his success and awesomeness so I can bask in his glory.

I don't think he was contacting you...

Nice! I'm in AZ also, was considering getting something similar.

That is blatantly untrue. Bitstamp has a pretty good track record. Gox sure has hell doesn't. Campbx no longer supports ACH transfer. Honestly, no exchange has that great of a track record...
