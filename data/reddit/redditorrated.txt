Asians know how to receive screenshots :)
Fortunately as a security analysts and senior network admin, I know how to send screenshots.

You use IPtables rules on a Linux box. I personally use Untangle distro on Debian
At work we use Cisco
We have snort and pork rules going to Splunk. I’m not a security engineer, I’m a threat hunter

Fuck’m. Cold storage homie. I want to take this time to thank the BitCoin Proof Of Keys day. After reviewing what it was about I went out and got a hardware wallet 
If you don’t own your private key you don’t own your crypto!
Some exchanges may even be anonymous... Binance hacked? Pfffst! Hardware wallet!!
Theft of crypto exchanges is over $1billion let alone internal theft and deaths. Do we forget the jackass in Canada who held all the keys and dropped dead? People are threatening to kill his wife now. 
Own your Muth-$;fucnwbf’n Private fuc&amp;n key!

Side note. I should have mentioned. Buy two hardware wallets so you have your backup already at hand. Sh!7 happens, clone your wallet and keep it safe in two separate areas.  You can clone your BTC access and not be sh!7’n yourself trying to order a restore device hoping it works. This give you every opportunity to TEST your BCP and DRP , business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan. If you’re looking at this message with a blank stare and have more than one BTC, get your arse up and get someone from the IT apartment to help you and buy him some beer fool!

Security Engineers design. Security Analysts hunt. I’m a network engineer but don’t have the skills of a security engineer.
