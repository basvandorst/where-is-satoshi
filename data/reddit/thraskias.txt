Only if Bitcoin is to take over the world, deflation won't be very slow, it will be absolutely massive. There is almost a whole world economy to be added to the tiny Bitcoin economy of today.

While this argument suggests that consumption will never go to zero, it will still be strongly discouraged. 
Moreover, this doesn't address the issue of long-term investment in means of production. You need to buy food today, but you don't need to build that car factory today, ever.

For what it's worth, I don't think OP is alone with this concern. I'm definitely in the same boat and I suspect there are many others. We're not all libertarians and/or disciples of Austrian economics. In fact, as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, it's not unreasonable to assume that these will become the minority opinions, just as ahm... in real life.
It's not a problem per se, once you realize that there are plenty of potential fixes. Most importantly: it's only a parameter in the code, there is nothing inherently deflationary about blockchain, cryptocurrency technology, or indeed Bitcoin.
It does seem very unlikely (at least at this point) that this parameter will ever be changed for Bitcoin, however. If you think the deflationary economic model poses a threat to its growth as currency, this simply means that Bitcoin will indeed remain a speculative vehicle, a store of value, but will never become the dominant medium of exchange. Digital gold indeed, and only that.
The good news is that there is nothing wrong with that. Other cryptocurrency can play the role of medium of exchange, and Bitcoin can be Bitcoin and still grow and remain popular.

So true. 
For example Paul the Octopus' tentacles were clearly tingling with genius talent that other cephalopods just couldn't *match*. I mean, it can't be just greed for those tasty mussels and good luck 12 times in a row.
Sad he isn't around any more to predict altcoin demises. We miss you, Paul! We remember your certain abilities that others don't have! :'(

And... 286 upvotes. Well, this is highly embarrassing.

It's ok, guys. Austrian economics guarantees that people do spend Bitcoin all the time. Because everyone needs to eat! When will you learn that?

While saying that you won't stop working in the expectation of future revenue is a good argument for  social healthcare and benefits, it's really besides the point when discussing the effects of deflation.
Noone is saying that you'll stop being greedy. What we are saying, is that you'll be less incentivized to earn more money through long-term investment because, almost by definition, your expected returns are lower with deflation than with inflation. No matter how greedy or not greedy you are, fewer returns makes for less appetite than more returns.

Trump too, is a symptom of the current widespread distrust of the establishment, just like Bitcoin. They are different attempts at solving the same problems. Both phenomena can be understood in the same way. Seems a pretty strong and objective link to me.

It's not smart. It's unnecessary. It provokes the widespread frustration about the current lockdown. And therefore it does not further a solution, on the contrary.
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:48:08
True. But do you honestly think tweeting that now is the right place and timing to ponder a philosophical point like that, which completely ignores the damage high transaction fees do to bitcoin at the moment?
Either he's deliberately trolling or he's a complete marketing idiot. I guess it's the first. Pedantry seems more important in his mind than putting his ego aside and actually searching for pragmatic solutions.
Then again, I've probably just described about 75% of the open-source software development community and given a definition of the academic world.
Bottom line is: when he's saying stuff like that, he's not acting in the interest of bitcoin.

Good point!

My thoughts exactly... Projection doesn't get much sillier than this gem.

...and while waiting for cars to become scarce, your economy was shrinking as car factories closed by lack of demand/investment and workers lost their jobs. You're now in a deflationary spiral until things settle at a lower production level. 
That's kind of the point. You'll make a fine Keynesian one day :).

Thanks for your thoughtful opinion.

"The silicon valley utopian idea that the more you pay someone for doing nothing, the more they are incentivized to actually do something productive and useful to society is nothing but a ruse."
The idea of a universal basic income is much older than silicon valley and has only be revived lately because of the fear that automation will destroy jobs.
There is mounting empirical evidence from UBI pilots (at least those that are set up correctly) that the security it provides in people's lives is beneficial for their productiveness, because people waste less time worrying and stressing about how to obtain food, shelter, and the other basics in life. It also has an emancipatory effect that helps suppressed minorities to become economically productive (e.g. women no longer being dependent on their husbands.)
If you're willing to be intellectually honest, you might want to read up on the topic before stating an opinion that is contradicted by factual evidence.

Hearing but not listening. 
It's blatantly obvious that the OP is once again a huge rationalization searching for reasons why it's not necessary for Bitcoin to learn from its mistakes. 
Hey, it's okay if Bitcoin is just a store of value and not a medium of exchange. You can't have everything and those use cases weren't interesting anyway.
Hey, it's okay if there is a huge backlog. It shows how popular Bitcoin is, and you can do your payments in the weekend, right?
Hey, it's okay if transaction fees are so high that small transactions become impossible. Banking the unbanked wasn't a priority anyway for me. We need the rich onboard and they don't care!
Hey, it's okay if Bitcoin is no longer the number one cryptocurrency because the success of other coins is due to stupid people.
Hey, it's okay if people are constantly engaged in the modern equivalent of tribal warfare; it is how it should be. You want us to unite!? That's called centralization, stupid!
Guess what? It's all NOT okay.
Seriously, listen to yourselves.
Curious to see how good smart people are in rationalizing their own mistakes... Continue like this and Bitcoin will end up as the first cryptocurrency and an interesting sociological experiment in self-destruction.

I understand what you're saying and I think it's definitely a valid opinion. What I don't think however, is that it's compatible with Bitcoin remaining the dominant cryptocurrency in the world. 
If you look at really successful open-source projects, you'll notice that they are either run by a de facto (not so) benevolent dictator (Linus Torvalds-style), or they are basically funded by corporations who have discovered that making software freely available is the most aggressive marketing strategy imaginable (cfr. Google hijacking the internet with V8/Chrome to push the browser as OS). These seem to be the two extreme strategies that make open-source technology competitive on a global scale, with many in-between models that would work as well. 
Ethereum obviously employs mainly the first model. Bitcoin still benefits from the first-mover advantage, which has bought it some time to figure things out.
When you insist that (1) there is no leadership within the Bitcoin community, no one person/group taking responsibility to move the project further in its entirety (i.e. not only on a technical level), and (2) it definitely mustn't be colonized by large corporations, then I think it follows that Bitcoin will not remain in the leadership position.
If that's your point of view, then it's indeed not reasonable to expect someone like Adam Back to take responsibility, and then I've got nothing to argue about. 
But I think a large part of the community does want Bitcoin to remain in its leadership position. And therefore does expect some people to act as responsible leaders.
