Oh I'm so out of the loop I thought that happened last Sunday. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:05
I already touched on that in my previous comment. If they lose customers who gives a shit? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:00:23
Lol damn you didn't have to tell him like that...are you his Dad or the other Man?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:31:03
Welcome to reality lol. It's an unregulated free market. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:56:48
When it gets there I'm buying a new Truck
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:21:20
Oh..but they are..
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:22:52
That dude has such an ego lol. Some people can't handle a little money. Dude is so worried about himself and demands respect. If I had an iota of his wealth I'd be giving back. Shit I do have an iota of his wealth and I'm still trying to give back. This guy is embarrassing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:40
Haha well it's going to be a fun night for sure. I remember when BCH launched. The FUD is real here. Just can't imagine why anyone would say yeah it was $3,000.00 4.5 seconds ago, $8,500.00 seems like a good buy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:55
Yeah no worries bro. Best of luck in whatever you decide to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:32:57
Hey, it's me your family. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:56:46
Lol getting down to the truth. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:36:56
Yeah very interesting for sure. It could also go the other way and just go up massively. Decisions decisions
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:38
I mean that's a little ignorant. I am not a BCH supporter by any means but it just got added to Coinbase. You don't think the hordes of uninformed people are gonna go OMG Cheap BITCOIN?..
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:24:05
Lol God damn the amount of panic threads because BTC went to 18k for like 5 minutes lol. It went from $10k-$20k in how short of a period without correction? Lol..
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:29:02
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:09
Lol oh god..... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:04:28
BTC started because people wanted to get away from Government regulation and Centralized Banks and the second their portfolio dips they cry for that same government and regulation to save them. In a free market if a scummy business does scummy things, the customers voice their opinions and if it doesn't change a competitor will rise and take it's place. The people have the power. You cry for regulation and that free market power will be stripped. The guy with $100.00 thinks the guy with $100,000.00 is the problem because he can buy more and pump more. At some point you have to concede that there is always a bigger player but it doesn't mean you can't still play the game.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:38
I smell a Christmas Bull run incoming. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:03:24
People trade though so some need to keep it on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:42:17
Hope it works out for you that's awesome :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:56
Lol I saw the book and I'm like are people legitimately wanting to buy BCH at $8k+?? Will be interesting to see what happens when trading opens up again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:44
Lol the fear is real. This is identical to when Bcash launched.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:44:27
They are just one exchange that experienced issues Bcash was still available everywhere else and has been. Coinbase/Gdax went about this horribly and likely had insider trading but that doesn't stop the Crypto space from being a free market.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:17:38
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:04
Because it's tied to "their" money and most don't want to read and keep up with current events they'd rather "know" that if they buy this one thing they will be better off for it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:31
I don't think it'll take until February. I mean who knows honestly but historically when BTC dips like this it never lasts very long before it sees new highs. Wouldn't be surprised to be over $20k very soon and wouldn't be surprised if it just hovered for a while either.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:58
This subreddit is legit garbage. More and more BCH Trolls. It's organized.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:30
Lol it's a bad time to get advice. You're gonna get so many BCH fanboys right now trying to spread FUD. When BCH launched they claimed BTC was dead and would go to zero and BCH would become BTC. I'm kind of neutral. I think its either extremist BTC supporters or extremist BCH supporters. I am just going off what happened last time. Last time BCH pumped everyone thought "The Flippening" was happening and BTC was dead. Sure enough people took their profits out of BCH and BTC saw new highs. I expect something similar to happen this time as well.
Just watch videos of Roger Ver.... Even if BCH was a godsend I wouldn't buy it. The dude is a total twat and belittles anyone with less money than him lol... He's just not a nice person and not someone I look up to and not someone I'm going to support. Does that mean BCH will be unsuccessful? No.. There's tons of successful people and companies that masses don't like or approve of. I'll be sitting back on this one because I do think we will see new highs after this all blows over.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:20:04
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:52
Lol I'm glad you made some money. Someone in Discord called this weeks ago but I admitted I was way too much of a pussy to put it into BCH but I admitted money was gonna be made off the next BCH pump.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:48
Yeah there is that too. I mean if you can influence elections you can influence some Crypto :p
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:20:17
Because it would tank the entire market lol
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:39:19
Yeah people have been saying it will crash at every given opportunity. I think part of it is just that release of liability feeling like "see I said it could crash"
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:01
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:04:07
Not to mention Bitcoin.com is Anti-Bitcoin, supports BCH and confuses people into thinking it is Bitcoin. It would be fucking hilarious if someone hacked Bitcoin.com and changed the landing page to videos of Roger Ver losing his shit when people call it BCash lol. I'd die...
Edit* Not to mention while all this excitement feels like ground breaking world changing news this literally will be forgotten in a week's time and BCH will still be on Coinbase. Coinbase will release an apology and technical issues blah blah blah and everyone will go back to using Coinbase lol. I'm just annoyed that Roger had so much BTC he will make off like a bandit because he got a tip on when it was being launched on Coinbase and converted all his BTC to BCH lol.. that's obnoxious..
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:01:11
Ah sweet!!!! It'll come. It's gonna feel good to get your place with Crypto money. I've been having dreams of a new Tacoma.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:39:30
Not to mention the price of BCH has been dropping rapidly. Why the fuck even post this shit?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:24:29
It costs money to make BTC so it does have value. If it cost $2,000 to mine a BTC no one will sell it for $2. So it's not like there isn't value in it. I agree it is volatile though as is all crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:44:37
You think BTC2X is going to take over BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:52:51
You know it's hard to calculate in $ because one day I mined 3+ VTC which is closer to $15 at that time other days closer to 1 VTC so whatever the value is $5-$6
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:53
That's factoring in the $0.11 per KW I pay
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:08:35
So let's say BTC is worth $7k at fork, and B2X is $2k. Essentially BTC would be worth $5k right after fork. Is your plan to dump B2X and then wait for BTC to recover to $7k plus?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:36:43
So are the amounts you earn way off on Nicehash and Cryptocompare? They say $20-$25 a day, that ROI is like a few months? It must be way off then..?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:14
If you were to do a rig today what would you choose? I have a Gaming PC with two 1080s that mine VTC right now.
I'd be interested in a GPU Rig as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:13:36
Look up a guide on how to use Gdax it's worth watching a video.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:17:32
Except that with enough adoption their hostile takeover becomes a thing. It's just dumb that it's an option
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:32:07
Yeah I thought about the Dragon Mint but since they are a new company and no specs were released I couldn't drop $9k
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:13
I tried to find some info on that as well but that may not be until 2019 or later?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:59:13
The network is so backlogged right now. Someone linked it earlier and it was something like 160k transactions behind or something.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:29:59
Thanks Slush!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:40:38
Ok thanks for taking the time out of your day to explain this. I've got a decent amount invested already but maybe it's better to just keep doing that.
I was looking at the estimates online, and Nicehash and another Crypto Compare site stated $20-$25 a day so the ROI was only a few months, seemed too good to be true.
Edit* I pay $0.11 per KW
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:37:48
Lol sooo fucking cringey. I'm starting to think the average age of BTC owner here is 12
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:37:13
It's not an issue if both were not going to be active. Unfortunately both are going to be active so it's not an upgrade it's a split. It should have just been an upgrade this whole fork is stupid that's all I'm saying. Too political. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:16:31
Yeah that's criminal. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:01
Yeah using their basic calculators nothing fancy. Don't know how accurate they are. It just seems like a decent way to generate passive income if the ROI is really that short but something's probably off because if it was a 2 -3 month ROI why wouldn't everyone do it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:50:53
105MH/s +/-
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:33:20
I wouldn't look at investing as spending money. Buying Starbucks is spending money. I'm not saying you have to invest in Crypto it's very volatile but you should definitely invest in something you understand and at this point you've got a lot to learn about Crypto!
Check out "Nice Hash" it'll mine what is most profitable and pay you in BTC. Idk your specs but without a decent GPU it likely isn't worth mining anything at all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:34:57
Not a bad invesent strategy but don't expect it to stay low. I don't think we've seen the end of the battle but enough people have been fucked over by BCH already I don't think they will be looking to hop back in anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:46:59
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:54:47
Oddly I don't get much more with two 1080s do it's kind of disappointing lol...
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:31:27
Wouldn't be a problem to me if they just fucking upgraded it but all these splits and forks are fucking confusing and are adding unecessary volatility. BTC should just BE BTC not BTC Cash not BTC Gold not BTC2x but this is what happens when people can't agree on stuff I personally don't know what will happen but I think Bitcoin will likely remain the dominant one and BTC2x will not. No replay protection is a major issue though. This whole thing is stupid to me.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:35:45
Yupp it's Micro USB. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:35:34
So are the stats on Crypto Compare way off? It said I should earn about $25 a day so that's around $850+/- a month profit. Nice Hash reported something similar I believe. So the return on investment is
$1,600 + $200 PSU = $1800 is just a couple months?
