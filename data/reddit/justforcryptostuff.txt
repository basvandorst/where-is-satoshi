You need to use the available solutions if your skill as a programmer does not suffice improving the state of things. So literally spreading awareness and use available solutions is the absolute best thing you can do in this case. Kudos to OP, will upvote every time. Apart from that you are right, obviously.

That's really nice! If only a tODLER could do such things, it'd make for such a nice play on words. I need to make a tODLER so I can use him for karma gainz.

Just try it. Yes it is cumbersome, a pain to use and the routing is still very basic. But it works. having a working system and then iterate on it for solving the mentioned issues is easily done once the groundwork is laid out, which it is now. I just say try it. And don't you see how similar your reaction is to people not having tried bitcoin and saw that it worked yet are against it for some strange reason? You can't discuss with people which have a pre formed opinion on matters through "information" rather than experience.
