Yeah bitcoin is surprisingly strong at the 9 k level which is sad because I’ll never get to use my it’s over 9000 memes ever again. I think market makers won’t push it down to 8500 because they are tired of those memes. Mark my words 9k will hold just to kill the meme.

In all reality the coins probably stay in Coinbase under a Robinhood account. That is probably the most cost effective way for robinhood to hold your coins for you. I also inquired about it and got a response from them.  But I’m not sure how to attach the image to this post.  But they state that coins held through robinhood are not insured.  With all said and done I’m okay with doing business with them.

If it really crashes then I guess it’s time to buy more. Kinda like alt coins but with better potential.  BTC buy the crash.

This long haired guy is more like Satoshi even though the last two great things to come from Belgium are Van Dam and waffles.

I don’t care about Nike or any company that needs cheap labour from specifically China to survive.
