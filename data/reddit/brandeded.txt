^ Not getting enough interest.

Yes for certain... I do not agree with an absolute free market, nor do I beleive in anarchy.

I haven"t quite found myself a niche... maybe people can help.  I'm essentially a free market capitalist, social-anarchist, who believes in heavy taxation on the wealthy, strong regulation on what's legal and what isn't and a strong welfare state.  Go!
See my problem is, several of the points of my ideology contradict each other straight away.  I'm a hacker, who believes information should be free as in people, but who also believes in implementing strongly classified data systems to best to control access to data.  It's like I'm writing two books at once.
Maybe my economic viewpoint and my social viewpoint are at total odds with each other?  I don't know.  :D

Lolz roflolz Iknowrite. (Thanks for your replies, but it's an internal conflict for who's result is irrelevant as I can't actually take any reasonable action being a married suburbanite with a house and a job   Yes? No?)

Thanks!  But would not the exact opposite also be true?
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:41:43
But what makes a social anarchist any how?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:27:35
Thank you.  Good explanation and appreciated.  I have some thinking do... like it really matters.

Aww condescending ass shit falls for a troll.  News at 11.

I see... thanks!  But, if I read the Wikipedia page on Authoritarianism, I do not subscribe to at least half of what it's defined as, so I don't agree with you.  I could actually say that you're incorrect in an absolute sense.

You misspelled Sears.

You can, instead, get boots on the ground by way of utilizing a local VPS, like on vultr or Amazon (
