Exactly: "But most of the money used for the bail-in was Russian-controlled!" Which means in a nation of ~million citizens no one had over 100,000 euro!?!? 
Brussels / Frankfurt played a small game: lets see how many private business suffer when not a single honest citizen has more than 100,000 euro. And for fun, we'll let people just look at their balances - we'll give them a little bit of money each day of course, but really they just "own" a screenshot of what they can't have. With any luck, the bail-in will prove a masterstroke, and then all central banks get to have fun too.

Well that used to be true. If the NSA used certain and specific techniques to assist the FBI, then the prosecution is bound by law to wholly fabricate the evidence chain, so as to not disclose the nature of such techniques. The judge(s) involved are bound by law to approve the fabrication(s) and the defendant is, again, by law, not allowed to know the true evidence chain. This is how terrorism cases are made. And its terrifying.

Neo &amp; Bee does this already; they don't touch any private keys. Bitcoin is about taking more control of personal finance, and so private keys shouldn't be generated by the wallet and/or payment infrastructure provider. Therefore there are no private keys stored in any centralized system, and no possibility of misuse (or any type of use) of customer funds. Instead of forcing a new technology into an old bank / deposit-taking infrastructure, Neo is building the infrastructure to match the full potential of the technology.

In Rand's mind: Selfishness is a rationally valued self-interest scheme. She was just a total bitch, so couldn't stomach not pissing people off, which is sad. 
But if one equates the pursuit of varied self-interests with selfishness, then everything she wrote makes perfect sense. Would she argue that neurochemical benefit is equal or at least akin to monetary benefit? Probably, which makes self-interest, as a governing philosophy, so much more interesting. We can be selfish and selfless - and in a perfectly logical system, there is no difference.

Its not a terrible insightful article, but this single quote was striking, "There are obvious obstacles to implementing such a system, the most obvious being people brazenly voting on legislation they don't understand or haven't bothered to read."
US Reps and Senators never read legislation, and no one understands any of it (at least as a whole). They do vote brazenly on whatever comes to a vote...and submit that such  behavior is their job. In the information age, that is the manifestation of representative democracy: "people brazenly voting on legislation they don't understand or haven't bothered to read."

I had dinner with two Ukrainians in Cyprus last night. They were both convinced that the US would meet Russia head-on if the Russians advanced through Crimea. That will not happen. Obama, under no circumstances whatsoever, will commit US forces. He abhors the idea, he is in his second term, and, I'm sorry to say, he prefers golf over being President. The international outrage over Iraq, is the sitting President of the United States. And if Ukrainians believe they have an ideological (freedom from tyranny) partner in the US, they will suffer for that misplaced faith. Putin knows full well Obama will not act, and has already called his bluff's numerous times. The US military will not help. We are that weak, and I'm very sorry.

The IPVO is finished (ended the day of the first branch opening) and so all "initial shares" have been sold (from Neo, and to investors). All shares listed and traded on Havelock are pass-thru shares (via TAT investments) that directly represent the "initial shares." So if you purchase a share on Havelock, you are purchasing a pass-thru share that is directly and entirely representative of an "initial share." Meaning that all the .0035 BTC per share protections for "initial shares" apply to all shares traded on Havelock. If you are holding Neo shares on the early / initial dividend day(s), then you will receive .0035 BTC per share before any dividends are paid-out to private shareholders.

Each comes with a ~12-page terms &amp; conditions package. With normal-to-large font size and plain language (both Greek and English), they are all easy to read and understand.

Why were Cyprus banks exposed to Greek debt?
@_date: 2014-03-19 11:19:52
[–]zambetis 1 point 1 hour ago
A slightly more polished translation:
The House Commerce Committee reviewed the issue of bitcoin, which in recent months has drawn the attention of the entire planet with respect to its role, the regulation that will need to be considered and the dangers that exist for anyone who deals with the currency. Institutional representatives, the Central Bank, the SEC and representatives from NEO, the company that brought bitcoin to Cyprus, were present.
Central Bank: Stelios Giorgakis of the Central Bank stated before the Commerce Committee that it is not under the CBC's authority to regulate bitcoin. "Since we're not talking about a currency, it is not something that concerns us. In legal terms, bitcoin is not a currency and therefore it is not something we are considering. Neither is it electronic money, so even in that respect we are not considering it. But it should be reviewed as a payments system. Therefore we must wait from the European authorities to see what is bitcoin exactly and who should regulate it. We might eventually conclude that bitcoin is an asset such as oil or gold."
University of Nicosia: On behalf of the university which accepts bitcoin, Christos Vlachos said: "We have many students from abroad studying online. Many foreign students have asked us to pay their fees in bitcoin. This made ​​us review and ultimately decide to adopt bitcoin at our university." Moreover, the representative of the University of Nicosia said: "We are the first university worldwide that accepts payments with bitcoin, we are the first to offer a post-graduate degree for digital currencies and submitted concrete proposals for the role bitcoin can play in Cyprus." "Bitcoin is a decentralized global asset. At times various attempts were made to create something similar, but only bitcoin managed to evolve so much. Many have adopted it, but it is still nascent and has not reached the general public. Just as Google and Yahoo tried to bring the internet to the masses, several companies are trying to bring bitcoin to the world", said the representative of the University of Nicosia. Additionally, Mr Vlachos said: "Think of two people who do not know each other and do not trust each other. Bitcoin brings the two sides together without intermediaries from anywhere in the world. As a university we accept it as payment. As a means of payment, one of bitcoin's many applications, it has many advantages: it is cheaper, faster and easier for transactions." "The university does not express any position on bitcoin as an investment. There are risks as with all investments," the representative of the University of Nicosia noted. Indeed, it was reported that three months ago the University of Nicosia filed a complete proposal to the government to create an industry with many jobs and revenue for Cyprus, with minimal investment by the state.
Kostas Kosta of AKEL (Communist Party) asked the representative of the University of Nicosia: "How come so many universities in the world do not adopt bitcoin and only in Cyprus there is such a move?". Christos Vlachos of the University of Nicosia said: "You can see many articles in renowned media such as the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters. We studied and read about bitcoin and took our decision to adopt the currency as payment at our university. Within the next years there will be big changes and research on the subject from universities and companies around the world."
SEC: SEC President Demetra Kalogirou, taking the floor, said: "It will take a long time before we can decide how much the virtual currency should concern us. As a means of investment it concerns us but not as a means of payment. As a means of payments it mainly concerns the Central Bank. For the SEC and at a European level it is something that concerns us because bitcoin is already used as an investment. Since it is not classified as a currency or other security, the SEC can not give permission to companies to make derivatives with bitcoin. It is premature for us to take a position. Nevertheless, we have issued some warnings for investors to know what risks exist from trading and investing in bitcoin. There are also large fluctuations in the price of bitcoin and this is a risk. For example, it was worth over $1,000 at some time and then the value fell to 400, and therefore someone suddenly lost a lot of money. We are also concerned with the potential problem of money laundering. For example, if someone goes to a bitcoin exchange with a black bag full of euros and gets bitcoins and then buys cars in another country, no one knows where the money came from. Anonymity is a big issue regarding the bitcoin».
Angelos Votsis of the Democratic Party asked the President of the SEC "Who determines how many bitcoins are in the market? Until now there is a specific number of the product so if someone creates more of them, will the price of the existing number drop sharply?" Ms. Kalogirou replied that this is a matter of the university that accepts these payments, but they should probably convert their bitcoins directly into euros in order to avoid risk. The representative of the University of Nicosia agreed with this, explaining how the payment process works, saying that the institution simply uses bitcoin as a means of payment.
A representative of NEO at the Commerce Committee said: "If you came to our store with the knowledge that you now have, I would say that you should spend two weeks reading about bitcoin and then come back again. In our store we talk about all parameters and all the risks associated with bitcoin. We do not give investment advice, we only suggest an alternative payment system. Bitcoin has no issuing authority and is merely a contract between the persons dealing with bitcoin». Ever since the NEO store opened in Nicosia, about 100 people have expressed an interest in bitcoin, the NEO representative said, adding that: "There is great interest from companies and we are in contact with them to resolve the questions regarding bitcoin».
On behalf of the Hotel and Tourism Industry , Zacharias Ioannides said: "Change always frightens and worries people. We see something new in the world market. As a sector we operate in a global economy and would like to have this payment option available to our Customers. Already there are requests from people who want to book hotel rooms for the summer with bitcoins. We want the institutions of Cyprus to give us answers so we can use safeguards that will protect both businesses and consumers. We want protection from wallet thefts."
The Association of Cyprus Travel Agents said: "We are concernced about bitcoin because there is demand for it as a payment option. At the same time, we see competition from foreign platforms that already accept payments with bitcoin».
A representative of the Ministry of Finance had this to say about bitcoin: «The MOF is in contact with European authorities and other ministries of the EU to adopt any European level decision on bitcoin»
A VAT representative stated that there is no taxation and that is something that troubles the European countries.
The Banks Association stated: "We do not offer this product but we are concerned about it, because a client of ours could be a provider or user of bitcoin. However, we need to know where a certain deposit comes from and so there is interest in the issue. When there is a deposit in excess of 10,000, we as banks monitor the deposit." Furthermore, an explanation was given on how deposits from customers are monitored. "If I know that a client of mine makes a 10,000 deposit and suddenly makes a 30,000 deposit, then we look into where the money came from. Moreover, the anonymity of digital currencies concerns us and we are looking ways out of such situations."
The general manager of the Cyprus Stock Exchange Nodas Metaxas said: "By definition, these electronic products are not currencies. However, they are something we will come across and will have to study and decide upon soon. We need to institutionalize a dialogue to see how we move forward".

Gibson - libertarianism, generally speaking, presumes that when people are left to their own devices, they are decent, caring and will assist those in need whilst building a better world for both themselves and, by extension, everyone else. I gain pleasure from helping others, which is a selfish act. Nevertheless, "libertarianism" is as wide-ranging as the number of libertarians. I know hundreds of libertarians, and not a single one agrees on what "libertarianism" is or isn't. Which is partly the point. If people are inherently good, then some vague agreement on what is or isn't "libertarianism" is irrelevant and, ultimately, destructive. People shouldn't be expected to agree on everything, and when they start to pretend to, watch the fuck out. 
Socialism presumes people are nasty and awful, and therefore forced altruism is a social necessity.

I should edit that, I'm pretty sure he is just saying the right things. China is essentially slow-playing the adoption of BTC and if that's the case then he's saying exactly what he should. He's not playing up the bartering angle, and he's very insistent that goods and services cannot be bought or sold. From his perspective, if the People's bank is trying to avoid a bubble in BTC and take things slower, then its certainly in his best interests to do the same. Its not like he has any choice of course, but if a bubble did occur &amp; pop, he would be in some substantial danger.

Both Baidu and China Telecom are regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Which is now the same regulator for BTC.

No worries. Thank you very much for the compliment. 
"the way in which China is going about handling Bitcoin is far superior than the USA. Is that why you conclude it is bad for USA?"
...is correct. The regulatory environment in China is now wide open for the technological development of the Bitcoin protocol. Simply put, China is treating Bitcoin much more like an evolving protocol than the US. By entirely divorcing BTC from the in-place banking system (save for lending...Chinese banks can still lend to BTC businesses) and its' regulatory constraints, China leapfrogs the US. In other words, China has paved the way for BTC to be whatever it may become, whereas the US is still trying to pigeon-hole BTC into what it has been to date.

So, of all the world's fiat currencies, merchants may only accept RMB. But BTC is not a currency; the currency restrictions don't apply. They don't apply to chickens or grain sacks either. Why would they apply to "virtual commodities"? 
He's essentially saying that the only legal transaction for BTC in China is: Fiat &lt;-&gt; BTC. He's certainly in a position to know better than anyone, and maybe that's the line People's Bank wants to him say "for now," but I'm pretty sure they left themselves a legal opening here. 
 
Edit: Listened to the rest of it now, thanks for posting. It seems that China's regulatory strategy is to control the adoption rate of BTC as much as possible. Assuming that NOT mentioning bartering in the announcement was intentional, then, effectively, China's stance is: "BTC is not a currency, only RMB (and other Fiat - all of which are illegal) is a currency, BTC cannot be used as a currency, BTC can be bought and sold for Fiat, BTC can be used to barter (just don't tell anyone). 
Question for anyone whose background helps answer the question:
What would the immediate / short-term reaction be from Chinese businesses and citizens if People's Bank declared BTC a legal currency and that it can be used just like the RMB? What's the perception of the RMB? Would a sizable portion of the populace make a switch to BTC? (Thanks in advance)
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:00:58
Not necessarily. As long as a "virtual commodity" can be used in a similar enough way to a currency, then it really doesn't matter what BTC is termed. China simply cannot call BTC a currency, but that by no means stops them from creating a regulatory environment that treats a virtual commodity like a currency / pseudo-currency.

Payment processors are banned from processing BTC b/c it is not a currency. In China, payment processors can only process RMB. 
Payment Processors = RMB Processors
So...why can't a BTC Processor exist? BTC is not a currency, so who cares about "payment processors?" They are irrelevant. BTC processors, however, are perfectly legal. Processing virtual commodity exchange for goods and services is only illegal for RMB processors.

All people are people (or...persons). If an amazing fiat currency comes along that could potentially wipe the floor with Bitcoin...I am not going to like it. Why? Because I'm human. See how simple that is? People don't like things that threaten the "reality" that supports their success.
The specific "reality" I'm referring to is: Real currency IS ONLY produced and managed by central banks. It used to be argued, "an IDEAL currency is only produced and managed by a central bank." But of course, admitting that an "ideal" currency is ultimately a matter of choice and dependent on individual preferences undermines the "authority" of academia - which cannot be allowed. In other words, notions of fallibility are best avoided...it's too messy and full of Austrian nutters.   
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:55:19
Technically, a commodity is a contractual set of terms and conditions derived from the nature of the underlying asset. In other words, how the "virtual commodity" BTC behaves (bought, sold, buy, sell, bartered, etc...) is irrespective of how any other "commodity" behaves. BTC can behave more like a "currency" than a traditional commodity, and still be a "commodity."

This is ridiculous. Spending one's bitcoins, "to support the Bitcoin community," is an excellent and rational reason to spend bitcoins. Your, "only two reasons you should," presume that rational self-interest is NOT served by "supporting the Bitcoin community." In fact, it's perfectly rational (and selfish) to spend bitcoin whenever you have the opportunity to do so. I want to spread adoption, I want BTC to make me rich. If I want BTC to make me rich, I must help spread adoption. The hoarding argument is bunk, all Bitcoin does is recast the spending vs. saving balance in favor of an appreciating currency.

That's the entire point. Currency is just a form of contract. A contract that functions in a "currency-like" fashion - such as a "virtual commodity" in China - IS a "currency." 
Q: Is BTC a legal currency in China?
A: No
Q: Can a virtual commodity establish a legally viable contractual agreement b/t two parties such that goods and services can be transacted?
A: Yes.

Oh they know what they are doing. The press release and subsequent media reports headlined with, "China Bans Banks from Bitcoin," and that is far more than needed for American media to call it "bad news for Bitcoin." The US thinks this means they are ahead in regulating Bitcoin, in reality, China is way ahead. They learned from the internet's development - reduce barriers, define a simple base of law and regulation, and then get the hell out of the way. The US will continue integrating Bitcoin into the banking system slowly and with increased resistance and reluctance (to say the least).

Exactly. Their specific language allows for room to navigate in the future, while the PR around such language is meant to instill a slow pace of investment / adoption.

I don't. Here is what I do know: bartering is legal in China, BTC now enjoys legal status as a "virtual commodity," and China has NOT banned BTC from bartered transactions. I'm assuming this was done on purpose and the People's Bank didn't just forget to address a fairly well-known practice (...called "bartering"). Toward's the very end of the clip, Bobby says, "Bartering is a known concept in china, however the ruling or the memo did not touch specifically on bartering, so that is still...we will see how that develops."
Nevertheless, both Bobby and the People's Bank are pushing the message, "BTC cannot be used for transactions; its not a currency." So BTC is legal, but its not a "currency," and yet bartering with BTC isn't expressly illegal? Those are facts, and they only make sense if China's strategy is to manage the adoption of BTC as tightly as possible. They've permitted certain activities (fiat &lt;-&gt; BTC trading), and designed restrictions on others (merchant commerce) with a strong caveat that allows for tight management without lessening their range of future options.

Intrinsic value: "belonging to the essential nature of a thing : occurring as a natural part of something"
Suffice? Here is the rub: People determine what is or isn't the "essential nature of a thing." Gold has no "use" in "industry, medicine, computers, electronics, jewelry" if "industry, medicine, computers, electronics, jewelry" don't exist. Certainly, gold exists "in and of itself," but any use of gold does not. People create the "intrinsic value" of gold. Gold does not put itself to use, people do that.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:56:52

Of course they dropped BTC. It would be incredibly strange if they didn't. Both Baidu and China Telecom are regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Which is now the same regulator for BTC. Until MIIP tells them (and other tech companies) HOW to go about accepting this "virtual commodity," they ARE running afoul of their regulator by accepting BTC. It's not illegal for China Telecom and Baidu to accept BTC, but why would they continue to do so in the same manner as they have in the past? Last week, there was no regulator. Today, there is. It would be idiotic and very much unlike how China works, if they continued to accept BTC w/o guidance from the MIIP.

Economists don't like Bitcoin because they are people and are subject to fallibility.

My comments from the thread you cite above:
So, of all the world's fiat currencies, merchants may only accept RMB. But BTC is not a currency; the currency restrictions don't apply. They don't apply to chickens or grain sacks either. Why would they apply to "virtual commodities"?
He's essentially saying that the only legal transaction for BTC in China is: Fiat &lt;-&gt; BTC. He's certainly in a position to know better than anyone, and maybe that's the line People's Bank wants to him say "for now," but I'm pretty sure they left themselves a legal opening here.
Edit: Listened to the rest of it now, thanks for posting. It seems that China's regulatory strategy is to control the adoption rate of BTC as much as possible. Assuming that NOT mentioning bartering in the announcement was intentional, then, effectively, China's stance is: "BTC is not a currency, only RMB (and other Fiat - all of which are illegal) is a currency, BTC cannot be used as a currency, BTC can be bought and sold for Fiat, BTC can be used to barter (just don't tell anyone).
I should edit that, I'm pretty sure he is just saying the right things. China is essentially slow-playing the adoption of BTC and if that's the case then he's saying exactly what he should. He's not playing up the bartering angle, and he's very insistent that goods and services cannot be bought or sold. From his perspective, if the People's bank is trying to avoid a bubble in BTC and take things slower, then its certainly in his best interests to do the same. Its not like he has any choice of course, but if a bubble did occur &amp; pop, he would be in some substantial danger.
I don't. Here is what I do know: bartering is legal in China, BTC now enjoys legal status as a "virtual commodity," and China has NOT banned BTC from bartered transactions. I'm assuming this was done on purpose and the People's Bank didn't just forget to address a fairly well-known practice (...called "bartering").

@_date: 2013-12-14 02:03:23
Ask yourself this: Why would he claim anything different? China just approved BTCChina as a legal exchange. The language in the announcement leaves plenty of room for future maneuvering regarding commerce, so why on earth would he claim anything contrary to what the PBC wants people to think? 
Another way to think about it: Just because China left a legal door open, doesn't mean they want people walking through it. So if Bobby were to address that discrepancy, he would be - by default - encouraging the exact opposite behavior of what China wants right now.

Bobby Lee is not "wrong." He knows full well the statement was vague and didn't mention bartering. But why would he go against what the PBC wants the public to do? He's already pulled-off an amazing feat by getting BTC legal in China, and, because of how China compartmentalizes industries, is now the de-facto head of the "Bitcoin Industry." Which is beyond impressive, its a miracle. So if the PBC wants to be legally vague on transactions, but publicly clear ("Can't do it, and don't fucking try.") then he should definitely follow their lead. BTC is being phased in, China has made every signal that the "Bitcoin Industry" is going to be allowed, and so however they want to go about phasing BTC into the economy is exactly the same process Bobby should support and encourage others to follow.

Suptho - It's, "Bitcoin IN AND OF ITSELF."
The Bitcoin protocol has many uses. Think of a bitcoin as a "unit of access." When you buy a bitcoin, you purchase access to the blockchain. Currently, the type/value of that access is understood as a "currency," wherein the near-future, it will likely be understood as a form of property rights. 
Lastly, gold has no "IN AND OF ITSELF PURPOSE." If there weren't people around to USE, and therefore, VALUE, the gold, it wouldn't be of value. Intrinsic value is a concept that requires human engagement. If people "value" gold for "many uses," then it has "intrinsic value." If people "value" bitcoin for "many uses," then, it, too, has "intrinsic value."
