**Laszlo Hanyecz** everyone knows this guy right I mean the guy who practically sold all his bitcoins (To be precise: 10,000 bitcoins) for 2 boxes of pizza (Which cost around $ 25) I mean if he would not have done that he might have had 170 million dollars. I certainly hope the guy who got them did not do the same
From the birth of bitcoins in **January 2009 (Price \[16th August 2010\]: $ 0.07)** by a person who goes by the known alias **Satoshi nakamoto** to its rise to glory and at its peak on **11th December 2017 (Price: $ 19,343.04)** . We have been lucky enough to live in this era of technological advancement. Since the rise of bitcoins everyone wants in on the action. And we now have miners but is bitcoin really worth mining anymore. The answer to that is more complicated than it seems to be there are **3 parts to this**
**1.** If you are a hobbyminer then this could be lot of fun but buying an expense miner just for that is not an ideal way to go about it.
**2.** If you consider mining on a serious note then and would want to sell his/her bitcoins as soon as you mine them, then I would say for the month of September 2018 this is highly not recommended cause you wouldn't make any profit.
Why ?
Well the statistics clearly show a declining trend atleast for the foreseeable future and the cost of running a bitcoin mining hardware does not make sense
**Example:** The Bitmain Antminer S9 will cost around $ 3000 and has the capacity of 13800 Gigahash/sec they use 1300 watts of power and assuming a rate of 10 cents/ kWh and the hardware cost is $ 1,600. That is 2 cent/hr so a rough estimate of $ 203.14/year which means you would break even in 2874 days which is not exactly ideal but if you assume free electricity then you would make break even in 435 days which would sum up to a profit of $ 1341/year.
**3.** But now suppose you are like a friend of mine who is mining but not to sell now but on a future date mainly because you think the prize would rise very soon then yeah go for it.
**Do you guys agree with me ?**
