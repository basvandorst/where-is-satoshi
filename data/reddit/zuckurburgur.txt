WTH, wanted to buy 15 hours ago! Now I have the currency ready but price increased. :/
Any chances for it to fall again in next few days?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:28:52
Should donate to funds for fixing California Fires.
Those things are really disturbing.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:11:25
I bought for the first time at 15k, hodling.
Thanks to you all, I've been here for weeks. Learned to hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:01
Tell them it will be worth a lot more till next Christmas. Print them a graph for hope.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:51:28
Because those are "exchanges"?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:29
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:20:21
is it falling? I'm a noob.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:33
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:17:58
What alt are you in? I've decided to move to alts. lol 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:48:22
at what cost?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:33
Will I be able to transfer from that to my personal wallet later?

Even I use Firefox, don't see [this](
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:13:46
It says in this post's description. I think you can post here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:00:16
Stuck at $15,000. Sell or no?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:37
FeelsBadMan. Need a drop to put in some money now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:50:01
Yeah me too. I had to skip a test today.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:23:13
Banned in a few countries. What else can we do?
Governments don't want this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:49:00
Really want to go it lower. Won't make any INs and OUTs after IN. 
Gonna buy and forget that I owned BTC. (That's how you get very rich, right?)
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:46:59
Are you real? Can't give dollars tho :/
How about you give me 0.5 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:44:04
[Bitcoin could hit $60,000 in 2018 but another crash is coming, says startup exec](
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:09:47
My friend panic sodl because futures.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:12:49
I'm aware, yeah.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:01:34
What is going on? Are we not gonna get Lamborghinis?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:10
    Bitcoin is likely to break above $17,364.56 (record high as per Bitcoin Price Index) and move towards $20,000.
    Any pullback is likely to be capped around $14,000, courtesy of the upward sloping 10-day moving average.
    Only a sideways action for the next couple of days, followed by a close (as per UTC) below $10,000 would signal that a top has been made.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:03:17
Gonna need some suggestion.
The exchange that converts my currency to BTC and keeps in account's wallet doesn't provide a private key. It takes 0.0001 BTC as fees when I want to transfer to some other address.
The current price is also higher than the USD cost. It's actually for trading so I can set the prices.
Should I set up a cold storage and transfer purchases there?(It's a small amount.)
It probably is the lowest/best price.
P.S. I aim on hodling for long.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:33:09
How confident are you?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:45:29
was expected
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:48:06
Got ICX at 0.0003960 BTC price. Kinda low now, but I'm hoping for the best. :)
Thanks for advice.
Although it's falling but I am expecting the rise after mainnet launch.
gotta hold
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:02:49
Who are these "regulators"? There are people who can fuck things up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:10:17
Yeah, chances...anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:18:46
No, I don't care about the article. I care about what it says about "regulators".
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:48:08
Finally a change.
I like change!
Let's take a few steps back so we can leap forward!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:40:37
LOL I'm not doing anything. Just wanted to know if you are confident about what you wrote.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:25:49
Is it okay to keep crypto in Binance, or should I move it to some wallet? Also, what alt should be the best and least volatile?
I'll be back in the game as soon as the price goes 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:31:20
So, what would you suggest me if I wanted a volatile alt to hold for 4-5 months.
Or just, like, what according to you would be the best alt for 4-5 months according to your experience?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:39:10
Just woke up, is this a rise of hope?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:33:22
I need your faith.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:51:29




How deep the impact could be?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:02:55
Possibly created a secondary account.
Even I did.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:59:30
Any predictions?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:36
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:21:17
Nope. I hope for it to go 14.5k.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:32:56
You mean [blockchain](
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:33:02
What happens if my wallet provider decides to shut down all of a sudden and hide?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:12:41
A good time to buy would be now or at 10k?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:44:39
GIF wisely chosen. Upvote!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:09:45
Definitely waiting for a correction now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:02:36
I saw each of them carefully and both of them seem good.
I don't have enough to invest in both, what should I go for? I'm thinking ICX.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:55:41
What are the things that I need to keep in mind to expect a climb or a fall?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:56:39


The point is that I have no degree rn. That's why I'm taking the chances. I've been just watching the BTC since last 2 years.
I ignored the hype and kept my gaming and studying going.
After the sudden growth of BTC, I was seduced by it.
I am 17, not eligible to buy BTC on my own because no exchange here support it.
I decided to get my parents involved and they are pretty hesitant. So we came to a settlement:
Get some on HODL, forget and get back to normal life.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:20:09
Moved to ICX, then LEND, then XRP.
I increased my BTC amount.
This has been a good learning week.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:45:16
Kinda destroyed sleep timings.
I got my friend to buy at 13k yesterday but he sold at 15k before futures.
All my interests are now drained into BTC and I cannot do anything else unless I buy at good price to hodl.
I want to wait before I buy, should I?
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:03:12
Are we gonna rise?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:36:03
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:11:53
HODL, frand.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:55:30
Suggest a good Antminer.
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:19:30
I'd like to buy more before that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:33:19
Is it expected to go down again?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:33:10

I was like "WTF is going on?"
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:03:45


Some countries will have Monday.
If not, then yes, nothing will happen at 6pm. We shall wait for atleast 2 days.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:19:32
Sir, I've never believed it would reach 7-8k, but now that you said it.
We shall all use the force to make it fall more!
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:45:45
Are we falling again?
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:42:27
Good luck, mate!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:06:37
Yeah, seems like it.

" But bitcoin's maturity is also likely to push newer investors toward higher yields, and as expected, we have seen bitcoin itself losing its dominance over the last five years.
This is a sign of the markets starting to mature. A fully digital economy should not be 95 percent money. All industries will eventually fill this economy.
Newer coins are outperforming older coins in general. Also buying the entire market tends to be neutral in performance."

Welp, I am seeing something on the bitcointicker now....

What would be the amount of coin for a middle class person to keep on hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:25:30
I win.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:17:07
Why 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:28:49
What dip?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:34:04
I got ICX today after getting advice by a member here on NEO and ICX.
By the end of this month, I'm expecting some profit as ICX's mainnet will be alive.
Also, BTC is now heavily regulated by the whales so I don't think this is the right time to hold BTC.
In the long run, BTC is the best crypto to hold. I just want to buy it when it's cheaper.

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:18:25
Why is he using crayon?!
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:19
Should buy now?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:24:30
I was doing ICX.
Did help for few hours until I decided to buy more and it fell.
Still noob. Will work it out tho. No regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:06:41
The real question is, should I buy more right now even when I am in a minor loss?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:28:10
I've been doing the same. But on a very lower scale.

When is it gonna go back to 20k, I shall meditate to it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:20:20
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:52:55
back to sleep, will wake up at 15k

" Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, has called bitcoin "a fraud" that will eventually "blow up." But Dimon also said he thought the blockchain technology was "good" and could be used to make transactions faster and easier.  "

You can play with it if you got a shit ton of money, yeah?
It's not the government. It's the people(whales) who can.
