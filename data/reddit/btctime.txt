So according to you anyone using a checking account rather than a credit card is using a prepaid card model? You have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2019-04-10 05:57:03
You don't know what you are talking about. You are conflating nodes with a bunch of things while simultaneously ignoring the main point of running your own node - interacting with the bitcoin network in a trustless manner.
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:25:53
No it's not possible now. I was just curious as to why no one would try and make such a system.
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:36:39
This is a recipe for losing all your bitcoin. Look into how change addresses work.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:49:21
Bitcoin is decentralised and has no central governance. That's the whole point. Only on a centrally controlled shitcoin like bcash can you force everyone to do what you want. Segwit os actually a nice example of how consensus changes need to be planned for months or even years in advance.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:02:39
One more thing to mention. LND is really only properly usable by using CLI. This is a deliberate choice by the devs so that noobs don't come in and lose money while the network is still very young. This is changing quickly, but to argue the system is difficult to use at the moment without mentioning this is a bit disingenuous.

I suggest you save these comments and come back to them in a year.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:45:52
To add to this, by supporting malicious bitcoin companies you are actually devaluing your own investment. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:46:32
There is no 'control' over the network. People are free to route around him or set up their own well connected nodes to compete. Unlike traditional finance there is very low barriers to entry.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:50:14
His point is valid. The community is bitcoin's white blood cells which need to actively fight against misinformation and propaganda. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:32:24
While I have you here would you mind showing me the information for the blockstream channel with listchannels on your lnd node. Should show the problem.  
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:06:49
Nah I have my own lnd node. Was also running c lightning for a while. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:35:38
But the network is intentionally difficult to properly interact with at the moment. Don't you think this deserves to be mentioned? If I missed it, I apologize. Disingenuous may be too strong as I think you have been fair otherwise.

Someone was consolidating UTXOs. Check out [ Whoever did this was being a good steward of bitcoin by doing it at the right time and at the right price. A smaller UTXO set is much healthier.

In fact, I hope he mentions some of these problems and the solutions that are being worked on (splicing, atomic multiple paths, submarine swaps, better fee management, etc). Hopefully he doesn't go down the bcash criticism route and start flinging retarded shit about Blockstream conspiracies and lightning tokens.

Have done hundreds of transactions with a much higher success rate and next to no crashes. Your experience seems to be very different to mine.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:21:57
I haven't tried it myself yet. Whoever recommended you to use that old version in slack should not have done so. 6 months in lightning land is an eternity.
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:44:29
He did and you just flat out ignored it. Use a ledger nano s or trezor. With custodial solutions you are relying on them not running away with your money or being incompetent enough to be hacked. What we have seen from them from the last year or two doesn't inspire confidence. Please learn to secure your own funds.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:28:05
The review seems honest and informative at the moment. Looking forward to part 2. There are legitimate problems with the current lightning network but the devs acknowledge them and have long term solutions in development. Hopefully he will keep this in mind.
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:37:49
I am fully supportive of lightning and run a node myself. Put your feels away, go join the lightning slack and irc and educate yourself. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:59:45
I had a look at some of your channels before. You had adjusted fees to orders of magnitudes higher then default. Route selection is currently done by cheapest fee so that may be a reason you don't actually route all that many transactions. Some nodes might actually not be able to use your node because of fees being too high.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:57:51
You need to sit back and relax. There is nothing wrong with this article and I applaud him for taking the time, effort and risk to at least try out lightning. Maybe the next in the series will be unfairly negative but don't jump the shark. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:05:45
But it seems you connected to your node with Eclair too. So any problems with your node would also show up with Eclair. The version of Zap you used is also really old (as you noted) and has since been updated.

The source code for these products is available to review and you can also use them with other open source wallets. 
You obviously have to trust the manufacturer  but so do custody services so it's an additional vulnerability. You are compounding risks there. If you are homeless then I guess a custody solution is better for you, but I would look at alternatives. Maybe something like [

He hooked up his eclair to his lnd node so if he had trouble sending directly from his node, obviously he would also have trouble routing through the node. If you set up a direct channel with them correctly, it seems very strange to see a failure like this. Are you sure it was the correct node you connected to? Remember aliases don't really mean anything.

If you like the alt right, you will like him. I despise both. I am worried people are going to start associating bitcoin with the alt right. For me bitcoin is politically neutral and should stay that way.
