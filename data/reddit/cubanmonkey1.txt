Where did you get this? I'd love to purchase one of these.

Tell us how it's not extortion please. I'd love to know the mental gymnastics behind this?

Yes, wether it be a hardware wallet like the Trezor or Nano Ledger. Or you can use a wallet on your phone like Coinspace.

Care to explain that to Cuba, China, Venezuela, North Koreans?

You are right, Coinbase does not work in Japan. But I do believe Gemini does.

The only person here who's angry is you bro.

Has to be. I was woken up to my phones alarm at 5:00 AM because I had an alert set for $15K. I was honestly shocked. Like my mouth was wide open.

Well it's a useless government agency, are we all really shocked?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:10:39
That sounds like something the Fed would say. ��

Imagine your life under the rule of lifeless bureaucrats. If not for the men that sought after individual freedoms, you'd be nothing more than a slave to national crippling debt &amp; a piggy bank for the government.

I don't know man. This is nuts. Like what's up with this growth?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:07:26
I personally believe its scarcity and underlying technology, specifically the blockchain, speaks for itself.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:29:06
I prefer Gemini and Coinbase. Imo they're very reliable and have not given me any problems.

You're the one getting angry at others even fathoming a life where taxation is minimal and not a burden to citizens. The government does not have a right to anyone's paycheck. The government does not have the right to kick you out of your own home because you can't afford quarterly extortion money. Get outta here with your fallacies commie.

They can exchange your current fiat money for Bitcoin.
But be sure to transfer your Bitcoin into your own private wallet. This is very important, you always want to be in control of your own private keys.

PREACH BROTHER

How long does it take to wire a large amount of money into Gemini?
Also, are there any fees to transfer to hardware wallet?
Edit: Grammar and question addition.

I'm sorry I'm having a bit of trouble understanding GDAX. I logged in today to check it out. If I limit buy can I use the bank account linked to my Coinbase account to buy directly from GDAX? Or do I need to transfer USD into my Coinbase account first and THEN transfer that USD wallet to GDAX? Greatly appreciated for the info given to me.
