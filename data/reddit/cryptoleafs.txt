Nice that you are taking action. Best of luck!

To be honest, I'm pretty bad at it too, and I should maybe focus more on the fundamental analysis. Haven't found any resources to trade it specifically for cryptocurrencies (but should work the same as any other financial asset).
So far it's just based on gut-feeling. I prefer to invest in coins that I actually believe in Long-Term (like the 2 mentioned above). But always try to day-trade/swing-trade to accumulate more as well.
I feel like we are close from another bull market. So far the markets are stagnant, so I feel good to trade high/lows.
Although it has happened to me that I sold, and then the next day there is a big 50-100 percent move. That really sucks. I guess HODLing in long term could probably be more profitable....
Again, I am no expert here :)

Yeah, I guess there are lots of people who heard of BTC between 2010-2013 the first time.
I noticed it for the first after it was 100$-something. I thought it was way overpumped for some random monopoly money without any real value.
How wrong I was. Don't be sad though. I think we are still early in the game. And instead of being very rich, you will have to settle with just rich ;)

Sorry to hear that man. Have you resolved this, or do you need more help with this.
I honestly have no clue how to help you with this, but I''m sure some people here will know.

Yeah me too. Next time, when we're back at ATH, I'm going to sell a big part, so I'm ready when it goes down again.

Haha cyborgene, how very right you are. 
Have had lots of troubles trading altcoins as well... Guess I would have less stress just HODling ;)
Luckily I am not a person that stresses to fast. Otherwise I wouldn't be invested in cryptocurrencies haha.

What do you mean by that? Is that your goal?
I agree that in a couple of years, one Bitcoin might be enough. But my goal right now is to gather as much Bitcoins as possible.
I'm doing this through trading of different altcoins (some that are particular volatile to trade for me where NAV, IOST, SUB, these all had sudden price spikes that lasted really short).
Set your goals higher ;) the sky is the limit.

Thanks for the reply, will check it again later in the future, when they accept different cryptocurrencies. So far I'm more speculating with altcoins.

The guy looks pretty tired haha.

Check out Robin Hood exchange also. I think they have 0 percent fees. (you have to be from the US though, and I think they have a waiting list, so far a lot of people are waiting).
I'm looking forward when they accept people from different countries, so I can start trading my favorite altcoins there too.
