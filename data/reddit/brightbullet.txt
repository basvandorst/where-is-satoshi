No, there’s personal items that I don’t want crossing over. Simple as that. Stop reaching for something that isn’t there and maybe don’t be so quick to judge. Let’s change direction here now, no more comment is needed on the info i shared. 
In general, it is amazing to see the Bitcoin mining growth play out. A technology arms race will begin soon on the hardware side of this space. Going to be exciting to see unfold.

Can’t risk it ��

Yeah I feel you. It’s essentially a pre-sale of the equipment. The token provides a legal framework behind it because they are actual securities that have to be compliant, and liabilities of the company has to settle. They are incorporated in the US. So it actually provides more protection IMO because they are absolutely wrecked by the SEC if they don’t follow through. Definitely a new approach, but actually redeeming your token for physical product is a great idea when it’s compliant. 
Hugely dividing topic, I know, and I full well understand both sides. Definitely a very interesting discussion to have. If anyone is interested to start a podcast or some shit to talk about these things lemme know lol

You gotta check out Node Haven. They are funding development of 7nm miners through a token sale and token holders are able to get the miners at almost cost. I know it sounds nuts, but I’m pretty confident they’ll disrupt this space and fix a lot of the secondhand shit going on. There’s way more to it... should be having a monthly update coming out soon. They were at Blockshow by CoinTelegraph and Computex in Taiwan.  if you wanna look into it
Edit: they have an entire article acknowledging they are a security and have a legal framework for their sale.. it’s detailed in their medium articles. Also first use case of Act No. 20 Utility Token Law in Wyoming. 
Edit 2: everyone complains about the problems in ASIC development but flame a tangible solution before even looking into it. I know token sales are a HUGE hurdle. But tokenizing assets that are acknowledged as securities is actually happening. And it requires compliance with regulatory bodies.

I have a 2 year account with items I don’t like to crossover into the crypto space. This one is 94 days, not sure why it’s saying 1 week. Either way it’s info, do as you please.

Did you not see what they did with Sia? Difficulty rates were jacked up like crazy months ahead of when when a competitor came into the space they immediately had a miner ready? Yeah okay. And did you see what happened with Monero?

Yeah I’m sure Bitmain is still mining Bitcoin on 16nm ASICs in S9s /s
