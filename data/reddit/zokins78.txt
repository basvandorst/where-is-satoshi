He is either a bot or a troll...
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:44:28
Organic pump preceded by organic dump, followed by organic pump and dump afterward...
Only way for us non-whales is to HODL.  
Stay strong guys, October is historically great month for Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:10:14
Green dildo just raped the bears :)
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:32:27
Ok guys i have a plan. 
Last time i sold on july 13. Bitcoin pumped over 20% in a week.
So, i am gona sell again and you can thank me at 9k.
P.S. looks like this bear trend will make alcoholic out of me...
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:20:34
Guys i believe that we have finally bottomed.
Altcoins marketcap fell from ATH 553 billion to 87 billion yesterday - 84% correction to pre-bubble level of november 2017. Most altcoins lost 40% value from 07-14 August, and panic selling had all elements of capitulation. 
So, i honestly believe that last week crypto capitulated and found bottom trough altcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:59:38
Look, we are back to natural growth!
Bitcoin, you jolly fellow.
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:18:17
Oh look its completely natural and organic dump...
In all seriousness whales took such a huge dump on all of us, i am not sure who will in their right mind invest any money in Bitcoin?!?
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:06:43


That sounds like a capitulation to me.
I am not saying that we will see 20k in next few months, but that hopefully carnage is over and period of stability is to come, with really slow and cautious growth ( or no growth at all, just no more sell-offs )
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:58:48
Looks totally organic to me... 
@_date: 2018-08-11 10:46:27
I am gona buy low now so i could sell lower later...

@_date: 2018-07-30 19:21:06
According to your charts from two months ago, we should be dipping bellow 4000. Well genius looks like you change your clown TA as time goes. 
Here is the link to your crap TA, i am waiting for your comment...
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:33:50
According to your previous bullshit chart we were supposed to be dipping bellow 4k in the beginning of july.
If you really believe 100% in your TA, mortgage your house and earn a fortune...
