Bitcoin was never banned, access was restricted

So best have the Nano S as a backup for the Nano X, right? 
Is it like with old Pokémon games that when the battery in the cartridge dies, the data is also gone/wiped?

The author of this article literally has a picture of Tom Cruise and is named Ethan Hunt.  reporting?!
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:19:59
Where could I learn more about this? Is this compatible with Ledger?
@_date: 2019-11-02 10:41:25
What would make a good long term solution and why is Nano S o my good for the mid-term?

This is not the case for Leger, right?
What wallets would have this issue?
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:45:36
Wouldn’t it make more sense if “fud” be something that stabbed link, while you’re”Me” would be link and Zelda would be BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:17:46
Do you have a link that explains how to set up a dummy account? Any explanations available on this process? How about doing this on ledger？
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:01:43
Which isn’t  anything bad
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:00:16
Thank you for highlighting that, I didn’t know.

I think the worst of it all is the seed phrase / memonic / private key that can allow anyone access to your funds,  I’ve been racking my brain how to keep it safe but printing it or writing it down (laminating the damn thing) just doesn’t cut it. What if I put it in a bank deposit box or split it in two... 
does anyone have answers to that?
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:35:28
Like owning BTC you mean? You’re even on the list with dust in your wallet, lol
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:47:43
I just want to understand more about it
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:33:50
What do you mean?
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:56:11
I think you miss my point, it’s not about being new or not or becoming rich. I had this question in my mind because how the rich list is divided between 0-10 and 10plus and the allocation and of the %.. people also keep referring to this allocation and hence I thought it might be important
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:54:04
Only the Sith think in absolutes - lol
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:41:52
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:34:31
Yes exactly, so how does the distribution shift taking this assumption into account. Is there any data in this regard?
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:58:48
I’ve never implied  that. All I said is that you’re on this list even with dust, even if your ranking is somewhere in the millions
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:32:39
Could you explain how such an attack could pan out? First time I read something like that could even happen. Ledger is selling the backup packs but from my understanding these are simple copies of the private key and don’t do anything of the sort as described in your comment. 
Unrelated related question: ledger has multiple addresses they send portions of a BTC transaction, these splits are managed by ledger, could an attack reorganize ledgers tracking of these “split up” funds?

Please ask your friend for help if you really want to cash out. Never share your private key (12/24 words you wrote down with anyone) and again ask your friend for help - don’t trust anyone on the internet - use a credible exchange like Coinbase and do your own research- a Simple google search will do the trick.

@_date: 2019-12-18 03:30:38
What happened?
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:20:04
Why so specific on the amount of BTC?

We've created a new asset class, where we all agree it would not go away.
