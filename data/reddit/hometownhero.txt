What does that even mean?

What should I do? Cash out? Change exchanges?

Question: If i use armory, i don't get exactly what's happening. If i have my funds currently in virtex, it that basically like having it in a wallet as well? And then armory is just a more secure wallet? 
If i put my funds into the armory wallet, will it show 0 BTC in my virtex account? I'm kind of confused. Thanks for the help.

Yup. Doing that. Thanks!

My family owns a restaurant in a large city. How would we go about setting something like this up? and far as prices and things like that... if they just want to pay with bitcoin, would you calculate what their bill would come to in btc?

Haha, thanks to these turtles. Well, mine took about a week or so, i just got verified the other day and withdrew one bit coin because i've gotta buy some stuff. I'll let you know how long it takes to get my cash in my account.

Was just reading the security features of virtex, sounds pretty good. And nah, i don't have that many, if i did, I'd definitely research further. Thanks for the response.

Did you hit the green verify button? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:00:57
Hey dude, I got the funds already. Didn't take long at all. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:33:35
Np. 2 days. Pretty sweet. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:42:34
I'm with you... retarded.

Thanks for the response. But now what you're saying makes me feel as if i'd be safer with virtex than myself. I'm not computer literate enough to back up, encrypt, etc etc.
