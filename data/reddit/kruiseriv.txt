You don’t realize a loss until you sell.

Depends which hour or the day it is.

You seem to under the impression someone will just set the price one day, and that other factors are not at play.

This quote is incorrect.  Don’t believe me?  Cite it’s source.

So what’s your point?  Not trying to be rude.
Edit:  “you would literally be making trillionaires...”
Who would be making these trillionaires?  The people who are simply speculating?

This doesn’t change Bitcoin’s level of risk.  
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:57:12
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:07:08
Why? 
Edit:  Bitcoin is risky.  There’s no denying that.  Until there’s some kind of trading oversight, it’s value is so easily manipulated that it’s just too risky to be useful for its intended purpose because it’s being used as a store of value.

Good point.  I do know my money is FDIC insured.  And I know people who have lost a lot to BTC thefts (not including poor market performance).
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:52:53
I understand that.  But banks are infinitely safer than Bitcoin is right now.

Yeah, I have a few nice Gorge sunset photos.  
Man, Phish’s Tela back in July.... Hnnnnnnnng.

Why do I get the impression you will end up with the money anyway?
I assume you came here today to tile folks up and make even more enemies so you can justify in your own mind keeping the cash.
Read his last paragraph.  He knows he’ll end up with the BTC, despite having options to return them.
BTC could have actually been something great, but for the reasons it’s great, it’s also terrible.

He doesn’t need to have the intention now.
