Because with the high transaction fees, you're probably going to lose a lot of you money to the transaction fees if you don't send high amounts.

How did you lose it in the first place? If you have the hard drive even if it was wiped it might still be recoverable

If you're going to be investing in alt coins, choose ledger. If not, go Trezor. I have a ledger nano s and it's been perfect for all of the cryptocurrencies I have.

Don't you mean Apple Gold?

In the short term I should say
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:13:36
Thanks you too

So wait is the cancellation of B2X going to drive the price of BTC up or down?

So is the cancellation of B2X going to drive the price up or down. I feel like a moron for trading all of my BTC for alts

It's mostly my legs that are the problem. I can fit in small cars but not comfortably. The steering wheel would always have to be put all the way up and at that point it felt too unnatural.

You're absolutely right. Even if it's fall is not today, no one knows what the technology of tomorrow could bring to the table.

I think I'll wait for the Black Friday sale
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:51:39
Oh yea those are definitely nice. You see, I'm 6'2 so I really don't have much of a choice on what car I can get ��. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:47:49
So wait... What is this going to do to the price?
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:04:15
I'm with you. I like SUV's and big cars so probably a model X or a Dodge Challenger for me
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:50:35
So wait I'm confused. Is this going to cause the price of bitcoin to fall? I too put all of my btc into alts
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:04:52
You know, I think I'll stick to all alts for now and just hodl instead of trying to beat the market in a sense. And thank you to everyone for your great responses.
