I think this illustrates a change in the focus of the discussion from tokens to technology.  From what you can buy with bitcoin, to what you can do with it.

Blockchain technology in it's current form will not work without miners to confirm the transactions.  Miners will not work without incentive.  Incentive will not work without monetization.  Monetization will not work without a system for trade.  It is all interconnected and because of this interconnection it all works.

I don't understand it.  It looks like people go there...tip to this politicbot which is a bot... then the politicbot sends a portion of the tips received back to the people who tipped it in the first place.  Is that how this thing works?  Because that sure seems like people just sending money in a circle.
