Either they're enabling transactions to preferred individuals (ie. Gox insiders, friends, dealings) before the ship sinks, or they are actually bug testing. BTC is a strong platform, with or without MtGox.

Down in Canada. Trading is still live worldwide. Could be Gox's final gasps for air.

I think the difficulty needs to be checked twice.

    npm install bitcoin
The most vanilla version of Bitcoin's RPC on nodejs
    npm install kapitalize
Trimmed down and tamed version of the original
These both connect to Bitcoin-Qt's built in RPC, which should be always be SSL encrypted, probably to your coins another location. 
*bitcoin.conf* is the place to look for RPC settings.
IMO, RPC is bulky and dangerous connecting directly to a front-end node app. Alas, I have devised a somewhat complex way to solve for security...
I have setup a local Bitcoin-Qt wallet with RPC enabled for localhost.
Using nodejs, I installed socket.io on another linux web server to house the application only. I also installed nodejs and the *socket.io-client* package on the local bitcoin box, allowing this box to connect to socket.io as a client. With sockets listening on port 6400, I used *ssh -N -L 6400:localhost:6400 user locally to setup a port forwarder, allowing the local box (the one with the coins) to connect securely to the remote node, without opening RPC to the outside. Now, a public facing socket.io app can differentiate between each user and the server by way of checking for a private key after connecting, which only the bitcoin box would send. It's like adding a strict firewall between any commands that would manipulate coins.
The object is this, clients communicate with the remote node, which sends commands to the local node. *Socket.io-client* and *kapitalize* can execute them using localhost RPC if the commands pass security and integrity checks, say checking that the command checks up with a database first. Nobody can hack your storefront and gain access to your coins.
tldr; 
    npm install kapitalize

The building they were storing their servers was being transferred to a local telecom company. Apparently, the hacker called the building and asked a technician to reboot their server in safe mode. Then he proceeded to login and steal everything out of the running wallet. Canadian Bitcoins says it keeps most of it's coins offline, and refunded customers the full amount.

Fiat makes it's way into bitcoin all the time, it's about getting it back out safely and easily. Those who are willing to get some large trading avenues, ones that often require time and identification, should find ways to trickle down back to fiat with anonymity in mind. This could be through machines or online services that use the technology to move money efficiently and relatively anonymously in and out of currencies, both crypto and fiat.
Trust is the biggest issue with Crypto, not in the technology but in the industry built around it.

There are so many people calling for a crash, demise, or a fall. I'd expect a pretty steady ship for a while, as more people start using Bitcoin to invest in the things that they usually use fiat for, as oppose to just treating the currency like a stock price.

With this company, I ended up changing it to peg the price to USD. In this market, it seems that's whats required.
