What're the perks of Counbase Pro and is it newbie friendly?
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:25:23
How? The price is still extremely low in comparison to what it was before. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:10:05
Thank you I didn't even consider that.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:05:44
What does that even mean? It's beautiful but I'm confused.
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:55:41
Why wouldn't they? Things have happened in the past it's always recovered. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:37:56
Ok that's great news. I know this question is kinda dumb but I'm just so new to this that I'm a bit on edge. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:29:48
This is great to add into the comments thanks for the advice. What does "locked up" mean though?
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:43:23
Yeah that's understandable but I'm going on the idea that a lot of people thought like you when it first started and now look at it. Of course it's dropping in price but even if it dies out in the next few months it made it extremely far and pioneered a new wave of currency now it's proven that it can be done. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:40:54
Thanks the videos are going to be extremely helpful.

I don't have the money for a whole coin. It'd just be about $30 invested. I am waiting a bit I check every so often to see if it's going up or down and I'm hoping to take my chance and the right time.

I know what I bought but I'm looking at what the sell price of what I have and when the price of btc goes up my sell price goes down. Why?
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:27:57
But like, science already explained that. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:36:51
I feel like I'm looking at gold it makes me happy to know this is an option and I have another chance since I missed the first wave of cheap bitcoin when it started. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:35:53
It's the lowest I've ever seen it. I didn't have internet when it first started up so this is low to me. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:37:35
I was just planning on putting it in my wallet on my computer which is risky but it's my only option. By the tech what do you mean, like the wallets?
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:03:24
I'm not looking to find trend I'm looking to see when would be a good time for me to buy since it's cheap. Of course the overall trend could fuck me over but it's something worth taking.
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:39:47
It's a small amount with some added from my brother so my only worry is paying him back which could be resolved easy if all this goes bad. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 09:41:03
I wish, that'd be a dream come true if I could see another day that bitcoin is so cheap I'd put way more than $2 into it. Coffee is overrated also.

I don't think everyone here is a blind zealot I've gotten some small bits of doubt from people in the sub in this thread. Some are blind I'm sure but I guess I just gotta hope that that's not the only people responding to this. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:32:07
Yeah it'd equal out to 0.0049 at this moment it's really all I have since I'm only 16 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:55:00
Eh that's not a risk I have to worry about it's cool to know though so thanks. Keep doing the bitcoin god's work.

It's just one of those refillable cards you can grab at Walmart. Also what's square app? I can't find it on the App Store. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:58:11
