Did the second episode release?? I have only seen the first episode and wasn't to thrilled. I actually fell asleep and had to start it over the next day. Maybe the second episode will be better??

That's shitty then. I have both episodes downloaded ready to watch. I guess I'll see how it is.

If coins are lost and never recovered they are gone for good. There is no way to recycle coins to account for lost ones. There will only ever be so many bitcoins made, so any lost ones will just lower the amount actually available in the market.

How do I add this to my home screen? I don't see anything in the options. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:45:44
I use BTC News for info and charts and stuff about coins. Has a live update feature too. Also check out Coinbits for more of the same thing. As far as wallets and stuff Blockchain is the only this close and idk if you can actually send/ buy coins with the app.

Damn. I reallllly wanted this option to work. It looks like they took this option off their site. I attached m bank info and went to make a transaction an pay with bank account isn't there! Wtf. It's always something with bit instant, can't ever get their shit together. 
Made support email but haven't heard anything yet. Surprise surprise

Used them today ash deposit at CVS. Coins in account and 2 emails before I got back to my car in the parking lot. Like 2 mins fast. Couldn't believe it 
@_date: 2013-06-23 02:36:42
I'm down for a couple BTC worth. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:46:32
Is this bad?
@_date: 2013-06-28 23:44:24
Good to know thanks. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:28:07
Got it thanks!
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:18:40
Holy shit this idea is genius. Fuck those expensive and somewhat shady imo money exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:04:29
If you don't mind me asking why are you not able to use cash? Maybe you should email the support. They got back to me within 24 hours.  
@_date: 2013-07-05 00:52:20
I used them twice this week. Coins within 40mins max. I got some today and had 2 emails And coins in wallet before I got back to my car at CVS...
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:35:54
Ok but If I buy today at today's BTC price and it takes a week to go through do I get the price for today? Or whenever they feel like processing the order? That's going to decide if I use them or not

The option bank account or funding is not available for me. I Even have my bank account linked to them.. An now I have 2 transactions pending that when I scan the Code say invalid zipmark QR..
@_date: 2013-06-29 03:05:00
I'm having trouble for some reason when I scan my code it says not a valid zipmark QR code...any ideas?

Aren't you trusting every service to transfer the money? As far as I could tell there isn't some kind of escrow service with the transfers. Then again I'm still learning how it all works. When you get coins from bit instant or coinbase or something, is there a system to guarantee you get the coins or if not get a refund built in? 
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:27:56
Nice! Thanks, cool webpage. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 00:04:04
That's odd. Not sure what to do. It gave me a few questions based on your  personal info. 
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:14:35
I have just started using coinbase. Will be placing my first oder tonight after work. I have heard good things but what makes it in your opinion? What are some of the thugs I can look forward to?
