1. Sure, this one (remittance) is quite personal. I know that I travel way more than the average consumer.
2. I didn't say "tanks", I said "next big crash". Or well, I could have said "tanking on a ~50 years timescale". That's not paranoia, that's History repeating. BTW, I live in Japan, where the JPY lost 30% of its value compared to the USD (which itself was loosing value) in 7 months last year. No one was scrounging for food and supplies, but everyone was complaining that gas was getting more expensive again, as well as fruits, vegetables, followed a few month later by meat, cheese, other foods, supplies, and then later, taxes, and more recently services, and basically everything. Then for the average consumer to perceive the value proposition of bitcoin, you only need to explain to them that increasing prices is a simple consequence of long-term inflation.
3. Sure, that doesn't seem to be an important part of the credit card culture, but that seems to be an important part of the bitcoin culture. That may be because that's a good way for merchants to incentivize consumers.

Each estimate I found on this thread was not taking into account some hint given by op which reduces the search space dramatically.
For example, u/Msuix and u/OverlordQ took a whole dictionary instead of the recent additions, u/cdm9002 is not taking into account that the length is 17, etc.

Thank you for a thoughtful response!
I agree that a 50% investment in a single venture would be foolish if that was 50% of my lifetime savings.
What I should have mentioned is that, I have a steady job, I'm still building my career, so most of my fiat savings are in my future. Moreover, I live in a country where your employer pays about twice the salary you actually get, because half of it goes to a pension fund (life insurance? I'm not sure of the right vocabulary). That means that even if I loose 100% of my daily savings, I can still retire comfortably.
To my knowledge, there is no better investment available today than bitcoin by far. Therefore it would be irrational not to invest a big chunk of what I can afford to loose. Since I can afford to loose 100%, I think 50% was actually pretty reasonable.

As the thread goes on, real questions and argumentation appear. Especially pages 4 and 5. Therefore there is still hope for these people to grasp a little bit about the power of bitcoin.


Please tell him to look at the history of the german Mark in the 1920's, or the Zimbabwe dollar in the 2000's, or at any of these [39 examples of hyperinflation in recent history](


That's a common misconception. The total value of all the gold held by governments+banks+investment funds in the world is less than $2 trillion. That's peanuts compared to the total value of currencies in the world. Furthermore, the latter number is rapidly growing compared to the first one.


This is a very good question, and brings up one of the most important strength of bitcoin. You never need to send your key, you sign a transaction locally (possibly on an offline device), and send a signed transaction. It is impossible to recover the key from the signed transaction.

Hello Patrick, congratulations on the nomination.
Despite the international potential of bitcoin, right now bitcoin is mostly american. And I feel bitcoin adoption is nearing saturation in the US for now (until it becomes grand-mother friendly), whereas it has much more potential for adoption in other countries (where even geeks have never heard about it). Here's my question.
Does the foundation have plans to improve bitcoin education abroad, either directly, or by encouraging and helping the formation of foundations in bitcoin-poor countries (like Japan, France, Italy, most of Africa and the middle-east, and maybe India) ?
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:29:19
But when BTC first spiked above $1000, the price was $800 on MtGox, while $1100 on btcChina.
See [this chart I made](
I don't see how this could be compatible with arbitrage. Buying for $1100 on btcChina to sell for $800 on MtGox is a pretty bad arbitrage strategy...
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:31:42
Sorry, I should have clarified that I'm talking about the first spike above $1000.
Indeed, the second spike was lead by MtGox. But the difference then was only 10%, compared to 30% for the first spike.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:30:23
Whatever this transaction is, why not send the coins by smaller increments like 1k for example? Is that paranoid to think that there is a possibility that you copy the receiving address, but when you paste it, it's an ever-so-slightly different address. For example, because of a virus, or because some bit changed because of some rare hardware or software error.

I think the Japanese government would be as much if not more likely to be the culprit here. Japan has an extremely strong stance on money laundering. For example, it has a system in place where the police can order to freeze ALL the bank accounts of an individual, effective within minutes from the order, and for many years even without trial, based on mere suspicion of money laundering. What constitutes a suspicion? For example if you have been selling a substantial amount of bitcoins on localbitcoins. Or so have I been told. And my favorite website is 9GAG.

Thank you for your comment! It makes a lot of sense and is well argued (that's refreshing).
Here's why I think we disagree. If GHash, as the majority pool, implemented this, I would recognize that as a great boost to bitcoin decentralization and hence security, and therefore the long-term value I attach to 1 BTC would significantly increase (by one order-of-magnitude or more). Then, I would put more of my savings into buying BTCs. I assume (for no good reason I'll admit) that many people see things as I do. Therefore, I believe that if GHash implemented a fee that gradually increases with their share, the value of BTC would go up significantly, say 10%.
Now assume they use the formula fee = 1%/[50%-x].
That means when their share is 0%, their fee is 0.02%. When their share is 40%, their fee is 0.1%. 48% =&gt; 0.5%, 49% =&gt; 1%, 49.9% =&gt; 10%, 50% =&gt; they disable mining until someone else solves the next block.
Since the fee at 48% is still smaller than most pools, they should easily get 48%, without the value of BTC suffering. That strategy maximizes their profit (with maybe some other numbers, don't quote me), both in the short term and in the long term.
But I guess you don't make the same assumption as me, that the price of BTC is sensitive to the share of the biggest pool. Then what you say makes perfect sense.
Some minor points follow.
You wrote "ever decreasing fee formula", but I assumed you meant "ever increasing fee formula"
I am well aware that even 20% is dangerous. 50% is an important threshold though, and the first step would be to avoid it.
As for the last and most important part in your post, I fully agree.

Now that's a great way to drive bitcoin adoption! That gives bitcoin an additional property: the property of reward points. People do use point cards, because they don't want to let these points go to waste (even though they are usually 0.1% to 1% of their purchase).
And then of course, once they try it, they adopt it. I think I don't even need to argue this.

If you think the second one (fear of crash or rather one of its consequences, strong inflation) is from an investor speculator point-of-view, then I guess you would qualify of investor/speculator anyone who is saving money and thinking a little bit where to put it (gold? real estate? stocks? bitcoins?). This definition includes most consumers in developed countries.
For the third one (merchants passing savings), we also agree. This has not been widely, but significantly adopted. What I propose is that this yields a significant value proposition.

Of course my personal analysis is meaningless. Each investor has a personal estimate of the long-term price, which may be $100, $500, $1000, $2000, $10k, $100k, $1M, whatever. My point is, if your number is anything above $1000, it's a very bad idea to be too greedy and wait for the price to drop just a little bit more... just a little bit more... just a lit... shit!
I mentioned $100k just to make my post clearer. I could have said "its natural course to a value significantly larger than $1000". About the $100k figure, though, let me put here the words of Bill Miller, one of the most prominent investors in the world, "Gold alone has an $8 trillion market value, bitcoin has about a $7 billion market value, so if it’s only 10 percent as successful as gold you get 100 times your money.”
I have no training in financial analysis. But if the history of the price of BTC is any indication of its future, in a few months half of the posts on this subreddit will be people whining about why then didn't buy when it was still below $1000. All the while I'll be holding until I can use it to buy stuff in my country, which has a 127 million, almost completely untapped potential userbase (Japan).

The success of any market relies on the assumption of rational and knowledgeable actors. With the knowledge that the value of BTC goes down significantly when a pool approaches 50% (this was obvious to me from the start), any rational company is expected to limit their growth in order to maximize profits.

Imagine you had an altercation with some authorities, and you were not sure how to proceed (sue? shut up?).
Would you post your whole story with all details with your main account (knowing that anything you write can be used against you if you go to trial), or would you post, with a throwaway account, a story that vaguely resemble your experience but with some details edited (so that the post can not be associated to you)?
Some time ago I had a bad experience (other kind) with some authorities, wanted some feedback from the reddit community, and posted an edited story (main story unchanged, details changed) with a throwaway account. Half of the posts were about how my story was bullshit...
The other half were very helpful though, so thank you reddit!

Also let's not forget that when the reward goes down, the incentive goes down, so the mining difficulty goes down, so it costs less to stabilize the network, so the mining network will always be in equilibrium whatever the (non-zero) reward.

A useful reminder.
As a caveat though, that is true only if you mine bitcoins. If you buy bitcoins with fiat, someone else sold them. That means that the fiat will eventually be used somewhere to support the policies of some country. In other words you are giving someone else your voting power.
That's still a good thing if you think the policies in your country are worse than in most countries where bitcoins are mined.

Sorry, but I'd rather not share my code for several reasons:
1. If I publish my code, there will be thousands of people running it constantly to try and bruteforce brainwallets of random victims.
2. I have no formal education in computing, so everything I do is dirty. You'd better learn from someone who knows the standards.
Anyway, this is not difficult at all. I use Dropbox to communicate between the PCs. Each slave CPU is assigned a unique number. When CPU number 13 finishes its work, it writes a file "nextplease.13". The master sees the file even if it is on an other PC because it is synchronized automatically by Dropbox. The master deletes the file, and writes the number 378 in a file "hereyougo.13". CPU  reads the file, deletes it, and start trying every combination with word  as the first word. The next time master CPU sees a nextplease.xxx, it writes the number 379 in "hereyougo.xxx".

In hyper-paranoid mode, I would say that your private key is still somewhere in the memory of your old computer.

Each PC has the same, whole set of words.
Each core communicate with a master core, which distributes the load. From the point of view of one slave core, it gets assigned one word, and tries every combinations with that given word as the first of the 3 words. When it is done, it requests the next available word to the master.
Of course this is far from optimal, but here the parallelization is not limiting at all. By working 20 more minutes on the parallelization, I could have reduced the total time of the computation by, maybe, 20 minutes...

An important paper was published this week: "Enabling Blockchain Innovations with Pegged Sidechains", by Adam Back, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr,. Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Miller, Andrew Poelstra, Jorge Timón, and Pieter Wuille.
If you’ve followed Bitcoin for any time, you’ll know this is a seriously eminent group of authors
It describes a way to build “pegged sidechains”. Sidechains themselves are not new – the idea, and how to build them, has been discussed for some time and the key breakthrough was outlined earlier in the year. But this paper gives more detail on the concept and has attracted a lot of comment.
But what are they? And why should anybody care?
**A mental model for Bitcoin**
The key to understanding most innovations in the Bitcoin space is to make sure you have the right mental model for how Bitcoin itself works. It turns out that most people I speak to don’t really understand how it works and, as a result, have a faulty mental model.
To help with this, I’ll net it down to the basics.
First, clear your head of the word ledger. The mind-bending secret of Bitcoin is that there actually isn’t a ledger! The only data structures that matter are transactions and blocks of transactions. And it’s important to get this clear in your head if sidechains are going to make sense.
When you “move” Bitcoins, what you’re saying is:
Hello everybody… I’d like to move these specific Bitcoins, please.
Here is the proof that I am entitled to move them
And here is how the recipient will, in turn, prove that they are entitled to move them.
There are several important points here:
* Bitcoins are not perfectly fungible… when you move (or spend) them, you’re spending some specific bitcoins
* In order to spend them, you have to prove you’re entitled to do so. And you do that by providing the solution to a challenge that was laid down when they were sent to you in the first place. This challenge is usually just: “prove to the world that you know the public key that corresponds to a particular Bitcoin address and are in possession of the corresponding private key”. But it can be more sophisticated than that.
* When you send Bitcoins somewhere, you lay down the challenge for the next owner. Usually, you’ll simply specify that they need to know the public and private keypair that correspond to the Bitcoin address the coins were sent to. But it can be more complicated than that. In the general case, you don’t even know who the next owner is… it’s just whoever can satisfy the condition.
Fine. So the “grammar” of a Bitcoin transaction is clear:   “Here are the coins I want to move, here’s the proof I’m entitled to and here’s what the recipient must do, in turn, if they want to spend them”.
This three-part structure to a Bitcoin transaction works well and it turns out that you can do some really interesting things with it.   For example, you can use the “not-entirely fungible” feature to “tag” coins. This is the basis of the “Colored Coins” and “Smart Property” worlds.
But there are problems, such as:
**Block interval**
**Transaction Structure**
The “three-part” transaction structure is very general but it only allows you to transfer ownership of Bitcoins. Some people would like to transmit richer forms of information across these sorts of systems.
**Transaction Transfer Conditions**
I said above that you can build sophisticated rules into Bitcoin transactions to specify how ownership is proved. However, the Bitcoin scripting language is deliberately limited.
**One-size-fits-all security model**
It doesn’t matter if you’re moving $1bn or 0.01c across the Bitcoin network, you get the same security guarantees. And you pay for this in fees and time. What if you were prepared to trade safety for speed?
**One-size fits all doesn’t help if the size doesn’t fit you!**
Now, making experimental or rapid changes to Bitcoin is very risky and so change happens slowly. So if the one-size-fits-all architecture of Bitcoin doesn’t suit a particular use-case, you have a problem.
It creates risk and fragmentation and slows the build-out of products, services and infrastructure.
**Centralised Wallet Providers as a “poor-man’s sidechain”?**
But there’s an interesting observation we can make. Think about what happens if you send Bitcoins to a centralized wallet such as circle.com for safekeeping.
You send your coins to a particular Bitcoin address
They appear inside your circle wallet and are out of your control on the blockchain.
At some point in the future, you might send your coins back out of your circle wallet to a Bitcoin address you own
You now have control of some coins on the Bitcoin blockchain again!
From the perspective of the Bitcoin network, Circle is a black box.   You had some coins… you sent them to a specific address…   some stuff happened that Bitcoin couldn’t see…. And at some point later, you had control of some coins again.   It’s as if those coins had been moved from Bitcoin to somewhere else and then back again.
**Here’s the Sidechains insight**
The key idea behind the sidechains concept is:
What if you could send Bitcoins not only to individuals, addresses and centralized services but to other blockchains?
Imagine there is a Bitcoin-like system out there that you’d like to use. Perhaps it’s litecoin or ethereum or perhaps it’s something brand new.   Maybe it has a faster block confirmation interval and a richer scripting language. It doesn’t matter.   The point is: you’d like to use it but would rather not have to go through the risk and effort of buying the native tokens for that platform. You have Bitcoins already. Why can’t you use them?
**The sidechains ideas is this:**
* Send your Bitcoins to a specially formed Bitcoin address. The address is specially designed so that the coins will now be out of your control… and out of the control of anybody else either. They’re completely immobilized and can only be unlocked if somebody can prove they’re no longer being used elsewhere (I’ll explain what I mean by this in a minute).   In other words, you’ve used the core bitcoin transaction rules I described above to lay down a specific condition that the future owner – whoever it ends up being – needs to fulfil in order to take control
* Once this immobilisation transaction is sufficiently confirmed, you send a message to the other blockchain – the one you were wanting to use. This message contains a proof that the coins were sent to that special address on the Bitcoin network, that they are therefore now immobilized and, crucially, that you were the one who did it
* If the second blockchain has agreed to be a Bitcoin sidechain, it now does something really special… it creates the exact same number of tokens on its own network and gives you control of them.
* So it’s as if your Bitcoins have been transferred to this second chain. And remember: they’re immobilized on the Bitcoin network… so we haven’t created or destroyed any…. Just “moved” them.
* You can now transact with those coins on that second chain, under whatever rules that chain chooses to implement.
* Perhaps blocks are created faster on that sidechain. Perhaps transaction scripts are “turing complete”. Perhaps you have to pay fees to incent those securing that sidechain. Who knows. The rules can be whatever those running that sidechain want them to be. The only rule that matters is that the sidechain agrees to follow the convention that if you can prove you put some Bitcoins out of reach on the Bitcoin network, the same number will pop into existence on the sidechain.
* And now for the second clever part. The logic above is symmetric. So, at any point, whoever is holding these coins on the sidechain can send them back to the Bitcoin network by creating a special transaction on the sidechain that immobilises the bitcoins on the sidechain. They’ll disappear from the sidechain and become available again on the Bitcoin network, under the control of whoever last owned them on the sidechain.
So, to repeat, we’ve used standard Bitcoin transaction functionality to move coins out of reach and we then prove to a second, unrelated chain, that we’ve done this.  And when we’re done, whoever owns them on the sidechain can do the same thing and send them back to the bitcoin network.
So developers get the opportunity to experiment with different types of cryptocurrency rules without needing to create their own currency.
**And it now becomes possible to do some very interesting things in the Bitcoin space.**
Step back from the details for moment and consider what’s been described.  We now have a way to move coins from Bitcoin onto another platform (a sidechain) and move them back again.   That’s pretty much what we do when we move them to a wallet platform or an exchange.  The difference is that the “platform” they’ve been moved to is also a blockchain… so it has the possibility of decentralised security, visibility and to gain from other innovation in this space.
For example, one could imagine a sidechain that is “mined” only by one company. That would be identical to a single-company wallet, but with full visibility of transactions.
Going further, you could imagine a sidechain that is mined by 100 different companies in a loose federation. Not totally decentralized, but harder to censor or subvert than if it were just one.
And there are lots of other possibilities. The key is that you can build these experiments and products and services without also needing to create a new currency or fall back into the old centralised style.
So when I look at sidechains, I’m looking at them as an architecture for building semi-decentralised products and services for Bitcoin that were simply impossible before.
Now there are some serious issues with the scheme. Peter Todd has raised doubts about how secure it might be and it might require a one-off change to Bitcoin.
But it’s early days.  I’m looking forward to watching this space develop

I think he meant in the very long term, when bitcoin is really mainstream with 80% people using it, the price will probably overshoot once before stabilizing to its long-term value. This is probably true.
But the way he said it was confusing, and on an even longer timescale, the value of bitcoin will keep on slowly increasing because of fiat inflation and private key losses.

I think this is a common misconception. I have similar beliefs (my long-term number is not $1m, but $100k), but I didn't sink all my money into btc, only half of it. Why? Because I still need to provide for my family until we can live solely on my BTCs, which should be in about 2-3 years, and I still need a reserve fund in case of emergency (hospitalization? unemployment?)

Some time ago I had a bad experience (other kind) with some authorities, wanted some feedback from the reddit community, and posted an edited story (main story unchanged, details changed) with a throwaway account. Half of the posts were about how my story was bullshit...

I bought at 1000. I'll be holding until I can use it to buy stuff in my country, which has a 127 million, almost completely untapped potential userbase (Japan).
I still think this was a clever investment, in a decade timeframe. I could have waited for better luck and get 2 times more BTCs for my fiat, but the price could have continued its natural course to $100k (personal analysis) without me.
If you are waiting for the price to come down a little bit more, you are really playing with fire. If the history of the price of BTC is any indication of its future, in a few months half of the posts on this subreddit will be people whining about why then didn't buy when it was still below $1000.

Did they already reach 50% in January? I was busy at that time, not following the news. Did the price react?
As for the last few days, we should look at a graph of price vs GHASH.IO share. It seemed to me that the price drop and subsequent recovery was very well correlated with GHASH.IO&gt;50% and then GHASH.IO&lt;40%.
As for the fundamental problem with the bitcoin protocol, I agree and would like to see a patch (several proposals really do make sense. I really like the non-outsourceable puzzle). Actually I have always been a proponent of PoS like NXT or NAS or hybrid PoW/PoS. Mining really is decentralized: anyone can mine with an old laptop, now and forever.

For bitcoin to reach these goals, it needs to be used in mass. The diseases you mention won't disappear if only 2 million people (=0.02%=peanuts) are vaccined.

Here's a very conservative estimate. If you think there is a 50/50 chance to go back to 500 before going up to 1000, your statistically expected gain from buying now is (0.5*(500-700)+0.5*(1000-700)) = 50$ per bitcoin.
I personally think there is a 50/50 chance to go back to 500 before going up to 10000, so I estimate the expected gain at 4550$ per bitcoin.

In one sentence: the bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts itself so that the mining ecosystem is always at a self-organized equilibrium. This is why it is sustainable.
Now if you don't get that, here's roughly what I mean:
Say there are 3 entities who can mine bitcoin with different costs (because of slight differences in hardware, energy cost, etc.). Entity A can mine with 103% ROI, entity B with 102% ROI, and entity C with 101% ROI. So obviously, they all mine.
But let's say today the price of bitcoin drops by 3%. Then the ROI for C becomes roughly 98%, in other words, they mine at a loss. So they stop mining. What about B? Is their ROI now 99%? Well no! Because C is out of the race, the difficulty dropped, so their ROI actually went up! (I simplified for the sake of discussion. Actually C would not stop mining, they would mine with 90% of their equipment so that the drop in difficulty brings their ROI back to 100+epsilon%, or they would just continue mining betting that the price goes up again later)
And there is now even more incentive for D and E to develop better hardware than C to enter the race.

I think the Japanese government would be as much if not more likely to be the culprit here. Japan has an extremely strong stance on money laundering. For example, it has a system in place where the police can order to freeze ALL the bank accounts of an individual, effective within minutes from the order, and for many years even without trial, based on mere suspicion of money laundering. What constitutes a suspicion? For example if you have been selling a substantial amount of bitcoins on localbitcoins. Or so have I been told. And my favorite website is 9GAG.

Based on the [estimated transaction volume]( the largest spike that followed negative news corresponds to about 3 millions BTC.
Assuming that the whole volume is people selling different (unique) bitcoins, which goes strongly in the direction of your argument, that's 25% of the total number of existing bitcoins. So the vast majority is just HODLING.

Not all bitcoiners are anarchists. The bitcoin protocol itself is a regulation. Granted, these rules are self-imposed, but if bitcoin one day becomes the standard, these rules will be imposed to some extent (if you don't want to go through endless troubles with fiat, you have to obey our rules).
Personally, I think regulation is good, at least in theory, when it is simple, general (not "All car companies with a name starting with TES and ending in LA are forbidden to sell cars"), aligned with the greater good as derived from careful scientific studies (plural is key), and followed by everyone. In practice though, one or several of these principles are broken by people in power who manage to selfishly profit from their own crafted regulation.

Thank you for your constructive answer!
I agree that this theory (which resembles free-market btw in this case, since most posters here have all the incentives to improve the bitcoin ecosystem) has strong flaws when you apply it to the real world, like any theory.
But the other theory whereby moderators know what's best for us naive sheeps, and can act as protective parents, appears to me to have flaws that are even more dangerous, applied to the real world.
Anyway, I guess the best solution is to diversify your sources of information. Easier said than done though.
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:41:27
This is not an attitude. I have reasons to buy the movie and the special, and reasons not too, and paying in bitcoin would definitely bring the balance to the "buy it!" side. Something else like a good review from a friend might do the trick too. That is all.
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:18:28
And now my answer:
I care about this because bitcoin relies on a system of incentives, which can only work if most agents are mostly rationals. And for agents to be rational, they need to be well-informed. If information in the bitcoin community is sequestered into compartments with very different flavors, the community is bound to be split and the agents are bound to be ill-informed.


That is not my issue. I surely hope that different people have different opinions and different goals. And I do not want people to stop arguing against each others.
The issue is when one is exposed to only one side of argument, which shapes one's opinion, even though one would have reached a different conclusion if only one would have been exposed to the arguments of several "teams".
Therefore, I want to decentralize the discussions.


Now, that is exactly the problem! To have a constructive thinking process, you have to explore a bit away from your comfort zone.
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:40:24
Oh, I see how my comment sounds dickish. But I didn't mean it at all as an ultimatum (My email is only the quoted part. I didn't send any ultimatum.)

It took Dell 14 days. What makes you think it would take Rakuten much longer? Is it because of the wording of their announcement?

And now my answer:
I think many r/bitcoin people know that r/btc exists, but when you look at the frontpage of r/btc, ALL posts are related to only two topics: BU vs segwit, or r/btc vs r/bitcoin.
This is unlike r/bitcoin, where, you could argue, MOST posts are also related to the same two topics, but at least there is a bit more diversity in the topics.
Therefore, I think we have to improve the quality of r/btc before we can expect most r/bitcoin people (most of the bitcoin community) to join r/btc.

An answer from davis196 on bitcointalk:
Why do you care about this?
I don't read bitcoin related subreddits and i don't use reddit.
People have different opinions and diffrerent goals and this is normal.
I can't see how this "copy-paste your posts" thing will stop people from arguing against each other.
If you have a problem with this,just don't read bitcoin subreddit posts.

I don't get that at all. Why wouldn't the market adjusts itself like it always did? Now successfull mining is performed by people with access to cheap electricity, electronics and labor. If the block gets bigger, successfull mining will be performed by people with access to strong internet connection. I mean, for any entity who quits mining, there will be another entity who will start mining, because of the subsequent drop in difficulty.

Congrats! I'm so jelly though. I first heard the word "bitcoin" in 2013. Then spent one week reading about it, and one month later I bought specialized hardware to mine it. But I was able to mine only about 0.3 BTC in total.
I wish I found racism funny!

Yes and they are doing it right, here's why :
\- If you want to make a long-term investment, cost-averaging is a good way. I suppose you know why. Then of course the lower the price, the more you want to buy.
\- But if your job is to trade, then buying when you thing the price is low is a very bad idea. For example, let's say you have a capital of $100k, and you looked at the price of BTC sky-rocketing to 20k. Then, without any major bad news in the crypto-space, the price decreases to 13k. You have good reasons to think that's a low, so you invest $25k to buy bitcoin. Then the price decreases to 10k. You invest $25k more because this time that's the lowest low. Then the price decreases to 7k. You invest $25k more. Then price 5k, you invest the remaining of your capital because how could it ever go lower. Too bad the price goes to 3k and you have to wait about a year before getting even, two years to start making profits. Meanwhile, you could have made a ton of money with your initial capital, if you had just followed the macro-trend (that's an over-simplification, representative of technical analysis). Price falls from 20k to 17k? Macro-trend seems bearish... But let's wait and confirm. Price falls from 17k to 13k? Bearish macro-trend confirmed. Short BTC. 13k to 10k? Really bearish, short some more. 10k to 5k? No reason for trend to reverse. 5k to 3k? How low can it go? Noone knows. Price going sideways? Time to be cautious... 3k to 5k? Seems like a macro-trend reversal, but who knows. Let's wait and confirm. 5k to 7k? OK bullish macro-trend confirmed. Take profit on shorts (you successfully shorted from 13k to 7k - only with shear luck could you have shorted from 20k to 3k), and start longing BTC. etc... etc... So you see: when you trade, it makes more sense to buy when the price is high(-er than before), and sell when the price is low(-er than before).

Perception can change. France went from old francs to new francs (100 old francs = 1 new franc) and then to euros (1 euro = 6.56 francs). Each time, people got used to it in a few months. Everyone knows the price of a croissant is 95 cents in euro, even though that was 5 francs before, and 500 francs before that.

This is absolutely key! Right now with bitcoin, arrogance is extremely dangerous. You need to spend at least a few dozen hours studying computer security and bitcoin security, or buy a Trezor, or invest via a regulated ETF, or else wait a few years for more layers of simplifying technologies before investing heavily into bitcoin.

The danger with the latter is that many people would remember 1BTC=$100 in 2013, look again in 2014 and see 1BTC=$10 and think it went down and thus is a bad investment, not knowing the thousand-fold split.

@_date: 2013-12-11 09:37:20
The best way to trigger an aha moment for a friend is to make him an address and send a few mBTC in there.
That should take no more than 2 minutes, and you get to see your friend's amazement:
"That's it? I now have some bitcoins?"
To each his method but what I do is create a brain wallet on bitaddress.org with a sentence of their choice.
Of course then I explain that it's not secure enough for more than a few mBTC. But don't try to explain everything at first.
