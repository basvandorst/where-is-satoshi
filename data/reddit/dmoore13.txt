Protect yourself **and** save yourself the huge headache of having to figure out how to manage this shit by buying a few gold/silver coins and a mining mutual fund...

Dat gold tho.

On a related note, my precious metals mining stocks are doing awesome!
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:50:44
Specific heat capacity, specific thermal conductivity, specific electrical conductivity, unique melting point, unique boiling point, non-reactive...
But yes... it also does make a nice looking spoon.

Gold has never hit zero ever - not once - and never will until society itself collapses or until we get nuclear fusion going for free. This is primarily because of the "intrinsic value" that results from its specific physical properties.
One or more crypto-currencies almost certainly will hit zero at some point - maybe not bitcoin, but given how many of them there are, one of them will (probably some already have). As soon as a crypto-currency falls out of favour as a currency, it's done.
In that sense, intrinsic value does mean something. I'm not saying I hate bitcoin and don't want it to succeed. I don't mind if it does. But I think you are showing your fanboy colours while making the argument that intrinsic value is meaningless.
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:19:20
I'm just explaining what intrinsic value is - obviously the people who buy it for investment or as an inflation hedge aren't looking to use it in an industrial process as a material, but they are looking to those properties as a reason why the metal can't ever go to 0. The cheaper it gets, the more people who do have a use for it as a material, which gives buoyancy to the price.
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:25:59
Be honest with yourself. No way this is real. Why on earth would a government agent say that?
This is written as jerk-off material for the most fervent bitcoin fans (you know, the ones who behave like you've insulted their wife if you mention that the price may continue to decline), and only they will be fooled by the uncalled for lengthy glowing review Bond gives in that passage.

It has only hit that price once ever (in what was now considered a bubble). And who's to say that some other cryptocurrency won't become the primary vehicle for remittances before Bitcoin ever hits that price again?
No offense, but I think that's a pretty horrible algorithm for determining "normal price".

And how exactly did he insult the "users" of bitcoin. Just by suggesting that the price might continue to go down? That doesn't address *users*, it addresses *investors*, and it may not even be an "insult" at all, just a prediction.


No I'm not.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:26:46
In less than two weeks this will no longer be true.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:50:52
On "intrinsic value" and gold.
Gold is an element.
It has a melting point and a boiling point.
It has a specific heat capacity.
It has a unique electrical conductivity and a thermal conductivity.
It has a specific atomic mass and density.
It has many other unique properties - some are easily replicated with other materials and alloys, others are not.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:06:55
On its own, sure, but combined with that list? You know, that list of traits people usually use for what makes good money or what makes a good long-term store of value?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:42:45
Yes, but nobody is suggesting air as an obvious, tangible currency.
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:03:02
I understand. It's easier to assume that someone you disagree with doesn't actually hold that opinion than it is to refute it.
Refute it by, say in this case, actually putting up the evidence that Schiff did insult all users rather than simply saying that in his opinion, investors are going to lose their money.
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:58:39
Because expressing doubts that a specific currency will catch on long-term is equivalent to 'insulting your customer base'. It's a currency - it's not your wife...
Remember, not everybody who has a few bitcoins is as irrationally and fanatically devoted to the current flagship crypto-currency as some of the people in this echo chamber. Some people are just interested in new technologies and are playing around and trying things out.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:43:33
I can't really tell you that. I'm only one out of 7 billion people in the global market. Depends on who needs it for any of those properties (plus the properties I didn't list) and why (i.e. the need that defines the ceiling they are willing to pay), and who's providing it - in short, the supply and demand.
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:29:09


Speculation that the world's central banks would continue to devalue their currencies, no?


How indeed.


Those things expire a at some point and generally do not have the same value and rarity packed into such a small volume. Even at $200/oz, gold has a much higher value to weight or value to volume ratio than alcohol or cigs. (not saying that alcohol isn't a good investment or that it isn't also a good thing to keep stored in significant quantity)

Ok... still. Don't worry about it at all yet. I mean.. you're going to spend a couple of hours figuring out what's your best investment to make $100 into $105?

Did I write "investment" or "buy"?
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:52:23
Anybody want to tell me again that Gold, Silver, Platinum, or Palladium is a worse buy than Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:28:52


@_date: 2015-01-18 19:15:35
Ok, so you're arguing almost completely the opposite of the OP - that copper and bitcoin are largely not worth assets, but gold is. I take your point. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:59:42


That doesn't mean much. Bitcoin is still largely unused by the vast majority of the population. An alt could rocket past bitcoin for any unforeseen reason that caused it to capture the interest of even 1% of the population.


That's the only reason anyone needs to not carry a float long-term at all.
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:22:40
Metals are materials. They can be moulded and shaped into things and therefore have a functional value. They can never go to zero. You're really drinking the kool-aid if you think gold could go to zero.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:44:52


I've got some bad news...
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:06:18
Basically everyone who responded to me in this sub any time I mentioned the word "gold" over the past year.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:59:02
Could someone enlighten me on this please? For all of 2013 I heard that one of Bitcoin's main selling points was that its limited supply allows it to hold its value. Now all I hear is that price doesn't matter. Which is it and why is the other argument wrong  or meaningless?
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:20:36


But isn't one of the whole points of the currency to limit the supply so that it retains value, or gradually grows in value as the economy grows and fiat value shrinks? The list of "why bitcoin is better" always includes the money size limit near the top..
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:29:31




Oh yeah. Totally. If you only have a hundred dollars all you should be doing is looking for a job or to upgrade your current job somehow. I was taking that as a given.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:25:05
Can you blame them? Over the past year, the "haters" came here and tried their best to save Bitcoiners from themselves, and the most fervent coiners who angrily rebuked them with a myriad of arguments that apparently didn't hold water are now the only ones left in here. This is gourmet 'I told you so' schadenfreude.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:54:51
I think I heard that about a year ago.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:41:09
Ignoring comparative downside? None of those metals can possibly go to zero. Bitcoin could easily be replaced by another crypto at this point, if for no other reason than just to get away from the stigma.

You can. It depends on your reasons for it. You're right about different purposes.


So you're not one of the 99% in this subreddit who is very worried about fiat inflation?
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:13:59


Yes, but that is the case directly *because* it is so rare and already has a material value. Think about it - if gold was approximately as abundant as copper, it would likely have a price more similar to copper, and would be used for more industrial/material purposes like copper is. My point is, gold could lose all of its "monetary value" and would still have to carry a higher price than copper.
If we were drawing a spectrum of "worthy" assets, I'd have to go USD &lt; bitcoin &lt; copper &lt; gold.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:58:22
Dead cat bounce?
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:12:05
Right. Not zero.
What price would you expect bitcoin to go to if everyone decided to quit using it as money (perhaps in favour of an alternative cryptocurrency that was considered better for whatever reason)?
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:49:15
So you don't "fully expect Bitcoin to drive the price of gold to zero".


How about silver's, platinum's, and palladium's?
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:14:39
Depends. Does the question apply to you?
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:26:33
Why cheer a number you were miserable about 3 weeks ago?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:35:58


I'd like to think I'm open-minded enough to be either given the right situation, but I don't see why I should have wanted to buy into a bursting bubble over the past year for social value. I wouldn't mind if bitcoin did gain wider adoption purely for some of the reasons of taking some power away from some governments and central banks, but I'm not going to risk 5-80% of net worth or anything like half of the irrationally exuberant in here.


On this front, I can't easily distinguish bitcoin from any other crypto, including ones that are maybe superior to bitcoin but haven't been invented yet.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:38:10
Gold, silver, platinum and palladium have tonnes of uses with respect to their rarity. They are materials - elements, each with specific physical properties.
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:33:30
Did you ever, at any point, consider putting like $100k into mutual funds or something so you'd never again have to be shitting your pants because you just had a fight with some Lumbergh boss?

Anything's possible.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:23:18
Considering that the majority of investors have bought in over the past year, a very high percentage of those who have *ever sold* (or used BTC to make a purchase) have taken a loss.
Why is the timeframe with the most activity considered arbitrary?
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:48:03
So indeed, you could take any timeframe where someone bought at the beginning and sold at the end and then declare that thing a good or a bad investment based on that timeframe.
However, anybody want to talk about wasted time figuring out how to set up your 'wallet' and figure out what's the most secure way not to get your cash stolen only to ride the wave buying in at $200 in Nov 2013 and then selling now at $200? Or any other timeframe except for the few sharp upswings?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:29:22
Nothing wrong with a diverse portfolio. I buy mutual funds, gold, silver, and pay off my house. My bank account float is CAD.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:06:45
Do you guys really not see that gold has WAY more in common with copper than bitcoin does?
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:38:38
Those are dollar signs on that receipt.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:01:33
It's not a precious metal - nobody's going to be able to make a necklace or an electronic part out of it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:15:31


Yeah, so what if some group has a reason to adopt it? There could be thousands of reasons including laws that short-sightedly target bitcoin when they should have targeted all cryptos. Maybe some black market economy in Russia or Venezuela needs to use a crypto and decides on something other than bitcoin because of bitcoin's current negative trend. Your lack of imagination is not my argument's problem.


Provided they can check their pride and pull their heads out of the sand, which I have seen very little evidence of judging by this sub.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:10:42
No, but a few people who were once enthusiastic probably just sold at a loss.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:18:27
Has nobody in here heard of mutual funds?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:42:29


You can digitize gold fairly easily. There are international banks that will allow you gold-linked debit cards.
All of those metals are relatively easy to store and move in high values because of their high price vs volume and weight. Yes, they still have a physical presence because they are an actual elemental material, but that keeps them from going to zero.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:47:43


Not compared to its value. Something has to have no weight at all to have trade value?


I take some on a plane every time I fly. I have it in my wallet and it's the size of my other change! It's also worth a few hundred. Also, you're assuming you can't digitize gold, which you can. There are banks I trust about as much as you guys trust bitstamp, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:55:55


If this is your primary reason, please do yourself a favour and at least buy some precious metals too.
