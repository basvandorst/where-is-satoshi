Miners are free to choose which transactions to add to blocks.

The question i ask in my post is how to prevent replay attacks in case of a hard fork.
You don't have to write here telling me that you know how to do it but doesn't want to tell me.

This is extremely bad, the guys making their hard fork needs to make some change in their fork so normal bitcoin transactions are not valid on their unlimited chain.
If their hard fork happens without this and users want coins from both chains it means every exchange, wallet provider and user will have to stop making transactions and implement a replay attack fix in their software? Mycelium, Electrum, Coinbase, Bitfinex, Okcoin, Gemini, Bitstamp and so on all needs to implement some way so that their transactions are only valid on one specific chain? Are we sure it's even possible to prevent replay attacks without doing another hard fork? Both chains are exactly the same. If it's possible to do, this will take very long time to implement, bug test and roll out and then all users needs to upgrade their wallets too, this will take weeks.
What the fuck are they doing?! Unlimited seems to be incredibly reckless, how can people be following them?
How would the message you are talking about look like in the Bitcoin Core log file? I would like to see the exact message in the source code.
If we have two chains everyone suddenly have double amount of coins, in some way it's going to be 42 million instead of 21 million coins. I'm pretty sure they are here to destroy Bitcoin and pump alt coins, then they have some stupid followers that can't think themselves and just follow their shit talk and FUD.
We need consensus before doing a hard fork, and it needs to be a safe hard fork, evil hard fork or call it whatever you want. Please don't destroy what we have.

Unlimited have already proved that they can (intentionally or accidentally) hard fork at any time.

Both coins will have value, look at Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, so i will want to sell the coins of one of the chains and keep the others.
Please describe for me exactly how I make transactions that can not be broadcasted on the other chain?

You made it sound like it's very easy to create transactions that can only be broadcasted on one chain so I though you where an expert and would know how to actually do it, I apologize for being wrong.
Many exchanges answer they will support both chains, so there will probably be a market for both coins just like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, that's where I would sell one of the coins.

I don't understand either, is it not possible to buy more than 100 million? Sounds stupid.
Isn't the point that they will buy the coins from a exchange (Gemini?) for every purchase of the ETF and store it in cold storage? So what's the meaning of having a limit of 100 million?

The way I understand Schnorr it would solve that, all those inputs can be made into one signature instead saving a lot of space. We need segwit first to get Schnorr signatures.

There is a Gold ETF, but gold can't be regulated, gold can't be surveilled similar to bitcoin. I can buy gold for cash and sell it for cash to anyone. The difference I see is that most gold trade that happens is regulated and SEC reason to deny bitcoin etf was that most bitcoin trading and price discovery is done on unregulated exchanges with suspect price manipulation happening on them.
SEC obviously told this to Winks early and they did all they could do trying to fix this issue, launching their own regulated exchange and also the daily auction for price discovery. It's sad it was not enough and that they didn't get enough volume compared to the unregulated exchanges.
The Chinese exchanges which had 98% of volume are getting regulated right now by PBoC I believe to combat price manipulation etc, so I believe ETF can happen but not yet.
It's also possible the regulation on bitfinex and bitstamp does not stop price manipulation sufficiently according to SEC. They only have KYC etc, afaik there is no law against traders trying to do price manipulation in bitcoin markets?

He followed the rule of the contract, so he is not a thief and we should not call him a thief at all.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:18:05
You are calling the person a thief, thieving is a crime.
