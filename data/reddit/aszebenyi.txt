You're the perfect example of a scammer dude, you go around making up lies to try and change sentiment in other subs and possible influence people into making decisions they didn't want to make, you're a perfect example of a conman, you've been called out multiple times. I can't believe you're here on you're high horse preaching about scammers.
You are what's wrong in crypto. You're toxic.

A Bitcoin shop should have cold wallets for sale, prepaid Bitcoin gift cards, atm machines, crypto/blockchain books, maybe some mining equipment, help centre. No shirts or cheap China trinkets.

Venezuelan people have been using the US dollar for over a decade. I remember paying in dollars and getting change back in bolivars over 15 years ago.

Most people there got rekt in the 2017 bearmarket and hang out there now.
Also a lot of traders that lost a shit ton of money.
A lot of wallsteetbet guys in there too.
Some people just missed out and WANT it to be a scam.
I go in there to keep my feet on the ground sometimes but it’s easy to see who is bitter and who is looking for another perspective.
There’s a difference between criticism and ridicule.

When and who did they scam? What did they take and how much?
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:56:55
He shilled known scams, he pushed ref links to dangerous leverage trading, he promotes unregulated exchanges, he shill coins without mentioning they are paid ads. He can pretend he is a victim but he is shady.

You seem very bitter dude
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:21:07
