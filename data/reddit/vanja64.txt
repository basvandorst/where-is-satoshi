Wait for Amazon to start accepting cryptos 
Or if they chose to stay out of it, some other company that is lurking behind will. 
Than you spend it without any restrictions

The amount of gold ever mined is worth $7.5 trillion aprox. Where the amount BTC ever mined is worth $71 billion aprox. 
So roughly 100x is gold more worth   
There is a huge room for BTC to improve. 
If BTC survives next 10 and so years it can only go upwards and people like us, internet generation, will be more likely to store values on, guess where?
I would say, in 20 years, overall stored wealth will be split between gold and whatever crypto-storable entity. 
If it is not BTC it will be next generation of it.

I don't think this is unrealistic 
Although I don't think it'll grow on account of gold. Gold will remain major reserve asset in developing world. 
It is reach who will become even more reacher once they latch on it by replacing their fiats with cryptos
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:57:28
Not yet. 
Longer the interest rates are kept artificially low deeper the abyss will be. 
And also there is/was no workable alternative to fiat monies (yet)
How come governments are printing trillions of x currencies without any impact on value? 
Smoke and mirrors is my guess

Who says Visa/MasterCard won't be processing Cryptos next year?
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:43:40
True. But we haven't seen mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies yet. 
My bet would be that a technological advances in smartphone and crypto-exchanges propagation will change that. 
If, or when, next world financial crisis happen, I can foresee great run towards alternative to gold commodities.
Speed of transfer and individual's control of the process relative to classic commodities would cause snowball to roll.

The moon is $300,000. 
When it reaches, it will stabilise and then all currencies will be measured by it. 
There won't be reciprocity of nationals currencies with £, $, ¥ or € but with BItcoin.

There are only two places it can go, down to the earth or up to the moon. 
It will not stay $3,300, or $5,000 or $1,900 or $500 
It was never to be by definition. 
The earth - 0
The moon - $300,000
If  1% of population who owns 50% world's wealth keep their 5% net worth in BTC, it will be $300,000
They are far too canny not to do so   
Nothing can stop that.

"There is a wave coming, and better to be on a surfboard than swim against the current. The surfer can never tell the wave where to go: the best it can do is stay afloat and use the wave’s momentum. Those who can feel the wave and anticipate its underlying trend will go the farthest. The wave always reaches the shore, but this is not true for the surfer.
Bitcoin is not a wave, it is tsunami"

I suppose without generous incentive to exchanges very few would be around. 
It is paramount for exchanges to exist and flourish at this stage of cryptocurency evolution/revolution.
Yes, some of them would be very successful, some hacked and some disappear.  
All will be regulated soon too.  
They will disappear however once technology decentralise and matures. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:53:42
Are you implying that advances in technology and geopolitical changes do not affect poor ppl? 
Even more so than western folks. 
It is exactly these people who can and will benefit most from potential surge in acceptance of decentralised currency. 
These are the very people who became slaves to the currency war and wealth drain that is going on at the mo.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:14:30
I've been saying that for some time. 
If 1% of the richest people, who own 50% of the wealth, exchange just 5% of their investable wealth to bitcoins, each one would be worth $300,000. 
From this article it counts the same. If only 5% of the 100tr is invested in bitcoins it would go to the moon - $300,000. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:06:32
They won't do it out of fear that they would loose competitive advantage. 
Look at what happened in China last week.
The users just moved to Japan. 
They are just lost in the haze of speed the technology moves and adapts. 
By definition they are trailing and, you are right, we may see desperate moves in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:50:20
At this stage it would be catastrophic for bitcoin too. 
We need whole ecosystem to evolve where some cryptocurrencies take over fiats role. 
Bitcoin will never replace fiat in true sense. 
Timeline for this to happen? God knows, technology is in hyperdrive 
It could be just months or a few years

In attempt to stop it they will come up wit a SDR Crypto or some other nonsensical shit.

Have you ever asked yourself why he is earning $2 a day?
It is a broken financial system that benefits countries who own reserve currencies and are able to borrow as much as they want. Out of thin air. 
Allow that illiterate peasant to do so, and he can easily buy as many tractors as he want with imaginary money. 
Check m-pesa by the way and enlighten yourself whether there is a need for alternative currency in developing world. 
If that ever happens the bubble we are talking about now may become something no one can even imagine 
Except maybe people like Satoshi

Cashing out is not mater of a particular price but a phase of growth. 
Phase one - early developers 
Phase two- early investors
Phase three -  early users
Phase four - VC investors
Phase five - media enhanced users ( now)
Phase six - institutional investors
Phase seven - mainstream users
I would say we in are early media enhanced users phase.  I would also put cc10x on each phase. 
I wouldn't worry cashing out just yet unless you need money now.

It has nothing to do with being right or wrong. It is an evolutionary process same as internet had been. 
I remember years ago using Compuserve back in early 90s, to be charged £7.50 a month to use internet. 
It is unimaginable today.

Most millionaires are smart, probably well educated and willing to understand new technologies. 
Most of them will accept advice, especially financially related, and when time comes for bitcoin to be universally accepted, they will buy no matter the cost. 
Many of HODLers will have a ceiling , being $3,000, $30,000or $300,000; by nature of order the richness will end with those who can afford to buy. 
Hence $300,000.

If you listen andreas antanopoulus saying that Bitcoin will be attacked many times more as it grows, by banks,  regulators and miners to either destroy it or take over you would see it more clearly. 
The fork is nothing but an attack on decentralised integrity of the system. The obstacle for it is the core, so get them out of the game. Don't expect the attacker to say their real intention. 
It will never happen in any attack, in real life or in bitcoin ecosystem.  
It will always be for the good of the many not few. 
Good luck with that, the core are the most talented and knowledgeable group of coders to walk on earth at the moment and they will outfox the attack.

@_date: 2017-10-19 13:24:38
Absolutely right. Although a large part of the increase of the value is based on speculation. 
However, people who are buying bitcoin are the ones who see through inflationary and money printing fiats policies of central banks. 
There is no reason on earth why would someone hourly rate be worth 15 beers this year and 14 next year. It want be more expensive to brew the beer next year?

We all know what's this about. Fight for the original brand name that become so powerful. 
Whichever of forked chain is more decentralised is the one that follows logic and winning streak of the original Bitcoin. 
As it stands I would vote for Bitcoin core unless someone convince me otherwise.

My interest is with the core as I believe it will keep bitcoin more decentralised.

It is ridiculous to observe Bitcoin growth as a standalone phenomenon. 
It has to be observed in a context of geopolitical and technological situation. 
It may or may not become bubble depending on whether there is going to be a major military conflict, present worldwide currency war outcome or some new technological advance. 
Everything is bubble, it is just a question of time.

C'mon guys. Give her a brake.

There are so many misconceptions in your analysis that would take hours to respond.

In economics, Gresham's law is a monetary principle stating that "bad money drives out good". For example, if there are two forms of commodity money in circulation, which are accepted by law as having similar face value, the more valuable commodity will disappear from circulation.[1][2]
