While $3000 might not be, I actually think 8.43 BTC is worth bragging about. He currently own's one 2.5 millionth of all possible bitcoin. That means that is he holds onto that there can be at most 2.5 million people in the world that hold as much or more bitcoin than he does. In a world population of 7 Billion people if more people start getting into bitcoin, 8.43 bitcoin might be more bitcoin than most people that buy bitcoin in the future will ever own. Think of the future value of that. Bitcoin truly is a limited resource. Sure $3000 of an unlimited resource(Fiat) is not worth bragging about.

How can a person create idea's or patents and declare them public domain or expired that everyone may implement the idea, but prevent banks or other parties from creating similar patents to block those ideas?

If most people are intent at making life better than the day before, they would not keep voting zuma as president as that is working against that goal.

I also have the same whats the point feeling about voting and just don't bother. Other times I just down vote hidden scores when I feel irritated by them. Help to make sure it generates worse ranking.

Is there not a lot of risks using a feature like that? Such as if your private key is compromised it would be a race to spend it between those that have it. It would also give attackers that have the encrypted key time to crack the encrypted key should they get their hands on it. Or if you later learn that there was a key logger on you machine and you need to move the funds to a safe address. Another issue is trust funds often pay out on death of the parents to help support the children, this is obviously not a feature.

Maybe someone can graph the difference between the 2 approaches. According to the op we would be 50% up if we buy 1 bitcoin. What would we be up if we paid X dollars instead?

Check your dropbox version history(right click file on the dropbox) website. Download the oldest version and test if it was encrypted. 
Everyone backed up unencrypted wallets should create new wallets even if they replaced the backups as the history is still there.

My bank does the same. The reason behind it is to fool key loggers.

Gmail may be the most important site of all to activate 2FA on. Because identity theft will be easy for someone who has control of your email account. Not to mention they can retrieve almost any password for any site using the site's forgotten password retrieval. They could also learn allot about you from you email's and Google+ accounts and any other accounts like Facebook they gain access to  allowing them to uncover details about you like answers to security questions etc. Your email is effectively a backdoor to any site.

Yes, generally when it comes to investing the younger you are the greater the risks you can take. The older you get the more conservative your investment decisions. With the potential of bitcoin you have a good opportunity to take a big risk for big returns. However you can manage they risk by keep you eye on the markets and making good decisions. If you do lose some or all. You have many years of life left to recover. Also do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments.

My strategy is to buy some and a little more than I intend owning for long term investment. As the value increases I will slowly sell some to recover my input capital. That way if it all goes to 0 I lost nothing(assuming I manage to sell enough at increased value before it all goes to 0). This strategy increases risk in the short term(since I buy more than I intend to own) but decreases it in the long term(since I got my initial capital investment out again).

It needs a price overlay on the graph so we can see how news affected the price

Currently 1800 BTC is mined per day.
Current BTC 24h volume is 2,594,005 BTC.
So new minted coins only make up 0.07% of the current daily volume.
Halving that would mean 0.035% of daily volume.
And these % become less as volume increases.

I agree it probably won't ever be ready. It's useful for buying and selling only, ie to make a profit. I don't buy into all these people saying they are in it because they believe in the technology. Most people here are in it for the profit.

What change would be generated during a send? Also if sending bitcoin can make your wallet.dat obsolete does this not imply that it would also make paper wallets obsolete?
