"This seems more like a 'hey look, we do bitcoin too' smash-and-grab exercise designed to get free press and free bitcoins at the same time."
As the individual specifically in charge of driving this initiative --- it was my idea to have the BTC -NOT- go to the SunTimes.com.  We are running it as a feasibility test.  
It is going to a charity, Taproot Foundation.
I apologize about previous language, it was uncalled for.

Hey all.. this is the CTO of the Sun Times - the feedback below is great.  BTC is a new frontier for us-- ultimately I would like to extend our BTC payment processing ecosystem into other products, but we had to start somewhere.  I believe strongly in Microtransactions as well, and the Bitwall.io experiment went extremely well -- I don't see the two options as mutually exclusive-- certain customers will always want the "Purhcase All (year)" etc. option.  Other customers may want timed or article-based access.  Anyway.. appreciate the comments, I do read them and they play into how I go about thinking of what we do next.  Newspapers are hurting, we don't have unlimited resources, but BTC is giving us hope to reinvent the way we think about monetizing content.

Unlikely.  But I left the Sun-Times after this test, and would be happy to work with any media company that has the guts to stand by Bitcoin for more than a few (successful) tests ..

Paul :), hey this is Josh, former CTO @ Chicago Sun-Times.  I'd be happy to do the coding &amp; consulting work for this, gratis, for the WSJ.  If it works out, great.. can buy me some pizzas.  Seriously would love to help with this and I know much of the backend stacks and whatnot these large newspapers deploy.
