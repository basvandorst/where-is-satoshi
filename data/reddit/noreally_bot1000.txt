A good point, but if BTC was $100K-$250K and the economic regime has collapsed -- then what good will $dollars do? -- at that point you'd be better of using your BTC to actually buy things.

Should've invested in lootcrates.
Crazy/Evil idea: EA should announce their lootcrates are based on blockchain. EA's market cap would probably explode.

That makes sense to me. But I can buy a gold bar and do the same thing -- it's just a hedge against inflation like any other asset. I can also buy a small fraction of a gold bar (ie 1g gold coin) (just like Bitcoin).
I wonder why there aren't denominations of Bitcoin (ie micro BitCoin -- may 1/1000th of a coin, call it mBTC). Not another crypto-currency, just a smaller unit. Right now, most people, if they've even heard of Bitcoin, will wonder why anyone would pay $15,000 for 1 "coin", especially for something that doesn't physically exist. But they'd probably think it's reasonable to pay $15 for a mBTC.

I'm aware of this. I'm talking about the average person who only heard about Bitcoin last week because it was on the news.
Back when people were buying pizza for 10 Bitcoin, didn't anyone think that was a dumb idea? Considering that the cost of generating a Bitcoin can be calculated (based on the energy required), as well as the future increase in difficulty to generate coins. 
I remember (way back) when someone was offering to give anyone  1 Bitcoin, just for asking, to demonstrate the process. And I was too stupid to ask.

Why would you ever sell? Hodl forever.

Someone ELI5: I thought the point of Bitcoin was that it doesn't use banks, so you avoid huge transaction fees. And it's value comes from what the market decides is a reasonable price for something. 
But it seems most people are just buying Bitcoin, hoping the exchange rate (to $) goes up, then selling on exchanges.
And, because of the rate at which the value of Bitcoin has increased, it doesn't make sense to waste it by actually using it to buy something.
And there are transaction fees to trade Bitcoin, more fees to move it to a wallet (and back) and more fees to convert it to $$, and more fees to move the $$ to a bank.
So what's the point again?
