All good points well made as far as they go, and which certainly point to features that will shorten bitcoin's life. 
So yes, bitcoin will fail, but what you imply is that all crypto currencies suffer these same limitations, and will also fail, leaving the status quo.
The fact is that many projects are now in train *because* of these problems, else why would people bother! 
All radical innovations come with problems. Take trains: in the UK where they began, people failed to see their potential, saw only the accidents and feared the unknown (predicting suffocation at speeds of 40mph!)
Already there are systems that don't rely on a blockchain or expensive proof of work based consensus. All the points you raised are logical and valid criticisms, but I think crypto currencies are here to stay for two reasons. 
Firstly, they will overcome many if not all the issues you highlight. 
Secondly, they will offer both advantages over current systems, such as trusted transactions without a trusted third party, *and* they will enable things that simply can't be done at present, such as self-owning corporations. 
Its easy to spot problems, harder to see how they might be solved, and harder still to imagine what does not yet exist, but which will be enabled.

Its not happening because its not practical - it doesn't scale. People are waiting for a blockchain fix, like side-chains, but they are way off and not likely to compete with a better technical alternative.
What bitcoin has is first mover advantage. But that is never enough. Google SuperCalc/Lotus123, checkout social networks on Wikipedia - the most sticky application you can think of will lose out to a sufficiently better alternative, and people seem to be waiting for that rather than building on a blockchain. Check out [MaidSafe]( for my favourite.

That would work both ways... if bitcoin starts using SafeCoin to incorporate its features it creates demand for SafeCoin, increasing scarcity and adding monetary value in exchange.

Can you be clear - a quote would help - what it is you think he's saying that undermines the viability of bitcoin as a disrupter? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:55:09
OK, thanks for clarifying. *My point* remains that *he misses the point* by making invalid assumptions and irrational arguments. I made an omission by focusing on the ridiculousness of his arguments, which I stand by, and omitting to complete the dot dot dot. 
Had I elaborated I'd have said that where he has a point, it is that bitcoin as it is today may not be the endgame of alt-currency. It isn't perfect, it is the first such system for fuck's sake, so it is likely not the end of the story. He,  and I are talking about bitcoin, but I assumed we're also both talking more generally about alt-currency - it certainly looks like he's making a case against alt-currency and not just bitcoin - so the points you highlight are speculative, and in my opinion, unlikely to derail alt-currency, or stop it from disrupting the financial system. It is people who can't imagine change who get stuck in "but it can't do the same as what we have" arguments for why it won't bring change. That's his underlying problem as I see it. 
It will change things, it will also in part substitute, and run alongside, but the fact this form of a consensus network isn't a drop in replacement for fiat money is not an argument for its not being the biggest change in financial systems, and in many other areas, since the internet. Its not just bitcoin or it's derivatives, the same has been achieved in parallel developments (cf MaidSafe) because the internet makes this technology possible, *and* it is an inevitable and necessary evolutionary step. 
The article lacks vision. But what shocked me was that this inability to envisage change should lead someone who I take to be reputable to make such obviously weak and irrational arguments. Hence my derisive tone. That's what I focused on, and I stand by that.
**EDIT** Interestingly Japan proposes to regulate bitcoin, the first country to do so, and has chosen to treat it like gold, a store of value, rather than as a currency. No bearing, but interesting.

Safecoin ;-)
Only half kidding. There is a role for a public ledger (blockchain) crypto currency, or rather, public crypto transaction notary. But for an anonymous scalable cash style currency, bitcoin is not appropriate, so it's share of that 10% may in fact be quite small.

I hate both ebay and Amazon and always try to find a non-global seller first because they don't pay fair taxes, and have an unfair advantage over businesses that do pay fair taxes. 
This leaves everyone else to pay the taxes they avoid by keeping profits offshore - leaving us to pay for all the infrastructure which they use for free. They also treat their employees badly to increase their profits even more - for example in Amazon they're treated like robots, with monitors that beep an alarm if they take more than 30 seconds to pick an item. 
No respect for people, just for money, and what they can squeeze out of an employee unit before they get ill and are dumped on the state to look after. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 11:34:26
If the thief has the private key and Gox doesn't, the coins are gone, and the thief may as well leave them there unless they can get them into laundered fiat quickly and cover their tracks. That would be hard with this amount of money unless you were a state sized actor. 
Maybe the thief has not been able to do that, but they still have the swag, and Gox has to declare insolvency. 
What's interesting is whether the loss of bitcoin and bank deposits are connected, or just discovered at the same time - maybe *because* they spotted the malleability attacks and realised the existing accounting checks had not been adequate, and... 
It's quite likely the the issues are not otherwise connected, and that Gox don't know how this happened yet - that explanation seems a good fit to me. 
We do know they got hacked, so the private keys, at least for hot wallets may well have been compromised. That way "all your bitcoinz r us" can happen overnight and you are left with cold wallet only, which means instant insolvency, maybe in line with the latest assets/liabilities statement. 
This theft might even have been triggered by the malleability. For example, hackers A are in. Doing this, downloading that, working out how to use their access to get rich and get away with it. Then shit, hackers B start their malleability attack, Gox respond - halt / investigate / fix... 
Hackers A realise that the response to malleability could cut their time short: Gox doing more checks, logs being audited etc. So, they act. They go for broke, copy the hot wallet private keys, delete them from Gox. Only question is, can they be sure Gox don't have copies of the private keys? That's necessary, or they would have to move the coins to new addresses. 
As for the missing fiat, hacking seems to be prime suspect. Maybe that's what hackers A were focused on, fiat being easier to launder, this would explain why they were not in a hurry to bankrupt Gox by taking the hot wallets earlier. 
More speculation - sorry!

@_date: 2014-03-07 15:28:00
Sounds like laundering to me:
- take swag
- break it up into many smaller swaggettes
- sell the swaggettes at, say 30% of value
- you have $130m cash and are away
buyer of swaggette - has smaller chunk of swag, goes through same procedure as above.
Eventually there are lots of small fry walking around with wallets containing stolen coins (10, 100, 1000 coins) using them to buy stuff. Some get caught, but tracing theives up the heirarchy is near impossible - the big fish is away, and so is most of the heirarchy.
I'm sure in reality there may be more to it than this, but this seems a pretty obvious way to handle stolen anything, and it fits with these movements. Expect this kind of pattern to repeat and repeat, and that over time the addresses will be "owned" by more and more individuals who are less and less connected with the original thief/thieves.
# Caveat Emptor
There's a second risk here of course. Anyone buying bitcoin that can be traced back and itentified as stolen is in receipt of stolen goods. That's potentially a crime, but at the very least means they can be taken from you and returned to the owner (which in this case will be the creditors of MtGox, or rather the liquidator in charge of it, who's role is to get as much value back for creditors as possible). So beware any really tempting deals to buy lots of bitcoin! Buyers should purchase small amounts from different sources to minimise this risk.

I'm not sure what issues you allude to, the are many, so please elaborate if I miss your point. 
I don't see such a fork as a problem for two reasons:
1) if it works, what's the problem? So SAFE Network becomes bitcoin based and holders of SafeCoin at the wrong time lose out (just as holders of bitcoin will if something better takers over)
2) bitcoin has the advantage of size for now: of recognition, adoption, support etc. In this sense it is the incumbent with respect to SafeCoin, the challenger. Ironic huh!? Which gives SafeCoin the advantages of that position, plus it's technical advantages, both in crypto currency terms (highly scalable, faster transactions, no blockchain, energy efficiency), and potentially coming with it's own ecosystem (of applications built by developers who believe in SAFE Network and use its built in SafeCoin charging system, which is better suited to micropayments than bitcoin).

Yes, but (even as a physicist) I cannot rule out the possibility that you are a banana. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:00:04
What MaidSafe are attempting is quite awe inspiring. 
SafeCoin is potentially a better currency than bitcoin, filling in the gaps in features while removing the main limitations.
But SafeCoin is only a small part of this endeavor. It could transform the internet, change the model of computing, and foster economic and social changes far greater than we have so far imagined might follow from the bitcoin based cryptocurrency movement. 
Watch this space! Or come and join in the testing if you are willing to compile the client and be ready to farm SafeCoin when SAFE Network launches. It runs on windows, Linux and mac (later mobile too).
Grab the code and instructions from github, and check in at  for help or to join the discussions. The first test network should be live in a few days. If you do, say hi to me 
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:32:47
Have you looked at  Their non blockchain crypto currency (Safecoin) uses an energy efficient consensus mechanism: proof of resource. The network launches in Q4. Transaction rate and latency will far exceed bitcoin, and instead of wasteful mining of bitcoin, the network is made up of "farmers" who are providing storage space, bandwidth and processing power to the network, rather than burning CPU cycles to verify transactions. This also means that anyone can earn coin, not just professionals. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 19:38:59
To expand on DJohnston's correct comment ...the value of SafeCoin is not tied to the network storage/demand. It is a finite but increasing resource that people will want to hold/use because of speculation/utility. The utility part is the key to its value over the long term, and will come from its use both on SAFE Network (e.g. to purchase services, such as apps - though many will be free), and potentially far more importantly, as a stand-alone crypto currency, with all the potential of bitcoin, but none of the disadvantages (no blockchain to download and truly scalable transaction rates).

MaidSafe has a running test network, and a roadmap that you can watch being ticked off each week. It has taken eight years to get here because MaidSafe had to invent shit - they didn't piggy back on the blockchain, they invented key enabling technology, and are building something that promises to do everything the blockchain does, only better. More anonymous, faster, more scalable and more efficiently.
Ethereum started desiging in 2014, they have a lot of bright guys, so its going to be an interesting race, but building that in a year, hmm. They are either going to be held back by the limitations of the blockchain, or will have to invent things / pull together technology from elsewhere. That is all very hard, and it takes a lot of time, no matter how many developers you have.
I was a software professional for over fifteen years, and worked in design and development for thirty. I'll be amazed if Ethereum can do half of what I am now pretty confident MaidSafe have licked. And I'm aware that MaidSafe have held much of what they're aiming for back. 
The next year is going to be *very* exciting :-)

@_date: 2014-03-02 15:55:50
I didn't get to the end of this because, after a dull and questionable start, he goes on to make such weak arguments. For example:
Money is what a State says is money (eg USD); bitcoin is not mandated by a State, ergo it is not money, and here's the really dumb unstated assumption: by implication can't have any of the *qualities* of money. Rubbish, whether State's mandate it or not, contracts can and are written with bitcoin, and those contacts are quicker, easier, cheaper, to create, enact and verify, and provide for new kinds of trading entity that simply can't exist using "money".
Another argument he makes is that States have nothing to fear from an alternative "currency", because he already proved bitcoin is not "money", so it *must* be currency remember. And, because the are no end of currencies already, ergo, bitcoin is nothing new. He says anything can be used as currency, such as Air Miles, and beads, and -you get the idea - and because the banking system has not been rocked, by them, it has nothing to fear from bitcoin. I hope all bankers and economists are this dumb, because if so, anyone in bitcoin now can make a bloody fortune! 
AFAIK, nobody has yet created a system: that anyone can partake in to buy, sell and exchange Air Miles, with no more than an internet connection. Where no third party is needed, allows instant, near zero cost transactions, escrow free exchange, complete convertibility, and most importantly, where no-one can magically create more "currency" without putting real valuable work into the system in competition with every other stake holder, from tiny to mega-Corp. 
Gosh, it's hard to see why anyone would think bitcoin might be a disruptive force. 
Better get out now while we still can.

Can you clarify why bitcoin is better in this respect - doesn't it rely on the majority (50%) of nodes being honest, whereas MaidSafe claim to be more robust in this scenario (ie surviving a 75% attack - or even higher).
Did you discuss the measures to prevent Sybil attacks with MaidSafe? These have been discussed and are catered for. I'm not sure if the detailed papers on the topic are out yet, but I've seen  answer this to my satisfaction more than once. 
Centralisation (your "Google Attack") is a problem, but not as severe as sybil attacks which allow double spend etc, so I think MaidSafe do have the potential to break through the limitations of bitcoin with regard to scalability, transaction latency and transaction rate. 
So the outstanding area is about the robustness of SAFE network itself. Sybil attacks seem handled well enough (better than bitcoin ATM), so its down to sabotage/failure through centralisation, and similar scenarios that rely on creating lots of nodes that can disappear all at once (or are otherwise related).
The have been discussions about ways to handle this on the [MaidSafe community forum]( It is a hard problem, and I don't see an ideal solution ATM, but I do think some of the ideas are workable solutions. Exactly which are employed and how will depend on more analysis of the threats, and more discussion. The more threat scenarios folk here can put forward, the better the likely solutions, so go for it! Post your attack scenarios [here]( :-)

The problem here is partial decentralisation.
Where centralised control exists, even where the tools are decentralised, it represents a massive risk due to single point failures - this is what we're seeing here. The whole future suddenly thrown into doubt by one event.
The solutions that will win out will be completely decentralised - no founder shares - controlled by the community and using a robust concensus mechanism to protect it from attack.
This is the innovation bitcoin provided. Ripple pretended to solve the scalability of bitcoin but removed its robust decentralised mechanism from the ownership of the technology.
There are already solutions which tackle both - fully decentralised control and implementation, while maintaining decentralised ownership.  is the one I have been following and it has the promise of not just a superior crypto-currency, but of much more too.
Even if Ripple gets through this (which I predict will require it to rescind all those founder shares) greed will prevent those in control from solving their basic lack of decentralised control and implementation, so other solutions will win through.
Even bitcoin can do this better, but I think something like [MaidSafe]( is the real solution.
