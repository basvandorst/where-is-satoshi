He means using normal boring old stuff like HTTPS. He doesn't mean using some complex web of bitcoin address hacked up system.

the underground cyber hackers might keep using illegal bitcoin but good luck expecting to still have newegg or microsoft or any actual legitimate company ever want to touch bitcoins ever again.

Blockchains aren't really databases. They provide little if any database functionality.

That is a list of things that have been coming "ANY DAY NOW" for months and months and years. When they come they are not going to be the amazing revolution they pretend they will be.

carl sagan probably would not shill for some hyper libertarian cyber gold standard one world currency though.

That story you just told isn't actually what has happened in any of the countries that ban guns. They basically all see gun crime drop dramatically.

(It's probably because one of the mods is the community manager for changetip. It's pretty obvious that a weird rule that you MUST use a particular service just happens to be in a forum where the guy who's job it is to get people to use that service is the mod)

It seems like this subreddit is all about how bitcoin is going to smash governments and destroy the state then acts all confused when the government takes the constant threats you guys make as actual serious things.

You know how people say "don't invest more than you can afford to lose"? 
If you have no money, don't invest in bitcoin.

And yet actually posting bitcoin addresses or actually using the blockchain in anyway is banned on and just magically the community manager of changetip requires any bitcoin sent around here be done through that service. Weird!

Bitcoin has less users than the number of people that own "pitch perfect 2" on DVD. It hasn't "changed the world" even one bit.

Currently the number of bigmacs that can be bought with a bitcoin is ZERO. Same as the past 7 years.

Expect to not make much money then in a year to have half your income go away and maybe also have your workload increased 8 fold for half the payment.

Remember: you haven't made any money till you sell.

It's a scam no matter what. They give 25+% discounts on things and the clear answer is that it's from carders, but even the "official" answer is some weird tale about people being paid in gift cards that need to cash out into bitcoin for some reason, and even that is against terms of service and not allowed by amazon. So either way it's a scam, either a big illegal scam or a smaller scam.

I would be surprised if any company ever used bitcoin the second someone pointed out a thing like that might be possible with them.

A person running a business will look at euros and see you can't lose them in a cryptolocker and then decide "lets use those, bitcoin sounds hella dumb" 
@_date: 2015-11-19 15:12:23
It's not "backed by internet integrity", you can't redeem it for "internet integrity" and coins like litecoin that use the exact same amount of internet aren't worth the same amount.

Is there any part of bitcoin that doesn't need multiple middlemen to be useable?

Bitcoin really doesn't challenge or attempt to challenge 99% of the things banks actually do and really compete head to head only with maybe checking accounts though. The whole bitcoin vs banks thing is just some dumb narrative drummed up to try to push bitcoin to people that were mad at banks in 2009. Actual banks do a lot of things and few of them are even touched on by bitcoin.
