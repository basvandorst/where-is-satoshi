I've heard that the purchaser (i.e. me) could potentially get in trouble as well

That's all there is to the LN? I thought BTC transactions were already bundled.

You don't think the purchases are done with stolen cards?

Does purse.io usually work - I've seen it before but wasn't certain 
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:33:48
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:46:15
Good point - There's part of my mind that's screaming that this is all just too good to be true.

I think that bitcoin will be characterized by a dramatic boom-&amp;-bust cycle, but with the longterm growth greatly outweighing the drops. Overall,  the cryptos tend to grow in tandem, at least over the long-run. From my experience, after a growth spurt in BTC tapers off, the other main cryptos follow suit. 
Part of the reason LTC started picking up steam after this recent spurt is that bitcoin transfers got so clogged up that people were switching to LTC on exchanges in order to transfer to other exchanges &amp; wallets. 
Long story short, cryptos as a whole tend to grow in tandem. Long term BTC may act as large assets but there is so much room for other cryptos when it comes to working as an actual currency or system of exchange. So, I think if you're aiming to get rich, look for a untapped alt-crypto. The problem is predicting which has staying power.

What methods have you tried thus far?

we have to hold him accountable to his promise if it doesn't reach a million in 3 years
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:51:52
Yes - BTC's transfer methodology isn't as good as some of the newer ones. BTC will likely remain a storehouse of value, just because it was the first, has that brandname weight, &amp; active community backing it. But as an actual currency for exchange &amp; small-scale sales, other cryptocurrencies are better equipped.

At what point do you all think this mad growth rate will start to taper off?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:18:50
Do you actually think it'll reach 1 mil?? I know McAfee &amp; some other BTC fans are saying that, but I just don't if it's realistic or not
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:01:15
Bitcoin is undoubtedly going to climb much higher than it is now -- but I think we might be I  a mini-bubble. The growth is so fast &amp; erratic
@_date: 2019-04-14 14:37:40
That's what I felt too - even if BTG fails, i feel like it was a sincere attempt by folks to do something they felt was important (even if not well thought out)

Won't the ASIC-quality required to mine competitively go up in price (somewhat) in tandem with the output of cheaper hardware?
@_date: 2019-04-14 11:56:40
What about the changing of the PoW Algorithm to GPUs? Is it not feasible?
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:25:28
I see - so by avoiding ASICs, one will need more regular upkeep &amp; modification
@_date: 2019-04-14 13:32:21
Good point!
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:27:50
True, but don't ASICs lead to some centralization? I guess Im asking why the extra decentralization isnt worth the costs. From what I've been told here, it is because there will have to be more regular modification of the code to avoid specialized hardware.

Isn't tumbling illegal or regulated or something?

@_date: 2019-04-14 12:05:11
I really don't know enough on the matter to say. I just know the "idea" of going to GPUs to allow more folks to mine, seemed appealing. Why does mining inevitably lead to ASICs - just because the network can handle the load at a certain point on GPUs?

What? The post was made to refer to that meme. I don't see how this meme (or any meme in general) can be "wrong" when it is was made intentionally for the sake of being funny. Maybe you don't find it funny, by that's a different issue entirely.

Doesn't purse only release the BTC once you receive the Amazon product?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:50:02
According to their FAQ "For your offers to become visible to the public there needs to be 0.1 BTC in your wallet on top of the minimum amount in your offer". So unfortunately yes.
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:31:08
What in the hell should I do to protect the value of my coins, whether S2X or good ole BTC??
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:50:44
I'm selling $20-40 as a trial run, but for the public to be able to see your offer you have to have 0.1 BTC in your wallet on top of that.
