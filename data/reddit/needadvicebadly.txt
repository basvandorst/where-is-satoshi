no, it's a trust-less system.

That's not how profit margins are calculated. But I guess it's also nice I never have to wait for a "Funds are safu" from their CEO every other month.

no protection for simple mistakes either. What? you fat fingered the amount? or you clicked on the wrong link online? lolololol, SFYL.

Sorry I hurt your feelings.

yeah dude, buy as much as you can now. If you could, just convert all your assets into bitcoin, or preferably altcoins - bcash sounds promising. Take as many fiat loans as possible too, maybe a second mortgage and max all your credit cards. Fiat has no value anyway, so it's not like that'll ever hurt you. I'm sure any reasonable creditor would drop your debt if you explain how you got fiat from them and that it has no value. 
Consider this financial advice. Here is my SSN (123-45-6789) in case it doesn't work out for you and you need to sue me in the future. 
My only ask is that if, *if*, it doesn't work out for you, that you post your story here so others can have a chuckle. It's the least you can do.

If you exclude all businesses using third party processors, are there any left that accept bitcoin?

so can bitcoin. It's either the coins, or torture, or indefinite jail, or your life, or your family's life. Your call. same with gold if you're hiding it.

You can keep your BTC Classic, while BTC ticker becomes the new chain. No big deal.

Here is what you should do. Sell everything you have now, and as soon as it hits 1k, buy with the same amount again. Now you have 3.8x bitcoins.

You think no one has ~$40k in savings?
