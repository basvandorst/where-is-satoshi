I'm invested in bitcoin and understand almost everything so far but there are a few terms I need to learn such as "fork" and "block chain" what is it? I'm a quick learner just need a 5 second explanation 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:18:04
I feel like nay Sayers just go off on rants about it being a scam or fake because they want to convince themselves this can't be true and that they aren't actually missing out on this, I've literally told my brother and close friend what I've made from my investment and they look at me like I'm dumb/crazy lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:27:32

@_date: 2017-12-24 20:24:20
I freaked out but didn't sell...fuck I wish i would have bought though but I'm already 20% of my wealth into this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:17
I just spent all my bitcoin money yesterday at $15500 , should I be discouraged or nah?
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:59:00
This shit literally just happen to me the other day when bitcoin was going from 12k to 14k in seconds I took a 200 loss to pull all my lite coin and eth coins  to put it all in bitcoin..........now lite coins up $70 from when I sold (I had 4.7 coins) and eth is up about $50 from when I sold(I had 3)...bitcoin? that's dropped since my panic this shit is real
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:10:07

@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:18
plus coin base keeps records for you 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:39
I've made 8k in a week off bitcoin....my job doesn't pay that in a month, each time it goes up and I don't invest I throw up in my mouth for not putting more money into it, I'm addicted like for real
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:38
EDIT - I spent what I wanted to invest*

is @ gemini ever planning on a freaking iphone app? they just believe everyone owns a computer that buys and sells ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:19:12
So just so I'm clear  once sold the money instantly goes into the usd portion of of coinbase at which time I can buy again just as quick? thank you so much in advance =]
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:29:43
I completely agree but me personally( been in this since 8k) reddit actually convinced me to invest, when I tell my friends my sources they laugh like "dude your going off what people post on reddit, memes and you just risk it all"... well yea isn't that how bitcoin works?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:21:49
Well I'm invested in eth (small amount) I want to sell quick and move it into either bitcoin or litecoin(because so far those have been my best coins)
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:00:35
now its back down to 11k =[
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:48:03


 how do I figure this out???
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:08:02
but I'm in the same boat
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:02:11
I believe in it for sure but its just super scary dropping the kind of paper I have in it and wondering if I need to drop more or If I should be good where I'm at Its hard to know really, I'm waiting until the point that its worth so much money that I can pull out what I first invested and still look nice.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:23:18
This part has me confused, I get everything else but why can't it be duplicated?

I have a question I've been in the game for about a year and have always had my hard wallet( nana s) close to me and my 24 word seed it put up . Because I've never lost my wallet I haven't ran into problems but lets say my house burns down or my wallet gets destroyed somehow, can that 24 word seed somehow save me?

Does this pay real btc

Hodl until your kids are old
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:14:44
I work all the time , reddit is really the only research I can do since I'm talking to people that understand the market and are currently using this stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:28:37
Wouldn't it be safer to have a cold storage such as a bitcoin card?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:56:22
so where do us coin base newbs go?
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:59:41
You mf I was about to go buy some
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:35:05


how do I buy large quantity "over 10k" without getting f'd in the a? do you see anywhere where I said I want to invest just 10k?
edit- coinbase only allows you to invest $7500 each week, make sense now?
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:44:53
no I feel like a dumb ass ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:56:10
Yea I feel the same I lol at 2k I lol at 7500 being the end of this and now I'm the dummy that said screw it at $9600

Thanks for the advice  nodeocracy, what is your stance on litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:11:07
Thanks that helps me with that =] Waht about selling big? coinbase only allows sales up to 50k?
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:08:35

@_date: 2019-02-24 21:19:21

@_date: 2017-11-24 20:26:43
don't do it?
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:23:48
so will this happen again? I just need to know before I dump everything into this
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:08:40
They can be hacked
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:38:00
so when prices drop a few $100, hang in there until it shoots up again? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:54:54
bitcoin? how did you do it?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:08:38
Thank you for the advice I will do that =]
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:23:41
I've done research, I'm still learning as well, so far I've made a  decent little profits on small trades, all I'm asking is how do you go big?? Asking questions is really the only way to learn
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:59:18
I'm at work and can't watch video
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:16:50

@_date: 2017-11-25 23:42:28
Thanks for the knowledge . I don't see why everyone else is such a jerk when you have questions about this stuff? but again thanks I will be looking into these sites.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:37:39
I've made $40 in the last week from litecoin so I believe its up and coming , I'm there with you on ETH.  bch that is bitcoin cash right? sorry I'm learning still but I'm starting to get good at this lol =]
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:30:26
I've held shits in longer than I've held bitcoin, I can do this (holding since 2017)
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:48:11
coinbase bought me everything
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:12:55
how do I buy large quantity over 10k without getting f'd in the a?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:23:28
Because its unlike stocks bitcoin is currency, may places already are adapting to bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:34:47
following because I have the same question
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:48:55

@_date: 2019-04-26 14:11:55
This is going to sound dumb, I don't care does a node mine btc?
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:44:03
So then basically a node is good for what? I'm sure I sound stupid but I'm really just a ghost hodler who has a hard wallet with his btc stored and I don't really think about it much
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:36:22
