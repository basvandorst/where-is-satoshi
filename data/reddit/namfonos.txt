They've got all the keys to every last coin.
Satoshi is not one person. He's not in his 20's or even 30's. He didn't come up with the project one day and launch it a year later.
More realistically:
* 4 to 8 men. 
* In their 40's, 50's, and maybe some 60's.
* Most likely they are in a University setting. (There are quite a few good reasons why this makes sense.)
* Degrees/Focus among them probably include Computer Science, Economics, Applied Math, Cryptography, Distributed Computing.
On no planet is Satoshi one person. The only reason that is even an option is because we don't often associate a username to more than one user.
Bitcoin is deeply layered with extremely complex ideas. Each level requires thorough knowledge and understanding that can realistically only come from a group of people who have been practicing their respective fields for 20+ years.
This was not just some idea like facebook that someone had and then coded it in their dorm. This probably comes from years of watching the news and following politics and the dissatisfaction with one aspect or another in the current system. Some semblance of the idea for Bitcoin (specifically the solution for double spend) probably even existed (within the group) in the late 90's early 2000's.
These people knew what they were doing. They still know what they are doing. No one is throwing out a potential trillion dollars for some poetry.
But. What the fuck do I know

The ~900k bitcoins is what we've been able to link to Satoshi because of a particular mining pattern. We have no idea how many they actually mined. They might all have a modest 1000 bitcoins that they're free to spend.
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:50:06
That's only a million dollars a coin. This time last year we were barely at $20.00 usd. We're at $1,000.00 usd now. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be a global currency. That means 7+ billion people on the planet will have to be able to participate. For that many people to be able to meaningfully transact in the currency (that means buying/selling more than just a couple dollars worth of something) bitcoin will have to become a trillion dollar market cap project.
End of this year we should be between 10k and 100k.

Digital currencies. Yes. The solution to the double spend problem. No.
Somehow you just took the idea of the blockchain, mining, private/public key cryptography, deflationary currency, the 100 other features of bitcoin that haven't even been explored yet and too many other principles for me to list and basically said:
yA 'f u no how 2 c0mPutER then it's eZ.  brothers friend says he knows satoshi.
Bitcoin is in fact one of the craziest fucking ideas ever.
@_date: 2013-04-21 22:07:16
people don't know the current price. some people panic. speculators foresee panic and sell with the panic to buy back at lower price. any kind of new uncertain negative information will cause some price droppage. sell now. buy back in a few dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:54:13
hahah. $50. we do that shit in a day now.

he said the year [2040]( it's actually 2140
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:54:46
same here
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:23:43
Why do they think that the million bitcoins mined by satoshi are lost? Just because none of them have been used yet? I would assume that he knows what he's doing and is holding on to them when they're actually worth something. Not a measly 200 dollars a coin. He has a little more foresight than that.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:47:36
you don't have to spend the coins you're saving. if you want to make a bitcoin purchase, you can just do it in one transaction. Cash -&gt;bitcoin -&gt; product. and forget about it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:20:59
I'm beta testing it. You can also use it to make trades, by clicking on the existing bid/ask orders. It will fill out the full price to the 5th decimal. very convenient. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:40:48
dude. it's gotten so weird for me that I can't jerk off now without the depth chart side by side with my porn.

Bitcoin is new. It's not like the dollar or any other currency yet. It's more like stock at the moment. You're definitely right that a currency that can buy a cup of coffee today and a house for the same amount tomorrow is not safe or good. But it's only 4 years old. And there is only about 21 million total that will ever be made. For bitcoin to be a successful global currency there has to be enough for everyone. That means each coin is going to have to worth like $1,000,000 at some point.
My guess is, that until all of the coins are mined (which is sometime in the year 2140) the price will not stabilize like other currencies. 
Which is good for making money on insane growth. But that means that it won't be used like regular currency for a while. 
Best advice. Buy now. Buy often. This shit isn't gonna stop. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:58:16
Everybody participating in bitcoin should be operating under the assumption that this is the case. It would be stupid not to realize that there are a few people like the Winklevii Twins (1% at the moment) who hold large sums of bitcoins. And bitcoin hasn't crashed because of them yet.

@_date: 2013-04-22 06:52:13
no. the speculators are confident that the price is going to drop and will rebound shortly. they want to make money. sell high. buy low.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:58:03
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate on what you wrote because I'm too busy admiring all of my upvotes. 
Also, have patience. The first cryptocurrency has only just arrived. Displacing the entire financial system that has existed for a couple hundred years is going to take a little longer than 4 years.
Sorry if we're not moving fast enough for you. Maybe you should buy some coins while you wait.

what's even funnier is that in a month, maybe even just a couple weeks, we're all going to be begging for coin as cheap as 140. I know I would love to buy some more coin at the low low price of 100$/btc
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:41:16
that's why he's (they're) not spending them when bitcoin is still in its infancy. You're right, if he spent them right now, some people may not like the idea that there's probably a soon to be trillionaire looming in the background. The best move on his part would be to wait until we've fully adopted and embraced bitcoin into society (like 50 years) to a point where it's a household name, every brick and mortar accepts it, you can pay your credit cards/taxes with it and no one has to think about its future anymore. the whole 9 yards. then he won't have to cash out causing a market drop, or fluctuating prices. he can just use it. if his intents are good then he won't fuck shit up.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:03:23
2 points to that statement.
1) I'm referring to a point when he won't have to sell anything. We're a society that operates on bitcoin. He spends, not sells.
2) We have to assume that he does have access to them. Right now this is probably one of the reasons why the opponents of bitcoin are not getting on board. Who wants to get in on something thats gonna make someone else richer than god. 
As any creator of any successful product, you are going to get rich.
There probably will be market fluctuations because crazy news like Satoshi is alive and spending would do that. Just like the AP twitter hack: white house explosion obama hurt. Stock prices came down, but then recovered.

closed beta at the moment. We're testing the trading tool I mentioned above which requires you to connect your gox api to the website.
if people want in pm me and I can convey the message.

Ah HA! So you agree. They are of value. Case closed sir.


Every group is going to have some die hard fanatics. But just so you have the proper perspective on things. Paypal has existed since 1998. Only in the last few years has it become ubiquitous.


1 Billion dollar market cap in 4 years is slow? What planet do you live on?

thats really funny. i just had the same thought and wanted to see what others were saying. lucky for me i have my own private source.

hahahahaah. that guys doesn't even know how a computer works. or is his own cell phone, the internet, or google. he probably doesn't know the difference between a browser and a search engine. what century was he even born in? he needs to hurry up and die. he's using up our precious oxygen.

This is a help thread for a company that is being shady.
But you're right. Bitcoin is the future. Long live bitcoin.
