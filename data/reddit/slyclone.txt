I bought in at just over 1k, if it drops down below that, I'll be worried, other than that, I'm still happy, and am optimistic that it will continue to grow and expand.

I don't know why people are being so negative here. I want to know why the price is dropping. S Korea in talks of banning it combined with this explains the bear market we've been seeing.

If Bitcoin total market cap drops below 100M (which is like 5750 or something near that, don't feel like doing the math) the open futures markets close down and we won't get assholes who drop hundred millions on shorting it.

My apologies on the Tokens vs Coins. I've been doing some stuff with ETH Tokens, and I used the wrong word. 
I mostly understand how mining works. 
On chain. If you send me 1 BTC, that transaction will be sent to a node, added to a block, mined, which makes a permanent part of the blockchain, which is immutable and permanent. 
Off chain. You send me 1 BTC. What makes that transaction permanent? Who is verifying it? Who/what records that it is mine now? The blockchain is no longer accurate to where that BTC is.

I kind of understand that.  
Here's a question for you.  I send 1 btc from on-chain to my lightning address. 
I send you the 1 btc.  You keep it off chain and send it to someone else.  
I re-play my own sending and send someone else 1 btc, and he puts that transaction back on the blockchain.  
How can being off-chain keep someone from hacking their own setup like that?  Without the blockchain to verify the transactions, what is to keep this from happening?

You're right I'm ignorant.  That's why I'm trying to learn.  I went about it in the wrong way, but I really am just trying to figure this out. 
1. The blockchain, from what I know, is what makes Bitcoin immutable (in association with Miners and Nodes).  Lightning removes transactions from this, unless the recipient decides to add this information afterwards. 
2. The lightning network still allows transmitting value without trust, I agree, I would think (as I know SOOOO little about the Lightning network) that this would make the trust less, as there is no world-wide history of the transactions within the Lightning network. 
3. Lightning isn't a token, I agree.  I think what I meant was to say that the Bitcoin tokens which are being sent to/spent on the lightning network. 
I want to utilize it, and I want to like it, and I want it to be the future, however I just have some concerns which I want to clear up.

You just contradicted your own statement. 


It doesn't change the immutablility of the blockchain, but it does make it less accurate.  If you send me 1 BTC for payment of something on the Lightning Network, the blockchain still says you own it. 
Yes, I could change that, but that is only if I choose to.  This makes the blockchain not accurate.

The instant transfer of money off-chain is an awesome feature, however the lack of fees is something that can be almost eliminated if the blocks on-chain have the capacity to keep up with demand. 
If I receive the BTC from you, I can spend that to someone else off-chain, and so on.  
If lightning networks expands and becomes the primary, no one would have a reason to go back to on-chain transactions, which means the blockchain wouldn't even be close to what actually is.

You send me money on the Blockchain, typically that means you're the one that will pay the transaction fees.  This puts the transaction on the Blockchain which makes it permanent. 
You send me money on the Lightning network, there is almost zero network fees to pay, however it will never make it on the Blockchain, unless I pay the network transaction.  
The solution you're solving by making the load on the on-chain transaction less, removes the permanence and accuracy of the blockchain.

Dimon is just trying to ride the coat tails of the China scare so the price continues to drop a little more just so he can get in. He is scared he missed the boat so he's jumping in, but dropping the price before he does it.

I'm doing okay. I trust the market, however it's tough.  To counter the desire to get out.  I'm not connecting my bank account to Coinbase, so I cannot sell any BTC yet.
