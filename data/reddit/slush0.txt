No need to use TREZOR for hot wallet. And transfers from cold wallet does not happen so often.
AFAIK coinmate.io uses TREZORs for cold storages (and only CEO and CFO have keys).

USB-C reduction + micro USB cable should work (works on desktop, didn't tried it on mobile yet).
@_date: 2016-08-19 22:59:39
In Electrum you'll select "Create new hardware wallet -&gt; TREZOR". It will create new Electrum wallet file, but it will contain only some metadata like cached transaction history, no private keys. That way, you can use Electrum for your existing "software" Electrum wallets and with TREZOR device at the same time.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:19:42
Nobody talks about storing everything in TREZOR. But fairly ~90% of exchange holdings could be stored in cold storage / TREZOR. 10% should be far enough for hotwallet, serving automatic withdrawals.
@_date: 2016-08-31 14:05:28
We optimized some things like device initialization and display rendering, so the UX is a bit smoother :).
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:51:34
Not so easy. Without ability to keep factory-generated private information in the device, nobody can confirm the device is genuine. Cloned device can "sign" the nonce with serial number of original device.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:16:00
As you corrected yourself, there's no way to walk around the timeout by unplugging the device. Actually the principle is pretty smart, TREZOR increase an unsuccessful attempt counter before it actually test the PIN, and if the PIN is correct, then zero the counter and let the user continue.

Service at mytrezor.com is not opensource, althought its latest compiled version can be downloaded from  and run locally as a mirror, independently to Amazon servers.
@_date: 2016-08-20 02:44:29
Mytrezor development eats significant portion of development costs and it wasn't funny to see how crappy chinese clones takes everything for free. It was hard decision, but in the end we decided to keep it closed.

It was just uploaded. We waited with news until it propagates thru google servers, but you were faster :).

ETH support is actually coded, goes out with next firmware release.
@_date: 2016-08-11 04:11:16
You can use Electrum with your own server or you can run Mytrezor against you own instance of Core+bitpay's bitcore to prevent any data leakage. Its for advanced users though and should be better documented.
@_date: 2016-08-18 12:36:04
For historical reasons we have more domains, but for years we propagate buytrezor.com as an only TREZOR eshop.
However we recently acquired trezor.io, which we plan to use as a main domain for all official TREZOR-related sites and services. The domain "leaked" with our medium.com blog, which supports only one CNAME for the Publication. We'll announce trezor.io as an official site soon, with new website design and together with migration of all services there.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:41:03
Do multisig right is much harder than easy setup with TREZOR; cost of complex setup should be a part of security model and disaster recovery scenarios.
Alternatively you can use TREZOR as cosigner in multisig setup, too.

One cannot rely on visual check of standard PCB with four components on it. The hardware is extremely easy to clone. With cloned hardware loaded with customized software, receiving preloaded OpenDIME from untrusted party (=its main use case) is huge security risk.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:56:20


No. Our database was not compromised (or at least I don't have any indication of that). For example, I have many accounts on our eshop for testing purposes, which are not linked to my identity in any way. I did not received single phishing email to them yet.


Somebody copy&amp;pasted our HTML and put it on fake domain. Then took email database of many leaked mailing lists (think of MtGox and dozen others) and spam them all about the fake offer. That's nothing what we can prevent.
We're loud about our official site (buytrezor.com). We also reported that phishing attempt to NameCheap (registrator) and Google. I don't think we can do more now.
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:27:20
Well, if OpenDime is focused to offline transactions between untrusted parties, then it fails to deliver its purpose. You cannot trust the device it works as expected, and you'll only know when you try to unseal them and send coins to another wallet.
If you cannot prove this in time of doing the exchange, you can use paper wallet with almost the same security. Which is obvoiously dumb when you can do proper bitcoin transaction instead. Opendime just packs paper wallet security into nicer package, but it creates false sense of security.
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:02:49
You even don't need to import seed anywhere, you can just connect TREZOR to these applications. Imoorting seed is useful in cases you lose or break TREZOR and you need to access your coins without it.
@_date: 2016-08-19 22:56:39
That version is actually pretty old.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:07:49
We already reported the site to namecheap and google. Usually they block the site in few hours.
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:05:50
Just small correction, python-trezor is not a wallet, just a library for integrating TREZOR (Electrum uses it, for example). There's bundled command line utility for managing TREZOR (initialization, recovery, firmware upgrade, ...) but it does not provide signing capability (yet).

Correct. Chrome extension was released just a year ago and only for Chrome users, but people are using also Trezor Bridge, which is here for a longer time and supports all browsers and operating systems.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:02:56


I still don't think Nano S cover all three highlights. Especially that "easy of use" part; I consider that "on device" setup, recovery and PIN entry focused to nerds. I cannot imagine I'll enter PIN like that many times a day (as I'm doing with Trezor and numeric keyboard of my computer in matter of three seconds).
@_date: 2016-08-19 21:00:11
Yesterday, our Bitcore backend was down for few hours, but it did not affect availability of myTREZOR wallet at all. myTREZOR allow you to connect to any Bitcore server (which is opensource), it is a matter of click in application settings.
Aside from that, you can use TREZOR with many other services and apps like Mycelium, Electrum, Copay or Multibit. You'll see the same tx history and balance as in myTREZOR, because all these wallets use BIP44 standard. We're doing our best to have no single point of failure...
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:47:07
Well, it's word against word. Except this claim, I don't have any reason to think the database leaked.
OP stated exactly:


However he did not specified what he means by "for Trezor". Does it mean "for buytrezor.com domain only"? Or did he used it elsewhere Trezor-related? Some Trezor-compatible wallet services uses email for registration purposes, which may be also considered "for Trezor", but those sites are not linked to SatoshiLabs in any way. I'm not saying that anybody is lying, but the statement is not clear. Also we asked him to contact our support and let us know the email, so we can check our database and confirm the email looks unique/disposal.
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:13:22
We also think about turning the app into integration platform like our TREZOR Connect for websites, so it will be trivial to integrate TREZOR into other Android app without reinventing wheels.
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:59:24
TREZOR security works the same as on normal computer. That means coins from TREZOR are sent out only after manual confirmation on TREZOR display. I actually think that TREZOR+Android gives slightly better security than TREZOR+PC because of native application sandboxing on phone (PC is more vulnerable to phishing, keylogging etc).
@_date: 2016-08-31 16:55:47
I don't have hands on experience with OpenOTP, but from the website it looks U2F is supported. If so, TREZOR will work with it, too.
@_date: 2016-08-19 20:55:44
If you connect initialized TREZOR to Mycelium or Electrum, seed length actually does not matter. And yes, it will work normally and you'll see the same balance and tx history.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:55:20

It's just a firmware update. TREZOR can hold multiple coins at once, like DASH or Litecoin nowadays.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:56:16
So far I don't have any reason to think our customer database leaked. Looks like the database was acquired by another channels (OpenBazaar etc).
@_date: 2016-08-11 04:07:34
Yes and no. You need to install Bitpay Bitcore on top of Core, then you can use mytrezor with your own node. Supporting Core directly is not possible for technical reasons. But if you care about privacy and dont have a problem with installing some extra tools around, then it will work for you.
@_date: 2016-08-20 09:20:40
Ethereum is in progress ( plus we're going by "harder way", by integrating TREZOR into official client, instead of producing some basic wallet which lacks lot of features like contracts. Also, integrating ShapeShift may be convenient, but it does not enable anything what wasn't possible before. You can use BTC, LTC and Dash easily with Electrum clones for these coins (for example Dash propagates Electrum-dash directly on their homepage).
There's actually a lot of development on TREZOR side, like Password manager, FIDO (2FA implementation) or even myTREZOR, which slowly enables more and more "advanced" features.
There's also interesting development on hardware side; we organize TREZOR hackathon in two months, where first hackers will have a chance to look under the hood of new architecture. However we prefer to announce working products, so no more public information yet. Still, considering all this, I don't think you can tell there's no development in TREZOR :-).
What I see as our main disadvantage so far is that we're unable to communicate what everything is possible with TREZOR to our customers. For that reason we're also working on new website :-).
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:46:15
I consider Bitcore more robust solution than Electrum servers. That's also why Mytrezor uses Bitcore.

@_date: 2016-08-20 07:21:35
Well, Ledger released new product, because they finally realized that on-device display matter. TREZOR had it since day 1, so technically there's no need for new hardware. Anyway there's something new in development, too It's just too soon for more details.
@_date: 2016-08-17 19:32:52
No, that's different story. "Issuer" is final customer with no relation to OpenDime. I still don't understand how this should work securely.
The attack vector is not "stolen and cloned OpenDime". The attack vector is to create the device which looks like loaded OpenDime, which has real private key inside it (so it can pass all checks provided by OpenDime infrastructure), but after unsealing, it does not provide private key. Of course the private key is known by attacker, so he can redeem coins at any time (even after he exchanged this fake device with you for a container of goods).
The difference between OpenDime and TREZOR is that TREZOR is private device, initialized and used by the same owner. We do not encourage users to swap loaded TREZORs between users, which is what OpenDime does.
@_date: 2016-08-31 13:19:30
I do not recommend to use rooted phones, however Mycelium+TREZOR security is still based on TREZOR, so until you validate what's on TREZOR screen, you'll be fine :-).
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:16:24


You cannot prove that.
You also cannot prove that you can get private key from the device (although it can be proven the private key is actually inside).
@_date: 2016-04-12 21:35:49
No, not yet. Bitcore is adding address index INTO Bitcoin Core, so you need to reindex anyway (now and even in the future, when both separate components will talk over ZeroMQ).
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:33:35
We've been shipping spare cables for long time. Recently we started to ship Trezors from another batch, where're cables of much better quality, so I assume this problem is going away, too.
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:28:36
There're two ways of doing things. Easy and proper. We decided to go with harder way and support TREZOR in main Ethereum app, which gives our users more comfortable and full featured experience. However, it takes some time as we integrate TREZOR to 3rd party software.
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:49:42
There's always compromise between usability and security. You really cannot compare usability (ease of use) of webwallet with hardware wallet, where are some extra steps needed by design (recovery seed etc).
Still there's no other hardware wallet which is that secure, proven AND as easy to use like Trezor.
@_date: 2016-08-18 11:42:05
Sure, me neither. That's why I use TREZOR with it :-).
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:21:09


No way, my friend. Please don't compare OpenDime with TREZOR.
It's not about hardware itself (although TREZOR use slightly better chips for given purpose), but about security principles build around that device. We strongly discourage people to exchange loaded TREZOR itself as a transaction tool. Although one can confirm that TREZOR is actually loaded, nobody can confirm there's not a copy of seed elsewhere (actually TREZOR encourage users to make offline backup during setup).
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:40:48
TREZOR manager is not a replacement for Mycelium. It is actually a tool for device setup, firmware update, seed recovery and other tasks like PIN change which are not implemented in Mycelium. There's even a button to launch Mycelium as a wallet directly in the app...
TREZOR Manager and Mycelium are now enough to fully enjoy Trezor devices on phones and tablets without a need of PC. But wait for press release tomorrow :).
@_date: 2016-08-11 08:16:11

@_date: 2016-08-19 21:09:07
Both Mycelium and Electrum have support for passphrase, so it works exactly like myTREZOR. So yes, to unlock your passphrase-protected account, you have to provide the same passphrase to  see your funds.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:16:21
Thanks for answering, I appreciate your feedback. Trezor is definitely not behind the latest development, we're just marketing it differently.


You know it is actually unfair to compare existing product with product which does not exist yet :-). Whereas Ledger have bold announcements what they WILL have ready soon (they announced Blue somewhere on end of summer last year), we want to show what we already have done. I'm very happy with our current development and I believe we're going in right direction. There just wasn't any need to make announcements about that ;).
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:16:13
Can you please elaborate how this should work, considering current OpenDime hardware? There's no "secure element" which can hold some secret from factory.
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:45:24
I would like to know your reasoning. It would be awesome to write us some feedback to support I really don't feel it is outdated, but maybe you have some good points what to improve. Trezor was first of its kind, but still there's no real competitor yet ;).

Bitcore is opensource server, anybody can run it on its own. Right now there're four public Bitcore servers - ours, Bitpay, Localbitcoins and Blockexplorer.com. So no need to rely on Bitpay.

@_date: 2016-04-26 19:13:34
Ad backend issues - we're addressing it by running mytrezor against Bitpay's Bitcore server. It is currently on beta.mytrezor.com and will be on main domain soon. My opinion is that Mytrezor+Bitcore is much more usable than Electrum nowadays, which is lacking in user design and stability.
@_date: 2018-09-07 14:43:48
No. Mine is "[ln1.satoshilabs.com](
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:41:17
True, but you didn't have a chance to remove it, re-compile and put into your miner; miners had to wait until Bitmain released new binary.
With Braiins OS, you can actually compile from source into binary to upload to your miner. And do whatever change you want in the meantime. Which is huge difference.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:23:05

BitID did not specified HD derivation path until this commit:
Which was later than Mycelium guys discussed BIP32 path with us and implemented it in their way (which makes it better compatible for future TREZOR Connect integratio).
It looks reasonable for me to NOT use different BIP32 path for BitID and TREZOR Connect, but it would require small change of BitID proposal, as TREZOR Connect simply defined it first :-).
Please see  for description of HD path used by TREZOR and Mycelium.

Trezor uses both STM32F205RE on-chip HRNG and entropy provided by host computer. More or less sha256(trezor_hrng + computer_entropy). Thanks to this, one would need to control both entropy sources to get the seed.

Most likely yes.

Sales are in thousands of units, and we don't have any reason to be disappointed. Actually it gets better that was my personal guess. When we planned first batch, we wanted to do just 2000 units, and I'm quite happy that our producer convinced us to run much bigger production, otherwise we would be out of units long time ago.
Bitcoin is still quite small community and such specialized device like hardware wallet is not useful for anybody, but for people who maintain higher amounts in bitcoin, so anybody who expects sales in tens of thousands units or more is simply out of reality.

If there's any suspicion, re-uploading and validating the firmware would fix 99% of possible scenarios like this. Don't forget, TREZOR is fully deterministic, so you can run blackbox tests on it to prove it behaves like it should!


Sign your TREZOR with pen. Problem solved. I have marked my devices :-).


We do use multisig for TREZOR firmware so there's not a single person able to sign it.


By uploading unsigned firmware, seed is removed from the device. *if* user still ignored big error message on device bootup AND press button to confirm it AND do a seed recovery to this device, then yes, he's screwed, but he most likely deserve it ;-).


Actually the screen is so tiny so even people watching it closely may have problems in reading it ;-). I highly doubt that it can be captured unless you show screen directly to the camera.

Multisig is in development right now. Trezor is compatible with bitID already, in term that it has signing capability. However website must know how to talk with Trezor. There's how it will look on Greenaddress.it: 
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:03:20
Multisig is general concept of more private keys signing one transaction. With Trezor support of multisig, Trezor can be involved in such transaction.
However UI implementation rely on wallet software (Armory, Greenaddress, later myTREZOR)
@_date: 2014-10-31 22:18:13
Can you compute bitcoin transaction in your head? Good for you!
Even paper wallet "rely" on 3rd party software, and you must load private keys to that software.
With TREZOR, you don't need to trust any 3rd software like Multibit or Electrum at all, because your private keys never leave the device. TREZOR is much safer than paper wallet an this point.
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:39:27
Actually we changed the mind since that post, because we realized that people still calculate everything in fiat currency, not in BTC. So the Trezor price will be pegged in USD, sold for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:48:09


Correct. Although writing down 7x shares encoded to english words won't be user friendly anymore :(.


Plus Passphrase, which can be stored in your brain or on another location. Every paranoid user who care about such attacks is most likely use Passphrase anyway.


Not necessary. If someone will want extreme security (SSSS/multisig together with hardware wallet) for his long term savings for cheap, he can load those Recovery seeds one by one to TREZOR to partially sign final transaction.
Not very comfortable, but can be done with one TREZOR only and it is even more secure than SSSS.

ad 1) Trezor isn't tied with any software, and it works with various wallet (Electrum 2.0, Multibit HD, soon Armory etc) , as it has been already answered above. We're planning Android app for TREZOR, but desktop wallet is out of our current scope.
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:52:17
Not only user confirmation; device must be started in special mode (by pressing both buttons during power up) to prevent accidental update.
Plus it is checking digital signature of uploaded firmware. If the signature is invalid, bootloader erase internal storage to prevent stealing coins by unofficial firmware.
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:02:38
TREZOR itself is coin-agnostic. It's just up to controlling software (myTREZOR, Electrum, Armory, ...) if it indexes altcoin's blockchain. For example, Electrum-LTC 2.0 has both LTC and TREZOR support...
As I already mentioned above, we're working on myTREZOR so it will work with almost any block explorer instead of our current BTC-only backend. When this work is done, myTREZOR will be able to understand almost any altcoin...

This is already answered here: 
Although I'm very sorry for such issues, they're not affecting security of your coins. Even if we go bankrupt tomorrow and we shut down all our infrastructure, there're already many opensource tools for TREZOR: You can use your TREZOR directly with Electrum 2.0 (will be released in few days by Electrum developers) or with Multibit HD (demo supporting TREZOR is already available) or there're software implementations like Wallet32 or Mycelium (both Android wallets) which can load Recovery seed produced by TREZOR, so you can move your coins elsewhere even without TREZOR device.
That said, I think infrastructure around TREZOR is quite solid and you don't need to worry about your coins.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:40:12
Well, it *should*. But instead of having 12 seed words and 12 fake words, using 24 seed words by default is more secure even for multiple recovery.

Not yet, but very soon. Such feature is our top priority in development.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:43:38
Right now there's only one fully compatible wallet, Android's Wallet32. But others are quite close (Electrum see all transactions, although default gap limit is different that ours and it must be changed manually in settings) and others are promising to be (Multibit HD).
Btw there is such standard - ours :-). Such things as gap limit and account discovery process are described in BIP44.

Hi all, please wait with your questions, we'll start new thread ~~tomorrow~~ on Wednesday at 17.00 UTC!
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:49:18
For restoring coins from Trezor, any wallet using BIP44 and BIP39 will do the job. At the moment:
* Electrum 2.0 with Trezor plugin
* Mycelium 2.0
* Wallet32
* Multibit HD (beta)
Both BIP39 and BIP44 are well described in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals, so such information necessary for restoring seeds will be around for quite long time :).
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:53:39
Actually it *is* designed to replace "cold storages". Trezor produces "Recovery seed", which is basically paper wallet. But Trezor also offer secure way how to spend from this recovery seed, which is typical problem of normal cold storages (spending them).
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:49:14
The reason is, that during Recovery process (loading Recovery seed back to new Trezor when your got damaged or lost) user reveals words of his Recovery seed to (potentially compromised) computer, in random order.
So although there're still 24 factorial combinations (=620448401733239439360000 iterations), PBKDF2 *here* is adding another protection against bruteforcing.
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:11:22
I think we can handle that.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:48:27
Yes, I don't use any other wallets anymore (previously I've been Electrum user).
Even all payments made to buytrezor go directly to Trezor device...
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:31:11
You can, as far as it uses BIP39 wordlist and have correct checksum.
However it is strongly discouraged, user-generated checksums tend to be cryptographically weak. TREZOR-generated recovery seed has very good entropy; it combines internal HRNG and entropy provided by computer, so even if one part is weak, your seed is still safe.
Btw there's tool for checking that TREZOR generated seed using both entropy sources correctly: 
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:11:31
No, it's not a joke; I'm not sure if you read the news entirely.
We *do* offer money for finding security bugs with our Responsible disclosure program. Code reviewers can surely use such program in case they find anything wrong in the code.
We *don't* offer money for blindly putting GPG signatures for Trezor releases. Exactly because we don't want to attract people who don't have deep understanding of Trezor internals and source code.
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:09:23


We hope that code reviewers will do the first; watch our hands that we don't produce any code which is vulnerable or can be misused.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:12:58
You're right, I'll fix it ASAP. Thanks for reporting!

What's unsafe on loading unsigned transaction via USB?


How is this supposed to work? ofc I know yubikey, but for bitcoin wallet you need bi-directional communication.


bip38 is obsolete as it handles single private key only. The future is in bip32/bip44 and similar.

Trezor comes with its own webwallet at mytrezor.com. Although rather simple yet, it is very easy to use.
All security is managed by Trezor, so there's no more concern in using "web wallet", i.e. web interface for controlling Trezor.

It's pretty interesting to sit there and see how random visitors react to the information that fiat currency is not accepted here and they need to buy bitcoin first!

It may be as safe as using Trezor, at best. But the usability is really limited, because common user isn't maintaining offline computer just for case he will need to spend coins.
That's the purpose of Trezor; be *the* device, which is ready to safely spend coins, without unnecessary hassle.
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:25:08
Nice one, one biscuit for you sir @_date: 2014-12-18 00:28:00
Then just wait to Electrum devs until they release Electrum 2.0 officially. It should be by the end of year.
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:26:40
Not to mention that the mnemonic itself has huge entropy, so combining it with PBKDF2 makes it really resistent to bruteforcing attacks.
@_date: 2014-07-09 01:09:04
Actually scratches on the screen are so minor that they're barely visible. The photo of whole TREZOR after months in my pocket is here: 
Please note that this is one of first Metallics prototypes, where buttons don't have final finish.
I don't think screen protector will improve anything. Display itself is nested in case so it is protected from casual damage. Protector does not improve anything once you'll hit the screen by hammer ;-).
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:31:20
Hi Ken, which account structure did you choose for BIP32 paths? There has been discussion on bitcoin-dev about standardizing the structure to make HD wallets cross-software compatible. At least myTREZOR, Multibit, Armory and Electrum are going in this direction.
Unfortunately there's no BIP for this yet. Anyway, it would be awesome if you can contact us (slush and use the same structure to improve standardization across wallets!
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:34:08
The actual problem is when one entity can control TREZOR (its firmware) and software in your computer at the same time. In this case, attacker's firmware can expose API for leaking private keys to computer, and software on that computer can submit those keys over internet. At this moment, this is theoretically possible with TREZOR and myTREZOR (but far less likely than any other attack to any other wallet anyway).
For this reason we support independent wallet developers to integrate TREZOR, like Electrum did and Multibit HD is doing in final stage of development. When using TREZOR with any other wallet, not developed by SatoshiLabs, that theoretical attack described above won't work, because there's no single entity controlling both TREZOR and software on your computer.
Just bottom line; if you worry about this attack, you can use Electrum 2.0, which has TREZOR support, right now.
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:56:27
Yeah, there're hundreds of devices in the wild for few months already. However until today it was not possible to buy one directly, all of them were preorders.

@_date: 2014-12-03 18:07:38


Yes, Electrum 2.0 is in current git master. It should be released on the end of the year, but who knows...
@_date: 2014-06-26 01:42:46
Recovery seed generated by Trezor is actually much safer. Not only it uses more sources of entropy (using built-in chip + external entropy from connected computer), but it prints 12 words of recovery seed directly to display (see BIP39), so the recovery seed never leaves Trezor in electronic form. Paper and pencil FTW.


It is opensource, audited/auditable and digitally signed code:  . None of this is property of printer firmware.
That said, I don't think Entropy device itself can be easily rooted/misused. But its usage is depending on trust in 3rd party printing software, which is absolutely out of your control and which *is vulnerable* to the same attack vectors like any other desktop computer.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:11:59
slush checks every bit of coinbase, OP's proposed attack is nonsense.

Right now, in development version.
@_date: 2014-12-27 12:24:15
There's no permanent device ID in the protocol. There actually is one id which is getting updated by every device setup / recovery and it is just for a purpose of identifying device in the port, for client application (otherwise application won't make a difference between two devices loaded with the same seed). But we cannot track these ids and that id is not sent over the internet.

Please read this:  especially point 3, which explain why paper wallets are very dangerous for people who don't understand very detail of how bitcoin works.
I must say, (ehm, Trezor ad) that Trezor solves this, because Trezor's recovery seed is not a *single* private key. So with Trezor, you don't need to worry about bitcoin network internals, it manages change addresses and all other black magic in the way which prevents user mistake.
@_date: 2014-08-07 21:10:49
Brute forcing PIN is nearly impossible, because every failed PIN attempt increases delay between attempts exponentially.
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:15:58
When we offer money just for doing GPG signatures, then it won't have any weight. Anybody will be willing to do "gpg --clearsign trezor.bin" just to get few bucks.
What we're looking for are skilled developers who're interested in Trezor anyway, to let the community know that source codes are okay.
Of course they'll get money by using our Responsible disclosure program when they find something wrong in the code.

Exactly like this. There're no other information stored in Trezor than Recovery seed (24 english words) itself. As far as you still know your Recovery seed, you're safe.

Travelling is nice, but most people don't want to go through the trouble of buying expensive car. Is there any alternative?
Yes. You can build your own car by yourself, for example by using parts from scrapyard. If you're smart and handy, it will work. But there's a big chance that you'll screw up something and that vehicle will be uncomfortable or even dangerous.
The same is for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-04 19:12:51
Correct. Metallics were literally hand work and they were supposed to be a special edition for preorderists only.
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:27:48
Trezor never leaks private keys. So yes, if you really really want to know private keys, you must use some other application (like wallet32) which understands Recovery seed format (btw it is described in BIP39).
However, I strongly discourage to doing this, handling with private keys directly have various hidden security consequences. But for learning purposes - why not :).
I hope Trezor will work smooth for you!
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:50:59
Current TPM don't have support for ECDSA, so we're years from being able to sign bitcoin transactions there.
Even then, TPM can be able to sign transaction using internal private key, but without any feedback to user that it is signing what's expected, because there's generally untrusted computer between the user and TPM module.
@_date: 2014-08-02 15:26:59
It is already available here:  althought it is still lacking some features like device setup (user still need to use myTREZOR to generate recovery seed) and the UI is a bit nerdy.
It's time of vacations so I don't know when Electrum devs find a time to review the code and integrate it, but it should be in matter of weeks. Pull request to Electrum mainline awaiting review is here:

Actually having deterministic builds using Docker was a matter of few lines on Dockerfile. As an advantage, building is done on local computer, so it is yet another level of security.

Heh, that's the problem. If the cold storage is just a single private key, you load it to computer, do the payment and delete wallet, you're most likely screwed, because most of bitcoin wallets send change amount to *another* private key, not back to your paper wallet.
Of course this can be configured, but majority of people even don't know that this is happening. Paper wallets are definitely for geeks only.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:47:50
ad 2)
Electrum support has been done by friend of mine, and few people around me are happily using Electrum+TREZOR. However Electrum is missing some management tools like Trezor setup/recovery, so at least for these steps some other wallet is still necessary.
We have a (physical) meeting with Armory guys in few days about Armory+TREZOR integration. They are basically waiting to us because of multisig support. But things are going forward and I hope they'll be able to add TREZOR support quite soon, because they already done some parts of it.
ad 3,4) myTREZOR aims to common users, which are actually used to use some kind of web wallet, and which hesitate to install and use any desktop machine. Of course we're aware of possible availability problems and we're continuously improving that.
For example, myTREZOR itself is opensource ( the only proprietary part is Bits of proof server, but it can be replaced by any other backend providing some advanced blockchain API. At this time we're working on possibility that myTREZOR will be able to connect to any public block explorer (blockr.io, blockchain.info,...). Not only that anybody will be able to run their own instance on own server, but it will also open world of altcoins to TREZOR...
Because there's no "one size fits all", we fully understand that some power users simply prefer desktop wallet and they don't want to connect to any 3rd party service like block explorers. For this reason we cooperate with other wallet developers and I'm quite sure there'll be full support of TREZOR in Multibit HD or Armory quite soon...

@_date: 2014-08-02 20:42:30
There's how it works from user perspective:
Technically the firmware is digitally signed by us, and by uploading non-signed firmware, internal storage is erased, so hacker who'll try to upload his hand-crafted firmware will fail.
Plus our firmware is built deterministically from github sources, which mean that anybody with deep interest can check source codes, built its own version of firmware and compare its fingerprints, that our digitally signed firmware version is absolutely the same.
In that way, anybody can be sure he's not uploading any malware to the device.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:44:43
Trezor needs to know about the altcoin (not only name/shortcut, but also address type and other technical details). Right now Trezor supports BTC, LTC and NMC, but adding more coins is possible.
However adding altcoin support into unofficial Trezor firmware by altcoin developers will be trivial, so I expect they'll maintain firmware forks for altcoin users.

Wallet32 is pretty cool; I've been testing it for some time and right now it is my primary wallet on phone.
One of cool feature is that it uses the same standards like myTREZOR (specifically BIP39 and BIP44), so Wallet32 can be used as a software wallet for Trezor owners, who lost their device; Recovery seed produced by Trezor can be directly used in Wallet32 to recover all funds.

a) Its highly unlikely that the manufacturer even know from who do we buy our batches of microchips, so I'm not affraid of specific attacks against Trezor MCUs.
b) It is widely used chip of German company. The chance that there's generic backdoor is actually the same or lower than there's backdoor in Intel CPU of your netbook. Not talking about full stack of closed source firmwares (network card and wifi are very good examples) and closed source drivers of normal computer.


The point is that bugs of opensource software can be found and get fixed. Trezor stack is *very* tiny and it is possible to be audited even by single person, which is already being done by independent auditors.

However other wallets (including Multibit HD with SPV) are rolling out Trezor support, so using TREZOR without revealing any private information will be possible quite soon! I'm really looking for that because that's the way how decentralized project like bitcoins should work...

It can connect to computer or phone with USB OTG (Android 4+). Trezor uses BIP39 for its recovery seed ("paper wallet"). It doesn't talk to printers, because we think it's not necessary at all.

TREZOR itself is coin-agnostic. It's just up to controlling software (myTREZOR, Electrum, Armory, ...) if it indexes altcoin's blockchain. For example, Electrum-LTC 2.0 has both LTC and TREZOR support...
As I already mentioned above, we're working on myTREZOR so it will work with almost any block explorer instead of our current BTC-only backend. When this work is done, myTREZOR will be able to understand almost any altcoin...

I never really understood that "air gapped" thing. How does it improve anything? You still cannot check data transmitted over the air / QR code and unless you can calculate ECDSA in your head, you still need to trust the software that it does not do anything malicious, for example do not leak entropy over your "air gapped" connection.

The only moment where HRNG is involved is the process of generating the seed. Trezor is using entropy using internal HRNG and entropy provided by computer, and it is possible to check that both entropy sources have been used for the seed.

Although it is connected by USB, Trezor uses fairly limited protocol for sending unsigned transactions in and signed transaction out of the device. There's no way to export private keys to computer or sign the transaction without human interaction. Protocol design and source code is (will) be opensource so its easy to check that we're not lying.

Printers aren't supposed to be cryptographically sound devices. For example they use cheap power supplies, which produces periodic patterns emitting to device. Without proper regulation, such patterns are emited on USB port as well, which may (or may not) affect SRAM state on device power-on.
This is just first thing which come to my mind. I won't put my hand (and bitcoins) to the fire that there's not side channel attack similar to this. Again, you don't want rely on single source of entropy, because *when* researchers find any issue with it years ahead, users will be screwed.

Hi guys, firmware 1.3.0 is already on  for our testing purposes. myTREZOR itself does not have multisig interface yet, but you may check out greenaddress.it, multisig wallet which has TREZOR integration already done.
Disclaimer: Obviously, this is NOT a public release yet and it is for testing purposes only. Also I just hit some problems with GA.it and reported it to its developers, so GA.it integration is definitely not stable yet. We'll publicly release 1.3.0 once it passes our manual testing (automatic tests passed) and greenaddress.it integration will be flawless.
EDIT: Problem resolved, I need to go thru setup even for Trezor which is already initialized. In the right corner of the mnemonic passphrase there's a button to use the seed from the device instead.

Trezor Bridge, solving all known browser issues, is final and is being packaged for all platforms. It will be released soon after New year.


Thinner - agree. Smaller - actually feedback from our users is that display should be a little bit bigger and the form factor is unnecessary small.

TREZOR has three levels of security, two of them are optional:
a) Button protection - every outgoing transaction need to be checked by human on internal display and confirmed by hardware button press; this is required and prevents malware to steal your coins.
b) PIN protection - user will be asked for PIN once per device power-up (connecting to USB) to confirm that he's the real owner of device and not an unauthorized human - thief. The PIN is entered to computer in special, keylogger-proof way. Bad PIN attempts is exponentially increasing the delay between attempts so bruteforcing is impractical. PIN protection is optional but recommended.
c) Passphrase protection - this is for paranoid users and it is also optional, but not recommended for normal users. Every passphrase is correct, but generates completely different set of private keys ( providing plausible deniability for device owner. Attackers can apply rubberhose cryptoanalysis ( but they can never be sure that they have access to all passphrases for given device.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:07:18
Yes, myTREZOR uses recommended structure of external and internal (change) chains as described in BIP32, for improving user's privacy. However myTREZOR aims to ease of use, so we do hide change addresses and coin selection in UI.
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:17:01


You were probably refering some of backend outage, which has been fixed by us, so there was nothing necessary from user side. However, if we go bankrupt (which we don't plan anyway :) and when we turn off our servers, all mytrezor users can just choose another wallet supporting TREZOR natively or will install some BIP44 wallet to computer / smartphone and load Recovery seed there. No need to "understand how it works", all indexes and crypto magic is already included in any bip44 wallet.

* **Electrum 2.0** do this just now (you can build from github, many users actually use this, but if you're not willing to compile from source, you need wait to Electrum devs to build packages for you).
* **Multibit HD** beta supports it (still unreleased, ask Multibit HD devs).
* We have meeting with **Armory** devs on Friday, they plan to support it.
* **GreenAddress.it** supports it since TREZOR firmware 1.3.0 with Multisig support (will be released this week).
* BitPay's **Copay** devs contacted us and they integrate it.
* **Blockchain.info** contacted us some time ago, but I don't know more about their current plans.

Hi guys,
we're making first public demonstration of real TREZOR and myTREZOR wallet on Saturday in Berlin: 
Trezor is not a vaporware. It's piece of real and working hardware and visitors of BXB will see it in action.
I must admit that everything took longer than we expected, but it was definitely for good reason. When we started the project year ago, we didn't expect that we'll need to build complete infrastructure around TREZOR like our own (software) bitcoin wallet. Although TREZOR and myTREZOR is opensource so any other bitcoin wallet is welcome to support TREZOR, we decided to implement complete stack on our own to provide the best user experience for TREZOR owners. Which took its time.
@_date: 2014-08-02 17:59:43
Non-tech users are unable to prepare such setup and even tech savvy people screw it up time to time. Search Reddit for people who lost hundreds of BTC using paper wallets/BIP38 because they did not understand concept of change addresses...
Trezor solves all this even for common user, it is almost impossible to screw anything. It provides security for end users in a (small) box.

The consensus (not yet described in BIP, but already implemented at least in myTREZOR and Multibit) is:
**coin_type** is 0 for bitcoin, 1 for testnet and other numbers for other currencies to not mix pubkeys across chains while using the same wallet for more coins.
**reserved** is 0' (hardened derivation) for standard accounts. This is reserved for future use in advanced scenarios like 2of3 payments etc.
**account** (hardened derivation) has the same meaning as in your software.
**n** (public derivation) is also the same as in Wallet32.
Technically, to make Wallet32 compatible with other wallets, adding prefix m/0/0'/ to your software will make the job. It would be perfect to do it soon, until you'll have large userbase. Then the migration will be painful...
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:33:46

By using Trezor, you don't need to do all that boring stuff anymore. Trezor generates Recovery seed (24 english words shown on its display). If you write them to piece of paper and store them safely, you're done. Then you can use Trezor on daily basis, using for example our webwallet. It's not security issue anymore, because all security is outsourced to Trezor itself; there're no private keys on the computer or even in browser.
If the device is lost or broken, then you can recover your Recovery seed to another Trezor. Thanks to Recovery seed, you'll have the same private keys, the same transactions and bitcoin balance as on lost device.
Eventually you may want to load Recovery seed to another supported wallet (like Android's Wallet32) and transfer your coins to safe place, if you don't have another Trezor by your hand.

Yes, at least partially. Firstly, you can safely read short decrypted messages even on the display. Also as private keys never leave TREZOR,  attacker maybe can read your current messages, but by compromising the computer, he cannot decrypt your old messages or steal your keys for reading future communication...

The most important point is, that people using TREZOR don't need to trust us! That was one of TREZOR's goal, that the device is deterministic and anybody can check that it does what it should do.
Plus, for paranoid users, we do recommend to use some other wallet than myTREZOR (like Electrum right now, or Multibit HD and Armory in near future). In that case, even if TREZOR itself is malicious, thanks to Zero Trust Principle ( his coins are still safe!

No. There's PIN protection of the device, so only owner can sign transactions. Bruteforcing the PIN is impractical, there's exponential delay between every failed attempt (you'll wait a day between attempts after 20th failed PIN). Original owner can move his coins to another wallet in meantime.


Not at all. Device encourage you to make paper backup during its initial setup. When you lost your Trezor, you simply recover all private keys / transaction history / balance from that paper.

Trezor itself allow custom fees in transactions, it only displays warning if it thinks the fee is unusually high.
myTREZOR as web wallet based on Trezor offer fixed fees only. It aims to common users which usually don't have deep knowledge about bitcoin network and network fees, so not allowing custom (=zero) fees prevent them to screw up transaction; Multibit developers told me that majority of their support tickets are about "I set zero transaction and now my tx is freezed, what should I do?" We prefer seamless bitcoin experience over unpredictable behaviour and fixed fees are small part of such puzzle.
However advanced users are welcome to use other wallets with Trezor, for example Electrum allow custom tx fee and it has already experimental Trezor support...

Trezor can print its internal entropy to built-in display *before* it asks for computer entropy. So anybody who's really interested may rebuild bip39 recovery seed provided by Trezor on offline computer just by using this two pieces of random data.
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:54:08
TREZOR strongly discourage users to put Recovery seed online, it significantly increases security risk.
We considered adding shamir secret sharing scheme directly to TREZOR, but then we decided to focus on multisig feature instead, which has even better properties.
Main downside of SSSS is that you still need to put all shares to one place to be able to recover TREZOR and spend coins. Using more Recovery seeds as one multisig wallet eliminates that problem, because you don't ever need to put all shares together at one location...

Validating transactions which can be included into mining jobs take some time (up to few seconds). For this reason, when new block is found, the pool broadcast new job to miners as fast as possible, without any transactions inside. Thanks to this, miners are not wasting their hashrate by being idle. In meantime pool validates all pending transactions and re-broadcast another job when it is ready.
Although we're talking about savings fractions of second, there you can see this optimization really works.

Yes, you can use the same seed for normal blockchain as well for other altcoins, like Testnet. myTREZOR will use different private keys for every altcoin automagically thanks to BIP44 specification.

Well, it is "coin-agnostic" as far as it uses the same protocol as Bitcoin does. You're right, if there're some protocol changes, it won't work out of the box. Anyway, altcoin developers are welcome to release their own TREZOR firmwares, assuming that code changes are rather small...

Hi, I'm developer of Trezor, the hardware wallet, so I may be slightly biased. However I think the concept of Mycelium Entropy is broken by design, for these reasons:
* Device maybe generate paper wallet in safe way, however when user wants to spend it, he must load private key to untrusted device like Android phone. Below in this discussion I read that this is not a problem, because private key needs to be loaded just for a moment. It's a nonsense, because malware can sit on the computer/phone for years, waiting for that *second*, when you load private key there. *If* Entropy requires another trusted device for spending coins, *then* it is completely losing its purpose; you can generate paper wallet on such device as well, without using Entropy.
* **Entropy sends private key to online computer**. Nowadays printers which has USB support (required by Entropy) are nothing less than computers with full blown software stack. I randomly googled three of supported printers listed on Indiegogo: Brother MFC-8710DW, Epson WF-3520, HP Officejet Pro 8630. **All of them have ethernet or wifi or built-in HDD, storing queue of printed documents!** Those printers are running obsolete software (who regularly updates firmware of his printer?) without any security audit and nobody has a clue what this device is doing. I think *sending private keys to such device may be even worse than storing it on office computer* managed by sane user (no pirated software, firewall, regular updates etc).
* Relying on single source of entropy is generally bad practice. Computer engineers are cracking their heads about entropy for decades and there's no silver bullet yet. Device like Entropy should use more independent sources of randomness, however Entropy does not have anything more than built-in SRAM. Normal computer has more sources of entropy by default (mouse moves and CPU interruption in general, temperature sensors of CPU, traffic on nework card, ...) and even these sources are barely strong enough for serious cryptography.
I think those are serious points, limiting real usability of the device. Unfortunately, thanks to its design, there's no easy way how to fix it, without complicating the concept even more. For this reason I call it *broken by design* and I don't think device like this should be used by common users.

**Screen scratch** - Tested by wearing over two months in my pocket with keyring - passed. Now I tried to scratch protecting glass by keys and it has surprisingly high durability. The only real problem might be a high pressure at one point, like piercing it by ballpoint. Now I cracked the protective glass by high pressure of tool point, but the display under the glass still works...
**Screen bending/pressing test** - Plastic case do quite good work in absorbing press and lateral bending. I tried quite high pressure and it did not crack.
**Usb high voltage peak** - TREZOR passed standard  compliance tests like CE, so it can absorb high voltage peaks at least as any other electronic device.
**Magnet play** - No problem with magnetic fields.
**Drive over it** - I tried standing on one leg on the device. Passes without problem. As far as the pressure was higher than by car tire, I'm quite sure it will pass it as well. Anyway, I'll try it tomorrow.

Recovery seed is not supposed to be a brainwallet. I strongly recommend to write the seed down to piece of paper and there the length does not matter so much.
Btw words are still many times easier to remember or writing down than binary representation, at least there's "brain checksum" (you know when you made a mistake).
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:32:42
Actually even better than SSSS is Trezor multisig. There you can have multiple Trezors on different places, acting as single wallet. Benefit is that you never need to put SSSS fragments together on one place and load them to single Trezor, which may be another possible attack vector. You can consider single Trezors (and their recovery seeds) as "fragments of SSSS".
We're working on multisig support in Trezor.

I agree that Case is a nice piece of hardware. However what matters is that you own only one key of 2of3 multisig. Second is held by Case and third is held by Third Key Solution, BUT! Third Key Solution can (and will!) use that key on behalf Case.
I don't know exact processes there, but practically Case controls two of three keys by tricking Third Key Solution employees (that's basically their recover process when customer lose the device). 
Maybe I'm paranoid, but I lost over 3000 BTC exactly because of similar inside jobs of 3rd party companies ;-).
Case is saying that they'll offer option to not use Third Key Solution and customer will be able to backup the third key himself. Of course advanced users will do that, but that's not the default setup and the common users will be vulnerable to such "attack".
@_date: 2015-05-20 04:09:26

Sir, one cup of tea for you @_date: 2014-12-03 17:58:34
Well, TREZOR has API for loading custom seed. It is not exposed in myTREZOR because it definitely isn't feature for common users, but you can use command line for loading any seed you want...


For this reason, TREZOR doesn't rely on its HRNG. TREZOR always combines entropy from its own source and external entropy from computer (see  for algorithm), so even if attacker weaken HRNG in TREZOR itself, your coins are still safe.
@_date: 2014-08-11 09:55:27
It does allow, it's just not recommended / for experts. Actually the way Trezor generates entropy is very secure, because it combines entropy of more sources (device itself and computer) and I don't see any reason for generating seed in another way.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:58:09
Ah, now I see that **you** are the author of mnemonic code. I'm very sorry, I overlooked it :-).
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:05:23
Correct. Recovery seed used by Trezor is not a single private key. Actually it is something from which Trezor can generate unlimited amount of private keys, in deterministic way. This means, that as long as you have the same Recovery seed, any Trezor (or any other software supporting this type of seed like Android's Wallet32) will generate the same private keys over again.
So during the transaction, Trezor can send change amount to new private key, because he knows that this private key can be re-generated at any time.
This concept is generally called "hierarchical deterministic wallets" or "HD wallets" and its technical specification is in BIP 32: 
The way how to transfer set of words from Recovery seed is defined in BIP 39: 
Hope this helps :-)
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:05:48
a) Electrical part was the easiest thing on the whole project. We have done PCBs back in June or so.
b) You NEED to have a display. Wallet without the display cannot be secure enough, because you don't know what you're going to confirm by the button press.
c) The biggest challenge of the wallet is its integration to the bitcoin ecosystem. There's no precedence for such hardware wallet yet, so we need to think about everything. Defining the protocol, handling with the keys/seed, protecting by PIN and passphrase, streaming unsigned transactions to the device, integrating with desktop software. I believe that once we'll publish all our research and source code, it become trivial to make another wallet, because they save a year of R&amp;D.
z) If you think it's so easy, just do it.

Case wallet is more or less mobile phone (GSM + battery + camera + display), without ability to make a call :).
In my opinion Case wallet is not anyhow better than using normal Android phone with (for example) GreenBits application for 2of2 multisig. The practical differences are neglible, it's probably much cheaper and available right now.
Of course I would recommend Mycelium + TREZOR for not depending to 3rd party (in both Case or GreenBits setup, you don't own all keys, so you don't own bitcoins).
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:55:57


None of above at this moment. We still wanna keep things simple and we're quite happy with current design. Touchscreen would be nice, but it would actually rise the price, which goes against our plans.

What product would you choose if you'd need to buy Wifi router?
* Router A, Some Features, $60, 20W consumption
* Router B, Same Features, $15, 40W consumption
Now I pointed it directly, but the key is that common user have NO idea what's common power consumption of such device and he would not notice it's higher than in competetive product. Even if he notices, he does not do the math that the more expensive device pays off the price difference in just a year (sort of).
@_date: 2014-09-02 13:27:21
Interesting, but not too much dangerous in real life. Trezor does not touch seed / private keys before you provide valid PIN / passphrase. So basically only Trezor owner can *try* such attack, and not somebody who found/steal it.

* We discussed the way Cryptstosteel could be locked so the owner will see the device has been tampered (when the lock/seal is damaged), but I don't know if this is included in final design.
In any way, doing a hole using drilling machine thru the Cryptosteed and adding lock will do the job as well :-).
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:32:09
In current design, one Cryptosteel can contain unlimited amount of private keys. That's definitely superset of original design, where only one private key could be stored. HD wallets are the future and Cryptosteel perfectly fit the needs of modern wallets for their backup.

Ooops. How is Trezor connect more proprietary and less interoperable *protocol* than BitID, except that it's ours and not yours? Nicolas, this is pretty poor argument as both solutions solves basically the same issue in same way, the differences are more or less cosmetics (like we designed the protocol in mind that we can use display for "visual challenge") :-).
Even more, TREZOR Connect / BitID is something lying outside *core* implementation of the wallet, so this is completely irrelevant to discussion about the security design.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:26:42
Sure, different segments. Then I don't understand your continuous bashing of our solution like your yesterday's PR article. Your current products aims to lower segment, our to higher segment and that's fair.
Anyway, in the scale of security/high price and usability/low price, I see TREZOR on the left side, mobile phone on the right side and Ledger somewhere in the middle.
The aim of TREZOR as the first HW wallet was to fill the segment in the opposite of the low-cost (mobile app) solution, so the low price was not it's primary goal. There's still huge segment of non-tech people with large bitcoin savings who simply don't want to fiddle with USB linux setup, and they prize their time and peace of mind much higher than $119 per hardware wallet.

Cryptosteel uses BIP39 ( for it's backup format, so it's compatible with many Bitcoin HD wallets like TREZOR, Multibit HD, Mycelium, Electrum, Ledger and others.
I had a chance to hold Cryptosteel in my hands. The feel is very solid and I think Cryptosteel's concept is pretty smart. I'll definitely use it as backup solution for my personal TREZOR.
Disclaimer: I'm not financially connected to Cryptosteel. We in SatoshiLabs just helped the product design (especially that BIP39 part) and I'm fan of the project.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:38:36


Yes, of course they're secure. But it depends if their security solves, what's the real problem. There's still custom code running inside. Code, which cannot be opensourced because of NDA to chip developers. Many researchers peer reviewed Trezor's code - who peer reviewed Ledger's code? "Security" is pretty complicated stuff and simple claim "it's secure because it uses secure elements" is naive.
Anyway, even Ledger understood that their lack of screen and buttons is a problem, otherwise they would not develop new product :). They even plan to include ARM processor. So don't take their PR articles trying to bash their competition too seriously :-).

You cannot be sure, of course. But using that tool, you can check that Trezor uses *at least* computer provided entropy, so it is *at least* as strong as private keys generated by computer.
In reality entropy provided by TREZOR+computer is much stronger than this.

Exactly. Only few paranoid users will do this. Majority of people will simply load paper wallets generated by Entropy to normal computers, because they don't know how to prepare secured environment. If they knew, they would generate private keys using that environment. There's no need of Entropy device for them. For others, using Entropy is just a false feeling of security. Which is very dangerous.


You assume that the printer is doing what's supposed to do. Even HP warn its users about risks resulting from smart printers:
*Citation: "If your printer has an internal drive, it can store print jobs, scans, copies and faxes containing sensitive information. This information can fall into the wrong hands if someone steals the printer or when you get rid of your old one without properly erasing data."*
Again, why to use specialized device for generating secured private key, when you immediately send it to such untrusted environment like office printer.


There're many $1 chips passing NIST tests. Most of them are used by remote controllers in cars. In Bitcoin, you stand against the best of best hackers in the world, which have unlimited time and power to crack data stored in blockchain. You **want** to combine entropy from various sources and do not depend on single source of entropy.

Fake words are still used for seeds shorter than 24 words (24 - seed_length = fake_words_count).
Fake words does not protect the seed well when multiple recovery is done, so instead of rely on fake words, myTREZOR now produces seeds of default length 24 words where no fake words are used during recovery.

My concern with Ledger Nano is that it creates the feel of false security. People don't understand all concepts and security concerns and they feel that having hardware wallet is enough. No, it's not enough if they're using it wrong.
"Using it wrong" is pretty easy if you need extra steps for doing the trasanction safely (like confirming transaction template on another independent computer). In my opinion, secure hardware wallet need to be idiot-proof to minimize human error in daily usage and yet achieve maximum security.

Of course, *if*.
I'm not saying that multisig is worse than plausible deniability. I'm saying that both have different use cases, and with TREZOR you can use both separately, or together. Ledger is saying that multisig is much better than plausible deniability, which is clearly wrong because you cannot compare apples and oranges.
But I understand your PR department, they must write something and Ledger does not have plausible deniability feature, so writing an article picturing plausible deniability as irrelevant feature sounded like a good topic :-).

I'm not aware of that, but there's actually very few situations you really need that.
The only scenario is that you already have existing private key. Then it is recommented to create a new seed and resend coins there.
If you for some reason want to avoid HD wallets and you want store single private key only, then you can put letters in random order and handle them as a brainwallet (i.e. sha256(random_characters)).

You get the point correctly. Current design is pretty flexible and you can imagine variety of usecases.
* BIP39 mnemonic (which is, anyway, equivalent to xprv and there're opensource tools to do such conversion).

There's many point of views how to compare those products. There're few of them:
a) If you strictly compare amount of $$$ needed to extract private data from them, then secure element is much better.
b) But the philosophy of devices are different. One product builds security on its secure element, another product is trying to make physical attacks irrelevant. As it has been stated above, you can still be able to extract private data from the device in lab, but you still cannot misuse these data because you don't know passphrase which encrypts them.
c) Another point of view is also it's opensource/closedsource. You can compare it as to iPhone/Android. One product is closed source and provide some specified features. Another product is fully opensourced and can be easily extended in functionality like hard disk encryption (such demo is already implemented in  or secure messaging where messages can be decrypted only in built-in display, using that for authentication device for SSH sessions (in development) etc. However, some customers still prefer Apple for their reasons :-).

We had concerns about GreenAddress security model and TREZOR integration and Martin tried to reach you on email many times. To be more specific, our main issue with GreenAddress and TREZOR is that GA generates seed in the browser and then load it to TREZOR. It is absolutely no go from security perspective, TREZOR is designed that the private data should be generated inside and never leave the device. You did not fix that although you've been warned by us multiple times. For that reason we don't want to propagate using GA with TREZOR. This is nothing personal and it may change if such major security issues will be addressed.

When done right, the overhead for mining in consumer-grade electronics is neglible. There's some general purpose chip in such device anyway (for serving mining jobs from the manufacturer's pool), price of the chip itself is more or less $2, it does not need any cooling and there's a power regulator anyway because of the main electronics.
So actually such implementation have some advantages over "standard" mining operation, where you have a huge overhead because of cooling, because of added electronics which is used purely for the mining etc.
Of course you need to sell milions of electronic devices to cover hashrate of middle-sized mining operation in old factory, but if 21Inc works with large electronics manufacturers, this is clearly doable.
And yes, it's me :-).

Trezor is not less "trustless" than Ledger, actually the oposite is true. Trezor can be used in the same multisig setup as well (to be specific, Trezor works with GreenAddress right now, but we do not propagate this solution as we have some real concerns about GreenAddress attitude).
As sipak stated, Ledger is closed source, they're only "open specification". Trezor has been peer reviewed by many specialists, including Ledger developers. Who peer-reviewed Ledger's internals? To be more direct, having secure element is not a silver bullet - there is still custom code running inside, and this code can have bugs like any other solution. Secure element is more or less about extracting private keys once you have physical access to the device. For that reason Trezor does not rely on physical security, but it build its design on BIP39's passphrase. So even extracting private data from the device, you cannot spend coins without the knowledge of passphrase.
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:38:42


Yes, Lawrence disabled PIN protection on purpose for his demonstration. In this case, on devices with PIN disabled, you can just send coins out of the wallet without any further protection, just by having physical access to it. Of course it is highly discouraged setup, but it may be useful for setups where physical security is not a problem.


Hundreds thousands, thousands or hundreds, it actually does not matter. If you have physical access + PIN, you can send coins directly. If you have physical access and no PIN, you won't get a single signature.
TREZOR philosophy and security does not stand on the idea that the device is a fortress. If you have physical access, time and motivation, you'll get private data from any device, secure elements or not. The beauty of TREZOR is that it is completely irrelevant, because of Recovery seed, passphrase and PIN protection.
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:54:00
Definitely depends on your expectations. If you only want to store them for future generations, paper wallet with geobackups (multiple locations) will do the job, and it's for free. Or  if you want disaster-proof backup :-).
If you want to use these coins and you're a security expert, you can follow many howtos for creating secure computer for bitcoin wallet. It will be for free while using old laptop, except your time and some nerves that you've done that right.
Or you just buy TREZOR and you have proven cold storage with ability to spend coins in safe way. It's philosophy is that private keys never leave the device (except the initial paper backup), so you can manage your coins even on untrusted computer.

There're enough letters to cover 99.99%+ seeds generated (24 words of BIP39 seed).

Don't touch wallets which does not use RFC6979 yet (
RFC6979 is used for generating deterministic signatures, where no entropy source is needed. This means that users can check the signature looks like it should by signing the same data and the same private key in another software.
While not using deterministic signatures, it is impossible to be sure the software is not leaking private information through signatures or even it is using low entropy like blockchain.info did few weeks ago.

You can use Electrum with TREZOR right now, to not leak xpub to server. However, in my opinion, the difference between leaking list of addresses (like Electrum does) and xpub (as myTREZOR does) is very tiny. For some reason Peter is okay with Electrum and on war campaign against Trezor.
My point in that discussion is that bitcoin is not anonymous anyway, even by using hardcore solutions like Armory. Peter's arguments sounds like Bitcoin has near ideal privacy and myTREZOR is breaking it by using some dangerous patterns. He even told that we were obliged to not launch SO BADLY designed product to public, which is definitely not true.
If somebody wants to stay private, just using *any* bitcoin client does not help much. So what's the point to blame just myTREZOR?

PIN protection is already fixed in github and it will be released very soon. It is still theoretical bug, but we appreciate feedback of researchers and we've implemented their recommendation.
Side channel attack to TREZOR makes no sense for simple reason. You still need hundred thousands of signatures done by the device *at least* to even try it. But, TREZOR is designed in the way it won't do a single signature for you unless you know the PIN. If you know PIN, you don't need to perform side channel attack anymore, because then you can just withdrawn bitcoins.
But it may be a nice homework.
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:36:02
At this point, Ledger is not a competition for TREZOR because of missing display, buttons and closed sources. Ledger cannot be as easy and as secure as TREZOR because of this, and I'm sure the peace of mind given by TREZOR design is worth the extra premium in price. Maybe it also depends on amount people are going to store on such device.
This is really to another discussion. I did not want to do public comparsion of other products on the market, but because others started to do this already, maybe I'll join :-).

"Without the PIN" - but PIN is essential part of TREZOR security. It's like "let your doors open and let me show I can rob you in a minute". Without the PIN you can just create spending transaction without actually hacking anything, and thats what I'm saying again and again - that attacks on side channels are anything than practical.
Anyway, I told that physical security way never the main purpose of the device. However I'm sure you cannot steal coins from TREZOR with PIN and passphrase enabled (thats how people with serious money on it use TREZOR).

NPAPI was perfect for its purpose and I'm quite sad this is being removed. I'm pretty sure people want to use browsers instead of desktop applications. So the second best solution is to do standalone daemon listening on local port for commands from the browser. That's what trezord does:

Before blockchain.info, there was issue with weak entropy in Android stack. You can check wallet sources quite easily, you can compile it on your own, but it is very hard to check that also all underlying libraries of Android software stack (12 milion lines of source code:  are safe from all attack vectors. 
But *not* using entropy for signing at all (RFC6979) is the only way you can be sure signatures are not leaking private information.
@_date: 2015-01-11 23:08:34
Well. Nothing will stops you. But TREZOR, without a PIN and passphrase, won't let you get any useful data out of it.

No, they're generated during setup by user.


It is all opensource ( with deterministic build; power user can recompile it from sources, check firmware fingerprint and confirm that our builds do what's expected to do.
Device is also fully deterministic, so after some basic tests users can confirm that there's no private data leaked in signatures etc.


Random generator is used only during initial setup, and entropy is combined from computer and from device. So even if one source is weak, everything is still perfect.
Signing itself is fully deterministic using rfc6979 so there's no RNG involved and attacks like repeating R value (like recent blockchain.info hack) are physically impossible.

I'm not aware of any ready-to-go solution, but actually you can do it yourself, if you have little programming skills.
1. Run Insight node locally.
2.  is a small python script which can crawl thru given BIP32 xpub using Insight instance and give you all used addresses, tx history and balances.
3. You can modify that into small standalone webserver, which provides desired user interface.

Server is used to index blockchain, and there're some corner cases when it has issues and indexing is slowing down significantly; that's what we're working on, to prevent slow responses and instability.
However, the data discovered/indexed since first attempt to load mytrezor are persisted across multiple connections. So, if you have problem with connection and you need to reload the page, you'll get data once they're processed by server since your first request.

Yes, we're having difficulties with the backend, and we're solving them right now. We originally outsourced it, which was huge mistake, and we're working on replacement. Actually the backend is the only thing not done by us, and the only thing which is problematic.
Also ask your favorite wallet developers to support TREZOR directly. It's not true that Trezor *need* myTREZOR to work, but other teams were unable to integrate it yet.
@_date: 2015-01-10 18:14:56
No, that's not the point. There's no problem with wire protocol, USB HID is quite fine. The problem is that TREZOR cannot act like braille keyboard, because operating systems does not provide blockchain access to stock braille keyboards...

12 words are definitely enough for common use, but TREZOR Recovery process rely on entering words over keyboard (in random order). In this case, if the computer is infected / backdoored, entering 24 words in random order has much higher protection than using 12 words only.
However there's no need to drop old seeds using 12 or 18 words only. We just simplified setup to be more straightforward, and as everything in TREZOR, we want to achieve maximal security by default.

You're assuming wrong. Hash is not calculated by Trezor, ofc it is calculated by build scripts.


TREZOR firmware builds are fully deterministic, like Bitcoin-qt. Soon we plan to ask peer reviewers to sign firmware hashes with their GPG, and publish them on independent site. Even today anybody can do this. Yet correct, it's not here right now "out of the box".


No, read the source before criticize us.


The same is Electrum, even SPV wallets like Multibit have privacy issues. This is hardly problem of TREZOR and we're looking forward to Trezor support in Armory, which will provide full privacy for users.

Shortly after TREZOR clone appear, we decided to change licence from GPL to Ms-RSL (which is anyway the same licence Mycelium is using).
Explanation is simple - we're aware that this won't stop Chinese to copy our product, but this step gives a sign that we're not happy with it. This is more about a moral urge to their customers.
There'll be official announcement on our site soon. Yes, we needed to put a commit back to history because of this, but still only text of licence changed and it is legally permitted to re-licence product retrospectively like this. We purposedly choose to change licence on commit *after* it was forked by chinese.

My previous posts does not mean we're taking it easy. We periodically improve our crypto lib in this area. Still, my point is valid (you need physical access and tons of real signatures to make it happen).
I just want to calm down people, because many users think that side channel attack is something very easy and straightforward to do.
@_date: 2015-01-10 21:25:54
It is actually not *that* hard to run myTREZOR locally and let it connect to remote BOP server. I see, not user-friendly, but quite nice solution for power user who want to put hands on it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:10:14
Side channel attacks are a nice buzzword, but it isn't a real attack vector in TREZOR case.
You realistically need millions (okay, maybe a bit less, but not much) operations to collect enough data for any further analysis, collected *during* physical access to the device.
TREZOR is protected by PIN and passphrase, so when attacker get physical access to the device, he cannot really sign any transactions to collect any data for side channel attack. So it is extremely unlikely than attacker will be able to meet these conditions. And if somebody already have TREZOR and PIN and passphrase, side channel attack is not necessary anymore ;-).

This block of source code tells you that Trezor does not rely on it's internal HRNG during generating the seed, but it actually mix entropy from more sources; from internal HRNG and from computer.
Just for your curiosity, this is the only part of code where randomness is used (for handling private keys) in the whole codebase. Other parts of firmware are fully deterministic and cannot be cheated by weaken HRNG.
@_date: 2016-03-17 11:07:05


Yes, exactly like this, to avoid attacks vector of malicious HRNG or entropy provided by computer.

This should not be necessary, but yes, there were some issues with backend. I suppose those problems will disappear with Bitcore backend. Btw, you don't need to Forget trezor, F5 should fix the list in the same way.


You already confirm the TX on TREZOR using trusted display &amp; button, so this is unnecessary step in our usecase.


TREZOR lock itself (clear PIN &amp; passphrase) in 15 minutes of inactivity (TREZOR display goes blank at this moment). Mytrezor is still loaded, but attacker cannot do any transaction. However, having the option to "forget" trezor in mytrezor on timeout seems like a nice feature to implement. Thanks for input!


PIN is asked anytime mytrezor (or other wallet) connect to TREZOR. Entering PIN multiple times during one session has no security benefits but reduces UX.
Displaying balances in local currency (and remembering that choice) is in roadmap, should be there very soon.
Thank you for your feedback once again, I'll discuss your post with mytrezor developers!

There're two very specific problems which our customers are facing:
a) Browsers are dropping support for plugins. We're working on Trezor Bridge, which enables integration with websites without need of direct support by browsers. This is literally few days before release and our beta testers are already using it.
b) BoP implementation is quite unstable and automatic restarts are necessary, which turns into lower uptime of mytrezor site. Unfortunately this is getting worse as more and more people is using TREZOR everyday and we're solving this by writing our own opensource implementation where we'll be more flexible in fixing all issues.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:51:24




Plugin is not a part of TREZOR, we never promised that everything around will be opensource. We put a lot of effort into it (actually a year of full time development), because it was bleeding edge technology (or do you know any other USB token talking directly to web page?) and we don't want to just push sources to our competitors, especially when they're just copying everything what we publish.
Actually Plugin was the only closed source part, and it is being replaced by opensource Bridge, so what's your problem?
Btw please stop being asshole and if you copy paste "official answer" to the top post, copy full text, not just a part which fits your agenda.

Uh, do you know about our deterministic firmware builds and digitally signed firmware? Users definitely don't need to fiddle with USB linux setup. If he buy product from untrusted source (which is not recommended for normal users anyway), he can easily reflash firmware from trusted source and everything should be okay. Well, there's still a neglible chance, that there's hardware backdoor, but you still need cooperative computer to actually use that backdoor (to, for example, resend private keys over the internet).
Anyway, how can be anyone sure they're using original Ledger and not a chinese copy using cracked ARM processor *pretending to be* a Ledger? :-) Sometimes I'm surprised which unlikely and crazy attack vectors can be thought about...

For that reason we send all TREZOR (and now Cryptosteel) units with tracking number, which is more expensive, but there're better chances to find lost packages faster.

Actually the fact that something is not implemented yet does not mean it's vendor lockin. Everything is opensourced and independent on our services and servers. Anyway, Mycelium implemented key derivation scheme from TREZOR Connect to their BitID implementation exactly because they plan to support Connect in future :-). So please don't be too quick with your judgements.


For BitID or TREZOR Connect you need an access to private keys. There's no more magic than this behind Connect / BitID and I would appreciate if you would stop spreading misinformations about this. You can achieve this even now with our compatible wallets:

Well, you can eliminate this by generating mnemonic in TREZOR by using python-trezor (see cmdtr.py reset_device command, it enables displaying TREZOR's entropy on the display) and write down computer provided entropy and TREZOR's entropy down to the paper. Then use mnemonic_check.py and enter both entropies there. If produced mnemonic is the same, you can be sure TREZOR isn't using any malicious algorithm which weakens your mnemonic. Then discard the mnemonic (which is now known to the computer) and do the same again, without using mnemonic_check.py, so computer does not know the mnemonic sentence :-).
The reason why this is not a default for users is that this is a bit... nerdy :-).

"Actually the fact that something is not implemented yet does not mean it's vendor lockin."

Well, I got your message, but I don't agree on significance of such difference. Most of users don't know / don't care about privacy, then it makes no difference. And it's just about a line of text in Armory that "if you want to keep your transactions in secret, (re)initialize TREZOR in Armory and never use it with another wallet".
That said, I'm very happy with all features BIP32 brings to the world, and I don't think all this should be sacrificed because of this specific issue, which cannot be solved easily by users who care about privacy.

TREZOR Metallic was on preorder for 3 BTC - and it was on sale even when exchange rate was over $300. Current price is pretty steep, I agree, but we don't want to upset preorderists where many of them paid even more.
Classic TREZORs are for normal price, so I don't see any problem.
Some limited ETH support is in progress by 3rd party developers. I hope we'll be able to provide more information soon.

 together with deterministic firmware builds gives quite high confidence that there's genuine firmware running inside TREZOR.
TREZOR is using HID protocol, like your mouse or keyboard. It's really not very likely that your keyboard is actively sending what you're typing over Internet, right?


It's open hardware:  . There's nothing more than widely used ARM microchip and other well known parts.

The problem is called "trust". Of course you can ask somebody to laser-engrave your keys to plate of steel, but you need to tell him your seed or private key first.
With Cryptosteel, you don't need to trust anybody. You just order one package and you can encode your seed by yourself, by composing set of letters into your backup seed.

Signalling is based on miner voting, so deployment of 0.12.1 affects only hashrate which vote for Core.

It must run as a server because of browser security model. Please set alias of localhost.mytrezor.com to localhost in your resolv.conf, this is whitelisted by extension and bridge.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:46:57
It should be pretty straightforward to write some boilerplate code using python-trezor, providing bridge between the hardware and Core's RPC. Technically it is doable, I did not dig enough into recent Core codebase to learn how hard it would be.

Pool is now signalling CSV for Classic, too. After some communication with Classic devs they confirmed they're going to release client with CSV soon.

Actually there's many BIP39-compatible wallets. TREZOR is one of them, then Mycelium, Multibit HD, Copay etc. If Breadwallet does not accept bip39 seed because it expects only 12 words, then it is clearly Breadwallet issue and should be reported, because it breaks bip39 specification.
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:45:00
Do you see any errors in JS console or in apache access log? Most likely there's something you don't handle well. I always tested bitcore on default paths and I never had any issue.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:12:21
I need more information to actually help you. There may be a lot of reasons, for example SSL issues; bitcore must run over https otherwise it won't work due to browser security policies) etc. AFAIK bitcore does not run over https by default so I guess this may be the most common trouble people will find.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:09:04
Voting for features will be possible with BIP9. We first need to agree on that; Pool isn't one who's blocking that feature, but maybe not *everybody* wants that for whatever reason. Also this is expected by BIP9, too. Otherwise the threshold would be 100%, not 95% ;).
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:48:43
PIN entry is not less secure, when you do not reuse digits; something which is discouraged even in the UI (it shows PIN with repeated numbers as weak).
That said, I think harder method of entering pin/passphrase (via two-button interface vs. keyborad/mouse) lead to entering easier/shorter pins and passphrases, because users are generally lazy. So I count the ease of UI as important when it comes to security, and that's why we do it on TREZOR as we do.

We didn't make anything by mistake. We just release new stratum nodes which signals for Segwit. There's no point to start signalling at exact block height. those early votes simply does not count yet.

Ghash.io didnt own the hashrate. Miners simply moved out of the pool. Today it is different story.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:09:06
Yes, you're correct. The max block size are data without witness.
About the need of coding it; BU devs told me in person that they manually remove Segwit from all merges from Core...
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:21:41
You really think that if Segwit will activate, Bitcoin Unlimited disapear? I don't think so. They'll just stop removing Segwit patch from their source code.

Which wallet did you use for sending such transactions? Seems like some old software which still use fixed (and low) fees. Anyway, your coins aren't lost. They'll get confirmed eventually or the tx will be cancelled and you'll see the balance back on your old wallet.
@_date: 2016-11-15 17:06:37
As stated, miners can choose which versions they mine. Mining for segwit is not a pool-wide setup.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:23:13
I disagree. You cannot vote for 1MB and bigger blocks at the same time ("Core" vs "BU"). But you can vote for Segwit and BU.
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:23:48
Technically it is doable. You can have both Segwit and bigger blocks as they don't collide on code level in any way.
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:48:43
Not yet. We have some prototypes, but hardware development is always long run.
@_date: 2016-11-21 18:31:13
Currently we run only Core nodes in production, but we've tested Unlimited, so we're ready to switch if Unlimited will have real chance to be activated.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:30:27
I agree displaying error  in GUI might be disturbing. Unfortunately its more a problem of too strict error handling in the client than the miners. Using "undefined" flags as defined in BIP9 is pretty common (Bitcoin Classic, ...) and will be even more widespread in the future.

Firstly, TREZOR does pretty fine on keychain. I'm stress-testing my TREZOR (one of first ever created) and I have no issue at all. The same reported other people. Generally I can say people are too much affraid, the device is pretty robust :).
However, yes, we plan screen protector for keychain for version 2. The reason is that v2 display is much bigger, so more fragile to scratches and other damage. We also plan some premium version, but right now we focus to "standard" version to be released.
@_date: 2016-11-11 19:10:45
I know that, still the centralization is getting even worse by time. And I'm not proposing any specific solution, I just think it's an interesting topic which is being ignored so far. I think there may be long time solutions which actually doesn't waste anybody's investment, yet it will stop the progress in centralization.
@_date: 2016-11-22 19:48:07
Of course I'm glad you're happy with the first version. We're just trying to make it even more awesome by allowing independent developers to use the platform for non-bitcoin use. Think of smart contracts, much more altcoins or even completely unrelated use case like encrypted hard drives. That's impossible to achieve with the first version as we already see us, the dev team, as bottleneck for decentralized development.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:30:23


If it is so easy, why nobody is doing that.


Sure. That's the point. Nothing (incl. competetive products) is perfect, you just want to make it hard enough for thieves. In the end, from physical security side, nothing will ever be easier than $5 wrench attack. Even 4094-bit RSA won't protect you ;-).
@_date: 2016-11-21 13:46:23
Need to be clarified: That voting options mentioned in article are still in development. Right now, Segwit is only signalized for miners who vote for Core blocks. Later it will be possible to vote for bigger blocks and for Segwit at the same time (which makes a lot of sense).

Rebuilding pool infrastructure need some effort and service restarts, so we won't make it until it is clear BIP101 is going to happen. Ofc we're ready to switch.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:43:54
This. Currently ~10% of our miners opted in to vote for bip101. Its completely their decision.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:51:16
This mechanism is used by Slush Pool to let miners vote for bip101. We might add voting for bip100 as well, but we need working implementation first. Letting miners to vote for non existing solution is dangerous.

@_date: 2017-11-15 06:29:11
Well, actually mining of BTC during the weekend was not *so* unprofitable as many people expect - just check block value of Slush Pool blocks during that period.
It mostly depends on which BCH/BTC exchange quote you pick, but from my perspective, it was more rational to mine BTC (which was even more profitable to mine than during standard period of time) than betting on pump&amp;dump on BCH.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:43:54
At this time, pool just offer voting for miners. It does not run XT (and probably won't in the future, if hardfork will come, we'll probably use Core with bigblock patch).

If I can speak for TREZOR, hardware is opensource and anybody can pretty easily check that the hardware is real (many people really open the casing to check what's inside).
Then you have firmware, which is distributed by us and digitally signed. You can build your own from github.com/trezor/trezor-mcu and check that your binaries are the same as those distributed.
Many people do this research on their own and they would be *very* loud if the distributed firmware would be different than one build from the open sources.
Shortly said, we designed the wallet in the way it make hard even for us to distribute malicious code to users, because whole process is as open as possible - and there are real people watching our hands.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:47:03


If you know how to use live-cd on disconnected computer and you don't care about doing this procedure everytime you want to spend your coins, HW wallets are probably not for you.
That's hovewer not the case for normal users.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:32:24
The best solution is to buy two devices and open one of them to physically check what's inside. I highly doubt (at least at this stage), that FBI agents will secretly de-solder the chip and replace it with malicious one (mind that it would need to be chip designed especially for this purpose).
Also mind that TREZOR uses ultrasound welding so even opening the case without destroying it is quite problematic. So we're talking more about completely counterfeit device, which is yet another level :-).
@_date: 2016-02-16 09:59:34
Actually metal/glass (display) is much more fragile than plastic/glass, because the plastic absorb a lot of vibrations from the hit.
We made a "destruction derby" of TREZOR before it hit the market - and it is *really* hard to destroy. Actually after 1.5 years on market we don't have any evidence of a single piece physically damaged by common usage. I'm still using my device which I threw against concrete wall, let it fall from 3rd floor or drown in Club Maté (
Long story short: You definitely won't break TREZOR by "one drop" ;).
Disclaimer: I'm from TREZOR team.
@_date: 2017-04-21 19:05:59


No, it's wrong. Please understand that hardware wallet does-not-reveal-private-keys-to-computer. Everything is signed *inside* the wallet and thanks to display you know what exactly you're signing.
You cannot do this with paper wallet.
Multisig is fine, for advanced use cases or when more people is involved. That's how you can use hardware wallets, too :-).
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:07:44
No, you don't need to make choice. Today, you can freely exchange Trezor Wallet (formerly myTREZOR), Mycelium, Electrum and maybe Multibit. All will see the same balance and transaction history for seed generated with TREZOR.
Anyway, it is documented as BIP44.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:46:10
There's difference in "exposing private key to computer" and "involve a computer". For using hw wallets, you still have to use computer, but you don't leak any private key into it. So you can use old unpatched machine with WindowsXP on it. See the difference?
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:39:43
Oh, my bad.
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:49:47
That's actually not necessary. There's many people auditing new firmware releases which would be loud enough if there something bad happen in the process (I speak for TREZOR).
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:42:19
Most of people can't, but many of them do. Distributing manipulated hw would be our suicide.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:25:28
There's nothing new in such paper, it describes plain old man in the middle attacks. Stratum is application protocol like HTTP is. You can just add SSL/TLS layer to Stratum as HTTP is doing with HTTPS.
Some miners already do that. No need for protocol change.
@_date: 2017-04-22 19:48:36
AFAIK all hardware wallets produce deterministic signatures, so they don't need RNG for signing.
TREZOR have possibility to audit the seed generating process though, so there's no need to generate seed outside.
@_date: 2016-02-22 10:39:49
Bootloader is opensource too. Anyway, it is pretty easy to dump bootloader from the device and read instructions manually to see there's no backdoor, as have been already done by some researchers. Try that with ROM of your phone ;).

TREZOR generates paper wallet on its own. Long-term storage does not depend on flash memory.


Firstly you must expose your private keys to your computer/phone when you generate it, and then when you want to spend it. Not in case of hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-22 10:41:41


Not true. You can load your own firmware into Trezor, bootloader will just display warning that unofficial firmware is presented. Anyway, you can upload your own firmware which will dump bootloader so you can verify there's no malicious code inside.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:02:09
Hardware wallets (in general) have the smallest attack surface from existing solutions. Maybe it isn't perfect, but definitely the best you can do today as normal user.
Even doing everything yourself isn't a solution until you really know what you're doing. There're reports of many people losing all their funds because of manual manipulation with entropy, private keys or signatures (mind of reusing the same R value - 
AFAIK there're no report of any coins stolen or lost from (any) hardware wallet due to bug/backdoor. So statistically this is definitely the best way how to store significant amounts of bitcoins today.
However, using multisig scheme with multiple devices is definitely the way to go for extra large sums.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:28:50

TREZOR ready for UASF means we run backend on UASF and non-UASF nodes, so people can choose what they want.
That's the same way as we were preparing for BU fork.
The only difference is that I, personally, disagreed with BU. And I'm mildly in favor for UASF, although I understand the risk is huge.
However, stand of TREZOR is still the same; we want to provide full support for our users, no matter which chain will win.
@_date: 2017-04-23 22:11:09
It is not fake TREZOR. It is just chinese clone we're aware of (I even know that guy who creates it personally).
Also, it is pretty unclear if that device really had malicious firmware on it - the article does not go into much detail. Maybe you have more detailed information.
Also, there's no need for being sarcastic. It's not possible to be aware of everything. There's so many things happening every day.
@_date: 2017-04-22 20:07:44
Also, we (TREZOR) are doing our best to be as open as possible. The hardware is open so tinkerers may DIY ( The software is periodically audited not only by us and best white-hat hackers around us, but also by our fair competitors (looking at you, Development processes around hardware wallets are simply much more strict and watched by the community than in any other solution.

There's nothing wrong with wallet app for free, for "real average" users. I use Mycelium myself, too. I don't understand why you have problem with paid, extra secure device for yours "1%".
We're still talking about hundreds of thousands people who have enough money in crypto currencies which enjoy it. For those, such advanced security was not easily available before hardware wallets came into the game. For normal users, TREZOR *is* like swiss account in their pocket.

Those necessary changes are actually much smaller than it may look at first sight; most of the crypto was already in TREZOR, now it can just act as FIDO token.

It works exactly like for Bitcoin wallet - if you have your recovery seed, you can recover it to another TREZOR and you have your U2F keys back. That's actually much better than "throw away" U2F tokens, which cannot be backed up and restored.

TREZOR is distributed without firmware. Firmware is uploaded on first use, and it must be signed and the signature is validated by bootloader. Firmware also calculates hash of the bootloader (and report it over USB for independent check).
All this is implemented already.

@_date: 2015-04-08 01:38:19
Well, the list of advantages would be longer, but for example: What other solution *enforces* to use separate identity for every site? To my knowledge, BitId says "hey, give me some bitcoin address, and sign this challenge with it", but it does not care about separation between identities, and separation between identities and addresses used for financial transactions. That's why Stick told you Connect is superset of BitId/BitAuth/BitWhatever and we may or may not add support for those methods now, everything build up to our own TREZOR Connect mechanism.
Also, TREZOR Connect is not more proprietary than BitId. The way that we first made tight integration to TREZOR does not mean we cannot add Android app later as well. *Of course* we want to demonstrate what can be done with TREZOR, but that's pretty obvious, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:11:07
You don't need to connect TREZOR every time you need just to check balance. Actually you usually need to connect TREZOR when you're going to sign transaction, where you would need to enter PIN anyway. So practical difference is small, yet the security and privacy is improved.
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:13:24
Do you know most people don't know how to properly validate Bitcoin Core downloads?
The problem is not the software itself. The problem is distribution channel. I believe many people would download and run any software labeled as "Trezor wallet".
Anyway, to my knowledge, nobody lost anything due to this cause yet. And because we shut down the reporting machine, seems like this particular attack is over.

Yes, its true that i said the majority of users does not care about privacy, at least it apply to mytrezor users, but i think it is more general. Thats why the majority is fine with mytrezor. More privacy-aware users use solution like multibit hd or electrum. We simply refused to put obstacles to mytrezor (like using lists of addresses instead of xpubs, which have performance/UX improvements) just to pretend that we solved unsolvable privacy issues with web apps.
Please does not twist my comme t that *users* do not care about privacy into any conclusion that *we* do not care about privacy. As i said, TREZOR is designed in the best way to not leak any information.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:10:28

I said for *mytrezor* (basic web wallet for trezor targeted to common users) the privacy is not the priority, because its a website anyway (security model of websites is discussable, because you as a user load content from external servers, so you can be tracked easily). 
I never said that privacy is not a priority for TREZOR, because the opposite is true. We even designed the device that it cannot be traced from factory (because initial setup or factory resets wipe *all* data including usb serial number), in opposite to any other competition.
TREZOR runs with many other wallets like Multibit HD, which is desktop app thus it preserve your privacy and leaks minimum information about you to the world (read about SPV mode for more info about multibit privacy nodel)
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:54:29
Correct, since 1.3.3, trezor does not leak any info to computer without the pin.

For long term storage, use TREZOR to create a recovery seed and hide that piece of information. You can then wipe TREZOR and use it as a signing device for smaller amounts if you want. The point is that you have the backup in a recovery seed which never touched an online world.
@_date: 2015-04-13 16:04:39

@_date: 2016-10-15 12:50:12
Not necessary. Depends on type of changes. For blocksize hardfork, there's no need for firmware change at all. This would be necessary only if the format of transaction changes.

Most of the questions have been answered here already. That "DEFCON attack" was, if I remember well, fixed even before it went public. We do not use secure enclave because we do not need that. The solution using seed+pin+passphrase cover also vectors usually "solved" by using secure enclave. Plus, as a bonus, we can have everything opensource. Although secure enclaves are good marketing claims for hardware wallets, we do not plan to use them for good reasons.

Thanks for feedback! You're actually looking for military-grade electronics, not for something what common user need or want :). As you see, there're only few manufacturers of such hardware.
TREZOR v1 is actually really durable - we made "destruction derby" with first prototypes and it was almost impossible to destroy them. So if you want something really durable, v1 is THAT what you want.
Version 2 itself will be surely less durable, because of bigger touch screen. There're always pros and cons of product design. But we're thinking about some protecting case especially for user demands like yours.

GBT (with tx selection), as is, is overcomplicated protocol which cannot be implemented pool-wide on big pools. Bill for transferred data would go over the roof.
TX selection done by any pool is pretty transparent - everybody can check what transactions has been included in every block. If people don't agree with pool's rules, they can vote with feet pretty easily.

Yes, everything is opensource, deterministic and you can even recalculate generated seed on offline computer. TREZOR can print used random numbers on its display during initialization, so you can use them for verifying computer's internal random number has been used, too. Please check python-trezor and its  "trezorctl" commandline tool for such advanced functionality.

\&gt; You trust Trezor to validate the blockchain for you and that Trezor is not spying on you. 
You're wrong! Trezor (the device) is completely trustless as you can connect it to many wallets including Electrum and Mycelium or you can even use our backends, which are completely opensource.
We provide Trezor Wallet (the frontend) for convenience of average users, but it doesn't mean you have to use it to use Trezor.

I see your position, because in this specific case you think Classic is bad. Let's imagine the opposite situation, that you actually see something good what can happen, but it is blocked by zombie miners who don't even care to tell that they don't want this "good" change.
That's why I think it is better to simply ignore votes those who don't vote, like in any other voting system. Let make the decision by the community who is active.
That said, I would do the same even in the parallel universe, where the "main" implementation is Classic and Core supporters want to overtake the network. That's because I don't want to decide for others what's "good" and what's "bad". I don't want to "rule" ;-).
Maybe you missed that, but "Don't care" mines Core. If I really want to support HF, I would redirect this hashrate to Classic. So I actually think we have just a tiny misunderstood about the philosophy - you want to push Core no matter what. I want to stay with Core too, but I don't want to suppress the opposition.
@_date: 2016-10-24 20:28:55
Well, attestation proves that the wallet has original chip, so it is useful for vendor to detect that you connected legitimate device to any service or cloud wallet; it is hard/impossible to make clones which will be able to connect to such services. However it does not prove that the wallet was not tampered somehow. 
Let me give you example: There may be a bypass proxy in between original chip and the computer. The proxy pass attestation messages to original chip, but then in bypass any further communication and will act as malicious device. Or there can be even tampered chip in between display and original chip, so you cannot trust what the display shows you.
I don't think this is very likely. However, if some people are paranoid enough to do not trust border officers about modifying the device, attestation keys does not save them.

Well, mytrezor was always targeted to beginners, rather than for users requiring full stack solution. For those who care more about privacy, there was always Electrum (both client and server opensource) or Multibit (SPV client).
By time mytrezor evolved, too, especially thanks to bitcore backend which is newly supported by beta, but standalone installation will probably require some linux skills, so it's definitely not targeted to average Joe.

a) You cannot downgrade firmware without dropping the private keys on TREZOR.
b) Glithing can be tried only when you already know PIN. If you know PIN, you don't need to do glitching, you can just do normal transaction. Anyway, current implementation has nearly-constant-time of signing, and it is constantly improved.
c) TREZOR design rely on the fact that *every* hardware can be hacked, in the end it is just a matter of money and time. TREZOR is protected also by passphrase, which is recommended for higher amounts, so even extracting private data from the device does not mean your bitcoins are stolen.
Actually I'm quite tired to write these FUD busters again and again here on reddit below posts from Ledger team.
@_date: 2016-05-20 13:36:23
TREZOR itself does not enforce any specific fees, it only warn if the fee is unexpectedly high. myTREZOR as a service is aimed to common users, who usually do not understand how tx fees works and what are the implications of low fees. For setting custom fees you can use "expert" wallets like Electrum or Multibit HD, which both have TREZOR support.

Nowadays, you send each transaction twice. First is the broadcast to node's memorypool. Second is block broadcast once block is found. That second one is problematic, because you want to do broadcast as fast as possible, but with bigger blocks this is getting slower.
But IBLT proposal explains that transactions can be distributed over p2p network only once (in best case), and when block is found, miners exchange just block header with merkle branch (defining which tx is part of the block).

I think you're projecting some fears into my personality, but I'm not that one to blame; The fact you want censor information or possibility of others to express their opinion (=not let them mine Classic) is not how things may work.
I even don't propagate or agree with Classic (as is currently implemented). But: **"I do not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."** And that's exactly what the pool currently does.

@_date: 2016-05-11 12:33:32
Actually made a good point, which can simplify the algoritm a lot:
1) Publish end date as a block height.
2) Publish just one address. Anyone can send any amout there.
3) At the end of the lottery, convert block hash into number.
4) Sort all addresses who sent any transaction to lottery address and give it weight by amount sent to the lottery.
5) Do "block hash modulo total sum" and map the result to winning address.
6) Winner should send you contact details signed by the address which participated in voting.
7) Anybody can audit winning address just this by knowing ending block height and lottery address.
However the problem with message signing persists.

@_date: 2016-05-11 12:09:38
1) Set ending date as a block height.
2) Generate BIP32 seed and give addresses derived from it to users (use addresses from one sequence, e.g. m/0, m/1, ... m/n)
3) After the end of the lottery, count votes from all given addresses. Only transactions confirmed in or before the given block counts.
4) Take block hash, convert it to integer and do "block hash modulo votes". The result is vote which won.
5) Announce the winner address (you can announce it on the website or send back transaction with OP_RETURN and some message; but this can do anyone, so you probably have to announce source address which send such message at first).
6) If you allow more votes per address (which you want to), you have to map the vote back to the winning address (=index of BIP32 used to generate such address).
7) Winner should send you contact details signed by the address which participated in voting. I think this is the biggest obstacle, because many users cannot sign messages when sending coins from some web wallets or even exchanges.
8) Publish xpub of your BIP32 seed, so by knowing this xpub and block hash, everybody can check the winner yourself.
9) Profit

PIN is used for user authentication against TREZOR. So once you've logged into (and entered PIN to TREZOR), he already knows that you're the owner and does not ask for PIN second time (although it ask for transaction confirmation).

I think Trezor is secure by its design and there's not too much space for improvements. Not talking about that "secure element" thingy, which solves what's not a problem and is full of proprietary stuff.
We address general usability and we also want to open development for more developers and projects with the framework we're working on. TREZOR 2 will be really cool and will bring improvements in many areas.


Multisig is already supported by the TREZOR. The problem is that even after huge multisig hype in 2015, there's not a good infrastructure for end users yet. The only player is Copay, which supports Trezor already, but I still think there's lot of stuff to improve in this area. Universal, easy to use multisig infrastructure implementing various use cases with multiple devices etc is currently out of scope for SatoshiLabs and TREZOR.

The context is important. Security model of Yubikey is built on different assumptions than TREZOR. For example, I don't remember single evidence of physical threat in Bitcoin world (especially where secure element would solve the problem, so $5 wrench attack won't count), yet there're terrible stories about software attacks like hacking and phishing. So yes, I still think secure element thingy solves what's not a *real* problem (maybe yet).

You need special laboratory equipment, lot of skills and lot of time. In the end it will cost you thousands of dollars and attack will need most likely weeks of time.
TREZOR design do not rely on 100% unhackable hardware (there actually isn't any, please remind Sony Playstation hack where hackers extracted private keys from "secured microchip"). TREZOR rely on the fact that the attack to specific device is costly and original owner have enough time to move funds to new wallet in meantime.
Plus if you use TREZOR's passphrase protection (which is recommended for higher amounts), extracting private data from TREZOR is worthless, because attacker still don't know the passphrase.
So - for me - attack to TREZOR by extracting private keys is not real world issue. Real world attack is $5 wrench attack:  You don't need any special equipment, no money and no time, and it is aplicable to Ledger as well :-).

Well, bitcoin is built on top of mining, where miners enforce some kind of rules. This is fact, that's how Satoshi designed the network. No matter if those miners are on P2Pool or some pool, they have to care about the health of the network and make decisions (like upgrading to new script types, etc).
I'm not a ruler; I provide a service and people *voluntarily* join the service, because they see it beneficial. My motivation is to provide the best service as possible, including NOT to force miners to any specific implementation, but offer them the same freedom as they run P2Pool with Core/Classic/Unlimited/XT themselves.
I have no special power to any miners. Everything is our free choice. If they care, they can make a decision on my pool as same as they can switch to solo/P2Pool. If they do NOT care, and this percentage of "not care" miners is significant, then the bitcoin have problem.
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:16:12
For statistical purposes, "not voted" and "not care" are two completely different options.
By not voting, even after many approaches and HUGE button on the pool dashboard, user says he is mostly ignorant about what the pool actually does, so his power is "democratically" distributed between those who actually care and who expressed their opinion.
By choosing "not care", the user already expressed himself - he want us to manage rules of his miner. So we choose for this miner what we actually think is the best solution at the moment (and this may change).

How exactly am I abusing my power? It's a matter of single click to stay mining Core on my pool, and there was a lot of communication about that. Quite strange that originally I was "abusing my power" to let unvoted hashrate mine Core only, now I'm abusing power for not doing so :-).
I actually does not support Classic myself. But I want to give people a choice.

You can do this only with expensive laboratory equipment and it will cost lot of time anyway. Best practice, if your device is lost or stolen, is to send money to another seed / another wallet.
Anyway, *any* hardware can be disassembled and flash memory read, that's nothing TREZOR-specific. Keep in mind PlayStation 3 where hackers extracted master private key from the chip. Thankfully TREZOR is designed in the way such attacks are irrelevant. (In this case, passphrase makes you safe in case of theft and hardware disassembly).

.onion is not a problem itself; problem is interfacing with the hardware from website loaded over Tor.

It can be actually done by very simple (python) script with use of some blockexplorer API (e.g. blockchain.info). No hacker skills required.
For example, step "convert block hash into number" is as easy as 
`&gt;&gt;&gt; int('0000000000000000058715d099fb726e009154eafd78bd3aef4bb37f834ec11b', 16)`
(it is hash of block 411305 and the result is ``135538236299552944886251385561986488117820948178787025179`).
Considering there's 1000 votes, the winner for such block is
`135538236299552944886251385561986488117820948178787025179 % 1000`, vote 179.

Sidechannel attack is impractical on TREZOR. You still need to know PIN and/or passphrase to unlock TREZOR to perform at least some signing on the device. Sidechannel is practical on devices which may be asked for doing signatures by unauthorized party.

Bluetooth gives no security advantage over current design, it even doesn't improve user experience, but complicates design (BT module, battery, compatibility, pairing, ...). Actually TREZOR aims to be more a vault than a mobile payment solution. Something what "just works" and what is reliable.

"Paper wallets can be lost, destroyed or stolen" -&gt; Consider to use Shamir shared secret, the algorithm to split the seed or private keys between chunks. Then you need to have N of M shares to reconstruct original information. You can print five papers with 3-of-5 settings, so you'll need any 3 pieces to get your coins back.
* No need to memorize anything

Actually this would be possible by entering the path over the keyboard. Trezor will show the same path on the display and it will ask you if you're fine with revealing MPK for this branch. Then the host can operate only on the branch you accepted and have no information about balances or transaction history of other branches of your master seed. However its quite extended feature which we may address in some of future firmware release.

This is just an offer for people who wanted to order Trezor, but they feel that current pricing of 1BTC/Trezor is too much for them. With the 2for1 action, the dollar price is the same as when we started preorders, so there's actually no reason to apply this discount retroactive.
Not to mention that we aren't sitting on earned bitcoins, but we already spent these bitcoins to pay for manufacturing, so we actually didn't earn much on recent price swings.

PIN doesn't protect you against transaction replacement attack; you cannot be sure if the device is *really* signing the transaction which you asked for, so you still need trusted machine.
You can use Trezor on untrusted machine, for example in internet cafe, because you always have a visual feedback what's going on.

Escrowed pre-order would be useless to us; we asked for pre-orders not because of a good feeling, but because we needed to raise money for hardware manufacturing.


This is general problem of deflationary currency, because it motivate customers to sit down on their coins and speculate on future price and wishing that others will pay for the early development. However this is not anything related to Trezor. Hoarding is serious blocker in using bitcoin in real economy.

Actually this is the only reasonable solution for preorders (=delayed delivery).
Consider that the majority of bitcoin holders believe in rising price of bitcoin. Now who would preorder if we set the price in USD? Probably nobody, because they would just wait to delivery date, to minimize currency risk and spend less bitcoins for the same product as the time go.
But the project doesn't work like this; funding has been necessary since the beginning. Crowdfunding (and this *is* crowdfunding) is completely different story than selling product for flat price.
Think about it.
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:20:13
Trezor is being made for securing bitcoins, paid by bitcoins. Not dollars. Denominate the price only in bitcoins has much sense.
Keep in mind, that with rising usd/btc Trezor is also protecting more value. If I pay 1 BTC for protecting 100 BTC, I still spend only 1% of my funds to protect them against malware/hardware damage/seizure, no matter if one bitcoin is worth $30 or $10.000.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:34:29

BIP32 (algorithm used for organizing private keys) solves that problem by supporting more "accounts" (technically bip32 branches) which may have separated balances and transaction history each to other. This means, you can have an longterm saving account, change money account, account for paying off your mortgage, ...
Technically it is still the same wallet (one paper backup), but offers the same functionality as multiple wallets in current Multibit.
There's yet another solution for advanced users which you may be interested in. Paper backup produced by Trezor may be password protected, but any password will produce a valid bip32 wallet. This enables advanced usage like plausible deniability ( because you can have unlimited number of independent wallets generated from one paper backup, so nobody can obtain how much bitcoins you really posses, even by using Rubberhose cryptoanalysis ( :-).

*At some point* Trezor *may* cost more than a car. Or *maybe* not. Let's focus to present, not to *potential* price in the future. Some people spent a year of their life on Trezor already.  Not some potential year sometimes in future, but they really quit their job just to help us to make this happen. And I really appreciate that community see the effort and that they're supporting us.
I'm not going to say sorry to people who think that current price is too high for them. This is pure form of free market. Buy or don't buy.
