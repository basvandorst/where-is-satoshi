No we haven't.  I keep my own private keys as do many others.  When I put any amount of money on exchange its only about 1-2% of my bitcoins at most, and I consider it gone until I have them back in my posession.  I realize when I send bitcoins somewhere, I no longer own bitcoins, I only own a promise to pay bitcoins.
Those who beg for consumer protections and insurance are the people who are too stupid to take care of themself.  They deserve to get hurt for being idiots.  You think FDIC insures your money in a bank run? They will just print it out of thin air to devalue all dollars in existence.  They will just quadruple the money supply and give it to too-big-to-fail banks in banker bailouts.  They will just have bail-ins and steal your deposits like in Cyprus.  Nice consumer protection there.  Government can't and won't protect you.  Start learning how to protect yourself.

You can't educate these types of people.  Just move on to someone who isn't a jellyfish.

There was a toyota dealership in Massachusetts that said they were accepting Bitcoin, but on inquiry it turns out they don't because of lack of market demand, but you may want to call and give it a shot.  Here they are listed on airbitz business directory:

This seems awesome.  But what if a seller is in California, and the buyer is in New York? They still deliver it, or is it only local?

Yeah I see your point, but there are still some who just can't be saved.  The words "horribly illegal" stood out to me, and made me think its highly likely this is one of the ones who have no hope.
