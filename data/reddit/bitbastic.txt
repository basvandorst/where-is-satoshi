Ive had 11 cash-outs so far average processing time about 45 minutes. Evidently, some guys duplicated vouchers and got caught, and are now posting everywhere they can that the whole casino is a scam. I love the low vig and hot girl, lol.
I hope this helps

Attn Moderator:
Other forum moderators have already removed threads created by this user, who is engaging in malicious activities, in an attempt to extort and defraud.threatening peoples lives?  Come on. Please treat this responsibly, and remove. This is inappropriate, and the poster is the owner or employee of another competing website. Although I cannot prove this I have been told by over a dozen forum members and a moderator, that this is the case, furthermore the day this was posted coinbet received a demand from someone via a hushmail email who was not even a registered user on our site. This individual attempted to extort them via threats of a DDOS attack.

Been betting sports for a month now on the site, I read an article on CNBC about them. ESPN also had coverage. Bottom line these guys are licensed, big, and with this type of media coverage looks like they have serious $. I made 24 bets 11 deposits and 8 withdraws. Average processing time is about 20 minutes. Site is AWESOME!

We really need a moderator to reign in the ridiculous posts in forums, and perhaps the creation of threads that are sensationalist and fraudulent in nature. 
I investigated this thoroughly, because when this garbage first started swirling around the internet, I had just opened an account with this book  and naturally was nervous. So I made no future deposits, got my $600.00 bucks up to $1,800.00 requested a cash-out and got it in EXACTLY 37 minutes! OMG!
So, then I called customer service and had a nice chat with them, I found out that there are a few people who attepted to defraud the casino, got caught and now have dedicated their lives to posting negative comments  all over the web. Goes to show you, that without some filter, there will always propaganda filled messages and misinformation that will be spread by the few to influence the many. Oh well, guess I just have to deal with it, until Reddit decides there is too much garbage being posted here by criminals posing as victims.
Footnote: I have had 11 subsequent withdrawals from the site and now feel bad for the book that has been so good to me because the bitcoin community does not allow for moderation in its forums, maybe we can strive to fix this.
The whole forum idea is great, but here is the most obvious proof of a great idea, gone bad.
