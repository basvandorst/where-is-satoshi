I'm hoping this ms news brings in more development and awareness in btc. Since I'm no coder I'm hoping someone who codes and was unaware of bitcoin until the news broke out comes in and sees what they can do here. Also buy more bitcoins too!

Thanks, so I'll just check out mycelium,just downloaded it. I also should look into, Faucets since I'm new to bitcoin and want to collect

Its a beautiful time to be young, its time to shape the future now
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:35:41
Also, thank you so much for the tip... I literally have enough bitcoin to buy a cookie right now:)

Very interesting take 50 bits for this news. Good read and I feel like it will happen. I hopped in after flirting with bitcoin for over a year for this purpose. Its the best time to get in on this.

He's such a genius.
@_date: 2014-12-13 03:50:54
I see what your saying. In my opinion this is why more development is needed in this. Make this operation run smoother with new code
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:55:03
Good news but I hope it will create more awareness for better development of bitcoin.

This means a lot, who knows if there's a brilliant xboxer who just learned about  bitcoin and could potentially develop code that could make the technology stronger. 
Just because of one meaningful payment addition.

It does take a bank an entire day to do this FYI.
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:47:22
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-12-10 16:52:28
Thanks for the clarification, I keep hearing about how great the blockchain technology can be.

Apple is like that old man who constantly tries to act cool, never get it until years later. 
Hopefully apple follows and starts setting the tone for the future.

I don't know about skyrocketing say tomorrow but in 5 years I think it will be completely main stream and safe. This needs time and proper development in software. I can't do it but I hope someone or some group can.

What, that they bought a buttload? Or is there something different?
@_date: 2014-12-10 14:44:40
Things are changing, I think we are all at the forefront of this change and if your paying attention to it, you might set up your life for the future. I really think bitcoin( or a variation of it) is the future of currency.

If you haven't heard of Andreas Antonopoulos look into him and buy his book. Its nothing I understand but you might

My goal by the end of next year is to have 1.... I'm trying to do it by earning it, 2nd job kind of thing but I haven't figured that part out yet.
Edit: how can I forget to congratulate you!! Congrats!

Just reading all the comments here, there's some really good conversation going on in this thread. Very interesting to read.

500 bits will get you 1 bit of shit. McDonald's is a ponzi!!!
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:46:31
I'm dipping in myself. I think this could be a good investment in a few years. I say in about 5-10 years we will see what this is made of
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:26:47
Wow, I'll have to check it out.....I had not idea
 10 bits @_date: 2014-12-10 15:24:28
Hopefully this all gets resolved. Quick newbie question. The blockchain technology is associated with blockchain or are they separate entity's?
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:03:34
2 questions :Can someone explain a fosset to me?
I have bits in 2 wallets, blockchain and to coinbase...which should be my primary
Edited to make more clearer that I had 2 questions
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:55:23
This is an excellent FAQ to someone new to bitcoin . thank you
@_date: 2014-12-12 21:28:04
Wish I got this much luck when I said I started bitcoin here. Oh well, timing is everything 50 bits @_date: 2015-01-06 18:23:01
This is awesome, thank you for this list .
@_date: 2014-12-09 20:34:29
Well I do have an idea.... What about adding a "DOS and donts of bitcoin" since it is fairly new and there's the risk of scams, hacks etc I think that could be a good idea.
