I agree. 70bil doesn't just move out of the market in a few hours... Westerners were sleeping too... 
These types of coordinated retractions occur every few days. Like you said, big money making money... High stakes gambling.

This makes 0 sense. I get the two are paired, but BTC dropping in value simply means you can buy more of it with your alts. Alt coins values should not drop at the same time as BTC. This is manipulation. I have a feeling the exchanges play with the btc--&gt;alt--&gt;USD conversions to induce volatility on days when exchange volume is down.
Cmc shows a 10% dip in market value in a matter of hours... Westerners weren't even awake... So, all of the east just decided to dump all their coins at the same time?

Stop pretending you're a day trader. Blockchain coins are commodities right now exchanged on feelings, not logic. You can't predict the next Reddit "fud" by measuring market pressure, projections, and analyzing trades with algorithms...
Bitcoin rallied because Reddit conspiracy theories that banks were buying all the Bitcoin. You got played. Everyone sold off their alt-coins for BTC. Now, you're seeing that money flow back into alt-coins as everyone is realizing they got played.
Bitcoin has seen the beginning of the end. It's not a useful coin. It's value is only being propped up by exchnages using it as a store of value for trades. Get a clue.
Bitcoin down to 15k by tomorrow.

Yes, I know that. The point was that THEY SHOULDN'T be investing on emotion. Bitcoin is a useless coin. People should react in fear by selling off alt-coins when money moves out of bitcoin.

What? Yes, I am talking about an "intra-day" movement as well. And, I was dead on. Bitcoin down to 15k. Please let this be a wake-up call.
