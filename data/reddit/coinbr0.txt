@_date: 2017-10-19 15:51:17
Why downhill tho? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:23:51
There are a couple of reasons for this. 
People buy the buzz, wallstreet is getting more and more involved, the financial crisis plays a roll and of course the fork!
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:49:05
I get the joke, would be an insane mindfuck if bitcoin were a company. Then Jamie wouldve been right about it being a fraud...
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:41:44
Great expaination. Check this out to see what that means in terms of price --&gt; 
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:35:13
Awesome, what is your favorite coin?
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:49:57
Where are you storing your coins? Do you own the private keys? Because those can get stolen for sure!
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:22:24
Because this world is fucking corrupt! There is no question there. People are acting like its fine, but it is really fucked up if you think about it. 
We all should smoke some weed and get to a healthy level of paranoia 
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:59:42
He didn't get fired or just not for this reason?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:22:27
I can feel that crypto insomnia building up LOL
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:27:22

@_date: 2017-10-12 11:13:41
Bitcoin be like : "Now lets talk about my salary"  hahahah
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:26:24
Would be insane, im bullish on BTC. Congrats on the 8% already today guys!
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:27:20
That escalated quickly
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:43:04
Makes sense but the title says differently
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:07:28
27k plus sounds way optimistic for 4 months. Lets see if we can get some support on 10k first totally!
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:26:14
Does this mean that we can expect more Bullish trends, since Putin is a Bear Hunter?!
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:57:13
Im totally with you on that!
