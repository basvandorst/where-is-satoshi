Thank you everyone for the great advice. I have found the other bitcoins in a program called bitcoin core ? Is that a safe program ? I have 15 bitcoins in total and I am thinking about giving my uncle half of them

Thank you. Should I keep them on the hard drive ? Or is there a safer way ?

My goals are just to have enough that when I have a family I can support them and enjoy life. This is a life changing amount of money to me and I think I have many big decisions to make. First I need to take everyone's advice and keep them safe

Ok thanks guys ! You have given me great advice. I will do this and hopefully sit on the coins. As I work full time I can provide for myself and activities I want to do but When would you guys consider selling ? I'm sorry for all the questions in this thread I just don't know much about it at all
