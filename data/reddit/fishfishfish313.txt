The accumulation phase is at least halfway over....
Follow the money. Volume will lead price.

Coinbase is a private entity and the business and can operate however it wants to. Also, as a consumer you have the choice not to give them business or to participate in adding to their revenue stream.
It is also your right to boycott them. So from a capitalist standpoint, nothing has changed.

Agreed. As a private entity they can do whatever they want. If you do not like what they are doing do not use their service.

Looks pretty good man. You will have a hard time competing with the other more well known portfolio trackers, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
Good luck on the project.
