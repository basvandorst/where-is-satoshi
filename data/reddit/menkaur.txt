Core refusing to consider block size increase because it might impact number of people running full nodes doesn't qualify?

I'm not saying that we all should adopt BU. I think that Lightning is an awesome idea and I'd like to see it implemented.
What I'd like to see happen instead is core presenting a counter-proposal for blocksize increase in .15. For example, they could allow blocks of any size, but make miners pay for increasing blocksize over an average. For example, you want to create 2MB blocks when average blocksize is 1MB? No problem, that'll be 12.5 BTC out of your block reward
The miners, of course, are going to pass this cost to the users. So users can "vote" with their fees wheather a large blocksize is needed
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:23:16
I see. You could be storing a list of addresses and the balances on the hard drive, but sorting them for a quick search is going to pose a challenge of it's own
Btw. By any chance, did you ever experiment with what happens to performance if you write entire b-tree to file on an SSD? How long does it take to validate 1MB block? This sounds like something that could scale lineary
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:05:16
True. Can you think of a good way to expand block size and avoid misuse?
p.s. I know that a miner can also be a user (e.g. originate transactions), but miner's role is solely aggregating transactions. Bitcoin is built in a way that  anyone really can be a user, provided that he owns bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:13:36
Miners would not dictate block size. Users would. If users choose to transact on blockchain, that will lead to larger blocksizes. If users choose to transact off-blockchain, than blocksize won't increase. Miners will just represent the users in that respect
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:05:25


I agree. But this is a technical problem, and it should be solved in a technical way. Limiting growth to solve this problem kinda defeats the purpose

You could have memory mapped file with size of 1000GB, and it can efficiently be used on a machine with 1GB RAM. The OS takes care of it
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:00:13
Reading goatpig_armory's post about that 
Actually, the best criticism of blocksize increase I've read so far
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:33:04
I've run a full node for years. And yea, I'm currently running .14.
And a hard-coded block size limit is an artificial limitation on a possible consensus that can emerge. Miners don't really care about block size. They care about their profits. And their profits will decline significantly if btc users will go somewhere else. And that will happen if BTC no longer serves the needs of it's users. Imposing artificial limitations on the way BTC users may and may not transact with each other makes this probable. Miners should not be free to increase block size. BTC users should. And they should vote whether they want to increase the blocksize or not by transacting on-chain or off-chain. If developers take away this choice, than they no longer represent the best interests of BTC users
@_date: 2017-03-20 06:50:40
I think that the RAM problem is fixable and only loosely  connected to the problem of block size limit. For example, you could put relevant data into memory mapped file or something
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:41:37
No, to users, not nodes. I consider anyone who generates BTC transaction a user. And people who generate transactions ultimately should determine what the bitcoin infrastructure should look like
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:00:40
you don't give MINERS full control over block size. You give full control over blocksize to BTC users. If users want to transact off-blockchain, they should be able to do so. If users want to transact on the blockchain, there should be nothing stopping them from doing this too. Imposing artificial ideological limitations on what BTC users can and cannot do IS REALLY REALLY BAD FOR THE NETWORK. Miners don't create transactions. They just put those transactions into blocks. Miners cannot create large blocks if BTC users don't choose  to generate data for them
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:32:31
I suppose that depends on your perspective. Currently for you to transact with someone, you have to make an entry in the blockchain. Lightning is going to modify that statement. I think that lightning will make btc a completely different currency.
If you are refering to how BU could be enacted (via 75%) I must agree, that could be worrying. However, miners cannot do anything to prevent anyone from leaving btc. So they might be having a supermajority, but the moment they start using it for something WE don't like, they are going to destroy the very fiundation on which their business is built
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:55:33
Maybe it is. But a lot of people, including me, still run full nodes.
You use up hard drive space and in exchange you get access to full btc transaction history and enhanced privacy and security.
And honestly I don't see 6 Bln people using BTC and blockchain having small size at the same time. And Segwit+Lightning or not, I don't see how we can get there without making the blocks bigger
One way to go about it to switch to partial nodes where you would have to keep only last n blocks on your hard drive, where N is a function of the space you are willing to dedicate to the task.
I guess this is the same process as division of labor. As society becomes more advanced, people start to specialize. The same is happening to bitcoin, where only "specialists" store and verify the blockchain, and the rest can go without.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:37:47
Ok. Here are a few simple facts
1. Segwit and later lightning change the way bitcoin works. 
2. Currently, BTC is over capacity
3.  If Lightning works as advertised there is no problem with blocksize increase, people are going to use it because it IS superior, so block size will become non-issue
4. To find out if it's actually is superior, we need people to choose it over normal transactions on blockchain. People using Lightning because they can't afford on chain transaction fee is NOT a good model to improve BTC
5. If segwit is adopted today and lightning tomorrow, exchanges will be the main lightning nodes (let's talk centralization!)
6. Exchanges usually implement KYC and AML
7. In this case, most transactions over BTC will become KYC and AML compliant
8. Miners have not been an enemy in the past, and taking short term profits by intentionally splitting blockchain is not a good idea.  Anyway, we have several altcoins implementing blocksize increase protocols without extreme centralization, and I don't see why bitcoin should be any different
9. When bitcoin grows, specialization (read, centralization) is inevitable. Division of labor is a sign of a developed society, and if ever miners will become a problem, we'll work on fixing that problem
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:20:11


Love the idea. We just make cost/difficulty increase exponential. Something like Exp[Abs[new_size/average_size-1]].
That way, if a miner wants to mine a block that is 1% larger than average, he'll just be solving a problem that is 1% more difficult than average. If he wants to increase block size by 2 times, that's 2.7 times more difficult, and 1000 times is some crazy number with 425 zeros
Or even better. We can do the same with costs. Like, to create a block that is 2x as large as average, you'll have to transfer 1.7 btc to a null account at the start of the block (from fees?). This way gives BTC users direct control over how large the blocks should be. It's also going to do interesting things to BTC exchange rate, since BTC will be destroyed to create larger blocks. I think this should be made dependent on the block reward though
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:11:15
Yes, this totally sounds like Chinese way of dealing with the bitcoin "problem". 
I think if core developers decide to put a good (or better?) counter-proposal for blocksize increase, majority of the network is guaranteed to go with them. Simply because they seem more competent than BU developers
For example, Monero has a dynamic blocksize. They do it by making the miners pay for increasing the blocksize compared to average blocksize (miners get less block reward if they increase the block size)

Not according to what I read. They say that they will support B2X if B2X adds replay protection.
From what I understand from the tweets, they are planning to support bitcoin and add B2X support when/if they add replay protection
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:31:49
and the problem was solved by preventing actors other than bitmain from obtaining those asics, instead of getting the hashrate distributed amongst different people and making sure that no single entity can control that portion of hashrate again

It's true that anyone can start a new chain, but I'm interested in what happens when the developers want to introduce protocol breaking changes and how that can be best handled.
if nobody uses the old chain any longer, than the price will just go to 0, and that's it. on the other hand, next time there is a real contentious issue, like miners wanting to break 21m limit or one part of miners wanting to get rid of another part of miners or raising maximum block size or whatever, having the old chain being bitcoin by default and being traded against new chains will prove to be to real advantage. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:46:26
Maybe, however, the anti-asic mentality seriously reminds me of protectionism in offline politics, and I find the process of actively modifying protocol to combat threats that did not yet materialize by providing artificial advantage to one group of miners over another group of miners much more worrying than actual threat of 51% attack on monero
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:46:56


What actually settled it was many organizations in the b2x group "discovering" that "upgrading" the protocol does not upgrade bitcoin, it just creates a new coin, and that was the reason why many bailed on the proposal. 


how would that even work? Miners changing details of the protocol would just create another coin. Sure they can do it any time, but what's the profit in that? The rest of the network will just reject their changes. The only serious danger I've heard so far was a single miner taking over within existing rules and assuming the identity of bitcoin, which is nasty, but he still would be bound by existing protocol rules


Absolutely true. And I think that we discovered a good method of hardforking during the final of blocksize debate
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:43:09
The protocol that is compatible with all existing chain clients
@_date: 2018-04-29 09:57:42
I think that using another unit can create some more confusion
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:22:48
we are talking about the decentralized systems, and the developers do not own the protocol
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:42:28
yea, sure. is there any good reason why not? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:31:13
this is interesting. why is monero supposed to hard fork every 6 months?
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:44:21


Here's an example:


And in fact this is exactly what would had happened


I still don't get the part where the author suggests that there is a way to increase total supply over 21m without a hardfork (but I see a way the total supply could be decreased).
Sure, majority miner can stop processing any transactions until people do what he says, but most lilkely people will switch the protocol, which I'm assuming is what you suggest should be done anyway.
But than for some reason, you keep insisting that we call the new version of the protocol by the same name as the old version. Not Bitcoin++ or bitcoin 2 or whatever, but explicitly call it bitcoin and fight over it with the miner that has taken it over.
I think it's easyer to say "Bitcoin is dead, long live Bitcoin++"
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:48:35
yea, totally true. and the best way to decide the winner after the fork is by trading the tokens on the old chain for the tokens on the new chain. do you disagree?
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:08:32
Totally true. And in case bitmain actually dominates bitcoin, as things stand right now, I believe that it'll keep the name of bitcoin should a large part of community fork off. Bitmain will argue exactly like I do right now, and it is likely they'll convince the exchanges. In fact, the argument I'm using was the core argument against b2x. I'm just trying to formalize it
On the other hand, adopting the attitude right now gives some advantages in immutability of the protocol.
For instance. You cannot increase the block size in Bitcoin. Because increasing the blocksize will just create another coin. 
I think that right now the major threat to bitcoin is a lot of newcomers who believe that bitcoin has "governance problems" and who are willing to invest money in blockchains with "voting". And there always will be people trying to play politics, by, for example, "improving" btc by changing the block size or by changing the mining algo or by removing the 21m cap or by doing any other "beneficial" things they fancy.
Formally defining bitcoin as the original protocol will put an end to all of those "improvements"
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:02:16
That poses an interesting problem. I'm aware that there is a lot of experimentation going on with Monero protocol. 
Do you agree that going forward, that would be a good protocol for bitcoin hardforks though?
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:18:16
What is the old bitmain version of bitcoin? 
Language is one thing, technology is another thing, and with technology we can figure out rules of what to properly call things
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:00:02
This is a definition that makes sense. If you have a better definition, go ahead and write it down
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:40:38
yes, exactly. when you bought/mined tokens before the fork, you agreed to the consensus rules of that protocol, and it's only natural that those rules are unchanging. treating it any other way just create confusion, especially amongst newcomers
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:49:53
My impression has been that the fork has been announced in response to Bitmain announcing Monero asics. Also, the reason why there aren't too many Monero asics on the market right now is that on youbube, Riccardo repeatedly threatened to fork if asics will become available. 
I think that the reason why Bitmain started asic mining Monero before the announcement is because those asics needed to be properly tested before they will became available to the general market. 
I'm pretty sure that there is quite some support for banning asics in Monero community, since many people have invested in generalized mining hardware (gpus), and with advent of asics, this hardware would had become much less profitable. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:07:17
First off, blockchain is not a person, and second, if you change inner workings of something, it's natural to give it another name (or at least, upgrade the version). I don't see a reason why monero can't go to Monero1, Monero2, Monero3 etc every 6 months as long as it keeps making changes which are incompatible with the previous version
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:17:13
The way this is handled right now, the vulnerability exists as long as asics can be built. 
This can be opposed to bitcoin's approach where asics aren't a threat because a lot of different people with different perspectives have them, and those people have invested money into bitcoin infrastructure and are really not interested in killing it. On top of that, we know that the best technologies will be widely and openly used to produce the most efficient ways to do the mining, and than widely distributed to everyone who cares to host them.
Also, on a gut level, making changes to the protocol to combat asics is a much more centralized approach than bitcoin's laissez faire. Developer doesn't like the way people use the currency he works on, so he makes changes to actively combat the use cases he dislikes. Do you really think this makes monero less centralized?
