Where did you hear about this? It's not mentioned on Twitter, Reddit, or any other news site. It's not even mentioned in Dell's website. This is a baseless rumor! Lies I tell you. Lies!

Wow, thanks! This is a personal milestone for me: my first tip! Will tip it forward.

It is feasible. Unfortunately, they probably don't know what Bitcoin is... yet.

They made [THIS]( too last January.

I'm no expert, but here's what I think if you're interested. You should check with your organization's lawyer and accountant. Also, since you accept donations via PayPal, read about stories of people whose PayPal accounts are closed due to transacting in Bitcoin. Check if there's any truth to them. Check the services offered by CoinBase and BitPay if they have something that will fit your need.
Videos describing projects will definitely help, but I don't think the QR code is necessary, and could even just add to the confusion. If you want to advertise you accept bitcoin, just show the promotional image "bitcoin accepted here". A simple donate button near the video should suffice. Let the user pick a method of payment, and if they choose Bitcoin, then show the QR code.

You're right. It definitely makes sense to keep the prices in USD and other currencies, but not BTC. I just mentioned the dropdown because I didn't see that Bitcoin payments are accepted. So a better solution is to display the different modes of payment for the users to see when they're browsing the store (logos of PayPal, credit cards, Bitcoin, etc). I'm not an expert on e-commerce though, so I could be wrong. Maybe this is already in your backburner, so I won't bug you about it. As a fan of your site, I agree that keeping up with the normal posts is more important. Keep up the good work.

I want to see spotify accept Bitcoin, but for now, I think it's better to spend time convincing other business who are more likely to accept Bitcoin.

The first meet-up was in Makati in Metro Manila. We haven't set the venue for the next one. One person suggested Baguio.
What did you do in Cavite? :)

I've read about a digital currency that uses the concept of storage fees to discourage people from hoarding coins. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. That's not the only way to get a large stake in the economy though. To be "completely immune" seems impossible. Designing it that way could sacrifice some of the freedom in the currency.

Thanks for the insight.
I wonder if using a service like BitPay helps remove some if not all of the risk. They would only receive dollars and never possess any bitcoins. Still, I've heard people lose access to their PayPal account supposedly due to Bitcoin. If they lose donors' money due to that, as much as it's PayPal's fault, it's also the responsibility of the non-profit to avoid such risk.
Your comment also gives me an interesting idea. A separate group can accept Bitcoin for them. This seems like a bad idea at first. But having one public address to receive the donations can help make it very transparent. The group can then donate the money to the non-profit. This would only work if the non-profit allows publishing the donor's name with the amount donated.

There should be another meet-up soon. Don't be sad. :)

Purpose? I was just talking to someone about the price of Bitcoin in 10 years, and I realized that always comparing to USD is a bit misleading. Saying that 1BTC is worth $10M in 10 years doesn't give a complete picture if we don't know the value of the dollar then. So I suggested maybe it's better to compare it to raw materials such as rice or oil. Then I remembered CPI.
I didn't realize that the basket of goods used in the US is secret. I'll look into it.
I was thinking of a website that displays the Bitcoin CPI in terms of many things, with the US CPI just one of them.
If the CPI is too tedious and not useful anyway, how about a Big Mac Index? I come from a country where the price of rice would be a good metric, but I suppose that doesn't translate well to other countries.
Edit: Ok, the Big Mac Index apparently has a different purpose, and McDonald's don't exactly sell big macs in BTC. Sorry about that.

New crypto currencies with significantly better features will be trying to be relevant, and Bitcoin(1) will block them out of the game. That's an interesting future, and not far-fetched.
(1) Not exactly Bitcoin, but people who have large stakes in Bitcoin, and don't want to see their wealth evaporate. Bitcoin itself is decentralized after all. Also, I'm not referring to the current alt-coins. Just imaginary crypto-currencies in the future that are hypothetically x-times superior by design.
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:47:56
Interesting. I knew they had people funding at least $10k each, but didn't realize there were 6.
Anyway, I agree. It's not a resounding approval. No one made that claim anyway.

Yes! They just finished their honeymoon, and... oh, that was rhetorical :(
@_date: 2013-07-21 02:44:58
After roughly 50 minutes, it finally went through.
I guess as long as the BTC to USD rate doesn't fall more than 10%, it's all good.
I'll never use Coinbase to with Bitpay ever again (until Coinbase announces improvements on the way they broadcast payments).
@_date: 2013-08-04 03:14:09
bitfarms would be cool. I'm just afraid La Nay Ferme is the only one out there right now, so maybe it's too early to work on such a website. Maybe just reserve the domain for now, and publish a placeholder message and collect emails for farmers who accept bitcoins. I think something that simple would already be cool.

I've been checking their Youtube channel and Kickstarter page. I didn't see updates. I only realized they had updates on Facebook because of this post. So thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:17:20
Well, they did get enough funding, so it's not that few.
@_date: 2013-07-26 04:14:38
Isn't it the same for most KS projects though? The idea is to get money from backers, make a product, and possibly make profit. Backers get a reward, which some people can argue is not enough because they are risking money, and should have a stake if the company makes millions. So I don't see it as an issue specific to this project. Just KS in general.

I'm merely considering what erikwithaknotac said, and saying I think it's not far-fetched. I'm not supporting the idea, nor am I predicting it's likely. I don't have faith in the status quo.


Probably. Somehow this reminds of zerocoin. I hope the core developers would not only keep up but lead the innovation, but perhaps that's asking too much.

Now why didn't I see this before using Coinbase with Bitpay.
I read that your coins won't be in limbo.

For example, in one of the first lecture videos, it shows the size of the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve from August 2012 is $2.8 trillion, while before the 2008 crisis (or the pre-Bitcoin era), it's less than $1 trillion, so it has literally tripled.
