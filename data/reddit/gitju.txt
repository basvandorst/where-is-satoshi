The news is a haux. No encryption and crypto is destroyed by this article. This goes back to  in modulo space and is everything but not what is described in this article.

Its the second time now that I have problems with them. 
1. time was: I refered 5 people over 2-3 weeks three of them were close friends.
My ref counter was 5 then and 0 the next day.
Support told me it is a display error.
1 month later this thing was still not fixed also after contacting the support again. Meanwhile I refered 3 other people.
My ref counter shows 3.
Still waiting for my 5 lost refs and now also for my miner.

I guess they now use the mined BTC from all those deleted miners to pump Paycoin...

We are talking here about a case where the company (GAW) is in country 1 and the customer (I) is in country 2 and country 1 is not equal to country 2 and the damage is not worth to take legal actions. If tomorrow, in the next weeks or months someone else discovers that his miner(s) are not accessible anymore and he/she has spend some thousands of dollars he/she may can do this and I did whats need to be done in that case I have warned other people.

I can confirm that. I'm too disappointed by GAW. Today I logged into my ZenCloud and I saw that I got no miner anymore. Its just not there anymore. Away. I contacted the support and asked where my miner is. Hours later I got an email with a response where my questions was not answered. 
Since 1 month I'm missing 5 refs too. I had 5 then it went down to 0 on one day. Support told me 1 month ago this is just a display error and will soon be fixed. Seems to be very fishy to me and reminds me on Mt. Gox.

I contacted them, they told me it was deleted.
I replied 2 days ago since then no answer
This was my miner 
When I login now I got 0 miners, no new BTC are mined.

I mined BTC and no Paycoin by GAW.

I use two factor, my miner wasn't sold or something by someone. Its just not there anymore.
Support anwered me now they have deleted all promotional miners.
Those miners were promoted as lifetime miners on a couple of websites and I also never read something about a time limited offer during the registration.

If this is their answer I would never use them again.

 is a nice tool to check which fees should be used for a transaction to most likely get included within the next 1-2 block(s).
@_date: 2016-11-22 10:40:16
You could contact them so that they change that and it won't happen in the future for you and other users. The statistics of that page also tells you when you circa can expect your payment based on the fees that were used.

Because of all the war crimes that this government did they just declare you to be a problem for the security whether you are a problem or not. We don't have legal systems for fun.

This goes too far. We the 99% must stop this development. A state is made out of people not to rule people by a corrupt "elite".
