Right. But how is it decided? It's inherent in the protocol how, how does the protocol take into consideration the time and adjust appropriately?

So it's not really a difficulty in terms of calculating a problem, but rather difficulty in guessing right? I guess it takes longer to roll the dice the slower your computer is, right? So the fastest nodes out there can re-roll the dice more frequently hence having a greater chance of guessing right. Is that a correct understanding (superficially)?
In that case, "who" decides what range is acceptable?

Oh! Ok, got it! I thought someone earlier in this thread said the timestamps have nothing to do with it. But thanks, I think I get it now on a very superficial level.

Despite taking hours to move Bitcoins, it’s still faster than moving bars of gold. And it’s modern and cool. If you ask the purple who praise Bitcoin. If you ask traditional economists, the answer is “well, we are using gold for that, Bitcoin is just a hype”.

I don’t understand your reasoning.  When you sell, someone buys. The last one in the row of buyers is the loser.

It was the goal but that is no longer possible. If anything, it will be a commodity backing some other currency like crypto. Lightning Network is an example. Of course, my analogies aren’t perfect because... well, crypto coins is a relatively new thing, but if Bitcoin is the banks reserve, the Lighting Networks is their credit swaps and customer account balance. The daily transactions are made through the Lighting Network and are cleared later in bulk.
Here’s a very interesting thing in my opinion. I’m not talking in technological terms but rather economics. Bitcoin that was supposed to be free from all regulations and a parallel currency in a laiz fare economy, is quickly becoming nothing more than a commodity in our already existing financial system. To get your fiat, you need to register with your ID in accordance to law. The IRS wants Bittrex and others to report you. Banks and institutions are issuing various derivatives. It’s to speed up trading, you can buy ETF like products that follow the price. I mean, all this is interesting because it shows that more people are taking Bitcoin seriously. But at the same time, it shows that our economy is so huge and has developed for so long, that we’re all part of it no matter what.

So far it lacks the properties of a currency. It does have several properties of a commodity though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:39:15
That’s the key here. The one that doesn’t swing. Nor increase or deprechiate. The stable one. That will make a good currency. But a terrible investment.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:16:08
Unless the other currency is stable and therefor doesn’t “take off”. That’s a good currency.

“Resets technicals”. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:34:07
It’s not a currency, it’s a commodity.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:29
What makes the others shitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:37:44
Sure. But gold isn’t the most used value holder in commodities because of its properties. It just happens to be the most used one, with the highest liquidity among precious metals, because we’ve agreed it is. Bitcoin has been around the longest and therefor has an unprecedented liquidity among cryptos. And the more financial institutions issue derivatives of bitcoin (e.g futures), the more cemented it becomes as a value holder. It might just end up obsolete, and but a memory of the great crypto times. But it might also end up being a de facto value holder. And when people ask “why bitcoin and not any of the other coins out there” the answer will simply be “because bitcoin is bitcoin” (gold is gold).
If we’re looking at it from a pure technical perspective, there are way better cryptcoins out there. Cardano (ADA) is said to be scalable, and the developers have a proven track record. But then again... as a storage of value, so far history has shown it doesn’t really matter.

For those who believe in its future, the need is a value holder against inflation. Like gold. Think of it as a way to “park” money. Again, if we all agree that it is. The Winkelvoss brothers believe it’s the new gold. Others think it’s a speculative bubble.

Haha, right… So you're telling me that the every living person using Bitcoin should from now on say "I will not take your money unless you can show me the block chain?". And this person should repeat that mantra no matter how many time the other person says "I will pay you X2 the money, if you just look the other way"? I wish you the very best in making that happen.

If I may ask, how do you import the exported MacWallet? My MacWallet suddenly stopped working and I would like to import my backupped wallet but have no idea how to do it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:57:35
What do you mean by that? That Bit Gold was only a theory, and never made it to actual code? Or that Bitcoin had better code?
