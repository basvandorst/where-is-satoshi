They don't have to succeed in killing it. They just have to succeed at making sure it never goes mainstream.
Harsh regulation will keep bitcoin used by geeks and druggies forever.
To counter this, bitcoin adoption by merchants needs to be faster than negative legislation can occur.
It comes down to how many and how big the merchants accepting bitcoin are, not how many of us are using it.

Silver would like to disagree with you.

I mean that if you have massive services that have adopted it as a currency it becomes exceptionally difficult to stop it without generating massive supporting press, unless the government can fully justify itself better than the big boys can justify themselves. This becomes significantly harder when you've got people like Bill Gates praising it, who is incredibly liked these days.
If ebay and amazon get behind bitcoin for example then any negative legislation aimed at killing it entirely has the potential to generate sopa levels of streisand effect.
The more bitcoin is adopted the more likely they are to send it through the roof by attempting to kill it, rather than sending it through the floor. Every single attempt at killing other decentralised technological innovation has had the opposite effect, blowing them up. There is no reason to think the same wouldn't happen with bitcoin.
Either the government legislates in a manner that the big boys would agree with - which would just further legitimise the currency - or the government legislates in a way that the big boys would oppose and cause an immense amount of press about, causing the streisand effect, causing an explosion.
What bitcoin needs to do is cross that line of merchant adoption before the government really draws up a battle plan. My bet is on it crossing that line early enough, the law has consistently been far too slow to react to emerging technologies, there's no reason to think that it would be quick enough to stop BTC, but there IS the risk.
What those of us positive about BTC can do in the meantime is continue to email merchants and push for adoption from them all.

Worrying thought, but I think as much as some would WANT to do that, they wouldn't be able to, mutually assured destruction and all that.
US overt patriotism might finally die down once they're no longer "Merica number 1", that's a thought...

Oh shit, someone actually made real hacking look like TV cracking.

If you trade on news you're going to get burned, trading on news is exceptionally stupid.
The CFTC news can just as easily be called a positive as opposed to a negative. It legitimises BTC.

In a downtrend.
