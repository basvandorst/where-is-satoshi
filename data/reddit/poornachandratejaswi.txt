As I said timing the market is stupid in general but, these were extraordinary circumstances. You don't have to catch the absolute minima or maxima to maximize your profits. Anywhere between 20% of the extremes would have fetched you a lot more coins.

Bitch please. You fucked up. You should have sold a couple of days ago when you heard the news. You could have bought almost twice the coins with the same amount.
I get the whole hold thing but, if you are a smart speculator holding is not the best way to go about it. I know timing the market is stupid but, when events like these unfold if you're holding on to your coins without doing anything you're a bad investor/speculator.
