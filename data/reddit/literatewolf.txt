I like all cryptos equally but Dogecoin is a great experiment to see what happens when it reaches the maximum amount of coins. All other cryptos need to look at the results and determine how, if possible, to avoid or encourage the results, depending on what occurs.

That is the fine print. Apple could say they allow them but approve none of them. Apple needs to wake up and face the future. Android allows for cryptocurencies and that will make or break Apple for some users.
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:54:03
No, I do the same. Just common sense to do that when money is involved.
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:19:25
Across the world? How about using a credit card online with capcha?
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:00:21
I'm not surprised. Apple will allow apps that use [approved cryptocurrencies]( but there is no list of them. Last year, Apple applied for a [patent]( for their own centralized cryptocurrency. By removing any and all cryptocurrency apps from App Store, Apple can approve their own coin, none other.
This is why all developers for cryptocurrency need to develop software for Android and Windows Phone only. Apple's policy is too much and will keep the mainstream from and This industry needs to grow and Apple wants to ignore it or push it back.

Always keep them on your computer and backup the wallet.dat file. Anything online isn't as secure as it should be.
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:59:08
That is a flaw in all cryptocurrencies. Satoshi would be the one that can resolve this issue, IMO. Any crypto developer that can do that without ruining the decentralized nature of cryptos will be an immediate legend.
@_date: 2014-06-23 04:02:53
The first step to solving this problem won't be easy but everyone will agree: allow the Treasury Department to print money via US Mint as the Federal Reserve is no longer in control of the American dollar.

Let me try that:








I see your point.

I did tech support for Apple. They do hand hold these fools and don't allow them to really think or learn anything. Just be dependent on Apple and it will be OK. F-that.

I'm not a libertarian but I want some kind of libertarian response to my questions. Do you support an income tax on cryptocurrentcies if given in exchange for work? Do you support a sales tax on cryptocurrentcies like fiat money?
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:29:04
Mega-corps, a stable in cyberpunk, may form to merge the central banks so they could have a centralized digital currency linked your personal information. They can track purchases, your location, have an inventory of what you purchased, etc while they raid miners for "hacking", take over the mining computers to stage a 51% attack, and manipulate the block chain to transfer Bitcoins, Litecoins, etc to themselves so we're stuck with their version of digital currency.
@_date: 2014-06-30 12:49:01
Ayn Rand would love Bitcoin! As of now, Bitcoin is pure free market! The government is allowing a market based, pro-capitalist solution to make an appearance to solve this issue. The government is doing the best thing right now. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:41:12
So what coin has a proven record for investment, used as a currency, has plenty of developers, and support from major companies? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:45:07
My comment sense if you could read it. Tipping among Bitcoin users occurred before Dogecoin but tipping is more popular among Dogecoin users. 
No wonder this sub sucks ass.
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:19:53
Using BitCoin and altcoins can also reduce debt as well. Once people figure out the exchanges, they can use their debit cards to buy coins for online sales from their PC or mobile, anywhere, even at B&amp;Ms.
@_date: 2014-06-29 21:30:28
I'd go with Dogecoin and Potcoin.

I see why not. He'd have to release an update, form the block chain, and it would take effect.

Why not?
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:37:28
From my review of cryptocurrentcies from a tech view and I lack proper business skills but I see four main coins becoming useful. BitCoin for online purchases and investment. LiteCoin for small purchases online like Reddit gold or whatnot. DogeCoin for tips, charities, etc. DarkCoin for those that want extreme privacy. It may not happen but that is my half-assed take on it.
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:51:55
I want China to be in the BitCoin free market. It worked wonders with their trade with USA.

9/11 was a terrible attack on the United States. To secure our nation, some rights need to be in check to ensure the terrorists don't attack us again. What do you have to hide?
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:51:48
It be interesting to see how the government handles crytocurrentcies. I'm sure the IRS will be in involved. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 04:42:40
IRS considers cryptocurrency as property unless it's used as income aka paid in BitCoin.
It's true nature is several things, truthfully. It's a commodity that can be used to trade of items but you also own the bits as well with the private key.

Silk Road shows the potential Bitcoin has in aiding the free markets. B2B transactions occurring with minutes without a single third party is great! Silk Road is helping small business owners develop a customer base, network with other business owners, and no fees to the Chamber of Commerce. This is the kind of thing advocates need to point out in the media: Bitcoin helps every business succeed!
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:42:13
I never said it offended me. I'm just pointing it out. No reason to be insulting about it.

iMoney? I wish Apple could end the use of "i" for everything. Now, I get to use iMoney on my iPhone through iTunes and buy more storage on iCloud for my iMac. iVomit.
@_date: 2014-06-03 13:07:23
Oh, yes. They can test the hardware first and sell it to America and Europe for mining BitCoin, Dogecoin, etc. If I had money to place on a stock market, it would be ASIC companies.

9/11 is more important than the 4th amendment. As Bush said, it's just a damn piece of paper. There are free markets, corporations, and the wealthy to protect.

Perhaps but I think most companies would prefer BitCoin or LiteCoin.

Haters goin' to hate. I'm sure there are people that trust cryptocurrency more than the stock market.
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:24:53
Exactly. Why post transactions on Facebook anyways? It'd just link it to your information which is not the point of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency. Facebook already has Dogecoin and Reddcoin for tips so they can use that to learn the basics then move to Bitcoin when they're ready.

The developers of cryptocurrencies would merge their efforts to create a coin that can't be attacked by miners. A new standard would arise as this was foreseen. A new coin using Proof of Surveillance uses a computer to mine the coin based on the amount of online monitoring done by "them".

I thought they used DarkCoin
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:34:55
That is too true. BitCoin is more like day-trading while Dogecoin is like a savings account. Dogecoin is the foot in the door. It allows people to mine, tip, see transactions, and understand how cryptocurrencies work before they get into more serious ones. Awareness will only help the cryptocurrency industry and Dogecoin does all the PR for everyone. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:28:56
All cryptocurrentcy fans need to get along. Together, we can make it more widely accepted. Who knows, it may even replace credit cards for online transactions...or completely.

Let the market decide as Ayn Rand recommended.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:07:20
People are selling, and using, Bitcoin. That makes the price drop but it also means it may lead to more acceptance as well. Either way, the price will increase again. All part of a cycle like stocks and bonds.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:15:04
Correct but tipping was far more common among Dogecoin users at that time. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:39:20
Yes. It makes sense. However, Apple did [patent]( their own cryptocurrency called iMoney. That would take longer than three days.
@_date: 2014-06-29 03:29:08


A true American.
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:30:44
True. This may lead to regulations for cryptocurrencies. You know, for your own safety.
