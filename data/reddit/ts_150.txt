Remember that you don't have to buy bitcoins in ones or twos - I have about 0.8 bitcoins from a lot of different smaller transactions. 
For a guy like you with that money, I'd ask yourself what you'd do with it otherwise. If you're just going to put it in a bank to save then the money isn't really doing anything. 
I put around £300 ($500) in bitcoin so far and with the current price so low because of recent events I might buy more if it goes lower. 
Bitcoin is gonna become big and there's a finite amount so getting some now is recommended if you want to benefit from it long term. 
Either way, my personal advice is to get some soon (hopefully the price will drop even more). Even if bitcoins don't go back up to $5000 per coin you'll still make your money back if you're unhappy with your investment later. 
I'd recommend coinbase for buying the coins (yes the fees are big but it's usually a decent place to buy, even if they often make you buy at a slightly higher price). Then immediately move your coins to a wallet (I'd recommend exodus) because that means you have those coins absolutely - no technical issue at coinbase can lose all of them. 
Then just sit tight and wait for the price to go back up. Don't watch the price religiously for the next week - this is a long term investment that will see best returns in months/years from now. 
Just hodl! Don't panic sell if the price goes down, just sit tight and wait. 
However it is your money. If you're gonna need it next month for something, keep it and don't invest. But if you're gonna keep it sitting around, invest it so it can do something useful. Just make sure you make informed decisions! Don't listen to every internet troll telling you to panic sell every time the price drops a tiny bit. 
Whatever you decide to do - good luck!

Price just dipped down to almost $3810, moved to $3845 and is now headed back down
Might start buying now....

Depends what you bought at and also what your aims are. 
1) if you're in this for the long run then you've done well - the price is lowish at the moment and will go back up after all the FUD dies down. Eventually when each bitcoin is worth tens of thousands you'll be reaping the benefits
2) if you're hoping to buy low and sell high (basically trying to be a trader) then you've done ok. I personally think the price will go lower due to all the continuing FUD and also the amount that people have panic sold. So if you have anything spare to invest I'd say save it for the £2250-2500 ($2880-$3200) range or even lower if you're brave
Just make sure you move your coins to a wallet!!!!!
I'd recommend exodus - I've just started using it and it's very secure and easy. 
Sites that sell cryptocurrencies are notorious for taking down accounts and confiscating people's coins. If you've invested that much into it then move them to a wallet.

Oops lol. Roughly the same meaning though

Bitcoin can be used for a very limited amount of transactions at the moment. But you can sell bitcoins, and then put that money back into your bank account. 
I wouldn't recommend that though because of the fees to move and withdraw the money. 
I'd say it's better to keep the bitcoins rather than remove the gains. Especially since the price will probably go up to a max of $5000 per 1BTC for the next year or two. (Although I could be completely wrong - that's just the general opinion from redditers and other people I've spoken to). 
If you're only gonna put in say $500 then don't expect to earn more than a $10-50 overall gain. The biggest gains will be in the far future. 
I think you're overestimating how much bitcoins will grow. Sure they're gonna be big, but not in the next few months. 
I would treat it as a savings account, but only to put money in and see how it grows - the price of bitcoins fluctuates so much and the fees are so much that you wouldn't make any money

Coinbase only accepts SEPA bank transfers and credit/debit cards with 3D security (the gold square on the card). I don't think prepaid cards work 
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:24:53
I think you might be able to use coinbase
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:07:00
I use it at the moment. It stores your coins offline which I like plus it has two back up systems. 
I'd recommend it. 
It's pretty easy to get so I'd say try it out and see what you think

Well I believe it's because they assume you're not gonna leave it open around those thieving bitcoin experts that are following you. If you're that worried about security you could just close the app and then login when you come back
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:55:47
Well that's because you need a password to login to your exodus app.

This has happened a few times before but the value always goes back up

Hey I'm from the UK as well (although I'm currently travelling through the US). 
I've always used coinbase just because it's the easiest to use. Yeah the fees are stupidly high but because bitcoins are gonna go back up soon I'm not worried. 
(I'm in this for the long run - I've put £250 into BTC and £50 into LTC whilst this dip is happening but I'll continue to put more in when I can.)
As soon as you buy the coins, put them in a wallet!!!!!
DO NOT LEAVE THEM IN YOUR COINBASE WALLET!!!
coinbase is notorious for shutting down accounts for no reason and confiscating your coins. 
I use exodus because it's easy to use, looks nice, and you can easily switch between cryptocurrencies in the app (it's for windows and mac, they're currently working on an iPhone/android app). 
Storing coins in a wallet like this means you own them totally. If every exchange like coinbase goes down then you still have control of your coins, plus because it stores them offline on your laptop/computer it's a lot safer than storing them online. 
Buying £300 worth of bitcoins is a good start but don't expect to be a millionaire any time soon. 
At the moment you can probably expect a £50 return within 3 months (that's just by my calculation, I think we'll be up to £4000ish per coin in three months time). 
I'd suggest playing for the long run, putting any spare money you have into bitcoins, especially when there's a dip like now. Don't do anything rash though - and remember bitcoins are very volatile so they will go down as well as up. Don't panic sell if there's FUD like now, just HODL! (FUD is fear/unrest/despair - where people spread fear about bitcoins and try to get people to panic sell. HODL just means hold (it's a long story but everyone says hodl now as an inside joke) - even if the price drops (like it's doing now) don't panic sell. The price will go back up like it has dont a million times before. Always make well thought out, informed decisions. 
Any questions just DM me, I like explaining this kind of stuff, especially because it would've been helpful if someone did it to me when I was starting out. 
Good luck with your bitcoins! 
PS remember to get an offline wallet and don't panic sell
