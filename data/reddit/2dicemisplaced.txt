Too much "You're not using SegWit!!"
Not enough answers to the question "Why use SegWit?"
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:59:42
Exactly. Everything I read about SegWit just comes off as cavalier.

True, but hearing about SegWit (still very few transactions), LN and Schnorr has been like a girlfriend on a date who keeps telling you how awesome the sex is going to be when you get to her place, only to have her fall asleep when you get there.
Whenever the fees get high or transactions get slow, it's always "BUT BUT BUT LN! SCHNORR!!!"

How would you weight each variable?
EDIT: Word choice. (In a six-word sentence, I know.)

At what point does "argumentum ad satoshidum" graduate to the level of rhetorical fallacy in bitcoin discussions? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:11:35
I'm supposed to believe that Bitcoin Uncensored is a big deal, right?

Vinegar is supposed to be an effective counteragent. That's why carrying around with you in Brazil will get you stopped by police.

I look at it like this: TheDAO was Ethereum's too-big-to-fail moment, but the hard fork took place on the basis of consensus and freedom-of-association. 
The real-world "too big to fail" of the late '00s wasn't driven by consensus but a single organization with a monopoly on violence. (You might know it by its charming euphemism, "government.") Even perfectly healthy banks were coerced into participation in TARP money. After all, we _couldn't_ have well-run banks market themselves on the basis of not taking a bailout, right? That's not fair! _This is capitalism!_ /s

"I don't know how on-the-record we are..."
As he looks STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA!
Brilliantly planned...

I almost inappropriately squealed in happiness at the rational way this was presented. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:30:05
What sites do you recommend, then? Not trying to challenge you or defend Coindesk. Genuinely curious...
@_date: 2016-06-17 12:46:28
Wow... Downvoted for *this*...
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:13:24
I like Bitcoin Magazine's reporting. Reddit's constant stream of "Why are my transactions not going through?" and "I lost my private keys!" makes it tiresome, though.

Krugman is a case of "If at first you don't succeed, learn to enjoy doing it badly."

Thanks for the tip!

Would love an ELI5 on how this is done...

But do they _compete_ in the strictest sense? Bitcoin and the R3 approach solve for two different problems, it would seem. No one reasonably thinks that big banks could leverage blockchain tech's benefits using bitcoin, right? (Though I would prefer that they'd use a permissionless blockchain.)
Also... What does R3 provide that, say, Hyperledger Project does not?
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:05:01
I don't understand why R3 is positioned as a "bitcoin competitor."
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:27:27
It may take 10 minutes. It may take 10 days. Depends on the size of the mempool and whether the tooth fairy adds the right amount of fee. 
Or chances are it will be a permissioned blockchain and all of the other tooth fairies will participate. They'll each pay $250k/year and participate in a number of high-profile tests.

Hear hear. Triumphalism is unbecoming. UASF-like football-spiking makes a divided community more fragile.

Um... "Six fucking people" (more or less) decide Core's direction. 
Everyone hates "centralization"... until it's _their_ preferred forms of centralization at stake.

Agreed. I have used almost all of my bitcoin on purchases and donations.

I am 100% certain that all communications generated from that list will:
* Be totally constructive
* Completely free of threats
* Not generated by a troll army
* Make my evident sarcasm baseless
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:34:38
Only insofar as it relates to other currencies, *NOT* stocks.

I guess I'm often left wondering "What objective does a private blockchain accomplish that cannot be addressed by more conventional means?"

I'm trying my best to hate this idea, but... I... just... can't...
But yeah... Would rather have it sent to charity than burned. Like a job retraining foundation. "My lazy ass will help someone get off of theirs!"

I think if we looked at old transcripts, CNN was probably equally dismissive of the Internet and the Web. 
But they'll absolutely tell us everything we need to know about the missing Malaysian airliner, complete with "black hole" theories.

* SegWit2x activates
* The UASF effort can pat itself on the back as doing its job to force miners to accept SegWit
* People can change their Twitter IDs back to normal
