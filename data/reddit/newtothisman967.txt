If you don't verify your account how will anyone every know..
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:15:03
well said.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:28:06
lol $80... You really fucked up 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:10:52
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:10
This is real
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:37
Leave the $60 for sure. Wether you invest more is up to you. Do some research and figure out if you want the crypto world to be part of your life.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:43
mine is working for now... bitcoin is crashing hard. 16k
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:16:38
You are saying you pay tax every time you trade BTC for LTC as an example?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:56:19
You just buy and sell in crypto. You don't need a verified account to buy and sell on Binance for example.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:52:14
I bought some bitcoin cash.. its here to stay wether we like it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:25
If you want to do this sell high and buy low. Right now high is 11.5k+ and low is 11k and under. This is also risky. But i definitely would not suggest selling when you see its dropping cause thats what everyone does and thats how you lose.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:51:07
What are you smoking?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:17:30
buy a bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:34:20
The worst thing you can do is sell. TRUST.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:15:50
What I generally tell people is that if you are hodling more than 3k-4k get a hard wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:55:27
lol its impossible because in order to sell something you need someone to buy it
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:05:31
I have not sold any of my Bitcoin. But I certainly have started investing in bcash. 
And I don't use crypto for payments right now. I hope to in the future. Too volatile right now. I could end up spending 100$ on a big mac combo.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:24:32
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:06:34
I did not mean to brag or sound cocky in any way haha. Im investing as a hobby. Im would not consider myself rich! At least not yet..... ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:45:02
you said you "really fucked up". I guess we have two completely different understandings of what that means.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:54
the world is ending. its all a hoax!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:59
VISA, MASTERCARD.. YOU GET POINTS!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:54
2-3 days
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:43
we just hit 17k now... only 3k to go. Should take 20-25 minutes at this rate
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:59:41
I just made an account so I can buy a bunch of IOTA. Seems pretty good so far. Easy to use. Easy to register. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:59:29
For now I am storing it on binance. I will probably post about this once I acquire more of it. I know my nano s does not support it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:00:54
Make sure to give 30% extra if you are buying now..
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:54:40
apparently they have regular professional audits lol but I know what you mean.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:22:05
Can someone explain to me how this pumps bitcoin levels?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:02:31
Just 500 for now at $2.09. Planning on getting more.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:14
just sell for another coin.. then re-buy
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:07:33
Its still considered a payment. So still illegal.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:04
its at 16.5 now
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:12
dont sell and just buy more if you want to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:43:14
Everyone! My 14 year old cousin named Sara just called me asking how she can invest.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:51:20
Okay so if all USDT is actually backed by USD like its supposed to be this would not be an issue? If I understand correctly the only way to get tether is to buy it with USD or other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:04:13
I wish it was as simple as sending you some bitcoin for one lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:19:55
currency exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:10:16
its will go back down to 9-9-5k most probably. There is a lot of money to be made.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:13:49
thanks a lot. going to place the order now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:45:40
I usually sell off 25% of my bitcoin when i think there will be a dip. It has been very profitable for me so far. But its a gamble just like anything 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:06:33
Did you choose the upgraded shipping? its like $60 shipping for 3-5 days and $30 shipping for 7-21 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:31:04
sell before the dip
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:30:13
Segwit was cancelled.... and now square is doing tests with Bitcoin.. Could very well be do to these things
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:39:35
I have been in the past ;). it takes some getting used too. times like this have me chillin...
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:19
people are panic selling. coinbase is down again. when it comes back be prepared for more panic selling
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:12:43
Awesome, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:56:38
Yes with 25% of my Bitcoin. It is interesting to do if you are willing to gamble. I have gone into crypto since day one with the idea that I might leave with nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:21:27
give me her address ill send her more lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:55
I sold at 11.2 then bought back at 10.75 then sold again and 10.4... so not currently ahah
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:00:34
English is not my first language... What do you not understand. you sell 100 bitcoins for 830k then the price drops by 200 and you buy back your position for 810k. You just made 20k.....
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:29
Thanks! So if the ledger apps/company go down for wtvr reason. Would there still be a way to access the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:20:23
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:41:48
Rephrasing the question to show how relative it is. It all depends who you ask.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:31:21
do people consider 8k a lot of money?
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:12:42
its here to stay
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:33:36
nope just looking to improve my position. Might be wrong so just bought back in. Sold at 11.2 bought back at 10.75.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:04:25
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:50:07
If you have lets say 100 bitcoin worth and sell them for $8300 and the you buy them back at the $200 dip at $8100 per coin. Well you just made 20k
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:21:38
big time. I think were going to see prices below 9k
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:28:54
get something signed on paper.... he might be owing you a lot of money
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:44:49
I just bought one directly from ledger and it looks exactly like the top one.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:13:53
Didn't realize we hit it earlier. Thought it was just under. I guess I'm off to bed!
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:25:51
If you have a lot bitcoins you can easily see how you can make some easy money with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:09:12
Buy $100 every ten days instead.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:22:18
already dropped 600
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:14:28
Send my your coins. I will keep them safe from him.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:04:20
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:16:58
for $20 worth you really do not need to worry. I would say buy a hard wallet if you have a couple thousand. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:40:33
Why would you ever use Bitcoin to pay on Amazon? Credit cards give you points and are 100% safe. I do not get the concept of paying for things with Bitcoin yet. I received $2200 in cash back last year from my credit card and have made a lot more just holding Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:06:23
Would a hard wallet like the ledger nano s credit you both chains?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:18:14
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:57:43
True. I only use it to buy Bitcoin and then I transfer to a hard wallet for the long haul. I guess its not going to be efficient if you are planning on doing a lot of trades. 
I just know its easy to use and withdrawals and deposits can be instant.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:37:25
A good place to start would be Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:42:22
Super easy to use. You can add funds to it instantly with most CAD banks. You can also withdraw funds with interac e-transfer. Im pretty sure you will need to get approved first though. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:35:09
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:45:39
Thanks a lot! Your response has been super helpful to me and I'm sure it will be to others. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:18:52
Thanks!
