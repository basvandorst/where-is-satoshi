Government and regulation probably may not stand a chance against decentralized systems.

Quality post. Keep up.

You should read about forks.

I am planning to.
I just asked here because there is a lot of desinformation and I lack the time to search for it. 
Even here you can find people disagreeing about the fees.

Does Coinbase use Segwit? Should I change to another exchange?

Bitcoin development is centralized.
Soft fork adoption is up to the community.

Thanks for your answer.
If I were to move 1 BTC from Coinbase to another exchange or some wallet how much would I pay?
I am a bit scared of paying unexpected comissions.

Then day when governments try to freeze or hurt cryptos will come. If your crypto is decentralized you are safe.

Segwit + Lightning &gt; Segwit2X
In IT when you have a shortage of a resource increasing it will only work temporarily... Until you need to increase it again.
The best  solution and the one that scales the most is the one that actually fixes it.
Bitcoin transactions will explode exponentially as soon as it gets to be used by the average Joe.
Doubling the address space would solve it for a while... But with a slight overhead and not for ever.

Sorry, I am on the phone.

It is not so simple. He has to "average" transactions to a million.
