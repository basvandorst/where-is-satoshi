If somebody has a solution for the trust problem as having physical bitcoins require a centralized entity, then sure.

Or they're just simply extremely careless.

Apps are being developed for people to be able to send btc through sms, assuming telecom companies are online.

Not everyone is comfortable being paid with something that could be worth less in a certain timespan.

If I remember correctly, only their hot wallets are insured, which is only 2% of the total funds they're holding.
@_date: 2019-03-08 15:20:05
Thanks! For the mention! Still trying to increase the list.

Oh boy. This meme has been a curse eversince.

That wasn't the exact quote though.  It says:


Which I quite agree on.

I'm just surprised that the QR code hasn't been re-painted on by someone.
Congratulations though, you definitely deserve it.
@_date: 2019-03-19 16:25:35
Yes. For sure. It's just a potential option if it's not a 100% blackout.

Any links to the author?

I was so ready to press the downvote button.

It's pretty simple. If you don't want to, then don't use it. At the meantime, it's a decent temporary sort of "band aid" solution for those who actually wants to use BTC regardless.

With that amounts of money you should've invested a small amount for a hardware wallet mate.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:43:36
Gotta love those treznor hardware wallets.

This isn't a shitposting subreddit though.
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:43:57
That's some big brain stuff right there.

Which could be potentially worth a lot more in the future
@_date: 2019-02-17 00:54:38
The shape of that heart looks weird.
@_date: 2019-04-28 06:38:32
Yes. But significantly a lot harder and costlier.
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:26:48
At least you're honest I guess.
@_date: 2019-09-10 08:04:29
Wasabi or ChipMixer
@_date: 2019-09-25 09:31:10
Yep. Baseless claims are definitely great.

Bitcoin can literally stay above $10k for a hundred years and it still would be possible for it to drop below $10k(though a lot more unlikely).
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:41:35
"if bitcoin dropped to $5000 you'd say buy it?"
Duh. Since when was buying at a higher price better?
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:12:26
You had 0.5 BTC but couldn't put a small amount on the side for a Nano S?
@_date: 2019-09-07 04:06:52
This is extremely risky of a portfolio allocation.
I love it.
