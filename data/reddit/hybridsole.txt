I predict that most economic activity will cost (in dollar terms) less than $0.50/tx for the next few years. Right now we are still at anywhere from $0.05-0.15 depending on the size in bytes and how quickly you want to get into a block. Though most wallets are not very good at guessing the right fee, and so some pay way too much or too little. Fee calculation will improve over time. 
Once we get past $0.25/tx to get into a block, we will see further reductions in the number of non-essential transactions. By this point, seg-wit will provide some much needed breathing room and the market will find an equilibrium between $0.20-0.30. 
Of course, these fees will be denominated in satoshis, not dollars, so the exchange rate for Bitcoin will greatly impact the fee value in dollar terms. These are just predictions for the next 12-24 months, they could be way off. But I can't imagine a scenario where it costs more than $1 to get into a block unless we see unprecedented growth in adoption. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:24:16
It's all relative.  If the price of BTC doubles, so will the fee in $ terms.    A higher fee means small or non-essential transactions will go down, offsetting the impact. It's simple supply/demand. In the case of available space in a block, supply is fixed (until segwit) so demand will fluctuate based on how much it costs.  
For example, today you can use Fiverr.com, pay with Bitcoin for a $5 service and less than 5% goes to the miners. If that fee becomes 10% of the transaction or more, then you'll probably use another payment method. Or you will opt to "top up" your account with larger amounts of Bitcoin rather than a new TX each time.  
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:00:30


Non-essential transactions can still be done using Bitcoin, they just don't need to be published on the blockchain for all eternity.  There are, and will be, more ways to spend BTC without taking up space in a block. 
Just like with TCP/IP, not every person or website needs a dedicated IP address.


You can use another crypto, but currently not on Fiverr, or pretty much any site that accepts Bitcoin.  Your choice is Visa/MC/Amex/Paypal/Bitcoin.  Oh, and lets say they do accept another crypto...That crypto will likely be priced in BTC to obtain an exchange rate. So you'll be paying for a TX fee on the altcoin network, then another hidden TX fee to convert the altcoin to BTC, and finally the merchant will convert BTC to USD (or their local currency).

Also one needs to factor the 2% annual maintenance fee.  If an investor at age 30 buys 100 shares of GBTC (10 BTC originally), he/she will end up with around 5.5 BTC at the point of retirement. If I'm doing the math correctly that is a 45% loss in the underlying asset over 30 years.  Don't get me wrong, GBTC is a great vehicle for people to use on a smaller time frame to realize tax advantages, but long term it doesn't make sense. We will need to see more competitors and ETFs enter the market to bring those fees down hopefully.

I think the fact that most people do not save money is a result of a few things. First, most people know deep down that if they save dollars, their buying power will go down over time through inflation. We are taught in school that $100 right now is more valuable than $100 a year from now.  In addition, everyone is barraged with cheap loans in the form of $0 down, 0% APR for the first several months for nearly every purchase.  
As bitcoin enters their consciousness, they begin to realize for the first time that there is a transferable asset which tends to go up in value over time, can be used in any country in the world, and can be stored without needing physical security or trusting a third party to hold.  Up until now the only thing close to that was gold, which is not very transferable and requires physical security.  It's no wonder that many people who get into bitcoin for the first time say something along the lines of "Finally, I have a reason to save money".  
The main challenge here is that it takes a pretty considerable technical understanding of bitcoin to go from point A to point B. We are already seeing it happen to those who are curious, but because bitcoin does not have a marketing department or budget, it will not happen overnight.

Nobody is forced to buy shares of GBTC, but the fact that it exists is huge for anyone who wants to use the tax benefits of an IRA (not to mention the lowered complexity of not having to manage your own keys).  If people didn't care about it or think the 2% fees were outrageous, why is it currently trading at a more than $250 premium over the cost of BTC? 
You can make fun of the fact that it's on an OTC market, but that's because any other route would be stonewalled by the SEC.

By that I mean coins touting "free" or nearly free transactions when there is no demand for block space on that network.

There are other issues besides the threat of gov't control. For example, miners that have access to faster bandwidth can bully other miners off the network through block propagation attacks.  E.g. filling the blocks with large transactions to the point where it adds several second delay to the low-bandwidth competition, giving them a competitive advantage.  
It also prolongs the development and adoption of *real* scaling solutions that allow orders of magnitude more traffic (millions of tx/sec).  
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:35:22
The GUI wallet has no bearing on any exchanges ability to incorporate segwit. The developer specs have been out for months and we’ve seen many competent teams incorporate it into their platform. If there is an exchange or wallet provider who needs the Core GUI to support segwit before they can, that exchange has no competency to be writing software to hold user funds. 
The bech32 format is the one thing that does need a little more maturing, but only Electrum has jumped the gun so far on that. Regular Segwit addresses are not seeing any problems (starting with 3).

Bcash isn't processing 8mb blocks. Their blocks are measured in kilobytes because very few people are using that chain. You can bet if every Bcash block was full, the network would experience a lot of chaos.  That's 1.1GB per day of storage which also gets rebroadcast to other nodes (bandwidth usage is exponential). The daily bandwidth for a full node processing 8mb blocks every 10 minutes would exceed just about every bandwidth cap for any residence in the US.

So then what happens when, in six months, when another 10 million people come in?   Fees will rise to the exact same as they are today except a few things would be different:
1. The community would be faced with yet another hard fork, likely contentious, because what would the correct block size be? Is it a gradual block size increase, static increase, or some kind of auto-scaling solution?  How do we determine which is correct or when to deploy?  Do we include other protocol enhancements that aren't directly related to scaling?
2. Wallets / exchanges would delay implementing Segwit or smarter fee calculations because of temporary reduced fee pressure.
3. Protocol work on LN / MAST / Schnorr and other would be less urgent and the hard fork may drain resources from these layer-2 enhancements.
4. CPU/Memory/Bandwidth demands would overwhelm many nodes running on consumer hardware/internet, thus reducing centralization.

The parallel to bitcoin is that we have congested roads and long wait times, but in a growing and vibrant city with infrastructure and buildings all along these roads.
To alleviate this, we have engineered a very efficient highway system that can handle *trillions* of cars without impacting the existing infrastructure, but it's not yet complete.  Instead, some people want to rip up the roads, infrastructure, and buildings to make the roads a little bit wider because the "highway is years away".  And they want to do this knowing full well that ripping up everything to build a wider road is, at best, a short term band-aid on the traffic problem.

Fees are outside of anyone’s control. Block size is a security parameter, it doesn’t determine how much someone is willing to pay for admission into a block. One could also argue that 10 minute block time is also a reason why fees are so high, but that doesn’t make it true.

Sure it’s been tested. We know the network can propagate blocks every 2 minutes. This has happened several times in bitcoin’s history. The network has technically never had large blocks. So it’s already safer as being something that naturally occurs.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:23:37
The current developers didn't set anything.  If you want to know why bitcoin doesn't have larger blocks, it's because satoshi initially set the parameters to between 500kb to 1mb, which is presumably what he felt at the time was a reasonable upper limit of transaction throughput for computers in ~2010.  
Nobody has *done* anything to bitcoin.  However, due to some clever workarounds, we are now able to fit up to 4mb of transactions within the 1mb total limit with the addition of segregated witness as a soft fork.  This buys some time while second layer solutions can be assessed.

It's not just forging the coin, but the hologram is incredibly intricate, as well as getting the firstbits to appear under the hologram *just right*.  It would take 10's of thousands of dollars to try.
Here's the kicker, though.  Many of the existing Casascius coins are held by the relatively small community of collectors. In order to forge one, they would have to own the coin themselves otherwise it's possible the real owner would pop up. Each coin has some kind of backstory, and some are even PGP traced back to the original purchase from Mike Caldwell.  
Sure, it's possible, but this is much harder than forging a Silver Eagle, mostly as a result of the hologram.

It's very difficult to abstract what we think Bitcoin is today, to how it will serve society in the future.

Not if you're a large miner.  All you have to do is continue to fill the mempool with transactions small enough that they won't reasonably be picked up into blocks.

I don't think you know how this is going to evolve, nor do I know.  But there seems to be consensus that Lightning networks will still be as cryptographically sound as the mainnet, and also decentralized where you own your own keys.  
I was once a big blocker myself, but at some point one must realize that blockchains cannot scale without some segmentation and layering.

That's not accurate.  Coinbase keeps one of three keys.

The third key belongs entirely to the user and is not stored by Coinbase.  Reference:

Encourage efficient use of the block space by demanding wallets and service providers implement Segwit, demand wallets and service providers to use more intelligent fee calculations, exchanges giving customers the ability to choose priority or non-priority withdrawals (some users are not in a hurry).  
A temporary band-aid to raise the block size at this point is going to be contentious and create a chain split. A block increase may be non-contentious only after we have exhausted all available soft fork options.  And even if we had, say 8mb blocks, it would not take long before we are back in the same situation (high fees, congestion, etc) without layer-2.

The repo maintainers don’t get to decide if or when we hard fork. It’s a collaborative decision among a lot of stakeholders. Reading the dev list would show you this. There are very legitimate reasons why engineers and node operators overwhelmingly opposed 2x.
4mb is the new theoretical limit for transactions. Currently the number of wallet providers and exchanges who leverage this capacity increase is limited, but fee pressure will ultimately encourage this efficient usage of the blockchain. 
Everything regarding bitcoin being crippled or somehow there being a conspiracy to harm bitcoin through conservative approaches to scaling is entirely overblown. Unfortunately for those whose business models rely on sending low value transactions, they will likely not survive this reality of inherent scaling challenges of bitcoin. Likewise those who promised free and instant payments to the world will be disappointed, at least until sustainable scaling solutions are fully implemented on a secondary layer. There is no base block size which can reasonably satisfy the usage for billions of people, but a secondary layer can easily handle trillions of transactions.

It's not like they are subject to a brute force attack like a brain wallet, since there are massive hurdles to getting access to the user seeds.

Keep in mind these are financial networks designed to store value. In many cases its storing billions of dollars of actual value.  When a change is introduced, there are bugs that can go undetected for years.  The reason why I cringe when I hear bitcoin needs to accelerate progress is because of how devastating the consequences could be.  Imagine a town has a suspension bridge, and the engineers get together to decide how many lanes or cars it can support, but the public wants to hold a vote to say "well, we need to reduce traffic congestion so let's double the number of lanes on the bridge!".    I, for one, do not want to let these decisions to be made by people who do not have the experience to understand the consequences of these decisions. Additionally, I do not want to find out what the theoretical breaking limits of bitcoin are.  It makes sense to pay a little more for transaction fees now, and figure out a way to do it more efficiently and with less disruption than ripping up the roads and doubling the lanes of traffic to achieve temporary benefits.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with the Keynesian theory around economies  as a whole and inflationary spending. They certainly do appear to have their usefulness. But Bitcoin is decidedly not a Keynesian-based economic system. It is Austrian based.  So when you opt-in to the bitcoin economy, one is submitting themselves to the permutations that come with a gold-like economy. 
That's not to say that cryptocurrencies or bitcoin will destroy the notion of inflationary spending and quantitative easing tools used by central banks.  There are ways to mitigate this through stable coins, and attaching fiat anchors to tokens within sidechains, and so these economies which are anchored in the inflationary systems can still be supported in a crypto economy.  They can even be supported by Bitcoin on a sidechain.

Unlike other coins, when bitcoin launches a new feature, it doesn't try to embed _another_ token into that feature (along with a scammy fundraiser and ICO).  It uses good old classic Bitcoin, baby.  But because they forgo the $100 million dollar crowdfunds with these features (and promises of investment riches to the suckers who buy the token), development takes a little bit longer, and it doesn't get as much press releases. The features don't get released as slick, colorful wallets with plug and play features.

Let me just say this regarding Bitcoin XT, the fork wars, and censorship.
Bitcoin XT was a consensus breaking upgrade which threatened to increase the base block size ultimately to 8GB (in 2036).  It was not properly vetted among the core development team, saw wide disagreement among the thought leaders at the time, and instead was thrust upon the community through massive amounts of campaigning and brigading. The moderation we saw on this subreddit is a result of this threat upon the network.  It was a very confusing time because I was wrapped up in the hysteria that Hearn and Gavin helped create. Gavin's credibility, specifically because he worked with Satoshi, was very hard to disagree with. I am ashamed to admit that I ran a Bitcoin XT node in 2015.  
Looking back on it, I almost wonder if 8 gigabyte blocks was the ultimate plan to kill bitcoin and force it into the hands of a few datacenter operators.  Who knows?  To think what kind of future bitcoin would have with that much centralization pressure on the base blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-06-30 10:23:43
That's an interesting stat, which will inevitably correct itself over time. With any new technology the first few generations have an expensive unit cost, but come down significantly as it scales with popularity (this is true with computers, plasma/lcd screens, etc)
With Bitcoin time and usage will take care of this. The block halvings will eventually the reduce the cost per tx every 4 years, and the cost per tx will go down as the # of Tx's per block increases with increased adoption.   Some factors which will facilitate this reduction in tx price will be the block size increase and the emergence of side chains for micro payments. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:11:46
Sure, if you want to randomly throw out dates. Yes, the long term trend is downward. People are dumbasses and sold their bitcoins for altcoins last year.  That's why the overall trend is downward. It's not because there's any inherent weakness or flaws in BTC. Quite the contrary, its secondary network is on the path to eat the lunch of every "cheap fee" altcoin that exists.  
@_date: 2018-08-15 12:15:59
I'm not sure why you are disparaging Monero compared to any of the other 1400 projects which are most definitely more scammy than XMR.   Your criticisms of XMR are very reminiscent of someone criticizing BTC in the early days. "It has such a small market cap. Nobody uses it to buy anything." 
The right criticisms to make on an altcoin project should be focused on whether there was a pre-mine, instamine, or token sale, a centralized dev team, or poor engineering/coding execution.  Additionally one needs to see decentralized mining, development, and wide support across exchanges and marketplaces (with an actual, tangible business case for acquiring and using the token).  Monero is exceptional by all of these standards.  I'm not saying it is better than Bitcoin, but your criticisms to me come off more as defensiveness


Tell that to the thousands of people who have seen their Coinbase account banned because they sent BTC to/from an gambling site, dark net site, or anything deemed to be "not acceptable" by Coinbase's chain analysis firms.  Relying on centralized mixers is not the answer. Consider this: Mixers are mixing up your coins with other coins from drug dealers, pornographers, etc.  Is that really the best solution you can come up with?  Telling some users of bitcoin they need to mix their coins up with the other nefarious users of bitcoin to be private?  That's unacceptable to me.  Privacy by default is the only way you can prevent a smaller subset of users from being singled out. XMR is the only currency that achieves this.

If people were not focused on fleeting metrics like TPS or transaction fees, they would not have missed the forest for the trees.

This is not a victory lap, or a celebration of bitcoin's dominance. A lot of people have lost a lot of money. Much of it was lost unnecessarily through misinformation campaigns about the state of bitcoin's network, and through temporary spam attacks designed to sow seeds of doubt into the core development philosophy.

Gavin is a skilled engineer but also a politician. If I remember right, he served on his local community council for years. While on the surface, there's nothing wrong with that (and in most circumstances would be an honorable thing to do), it does show that he has a desire for controlling the way things are done -- which probably explains why he didn't fit into a community project like bitcoin once it grew beyond his grasp.  It also helps explain his appeals to authority. Not only would he prefer to have authority over you, but he then is duped into people he perceives as having more authority. The CIA, for example, which is what scared satoshi away.  Or the way in which he wanted to know Satoshi's identity from the very beginning.  He never really could get past why someone would not want to use this invention to become a celebrity.  Lastly, he appealed to the authority of a con-man and bully in Craig Wright, revealing to the world just how foolish Gavin really is.

Hurts that centralized scams can make up statistics like "activity" artificially created through "stress tests"? Especially centralized coins who have their entire supply controlled by a few parties. They can easily spam their blockchain for free (essentially) to create these numbers.  Then they create these ranking websites to reverse engineer the numbers to make their scam appear to be legitimate, even though the _market_ clearly disagrees.  
What matters, my friend, at the end of the day is the money.  2018 has seen nothing but money leaving altcoins and entering back into BTC.  You can continue to bet against this trend at your own peril, and ignore actual scaling improvements and the consensus of the smartest engineers in the field.

They don't pick your password, it's chosen by you.  It is recommended to use a strong password, and yes you're correct it should be used carefully since CB has no way to decrypt the key in the event you lose it.  
They are a smart company because they know some people will never trust their coins fully to an exchange, and so they provide (in my opinion) the most user friendly multi-sig option.  Not only does it allow you to store your coins securely, but all of their vaults have a 48 hour time lock feature.  So even if you're hacked and someone gains access to your account, your phone, and your passwords, they still have a 48 hour window for you to cancel that transaction.  I have not seen any other wallet offer a feature like that.  
Compared to the trezor, keepkey, coinkite, mycelium, etc etc etc, nothing is quite as secure as the Coinbase multi-sig vault because it's the only one that passes the $5 wrench test.  You can beat a password out of me and take my trezor coins instantly, but you have to kidnap me for 48 hours to take funds out of my coinbase vault.

Yes and Yes.  Bitcoin core codebase is a meritocracy that requires years of collaboration to reach the upper echelon and to be trusted with the _financial_ aspects of the code.  The developers, cryptographers, and protocol experts supporting bitcoin are among the best in the world however their messaging and PR hasn't always been the best.   
Bitcoin is not only advancing the field of cryptocurrency, but it is also advancing the field of cryptography overall.  The reason you do not hear about these advancements is because they are not easily digestible into press releases intended for pumping the price.  But altcoins do these types of press releases for vapid, unecessary features every single day.

I wonder how many people lost many after Gavin tweeted that bitcoin cash was the project he most believed in when he started working with satoshi (paraphrasing).  
Turns out that Gavin was an early and important contributor, but unable to hang around when technical heavyweights joined the fold who had ideas which superseded his.

It will come. Believe it or not, larger blocks is a popular idea among core devs.  But the devil is in the details: How quickly should we raise it, how big should they be, how do we activate it, should we include other features within a hard fork, etc etc.  The answer is that these ideas are still being worked out.  A longer term block size solution is most likely the solution that makes the most sense (e.g. it grows by X % each year or  based on median number of transactions).

It's not a measurable metric. Unfortunately we can't say "decentralization is at a 3 today, we should try to bump it up to a 5".  What we can do is promote security parameters which encourage a wide distribution of nodes and mining.  The only way to allow this, in my mind, is for a full node to be supported on a "consumer" desktop PC and internet.  There is so much room for interpretation within that one definition. To me it's all about bandwidth because my ISP caps me at 1000GB/month.  Supporting a bitcoin full node is achievable right now, but only barely.  Assuming we can see growth in bandwidth and overall data caps disappearing, increasing the base block size should be a possibility down the road.

It is only after years of trolls coming onto this subreddit after each altcoin pump to proclaim the death of bitcoin (as a result of the scaling decisions), that I delight in the reverse movement.


I'm far from a bitcoin maximalist. In fact, I own several cryptos, assets, and tokens.  Believe it or not I still own most of my bcash too. It's the people who proclaimed that these coins would overtake bitcoin that I take issue with and who need to learn this lesson.  There is plenty of room for complimentary projects to co-exist alongside BTC (XMR, LTC, and ETH to name a few).  Perhaps even bcash if they rebranded and got rid of the scammer/AXA/coreans contingency.

Whether it makes sense for most people to run full nodes, the fact that you can do so on consumer hardware and internet is an important point of distinction.  Regardless, the debate and path forward has been decided.  Bitcoin will scale by making the chain weight more efficient and by encouraging layer-2 protocols.  At some point a base block size increase will also happen when it makes sense from an engineering standpoint.

They each fill very different and necessary purposes.   Bitcoin can never implement the level of privacy that Monero has, for the reasons you mentioned.  But I would also make you aware of the View Key in Monero, which gives full auditing into all deposits for a given XMR address.  It has _optional transparency_ or opt-out privacy.  Not transparent by default like bitcoin.

This is true. In second place we have a crypto that was basically an ICO, is reliant on a founder (as well as a foundation), and has had multiple security issues (rollbacks, wallet bugs), congestion, and high transaction fees.  
It seems to be smooth sailing ahead for Bitcoin unless something like Monero comes from behind out of nowhere.  It definitely won't be whatever r/cryptocurrency is currently shilling en masse.

It's not one or the other.   If you've been paying attention to the dark web over the years, XMR adoption is becoming the standard.  As a BTC supporter, I am perfectly fine with this because its transparency isn't well suited to conducting grey/black market commerce.  Perhaps this will change but I don't see bitcoin changing its properties to suit these use cases.

It will happen over time as the reward decreases. The incentive to process larger blocks will grow when the fees are a large enough percentage of the overall block reward, and as bandwidth capacity improves. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:22:34
I would caution you about the [moral hazard]( associated with a seemingly simple "2mb hardfork".  The reason bitcoin hasn't forked [since mid-2013]( is because there hasn't been an engineering reason good enough to do so. Segwit's brilliance was raising the block size in a backwards compatible way.  Since the concept of Segwit, a standalone hard fork for a capacity increase became an inelegant method for performing an upgrade.    If we are to raise the block size, and it must be done in a hard fork, then it must be much more future proofed than a one time increase and have a greater aim to enhance bitcoin's protocol than simply addressing capacity.  
@_date: 2018-05-11 02:27:34
Monero because of default privacy, ring signatures, stealth addresses, adjustable block size, and focus on asic-free mining.  Monero is the only truly fungible cryptocurrency.  If bitcoin is gold, monero is cash.
Litecoin because of its symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin. It helped proved the validity of segwit and acts as a cheap transaction layer during times of congestion on BTC.  It is like the silver to bitcoin's gold.  
Like Bitcoin, both of these projects were fairly launched (no pre-mine, ICO), bring unique features to the table, have competent security minded developers, and have several years track record of increasing user growth and liquidity.  There's really no other projects you can say that about.
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:47:00
Coins such as Monero fill an important gap that bitcoin is not serving with regard to fungibility.  Other coins like Litecoin fill an important role to help alleviate spam attacks which push the average tx fee higher.  These coins also benefit BTC from a technical standpoint.  LTC served as a good testbed for new features such as Segwit, and we may see other enhancements such as bulletproofs 
 (being developed by monero) adopted in BTC as well.  Ethereum's solidity smart contract language will be used in Rootstock's implementation using the bitcoin network.  
All of these projects can be a benefit to bitcoin even though some may view them as direct competitors.  I don't think any of them hold a candle to the digital store of value use case, which is why most of us are here.

It is impossible for a home user to host and run a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain.  Let that sink in. The  crypto requires an enterprise grade system and bandwidth to properly run a full node.  If bcash were to run at full capacity, it would be much worse. As this continues you can imagine what happens down the road.  Pretty soon only the larger datacenters can run nodes.  And then what would it take for the top 2-3 world powers to compel these businesses to censor transactions or blacklist addresses?  Not a whole lot.

I'm not sure what the current specs are. The one site I knew that was tracking the overall size of the ETH blockchain stopped hosting it after it reached beyond 1 terabyte.  But for most people the issues would be around [I/O and bandwidth requirements](  You would need a dedicated box and an uncapped internet at a minimum, which is why I say it goes beyond most "home" users.  
Regular people can still run bitcoin on their desktop PC and not really notice it.  That's pretty remarkable considering the number of users and how much commerce is supported by the BTC network.

Let's be honest, companies like Visa, Paypal, and Amex are making tons of profit and have no reason to get behind it.  Bitcoin is creating its own economy and will do just fine as it blazes its own path to ubiquity.  Where we will see the most growth are companies looking to gain an edge in their industry.  Companies like Ally bank or Nationwide insurance who have tons of competitors and need every bit of publicity they can get.

I think if I'm Draper and I want to win this, I'd stay quiet until after the auction so the competition thinks they can get the coins for at-or-below market price.  But I love his enthusiasm.  I think he doesn't even care much about the buy-in price and will bid whatever he thinks it will take to own them.  
Anyone wondering why he doesn't just use coinbase/bitstamp/etc should put themselves in his shoes.  He's a billionaire who would probably rather have a lot of 50,000 coins at a basis price of 500-600-700 or whatever it is to make the accounting simpler.  Sure, he could play around with the minuscule liquidity on bitstamp for several months and scoop up the cheaper coins, but the accounting is now much more messy with the variable buy-in price along with other logistical challenges with properly transferring and storing those coins from the various exchanges.

That's because everything mentioning bitcoin *is* good news unless it contains some fatal flaw in the protocol.  
Every news article, good or bad, raises awareness of bitcoin.  There are many people who became aware of bitcoin, not by the positive news headlines, but by the negative headlines and thought "What's the deal with this bitcoin thing".  They subsequently did the research and are now invested and believers in the technology.  
Unless we see a fatal flaw, we will only continue to see more adoption.  The price is only a short term indicator of market sentiment.  What really matters is the adoption rate, and every news article, whether it is China banning bitcoin, the US Government selling bitcoin, or an NBA team accepting bitcoin, all have the effect of drawing more people into this ecosystem.

Sure, decentralization brings some interesting complexity to the ability to push new code, but at the same time if there is a code update that is critical to the success of the network, it can get pushed out pretty easily with no resistance.  I agree with the fact that a dropped call isn't the same when we're dealing with money, but the transaction limit issue does not present problems with loss or theft of people's bitcoins.  It only means the network may get busy and transactions would not confirm for a longer period of time.  I am not aware of any issues with bitcoin that would result in people outright losing money or having their funds stolen.

And since we know that several individuals own greater than 1,000 coins, that tens of thousands of coins have been lost, and potentially 1 million coins owned by Satoshi will never move, the actual amount that 1 million people could realistically own has to be much less than 21.

One of the great things about Bitcoin is that it's an uncorrelated asset. It's not really tied to any particular sector of an economy like traditional assets.

@_date: 2015-01-02 03:23:47
No, because that sustained buying from the base of users is just what keeps the price up to something  assured to be at or above $50.  There is much more development going on, not just the "smoke and mirrors" as you call them.  These include merchant adoption, product launches, increasing publicity, and other intangible developments like the BitLicense along with regulatory clarity worldwide.  The latter of those items doesn't necessarily have a direct impact on price, only the first does, which is what this entire argument is based on.

What altcoin has more unique individual stakeholders than Bitcoin? To me that is what matters.

Right. It wouldn't even need to be on chain. Just on a service that is relatively trustworthy and could be topped off every so often.  Something like a "Newsbrowser" that could allow seamless integration with the big news outlets (WSJ, NYT, etc) and sends them a penny or two for each article consumed.  None of this needs to be on the blockchain. I know we hate trusted third parties here, but the risk is a few dollars to prevent millions of microtransactions from clogging up the blockchain.

Which is why a block size increase will not make fees disappear like some have alluded to. People never minded a small fee. We don't know what will happen as block competition gets higher, though. Fees *will* rise, that's for sure, but the utility of Bitcoin will likely go down. 
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:12:59
The use case for Bitcoin as a much better store of value than gold can easily be satisfied with 1 mb blocks. I would say the valuation for just that use alone would warrant a price of several thousand per BTC.

Of course it's about scaling. What other parameters does BU explicitly give miners control over besides the block size? 
Segwit, in their eyes, is too little too late.  BU is a way to take the block size parameter away from core developers because, in their eyes, a 1 mb block size will inhibit growth too much even with segwit and layer-2 options.

Why these things?  Why not attack by building up mining hardware and try to fork the network themselves.  Or better yet, covertly buy up as many bitcoins as possible to crash the price during every rise.  Using the block size debate just seems like a really ineffective "long con" that has little success of actually doing any harm.
I mean, since the blocks were spammed and were consistently full, and this debate has raged to fever pitch levels, we've seen, what, a 50% price *increase*?  Doesn't sound like an effective strategy to kill bitcoin.

Altclient sounds like it's just an alternative to Core, but still has the same consensus rules. Why don't we just call it what it is? It's a fork.  It attempts to add a feature that is not included in the current design.  There's nothing crazy or contentious about it, and frankly, Bitcoin would not have gotten off the ground if early adopters were afraid of embracing code changes.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:21:06
A compromise would be Segwit and a planned block size increase HF. Whether it's a straight 2-4 MB increase, 2-4-8, or auto-scaling (15% per year or whatever).  The compromise is doing *something* about the 1 MB block size (with or without segwit) rather than letting this fever pitch continue.

It's a change to 2 MB. Who really cares who proposed it? It's Bitcoin core with 2 MB. It could be co-authored by Mark Karpeles and Josh Garza as well and it wouldn't make a difference. All of this character assassination is useless and is no different than people who criticize Bitcoin because the it was invented by an anonymous person. Satoshi could be a child rapist and it should have no bearing on whether Bitcoin is a good idea or not.

The *equivalent* of 2-4 MB, which is still not the same thing as an actual increase since there will need to be quite a bit of re-engineering before the majority of transactions will utilize it.  SegWit and a 2 MB increase are not mutually exclusive. With 2MB blocks + SegWit, we could see an equivalent to 4-8 MB blocks.  There needs to always be some head room considering that blocks can sometimes take an hour or more to be solved.

I don't think the definition of non-contentious can be 100% of the nodes and miners on the network. That's not really possible in any kind of distributed system like bitcoin.  Non contentious should mean that a large majority firmly stands behind a decision, and there is not a significant contingent of people who are adamantly against the fork.  It's not an exact science.

The criticism of opt-in RBF is that it's not optional for the merchants and payment processors to require a code change.  They have to upgrade in order to not get burned by double spends.  The other issue is that RBF compliments small blocks due to the inevitable increasing transaction fees. It allows people to pull a transaction back because the normal fee was not enough. Most people would rather see a larger block so that fees can remain relatively flat and predictable.  It's only when you have high competition for block space that you see the need for RBF on a day-to-day basis.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:28:20

But I'm glad you've realized that efficient block transmission can potentially remove size mediated orphaning from the mining game. I expect that you will now be compelled by intellectual honesty to go do internet battle with **all the people claiming that a fee market will necessarily exist absent a blocksize limit** due to this factor. Right?
--Greg Maxwell
Up until a year ago transactions could be sent with zero or very little fee and still be reliably confirmed within a few blocks, however we still saw the vast majority of transactions including a fee of 10,000 satoshis or more.  There was no incentive to do this other than to guarantee inclusion into the next available block due to miner preferences rather than the block size.  People have and will always be willing to pay a fee to use the bitcoin blockchain, but as that cost increases the usefulness and applications become more limited.

The grading companies are not perfect by any means, but it seems they try to compare the coins based on the average condition of its peers, which in the case of the brass Casascius coins, they are all pretty rough looking.  They usually assign the brass coins anywhere from MS-60 to MS-68, and ANACS in the last few years began giving higher grades to the brass tokens due to the "curve" so to speak.  ICG now grades crypto coins too and does a seemingly better job at assessing the quality.  They also would presumably need to look at the hologram placement and condition.  Many of these early coins were handled quite a bit, so it doesn't take much to notice the few that stand out.

In 1971 the US officially abandoned the gold standard which meant that money could be printed endlessly, without anything backing it up.
This meant that anyone who had worked their entire lives and saved in US treasury notes were holding the bag, as their savings evaporated by the silent tax known as inflation.  
What inflation and endless money printing does is remove the incentive to save money, and instead promotes taking on large amounts of debt.  This causes the large boom and bust cycles we have seen since the 70's.  Also, because spending money has no consequences, it also allows our government to wage war without the consent of the population (remember war bonds?).  
It is now 2018 and collectively the world is roughly 200 trillion dollars in global debt.  The free money has saddled an entire generation with student loan debt, as well as massive increases in costs for healthcare, housing, and everything else across the board.  Eventually servicing this debt is going to eat away at a disproportionate amount of the economy, until it folds and we start over.

How does all of this debate with regard to the block size allow them to control it more?

It seems to me that because of this intense debate we are seeing more diverse activity on the bitcoin dev mailing list and the github than ever before.  At the very least there is a much higher level of awareness about the goings on at the core development level than ever before.

I trade it in a similar way also. I agree that it is insane to be holding at a 70% premium, especially considering that 10 shares of GBTC only equals ~0.94 bitcoin now as management fees have eaten away at it.  But I think the tax benefits of an IRA cannot be overstated as well as the technical hurdles to get into bitcoin.

This is an extremely important point. The network is already approaching the maximum amount of I/O, CPU, bandwidth that most home users would have just enough capacity to run a full node.  Especially in an era of data caps at 1tb per month being common in many places.

Good luck creating one that would pass the trained eye.  The people who buy these know exactly what they are looking for, and the pool of people selling them is very small.

@_date: 2019-03-21 13:18:58
This is entirely correct.  At best a person can use their money to allow 2-3 people already working in the bitcoin codebase the financial freedom to do it full time, and to take on bigger initiatives that are beneficial to the core dev roadmap.  But to say that we can just double the number or 10x the number of core developers is totally impractical, and at best will only lead to technical debt and wasted efforts.  Engineering a protocol is very difficult, and getting it right is much more important than "run fast and break things" when talking about a financial network storing tens of billions in value.

There was, but the cost to borrowing money was much higher because the consequences for not paying would be severe, since every dollar theoretically represented some amount of gold.

Because it means bitcoin can resist changes to some of its more durable properties.  There was tremendous pressure for bitcoin to change despite wide disagreement among engineers, and bitcoin succeeded in resisting this change to its inherent properties.  This means that if some of the other properties of bitcoin were to be tested, such as the total inflation rate (currently not contentious), censorship of transactions, or any number of things, it could also successfully thwart these attempts to change fundamental properties of bitcoin.  
The times when bitcoin _should_ change are when there is wide support among engineers, users, and miners alike. We see this with several bug fixes and even the ultimate passage of Segwit, which was unfortunately politicized however was generally accepted as a good engineering solution to raising the block size and addressing a variety of other challenges in a backwards compatible fashion.

I'm going to go on a limb and say that he predicts the ETF approval will be a bullish event that could cause panic in the markets between the announcement and day 1 of trading of COIN.  If that's the case, GBTC is a good buy because it will be treated like a "pre-IPO" of COIN. Even if the premium for GBTC goes down, the price rise in BTC would offset that making it a good buy for non-liquid assets in an IRA/401K.

Face to face is increasingly becoming the way to do it. A plane flight is a small percentage of the cost.  Or you can use a trusted escrow on the Bitcointalk forum.  Paypal is the least preferred option for obvious reasons.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:57:48
In this case the escrow agent would need to analyze the dispute and make a judgement. That's what they are getting paid for with the 1% fee.  
The escrow would take into account many factors such as the history of the buyer/seller, how many successful transactions they have performed, the quality of the sales listing (for instance did they take pictures with their username and date proving ownership).  
That's why it's a good idea to use Registered mail with proper insurance (there's a $50k limit).  With registered mail the Post Office is required to keep it under lock and key and a signature from the PO worker who takes custody each step of the way.  So if shipped this way, it only comes down to the trustworthiness of the parties involved and the supplied evidence. Usually it's easy to tell who is lying and who isn't.  
You're right, though, there's never 100% guarantee an item will arrive in tact.  But I think everyone would agree that they would rather use this method than let Paypal handle the dispute, who nearly always rules against the seller.

If the key can be determined... then it's like someone who somehow gains access to your regular checking/savings account. If they move the funds, they've committed a crime, because they've stolen your property.  
The same is true if they move the bitcoins into their personal wallet. Whether they stumbled on the private key by installing a keylogger, or by brute force, is not really relevant is it?  Now, of course, the chances of them getting caught and whether they can even identify you to return the funds if they wanted to, that's a different story.

Could this be related to Asicboost?  If this is a transaction that they created, theoretically it could be used to avoid the empty blocks commonly associated with Asicboost while also giving the appearance that they are gathering up regular TX's.  If someone looked purely at the fact that they found a block and included 1 MB worth of TX's, it doesn't look nearly as suspicious as an empty block. But since the TX's are known ahead of time, they could use the Asicboost cheat without raising any red flags.

It would be interesting to see that listing.  As far as fees go, if GBTC is charging 2% per yr to hold just BTC, we can expect these to be closer to that (maybe 1-2%).  I'm sure there are compliance headaches along with the need for additional security controls to make it worthwhile.

There are members of the forum who are known for trading higher valued collectibles and providing escrow services for a small fee.  
The way it works is as follows:
1. Seller sells a coin to buyer. Buyer gets to choose whether they want to use escrow, and they will agree on a trusted escrow (there are quite a few who have handled 100's of BTC for multiple years, [for example](
2. Buyer sends the BTC to the escrow, and the escrow notifies the seller that he has received the funds.
3. Seller ships the item and provides tracking info to escrow and buyer.
4. Once buyer receives and item and inspects it, he notifies the escrow to release the funds to the seller.
This works out 99% of the time.  For funded coins, it is up to the buyer to inspect the item to ensure it is legitimate and funded on the blockchain.

That said, when charlatans go around spreading the "Satoshi's Vision"  crap, they allude to satoshi being some mythical god figure that could do no wrong. When in reality bitcoin is just a stack of technologies that were put together in such a way to solve a specific problem.

It's not that they implemented BIP70, it's the way they did it.  To not allow an alternative? That is pretty fucked up, and goes against the spirit of backwards compatibility and supporting a variety of implementations.  A lot of their merchants lost sales as a result, because at the time pretty much everyone using a trezor, ledger, or mobile wallet was unable to pay using a Bitpay merchant. 
The other thing that Bitpay did was to support a centralized coup of the bitcoin protocol through S2X, and continue to support it in the face of wide community disagreement up until the final days.
And one more thing: The way they have implemented bcash, to promote it as a zero fee alternative to bitcoin, and force users to pay exorbitant BTC network fees, is downright shameful.  Again, if they allowed people to pay in BCH, that's fine, but given everything that has happened, Bitpay's promotion of bcash is a spit in the face to bitcoiners.
So yes, fuck them.  Bitcoiners should refuse to use any merchant that makes them use Bitpay.

I don't see it killing off legitimate transactions, it will just be yet another burdensome regulation that will make the IRS's job more difficult. In a Bitcoin economy, volatility will go down over time which makes these taxable events less profitable for the IRS to investigate. 
If someone converts their salary to Bitcoin and makes dozens of purchases a month, are they really going to audit them and recover the whopping $23 in tax revenue they missed out on? Go ahead.  Keeping track of it all is a lot harder than paying whatever fee they'll charge on the chance someone is audited. 
Now, in the case where Bitcoin goes up 100% or more in a given year, and a person has made a larger purchase like a house, car, or anything over $10k. Then yes, that might be worth it for IRS to care about, as well as the person filing their taxes.

That seems like a fair critique of the project overall, and you are correct to not condemn it outright  before it has a chance to succeed.  LN may not be the layer-2 protocol that ultimately allows bitcoin to scale, but it is a step in the right direction.  In the meantime there are ways to further compress signatures on the main blockchain, and as more of these efficiencies are realized, support will grow for a long term scaling solution which includes a base block size increase.  The path the dev community has chosen may not be the path of fastest growth or favoring lower value use cases, but it is one that prioritizes security and stability.

Bitcoin will eventually have nearly-free and instant transactions on secondary layers such as Lightning network and sidechains.  There are already working implementations of this tech, and we will see much progress on them in 2018.  Until then, it might cost $0.50 - $1.00 to send a transaction if you're not in a hurry. During times when the network is under attack, it may go up to $2 or $3.  
There is no cryptocurrency that has scaling figured out completely.  
The fact that Bitcoin's competitors can send transactions cheaply is a side effect of the lack of usage.  Bitcoin had this same capability until 2016 or so.  There is no blockchain that can exponentially grow at the base layer without running into  very real engineering challenges.

Anything promoted by Max Keiser.  Blockchain.info was the wallet of choice for everyone in 2013 and now people are ridiculed for having coins there.  
Bruce seems to have very well reasoned posts here, and coming from an investment background there's no doubt he is keen to look into all projects that may turn into a viable company one day. What difference does it make if he occasionally gets it wrong? How many people bought into Paycoin because of Bruce's comments, when every other post on here was about how much of a scam it was, many of which *was* just pitchfork talk.
Either way, Factom doesn't need his endorsement to succeed, there are plenty of heavyweights backing that project and the team's mission.  What this place doesn't need however is people like you attacking anyone who has reached any level of noteworthiness in this space by pointing out every misstep they may have made along the way.

If a government wants to destroy bitcoin and achieves 40% of the network, there are many scenarios in which they can do harm, most of which do not involve needing to take advantage of a hard fork.  You are giving a hypothetical example that makes me think we need to get this fork in sooner rather than later, because we may never reach consensus that satisfies everybody.  
Maybe 8mb isn't the right fork, but I don't see the other devs pushing a compromise solution.  How about something simple like 4mb now and a 15% yearly increase? Fine. People will support that.  What people won't support is 1MB and that's why we're seeing a mass exodus to XT.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:22:30
Easier for the exchanges and wallets, but not the full nodes who have to store all of these transactions until the end of time.  A block increase delays any incentive for wallets and exchanges to incorporate things like Segwit, payment channels, or smart fee estimation. Exchanges will continue to push that waste onto the network until it can no longer bear it. It makes much more sense to go through these growing pains now.  
At this point, a simple hard fork to change block size will be contentious enough to create a chain split. It has to be part of a long term plan that addresses many engineering goals besides just the block size.  
Scheduling one now doesn’t make much sense until it’s determined how the layer-2 features develop over the next 1-2 years. It’s impossible to know what additional changes may be needed or how large blocks should be to sustain further growth.

There are tons of choices. That's part of the problem. You give 10 developers the same challenge and they come up with 10 solutions.  They will nitpick the hell out of all 9 of the other suggestions until nothing happens. Then, a "design by committee" solution is released that supposedly accommodates everybody.  But it has the effect of confusing people about the actual *intent* of the change to begin with.  This isn't rocket science. Raise the blocks and lets move on.

This is the most important thing anyone can do for bitcoin.  Encourage efficient use of the blockchain!  They need to implement both Segwit and intelligent fee calculation.  Why don't exchanges let users choose between high/low priority withdrawals?  The other day I was forced to pay 0.002 to withdraw a small amount of BTC from Cryptopia.  It's extremely wasteful and I won't do business with them until it's resolved.

Currently they accept uncontroversial and non-consensus breaking enhancements and bug fixes.  Choosing to do a hard fork is not something that a couple of devs gets to decide. Commit rights has nothing to do with it. You would need near unanimous agreement among most of the devs, community members, exchanges, miners, and other stakeholders.  It's not impossible, but the threshold is very high to do a hard fork.

It's funny how people come to similar conclusions. I've researched more coins than I'd like to admit, and I agree, at this point I believe it comes down to Bitcoin or Monero.
 Privacy by default is a killer feature. On top of that, auto-adjusting block sizes. Fairly launched, fairly mined. Brilliant dev team.

Mob mentality means nothing. You vote with your hash power and that will be that.  A fork to XT does not all of a sudden give ultimate power over to Gavin and Mike.  They can easily fork back to core once it gets with the program on larger blocks.  Core will be backwards compatible if XT wins out.

It could certainly be more decentralized. Unfortunately the skill set of a core developer is extremely difficult to attain.  We're talking about combining the fields of protocol development, peer to peer networking, distributed consensus, and cryptography.  They also have to understand the history of engineering challenges that bitcoin has faced, and how any new change might contain trade-offs from an engineering or security perspective.  
We are lucky to have a couple dozen people with 5+ years of hands on bitcoin protocol development under their belt and who are still active in the code base.  This number will grow as more intermediate developers learn the finer points of the protocol, and gain the respect of those who came before them.  There has never been a better time for an aspiring developer to help out with the many layer-2 projects (LN, Rootstock, Drivechains) and protocol enhancements (MAST, CT, Schnorr) that Segwit has opened the door for.

Satoshi originally put in a 500-700 kb limit prior to implementing the 1mb hard cap.  He knew very well the dangers of allowing nodes to become inundated with transactions.

I think you have a pretty basic understanding of how most PoS coins work. Take a coin like Blackcoin, for instance, which has a 1% stake reward annually. That means if you own 1,000 Blackcoin and hold it in a wallet, over the course of a year your stake rewards would slowly add up to about 10 new coins. If you owned 100,000, you would get about 1,000. If these people pooled their coins together, they would collectively get 1,010. Why would they give up all ownership of their coins to a central authority to do that? It takes nothing for them to run the QT wallet on a desktop computer, plus they get the satisfaction of securing the network.

Actually I just checked the default fee in Bread Wallet (my main spending wallet) and the default fee is 19 bits. By my calculation, 1900 Satoshi is currently worth less than half a penny. Since when does it cost several pennies today unless someone just wants to throw money away? In fact odds are you can get a transaction to go through with no fee at all. But that said, I'm in favor of the increase, so all of your "people like you" smug talk and calling me a liar just makes me have no desire to talk to you.

I think BitTorrent is a good parallel, but it's seems better actually. Maybe it's because it was invented years after torrents.

I agree the blind faith is sometimes a little disappointing here, and the opposition to any criticisms of bitcoin. There are many things about bitcoin that are not perfect, no doubt.  But the bitcoin subreddit is also the place where optimism should be expected. The reddit hive mind is not limited to this subreddit.  There are many varying opinions here as well, which is why the block size debate is taking the shape that it is.  It will be resolved when the time is right. Nobody denies the block size needs to increase, it's just a matter of how and when.  
Lastly, this is all still an experiment. The fact we have a real possibility of an exit from central banking and government fiat is almost too good to be true.  There is still tons of work to be done, but the genie is out of the bottle and it's not going back in.

Or they can do their research and take advantage of a lower price during the uncertainty. Bitcoin will be fine either way. It will do well as a settlement network and a safe haven for wealth, even if fees are $1-$5 per transaction. Keep in mind, we are very far away from that. When they are a nickel or more the devs will likely crumble under intense pressure and outrage. When they reach 10 cents and, God forbid, 25 cents, a fever pitch will develop. The devs holding out will literally need to go into hiding or concede their position. 
But as a hedge against inflation and a portable, more practical form of gold, Bitcoin will do well even if fees were $25 or $100. Seriously, it's not going anywhere. It just would be utterly useless for micropayments and poor people. But for settling multinational petroleum transactions, Inter-bank wire transfers, and large purchases and estate settlements, it will have immense potential.

There are likely dozens of people sitting on 10,000 or more coins, and several hundred people sitting on 1,000 or more.  This reduces the overall pie to a much smaller amount than 21 million.  You mentioned the lost Bitcoins as well.  
We can see from the data above that over 90% of all coins in existence belong to addresses containing 10 coins or more.  Granted some of those would be exchange addresses who presumably hold coins for multiple individuals, so there really isn't a definitive way to know.  We do know one thing, however, and it's that it will be much much less than 21 million people who could ever hope to own 1 whole coin.

From a game theory perspective, a 75% consensus on XT means that Core is a rapidly sinking ship (if core even is different at that point). Miners on the old fork are essentially throwing money away once it takes effect. Any coins mined under the old code are meaningless since they won't be spendable via Bitpay, Coinbase or recognized by any of the common wallets like bread, mycelium, electrum, etc. It would not be felt in the slightest by anyone outside of some ill prepared or misguided mining operations, and it would be very temporarily as they are not in the business to lose money.

I'm not usually one to promote PoS, but I've never seen people pooling their PoS coins together with any kind of central authority to increase their chances at stake rewards. Show me where that type of service even exists. They can send them to an exchange, yes, but no exchange is paying stake rewards for PoS coins. So there is a disincentive to keep them anywhere but your local wallet to generate more coins. 
There are many points that can be made in the PoW/PoS debate, but centralization to increase stake weight is not one of them.

I believe you referred to me as a "big fat liar, spreading false information, and ignoramus".  If you think that's acceptable dialogue then I feel sorry for you.  Regarding the transaction fees, I've never had a problem getting a TX included in a block when using a 19 bit fee, and I make at least a few per week.  Looking at the Bitcoin XT wallet, the default fee is even less, it's 1001 satoshi or roughly one quarter of a penny.  When you say there's a "standard miners fee that everybody else uses" that's just not true. 
Yes we need a block increase and I agree with Gavin's proposal, but the days of us seeing a required fee of more than a few pennies are still pretty far away (likely 1 year or more).  If you disagree with that, then you are just adding fuel to the fire and it's no wonder people are fed up with this debate.

Yes but take a company like Snapchat, a free messaging app, and ask what its maximum potential is. They have 100m users, great. They allow people to chat privately. How many people would pay for this service? How long until Apple/Google build these features into the native phone messaging app to get some people back? 
I don't quite understand how Snapchat can extract 18 billion dollars out of their customers without charging a monthly premium or selling their data to advertisers. The barrier to making a secure messaging app is low and competitors like Telegram are doing quite well, making a monthly free for Snapchat result in a mass exodus. Likewise, selling customer data or filling them with ads isn't in the spirit of a privacy focused application. But if they make it, great, it could be a 20B dollar company. Could it be 40B, 100B, or 500B dollar company? 
Compare that to something like Bitcoin, a global decentralized currency, backed by an immutable ledger. What's the maximum potential for Bitcoin? It's not an app but many apps for it exist. It's not a company but many companies exist because of it. There isn't a revenue model, it is the revenue. Its competitors are the U.S. Dollar, the yen, the euro. These currencies are flooding in to create more companies to build more infrastructure for Bitcoin at a rate greater than any other technology. It makes possible a vast economy for goods and services, some illicit, some legitimate. It also has a token to fuel these transactions, of which only 21 million will ever exist. Collectively these tokens are worth 1/4th of Snapchat.

There is no incentive to do so because it wouldn't increase your reward. PoS rewards are typically distributed at a set %, so you gain new coins whether your balance is large or small.  There is also a huge problem in that you would be trusting someone with your entire stash. Compared to a mining pool where you're temporarily pointing hashpower to it.  I can't even imagine anyone wanting to work on such a project. I'm not a developer, but I believe the way stake weight is calculated would make this a difficult system to implement.  
But who knows? Satoshi never really predicted the emergence of mining pools and I have no idea what could be built in the future.  I like Bitcoin and don't worry too much about PoS coins, even though I think they are fun and enjoy getting stake rewards. It's the only way I'll ever get to "mine" for coins.  I think enough people will see the same value in coins like Peercoin to at least make it the Pluto orbiting around the Sun that is Bitcoin, and that would be enough for me.

The thought is, if you spend bitcoin and immediately re-buy, it would offset the merchant selling your bitcoin for fiat.  Some merchants keep a % of sales in bitcoin and convert the rest. Some may keep 100% in bitcoin. By replacing what you spend it's a net-neutral impact to bitcoin, but most likely a net-positive. It also helps the ecosystem overall by furthering bitcoin's value as a payment mechanism rather than as just a store of value.

It's not  'thats it', Segwit is only the first step.

Bitcoin is security software at its heart. Could you imagine your bank never updating their antivirus software?  Bitcoin is securing $20B of wealth and fortunately until now has been pretty resilient against attacks. The way it did that is because the software improved quite a bit from 2009-2012.  We don't know whether its current security will protect against future attacks, and so it needs the ability to improve. Segwit offers security improvements as well as on-chain scaling that pretty much everyone agrees is needed.  UASF allows bitcoin to upgrade when near-unanimous support exists, especially when a small minority of powerful actors are incentivized to prevent the upgrade at the expense of the rest of the network.

While it has not been for a long period of time, it's now more valuable than the combined market cap of Ripple and Litecoin, and consistently doing about a quarter of the transaction volume of Bitcoin. That's pretty significant. 
I'm not sure how the devs announcing that they are dumping their coins coincides with a dramatic price increase. That seems counter intuitive. But if you are convinced the devs are going to dump coins or that the economics of POS will kill the coin, then clearly you must be shorting it, right? There are at least a few avenues for short selling ETH if you are confident in its demise. 
I know that bitcoiners like to shit on every coin that isn't Bitcoin but at what point will people start to wake up that there are alternatives out there gaining market share and siphoning users away from this community.

LTC isn't a technological leap over bitcoin, but it is very complimentary to BTC.  The project's ethics seem to be aligned with BTC, and it offers a nice low-fee alternative during times of congestion for BTC, along with a testbed for new features (Atomic Swaps, etc).

Hey, I can appreciate you coming on here to defend Coinbase.  I've been a member since January 2013 (5 years last month), and have witnessed the growth first hand.  It has been amazing.
This past year, however, Coinbase let me down in several ways.  For one, the NYA was a total fucking disaster and Coinbase was a large part of this by issuing conflicting press releases that made it seem like a mining coup might actually result in renaming the 2x fork Bitcoin, and calling the real bitcoin something else.  There is no way that a group of CEOs can get together to force protocol decisions. That's just naive and I hope there were several retrospectives outlining this internally to Coinbase higher ups after it failed miserably.  
On top of that, Coinbase was attempting to force protocol decisions without contributing any development to the protocol whatsoever.  That has changed in recent months, and as the largest and most successful company using Bitcoin, I'm glad Coinbase sees how it owes to the community meaningful contributions through the open source development process (and NOT through proclamations by the CEO or backroom deals to undercut the core maintainers).  It was outrageous when it was revealed after vehemently pushing for a larger block that Coinbase itself was ill prepared to leverage the benefits of Segwit.  Again, this has changed in recent weeks and it is a great thing that Coinbase is rolling out Segwit along with batching of transactions.  
I won't even get into the Bitcoin Cash launch which still makes my blood boil.  The way that Bitcoin Cash has tarnished the brand of Bitcoin over the last 6 months is disgusting, and I can't wait for the day it is delisted from your platform due to dwindling trade volume.  It has no purpose to exist other than to further Bitmain and Roger Ver's interests, and Coinbase played into their hands like a fucking pawn.  
At this point, Bitcoiners will tolerate Coinbase until something better comes along.  The only way it can gain the trust back fully is by rededicating itself to Bitcoin (BTC), supporting smart scaling enhancements (not quick fixes with security trade-offs), and helping to build the next layer of functionality that will make Bitcoin the ubiquitous value transfer protocol that it was meant to be.

There is nothing interesting about allowing more liberal forms of contracts.  Bitcoin had much more flexibility early on in terms of scripting abilities, but these were removed to increase security at the base layer.  Many projects came around which had more complex smart projects prior to ethereum doing it (NXT, Bitshares, etc).  
The only difference is that none of these projects had the marketing budget and mouth piece that Ethereum fanboys have.  The idea of smart contracts existed both in idea and functionality long before ETH came around.  


Bitcoin has had the ability for anyone to issue an ICO for years.  Token offerings were done on the bitcoin network using colored coins for Factom, Maidsafe, Safex, and many others.  These colored coins work very, very similar to ERC20 tokens but use the Mastercoin/Counterparty protocol instead.  In addition to BTC, we had NXT which has issued hundreds of ERC20-like tokens on its network.  All of these capabilities existed long before the Ethereum network was launched.

You are talking about a [chain reorganization]( which is a naturally occurring aspect of all blockchains.  A rollback is changing the consensus rules of the network to reverse or undo transactions, and is a manual process creating a huge disruption to the network.  Not only does this change need to be coded into a new software release, all participants must also upgrade (including exchanges and enterprise users).  Any transactions which occurred in the meantime may leave users or exchanges open to double spend attacks unless the entire network is shut down after the issue arose.  A rollback should only be considered in a worst case scenario for any blockchain.

Segwit is a new type of address in bitcoin that can be distinguished because it starts with a "3" or a "bc1" as opposed to the standard leading "1".  These address types use different signature types, so they end up using less space and cost less per byte to transact with on the bitcoin network. If everyone used Segwit, the max block size would be equivalent of nearly 2 MB as opposed to 1.
Basically, wallets that give you an address beginning with 3 are the good ones (or bc1 for the lesser common but even more efficient bech32 format).

Those are mostly copiers and other office printers. You are correct to be cautious of using any networked (connected to internet over WiFi) or business related printers, especially copy machines (those over $300 starting out).
But for most home printers, even mid to high grade home printers, this is less of an issue. Not only will they not pay the added expense of a hard drive to cache documents, but what purpose or feature would it have that a home user needs? It’s also fairly easy to physically inspect a small home printer’s internal components. A bigger concern is preventing your printer from accessing WiFi along with physical security for your paper wallets.

Sure it is. They may not be huge players, but BitPay, Coinbase, Circle, 21 all have an obligation and responsibility to inform people about bitcoin.  It is why the Bitcoin Bowl was named that instead of being called the BitPay Bowl.  Everyone gave credit to them as if it was a selfless move, but it was also the right business move. Until Bitcoin grows into the mainstream, all of these companies will need to work together to create a more positive image for this technology.

I see Shapeshift as more of a transaction facilitator.  They do tons of volume, but that volume consists of behind the scenes trades on several altcoin exchanges like Bittrex, Poloniex, Bitfinex, etc.  I also imagine many of their transactions do not involve bitcoin, and uses altcoin to altcoin instead.  That said, when Shapeshift is accepting a bitcoin, they are doing so with the need to exchange that bitcoin on those exchanges for the altcoin that they've paid out.  If the exchange doesn't accept their BTC as being the real BTC, they have no way of replenishing their supply of altcoins.  Shapeshift doesn't get to determine what the real bitcoin is, the altcoin exchanges do.  
Xapo, on the other hand, is a large custodian and platform holding significant amounts of bitcoins in cold storage.  They are important because their role is that of gatekeeper between customers and their coins, similar to Bitgo and Coinbase.  Their decision to support a fork of bitcoin is the only recourse for users whose coins are secured by their platform.
Bitpay is also important because they are the most common way people can purchase products directly from a merchant using bitcoin.  It processes bitcoin payments for thousands (if not tens of thousands) of merchants and those merchants are at the mercy of Bitpay for determining what type of bitcoin is "valid". Bitpay also supports the Copay and Bitcore software projects that provide the back end architecture for several bitcoin wallets/companies.

It's still a very important point: Of all the cryptos to be released in the 10 years since bitcoin was invented, there isn't one that presents a significant challenge in terms of long term staying power. 
 If there was one that I would say could eventually compete with Bitcoin, it would be Monero.  The reason is because it's the only other crypto with a tremendous amount of volunteer (or community funded) engineering support / technical development, growing transactional demand, and robust decentralization of nodes / mining, which I think are all "lightning in a bottle" type of achievements and can't be easily replicated.

LTC has proven its worth though.  The ability for Litecoin to incorporate segwit prior to bitcoin was a turning point in the debate.  It's also nice to have a backup for when the BTC network is under tremendous transaction demand.  LTC pairs nicely because it's quicker and cheaper to send but doesn't have the scammy aftertaste of bcash.  Plus, people actually want Litecoin.

Erik, I have been in bitcoin for 5 years now, and you are one of the biggest reasons why. It was an interview you gave in 2013 describing the decentralized nature of the blockchain that sealed the deal on how revolutionary the technology was.
Unfortunately, seeing your pro-2x posts over the past few weeks has led me to believe that you are on the wrong side of what the community wants.   I'm not sure if it's stubbornness or clouded judgement that is causing you to promote this contentious protocol change, but it's very disappointing nonetheless.  As a former big blocker myself, it took quite a lot of reading and debating to finally understand that bitcoin must scale on a second layer to preserve decentralization.  I wish you would either take a step back or reconsider your decision.  It's not too late to reverse course.

The use case described by doesn't require thousands of transactions per second.  Of all the world's transactions, how many involve ~~selling stocks~~ moving stocks between brokerage accounts or wiring several thousand dollars? Bitcoin is perfect for that use case, even today, because attaching an extra fee to ensure inclusion in a block would be no issue, nor would waiting for 3 confirmations.  Once the arbitrary 1mb blocksize is updated in the next release, Bitcoin could handle all of the world's large fund transfers.

Unless you count changing public perception as being of no value.

Until someone was able to store actual money into a segwit address, it was difficult to prove in plain language why this wasn't true.  And then someone put $2 million worth of money into a LTC address and said "here, come take it".

I think you should edit the main post to include the fact that it's not simply the number of lines of code that results in credit for participation.  The number of comments here which make that assumption is staggering.
Perhaps use the reply provided by &gt;At the moment deletions and adds have the same weight in the algorithm. We also weigh in commits. And more recent contributions have a higher weight than less recent.
But this can easily be tuned, or made adaptive. Just make a suggestion!
In the end, this should be Github functionality, Mobbr just needs a payment distribution key.

technically, all of those stakeholders will follow the markets.  It's the holders who matter most. The futures market determined the correct ratio of bcash:bitcoin before the fork ever happened (between 10-15% of the value of real bitcoin).  
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:47:25
The most correct answer. Bcash chose to incorporate a set of features which broke compatibility with the bitcoin network. It was not done so in a manner to attempt to gain consensus with the greater bitcoin network. The entire point was to become a minority fork. 
For bcash to call itself the real bitcoin makes no sense from a continuity standpoint.

Oh it's not over by a long stretch. But Bitcoin's dominance is not under threat like it was when the scaling wars were reaching a fever pitch.  The market sentiment was that "Bitcoin is ancient technology and Ethereum is leaps and bounds better in every way", and that's no longer true.

It's not as simple to say that the 'users' control bitcoin. There are layers of complexity with how bitcoin enforces consensus.  You've got the speculators who are interested in price action and volatility, they are what determines price. There are companies and merchants, who are mostly beholden to the speculators -- these companies run full nodes and currency pairings which determine what market activity happens on which blockchain.  The developers provide the software which these economically important nodes are using to conduct business and are especially influential regarding consensus breaking protocol decisions.  The miners provide security to the network through their work and a mechanism for which to validate transactions.  Consumers who use bitcoin to conduct everyday business can also be influential-- albeit in a more limited capacity, since they have less of an impact on price.  
These actors all get a vote, and collectively they are what determines what is bitcoin.   It is a chaotic system which so far appears to exhibit surprising resiliency.  Bitcoin was still able to improve its codebase with a significant upgrade in Segwit last year, despite the seemingly endless state of gridlock and toxicity exhibited by vocal members of these camps.

This is why private blockchains will ultimately fail. It's not just R3. Even if this were multiple gov't agencies, or non-profits, they would still not be able to figure out the basic questions. Who will maintain it? How will governance be handled? How will the costs be recouped? 
They will never reach consensus on these decisions, and many others. And if they could, a shared database would be much more efficient. 
Bitcoin answers all of these questions already. It's not perfect, but it removes the requirement for trust and maintainability.

* Titan
* Serpcoin
* Infinitum
Also a couple great paper wallets:

I assume these are zero fee transactions, so it could be a long time to confirm as opposed to just paying the normal fee like everyone else has to.

I'm not against big blocks, but let's be honest about who is using bitcoin. In order to link a bank account to an exchange one must already have traditional banking services, so using Visa/Mastercard/Paypal is no problem.  To properly invest in bitcoin requires 1-2 transactions. 
1. Move into cold storage
2. Move out of cold storage

Decentralization is hard to define but there are a few main principles. Bitcoin should be resilient from attack by governments and businesses who seek its destruction. To that end, mining should take place by multiple parties, and spread across multiple jurisdictions, with no single entity obtaining greater than 50% of hashing power. Validating nodes should be geographically disperse, and should run adequately on consumer grade hardware and bandwidth. Development should be open source and collaborative, with as much input from the community as possible. 
The ideas above I think are important to keep Bitcoin decentralized. There are certainly some areas where it can improve as well.

The good news is that Poloniex is a reputable exchange, and there are good people running the site who won't try to take advantage of this and keep your money.  If you are who you say you are, just follow the following steps and you'll get your money back.  
Step 1. Do not rush them. Most scammers are impatient and in a hurry, so it will raise flags if you are overly pushy or desperate for a resolution.
Step 2. Figure out a way to demonstrate ownership of your email address or username. For instance, if your email is part of your personal domain, perhaps you can prove ownership of that domain.  Or if your username is one that you've used on several other sites, you can prove ownership of that username.
Step 3. Ask if they can look up records of your login activity from a specific IP address, back when the deposits were made. If you still have access to that IP, you can show that you're attempting to login from the same place as when funds were deposited.
Step 4. Give them all information regarding the history of your account. Things like when you made certain trades, etc.  The more details you have, the more evidence it shows you are the person who opened the account.  Note: if a hacker has gained access to someone's email, they will have information such as withdraw confirmations, so give information that would not be in their email.  
Step 5. Wait.  If there is still doubt, they will want to wait and see if the real person steps up and notices they have been hacked.  The longer time passes, and the more compelling reasons you give in the steps above, the more they'll believe that person is really you.
Good luck.

That's not a very high margin for electronics.  I'm sure for the maker crowd, they can put it together and hack together software to get everything working right. But there are plenty of people who would pay a premium for this.  Greed?  Try running a business on those margins.  You are saying that cost of hardware is the cost of the device. That is just one cost. There is marketing, R&amp;D, support (to help out with any user issues), packaging, included supplies such as thermal paper, and let's not forget items lost in the mail or broken on arrival.  If they accept credit/Paypal, you then have charge backs. If they only accept BTC, you have volatility issues.

To be fair, most shitty small open source projects have only a few stakeholders. You could say the same about virtually every altcoin right now, they all have better governance systems than bitcoin.
However, the difference between W3, Fedora, etc and Bitcoin is that Bitcoin has a much more *invested* community of entrepreneurs, financiers, zealots who have a vested interest in the success of this project.  There are also tens of thousands of people who are closely monitoring every move and scrutinizing it.  
All of this to me would indicate a healthy ecosystem, in which decentralization has succeeded. No one person (not even Satoshi's named successor) is capable of having a significant impact on the success or failure of this project overall.

Good points.  It's hard to attribute Uber's success purely to the internet, at least in the way I think about the internet.  I'd say it was a combination of smartphones, 3G/4G cellular networks, geo-location services, and the "sharing economy". 
Of course the internet allowed those things to flourish.  But unlike Amazon, which really only needed the internet itself to dominate publishing, it's these new combinations of technologies that are disrupting things we never imagined in the 90's-00's.  
What  will it take to ultimately displace fiat currency and the monetary system? IoT + Sidechains?  Decentralized marketplaces + prediction markets?  I'm guessing it will be something we can't even fathom at the moment, but someone eventually will come up with the secret sauce to make it happen.

So let's say a wealthy investor wants to invest $500,000 in bitcoins, with the sole purpose of holding in cold storage for 5 years without touching them. It causes a temporary spike of $10 across all the exchanges as he buys them up, which then eventually settles about $2 higher than when he started accumulating. He just made the exchange rate higher, although maybe only temporary.
But then he tells his investor friends about his investment, which causes them to consider looking into Bitcoin, or perhaps rethink their initial dismissal of the technology.  
There are many people in this camp, and they are all valuable to the ecosystem. Even though they aren't actively spending, they are making contributions by supporting the stability in exchange rate and also through the "well, if he owns some, maybe I should too" network effect.

Same here, and yet I don't confuse Paypal with bitcoin. Bitcoin is a store of value, first and foremost. Even before the fees were high, it was still a pain to use bitcoin for regular purchases.

Keep in mind that "things" are made by companies who can settle transactions off-blockchain rather easily using an intermediary. If BitPay2.0 can settle and guarantee transactions for less than the cost of the mining fee, it will reduce a significant amount of strain on the network. Only when people deduct money from their IOT account will they need to use the blockchain.  
Nobody would have thought during 56k dial-up modem days, that we could stream movies to every room in our house within a short order of time. These things happen as they happen. Solutions will emerge when there is enough of a need and a financial incentive to do so. 
If every transaction is going through Bitcoin, it has a market cap of trillions of dollars, which means the companies who figure out how to solve these problems securely, cheaply, and easily will have significant worth as well.

However, he is correct in that there is still a reward for mining, albeit a small one in terms of USD value today.  Who knows what the USD value of those rewards will be in 20 years.  Additionally, the sunk costs of the mining hardware will still allow for a significant network hashrate for people with low electricity costs. The transaction fees alone will make it worthwhile enough for many people to continue using the hardware they've already purchased.

Right, Bitcoin needed to find out what the base support level was. Turned out it was around the $200 mark. Once this was discovered it quickly went to 500 where it found a new base of ~300 for a while. Since we just went to nearly $800, were testing this new level at around 660. Nobody knows if that's here to stay or if it's going to be lower. Or maybe it's just taking a breather until we test a new ATH.
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:20:21
I like Bitcoin as both an application for real world uses in every day life, and also as a store of wealth. The two are not mutually exclusive. If someone isn't yet interested in getting rid of Paypal but likes the store of value aspect, good for them.  We should welcome them.  Conversely, some people use bitcoin as a more secure method of payment, or quicker way to transfer funds, and would never put more than a small % of their wealth in it.  These people are fine, too.  
Eventually we will see more and more use cases for bitcoin: smart contracts, prediction markets, decentralized marketplaces.  They will all draw different people into the ecosystem, for different reasons.  When the next halving occurs, more gold/silver bugs might join in as they realize the scarcity aspect. If they don't immediately begin to use smart contracts or throw away their Visa cards, is that really a problem?

I don't disagree with you, but what you are presenting are roadblocks to adoption and implementation.  Bitcoin does not necessarily need corporate sponsorship, it just needs to keep doing what it's doing.  Paypal did not need permission from Visa/Mastercard to overtake the online auction business, they simply saw a space and filled it.  There is plenty of space for bitcoin to fill outside of the traditional forms of commerce, simply because the technology (frictionless transactions) will create those spaces in the same way that the internet created a space for companies like eBay.

Yeah because who wants to get caught holding the bag on bitcoins when they gain 5,000 percent in a year.  
EDIT- I'm talking about past results, people.  In no way do I think BTC will gain another 5,000% in 2014 (although it can't be ruled out).  What I mean to say is that I don't understand why it's blasphemy for a business owner to consider accepting BTC.  Sure, on Dec 16th, they would have taken a huge loss in the exchange compared to Dec 17th.  But if a business would have accepted bitcoins in all of 2013, do you really think they would regret their decision to hold them as opposed to converting immediately to fiat?
It's frustrating that people assume business owners only care about getting their fiat because they are scared of volatility.

Even the CEO of overstock has not yet made the decision how he will implement bitcoin. He mentioned the possibility of holding as a form of hedge. His estimates are that BTC will make up 1% of his business upon launch. Companies who hold cash reserves are also interested in investing some of that cash into other investments. It's not crazy for a company to place a small part of their balance sheet into higher risk, higher yielding asset classes to hedge against inflation.

Perhaps, but there's no shortage of problems that bitcoin could solve.  It wouldn't be getting this much attention if it didn't.  I don't remember Bloomberg doing a 12 days of Google Wave segment.

Good for you.  We appreciate you being here to tell them that.
