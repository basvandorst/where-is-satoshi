"bitcoin is never anonymous" - Luke-Jr

I am saying that by *your definition* no hardfork can happen that doesn't result in an altcoin. After a certain point unanimous agreement (what you call consensus) becomes impossible. This is just common sense. You will never get every last person to agree or even know about what is going on. At some point it becomes necessary to jettison the stragglers or influence them to upgrade by simply upgrading. If 90% of the community agrees to upgrade and then another 5% get on board when they realize it is going to happen, it matters little if you want to call it an altcoin. That altcoin will have immediately supplanted the original bitcoin as the coin of choice. The original will be rendered less meaningful than other altcoins that exist now.

How about you stop fucking lying?? Consensus is not the same as unanimity. By your definition no hardforks can *EVER* happen. 100% agreement agreement and implementation is objectively impossible. By your own logic, a single user refusing to upgrade would mean the new fork is an altcoin, because the original still lives on. This is clearly bullshit.

I'd really like a copy of the your dictionary. Did you write it yourself? 
You must realize you are objectively wrong, yet you just try to make up a new definition for the word? WTF?
"Satoshi Nakamoto"  is a *pseudonym*. One can use a pseudonym and still remain anonymous if that is his desire.

Actually, that is *exactly* what it means.

Wasn't that a blockchain.info bug?

That's not ridiculous. It's moronic. 100% is inherently impossible. At 0.00000001% the "original" bitcoin lives on. Luke-Jr is a moron.

If I remember correctly, I had reliable 10Mbps upstream at the time, but it was probably higher. I don't thing the majority of the world's population having something is a realistic requirement for bitcoin. I'm pretty sure the majority of the world isn't even online. The majority has likely not heard of bitcoin and has no interest in it anyway right now. You, yourself, have said bitcoin isn't ready for the average user. So why must it's minimum requirements be set below what the average user already has?

Uh, the Core i7 was released in '08 and the i5 in '09, and high speed internet was already readily available to anyone not living in the sticks. Just because you are practically still on dial-up is irrelevant to to the question. Many systems would have had no problem, and bandwidth availability was certainly not an issue. Just as it isn't now.

Wow, since apparently you have discovered what a dictionary is, perhaps you should look up the word consensus so you will stop misusing it here.
