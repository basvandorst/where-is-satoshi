Not an investment , Im not in any position to invest , simply wanted a reliable service to turn cash into bitcoins that's what there suppose to do bottom line , my situation should  not effect my business in any way with blinstant I paid for a service and expect it , if they do what there suppose to wouldn't be a problem and it wasn't all my money I'm surviving always will its just disappoint. And trying get some help
