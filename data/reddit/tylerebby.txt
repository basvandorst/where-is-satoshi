Yeah don’t buy bitcoin cause if you buy at like 3,000 it’ll go to 20,000 and crash to 10,000

Couldn’t agree more. A crash is coming and for those of us saving and waiting it’ll be like Black Friday but for housing stuff. I own some property and I plan on building my place and won’t be fighting for a job while I’m building so a crash in my opinion is the absolute best time to build. Materials will be low. And I bet household appliances will also be pretty easy to pick up cheap. Not a fan on loans or mortgages so I’m trying to go my own route avoiding the banks.

I like to think of an economic crash as an earthquake, people as houses, and companies as skyscrapers. When the earthquake hits everything that has a poor foundation will crumble to the ground. But everything with a good foundation will last the earthquake. Honestly it’s like gambling on a higher scale. Just got to make sure your assets are on solid foundations. In no way is this a guide to becoming a millionaire it’s just a guide to surviving a crash.

I think it’s gonna float around 7k for next couple months till August and start slowly climbing November 12k December 13k end of year 9k. And we’ll float 10k till spring next year afterwards it’s either gonna start bulling or tank but I believe it’s more likely to have a bull run unless the fud gets bad.
