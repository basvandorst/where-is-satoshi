Coinbase takes a week for the money transfer. Does it really take 2 days for Gdax?

You're looking for the market cap I believe. Look up coinmarketwatch.com I think

It has to do with the miners wanting to mine the new coin, giving them an economical advantage somehow. I'm not super knowledgeable about exactly why, I just know the fork is driving everything crazy and its hard for anyone to truly predict what will happen afterwards

Look into the electrum wallet, I believe with it you will get both. But definitely do your own research

Thanks for the story, I enjoyed it
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:10:56
That's not what is happening. You will have a 1:1 ratio of both the current version and the forked version after the fork. The market will then decide which is the real bitcoin, and most likely one of the two coins will be worth the majority of the market cap soon afterwards

Depends where you trade. The trading platform term you're looking for is called an exchange. Bittrex and Coinbase seem to be the popular ones

I used to use btc on the silk road when it was $13. I have a wallet on a hard drive I threw out, maybe had a btc on there. I never thought bitcoin would be useful after that part of my life... Until a month ago when I gave it another serious look.
But you can't live with regret. You just need to learn from your mistakes and make better decisions.

Thanks for posting this. You've convinced me I need my own wallet
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:13
Yeah, that's a fair point.
Everyone in this thread, lets make all devs stop innovating and trying to create a better project. PayPal exists so its not worth it anymore

Holy shit, haven't heard of this. Have you used it? The idea is sound, seems like a useful service

I got into bitcoin a month ago. I tried doing day trading (and still plan to), but trust me when I tell you this: its stressful and emotional.
On top of that, I got losses while bitcoin surged from 4.1k to 6k, because I was trying to play the market.
If I'd just held during this time it would be pure profit. The market is super crazy right now with the forks coming up, I strongly recommend holding for now. Don't try and day trade it for a couple months, let the bull market work its magic for now

Think about the btc number like you think about the number that shows up on your bank account. Its just a number that represents the amount of money you have in that account.
Btc is the same way, its a number that represents how much funds you have invested. However this number can't be counterfeit or faked due to how the tech behind the number works. Its also safer from hackers is you properly secure it. Finally, this number is going to be valued much more highly than the savings account number, which will only go down in value over time

Many of those "use the internet" commercials did exist in the early 90's, they were called public service announcements.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:05:12
The best way I can explain is comparing it to the number in your bank account. You don't have access to all that cash immediately, its just a number to represent hiw much cash you own.
The btc is just a number that shows how much btc you own. But its number is special, because it can't be counterfeit, and is pretty safe from attackers if secured properly. But what is even better, is that this special number is valued at 5700 of the other number. The value of the btc will only go up, whereas the value of the usd number will inevitably go down due to inflation.

Right. Ive spent my entire life being alive, now its time to earn that coin

Well... It kind of shows how its all about her feeling good right now, fuck the future. I'd dump her too

That's a 2% profit. If you can do that everyday, that's close to a million within a year. A 2% increase every day doubles in 36 days.
At least that's how I'm looking at it, trying to trade up to 2% a day in one account, holding coins for long term profit in another

What makes you think we're close to that point? Oil was only useful for a select group of people at first. As there became cheaper automobilles, machinery needed for oil and byproducts made from that oil, it just kept booming. 
So the 1920 farmers first thought it was stupid, who needed this new age machinery. The 1950s farmer wished he had one. 1960s farmer had one, 80s had five, 2000s farmer had 100...
The same thing is going to happen with cyptocurrency. Right now people think "that's stupid, makes no sense", while people in 2nd and 3rd world countries are beginning to keep their money in it because it is more stable than their local economy.
Already it is proving to be useful for these people, who many have cheap cell phones (another invention that many deemed stupid) that can easily and securely be exchanged for good and services. I mean it can even help from being robbed if your account is secure, cash money can't do that and debit/credit doesn't stop illegitimate purchases most the time (which is money we would get back in America, but good luck getting it back in Ecuador or Venezuela).
And right now, even with how useful it is, less than 1% of the world uses it. As long as the acceptance rate continues to stay the same pace (and I think it'll escalate as legitimate retailers pick up on it), then I don't see how we're anywhere near a bubble. This isn't the housing market which was built on a house of debt. This is a technology built on decentralization and security, which will change the world in 10 years time.

This is gonna be me for the next week. Forgot to submit my work hours last week and I have to go another week before I get paid. I am so angry at myself right now

Doubt it, a kid won't forget that he's secretly rich, if anything he'll dwell on it more than an adult would I think. Kids don't have anything to do all day with their inhuman amounts of energy

One thing I've read about water proof safes is they also keep what moisture they have inside. Just to be safe from this and getting your paper soggy from it over time, keep the paper wallets in a Ziploc bag
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:45:09
That's actually a decent way to get the word out I think. If you go out to restaurants often, maybe make paper wallets with 5$ in btc. Then have instructions on the back with what it is, how to access it etc... 
Tell them to humor you and hold onto it for a year, then see how much its worth. I actually think this could be a great grass roots marketing campaign
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:50:28
Oh yeah I know, it just made me think of the scenario in general. The server gets an increased sum of money if they hodl, and bitcoin becomes more legitimate by the average person, little by little. Seems like a win-win to be honest
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:19:11
Its not even like that with a good investment firm, its very hands off. You do not have quick access to the money, it takes like a week to have access. Then you go on about life like normal, while your money works for you. When you decide to cash out your investments, you can.
I hope your recovery goes well, and congratulations on the windfall. Just try not to do anything hasty to satisfy the current version of yourself, think about the future you with this decision. He's going to look back and be very proud of you one day

Why isn't it a reflection of its usefulness? The true value is something that will equalize out over time. But with a fixed supply of 21 million, many feel its total worth will be much higher than it currently is.
Do you think a 1920s tractor was worth much in the 50s? Not as much because it is older and isn't as useful. This is how we see dollars created through a system built on a foundation of debt. Its inefficient, based on centralized institutions that can choose to print more at will, causing everyone else's dollar to go down in value.
You're looking at it like a market, but what it delivers is more than a market, its an improvement on currency and aims to benefit the people of the world over large corporations

Quantum computing is at least 10 years off. Also there are quantum resistant frameworks for cryptocurrencies
