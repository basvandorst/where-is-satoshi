True that. Stay safe and avoid the dodgy Telegram groups ;)

How is this antisemitic? 2 Israeli brothers were arrested in connection to the Bitfinex hack. This is fact. Nothing against Israelis or Jews. Don't turn this into something it isn't.  Honestly I'm glad that exchange hackers have been caught and have to face justice. Props to the Israeli police.

Well that entirely depends on whether you see Bitcoin as a store of value or peer 2 peer cash. I see it as a bit of both.

A Trezor or Ledger Nano S is also roughly half the price

Sorry my bad. As mentioned previously this refers to Google results of Bitcoin QR codes, not big providers (i.e Binance's Trust Wallet QR codes). I'll fix the headline as soon as I got a min.

Awesome effort. We need more of these

He did. Its all in the article. I think Binance might face a lot more scrutiny on further product releases now though.

Thanks! It looks like the U.S. Copyright Office responded &amp; Faketoshi got REKT

Yeah I've heard of soooooo many similar issues. Not paying withdrawals, non existent customer service, not paying referral fees and much more
@_date: 2019-05-23 06:40:46
That's probably the best option, but there are still a few good reputable centralized exchanges.

I wish I was dude. Then I could probably afford a better laptop. But feel free to check out Binance's Twitter or maybe try read the article.

If this is real, the team has some real balls
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:08:56
Honestly, I think Binance is one of the more reputable exchanges out there. Most seem much worse
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:21:25
Maybe... It would explain their actions
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:24:06
Trust Wallet doesn't work on web nor is it Binance. They specifically mention the Trust Wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:02:19
Hahaha its not a loss if you don't sell
