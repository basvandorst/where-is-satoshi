I've wondered this too.
My honest take is that this whole bitcoin thing is just day trading for nerds/geeks.
No one gives a shit about it as a currency.  They just want to get rich quick by selling bitcoins to people who've just hopped on the bitcoin bandwagon.
Those people who've just hopped on the bandwagon want to do the same thing.
That's why the pyramid scheme label keeps getting tossed around.

This is one of the dumbest things I've ever seen on reddit.

Careful! You'll get downvotes for saying that even though it's true!
Remember bitcoin is a currency...even though all you see are people posting about needing "late adopters" to buy the coins they just bought at double the price.  Don't worry, those people can find later adopters to buy their coins!

Yep. That's why it got downvotes. People hate getting smacked in the mouth with the truth. Bitcoin is day trading for nerds. No one cares about crypto currency or whatever bullshit they try to sell you when they're convincing you to buy low and sell high.
Bitcoin has now become the next day trading "get rich quick" scheme.

No room for logic here!

Anyone who questions the massive drop in quality reddit has experienced over the last year need only look at this post.
The fact that this is sitting on the front page tells you everything you need to know about the type of people now contributing to (and frequenting) this site.

Exactly.  The statement they are trying to make means nothing if you have to pay people to do it.
All you've proven is that it's easy to buy a person's opinion.
You could get one of these people to suck a dick for enough money.

I'm pretty sure you don't know what the word "EVERYTHING" actually means.
