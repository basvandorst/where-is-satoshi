Yeah I love vanguard! I just am sort of split on what to do now. 
A lot of people go balls  deep in bitcoin, but as of right now I am pretty much just investing a little in bitcoin to see what happens.. But the running theory on this forum seems to be that we hope that bitcoin takes over.. 
So I'm trying to decide if I should be contributing to my 401k (which I have been to maximize the match at work) through vanguard or if there was a bitcoin equivalent in index funds? 
Havelock investments is interesting but I don't know anything about the companies to make a rational decision as to whether or not I should invest in them.

Thanks!

God yes

That's what I'm thinking. Wells Fargo or whoever could very easily drop 10M (pocket change) into setting up the most badass mining facility ever. And then it's gone.
If it ever were to become a serious threat to them (which maybe it isn't at this point) it looks like it wouldn't be difficult to destroy.

Oh cool.  Some of the bitcoin people around here don't think it's wise to invest traditionally and to only put money in BTC..  Like...  Maxing out my 401k doesn't make sense..?

So basically you're saying that JPM chase could buy the companies manufacturing the ASICs and invest like 10M in infrastructure.  
If it actually became a serious threat that's like pocket change.

Do you use fiat or bitcoin to do this? I'm just wondering because I don't see a lot of opportunities to invest bitcoin in companies yet.

One of my friends is going to help me set up a laptop that I should never connect to the Internet again or something?  Something about signing? I don't really know but it sounds secure

I'm sort of new to bitcoin so I'm not really sure how this helps invest btc ? 
@_date: 2014-05-29 21:01:24
so i'm an idiot.  sorry.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:08:14
Got it.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:37:28
Are there any company's a common person would have heard of (eg Costco) that you can use Bitcoin to invest in? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:23:43
I like you man. 
That's kinda how I've been playing this game as well.  I've got a little in BTC but I mostly subscribe to the pf model (which is basically vanguard vanguard vanguard vanguard).  
I'm super open to someone that wants to change my view tho!

Sure. I get that not only the time cost and the physical costs of the goods would be extremely expensive. But if it comes down to new technology undermining an extremely profitable business... A corporation will do what it needs for self preservation.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:28:09
fair point.
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:24:46
That's a fair point. So you're thinking it's possible (maybe ideal for us anyway) for a financial institution to integrate bitcoin into their ecosystem?  
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:11:32
I'm just wondering... What's stopping someone with extremely deep pockets destroying the network like this?
Sorry if noob question.
