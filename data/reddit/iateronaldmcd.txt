Simply pay by calculating the byte size of your payment. Check blockchain backlog. Calculate required fee. Check confirmations. Select desired payment channel/hub. Deselect RBF and just hit send. Monitor blockchain to check confirmations. Yes I'm pretty sure not everyone will use Bitcoin lol.

Do you even Bitcoin bro ?

Not seeing any long term price rise due to user adoption only the same old speculators/traders, it was once hoped that Bitcoin's ease of use would be addressed paving the way for mass adoption. Instead we've opted for stunted block size and more layers of complexity. Goodbye Bitcoin hello bitcoinLightningnetworksidechains

BlockStream's business plan, move transactions off chain - yep great blockchain tech there derp derp.
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:47:58
Yay, and let's all ignore the fact that the blocksize limit has completely stalled Bitcoin adoption. Ignore also that Segwit, rbf, sidechains, Luke jr, core, blockstream are also ugly boils that will likely take months and months of lancing and medication to eradicate.

How many times is the moronic word contentious to be used in relation to a hard fork that isn't executed until it gets majority support. If you end up in the minority pull up your big boy pants and suck it up.

The event signalled Bitcoin is near capacity, great news for etha. Expect the whole altcoin market to surge in the coming months, it will make the altcoin rush of 2013 look like a few nuggets in a gold pan.  
  
The altcoin slump had many believing one coin with one core team is a great idea, after core's ignorant handling of bitcoin scaling that myth has been debunked for good.

After a heated debate and a flurry of inactivity it was decided to restrict the size of the table used at the meeting. Chaotic scenes ensued as the backlog of attendees steadily grew. Luke jr attempted to reduce the size of the table further to help ease attendee congestion. Medics treated many at the scene for cuts, bruises and minor crush injuries several had to be stretchered away to the local hospital. Adam Back commented "The meeting was a marvellous success"

You do realise there will be a fork to classic right? This contentious thing that "we" call.......... Is the "we" more or less than 10 People ?

Homesteading ran from 1862 to 1976 - 114 years as bitcoin is only a few years old sounds like a really bad example to use to me --
Echoing the Homestead Act of 1862 which offered settlers ownership of up to 60 acres in exchange for (and after) farming it for five years, small towns looking to boost or stabilize population are giving away free housing lots. This practice, dubbed mini-homesteading, attracts residents and businesses to dwindling rural communities. Free land has drawn folks from across the country and, for a few communities, has saved small town businesses and public schools from closing.

It's like r/Bitcoin has been taken over by the body snatchers, Bitcoin was going to be used by a billion people with low low fees. Now it's taking on a 2013 altcoin innovation 2.0 smoke and mirrors vibe.

The collective labotomy is strong here. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:23:25
By this logic we should shrink down blocks to the size of an atom and charge $200 fee per transaction then just sit back and watch our Bitcoin dramatically rise in value.  
   Remember those heady days when Bitcoin was going to free the billions of unbanked of the world now 1 transaction fee costs more than many earn in a day. We are just very fortunate there aren't any other CryptoCurrencies that can do what Bitcoin does only cheaper........oh wait there are, hundreds of them. Welcome to r/Bitcoin ostrich heads since 2014.
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:13:14
General public isn't taking note of any CryptoCurrency as of yet, if they all decided to use one tomorrow basically it would grind to a halt. This is why scaling is important litecoin choosing a version of bitpays adaptive blocksize scaling is going to be a boon for litecoin. Bitcoins over complicated segwit/fee market is a yawn fest at best at worst. Sorry... I think it is over complicated garbage.
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:08:49
Just hurry and add litecoin to coinbase this will make r/Bitcoin the witch hunters and teeny weeny block bitcoiners hilariously furious. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 15:46:52
Sorry to be blunt but do we need this over complicated garbage ? I thought the original idea was to make Bitcoin easier and easier to use and explain, been around Bitcoin for 5 years and it is pretty much just the same - long public keys, qr codes, copy and paste, paper wallets etc. now comes a whole new layer of complexity this smells and feels like it is straight out of the 2013 altcoin innovation 2.0 handbook under the heading stuff we can peddle that nobody understands, wants, or needs. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:14:12
If you call trying to use bitcoins blockchain an attack lol, but you're right about one thing bitcoins artificially cramped blocksize is the most amazing gift you could give to altcoins. Thankyou Bitcoin &amp; dev team.

@_date: 2016-06-15 21:29:32
If I understand correctly the plan is for Bitcoin to be a high fee low transaction settlement layer (gold), litecoin is going to be used for the bulk of transactions once they've implement a version of bitpays adaptive blocksize scaling solution (silver). This spreading the load across multiple CryptoCurrencies will be a positive thing over time as it avoids reliance on any single development group. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:42:36
Fortunately we are instead going ahead soon with a uncontentious hard fork. The discomfort those against this are feeling right now are the insicions that are being made around the rotten element thats formed in the centre of Bitcoin. The fork that removes this element will be swift, pain free and followed by a rush of relief, similar to the extraction of a wisdom tooth. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 01:31:46
I beg to differ litecoin is set to scale on-chain this is going to be a huge differentiator which is going to set it up as the defecto payment system leaving bitcoin as the bizarre high fee off chain scaling settlement layer. Everything coming from Bitcoin Core these days sounds like fingernails down a chalkboard to me.

Although I'm dead set against this, being 50/50 in btc-ltc this will be great news for litecoin giving it the crown as low fee payment system. 
+ I presume this is why Charles Lee is pushing so hard for this btc high fee settlement layer.
