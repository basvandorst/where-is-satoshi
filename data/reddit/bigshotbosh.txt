Do you think it would be a good idea to get Trezor and put the recovery key in my safety deposit box at the bank?

True true, One of the safes is very well hidden and mounted into the infrastructure, although the one at my place would just be a 100lb one that I would hope would prevent someone from walking off with

Fair enough. I trust the multisig protection, what bothered me was the possibility of not being able to log in at all someday (although i don't think they are like Mt Gox or something)

Sealed the deal on getting a trezor. I can only guess how overwhelmed they've been in the past few weeks but I can't have my money tied up on a place that won't contact me for months at a time
