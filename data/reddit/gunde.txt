Since November 1. 2012, Mt. Gox have refused to release 64,534 BTC and 134,809 USD from Bitcoinica's account to the liquidator appointed by the High Court in Auckland, NZ. I'm just waiting for Mt. Gox to go into liquidation too. I don't even care about the money anymore, I just want to see Mt. Gox burn.

That subreddit has been dominated by miners with Satoshi-syndrome speculating on what PoW the developers would chose. They probably lost interest immediately when they realized that the authors weren't going to release an easily exploitable standalone altcoin after all.

Indeed, although I expected this one to be a bit different. 0.75 million BTC vanished? I have eagerly been awaiting the demise of Gox since it became a verb in 2011, but I still have trouble comprehending the magnitude of this figure.

Zhou Tong tricked a VC into buying his trading platform. When the numbers didn't add up, Bitcoinica was conveniently robbed and completely wiped out. As usual, no backup existed, no police reports were filed, there were no investigation, and a heapload of circumstantial evidence pointing to the whole thing being an [inside job](

By "vanished" I meant that it had been removed from those who thought they owned the coins. I'm not doubting the fungibility of the currency or the robustness of the network. With all the bigwigs still active on Gox until the last moment, for once, a bitcoin scandal could actually have consequences. This time the clients aren't all junkies. The market bounced back just mere hours after the crisis plan leak, but many of the victims haven't even grasped what actually have happened. Looking at  activity there is no shortage of people still in denial, believing the PDF and subsequent chatlog and cat picture was manufactured, or that an infinitely wealthy benefactor will give everyone new coins. Karpeles may continue to goxx us when all the shenanigans he have been doing are rolled up and the tech press starts using pictures of him in cuffs for every other bitcoin article.
Bitcoin will be fine, but I'm not convinced we're landing on Mars tonight. I am of course hodling [sic], so I wouldn't mind being wrong either.

GP implies that the majority of bcash nodes are run by one or few entities. Probably to create the illusion of having a healthy network rather than genuine users. The same people likely control the mining power as well. Nobody is accusing this entity to be Amazon, it's likely the bcash project's founders.

DeepBit will include &lt;2KB transactions for free in its blocks.

Thanks for the tip, although I have no plans to store unencrypted private keys in the cloud ever again.
I got the same responses as Slush published, almost word for word. Even four hours after the attack they claimed to not be aware of any security breaches on their side. According to blockchain.info's timestamps I was the last victim that I am aware of, so the intruder had quite a while to do his business.
I'm still awaiting responses to some of my questions. I don't know the status of the investigation.

By "basket" I meant physically separated systems, not keys in a file.
And as my second link shows, Mt Gox made 2600 BTC unspendable due to a bug in their transaction generation. This would have to happen only once to burn off 400k BTC, as opposed to 400 times if the amount never was consolidated to keys with more than 1000 coins.

Namecoin uses the blockchain as a distributed key-value database. It has its own currency to throttle initial registrations. Unfortunately it worked too well and early adopters speculated on the exchange rate until registration costs exceeded that of ICANN registrations by several times and now nobody uses the system for its originally intended purpose.

A transaction "goes live" when it's included in a block. The miner doesn't need any third party confirmations for that to happen. Most big pools even put their own transactions into their blocks. For your scenario to be true all the big pools would either have to be in on it, or all the other miner's blocks would have to be invalidated by BTC Guild, which they are not. The other pools keeps finding blocks and confirming the chain.
Also, what "role" could you possibly have in the one-man operation BTC Guild?

A lot of the support in the Mt. Gox order book is not there with the intention to buy. Big asks tend to vaporise when the price gets too close. The sooner we can get down to a sustainable price, the better. I'm tired of the slipping price.

Yes, when it was introduced in 2011 it was probably not realized how heavily the measure could be skewed by dormant coins being brought back in circulation after several years.
Coins being repeatedly resent over a short period of time happens all the time for withdrawals from hot wallets where the majority of the coins goes back as change for every transaction.
