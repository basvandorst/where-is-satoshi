nLocktime tx’s which make up LN are inherently bitcoin, but LN, which does the routing on top of that, isn’t technically.

The more rational non-circle-jerk opinion of someone out of this subreddit would probably ask why use the word cryptocurrency? Why not digital currency? I personally know why, but 99% of the population doesn’t.

Just make sure your wallet has zero bitcoin in it and forget about it. There is no way to deactivate a bitcoin address.

BlueWallet for mobile doesn’t need to be online, but it is custodial meaning you aren’t the only entity that holds your keys unless you link your own node.

Not enough people follow dash updates. Default instant send, LLMQ ChainLocks, and instant send linking are all game changers. You can get pretty good level of final tx security on instantsend in around 2 seconds.

I’ve found some bitcoin ATMs that only require a phone number, also meetups, people will likely be willing to sell you small amounts.

Ver is a hypocrite. I don’t think he’s very educated when it comes to communication and he doesn’t understand formality. He fights back in exactly the same ways he was hurt, a childish tactic, IE “bcash” bothered him, so he calls us Bitcoin Core. Also BCH pls is probably the worst slogan I’ve ever heard.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:33:33
Don’t listen to anyone here, bunch of bitcoin shills. Alts get pumped in a few months. Go all in ₿ now, wait for us to get mid-bull run and buy alts when they are are completely “dead.” I recommend LTC, BCH, Dash, and Eth because they’re easy to get out of because they generally have high volumes.
Edit: yep here come the down votes. I’ve been in crypto a long time and I’m probably doing better than anyone giving me downvotes, so it’s just funny.

I’m speaking to the flow chart, not store of value.
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:35:32
I definitely don’t hate that I can send any amount I want in Dash and have it instantly confirm, unlike the lightning networks current limitations of liquidity. I see a few coins other than bitcoin as a good store of value, not many, but they’re definitely not becoming worse stores of value.
