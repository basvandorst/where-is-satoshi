Probably depends on the teller, if you look/act sketchy, they might submit a suspicious report

*Real* freedom scares the shit out of conservatives. They like to be free from government taxation but turn around and forbid people from doing anything remotely out of their comfort zone, I don't understand how anyone could justify forbidding people from smoking cannabis if they wanted to.

Trump has no intention of removing cannabis from Schedule 1. He said that he wanted to leave it up to the states to decide, but that doesn't change the federal laws.

Because the FBI agents were found to be sketchy and corrupt as fuck, they were literally convicted for stealing and blackmailing people.

TLDR, there was never really a murder, and the "hit" was created by two FBI agents who were later prosecuted for blackmailing and stealing hundreds of bitcoins from various people. He was never tried for this alleged crime because it's likely the whole thing was fabricated by the corrupt FBI agents.
