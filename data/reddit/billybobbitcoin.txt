I agree this sounds like one of the most promising reasons for success.

Current bank account backed debit cards already handle that.  As do VISA gift cards.

I have to agree, I'm quite unimpressed with Amir.  The business stuff he mentioned about South Africa sounded pretty interesting.  But other than that I'm kindof scared that he holds a high role in the bitcoin project / community.  At least Gavin seems well grounded and reasoned.
Amir: please drop that spanish programming comparison.  Your whole I'm a programmer and I can read code so I know "bla bla bla" can't ever happen reeks of noob.  [Having said that]( I hope you do your best to help bitcoin succeed!

Depends how you define fair, but yea you could: Have a central organization mine a majority of the total coinage before releasing it to the public.  Then have that organization sell them off at a fixed rate until they have none left.  You'd have to require some strong identification before selling to people to limit amt sold to a single person.
Would this be a good idea?  Would this screw up the market value after the initial "fair" selloff?  no idea

Other than the 3% fee I don't know if anyone sees those as real issues for normal debit card transactions.  Could you really convince consumers and business to switch to your system because of those things?

 I think the problem is no business can get successful if they only accept bitcoin.  Merchant accounts and/or paypal is the cost to play the game.  Bitcoin would have to be successful _first_ before this happened, which means it's not a scenario that's going to make bitcoin successful.
 Is there any reason why game companies would use bitcoin as a currency in their games rather than make their own?
 I'm sure bitcoin will be used for this but I don't think it will make bitcoin successful as a currency.  Probably more likely to kill it if that's the only big use of it.
 Again, bitcoin has to become successful for this to happen, not the other way around.
 This might happen, although not sure if it alone could make bitcoin succeed.
 Think this falls in same category as

Anyone have any more info about the thing Amir is working on?
"Working with one of the largest mobile companies in South Africa with goal of providing bitcoin services for mobile phones"

Doesn't matter where you put/encrypt your wallet.  Once you actually launch the bitcoin client locally, you'll need to have your wallet file present and unencrypted locally.  If you happen to have a trojan on your computer at the time which is just waiting for your decrypted wallet to "show up" then you're fucked.
The only salvation from this is to A) never get a bitcoin wallet stealing trojan (good luck), or B) don't keep your bitcoins on your computer, but instead use an online wallet/bitcoin bank.

I know quite a bit about bitcoin.  I know all the listed advantages to fiat currency.  The question is how do those advantages translate into actual "widespread" adoption of bitcoin.  If those advantages dont solve any real world problems then that adoption is unlikely to occur.
@_date: 2011-05-27 20:35:13
sure but it's also gonna increase the chances governments go on the offensive against bitcoin which could be the end of it
@_date: 2011-05-27 14:14:24
Is that likely though?  What makes it more likely to be the one online currency compared to online currencies run by big organizations?
@_date: 2011-05-28 20:25:59
My guess is shutting down mtgox would be really easy.  All they need to do is shut down their bank account to prevent money going in through ACH and Wire Transfers.  I think mtgox currently uses Dwolla so one phone call or national security letter to dwolla saying dont do business witht mtgox would probly be the end of that.  Along with a big news story saying BTC no longer has any reliable method of trading with USD I think could just about do it.
If we get 10 other Mt Goxes before that happens then things will probably be harder for them.  So yea hopefully they don't get worried about it enough until then.
I would love to see a bunch of distributed currency exchanges but I don't see how any of them could work at scale.  Do you have any info on how one might work?  And don't link me to distributed currency needs a distributed exchange blog post.  I highly doubt you could pull that type of x/c off at scale without getting a huge flag for fraud.  
@_date: 2011-05-28 00:10:23
lol I'm not sure that's what I was looking for but that was awesome...
I think your doomsday scenarios would never happen though.  I think it'd be really easy for government to shutdown all BTC to [any major currency] exchanges really quickly.  Just look at how quick the US government shutdown wikileaks' financial operations without any actual public decrees or laws.
My question was really _how_ might those scenarios happen, not what they could look like.  I'm really trying to gauge if people have any actual creative ideas for problems (very valuable problems) bitcoin could solve.  I've only heard one really interesting thing so far and that's what Amir talked about on the This Week in Startup Interview.

good luck, people care about money, not dns
@_date: 2011-05-27 19:11:42
I agree. I was just trying to give an example of an idea.
@_date: 2011-05-27 19:06:08
What is the advantage of using bitcoin as online payment over credit cards, other than the 3% fee?
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:53:54
yea, fair enough
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:11:42
I highly doubt Google will integrate it unless it get successful by another means first, but we can hope.
About the debit card idea, why is it any better than a normal bank account backed debit card?
I doubt it will succeed by nothing more than its current gaining popularity.  If something bigger than the current economy growth doesn't happen it's highly likely there will be a big speculative crash which might not be recoverable from.  And even if recovery does happen it makes it much more likely that competing bitcoin-like currencies step in and potentially "beat" bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-05-27 19:04:36
well, to me at least
@_date: 2011-05-27 21:39:04
Fair enough, but I did say the brainstorm was for what will make bitcoin successful not how to know when it's a success :P
 I agree speculators are helping bootstrap the currency, my question is mainly once this bootstrapping ends/goes-away will what's left be enough to keep the currency afloat.
 I kindof agree with this but at the same time I don't think big game companies would use bitcoin unless they felt it had reached a certain adoption level, probly much bigger than the current one.
 What I meant was if criminals using the currency was a big enough % of the bitcoin economy this could cause governments to work harder to shut it down.
4) Eh, I highly doubt that's happening on any significant level, people are investing/speculating but most likely putting very small %s of their assets into it.
