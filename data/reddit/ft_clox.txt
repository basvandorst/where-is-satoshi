I have a strange feeling about this guy. And its not just that the way he is communicating doesnt sound at all like a guy from Wall Street or someone who runs an investment firm.
Edit: Nevermind, obvious scam.

Someone who is not a scammer would post a picture with timestamp of himself now. Thats the only way you would really attract people here. 
The fact that you didnt do that and your way of communicating gives you away. Now go home, neckbeard.

I dont like it at all. It doesnt transmit any message, it just looks like a decent pic.

see the bullshitters are entering the market.
Also, I loved how they explain that they make profit because people are willing to overpay and in the end of the video they say their own product will be overpriced (demand much higher than supply).

Look at him being too stupid to use the tip bot and tipping the fedora_tip_bot instead of the user he wanted to tip.

"On 4th January, the exchange’s website indicated a 24-hour trading volume of just 2.87 BTC, which has dropped sharply from its usual level of around 100 BTC per day.
In comparison, China’s leading exchange Huobi.com, saw a trading volume of 100,737 BTC during the same period."
So who cares?

More adoption --&gt; More trade --&gt; Less volatility.
Bitcoin markets and exchanges are relatively small and simply dont have the number of traders active on them to reduce the price volatility. Yet.
Gold was much more volatile decades ago. When the Euro started the currency was very volatile.

So you are not comparing two different things here, trading in markets that are fundamentally different to each other just because a graph looks like it could be a bubble.
What if I do a 5 second google search and find a graph of a random stock that supports my point. Is that evidence too?

It was a single order as far as I see it, because it happened in an instant. I could check the blockchain to verify. 
I don not think it will pop, because these massive buyers are in fact price manipulators. The same is true for the big sellers. I believe both are attempting to make money, the big buyer buy pushing the market upwards, the big seller by causing a price drop and buying it all up again at a lower price.
@_date: 2013-12-25 19:54:30
Two very different things. Also, most gays dont care one second about gay slurs.
The problem here is not the gay slurs, but the person who calls people 'nigger', is openly anti semitic and constantly posts lies about BTC and attempted to manipulate the price or people on this subreddit with incorrect information and scaremongering.
Just look at his comment history.
People who behave like this should be banned. period.

@_date: 2013-12-22 10:54:19
I am still not quite sure how the volatility will change over time, as more and more people use and trade BTC. 
a. More people = more trade = less volatility
b. More non-whales trade in a market where more and more people hold ever smaller amounts of outstanding BTC = Whales have much more impact as the relative size of their portfolio increases.

Bitcoin will reach its inherent value in a few years. This can very well be $10000+, where we will most likely refer to it as uBTC or even smaller quotations. The thread of dumping huge amounts is not very likely in the short term. If it happens, you shouldnt care because Bitcoin will reach its real value in 5+ years.

Many companies in the stock market try to keep their share price roughly around something like 20-180 depending on the currency (for €/$ cases). The reason being that those prices make them more fungible, as people are more likely to buy say 5*20 than they are buying a stock worth 100. Many small investors dont buy Apple stock, because they have to spend $520 to buy a single stock.
Stock splits are often done to keep the price at a more fungible level.
The special case for bitcoin is (a) that the majority of people still dont know that you can buy bitcoin in any fraction from BTC to µBTC and so on. That keeps a lot of people out, because "what am i supposed to buy with a coin thats worth $700?"
(b) the current market prices are the best marketing i can think of. Just think about any person who finds out that there is a "Coin" that is worth $700+ "I must have a look at that!".
Sooner or later, every exchange will show market prices for bitcoin in µBTC, and BTC will be a thing for early adopters and whatever people now are.
Just give it a few years. (and buy, hold and retire)
