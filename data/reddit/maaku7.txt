Scripting is compatible in the sense that it becomes only SPV secure for those that do the sync-from-pruned-history thing. You can still have scripts be validated at the tip. Same goes for locktime (although u/andytoshi has a scheme for locktimes in particular), and other obscure validation rules for transactions. I personally don't think this is a problem -- require validation of the last (say) 3 months of blocks for a full node's first startup, and don't expose mining RPCs until the *entire* history is validated. That's technically SPV security, but with sane defaults that make exploitation of it impractical.

Sure scripts can be kept. There's absolutely no reason to get rid of scripts. But if startup by syncing the UTXO set instead of downloading the historical block chain then you have only SPV assurance that the scripts were executed.
IMHO that's totally fine. Especially if you make the miners sync the whole block chain, but even without that SPV assurance is incentive compatible here.

Zane, this is many times larger than the block reward for the duration of time that has elapsed. Have you considered getting a list of transactions to blacklist and getting miners to reorg the theft? The window of time for that hasn't closed.
(If this happened in the last day, then that's 12.5*144 blocks = 1,800 BTC in subsidy. That's &lt;2% of the hack.)
EDIT: Posting more information here since this is getting linked to.
The security model of Bitcoin rests on the economic incentives which prevent miners from working on large reorgs. Those economic incentives go away when the possible gain is many times larger than the miner's normal income. This is a fully known property -- is discussed in the original Bitcoin whitepaper.
In this case, Bitfinex could promise to pay the miners, say, 25 BTC per block for however many blocks it takes to reorg out the theft transactions and replace them with a spend aggregating the funds off of BitGo and into cold storage. As long as this is less than a few thousand blocks, it makes economic sense for everyone involved, simply because of the *enormous* size of the theft.
That this is possible at all is a failing of bitcoin's decentralization. In 2010 or 2011 it would have been very difficult to just call up 51% of the mining power and do a business deal. Going forward we should do everything we can to make sure that bitcoin is made even more irreversible than it is now, and that such mining deals are more strongly disincentivised. I hope that this serves as a wake-up call about the dangers of decentralization.
To be clear I have no money in Bitfinex. Never even opened an account there.
EDIT2: To be absolutely clear I hope that this doesn't happen. If it does, I'm not sure what value proposition bitcoin would have left. Uncensorable, nonpolitical money is what bitcoin is about, and without that it is nothing. If this manages to go through, I hope the outrage pushes people to fight for more decentralization and fungibility at the protocol level. Otherwise I don't know what future bitcoin would have.

If mining is centralized then Bitfinex can simply enter into contracts with the miners which provide explicit terms for reimbursement. If the attacker burns as fees then the miners are collecting property which is known to be stolen, and which they explicitly acknowledged as stolen in the contract they signed. I believe you are not taking into account the extra-protocol leverage that is available.
Mining needs to be (1) decentralized so that it becomes impossible in practice to gather a quorum of 51%, and (2) anonymous so that even if one did the RBF incentives you suggest would protect irrevocability.

Please let's ignore the minting of new bitcoin. That is a completely uninteresting and useless application of a blockchain. The system's creator linked the two together in order to bootstrap the network, but there's really nothing interesting to be said about tying the initial issuance to proof of work, quantum computation, or anything else. Satoshi could have given out the full 21million bitcoin to his closest buddies and it would have worked out the same in the end anyway, as far as the relevant and interesting properties of bitcoin are concerned.
Those interesting properties are things like censorship resistance, and irrevocability of transactions, which in turn derive from the fact that transaction selection is provided by a rotating anonymous, dynamic membership set of signers, and that work used towards achieving an election is committed -- it cannot be re-purposed or reused in alternate histories -- and progress-free.
If nothing else your description of the quantum bitcoin mining algorithm is not progress-free. An adversary can "pre-mine" blocks by solving the classical work function and then mint blocks on demand (e.g. to double-spend) using saved up solutions and a quantum computer.

It really depends on whether you are talking about the wire format for a transaction and block, or the abstract Merkle tree format of a block. You are right that witness data is serialized alongside the transactions of the block (unless the communication is with an old node, in which case they are elided entirely). But within the abstract block format the witness really does live in a different part of the Merkle tree under the coinbase transaction--including them with each transaction would have been a hard fork as it'd change the Merkle tree structure in a way visible to old clients.

I rather strongly disagree. This should develop organically in the same way bitcoin did - which involved random people on the internet trying it with real money within their own comfort and risk profile.
To dissuade people from using it directly undermines decentralization as well as the ethos of bitcoin. This isn't nanny banker money, this is consenting adult money where you choose by what means you manage the keys to your own funds. If you choose to take risks as an early adopter, that's your prerogative and no one should dissuade you otherwise.
If you want a payment system where you are protected from losing funds by someone claiming to use their smarts and knowledge to protect you from bugs or exploited vulnerabilities and decide for you what is safe, then bitcoin is not for you to begin with.

Alternatively, let's say your a generous tipper. You take the $10 bill in change and leave the $5 on the table. In bitcoin terms, we have a transaction with "$20" as input, and two outputs: "$5" to me and "$10" change to you, and an implicit miner fee of $5 (because 20 - 5 - 10 = 5 leftover).

There's "real" supply and demand which is independent of the order book, then there is the artificial supply and demand created by traders which dominates by orders of magnitude.

That valuation would still be 20x global GDP. And the velocity of money for a real asset being used in that way, not speculation, is a lot higher than 1 trade per year, which would further drive down a reasonable estimation of target value.
Things do not experience fantastic growth forever. I'm not being doom and gloom predicting a crash either. We're on a very standard S-curve adoption, inside the exponential break-out phase. At some point it will level out to a meager single-digit-percent per year growth on par with the economy as a whole, even in the most optimistic of realistic scenarios.

It would be a "generic med" in the same sense that antibiotics are. A given antibiotic targets a specific class of microbes, and each variant of DRACO would target a specific class of viruses, but in both cases these classes span multiple disease agents. They're likely both to be medications available only be prescription for similar reasons. (DRACO-resistant viruses can and will develop, although many diseases are likely to be eradicated entirely, so making these sorts of antivirals available over the counter would be asking for long-term trouble.)
Why is big pharma not putting money into this? Because it is insanely more profitable to sell treatment regimens that lessen symptoms and extend life expectancy rather than fix the underlying problem. This is not conspiracy but simple plain-as-day fact: the revenue that could be generated by curing a disease is pennies compared to the opportunity cost given up when there is a once-a-day antiviral regimen that keeps it at bay instead, at $10's of dollars or more per-patient, per-day.

Both traditional pay to pubkey addresses and P2SH addresses (including P2SH-wrapped-P2WSH segwit addresses!) have the spend conditions (pubkey or redeem script) protected by a 160-bit RIPEMD hash.
It takes on average 2^160 guesses to come up with a private key (there is more than one) that will spend funds protected by a pubkey under that hash. We call that a 160-bit security against "preimage attacks," or 160-bit preimage resistance for short.
Alternatively, we can look at how much work (guesses) it would take for someone to come up with two different pubkeys or scripts which hash to the same value (address). This may seem like the same question but it turns out to have a different answer due to an interesting statistical fact called "the birthday paradox." It gets its name from the fact typically used to illustrate it, that the number of people you need to gather in a room until it is likely that there is at least one pair sharing the same birthday is only 23. Even though there are 365 days in the year, if you pick 23 people there are better than even odds that two of them will share the same birthday, even when we assume they all have equal probability of being born on any given day. The explanation for this is that the first person in the room has a random birthday (given) and the second person has only a 1/365 chance of sharing the birthday with the person already mentioned. But the third person has a 2/365 chance because there are two other persons he could match with. By the time you get to the 22nd and 23rd individuals, there's already a 21/365 = 6% chance they match someone else. Properly computing all the probabilities you get to 50% likelihood when you cross from 22 to 23 people.
An alternate way to prime your intuition, note that the number of pairings is 1 (when the 2nd person walks in, there is 1 person he can match with) + 2 (when the third person walks in, there are 2 people she can pair with) + 3 + 4 ... + (n - 1), and that we should expect 50/50 odds when the number of combinations gets up to near 365. The sequence 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) is equal to n * (n - 1) / 2. Note that this is quadratic -- there is a n^2 term in the number of combinations. So double the number of people and you quadruple the number of combinations, roughly. It should not be surprising that the number of people needed to get a 50% chance of matching birthdays is (approximately) close to the square root of 365 (which is a little more than 19, for the record, while the actual answer is a little more than 22).
The math for hashes work similarly. The first time you make a guess you get an effectively random value back. If you keep that guess around, then the next guess will have a tiny 1/2^160 chance (1 in 10,000,000,000,000,000) of matching the first one. But if you keep these hashes around, the next one will have a 2/2^160 chance, and slowly but surely these probabilities grow. By the same reasoning as in the birthday problem, once you reach sqrt(2^160), you have a 50% chance of having found a collision -- two preimages that hash to the same value for the given 160-bit cryptographic hash. sqrt(2^160) is 2^(160/2) = 2^80. So we say that a 160-bit cryptographic hash has 80 bits of "collision resistance."
Got it? Now we can get to why this matters. For pay-to-pubkey, it generally doesn't. A single person has the private key, and they generate the public key, from which the hash is made. The only way to attack this is to find a value which hashes to the same value his key does, and that takes 160 bits of work (2^160 guesses) which is simply impossible even if we turned the whole planet into a computer. Anything over 100 bits is considered secure, with 128 bits being the nice power-of-2 target security threshold.
But what about pay-to-script? Most people using pay-to-script are using multisig, and multisig is where you have two public keys provided by two different people. Let's say you and I want to make a multisig: I ask you for your public key, I provide my public key, and we both combine them together into a script, the script is hashed, and the result is encoded as a 3... style address. But here's the trick: when you give me your key, I stop time as I take it and then I start making up random keys and hashing them in two different scripts: one pays to the 2-of-2 multisig you wanted to build, and the other just pays to my key only. I hash both scripts, and add build a list of each type of hash. Since it's December, let's call it the Nice list (2-of-2 multisig with you) and the Naughty list (just my key!). By the same logic as the birthday problem, I should expect that after 2^80 tries I will finally have one item on the Nice list that hashes exactly equal to some other item on the Naughty list. I then resume time, and pass the key from the Nice list back to you. You hash it with yours and send funds. I then pull the matching key off the Naughty list and claim the funds, using that key alone, not needing yours. Coins are mine!
It's not too hard to fix this instance. Both parties commit to their keys first, share the commitments, and then reveal. I can't find a collision until I get your public key, but you won't share it until I commit to my own, which means I can no longer perform the attack. Security rises back up to preimage resistance levels, 160 bits. But this fix is specific to the example I gave, not generaliazable to every use case. You can't have offline nodes / non-interactive setup is impossible. Some smart contracting applications involve treating scripts as black boxes -- you shouldn't *have* to care what additional script conditions another party is adding to their execution pathway, but the fix forces you to have some sort of understanding to make sure they're not sneaking in grindable entropy. Even if you fixed all that, you wouldn't be able to prove, after the fact and to a third party, that the script doesn't have a collision, since the security proof is dependent on your own unverifiable memory of who knew what, when. Maybe this is important when doing things like cross channel payments that touch some contract you weren't involved with the creation of, because you expect all resolution pathways to go one way when they actually go another because of a collision.
Finally there's the fact that even when there is a known fix, the simplest, most naive way to implement multisig results in people shooting themselves in the foot and losing money, or at least if/when there is 2^80 bits of computing power at a reasonable price. But if there is one good assumption to make, it is that overworked and overstressed coders will always take the path of least resistance and do the simplest, dumbest thing possible, even if it sets people up for losing money. So the best, most utilitarian thing to do is to make the simplest thing to do also a reasonably safe thing to do. And achieving that is simple: increase the hash size from 160 bits to 256 bits, giving a collision resistance of 128 bits. Now even the dumb, minimal security, nobody precommits to anything protocol still requires 2^128 guesses, which is safe enough.
Got it? So here's the final breakdown:
P2PKH (1... addresses) has 160-bit hashes, but since a single key is involved from one party, we need only be concerned with preimage collisions, for which it has a 160-bit level of security. (Multi-party, split-key ECDSA is possible... but the situation there is complicated, nobody does it, and this post is long enough.)
P2SH (3... addresses) hash 160-bit hashes, and where the script and all its keys and other components is fully created by one person, the story is the same: 160-bits of security from preimage resistance. However for general classes of scripts and when there are multiple people involved, collision attacks may be possible which reduce security thresholds to a 2^80 bits of work, which is concerning even if it is not (currently) feasible. This also includes P2SH-wrapped segwit outputs!
P2WPKH (bech32, version 0, 20 bytes) is the shorter segwit form of P2PKH. Meant for when there is only a single-signer key, it has the same properties: 160 bits of security through its preimage resistance. It just uses segwit and is a little smaller.
P2WSH (bech32, version 0, 32 bytes) is like the segwit version of P2SH, but instead of using RIPEMD-160 as the last step, it uses SHA-256, resulting in a 256-bit hash. It therefore has 128 bits of collision resistance out of the box, making any script secure from hash collisions no matter the protocol used to construct it -- which is good belts-and-suspenders cryptographic safety engineering.
Clear as mud?

No quite the opposite. You should be using more complex policy than a single signer signature, for your own safety, like a 2-of-3 trustless 2FA or 2-of-2 with time-out release of funds. But doing that right now fully identifies the wallet software you are using, or worse the specific wallet and thereby deanonymizing you. MAST would allow you to just reveal the spend condition used, which will be a 2-of-2 or 3-of-3 without revealing any of your wallet specific recovery conditions or smart contract contingencies. Far from being suspicious, it’ll let you hide in the crowd.

Not quite. Coins can be "provably destroyed" in a variety of ways. Notably OP_RETURN data outputs are not part of the UTXO set of a full node, so burning coins by sending them to such an address destroys them just as thoroughly as not generating them in the first place. This is quite different from the 1BitcoinEater address which *is* spendable, if one knew the discrete log.

You’re missing the point. Bitcoin doesn’t become magically valuable on its own. It went from worthless Internet Monopoly money to its current valuation because of the investment into technology and infrastructure, and the investment into public awareness and usability that many thousands of people have put in on top of that. People who simply buy and passively hold have done nothing to advance that and are parasites profiting off the work of others. They are the roommate that never does the dishes or clean the bathroom.
There is another group of people who have done this throughout human history: the bankers. I don’t know about you but I got into this space to get rid of that kind of disgusting parasitical enslavement that does nothing but constitute wealth transfer from those who have little to those who have much already on the basis of nothing but those holdings.

Except this isn't true. The construction he used is provably not stronger, and possibly weaker. If SHA2 is broken then it doesn't matter what hash function follows in the composition because the first hash function colliding will make everything else collide. If RIPEMD160 is broken there might be interplay between the two that lets you speed up the search for a collision.
The double-hash composition is an example of cargo-cult cryptography. It doesn't actually add any security in this context. There ARE constructions which would have improved security, but they come with costs:

Nobody wants money. Money is either something you exchange for something else you want, or a status symbol and power over those who have not. It's not an end-goal in itself.
What do you want in life? Most people fail to answer that question because whatever the answer is they haven't enough money to achieve it, so they seek money and put off asking those questions. Maybe that's what you mean?
I'd suggest sitting down and really sorting out what you want to accomplish, what makes you happy, and what would be a life worth having lived. Like 99% of the people out there, you will find that the answers to these questions require resources you don't have, and the near-term solution is to work longer, invest more, and generally make more money. But unless you have a weird (and sad) money-counting fetish, I suspect mere accumulation of money is not the driving purpose in your life, or the lives of the 99%.
Most people want security for themselves and their family -- meaning a house that's theirs and food on the table, indefinitely. Good health. Time to spend with their family and friends, or doing hobbies they enjoy. Obviously money buys time, security, and the consumables of life. Many people, though sadly not most, want a purpose or cause to work for, and money gives them both the time to work towards that, and the leverage to achieve it. But none of these motivations are for money for money's sake. If that's what you're chasing, I suggest you take some time off to consider what you're doing with your life and why.

Hats off to the people in this community who did this.
As someone who has been in this space peripherally since 2010, and quit my day job to work on bitcoin back in 2013, few people believe that I’m not a crypto-mega-millionaire. Sure, my highest holdings were around 350btc at one point in time — back when that represented a few tens of thousands of dollars. And I sold nearly all of it over the first six months after I quit my day job with no savings other than the bitcoin, to focus on bitcoin development full-time. I received a further 200btc or so in donations in the year that followed, also right out the door into expenses as it allowed me to focus on protocol improvements instead of consulting work.
It’s mind boggling to think of how much money that represents now. And indeed whenever the topic comes up, as much as I try to avoid it, the response is always “why, why didn’t you HODL?!” Well how the heck was I supposed to pay rent, put food on the table, or afford doctor’s visits for my pregnant wife? While spending every waking moment learning, inventing, coding, and explaining bitcoin to a pre-“blockchain” world that had no clue of its existence? I hit rock bottom in early 2014, having spent nearly all my funds (retirement, cash on hand, bitcoin, and available credit) on cost of living while refusing to get involved with the lucrative pre-ICO altcoin premine scams of the time, and locking up the $10k or so of what was left, other than a few single-digit cold wallets I’m still hodling, in an ill-advised bet on the solvency of MtGox.
I don’t say this looking for a hand out. As luck would have it my work caught the attention of others, and I was able to get in on the ground floor of co-founding a moderately successful (though it remains to be seen) startup you've probably heard of. And even if the stock options end up worthless, I’ve managed to draw a salary to support my family while still inventing things for bitcoin, and I’ve squirreled away what I can of the bonuses my company pays in bitcoin. It is a reasonable nest egg now, even if it is a much smaller number of coins.
But still does my blood boil when I hear accusations that I, the core developers, or the other intelligent people I work with **must** be bitcoin-rich just by virtue of when we happened onto the scene. Nope. In fact my experience has been that those *most* involved with bitcoin, those who drop everything and *dedicate* their lives to it, are those who end up profiting the least, relative to the others who took no risks and simply hodl. Andreas is not the only crypto person I know to have given away hundreds, if not thousands of bitcoins to random strangers, bitcoin projects, and their own reasonable expenses, all for the sake of the cause, just to end up with a handful of bitcoin leftover they hope will one day be enough to retire on, earning only the smug contempt for being “poor” from those who selfishly hoarded and politicked rather than make positive contributions and self-sacrifice.
So kudos to those of you who gave, and through your action show that this community can have the heart to give back to those who made it all possible in the first place. As someone who was once not so long ago in a very similar position to Andreas, it warms my heart to see this outpouring of support. It goes to show there is still good in this world.
Andreas: thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the things you have said and done, and for all the sacrifices you have made to bring awareness to the people of this great project we are working on.

This is not correct. '3' addresses are P2SH addresses. These have been in use for many years to implement things like multisig. It just so happens that a segwit address can be encoded / wrapped inside of a P2SH address as a legacy compatibility hack, and some wallets support this as an interim step before bech32 addresses (native segwit) are widely deployed. But you can't know if a given 3... address is segwit or just regular p2sh unless someone told you the redeem script involved.

Try measuring your 1st world connection to a peers around the world. You will find, as Jonathan Toomim did, and Matt Corallo before him, that most global point-to-point connections crossing continental and in some cases national boundaries have truly horrible bandwidth, latency, packet loss, or all three.
"But my cable internet works just fine at 150Mbps!"
Yes, that is 150Mbps between your modem and the switch down the block. Remember when you did that speed test after installing your latest whiz-bang broadband connection? Remember the first part of the test when it said "choosing server based on ping.."? That was it cheating because it knew that it would only ever have a chance of finding out your local bandwidth if it selected the server next door (also if you paid attention you might have noticed the server was associated with an ISP: it probably *was* right next door to your upstream switch). You're probably only able to saturate most of that bandwidth because any web service worth its salt pays a shit-tonne of money to have its data propagated to local servers in that same datacenter you so that when you access that 4k cute kitten video it buffers and starts playing without delay.
Newly found Bitcoin blocks aren't something you can cache in a content delivery network, especially under adversarial assumptions. It is new, never-before-seen data that must propagate from whatever remote corner of the world it was found to every single Bitcoin node, and be validated at each step along the way.
So global point-to-point connection quality is what matters. And the state of that is not as good as you might think.

The thing is the spot market determines the value of the futures. The CFTC ends up having to regulate the spot market to make sure that there isn't any spot market manipulation, because that is how one goes about manipulating the futures market. They've claimed regulatory authority over spot markets before for this reason.
Regarding bitcoin being a currency not a security, that's just like your opinion, man. There are many government authorities claiming authority over various aspects of the bitcoin industry, and they all seem to have different views as to what bitcoin is. Although you or I may have a very clear technical argument about how bitcoin should be treated, it's ultimately up to the prejudices of the regulatory authorities.
Bitcoin meets the definition of a security that the SEC has laid out in its opinions and actions against ICO operators of late: a speculative asset meant to appreciate in value due to the actions of those involved in promoting it. The only weirdness regarding bitcoin is that it doesn't have a central issuer.. so who would you prosecute?

Thanks for the gold kind stranger!
To the first question, yes the first collision likely to take a crazy amount of time. However with computational power increasing at an exponential rate, it won’t take long for such an attack to become possible in a reasonable amount of time. We’ve seen this happen with 512, 1024, and 2048 bit RSA keys for example. Additionally, one collision might be all you need — the Google SHA-1 collision was specially crafted to be reusable such that you could use it to create any two colliding PDF files that display different content but hash the same without doing any work. Potentially you can do the same with bitcoin script.
To the second question, all that matters is the last hash, which is 160 bits. The segwit script on the Nice list will have a 256 bit hash in it, but it’s then passed through a 160 bit hash function for P2SH to get the value the coins are actually sent to. The Naughty list will have different segwit 256 bit hashes of which one will further hash to the same 160 bit target as one from the Nice list. The last hash is what determines collision resistance.

Fees are lower and security higher with bech32 addresses, since it doesn't require the on-chain P2SH wrapping workaround. Any segwit supporting wallet *should* support bech32 at this point. It's the standard. We should push people to use this, and only give out '3' addresses when someone is *sending* from a wallet that doesn't support bech32.

I’m sorry to tell you this, but that IS the norm going forward. You cannot have a globally used decentralized ledger with bitcoin’s utility without a relatively low limit on transactions and by implication relatively high fees. That is the future and there is nothing that can be done about it except hope bitcoin stays niche (don’t want that), or give up decentralization (use bcash if you want that). If you want to avoid per tx fees then you need to move to second layer solutions like lightning.

Hepatitis had a trivial cure that was discovered by accident. I actually knew the guy that “invented” it. I worked with him a few years back before he passed away. He loved telling the story about its discovery as an example of serendipitous science. They were not looking for a cure. They were not even looking for hepatitis. They were doing blood analysis in the field and data reduction errors from noisy blood analysis. They developed a physical filter to get rid of that noise. Turns out that noise was hepatitis, and the filter sorted out the non active junk. The original hepatitis vaccine was literally as simple as collecting the filter, putting the slime in a needle, and injecting it in someone not showing symptoms. The crud was &gt;99% inactive viral bits and it primed the immune system to deal with the few live virus that came through, as well as any future infection. Oops, accidentally cured hepatitis and won the nobel prize.
Much of the early vaccine cures was the low hanging fruit — viruses that have shapes easy for the immune system to recognize and clean up, or don’t do tricky things like lay dorman in cells or tolerate mutation. While there are a lot of viral diseases with vaccines, you don’t generally see as much research into cures today as you do suppressive antiviral treatments.

Let me try to steelman the opposing viewpoint, the one which honestly thinks non-Bitcoin blockchains or permissioned ledgers are the next big thing in finance:
What "blockchain" brings is a programmatically extensible standard for cryptographic money ledgers. Think FIX with cryptographic extensions. The bitcoin block chain format can be used for interop between banks, auditors, and customers, and in doing so all the bitcoin-derived technology for mobile wallets, multi-factor security, signed messages, payment channels, etc. can be used out of the box for electronic dollars, loyalty reward points, or whatever.
Of course I happen to think the most important feature of bitcoin is its decentralization, which permissioned ledgers lack, and which will make those entities which don't adapt entirely irrelevant :) But the "blockchain, not bitcoin" position is not entirely out of touch with reality... just the last attempt at relevance of a dying breed.

"Evil fork" is the term that has been used by people who have been aware of this idea, which is not new but has purposefully not been publicly discussed. Unlike a soft-fork it coerces the rest of the ecosystem to either (1) be dragged along and upgrade to support the fork, or (2) upgrade to a version that forks off the fork. "Opt-out by not running the new client" is no longer an SPV-safe option.
Note that while changing the block size from 1MB to 2MB is relatively benign, you can use this same technique to do anything including confiscate coins, change subsidy for perpetual inflation, etc.
EDIT: To be clear, there is really no reason why you would want to go this route, if you accept that hard-fork changes should be uncontroversial. This is a really complicated way of pulling off a hard-fork change in a way that twists people's arm in order to make them upgrade rather than relying on them voluntarily upgrading. That's a bad thing if you ask me.

TPS is a fairly meaningless metric. How much TPS do we get with transaction cut through? How much with Lightning? The only measurement that really matters is about 1MB of tx data per 10 minute block, with high variance. It's just that now the witness doesn't count towards that limit..
To answer your question most directly though, by the same metric that people say bitcoin is currently 7TPS, segwit would be 13TPS (comparing apples to apples with witness/tx ratios of present transactions).

What I described was not a result of the relay network. I wasn't talking about the relay network at all. In fact the relay network attempts to fix this issue!
This is the simple mechanics of how large block propagation works -- large blocks mean delays, delays mean advantages to large hashrate miners. Miners with bad network connectivity experience even higher delays, and that profits them not the rest of the network.
This is a generalization of the selfish mining results. Right now any miner or mining cartel with &gt;30% of the hash rate stands to benefit from purposefully delaying announcement of blocks they find. Not broadcasting gives them an *advantage*. It seems paradoxical, but extensive analysis and simulation bears this out.
If that happens now, people will notice, complain loudly, there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth, etc. However if it is the network that is the problem -- if miners legitimately try to broadcast their blocks as fast as possible, but poor network connectivity causes delays and delays benefit the miner, what are you going to do? There's nothing that can be done at that point.
Do not cloud the issue. This has absolutely nothing to do with the relay network, except in that the relay network actually attempts to fix the problem in the non-adversarial case. This is a problem with bitcoin, and a pretty fundamental one too.

There's a part theymos missed in his description, which is that blocks need to propagate across the entire network in 30s or so. How many hops does it take to cross the network? 10? That means you need 170Mbps upload.
But that number is meaningless. Because Bitcoin is a global peer to peer protocol your bandwith to your peer is unlikely to be same as your total upload capacity to your ISP. Real connections are often limited to the range of 1-3Mbps or so. Such is the state of the global Internet.

4MB base limit? I.e. change MAX_BLOCK_SIZE to be 4000000? Yes, I think that would be a decidedly reckless thing to do. For one, it would make it somewhat trivial to create a block that takes &gt;10min to validate -- while including paying user transactions too. What effect that would have on mining incentives and strategic miner behavior is unclear.
There are ways of fixing such vulnerabilities, such as changing the metric from "block size" to something which actually reasonably tracks validation and/or relay cost. Segwit steps in this direction, but I feel we can do even more. See Jonas Nick's Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong talk for more info.
To clarify, what I am saying is compromise is possible but not if "compromise" means picking a position on the block-size number line. The issue is quite a bit more complicated than that and deserves a more nuanced solution, which we are beginning to see the start of with segwit.

You are mistaken. The bitcoin network right now makes it incredibly easy to pull off a double-spend with near 100% probability, for any transaction.

I believe that you have got it backwards. Bitcoin's prime utility, the one thing it provides that you couldn't replicate with faster, better, cheaper alternatives is distributed, decentralized, programmable, global consensus. Currency is just one such application, and a necessary one to build other non-currency applications (because the currency acts as a unforgeable, rate-limited token).
The value is what you can do with programmable decentralized global consensus, and for that to work a decentralized currency token like bitcoin happens to be necessary.

Then we might as well use something like Stellar's consensus model. If you're willing to trust first-order approximations of miner incentives, then there's no need for this energetically wasteful, centralizing proof-of-work thing.
Seriously, there is some really cool shit being worked on out there that beats the pants off Bitcoin in terms of scalability ... if you are willing to make additional assumptions about miner behavior. I, on the other hand, think there is some inherent value in being a fully trustless mutex arbitration protocol.
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:58:30
The truth is we're running out of ways to make Bitcoin go faster in the form of software improements. We're not by any means done, but there's probably only room for a small, single digit multiplier when we add together all the potential stuff being talked about today.
We can debate about whether 2MB, 4MB, or 8MB is safe with the current network. But what's needed for the every-human-being-on-the-block-chain, moonshot case is gigabytes or more per block, if everything were on-chain. We are simply never going to get there with software and hardware improvements alone: it's just not possible. I don't see any pathway for doing so that doesn't involve unreasonable assumptions.
So we want to support every person in the world making every transaction with Bitcoin, but we know we can't put all that information on the chain directly. So we need some way to scale that capacity off-chain while preserving or even improving upon ALL the same user-protecting properties that an on-chain transaction has. It is this kind of thinking that led to payment channels and the Lightning network.
The word "settlement" has become loaded, so I'll try a different phrasing. Here in the 1st world we have contracts for just about everything, and courts of law to handle disputes about them. But not every contract is executed in a court by a judge -- only the exceptoinal cases. Imagine if every time you bought a coffee from Starbucks, Starbucks had to take you to court to claim their $5. I don't have to tell you that wouldn't work! You'd need more lawyers and judges than there are people on the planet.
But right now every single transaction is being settled by block chain arbitration. What we imagine, with Lightning, is a world where only the exceptional cases -- where one or both parties see a contract as broken -- are arbitrated on the block chain. When Alice pays Bob there's no reason for that to hit the chain unless Alice tries to double-spend, or Bob claims the payment didn't happen, or other such failure mode. We imagine a world where every non-contentious payment can happen off-chain, and the on-chain transactions are mainly used for administrative stuff like setting up channels or making one-time large payements to/from cold storage. *This* is a vision that can scale -- using the courts and arbitration of the block chain only in the infrequent occasion of dispute (e.g. counterparty went offline and I want my coins back) and administrative trivia.
Now the connection to "need big blocks now!" is that scaling to bigger blocks is a de facto one-way street: once we increase the block size it will be like pulling teeth to get it back down again. We *know* that we need to transition to an active fee market. We *know* that below a certain price point we are going to have to move transactions off-chain if they are to process at all. We *know* that a whole heck of a lot of infrastructure will have to be updated to make this happen. And we also know, with certainty from past experience, that if we just say this loudly nothing will happen -- because nothing did happen when we had these debates a the soft-limits of 50kB, 100kB, and 250kB. Blocks actually have to get full before wallets and service operators respond :\ So let's coordinate to make the changes we need to make now while we still have a buffer zone -- if something goes wrong we can still do an emergency bump to 2MB or 4MB and the sky won't fall. It's just basic belts-and-suspenders engineering to make sure that we don't have disruptive events when there is absolutely no excess capacity left to respond with.

Because (1) as software developers we can't do much about those other limitations, as they are things with non-protocol fixes; and (2) they do appear to be reasonably decentralized at the moment.

I should amend my statement which is quoted in the OP. I should have said just "exactly the same relay delays" as the story with validation cost is a bit more complicated. Segwit actually has *better* validation costs than a straight 4MB increase because there are limitations on how much "larger" a block can be constructed. Many of the worst-case validation times are achieved using tricks that are fundamentally limited in the case of segwit to the same as 1MB blocks. Furthermore any block that includes user transactions or things looking like user transactions cannot fill the 4MB space (more realistically, 2MB). So in terms of validation cost, segwit in the average case would be about 2x the size and 2x the cost of a typical 1MB block -- for 2x the transactions -- but the adversarial worst case remains roughly the same as a worst-case 1MB block in terms of validation cost OR 4x as bad in terms of relay cost.

We are not working on Lightning specifically as an expect-to-be-profitable business product. We are working on Lightning because it is what Bitcoin is most in need of at the moment.
When we first started Blockstream there was many conversations we had with customers directly along the lines of "how can we integrate Bitcoin into your product?" Almost inevitably every single conversation would end up on the topic of payment channels networks (then called hub-and-spoke networks) as the way to scale their application. But of course there weren't any implementations of payment channel networks at the time. Shortly thereafter three things happened:
* Poone and Tadge released their lightning network paper which combined the state of the art in hub-and-spoke payment channels with some smart contracting ideas to solve the last remaining problems with payment channel networks in order to create a fully trustless, efficient design. They also came up with a way better name (Lightning).
* For unrelated reasons we were about to hire Rusty Russell who was I believe the first person other than Poone and Tadge to work on Lightning and share his work publicly via his blog. We were going to task Rusty with other stuff but he expressed an interest in Lightning and...
* In response to our constant pushing of payment channels as a viable path to scalability, one of our critics said, paraphrasing, "if you're so hot on payment channels, why aren't you working on them?" ... and he was right! At the time there really wasn't that many people working on the idea. And if we really think, as we do, that Lightning-like networks are essential to scaling Bitcoin, then for the Benefit of everyone we should put our money where our mouth is.
So we decided to task one full time employee, Rusty Russell, with implementing Lightning. Furthermore we gave him complete independent freedom in doing so. We told him to keep it fully decentralized (something we did not need to tell him to do), and he calls the shots. He tells us what choices he makes during implementation, not the other way around.
Lightning is an important part of our business strategy only because we honestly believe it is the future of Bitcoin for reasons that really have nothing to do with block size -- Lightning solves the far more critical problem of instantaneous payments and distributed exchanges. Solving these problems are important to Blockstream's business because we are a b2b services company. Lightning makes possible solutions to problems our customers have, and we'll make money helping them come up with integrated solutions using it. But we do not stand to profit off of Lightning directly in any way.

By role in that specific context I meant how much money they are moving in which direction, at what fee. In essence the funds are moved across the channel, but with a contingency added to revoke the transfer if something goes wrong elsewhere in the path.
You can think of lightning as a two-phase commit protocol where the payment is setup one hop at a time by moving funds with a contingency, and then moving backward through the path finalizing the transfer and removing the contingency at each channel. If something goes wrong the contingencies are settled on-chain with timeouts.
Any on-chain transaction requires miner fees of course, so the longer the channel is open and/or the more frequently it is used, the lower the effective amortized fee that is paid by the node for each off-chain transaction.

IBLT does not fix the bandwidth issues at all, under adversarial assumptions. If a miner wants to purposefully create a huge block that achieves no compression under IBLT, they can.
Pieter seems to think that 1MB block + 3MB witness would be at the upper limit of what could be safely supported today, and the numbers I have seen would make me agree. Although note that 1+3 is not the same as 4MB block -- the 1MB limit on non-witness data prevents O(n^2) validation cost attacks from being any worse than before. So for myself I think that with segwit we could probably support 1+3 "4MB" blocks, otherwise even 2MB blocks would be dangerous.
Weak blocks in principle might be able to punish bad behavior by miners. I have yet to see a scheme that claims to do so which is not hideously complicated and hard to analyze, however... More research is needed before conclusions are drawn.

There are two parts to that: why a fee market, and why now.
Why a fee market: Because will at some time fill up, and stay full. Maybe you think 8MB blocks is safe, fine, but 8GB blocks most definitely is not. Yet, if everyone in the world was using Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions, blocks would be on that order of magnitude in size.
Why now? Please see the last paragraph of my post above. The longer we delay in adapting infrastructure to handling a fee market properly (and the changes aren't that complex!), the more risk we add. It's easier to do now than later, so let's get it done now.


The fees would be paid by the other party.


There isn't. There's lots of other off-chain options too, and we should be exploring them all. They're not exclusive options.


Zero. (Overcapacity actually removes miner incentive not to make attack blocks, thereby reducing safety. From a mining incentive standpoint Bitcoin is safer with full blocks.)

The prior comment was written from my phone, so was a bit terse. To expand and elaborate, the system requirements for running Bitcoin Core, the foundation of any bitcoin service stack, is not very demanding. ~100GB of hard disk space, ~2GB of RAM, and any x86 CPU manufactured in the last decade. The SSD will help speed up re-indexes considerably, although lots of RAM and some custom db settings would do the trick as well. Even the cheapest of the cheap &lt;$200 netbooks meets those requirements. It may take 3 days to perform a reindex, but once synced it will keep up with new blocks just fine. The more demanding requirements are whatever you are building on top of the base bitcoin layer:
Some sort of web app or service? Then you will need all the tools and infrastructure of web-dev: a database, request-response handler, caching layer, back-end task processors... and since you want testing/development to match production, each of these is running in an isolated VM. You'd probably want at least 12GB of RAM and a beefy processor.
Some sort of bitcoin-integrated game? Well you'd need a high-end gaming laptop to run the game itself plus development tools.
Wallet or user interface development? You'd definitely want a lot of screen real estate so you can have your prototype and dev tools open side-by-side.
Point is whatever it is you're making drives hardware requirements far more than the bitcoin stack itself.

In addition to all the factors of access to capital, access to chip fabs, access to power, etc., there is also the fact that large established players are given a preferential advantage in the protocol for no other reason due to being large established players, due to block propagation delays. The magnitude of this effect gets larger when blocks are larger or take longer to validate.
It is important to censorship-resistance that new players in the mining space have exactly the same advantages as existing players. If such a condition is violated we end up with entrenched monopolies doing transaction selection, which would undo the assumptions underlying our censorship resistance.

It depends on what you mean by scaling.
Let's be clear on one point: a "4MB" block using the segregated witness soft-fork has exactly the same validation cost and relay delays as a 4MB hard-fork block. Segregated witness does not make the block validate any faster, or be transmitted around the network any faster. However there is much more to "scaling bitcoin" than the cost to fully validate and relay a block:
Initial block download is a concern, as discussed by Patrick Strateman at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal. The larger the blocks, the longer it takes to download the entire block chain history. Segregated witness allows the syncing node to skip the scripts for old transactions that it was not going to check the signatures of anyway, thereby shortening the initial block download.
Those signatures which are downloaded can be thrown away immediately on a pruned node for transactions that are not in the wallet, a very significant cost savings for disk space sensitive nodes.
Lite clients have to store and transmit transactions in their wallets. Generally good things to do like CoinJoin bloat SPV wallets because they result in larger transactions with signatures from other parties that you don't care about. With segwitness you can prune signatures that don't need to be kept, resulting in a much smaller data storage requirement.
The implementation of segwitness being proposed includes other witness data besides the scriptSigs which make compact fraud proofs possible. This opens up the possibility of sharded validation for partial full nodes, better security tradeoffs for SPV nodes, and perhaps advanced applications like sidechain withdraw fraud proofs.
And perhaps of nearest significance to scaling bitcoin, segwitness is one of the two soft-forks required for Lightning, the other being BIP 112 which is very close to being merged into Bitcoin Core. With both soft-forks deployed, the best, most efficient, full version of lightning can be deployed and payment channel networks start to be used to replace on-chain transactions.

IBLT has problems. IBLT works basically by assuming what the block would be from the transactions in your mempool, and transmitting the differences. The trouble is, this results in strong policy centralizing influences -- you only get the benefit of IBLT if you have the same policy as the everyone else. That kinda undoes the entire point of having decentralized mining to provide censorship-resistant transaction selection.
Gavin's numbers on block size are absolutely bogus. They are an extrapolation of his personal home Internet connection, which has no relation to the global uncached bandwidth which Bitcoin uses.

I find it much more preferable that each individual business will run its own lightning node with enough channel capacity to handle its cash-flow needs. For example a Bestbuy or Wallmart will slowly fill up its channels with customer orders, then pay out via lightning to its suppliers, wages to employees, rent and other expenses, etc. This is the way the Lightning network is designed to operate. Being a profitable business they will eventually start to fill capacity, at which point they close a full channel with the coins going to cold storage, and open a new empty/half-full one.
Now I'm aware that this is a variant of the argument "merchants will run their own full nodes" when in fact we've seen that few do. The best I can do it make sure that it is as easy as possible for such people to become full bitcoin/lightning citizens by running their own nodes.
Will it be the case that people with large amounts of capital will pool it to run well-connected lightning hubs? Probably. I don't see anything we can do to prevent that. But we can absolutely make it a feature of the protocol that hubs are not required, and have Lightning work just fine without them. That way the worst-case censorship by a MoneyTransmitterLN hub or whatever would be that the user has to pay slightly higher fees to route around the popular hub.
Will Blockstream run a hub? Honestly I don't know, it's not my call. But the protocol is being designed to make potential hubs as irrelevant as possible.
As to your assumption, I think what you are missing is that the lightning payment channel network is not going to resemble, say, a network connectivity graph with "last mile" links serviced by single large organizations. A user could have any number of payment channel connections to anywhere in the payment channel network, some to big hubs if they exist, and some to other small businesses or individuals which provide censorship resistant links.

I suggest you watch some of the talks at Scaling Bitcoin. In particular my talk and CodeShark's talk at Scaling Bitcoin Montreal on validation costs and exactly how bad a block can be constructed with adversarial miners with various block sizes. Turns out 1MB is plenty bad enough:
And I recommend watching jtoomin's talk from Hong Kong. He's a BIP 101 advocate who collected data which in his own analysis shows that current network only supports max 3-4 MB in the average (cooperative-miner) case. Protection from adversarial miners would require lower limits:

The wording is a bit ambiguous. It's up to Alice to find the path, but path discovery is part of what the LN protocol specification will address. When Alice comes online she syncs her state of the payment channel graph using lightning protocol messages, then uses that graph to find a minimal fee route.


As a worst-case estimation, sure. Note that these costs are only born by Alice, not the lightning network as a whole or even the nodes being routed through.
In a moonshot scenario where there are 7bn people using Bitcoin via LN, O(V+E) scaling could get annoying (not impossible for workstation-class hardware, but annoying). But there are pathways to make it work even in that scenario -- you could track the routes you care about and their immediate neighbors up to some local memory limit, and then pay a route-finding server for routes you can't figure out locally, when you need to.


The payment fails/timeouts and Alice either finds another route or resorts to an on-chain transaction. The process of unwinding the transaction reveals the information needed for the other parties to unlock the funds which were going to be part of the payment.


Depends on the cost of an on-chain transaction vs lightning fees. It is entirely reasonable that lightning payments may be many orders of magnitude cheaper than an on-chain payment. But there are likely to be frequent cases where LN payments get expensive, either because the destination is not well connected or because intermediate channels are filling up. In this case it does make sense to open a channel directly, for approximately the same cost as an on-chain payment, then collect fees of transactions routed through that channel. This is exactly how the LN grows organically in response to market forces.

Well, for example I'm presenting the the topic of what is being called 'flexcap' at Scaling Bitcoin HK. The idea is that users pay for larger blocks via the fee market in a way that is not gameable by the miners or by someone with a load of cash the blow. If users are really willing to part with their money in the form of higher fees filling burst capacity, then so be it: adjust upward to larger blocks. (But to prevent someone burning money to create artificial pressure to increase blocks for reasons other than actual demand, it will adjust downward when that pressure dissipates.)
This is a compromise of the sort that if users are really willing to pay the fees for larger blocks, then the block size will increase. It's a relief valve of sorts. But it is not an automatic growth pathway that takes us down a path of necessarily increasing centralization pressures.
As to fixing the dramatization of bitcoin development, I don't have an answer. I hope I'm not portraying developers as being fickle or temperamental. It's just that so much of the developers are volunteering their time, and there's just only so much abuse and thrown shit that you can expect a volunteer to put up with before they decide their limited time would be better spent elsewhere, for their own quality of life if nothing else. It's already driven me out for reasons I'd rather not get into on Reddit.

The title of the post is correct. The description is I think technically correct, but perhaps misleading as we're seeing in the replies.
What excited me about LN when I first heard about it was exactly that it was an implementation of Ryan Fugger's ideas on bitcoin. I had been very interested in the ideas of transitive trust transactions, and along with another co-founder of Blockstream, Jorge Timon, had authored the only prior design of transitive transactions on Bitcoin: Freimarkets. However our design required far more invasive changes to bitcoin and didn't achieve the off-chain scaling properties of LN. So needless to say I was ecstatic to find that LN does everything we were trying to do and more, while requiring fewer less-invasive changes. And indeed after concentrated effort of many people, we got the number of needed changes down to a subset that is very likely to be deployed in the near future (segwit and CSV).
Now LN as a concept is quite general. Using any kind of asset issuance (e.g. colored coins, or native assets on a sidechain) you can do the IOU issuance and credit swaps that is original vision of ripple. You can also do the same exchange-of-credit algorithm using redemption tokens for locked bitcoin (payment channels).
Right now in the bitcoin space what you're hearing about is LN-with-locked-BTCs, not LN-with-IOUs. But both are possible. And, I believe, both will be in wide usage in due time. Locked-BTC has the same properties as on-chain BTC today. Credit IOUs provide a dynamic monetary supply and let BTC be kept in cold storage at the cost of explicitly managing trust lines, but without the systemic risk of legacy credit markets. Credit IOUs can also be used with other assets than BTC as the backing currency, which is a viable pathway to having distributed, decentralized fiat on the blockchain.
LN *is* a reinvention of Ripple Distributed Protocol, using bitcoin smart contracting primitives and the block chain for arbitration. All those cool applications of Ryan Fugger's ripple that were discussed back in the day (distributed exchanges, credit markets, elastic money supply, etc.) are possible with LN as well. But LN-with-locked-BTC is interesting as it does not involve trust in any way, so the "lines of trust" in original ripplepay can be made in fact entirely trustless and managed without any user intervention.
Pretty cool.

The harm is that it could kill bitcoin in the mean time. Bitcoin is **nothing** without decentralization. Bitcoin the Currency gains all its value from its policy neutrality, and Bitcoin the Blockchain is the absolute worst, most inefficient design _unless_ what you care about is decentralization.
I've been around Bitcoin since 2011, and seriously involved since 2013. In 2013, just two years ago, we had hundreds of thousands of full nodes and a fully distributed mining economy, ensuring that Bitcoin would remain fee of destructive centralizing policy influence.
Oh we were optimistic back then. And a little bit naïve. Some of us thought that ASICs would keep mining decentralized as efficient hardware was commoditized. Turns out most independent miners were driven out of business by narrowing profit margins and/or mining scams. Some of us were convinced by back of the envelope calculations and napkin sketches that there was plenty of room for scaling and that Bitcoin would remain decentralized with 1MB blocks, 10MB blocks, 100MB blocks, or even larger. Turns out that the real scaling limits that affect decentralization are not bandwidth but matters of software performance and network latency, both of which have become serious issues even before 1MB blocks.
We've gone from 100k nodes and thousands of miners to 5k nodes and a mining quorum of a half-dozen individuals. Bitcoin hangs by a thread, and is in very real danger of being subverted or destroyed entirely. To repeat: bitcoin is worthless without the policy neutrality it gets from decentralization, and the decentralization is almost gone.
I would like to scale bitcoin to have blocks hundreds of megabytes in size, all things being equal (I'd also like a pony and a unicorn). But all things aren't equal -- scaling the block size comes at great cost to decentralization, and there is no longer any room left to give. There are technological improvements in the near and medium term which might give us better scaling properties. There are also hard fork changes which could be made which would yield reasonable constant-factor improvements to scaling, and we should not be talking about doing a block size limit fork without such changes.
We need to be making what changes to Bitcoin Core we can to help it cope with larger blocks: improved block relay, serving blocks from pruned nodes, probabilistic block checking with fraud proofs, etc.
We need to be deploying infrastructure (wallets &amp; services) that deal well with full blocks: replace by fee, child pays for parent, etc.
We also need to be deploying infrastructure that allows bitcoin usage to scale in a trustless way beyond the current block size limit: first micropayment channels, then lightning network.
When we've done that, and we have better data about the decentralization tradeoffs being made, we can consider a hard-fork to increase the block size, among other things.

The argument isn't about transaction fees, but rather block propagation latency. Larger blocks take more time to reach other miners, and thereby yield a selfish mining advantage. This advantage grows the larger the block size is, and for large (&gt;&gt;1MB) blocks can be on the same order of magnitude as the miner's profit margin. That means making large blocks could double your profits, or alternatively the competition making large blocks could put you out of business.
Regarding your question, decentralization is not about node counts, relative or absolute. The important question is whether an appropriately non-localized network of auditors can be maintained, and whether the bar to participation can be set low enough that average users -- or hidden users (e.g. Tor) -- can participate. Otherwise you are outsourcing your view of the network to centralized entities that are ripe targets for attack or influence.

It's more like how a "60W" LED bulb actually only uses 6W of power.. but the socket is still rated for 60W so you could in fact get a massive, blindingly bright 10x more powerful bulb and stick it in the same socket, without any issues except having to wear sunglasses indoors.
So it is with segwit. By pulling the witness out a 1MB block becomes 500kB, as far as the byte counter in the consensus code is concerned. So you could actually create a double-sized 2MB block and have it pass the "1MB" block validator which doesn't count, or at least discounts the extra witness information.

You obviously couldn't have known, but in fact I was intending to present segwit as an overflow talk if there was room at Scaling Bitcoin HK. As Pieter talked about it does have impact to scaling by allowing historical data to be pruned or not downloaded at all, among other things.
But when it was discovered that it could be implemented as a soft-fork, Pieter took on the task of doing so, and in doing so merged a whole lot of extra features such as the back-links necessary for fraud proofs, and script versioning. That took it from being an overflow "if there's room" talk to what was, IMHO, the most important talk of the workshop. Kudos to Russell O'Connor, Pieter, Rusty, Luke-Jr, Maxwell, and everyone else who contributed ideas that became a part of this work.

Have you looked at the code? It is quite simple.
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:37:18
It's a fair question. That exact same argument could be made today -- mining is almost completely centralized, yet this was not the case in 2011/2012 when blocks were around 50kB in size. The situations is a bit more complicated than that makes it sound, but let's run with it. Do you really think it would be possible to convince the entire bitcoin ecosystem to regress to 50kB blocks?
As a pragmatist I think it is safe to say that once capacity is added it will be used, and once it is used it will be like pulling teeth to get people to change their infrastructure, business models, operating assumptions, etc. It probably would be easier to just start over.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:08:48


I'm sorry I could not provide more detail. Things are in motion, and people are working on various technologies that will help the mining centralization situation considerably. I don't think anyone is confident enough to say "here's the path forward! do X, Y, and Z and mining decentralization will be ensured!" We simply don't know enough about the dynamics of the problem and the solution space to say that with certainty. But there are a couple of paths forward and I'm hopeful that you will see announcements of progress in new technologies in the near future that will do a great deal to alleviate this situation.

@_date: 2015-12-02 04:47:56
I'm not so sure. Right now Bitcoin Core is developed by a ragtag group of hackers who are interested as all hackers are in doing something fundamentally new and interesting. Bitcoin is exciting not because it enables some new business model, or gains x% efficiency over legacy fintech systems. It attracts these developers because it provides a fundamentally new service that has never before existed in the history of mankind, and which could be radically socially transforming: distributed, decentralized, programmable consensus. We are inventing the future here. It's the same feeling experienced by world wide web hackers in the mid 90's, before the dotcom boom. We knew we were changing the world fundamentally and forever, and *that* was what motivated us. So it is with bitcoin.
But interestingly there is a tradeoff between the utility of bitcoin (it's ability to process transactions) and these fundamental properties. To scale bitcoin to handle more traffic in a naïve way might very well destroy its decentralized nature and turn it into a very uninteresting continuation of the legacy system. What would happen if this were to come to pass? Well I can't speak for everybody, but I know what I would do, and I've had conversations with others on the top-10 contributors list. We'd declare bitcoin a failed experiment and move on :\
What I believe is being interpreted as arrogance is simply the belief that what matters about Bitcoin is not the topic de jour among users, but the as-yet unrealized social transformation. Users are asking for "more transactions now!" while developers are worrying about, and creating solutions for fungibility and better privacy. Is this a disconnect? Yes. Should we make the developers stop and refocus on what user's want? Only if you really want the developers themselves to leave.

I have written about why decentralization is a non-negotiable property of bitcoin:
I suggest reading the post, but in summary: without decentralization there is no reason to use either bitcoin-the-currency or bitcoin-the-block-chain as better alternatives exist or could be made. Bitcoin's only value proposition is as a decentralized asset and accounting ledger. Everything that gets you and me excited about Bitcoin either derives from its decentralizaiton, or could be done better in a different way if we were willing to sacrifice decentralization.
I have also written about we need to do to address the issue of blocks filling up:
In short, we need to fix simple deficiencies in how wallets handle transactions in the face of a fee market for access to a block, and learn be less wasteful of how we use our limited block size resource. There is no block size which would support every person on the planet using Bitcoin the way we do today without giving up decentralization entirely (the boil the frog, death of bitcoin scenario), and increasing the block size now only buys a few months of time at the cost of sacrificing an inordinate amount of decentralization.
There are things people are working on *right now* which would allow us to scale better within existing limits -- fee markets, micro-payment channels, etc. We need to take advantage of fee pressure provided by a low limit to solve this problem now, while it is still relatively easy to do, rather than kick the can down the road and wait for the problem to become exponentially worse.

@_date: 2015-06-18 08:05:21
The purpose of Bitcoin is to provide a policy neutral transaction ledger. Bitcoin is nothing without policy neutrality, and that neutrality is achieved and maintained through decentralization.
Bitcoin the currency has value because Bitcoin is decentralized. The peer-to-peer issued currency exists because any other type of asset would undermine Bitcoin's decentralized properties. For example a centrally managed asset would yield certain levels of economic control and thereby policy influence to the entities which manage the currency, and a backed currency would be at the whims of whoever manages the redemption or controls the underlying asset. A peer-to-peer issuance is necessary condition for policy neutrality. But when the network loses decentralization then there is no longer motive to maintain a tacked-on currency when more convenient assets like fiat are available. And let's be honest: having this extra currency attached to the network is not a selling point to regular businesses that ultimately just want to transact in dollars or euros. More and more these days we are seeing projects aiming to bring “blockchain technology” to the traditional financial sector. Make no mistake – what is being talked about is fiat over blockchain rails. If you believe as I do that there is benefit to having a truly policy neutral transactional currency, or if you simply hold bitcoins for their perceived future value, that should be very concerning to you.
Bitcoin the proof-of-work secured accounting ledger is valued only because of its decentralized consensus properties. As far as consensus systems go Bitcoin is horribly inefficient, even evaluated against other distributed consensus systems. If decentralized, policy-neutral accounting was not a requirement, then a simple Paxos-like consensus algorithm would be more than sufficient while enabling orders of magnitude more transaction volume. Indeed, this is approximately how fidelity bonded off-chain transaction systems, Ripple, Open-Transactions, and Blockstream's federated consensus models work. Ultimately the world cares about the Bitcoin ledger not because of cryptographic money or programmable signature systems – those are cool, but could be made to work in more centralized systems as well. The Bitcoin ledger is important because it is policy neutral. It is a true commons available to all and free from monopolistic interference of any kind. However as the network becomes more reliant on centralized nodes, it become possible to exert legal or extralegal influence over these nodes, thereby reasserting monopolistic controls.
You want to make it such that only large corporations run full nodes? You want to make it such that it is impossible to run a full node over a wifi connection from ad-hoc networks around the globe, or via a Tor hidden service? Then you will have centralized Bitcoin policy determination and auditing into known, fixed locations. All we'd be is a few national security letters away from completely undoing Bitcoin's user-protecting properties. This this is an outlandish scenario? Wait until only the likes of Coinbase, Circle, and Blockstream are running full nodes in the US and its allies and then watch as a more draconian federal bitlicense bill then international treaty are passed.
Of course what will probably actually happen is that since &gt;50% of mining hash power is on the Chinese side of the Great Firewall, Bitcoin will effectively become determined by Chinese government policy moving forward. And they don't even have the decency to require warrants from secret courts before interfering.
Nonsense, I won't let that happen you say! But if you're not running a full node ... how would you know? And even if you were, but mining policy was fully centralized, then what could you do about it?
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:50:23
One of those is not like the others. Larger blocks is the only thing you listed which actively trades off decentralization. The others achieve scalability without sacrificing the nature of the network.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:42:52
It seems that they understand very well. Bitcoin is that ledger that results from applying a fixed set of consensus rules to block validation. If you change those rules, you have in effect created a separate ledger and separate cryptocurrency. There are those who follow the old rules, and those who follow the new rules. It is totally fair to call these separate currencies, and in fact it is fair to say that the original rules have more claim to the name than the new rules, so the new ruleset defines a new (alternative) coin. Altcoin.
That said, all of the intentional consensus changes that have been made since this dynamic was understood have been intentionally constructed such that the old rules and the new rules converge on the same ledger in practice, so nomenclature really hasn't been an issue. But with a hard fork that is no longer possible.
That they are making this distinction tells me that they understand very well what is going on here.

If you look at the lighting development mailing list you'll see that this question is addressed many different times in many different ways. The problem is not that no one knows how to do routing, but rather that everyone has an opinion on how to do routing and it will be some time still before best practices emerge. Also, there's a lot of very cool tech being worked on that does things far beyond the original LN vision.
For example, onion routing allows payments to move through the network without anyone except the payer and payee knowing who was paid, in a way directly analogous to Tor. And like Tor hidden services, it is possible to send payments to a rendezvous address and have them forwarded on without even knowing the lightning node endpoint associated with the person you are paying!
There's a lot of cool tech being worked on and it just needs a little care and attention before going mainstream.

That was payment channels. Now the magic of LN is that multi-hop atomic transactions are possible: if Alice has a channel with Bob, and Bob has a channel with Carol, Alice can do these same speedy pay-by-the-minute transfers to Carol (so long as Bob is online to be routed through). This generalizes to longer and longer chains -- think "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon." That's the "network" part of LN -- all these payment channels form an interconnected payment graph that lets anyone pay anyone instantly, with only the setup and teardown of the channels needing to hit the chain.

No, it's exactly what I want to measure: how many people are running full nodes.

But in this case I'm interested in the number of people able to run a full node, so the metric is correct.


How about 500kb?
No joke. We are looking at what may well be the very end of bitcoin if things continue as they are currently progressing. Bitcoin isn't just better with decentralization, it is _pointless_ without it. You might as well just run federated servers at that point as you'd get faster block times and not be pumping millions of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere from mining.

Replace-by-fee and child-pays-for-parent need to be deployed as relay rules in Bitcoin Core as fast as these patches can be written / fixed up and reviewed. That could be only a matter of weeks or a month or two, well prior to hitting a hard limit. Once Bitcoin Core nodes are relaying updated transactions, wallet software needs to be updated to sign and if needed broadcast higher-fee replacement transactions when their transactions get stuck by low fees. In most cases this is really a trivially small amount of code -- you simply sign 5-6 copies of the tx with successively higher fees, and set a watchdog timer to broadcast replacements if the fee was too low. Likewise create child transactions claiming incoming coins that are too low in fees.
These changes alone make full blocks a non-issue. Once blocks are full a fee-market will develop, with rising fees to meet demand. Once this is adequately demonstrated, e.g. by stress test filling blocks and watching wallets replace transactions with higher fees, then raise the soft-cap from 750kB to the hard limit of 1MB.
In parallel with that, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and/or my own relative lock-time via sequence numbers and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY need to be deployed via soft-fork as soon as the BIP 66 v3 soft-fork is completed. This code is already written, and in the case of CLTV is already consensus-approved. These allow trustless setup of micropayment channels, which are already supported by Bitcoin Core and for which BitcoinJ (the library used by most wallets) already has API support. People like Strawpay and Blockstream are presently developing this technology.
Micropayment channels will provide fee relief. Full blocks will already not be an issue because the fee market, but micropayment channels with hub-and-spoke networks will allow continued use of low-fee bitcoin transactions.
This is all code that could get into Bitcoin Core by the end of this year, and be ready for use before the block size limit becomes a critical issue. It not only buys us time to implement and test better ideas for increasing the block size limit, but it also starts us on the path of being more efficient about our use of that precious resource, thereby allowing bitcoin to scale further for the same decentralization tradeoffs.

There's a lot of psychology to trading. As the price goes up there is demand to cash out for a variety of reasons. There's X bitcoin out there that wants to sell.. but any sophisticated trader would try to get their best value, even if they're past their sell-price. If you can get 5% better value but waiting when there's a clear pressure moving the price up, why not? Just trail the price with limit orders or something to make sure you cash out before the dip.
If you are doing this, and your limit orders are visible in the order book, a whale could choose to stop price movement by setting up a massive sell wall at a psychological limit (round number) above the current market price. If the price doesn't hit $20k, he doesn't have to sell a single coin (and as it is a bluff, he can cancel the order before the market reaches that price). But nobody else knows if that wall is real or not, and it does affect trading strategies causing the price to hold stable for a while, during which time risk-adverse people looking to cash out decide to stop waiting and do so, which he captures with limit orders much closer to the clearing price.
I should note that this strategy is illegal in most jurisdictions. But that doesn't stop HFT traders from doing it on regulated markets where they receive a slap on the wrist, much less on bitcoin markets where there is zero oversight.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:56:54

Filling a block with transactions, especially artificial transactions (random data), is an advantage to a large miner, especially one part of a cohort behind the great firewall. So long as you are part of a group with &gt;30% hashpower, maxing out the block size gives an advantage to you and a disadvantage to every other miner on the other side of the firewall.

I'm one of them. I believe it is inevitable that full RBF will be deployed, it's just a matter of how much economic loss we are willing to suffer before we finally all agree that zeroconf is not safe. I'd just rather avoid people being defrauded or losing freedoms along the way.
In is already the case that certain major payment processors are seeing unsustainable losses due to double spend fraud, and paying for it out of cash reserves. The particular company I am thinking of is also at the forefront of KYC compliance and investing in analytics (anti-fungibility) tech. I do not believe this to be a coincidence.
I fear what we might have to sacrifice at the alter of zeroconf.

Being efficient about legitimately updating a transaction can look like attempted fraud, because miners don't know the context. It won't be fraudulent, but it won't be provably not fraudulent either.
Full RBF allows wallets to be more efficient in how they construct replacement transactions. That is a really good thing if you care about how many transactions you can fit in a block.
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:40:23
When we have:
* deployed existing near- and medium-term solutions to deal with full blocks (e.g. replace-by-fee, child-pays-for-parent),
* deployed wallet support for trustless off-chain solutions, e.g. micropayment channels which require no consensus changes, or lightning network which does,
* deployed scaling improvements to make the software actually work reasonably well with larger blocks (e.g. fixing buffer bloat issues, probabilistic checking with fraud proofs), and
* a healthy fee market is established with fees representing a sizeable fraction of the miner revenue compared to subsidy (e.g. 3btc - 6btc).
Then we can revisit the issue. In the mean time I would like to see studies into:
* the effect block size has on block propagation, resource consumption, and other decentralization factors,
* other hard-fork changes that can provide better performance (e.g. Merkle tree tweaks and segregated witness), or alternative scaling tradeoffs (e.g. treechains).

I earnestly believe what I said. Bitcoin has potential to be more secure, more censorship-resistant than a properly selected group of functionaries. This was once the case, e.g. back in 2011/2012. With a lot of hard work and elbow grease, it could be the case again in the future.
But right now, *today*, I'd rather trust my sidechain peg pool to a group of properly selected functionaries over a merged mined SPV peg. By properly selected I mean high-reputation, security-conscious, perhaps competing or mutually distrusting organizations spread across multiple jurisdictions with legal contracts binding their behavior and insurance covering the peg pool.
Is that how I want things to be? No! I work on Bitcoin because I believe in the dream of fully decentralized, trustless solutions. But I must recognize reality when transaction selection is controlled by a handful of individuals in one jurisdiction who are on a first-name basis with each other.
In both cases it's a handful of legal entities that control the sidechain. With functionaries you pick the participants based on some criteria meant to minimize likelihood of collusion of regulatory interference. But in the merged mined case you merely end up with those who have the best business sense or political suave, geographically co-located for the most part. Which would you prefer?
It's a bit of a false choice because ideally we'd have *both*: require the peg transactions to both be SPV validated and signed off by a quorum of functionaries. We'll get there eventually (the code is there, but not in a generic form that works for any sidechain). But my point is more that it'll be a long time before I consider it safe or desirable to drop the federated peg signatures.
(This is my own view as a Bitcoin and sidechain developer, and does not necessarily represent my company or colleagues' views.)

Well to be fair it wasn't Wuille (or Maxwell or me) that came up with the soft-fork trick, it was Luke-Jr. Thanks Luke!
You'd be surprised how hard it can be to come up with the simplest stuff. Take a different example: BIP 34 puts the height in the coinbase string in order to make coinbase transactions guaranteed unique. Turns out there's a much more obvious place to put it which doesn't waste an extra 3 bytes of every block: the coinbase's nLockTime field. Duh. How many people were involved with BIP 34, the implementation, the review, and the rollout? Dozens of very smart people, at minimum. Yet it wasn't until at least a year later that someone pointed out:
somebody: Hey, uh, why didn't you use the nLockTime field for BIP 34?
every-core-dev-ever: ..... crap.
What can I say? This stuff is hard. I can't fault anyone for not seeing the soft-fork form of segwit, when I didn't see it either. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. But nevertheless we should welcome intellectual contributions from everyone: it is by expanding the pool of people looking, tinkering with, thinking about bitcoin, and sharing ideas that we are able to grow the number of ideas like this being generated.

The sprints are actually unrelated to the content of the workshop. It's just that if you have everybody in the same city for a few days, it makes sense to take some unstructured time to get work done with the efficiency gains of a face-to-face setting. E.g. at the last scaling bitcoin workshop there was a post-workshop day most of the developers were present for that was spent working on first drafts of mempool limiting code that has since been merged into bitcoin core.
@_date: 2015-06-15 23:24:45
I'm not counting just nodes with open ports. Those are important for the health of the network, but the metric I'm trying to capture is "people running Bitcoin Core." On a decentralized network every participant should be able to verify their own ledger state. Unfortunately this is also a much harder metric to measure because you can't connect to non-open nodes to verify their existence.
The number I quoted for 2013 is probably reliable, but the same technique used to measure it no longer works today because of some dope making bogus peer messages. But by some estimates it appears to be a small constant factor more than the number of reachable nodes. So maybe the number of nodes has dropped 10x or 15x instead of 20x. The point still stands: bitcoin is exponential user adoption, _and yet the number of full nodes has decreased by an order of magnitude_. Not "not enough new users are using full nodes" but "existing users are shutting of full nodes and they aren't being replaced."

If we actually stood to profit from Lightning, which we don't. We're very fortunate to have investors that encourage us to spend some portion of our time and their money on doing what is right for Bitcoin first and worry about how to make money from it second.
We spun up lightning development because in our conversations with clients and our counterparts in the industry we repeatedly were hailing the virtues of micropayment hub networks like lightning. Someone we respect said, essentially, "if you're so fond of lightning, and think not enough people are working on it, then why aren't you?" And they were right! So now we have a few people spending a significant portion of their time on it, and working to jump-start an industry-wide collaboration too.
We'll find some way to monetize our involvement in Lightning development, even if it just consulting and integration services a la IBM or Redhat, or reuse of the technology in other revenue-generating contexts. But Lightning itself, applied to Bitcoin as a means of achieving payment scalability, is something Blockstream is charitably working towards and does not affect our bottom line in any direct way I can think of.

Jeff, I've argued and still argue that we have insufficient information about the trade-offs being made or sufficient urgency to act at this time. We should not be raising the block size limit or scheduling a raise of the block size limit in 2015.
I don't want to put words in my colleagues mouths, but I believe Matt Corallo and Pieter Wuille have expressed similar sentiments as well. And although he has been quiet recently, Peter Todd has been arguing since 2013 against larger blocks.
There is not consensus that the block size limit needs to be raised, and especially not consensus that it needs to be done *right now* under the pressure of a hostile fork.

Why do you need to be large?
The currently pursued idea is that each lightning participant by default opens connections to 4 or so randomly selected other nodes (or more likely, chosen to minimize distance/fees to the majority of the graph rather than fully randomly).
As to the size of the channels, it just has to be on the order of the maximum amount of variance you expect in your cash flow. For example if I were to use Lightning for daily payments, I would expect to have about one month's expenditures across my various payment channels. If I were a business, I would expect to have the maximum amount of expected variance in accounts payable/accounts receivable locked up in channels.
That's not an enormous amount of money, and "locked up" is the wrong word to use.. the funds are fully accessible for lightning payments.
The "LN nodes require substantial capital" meme is a result of people assuming a hub-and-spoke model where there are these giant centralized hubs that everyone connects to. Those do require a lot of capital to run, which is a good thing because they would be generally bad for the ecosystem.

Yes, that topology requires three payment channels: A&lt;--&gt;B, B&lt;--&gt;C, and C&lt;--&gt;D. Lightning is a mechanism by which these three channels can be encumbered together with information regarding their role in the payment, such that the whole thing can settle off-blockchain in the ideal case.
Should channels be kept open a long time? It definitely helps. The idea is to have a very well connected network however, so if any one channel closes then it is very easy to route around it using some other path. So whether or not a channel remains open is really up to its participants and shouldn't affect the utility of the network as a whole in a noticeable way.

Both Lightning Network and SPV sidechains could be deployed on 1MB blocks, so long as some soft-fork changes are made to bitcoin or whatever the host chain is. However lightning still requires setup and teardown transactions per participant, and sidechains require peg transactions that really can get huge (10's of kilobytes minimum in a realistic scenario -- and that's _with_ anticipated efficiency improvements). Multiply out transaction size by the number of people opening and closing lightning channels or performing return pegs per day, and you very quickly get into the hundreds of megabytes per block if everyone in the world were using it.
But does that mean we need to scale to hundreds of megabytes per block now? No. We're still at least three orders of magnitude away from having 7 billion bitcoin users. And in any case, even though we all want bitcoin to scale to that much usage, we must make sure we do so in a way that preserves its decentralized nature or else we will have undone bitcoin entirely in the process.

You do realize that because Chinese miners represent &gt;50% of the mining hash rate the situation is reversed: western miners would need to rent VPS's in Shanghai or Beijing which they use to maintain competitiveness. And that this would result in putting all of bitcoin policy within the sphere of influence of a nation with no qualms about digital censorship and a history of corruption.
For policy to be neutral, the points of policy determination must be decentralized. Obviously the network issues would be adequately resolved by co-locating exit points for every pool in the same datacenter somewhere in the world. But then you would have centralized bitcoin policy to one location, and put at risk the only thing which makes bitcoin superior to alternative technology.

Reducing bandwidth for serving SPV clients, and increasing the security of SPV clients via fraud proofs, are very important aspects of scaling bitcoin.

They wouldn't see the transactions that did that unless they upgraded to the new code. The new code would fetch a different block that contained the theft transactions or 2nd subsidy-issuing coinbase. The original block would either only contain transactions spending coins that have not been moved over (or stolen), or in the more evil versions of the idea contains only the coinbase transaction with its commitments.
You can think of this as extension blocks with an additional soft-fork rule that the original 1MB-limit block have 0 non-coinbase transactions.

The new Lightning company will probably also have a large number of small, strategically useful investors in their seed round as well (guessing based on my experience in silicon valley, I have no knowledge). We are both in the same geographic location, and Silicon Valley is a very incestuous place... it is inevitable that at some point, probably soon, we will share investors, maybe without even knowing about it. Investors like to hedge their bets too.
But no we have not asked our investors to participate, nor have we constrained their ability to do so. We have not invested ourselves through some shell company, or anything like that. They are making their own way.

It's a known trade-off made by any presently deployable implementation of the 2-way peg. It's also something that we were very upfront about in the sidechains paper, and part of the reason why many of us are so concerned about decentralization of bitcoin mining.
In any non-SNARK, non-extension-block version of the 2-way peg a bitcoin node does not perform full validation of the sidechain as part of the consensus rules. Therefore it is perfectly possible (by design) for a threshold majority of the miners / signers to steal the coins in the peg pool, and censor any attempt to stop them. Why by design? Because that's the promise of sidechains: performant permissionless innovation at the cost of SPV trust in the honest majority of signers / miners.
Sidechains we are working on (e.g. Alpha, Liquid) and Rootstock, by the looks of it, make use of a fixed set of signers instead of or in addition to reliance on &gt;50% honest hashpower. This is because while less pure, it is ultimately safer to work with known, contracted entities as functionaries rather than 50% hashpower which at the moment is just a small handful of unaccountable people.
EDIT: Although obviously the ideal end goal is fully decentralized mining, where creating a 50% hashpower cabal requires organizing thousands of people at minimum. In such a case we may be able to consider a pure SPV peg to have a reasonable security model. But we're a long way from there yet...

The lightning network is essentially a caching layer for bitcoin. It allows you to make or facilitate payments and accumulate balances without hitting the chain until you need those coins for some external reason. This can be done safely because everyone at every point in time has transactions to settle their channels at present balances and receive their portion of the bitcoins backing it, including protective counter-transactions to use if someone tries to defraud you. Within lightning, coins that are yours never leave your control and are never given to 3rd parties for safekeeping.
Lightning protocol is large and complex, but most of the whitepaper deals with how you can perform these transactions in such a way that there is never a state where you will not end up being the sole possessor of your own coins should you choose to unilaterally exit, even though they are presently held in a 2-of-2 multi-sig or more complex hash-locked contracts. This is because in a failure case it may take time for the channels to unwind on the block chain and some fees are eaten up in the process, but you can be certain that the coins will get back to your exclusive control in short order, and coins you spent will end up in the hands of their present owners.

CryptoNight has pretty bad ASIC vulnerabilities unfortunately.  It is designed to minimize a metric that is supposed to track memory size and speed, but ends up failing because (1) unwarranted assumptions about memory type; and (2) not being cache-aware.  You can get a couple orders of magnitude advantage for CryptoNight in an ASIC by using off-the-shelf low-latency non-cached, non-registered memory used in big iron network routers, and dropping the cache line width for the custom CPU/FPGA/ASIC you put on top.  And that can be done with off-the-shelf parts (e.g. an existing ARM chip and commercially available memory on a simple PCB).
I think the idea of a proof-of-work algorithm that attempts to minimize the advantage of custom hardware over commodity GPUs that can be bought with cash with plausible deniability is good.  I just don't think many of the existing proposals are adequate, although Cuckoo Cycle is closest and is what will probably be used in Freicoin/Tradecraft, which is what this proposal is for.
I am also interested in whether we can make a proof-of-work algorithm that does interesting number-crunching for its inner loop, such as matrix triangularization.  Actual block-finding mining would have to be random problem instances of course, but that means any old / non-profitable ASICs could have reserve-duty service in top-500 supercomputers doing important climate modeling and quantum simulation tasks, and be a decentralization gain (since such reserve power could be used to block an attack).  This isn't a fully fleshed out idea yet, however.
Regarding block size, this approach only allows for the equivalent of 14.4GB blocks every 10 minutes before old clients' expectation of confirmation time diverges to infinity.  Technically you could support higher rates with graceful degradation of support for older clients.  But I don't think it would be a good idea.  14.4GB blocks  is way higher than could be supported in even the most distant foreseeable future without loss of decentralization.  (And with a flexible cap, I don't see getting anywhere near there before 2050 or beyond, where my predictive prowess stop.)

Eh.. to be absolutely clear Peter, it makes setup of a micropayment channel possible without any tx malleability issues. That's only one part of lightning. Full lightning also requires an ability to sign a transaction dependent on an unsigned transaction, and with a lock time relative to that unsigned (and therefore, unconfirmed) transaction.
But, baby steps. CLTV makes payment channels possible, and even hub-and-spoke payment networks. It's how we start, and we'll get the other features in time.

The selfish mining analysis shows that if you or your cabal consists of at least 30% of the hash rate, then the fact that the other miners don't hear about your block is to your advantage. Remember that you began building on your next block immediately and so you had a head start working on the _next_ block after the one that is being relayed. In the time it takes the other miners to find and relay their 2mb block, or to validate your 100mb block, you've been hashing away on the next one. The advantage this gives is so large that a mining cabal with 1/3 the hash rate is able to "51%" attack the network.
This was originally studied under the term "selfish mining" because it was imagined that miners would intentionally withold blocks to gain the selfish advantage. Later it was discovered that this need not be intentional -- it is the natural outcome even with honest miners stuck behind a bad network connection (e.g. the great firewall) or mining very large blocks. The miners with delayed blocks achieve the same selfish mining effect as a consequence of transmission and validation delays, even though this is just a consequence of the slow block validation and relay, not an intentional delay.

To elaborate, because of the discounting a 4MB block would be entirely witness -- one teeny tiny transaction and almost 4MB of witness. Obviously even in the extreme this doesn't represent normal bitcoin usage. With the kind of scripts we see on the network today, expected max block sizes would be on the order of about 1.8MB. With heavy multi-sig usage, or key trees and other scripts with large witness, somewhere on the order 3MB might be a practical upper limit. But a miner purposefully creating the largest possible block is limited to 4MB, and that's what Pieter and Greg mean by "worst-case 4MB".

We don't know that. We know that there are many reports of people turning off full nodes due to resource usage and sync times. SPV wallets have a use, but there are also cases where full nodes absolutely should be used but people are using SPV wallets instead, or worse centralized web services.
The important point is that we are seeing an exponential increase in bitcoin adoption, yet we are seeing an exponential _decrease_ in the number of full nodes operating. If what you say is correct then one should expect the number of full nodes to not be increasing at the same rate as SPV nodes. E.g. a relative decline percentage-wise, but still a growing number. However the actual situation is far worse than that: the absolute number of full nodes is dropping despite rapidly expanding usage of bitcoin. That should be very, very alarming.

No, this is certainly not correct. "Fiat" means "by decree." Dollars ultimately have value because of the notion of legal tender -- the US government's policy across all branches of accepting such paper bills as payment for debt.
The specific value of the dollar relative to other goods and services or commodities is set by the market. But the reason dollars have value \*AT ALL\* is because the government says it does, by decree or "fiat" if you will.
No one organization or federation makes bitcoin have value because they decree it too. Bitcoin is not "by fiat" currency.

No. There are no sidechain "assets" to distribute. The sidechain starts with an empty monetary base -- no coins allocated at all. Then people transfer bitcoin from mainchain into the sidechain, claiming an equal number of coins. Independently, people can transfer sidechain coins back out to bitcoin if they so desire, again getting precisely the same number of coins from the pool of coins that were frozen from the transfer in.

Soft-fork means things which were previously OK are illegal under the new validation rules. Blocks permitted are a strict subset of those previously allowed. This means old clients continue to function just fine for all except mining purposes. All that is required is that &gt;51% of the hash power upgrade, although &gt;90% would be preferred. P2SH is an example of a successful soft-fork.
A hard-fork allows blocks which were previously invalid, and therefore older clients will _not_ be guaranteed to continue working. This requires every node on the network to upgrade. This has never been purposefully done, but increasing the block size would be an example.

Peter, in general coin history is exponential. If a transaction has multiple inputs, you need to validate each of those histories. O(n) is a little misleading when n itself is the exponential term. How do you prevent the problem that a globally interconnected economy means that coins get throughly mixed and you quickly end up with individual coins' histories being dependent on nearly the entire block chain history?

Yes, you do. You simply mine off your prior blocks and ignore others, effectively soft-forking the network to only accept blocks signed by you.

A side chain is a merged mined alt chain which differs from bitcoin in some technical way, but supports a sufficient subset of bitcoin necessary to perform 2-way pegging operations. You can suspend bitcoins on the bitcoin mainnet chain and receive peg-coins on the side chain, which you can then use in whatever innovative feature the side chain supports. Later whoever now holds the peg-coins can turn them back into bitcoins on mainnet. It enables permissionless innovation because anyone can create these side chains and anyone is able to freely move value between them.

* Bid/ask are all posted on chain, with the market rules made part of the consensus code, when they could just as easily be matched off-chain (deterministic matching is not required) and the consensus rules kept simple.
* Transitive trust transactions do not seem to be supported (?)
* Fragmented asset issuance with the sub-chain concept. There should be no limit to the number of assets that can be issued on a single chain. It’s just because of the stupid on-chain markets that they were force to fragment infrastructure in this way.
* Limited, special purpose scripting capability for output redemption when we should be extending and generalizing bitcoin script.
* The DAC stuff (unclear if this replaces the limited output redemption script) is based on javascript as far as I can tell. If they think they can shoehorn a javascript interpreter into the consensus code, they're in for some surprises.
* Different proof of work scheme - this provides negative long-term utility.

Interesting that you lump Jorge and myself, co-creators of one of the earliest altcoin proposals, Freicoin, of being in the "kill all altcoins" camp. That couldn't be further from the truth!
During the 80-byte OP_RETURN snafu earlier this year I took it upon myself the convince XCP to abandon its embedded consensus approach and native currency in favor of a merged mined sidechain, arguing on technical points. Sadly, though unsurprisingly I was not successful. I have used the words parasitic consensus in these conversations, but that phrase has technical not derrogatory meaning. I feel sad for the counterparty project, which I feel made poor decisions early under bad counsel, and are now unwilling or unable to back out.
Ethereum I have also been critical of on both technical and organizational grounds. I am not a fan of the issuance pre-sale funding model, which I feel sets up bad incentives and exploits the present lack of sophistication among bitcoin crowdfund investors who can't be expected to have access to domain knowledge to judge claims being made. But I don't think I've ever used harsh words, much less called them a scam, which they certainly are not.
I am a fan of altcoins. I think there is room for innovation in the space of currency design. I have done this in the past with Freicoin, the first demurrage cryptocurrency whose exponential decay mechanism required consensus rules that were actually quite tricky to work out. I would like to see more innovation in the area of mutual credit currencies, like the original ripple concept, global basket currencies in the spirit of Bernard Lietaer's terra, and more adoption from community currency groups. If you have an idea for an altcoin with a new economic basis, I'd like to hear it.
But if the complaint is that I'm against clonecoins with no significantly distinguishing features from bitcoin or other existing coins then... Guilty as charged.

A side chain is just any merged mined chain which supports 2-way pegging. Since pegging isn't fully implemented yet, it is true but rather trivial to say that it doesn't exist. However potentially any useful alt, e.g. namecoin or freicoin could be a side chain.

I had some ideas for that in the past, using proof-of-stake voting to determine budgetary requirements for distributing the freicoin subsidy. The proposal was called "republicoin" although sadly there is an altcoin now with that name so doing a google search is not as easy as it once was. It was discussed on the Freicoin forums.
Republicoin however isn't a finished design as it requires an efficient uncensorable voting scheme where the miners are unable to affect the outcome of the vote. While not proven to be impossible, this is a very difficult constraint. It remains an open problem to solve.
Basic income is a whole 'nother problem which I don't see how to solve via distributed consensus.

Wow, such fanboyism. Let's set the record straight: there was originally no XRP in Ripple, nor any need for XRP. The whole point of ripple is the issuance of IOUs and depository-backed assets, and the atomic swap of these credit-based currencies. The natural thing to do is to pay fees in the issued assets being traded, especially with the availability of multi-hop atomic swap at the heart of the ripple protocol allowing you to exchange these fees into whatever asset you want to hold. And indeed, this is exactly what ripple did prior to OpenCoin/Ripple Labs buying the trademarks from Ryan Fugger.
There is absolutely no reason but greed for XRP to exist.

No, it is *exactly* the kind of scummy issuance model we are trying to get rid of with side chains. In Peter R's proposal you issue coins to the current hodlers of bitcoin, most of which probably don't care about the new alt. So they offload their coins to turn a profit, and those are picked up by early adopters of the alt. Later, the alt floats against bitcoin and people speculate on it as an independent asset. If it does well, people who move bitcoin in then must do so by finding buyers and paying the premium. *That is rent collection*. It hurts the economy and weakens the crypto currency ecosystem. Why would you want that?
Side chains allow you to use *bitcoin* outside of the bitcoin block chain. What you are advoating is just another alt. It has absolutely nothing to do with side chains and pegging mechanisms whatsoever, so please go away and stop spamming these threads.

Of course, now there are better options.
@_date: 2014-10-25 06:57:44
It's a convertibility peg. At any time you can take bitcoins and turn them into an equal number of sidecoins, or vice versa.
Now a valuation peg naturally arises out of that. Even though at a technical level the bitcoins and sidecoins are different assets on different chains, it is expected that they would be valued the same because any difference would be arbitraged away.
Of course it's a bit like the old story of an economist who is walking with a friend, and the friend points, "Look, there's a $20 bill on the ground!" "Can't be," says the economist, "If there was a $20 bill on the ground, somebody would have already picked it up."
There's nothing at the technical, protocol level which says bitcoins and sidecoins have to be valued the same. But because the mechanism for exchanging one for the other is trustless and accessible to anyone, any difference in valuation is like money left on the ground. Someone will pick it up, equalizing supply and demand and nullifying any difference in price.

There are some outstanding problems, however. It's not immediately obvious how to deploy this on top of a proof-of-work consensus system without giving miners the ability to collude to censor votes and rig elections.

This is incorrect, although out of scope for the paper so we didn't adequately cover it. There are other mechanisms for making sure that owners of hashing equipment are able to choose which sidechains to support, and who does the validation and transaction selection.


I think you misunderstand how demurrage would work. Demurrage would be a property of the sidechain itself, not set by some committe or even the miners. See for example how demurrage is implemented in Freicoin.
Anyway it's probably not worth spending extra time debating this as demurrage or inflation + peg price adjustment are only two options out of many, and absolutely not a requirement to deploying sidechains.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:30:24
There are various schemes to solve that, my own biased favorite being to have demurrage and a perpetual reward (in effect, redistributing the pegged coins to miners by enough to provide sufficient security). There are other options being explored by the team as well.
Note that is possible to mitigate a wide range of merged mining attacks by disabling features on the side chain (including return pegs) if the merged mined hash rate drops below some threshold.

Do not trust bc.i for things you can verify yourself:
Your addresses decode to 38 bytes. Valid address formats are 25 bytes of data (1 version byte, 20 hash bytes, 4 checksum bytes).
Given that your "addresses" encode 33 bytes outside of the version field and checksum, I thought you might have encoded a public key as the payload instead of a 20-byte pubkey hash, but it doesn't seem to be a valid pubkey either.
It's bc.i's mistake that they are accepting these examples as valid bitcoin addresses.

Alex, there are various things which could be done to help mitigate this problem.
First, bitcoin itself could be soft-forked to require revelation of the merged mining hash tree as a validation or network propagation rule. Then an attacker could no longer do his attack in secret "for free" as he would be giving up bitcoin and other rewards.
Second, operating a side chain when the network hash rate is less than 50% of bitcoin's is not safe in general, and it could be possible to disable features of the chain if/when such a drop occurs.
Thirdly, it might be possible to construct some sort of fee-based incentive system that keeps miners from cooperating with a attack. There are a wide variety of options for this and we'd certainly like to hear other people's opinions too.
Fourth, the ability for a mining pool to attack a side chain in secret is a failure of the current mining model. It could be fixed by having users or user-selected agencies take over transaction and sub-chain header selection.
@_date: 2014-10-24 21:54:15
On my phone so it is hard to type a long, detailed response, but sidechains do not require merged mining. It is an independent choice to be made with plusses and minuses for each. Additionally there are ways to strengthen the peg pool against attack, each with their own tradeoffs.

By "watch the twig" you mean do full-node validation of that branch of the treechain (which, btw, won't subdivide down to the level of individual addresses). That is most definately not the same thing as SPV mode. But it doesn't even stand up to analysis. How do you know a transaction sending to your twig is valid? By checking its intputs. But how do you know the inputs are valid? By validating the whole history of *those* branches. Very quickly you get to the point where you have to watch the whole block chain to know whether an incoming coins history is valid or not. This is not a mechanism for scaling.

@_date: 2014-05-26 17:19:03
That sortof described everything surrounding open transactions, but not open-transactions itself ;)
Open-transactions *is* a centralized client-server accounting ledger, except that requested operations must be cryptographically signed, the server is unable to forge transactions (because it lacks the private keys), and receipts state are audited by the clients to make sure the server doesn't cheat/rewrite history. In other words, all the server is trusted to do is timestamp events and otherwise has no control over client balances other than denial of service (censoring transactions). The scalability comes from the centralization -- it's very easy to scale up a single server.

What if everyone prunes? What is my incentive for running one when I get higher costs and no tangible benefit from it? This is classic tragedy of the commons. Even if there are archival nodes, what if you just can't find one to connect to at the time that you need it?
The truth is that pruning is an expert-only feature pretty much only usable by an organization which maintains many full nodes (but only needs a small number of archive nodes). Unless you have an archival node nearby and under your control / influence, the risks and externalized costs are far too great.

@_date: 2014-11-07 02:45:09
Regarding the history point, I find that a bit disingenuous. The issuer is not in all circumstances already trusted with having an online, or easily assessable key for refreshing coin histories. I may trust the issuer to honor redemption of my token, all things being equal, but I may not trust their key management for the issuance. Having a key for continuous re-issuance should be an opt-in, not practical default. And that's without getting into the use cases which don't involve an obvious candidate to act as issuer, beyond the initial issuance.
Such a scheme also introduces all sorts of weak points, such as regulatory pressure on the issuer causing de-facto changes in the contract governing the token, e.g. by requiring KYC identification, due to the fact that the issuer needs to be involved in cleaning up histories. Higher-level protocol limits may cause coins to become effectively worthless to people who don't wish to comply with the new rules, as the history grows so large as to reach these limits.
Finally, I'm concerned about any strategy whose implementation path of least resistance does not meet the security design requirements. You say "this can be done entirely offline on a secure machine and easily audited by multiple parties", but in reality we both know that most people won't bother with real security, and a frighteningly large number of people will keep issuance keys online on an insecure device like their phone. No, I much prefer a model where the default security in the face of dumb or under-informed users matches at least an acceptable basic level of security.

These gateway issuers would operate much like the way exchange traded currency funds do: anyone can wire funds into their bank account (in multiples of some minimum amount, say $50,000) and they receive crypto tokens. Likewise anyone can provide an equivalent amount of crypto tokens and request a wire transfer out. They use wire transfers to limit the damage which can be done by charge backs.
An ethical gateway would maintain publicly viewable bank statements showing how much cash they have at hand in accounts earmarked for client funds, which should match the number of crypto tokens availble, which anyone can audit.
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:34:50
Except.. that's not true. And I'm not even sure how to explain because I don't know how you came to that conclusion.
P2pool outputs are in the coinbase transaction. The coinbase doesn't pay fees. When you spend an output, the size of the transaction you are spending from doesn't matter, and doesn't affect fees in any way.

If you have &gt;50% of the hashrate, you will eventually overtake the honest chain no matter how far back you rewind history. It's just a matter of time so long as you maintain that hash rate, which for a pool is merely a cash flow issue since once they do overtake the chain they get all those subsidies too.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:35:54
He should know better, IMHO. Pruning has a very specific, narrow technical meaning in the context of bitcoin, which he was using correctly: the ability for a full node to forget data under the provably-correct condition that it *personally* will never need that data again under nominal conditions. However this is not a very safe thing to do! As I said in the post above, you still need that data if you ever get a corrupted database or otherwise have to reindex, and the data must remain available on the network somewhere for new nodes to be able to come online. Which is why pruning has not yet been implemented in the reference client.
Among developers talking to each other, we speak of provably prune-able outputs and know the limitations of such, but for a press release I'd much use some other language which makes clear the externalized costs still incurred by the network.

This is a commonly repeated falsehood. With treechains you have to sync the entire history of the coins you recieve, which explodes exponentially and very quickly becomes a requirement to fetch nearly the entire block chain history. Treechains *give up* the capability to do transactions without syncing and validating the entire block chain, what we call SPV mode.

Sidecoins are like casino chips. You bring in some currency and exchange them 1:1 for an equivalent number of chips. You then use the chips for things you can't do with regular currency, and when you're done you cash out your current holdings back their original form (bitcoins).
What's awesome is that these chips and the consinos where you use them (the side chains) can have all sorts of new functionality, things you can't currently do with bitcoin. E.g. issued assets and advanced smart property contracts, or Zerocash-like anonymity. The peg mechanism allows you to use your bitcoins to create side-chain currency which you then use with the new features, and safely convert back to bitcoin at the end of the day.

I think I understand what you're saying. But the point I'm trying to make is that e.g. even though bitcoin is not 100% trustless, the trust you are required to have lies in the decentralization of mining and the rationality of the economic majority for example, *not* the developers directly. So too do we want it to be with Blockstream: each product we release will require some minimal trust, just as bitcoin itself does, but we will not be costodians of that trust.
@_date: 2014-10-25 00:27:34
Prices are sticky, and economic information does not propagate instantaneously. In an economy using an inflatable currency for pricing -- like fiat, for example -- those which are close to the inflation mechanism get more benefit from the new currency than those further down the line. Those furthest removed from the source of inflation get hit the worst. You can see this in national and regional economies for example, where consumer price inflation lags behind injections of money by years. Investment banks make their profit from quantitative easing long before prices spike, and greeters at Wal-Mart don't see a pay raise until after.
With demurrage, balances are immediately adjusted by expected future inflationary effect, resulting in a proportionally equal effect felt by all participants, which is what the line you quoted was trying to say.
Regarding the recycling / diminishing value of old coins, yes inflation has this property as well (modulo the above point about delayed effect). Sorry this was probably phrased poorly as the comment was meant to be contrasting with deflationary bitcoin, not a hypothetical inflationary altcoin.

Non-outsourceable puzzles have just a few minor issues... like the fact that it requires 100,000 cpu cores computing in parallel to calculate the zero-knowledge proof within the bounds of a 10 minute block interval, the proof computation makes the mining process non-progress-free, it's not obvious there are mechanisms to eliminate variance, there's the issue of trusted setup of the CRS security parameters (meaning, btw, that someone with the secret setup parameters can mint blocks on demand), and watermarking makes it trivially easy for mining pools to identify which users defected, thereby defeating the whole purpose.
Treechains are more of a concept than a working idea at this stage, but one thing is for certain: the basic core of the idea is giving up SPV mode. So say goodbye to every mobile wallet, and even the vast majority of desktop and server applications. Not to mention all future extensions which rely on full validation, such as committed UTXO indices, or any application whose performance characteristics preclude the operation of a full node.

Right.

Absolutely correct. 0x7fffffff bytes would be my suggestion, or a few bits smaller if exhausting memory on a 32-bit machine is a concern. Realistically 128MB, 256MB or 512MB are good choices for a hard upper limit. What we should not do is make hard-forking to increase the block size a regular thing.
Note that _I am against raising the block size at this point in time_. Even 2MB might break the code and infrastructure right now. But in a year or so, maybe.

I love Greg, but I think he is half-wrong in this instance, because of an overload of the word 'share'. In p2pool share difficulty is both the cutoff for reporting to the p2pool node for stats purposes (which does vary dynamically according to the miner's hardware and needs), and the minimum difficulty required to enter into the share chain and receive a portion of the mining rewards over the next 3 days. Unless things have significantly changed in the last year since I did some p2pool hacking, this latter value is network-adjusted and not dynamically configurable.

We are individuals and don't always speak with the same voice, but it should not be surprising that we hold common views with respect to bitcoin and blockchain design. It is because no other organization shared these principles that we felt compelled to start our own company.
In my own case, OP_RETURN has a definite use case, specifically stealth address payments, which justifies its inclusion in the is-standard rules. However to date there has been no application which justifies inclusion of more than a single 256 bit number (32 bytes), plus maybe -- maybe -- 8 bytes of identifying data.
It is my own opinion that the is-standard rules should not permit relay of transactions which provably are constructed in a space-wasting way, as any transaction using more than 40 bytes of data is. That was my opinion before Blockstream, and hasn't changed.

First, great work Andrew Miller et al. This is valuable research that pushes the state of the art forward. We arrive at workable solutions though a succession of unworkable prototypes. Like this one.
So before anyone goes crazy demanding that bitcoin developers implement this, or start conspiracy theories for why we have not, we need a reality check: non-outsourceable puzzles have just a few minor issues... like the fact that it requires 100,000 cpu cores computing in parallel to calculate the zero-knowledge proof within the bounds of a 10 minute block interval, the proof computation makes the mining process non-progress-free, it's not obvious there are mechanisms to eliminate variance, there's the issue of trusted setup of the CRS security parameters (meaning, btw, that someone with the secret setup parameters could mint blocks on demand), and watermarking makes it trivially easy for mining pools to identify which users defected, thereby defeating the whole purpose.
So.. still some work left to be done.

$GBTC is not an ETF. It is not even anything resembling an ETF. It is in fact quite deceptive how it is structured and marketed, as it has people like you thinking it is an ETF.
$GBTC is a way to buy and sell a share of ownership of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a fund that itself holds bitcoin. However -- this is a critical point -- you can never actually redeem shares of $GBTC for bitcoin. It's a one-way street. An accredited investor buys bitcoin via BIT, waits a year, and then is allowed to convert those shares of BIT (a private fund) into shares of $GBTC (an over the counter tradable security). There's no way to go in the reverse directions.
This is why as an asset $GBTC does a pretty terrible job of tracking the bitcoin price. It is constantly out of sync as supply and demand for $GBTC does not match supply and demand for bitcoin itself. A lot of people, myself included, don't want to pay a premium for holding bitcoin via $GBTC and are hoping to see a real ETF instrument that does track net asset value to within a few basis points of reality.

They are entirely different things, like peanut butter and jelly, that happen to go really well together.
Segwit has nothing to do with lightning directly, but two of the very useful things it does is fix malleability and put values under the signature.
Lightning doesn't require segwit at all, but value-under-signature makes the protocol much more efficient, and fixing malleability enables the desirable modes of operation where you outsource channel watching. But you _could_ do lightning without segwit, it is not a strict requirement.

To prevent a lot of instant inflation and sudden spike in fee rates from small blocks there'd be a lower cap at 1MB -- you don't get a discount for selecting a smaller-than-1MB block. In order to get a discount you must first grow the block size, and you do that by delaying subsidy (making a larger block with higher difficulty). It is true that later miners could choose to make smaller blocks and get more subsidy, but effectively they are claiming the subsidy you left on the table earlier.
This proposal actually _delays_ issuance if you expect the block size to grow at all.

EDIT: This was a response to your question before you edited your comment to answer yourself. Hopefully someone still finds it helpful:
Short of central banks themselves moving into this space and issuing crypto assets with the backing of their governments -- interestingly Canada is moving in this direction with Mint Chip -- there is little else that you can do.
If a gateway is operated in the way I describe, the gateway's accounts would have been auditable in a way that MtGox wasn't, and indeed it's not hard to imagine ways in which consumer protection could be extended. Given that most of the risk is eliminated in this setup, it's possible that the gateway could aquire private depositor insurance, or get itself regulated as a bank and take advantage of public programs (e.g. FDIC).
Also, if setup correctly it becomes impossible for the gateway to gamble away client funds except in such a way that would be grounds for criminal negligence or fraud. Unless depositor insurance was available those funds would still be lost, but there'd be a clear audit trail to find out where they went, and legal recourse to recovering some of them, perhaps.
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:48:21
No it is definitely stored in the transaction, or at least the witness portion of it if we are assuming segwit. It is required data in order for a full node to validate the block, as otherwise you'd be able to make "negative" outputs and print money. However, as with the signatures, once it is validated you can throw it away, so it doesn't need to be served to SPV clients, and conceivably there could be a pruned operating mode where it is kept separately and removed after it is no longer needed for synchronizing other peers.
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:18:39
Enforcing a soft-fork is something that requires &gt;50% of the hashpower. The mechanism I described is something permission-less that miners do when they create a block. Effectively they "vote" on the block size limit by making a bigger block (at cost to subsidy), or a smaller block (adds to subsidy). They don't need to coordinate to do that.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:06:31
In this model there is a separation between the gateway where fiat and other external assets are converted into crypto tokens, and the exchange where these crypto assets are traded.
The exchange runs over the p2p network and the block chain, and it cannot be shut down.
The tokens issued by the gateway are crypto assets that also held in your wallet, with balances that cannot be manipulated or seized.
Redemption requires some level of trust in the issuer / gateway remaining solvent. However as I mentioned in the OP, there are some cryptographic assurances that you can have. As shown by gmaxwell/nullc, you can do zero knowledge proofs of summation of user balances to get clear knowledge about their liabilities, and they can publish bank statements to show that they have enough assets to cover a bank run.

It's not pruneable. Any data included in a block must be transmitted, stored, and validated by every full node doing initial synchronization from now until the heat death of the universe. What's more, this cost is fully externalized and not paid for in the slightest. Once a full node processes the data it can safely forget it ... so long as it never has to reindex, and is unconcerned with the long-term health of the network.
Storing any kind of non-transactional data on the block chain is bad. Very bad. Using OP_RETURN to store a single hash is just the least bad option out there.

The 2016-block difficulty adjustment algorithm would have to be modified so as undo whatever bias is added by per-block miner adjustments. So if every single block was mined at 75% block size with an average interblock time of 7.5 minutes, at the end of the adjustment period (using the setup from the OP) the max block size would be decreased by 25%, but the default target difficulty would remain the same, as it took 75% time to do a 75% work block.
And yes as you worked out and I mention in the email, this only works while subsidy exists and is a significant component of the block reward. But that is most likely the case for the next decade.

Upon reflection I suspect this might have been a scammer trying to get claims from people not paying attention to the slight of hand, and then flip it to an actual hedge fund at closer to the real valuation.

Death of clonecoins is a phrasing I would have preferred.
Note that this "death of" marketing is a meme that was not created by us, not endorsed by us, and does not reflect our views. Back in April Adam Back did a *Let's talk Bitcoin!* episode called "Sidechain Innovation" where he explained Greg Maxwell's (nullc) two-way peg and the potential for sidechains. Reddit user CP70, who as far as I can tell is neither associated with Blockstream nor Let's talk Bitcoin!, linked to the episode and changed the title to "Sidechains: the coming death of altcoins and ethereum." Sadly we were busy on travel and in meetings at the time and did not make effort to sufficiently distance ourselves from that editorializing.
As to what we have actually said on the topic, note that the sidechain whitepaper calls out innovation in altcoins as a proposed application of sidechains. We propose that altcoins implement two-way peg mechanisms so that they can benefit from remaining connected to the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. That's hardly calling for the death of altcoins!

No, miners are not, and repeating the claim doesn't make it true. Take your own example of the block size -- the miners could decide to mine on increased block sizes any day they want, but anyone running bitcoind would ignore their blocks and blacklist peers that relay them. The only way to push out a hard fork change is to have _everybody_ adopt it, and the impetus for that changeover is when the "economic majority" commit to the new fork. Miners are not any more significant a subgroup of the economic majority than any other group.
What would happen if the hard fork didn't have miner support? It would continue on with whatever hash power it does have -- just like any of the countless altcoins that lack significant miner support.

*a safe upper limit is no higher than 4MB.
4MB may in fact not be safe. The research didn't consider all issues that arise in raising the block size, but in the subset it did consider problems occurred above 4MB. There might also be other issues not identified by those authors that emerge between 2MB - 4MB.
This is a reason why it is conservatively safe to raise the block size slowly over time in the way the segwit does, before considering changes that would make &gt;2MB blocks common.

There really hasn't been. The only thing that comes close is the 2013 probabilistic network split, but even that is in its own quasi-fork class more closely resembling a soft-fork than a hard-fork.

I'm not a core developer, I can't speak for Bitcoin Core, etc. etc. But I do spend all day most days hanging out around many of them online and in person. I don't think anyone is taking a "my way or the highway!" position. Rather the situation is this: in the 14 months since segwit was proposed, not a single objection on technical grounds has stood up to scrutiny. Furthermore, segwit provides exactly what was asked for at the time: an effective 2MB block size increase (in addition to many other objectively beneficial improvements). If this can't pass, what will?
Most importantly of all, the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin is its independence from, and isolation against political meddling. Forcing a political compromise to a contentious issue is a _failure mode_ of bitcoin, not a successful outcome. Most developers I think would argue that the consensus rules remaining unchanged -- "no progress" -- would be a better outcome than any controversial resolution. At least then bitcoin would be left with its core value proposition intact.
If someone stood up a legit, data-based technical objection that stands up to review, the story would be different. But that hasn't happened.

How so?
In any case we should avoid coercive outcomes. Rather than use force to block one chain, we should be making sure social consensus on the best path forward prevents more than one from getting any traction. I'm more worried about the precedent set by a coercive hard fork rollout than the risk of chain split when there is already strong consensus in favor of a change.

Respectfully, I don't think you are approaching this right. I say this because I don't want you to needlessly waste your time or get burned out.
Getting "important people" together into a meeting is not the way bitcoin protocol can or should be changed. And for what it's worth, this has already happened a dozen different times without a solution -- both in the public (Scaling Bitcoin) and in private (various roundtables).
The issues here are fundamental -- there is not a scaling solution for bitcoin, much less one that everyone would be happy with. The requirements and acceptable limits for people on all sides of the debate do not have an overlapping area of acceptable solutions. On one side you have growth maximalists who want every transaction on the chain, at least for the foreseeable future and will require regular doublings of the block size as limits are hit. On the other extreme you have the decentralization maximalists that see room for no more than a constant factor increase and want blocks to be full so that settlement-layer technology (payment channels and fee markets) can be tested. These are polar opposite, incompatible views.
Side note: as a matter of good policy, if you are going to engage in debate on your IRC channel, please make sure it is logged and logs are made available on a public archive.

Every residential Comcast/Xfinity customer in the US has a 1TB monthly cap, beyond which they are charged $30/50GB (yes, it's highway robbery). With 8MB blocks, in only two years it will take the entire monthly data allotment to do an initial block download. Anything over 10MB would exhaust that limit just to keep up on a monthly basis, assuming perfect efficiency in the p2p layer (so 4-5MB more realistically).
Yes, the US has surprisingly shitty internet for a 1st world country, although it is not alone (check out Australia). But I assure you access in large swaths of Africa, South America, the Middle East, and Central Asia are not any better.

At a huuuuge waste of engineering talent and massive delays. I personally doubt it would happen. Payment channels have been possible since the invention of bitcoin, and known about almost as long. Yet how many payment channel software do you use on a daily basis? Oh right, none. Fixing malleability makes the situation waaay better, so much better that it seems actually reasonable to use LN in that case.
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:14:49
Do you mean to ask when will bitcoin's on-chain transaction volume match visa's?
Never. It is impossible for a global broadcast system to match a centralized system. The only way this could become literally true is if people stopped using visa.
That's why off-chain scaling solutions are interesting -- they are the only things which provide for the possibility of reaching that level of scalability.

It's not rare if a miner is colluding on the attack. (And, btw, it's not rare at all -- there are nodes on the network which do nothing but malleate transactions they receive and relay to miners. If you are connected to one of these nodes, you can be sure that the miners will receive the malleated transaction first.)

Let's say the miners decide they don't like this subsidy-halving thing, so they're going to reinstate 50BTC subsidy per block, forever. They allocate a BIP9 bit, roll out a set of patches to bitcoind to make the change, and start signalling support. 95% threshold is reached, and it activates.
Should we all just go along because obviously the vote passed? Do you, a non-mining user feel a little disenfranchised?
There are basically two problems with calling BIP9 support signalling 'voting', one derived partially from the other:
(1) BIP9 rollout does not resemble voting as we mean in in the democratic sense today. It is not one user, one vote. I would say that votes are weighted by hashpower, but even that is not really true -- pools often don't own the hashers that find the blocks they produce. There's this weird backroom dealing that underlies it all, not a verifiable electoral system.
(2) The developers of BIP9 _knew_ this, and so they purposefully framed the system as not being a voting framework. The idea is that some unspecified method is used to gauge whether there is widespread technical consensus for a proposal, at which point a BIP9 bit is allocated and assigned by the developers. The miners then wait until they feel it is safe to activate, a determination left to their best judgement, and then signal their readiness, and the feature activates when 95% of the hashpower has indicated readiness. Thus the intent is that setting the BIP9 bit indicates not "I think this is a good idea" but "In my best judgement, it is now safe to activate."

So you're drawing arbitrary lines in the sand and adjusting as technology develops.
However take into consideration that in 2010 the network couldn't have handled 1MB blocks. It would have literally not been possible for the bitcoin client to function at that capacity, and mining if it still existed at all would have been entirely centralized in whatever the largest hashpower entity was at the time (probably either ArtFortz's proto-GPU miners or some sort of botnet mining on DeepBit). If we selected performance-based metrics then we would have had limits on the order of say 100kB or so and probably would still be well under 1MB today.
The problem is performance of Bitcoin exists on an S curve, not a smooth exponential. There was a long period of slow development. Then there was a period of massive real capacity increases from 2012-2016 as various scaling bottlenecks were removed through careful software engineering. Now we exist at the tail end of that curve where after the next couple of improvements we'll have run out of major things to do, and further advances will only be a few percentage points per year.
"Up to the market" is an applause light for libertarians, just like "it should be democratically decided" is for liberals. The reality is that how you setup and measure the market determines to a large extent what the outcome would be. So there are still choices to be made here.
My own preference is that we use some variant of the "flexcap" to let the market decide. But this requires a lot of preparatory work and a more robust fee market than we have now. It's Step 9 on a 9 step plan, and we're still fiddling around on steps 2 &amp; 3.

Brian, you can start by providing the data-driven analysis that shows 2MB max block size with segwit has acceptable centralization tradeoffs. Hard, empirically verifiable numbers would be preferred, with real word test setups utilizing actual internet connections in the areas where industrial scale mining currently happens. After that it'd be nice to have an empirically determined extrapolation of centralization pressure given trending technology and physical process limits to justify future growth.
This shouldn't be a problem because as you say we all agree this is safe, so I presume that you based your decision on having done the analyais and have these numbers available.

No, CLV allows you to put a transaction on the chain that can't be spent until some block time or height in the future.

Why would larger blocks have a higher orphan risk? What is the connection of block size to orphan risk at all, so long as SPV mining exists?
When a block is found by a pool, the worker submits the share consisting of just the block header, coinbase, and merkle path. Effectively constant size regardless of block size. The pool then immediately issues new work to all of its hashers, some of which are other pools who also immediately update their own hashers. Everyone switches to mining on top of the new block before it has even been transmitted anywhere. As long as the block eventually arrives in the next 30s - 2min (depending on pool configuration), they keep mining on the new block and there's no difference in orphan risk.
@_date: 2016-03-04 22:35:52

@_date: 2015-05-28 16:39:08
The lightning network is essentially a caching layer for bitcoin. It allows you to make or facilitate payments and accumulate balances without hitting the chain until you need those coins for some external reason. This can be done safely because everyone at every point in time has transactions to settle their channels at present balances and receive their portion of the bitcoins backing it, including protective counter-transactions to use if someone tries to defraud you.
@_date: 2015-01-28 13:25:02
It is unlikely that malleability will be fixed entirely any time soon. And if it were, the current approach is whack-a-mole, and only really works on standard transaction formats. There are also very interesting and useful transactions which can never, ever be made malleability-safe.

There's no need for a block chain there, and in fact the block chain makes things worse.
@_date: 2017-02-05 23:12:36
No, neither the chain nor the network splits. That's the reason for the supermajority activation threshold. The segwit blocks are backwards compatible with non upgraded nodes. That cannot be the case in a hard fork however.
There have not been hard forks in the past. Not in the way that is being advocated here.

@_date: 2017-02-03 23:11:58
Unfortunately the massive reduction in chain size requires a tweak that excludes the lock-time construction. So at the moment, with what we know, we have to choose between either (a) small initial block download, or (b) supporting payment channels. I think people are favouring (b) over (a).
But mimblewimble does at least make great strides towards bettering the fungability situation, making it easier to accept the hit to transaction size that comes with confidential transactions. And being able to elide intermediate transactions within a single block is a big win.

You can mine empty blocks in bitcoin today.
But if the question was "what prevents a miner from selecting a 1kB max block size and generating blocks with extremely low difficulty?" There are three answers: (1) the miner is giving up fees; (2) the miner is only allowed to deviate by a small amount from the current limit, e.g. +/- 25%; and (3) to prevent disruption there would have to be a hard lower bound of 1MB -- miners are free to generate smaller blocks, as they do today, but they gain no benefit in the form of difficulty decrease from going below 1MB.

You have the causality backwards. Those who are against block size increases are "terrified" of reckless changes to the bitcoin protocol doing irreversable harm to the decentralization of bitcoin and forcing us through software scaling limits that have not been adequately tested. _Because of that_ many of us individually are against raising the block size at this point in time, and Blockstream as a company has been working on relief technologies that do not involve block size increases.
The things we as a company would like to do are actually easier in a world of larger block sizes. For example, 1mb places a very hard limit on the size of a sidechain withdraw fraud proof, and restricts us from doing some very interesting zero-knowledge crypto that just unfortunately has large proof size requirements.
Blockstream has no position in the block size debate. We speak as individuals on this matter.

Nothing will.


This is exactly how it would be implemented as a hard-fork as well. The only difference between the soft-fork and the hard-fork is the size of the fraud proofs, which are a few hundred bytes less in the hard-fork. That's the _only_ difference.

No, it's not so easy.
On the network side bandwidth doesn't matter, latency does. Speed of light concerns prevent much from happening there.
Drive storage? Never was an issue in the first place.
CPU? Serial speeds have stopped improving. Number of cores is improving but it is unclear at this time how parallel block validation will be for bitcoin in its final form.
RAM? Not the limiter.
Signature validation methods? libsecp256k1 is within small constant factors of the fastest possible.
IBLT and weak blocks? In the simple forms considered thus far these don't affect scalability under adversarial assumptions. There's some more complex ideas that might but it's still an open research question. This one actually holds out the hope for the largest constant-factor improvement, which is why it's on the capacity roadmap Core adopted.

Most people using CoinJoin make the whole exercise pointless as a result of not taking special precautions with respect to coin control before and after the CoinJoin mixing steps. To use CoinJoin as a mixer you need to be very, very careful about how you transact. And even if you are perfectly careful you are also made vulnerable by the sloppy mistakes of those you join with -- if the other parties identify themselves by whatever means, then you're mixing is undone by process of elimination. Confidential transactions removes much of this risk.

Beyond the technical faults of BU, it does nothing to protect the user against centralizing pressures. The block size limit exists for a reason -- it is an ultimate check on centralizing forces that would work against the interests of non-miners. BU would place the limit and other rules entirely in the hands of the miners, which is like trusting the wolf to guard the flock. BU is not a solution, it is the sort of adversarial attack we need to protect bitcoin against.

They are mutually exclusive, right now. We had a series of data-driven open workshops exploring this question, and the clear result was that the network can't currently handle more than about 2MB block sizes at this point in time and retain its adversarial protections.
Now if you look to the Core roadmap you'll see a number of research directions mentioned (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks) which are expected to increase capacity. The plan, put simply, is this: use the existing excess capacity to deploy segwit; concurrently research and deploy IBLT, weak blocks, and various other network layer improvements; measure and verify that these technologies have in fact at least doubled the available capacity; deploy a block size increase fork. It is most likely that around this time next year we should be working out the details of a 2MB hard fork on top of the already deployed segwit code.
If I were a betting man, that's the outcome I'd put my money on. But the philosophy of Core is conservative, and we do not feel that we should be betting with the entire Bitcoin economy by committing to a 2MB hard fork in addition to segwit and setting dates before we have even developed and tested the technology that would make it safe to do both. The scenario I outlined above is the most probable outcome with what we know today, but there are known unknowns and probably unknown unknowns that could  interfere with such a schedule. We _think_ that the network could support another doubling after mitigating the effects of the Great Firewall. We _think_ that a combination of IBLT and weak blocks will be able to do that, although no concrete proposal exists as yet. We _think_ that deployment of these technologies will be all that is required to achieve the next level of scale. We think. But all of that is untested, and it would be irresponsible and reckless of us to commit to such an outcome before we actually did our homework.
_Right now_, we are only certain that the network could be safely made to support double its present on-chain capacity with either a 2MB hard-fork or segwit deployment. Of these, segwit is the obvious clear winner as it brings other scaling benefits as well. So we can commit to a schedule for that and do our best to meet that deployment schedule. We have also identified the problems that we believe are holding us back from a further doubling, and possible solutions to those problems which require more research. We can commit to doing the proper research in a timely fashion, and hope that deployment of that technology leads to another capacity doubling. But that's an empirical question, and we can't promise the results!
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:56:25
That approach has been considered. It would greatly complicate transaction selection, making it a multi dimensional problem. Fees would no longer be based on just the size of the transaction but rather depend on the properties of other transactions that exist in the miner's mempool. The result would be chaotic with wallets not really knowing how much fee to give when blocks get full.

We don't know that. For example maybe there's a way to combine multiple open/close events together in a space/resource efficient way, while keeping the funds of the channel separate. Maybe there's a safe way to reassign ownership of a channel without hitting the chain.
How do we do that? I don't know, _waves hands vigorously_. I can think of how I might attack the problem and can imagine a few partial solutions, but more research is definitely needed before we know for certain whether it is possible or not. As little as a year ago truly trustless off-chain payments was just as much an "impossibility," until Joseph and Tadge put together previously proposed opcodes and sighash modes to construct Lightning. Seven years ago decentralized ledgers were just as impossible until Satoshi combined hashcash with looser double-spend guarantees.
I think it's a little early to predict what the on-chain requirements will be for future globally accessible payment systems. The extrapolation done by Joseph and Tadge provide upper, not lower bounds. The only thing we need to concern ourselves with right now is what capacity is needed to meet present demand. And that must involve making _both_ protocol and infrastructure more efficient.

It doesn't "require 4MB of total space" -- it allows up to 4MB blocks under very specific (artificial) circumstances. So there had better be capacity to safely handle 4MB blocks or else we're in trouble. But in the expected case it doesn't actually use that space.

Except that experimental data shows this is not a safe thing to do. We have capacity for 2MB blocks, not 4MB, and segwit is the better path to achieving this goal than a max-block-size increase because of the other associated improvements that come with it: ending malleability, upgradeable script, fraud proofs, etc.
2MB now + segwit to 4MB when it is ready is not an option. Not unless you want to wait until weak blocks or something else makes 4MB segwit (8MB worst-case) a safe choice.

It is a sad state of affairs that a not insignificant portion of the bitcoin ecosystem has coins in or going through services run by absentee operators.
But that's not the only issue. Bitcoin full nodes are deployed everywhere. Sometimes the people running the services aren't even aware of how many full nodes they have running in what network topologies. A border router running old code will stop relaying some transactions after the first &gt;1MB block, perhaps exposing that service to double spends even if other parts of their infrastructure are upgraded. It is a bit like the Y2K problem -- easy fix, but everything having to be upgraded and fixed takes an onerous amount of real world time.
A soft fork on the other hand has fail-safe/fail-secure semantics so can be rolled out at a faster pace.

Increasing the block size from 1MB to 1.000001MB, requires a mechanism by which we get everyone to agree to relax their restrictions on what is a valid bitcoin block, or at least to get enough people to agree and somehow coerce the others to fall in line. Understanding why this is generally bad, and a much bigger deal requires stepping back and looking at what bitcoin is and how it derives its user protections.
Running a bitcoin full node is your way of making sure that you can't be swindled into a block chain that doesn't conform to the rules in effect when you joined. These rules include such properties as the fixed money supply and the requirement that funds cannot move without a valid digital signature. It also includes denial of service protections such as a limited block size (to limit bandwidth) and sigop and hashing limits (to limit computational requirements). These rules let you plan out bandwidth and resource requirements today even without knowing future demand for bitcoin transactions. You can be assured that, for example, you will continue to be able to synchronize through networks like Tor, or from remote regions of the world with spotty internet, etc. There is, in essence, a computationally enforced contract in place between all bitcoin full nodes to keep the monetary base fixed, to require digital signatures, to not reverse transactions, and to keep resource requirements limited below a clearly defined maximum.
Performing any hard fork is by its very definition renegotiating this contract with everyone. And it is not possible to renegotiate only certain aspects of the contract -- the same mechanism that is used to increase the non-witness limit by a single byte, just to prove a point, is also the exact same mechanism that could be used to create perpetual inflation, take funds without holding the private keys, to selectively back out or reverse transactions, or to increase validation requirements so drastically that non-regulated individuals can no longer participate.
And that is why the developers insist that any hard fork must be absolutely uncontroversial. Not because they are particularly scared about the danger of 2MB (although even 2MB+SW is legitimately controversial in its resource requirements), but because if coercion is used to drag along the long tail of otherwise powerless fullnode operators, then what does that say about the safety and the security of the bitcoin network against other changes to its fundamental properties? If the People's Bank of China and the Securities and Exchange Commission decide that on-chain KYC is a financial regulation requirement, will a vocal minority of price-sensitive activists be able to force through such changes in the same way? There are many blinded to the social good that a decentralized bitcoin provides, and are just chasing a quick buck. Don't give them the means to destroy something beautiful and empowering because they can be bought.
The best available research right now shows that 2MB -or- segwit is safe. Some sort of hypothetical 2MB+SW is currently controversial because of the increased fullnode resource requirements. It could be possible in a year or two however, after segwit is deployed and more data obtained about how it used and affects resource requirements in production, and other protocol improvements are deployed in the meantime. But even if it were safe in terms of resource requirements, deploying the changes serially with the soft-fork segwit first is just good engineering.
However even then people such as myself argue that we should have only one hard fork to settle this issue, and we absolutely must not under any circumstances set ourselves up for repeated, periodic hard forks. So I would be absolutely against a fixed 2MB hard fork. Something like BIP103 might be able to gain consensus, but it is very conservative. A flexcap would allow market-set block sizes, giving us potentially bigger blocks than BIP103, but with economic incentives constraining resource usage. Either one would be a single hard fork to solve this issue and never revisit it. A 2MB bump, or even 2-4-8 and related proposals, would be a promise to have to make future changes again, which is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion.

Why do you think this has anything to do with Bitcoin Core? The whole UASF movement was started by a litecoin developer. Not a single regular contributor to bitcoin is involved in any way as far as I'm aware. And even if that weren't true, this advancement of the date was a unilateral action by that same litecoin developer.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:18:43
For the record I wish that there was some sort of public review of this change instead of just updating the document, although as BIP author it was your right to do so.
This puts the UASF activation at 4 months from the present instead of 6 months, which is borderline sufficient in my evaluation, given that it significantly improves the activation likelihood. I certainly wouldn't want it to come any closer. It also moves the activation date away from the likely dates for the next Scaling Bitcoin, which is also good. I wouldn't want this issue to consume that entire workshop.
So overall I think it was the right choice, but seeing these sorts of changes just sprung on the BIP without explanation and public review does make one worry. A conservative grassroots effort like UASF needs to value review and technical analysis in order to earn its legitimacy in the eyes of the user base. I'd be more careful in the future, with a mailing list message and a pull request.

Ironically it failed at the one thing most developers wanted out of it which was ending the unasked for "core developer" title.

That's an impossible ask I'm afraid :( For any voting scheme it becomes necessary to commit to only _one_ vote, for reasons that I hope are obvious. Yes there are ways of putting a commitment into a transaction that makes it indistinguishable from a regular bitcoin transaction without extra information. But the miner just has to refuse to mine the transaction unless you show (to them) the extra information that discloses your vote, or otherwise prove that you are not participating in the vote.
EDIT: To be clear I'm really enamoured with pay-to-contract and sign-to-contract and other forms of hidden commitments. I play with designing higher level protocols using these tools in my free time. I think one of their chief values is uncensorability, but the key assumption here is that the miners don't care. A hostile-against-the-miners UASF vote against the miners invalidates that precondition though :(
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:54:48
Bitcoin Core is unlikely to ever put this UASF code in a release. The whole point is to be a grassroots activation, which means Bitcoin Core as a brand should not get involved.

Actually this visualization is useful for for illustrating one of the problems that this code is designed to prevent: the typical drop in performance as soon as you exceed the designed-for number of errors. E.g. if your code is designed to detect up to 4 errors and your string has 5 errors, a "sphere packing" code would have a much lower error detection rate for 5 errors than you might expect it to.
This is because if you imagine the valid encodings being the center points of the sphere, and the number of detectable errors being twice the radius of the sphere, then as soon as you exceed the designed error tolerance you immediately incorporate a large number of neighbouring sphere-centers (valid strings), since the spheres were tightly packed. For example, if your checksum is designed to always detect up to 4 errors and have a false positive rate for random inputs of 1 in a million, then for 5 errors it might have a 1 in 100k false positive rate, 1 in 500k for 6 errors, and 7+ approaches the random rate of 1 in 1M. (Probabilities made up for purposes of illustration.)
This is actually exceedingly bad for this use because we should expect something like a power-law distribution of errors, with 5-error inputs occurring more frequently than 6 or more errors.
Part of the research that went into selecting the polynomial for this address encoding checksum was doing an exhaustive search of the possible codes to find one that not only performed better than the theory guarantees (providing a detection guarantee for 5 errors instead of 4), but also didn't exhibit this threshold weakness.

I disagree. Bitcoin is a consensus system, the whole purpose of which is to get shared agreement over current state. Eventual consensus without human intervention requires using the same set of rules. The "no contentious forks" policy isn't "never change the rules" but rather "only change rules in lock step" for the purpose that at any given instance the same set of rules are in effect on all nodes. This ensures that all full nodes will reach eventual consensus on the state of the ledger, for without consensus bitcoin isn't very useful as a shared ledger...
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:51:14
On-chain bitcoin transactions will never supplant the financial system. If you grew on-chain capacity to that scale, it would become a few fixed nodes with direct fiber-optic links and mining replaced by block signatures because a dynamic membership set makes no sense when no one else has the capability to join. It would turn into a hugely wasteful version of the existing financial system.
No, the uniqueness bitcoin offers and its sole value proposition as an asset is precisely it is precisely this dynamic membership set (what people are calling apolitical, because it cannot be tied to any one group). Or what is commonly called around here decentralization.
Thankfully it happens that we can have our cake and eat it too, but supplanting the financial system using more scalable layer-2 protocols that only settle on the bitcoin blockchian periodically.

I don't think the HK thing can be described as "reasonable terms", and I don't think I'm alone in that assessment. 2MB+SW hard fork just isn't safe.
It is also entirely the wrong precedent to set. This is not how bitcoin should be governed, and it is important to cut off governance models that would inevitably lead to centralized control over the parameters of the bitcoin network. I personally like UASF for the sole purpose of taking control over consensus changes out of the hands of the miners or developers. Changes to consensus rules should require a grassroots user support behind it.
So no, I don't think Core (which btw is not and never was a singular entity) playing politics is ever a solution, no matter the circumstances.

Fuck no. Hard forks are incredibly dangerous, both presently for the danger they pose to the long tail of businesses and users that might mishandle the upgrade, and to the precedence it sets for the future. If there is a hard fork it is to be done once, and only once, and resolve this issue permanently. A single 2MB bump does almost nothing in the grand scheme of things and pretty much guarantees that further hard forks will be necessary. That is an entirely unacceptable outcome.
A compromise is where you meet in the middle. But I don't think you are understanding the viewpoints of the other side as this "compromise" results in worse outcomes across the board from the decentralist perspective. There's no benefits here. I'd rather have the safety and security of no hard forks _ever_, than to walk down that dangerous path.

It is not the case that "everyone agrees" that 2MB max block size + segwit would be safe. Numbers presented (by Classic devs, no less!) at Scaling Bitcoin HK showed this would definitively _not_ be safe.
Re 6: I do not agree there is merit to the idea that now is way too premature for a fee market. On the contrary the later we wait the _harder_ it will be to change. Swallowing some tough medicine now is better than an emergency, higher risk amputation later. If we need to transition to a fee market, better to get that done sooner rather than later.
I also disagree that the larger the user base the more secure bitcoin will be. Rather I think it will present a larger target, and bitcoin's security _only_ comes from its decentralization, which would be weakened by unchecked block size increases at this time.
Re 8: I can make up numbers too. Some people have expressed concern that 6 months is too short. However regardless it is way to early to be setting dates when we don't even know if it would be safe to carry through on that promise.

Anything done on-chain has the fundamental flaw that miners control what makes it to the chain. I don't know how a UASF can be achieved other than to get the businesses representing the economic majority (e.g. major exchanges and payment processors) to publicly state that they will begin rejecting non-segwit blocks starting on date $TBD in the future. I would be okay with this outcome, fwiw.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:15:34
They are driving up the fee estimation. The attack is that they are sending transactions with high fees about as frequently as it takes for each one to hop across the network. If they are being smart they are sending them to nodes maximally distant from the miners, in terms of network topology.
The smart fee estimator works by looking at what transactions are in your mempool but did not make it into the most recently found block. Chances are, you heard about one of these transactions but it did not make it into the block found by the miner (which took some seconds to get to you, and which also was a few seconds stale from the pool's mempool when it was found). So your wallet assumes you have to pay a higher fee than this transaction in order to get into the next block.
This could be very profitable for a miner to do because (1) they recoup some of their own fee, and more importantly (2) everyone else pays artificially higher fees because their clients were duped.
The prevention is to have the smartfee code ignore transactions in the mempool that are less than, say, 30s old.

You can't use random numbers in a consenus algorithm. What would you do, make sure everyone generates the same random number? That's not very random!
But it describes rather well how proof-of-stake systems work. You have some deterministic function which takes the chain history as input and outputs which coin holders are allowed to sign the next block.
The _problem_ is that history can be rewritten. If I want to take control of a proof-of-work system, what I do is go back to a block I have or can get the signing keys to, (or wait until I get selected for the chain tip) and start grinding various potential next blocks until I find one that names me or my sockpuppet as the next signer. Repeat for the next block.
This attack essentially turns proof-of-stake into divergent proof-of-work, as I fight with other attackers to gain and keep control of the chain tip.

The HK agreement was only signed on to by a small minority of developers, who had no power to push through anything themselves, and it was immediately and viciously ridiculed by the rest. It was DOA even before it was publicly announced. The tragedy is in non-developers feeling hurt that they _thought_ they were dealing with Bitcoin Core as an entity that could be represented by a couple of people in a closed door meeting. But that is emphatically not how bitcoin works.

No need given the deployment mechanism. It activates by forcing the BIP9 activation of segwit, so it remains compatible with all 0.13.1+ nodes. As a consequence of this, it is delayed as long as it can be since that opportunity to deploy safely goes away when the segwit BIP9 bit deactivates.

The point is that this isn't a change that would have to be "called for" or "argued in favor of". Someone will just do it, or it happens as a natural matter of course without anyone explicitly trying to make it happen.
For example, what happens when one entity has a 20% cost advantage over the competition? They have access to the best ASICs. They have the cheapest power. AND their blocks cost them 20% less to find? How could anyone compete with that and stay profitable? That entity might not have set out to become the gatekeeper to the Bitcoin network, but they would have de facto become it regardless.
Note that this isn't a hypothetical -- it is precisely the decentralization risk provided by a technology like ASICBoost, or the kind of asymmetrical situation that arises when you combine large block sizes with large latencies.

Segwit will not be in 0.13.0. The code, maybe (TBD), but it will not be active.
What's going on here is that there's a number of useful things in the pipeline which are built on top of the segwit code, since segwit moves a few things around, but which are logically unrelated. These are currently being blocked. So the suggestion is that we merge segwit very soon, but deactivated, so that these other pull requests can be merged too for the 0.13 release. This might happen.
But segwit itself will not be activated in the 0.13 release. 0.13.1 (and 0.12.2) is most likely.

Sure, by preemptively hard-forking a different proof of work.

@_date: 2016-06-05 16:57:05
That's not how math works. There's a fixed amount of space per block. Segwit transactions use roughly half as much space as their non-segwit versions. Because they use half as much resources they pay half the fee, for the same reason that a 1kB transaction today pays half as much fee as a 2kB transaction. If the average fee per unit space goes up, then it goes up for everybody uniformally. But the segwit transaction is still half-fee compared to its non-segwit counterpart.

(U.S. centric advice:) Unfortunately, yes. The IRS treats Bitcoin as property, not a currency. This has two major ramifications: (1) you pay capital gains tax instead of ordinary income [big plus in the current market], and (2) there's no low-value exemption [not so hot, as you point out] which for example is what keeps you from having to report loss/gains of your euros while you travel around Europe.
I personally have minimized my paperwork burden by immediately buying bitcoin that I use. So if I have an invoice for 0.5 btc, I buy 0.5 btc on Circle and then immediately send 0.5 btc from that wallet to the invoice address. I then only need to sell and track capital gains e.g. once a month to net out that month's expenses. The cost to me is that I get hit with the exchange fee twice, but that's worth it for the paperwork reduction.
As always on this topic, you should consult a tax professional, not Reddit.

Not below reasonable thresholds ($200 of capital gains per purchase I think?). If you buy a Lamborghini at the source with appreciated Euros then you may run afoul of income tax on the appreciated value. But a college student backpacking through Europe doesn't need to report the gain in value of his Euros from the ATM withdraw to when he spent it at the pub. Not so with bitcoins where every gain and loss must technically be tracked, same as if you used Apple stock certificates as cash.

"Asymptotic shape" doesn't mean "going down." A curve can approach any value as an asymptote--negative infinity, positive infinity, zero. They can even approach other curves such as a slanted line. It's perfectly fine to say that a curve that looks like an upwards-facing parabola is "parabolic," even pedantically.
And figuratively, the term comes from a comparison to parabolic orbits in celestial mechanics, which describe escape trajectories. Technically they could also describe capture orbits, but the analogy makes no sense here.

That's not a very charitable reading, Greg.
Forward blocks doesn't bypass bitcoin's inflation guarantees.  There's no way to print money here.  There's no proposal for demurrage on bitcoin.  There is a layer of indirection added in the form of the coinbase payout queue, but the whole point of the queue is delay payment until actual coins have been collected or generated.
The word "attack" ascribes moral intent which is not a fair understanding of the situation.  Arguably the currently preferred approach to on-chain scaling, the "forced hard fork" / "evil fork" is also an attack on layer 2 nodes that need to listen for channel closures.  There is a trade-off here: do we prefer to maintain resource usage for non-upgraded nodes or break compatibility for non-upgraded layer 2 nodes? We need to pick one, and which one is not an obvious choice IMHO. It's perfectly reasonable to pick a position, but to label the other position as an "attack" is not a very cooperative approach to technical debate.
All the technology described in this paper is there because of an actual connection to the forward blocks concept, equal or greater in strength than the connection of script versions to segwit, for example:
  * Sharding is a necessary component of the scaling analysis since it has a \~30x impact on censorship resistance. It also can only be deployed at activation of forward blocks and can't be added in later.
  * Rebatable fee markets are necessary to determine a clearing price for a block, an essential part of the flex cap proposal described in the paper.
  * Confidential transactions/mimblewimble and side chains are all clearly marked as future extensions and are only discussed in so far as the techniques used for moving coins in and out of these ledgers are exactly the same as are developed for sharding and coinbase payouts area (indeed it was invented first as a scheme for CT/CA soft-fork deployment).
I think I'm pretty clear about this relationship in the paper, but if it needs to be modified please let me know.

I am. I'll say that a 2x increase at this time is inherently bad. We had a wonderful series of workshops that showed among other things that the bitcoin network at the time was only able to support a maximum block size of 4MB -- and that's what segwit ALONE provides. There's no room for the 2x. Those numbers are about a year and a half out of date, but nobody has done the work to replicate the results with more recent bitcoind + FIBRE. But until they do, and until it shows that 8MB is safe, the 2x part is out of the question.
Additionally, yours truly has been consistent since the very beginning in saying that we should NEVER make a habit of hard-forking small one-time bumps. That sets a dangerous precedent that is also intolerable, even if the change itself is acceptable (which it is not, right now). That's why flexcap was invented and we should be talking about a flexcap hard fork or a flexcap extension block, not a one-off 2x multiplier.

Article has been deleted? ...
EDIT: Based on the archive links (thank you!), it was a well-written, polished, professional letter. I'm annoyed that it was immediately deleted. The authors obviously put a lot of time into it and feel quite strongly. More communication is not a bad thing. Now regarding the document:
You transition from the Scaling Bitcoin II Workshop to the first Bitcoin Roundtable conference as if these two were at all related. One was a data-driven, open-access academic workshop attended by all who were able, the other was a closed-door, invite-only meeting intended on forcing a solution. Whatever outcome came out of the latter was meaningless -- it had no democratic legitimacy and lacked the open-review that must be necessary for changes to Bitcoin consensus policy, setting a terrible precedent for the future. The Hong Kong "consensus" was dead on arrival and made itself irrelevant by the very way in which it was constructed. This is true *regardless* of what the outcome might have been.
Regarding the actual document itself, I can't guess the thinking of those who signed the document. I wasn't there. I didn't sign. I *wouldn't* have signed that document. It isn't binding to me, legally or morally. As far as I'm concerned, that thing might as well never have existed. Life goes on and we continue to make progress forward according to the only document which has ever achieved any consensus in the Bitcoin developer community, the scalability roadmap hosted on bitcoin.org:

To respond to a channel closure you need to be able to create a transaction spending the temporarily locked outputs in the closed channel. With malleability fixed, you can pregenerate that transaction and send it to a 3rd party.
Without malleability fixes, you can't pregenerate the transaction because you don't know what the resulting input txids will be, so you can't create a digital signature. You still have the necessary information to respond, but you can't delegate because the information necessary is the private keys and hidden secrets that would let the 3rd party steal your funds.
Put differently, outsourcing of channel closure watching works by giving a 3rd party a way to respond that is constrained. They can take back the funds of the channel, but only by forwarding the funds on to you (with maybe a small fee for themselves). You do this by pregenerating the transactions. Without malleability fixes though, you need to give the watcher the ability to create transactions in response to malleated inputs. The "deployable lightning" variant which can be done on bitcoin today would result in the outsource watcher having custodial control -- they'd have all the information necessary to just outright steal the funds. So for trustless operation, you'll have to watch the chain yourself.

Except  when you analyze these charts you're demonstrating another bias: confirmation bias. There are a number of ways in which the charts are similar and there's also a vast many number of ways in which the charts are different. Because you know the outcome (hindsight bias) you look for the reasons why they are the same and ignore the reasons why they are different (confirmation bias). The result is you trick yourself into seeing a pattern that is actually just noise.

It gives time for the other party to respond. These payment channels work by the close-out transaction having two spendable code paths: by you, after a delay, or immediately by the other party if they have a piece of knowledge only you have (a hash preimage or private key). Each off-chain transaction on the channel reveals the info of the last transaction so it is no longer safe for you to broadcast the older versions -- if you did the other person, now knowing the secret info, would claim the funds while you were stuck waiting.
That 'waiting' could be regular old absolute lock times, but that has the very annoying property that you must pick a date in advance that the funds will be locked until. So if you have a 6mo channel and close it out after two months but the other party is uncooperative, your funds will be stuck for 4 more months. Very annoying.
BIP 68 and 112 (CSV) let you start the clock only when the channel is being closed out, which has two primary implications: channel close-out can be much faster (configurable, but realistically a few days in the worst case), and channels never expire. Pretty cool.
CSV is also useful for the sidechain 2-way peg, or any other application that involves waiting for things to settle or to see if anyone can provide a fraud proof.
(I invented CSV. Ping me if you have other questions.)

So if I'm starting up a bitcoin business, or whatever, I need to wait months until I have a trustless data source available? I think that's very far on the suboptimal end of the spectrum. The reality in such a world is that approximately no one would run full nodes bootstrapped from scratch, except those who are already running, and we'd see basically all businesses rely on 3rd party APIs instead.
I think the red line is much closer to 24hours on pro hardware. More than that and it becomes too much of an inconvenience and we see a switch off of full nodes and onto 3rd party data sources, like we are already seeing today.
Unfortunately that means we need either technology like mimblewimble or radical block size reduction to constrain sync times.

There are many ways to do cross-chain atomic swaps. Some, like Greg Maxwell's CoinSwap, are implementable today. Lightning would be more efficient as it takes the same number of transactions to setup the payment channel, and the payment channel can be reused. Such an application of Lightning channels would be workable as soon as segwit activates. CoinSwap you can do today, however.

Yes you have to be a broker, but that's not an exclusive club, and there is a minimum redemption order. If you open an account with the same storage facility they are using you can be redeemed directly instead of by cash. You then use whatever transport services the warehouse uses to get it shipped to your home, if that's what you want.
In reality no one actually does this. But it has to be possible to be done for the security to be classified as a ETF in the first place. (Otherwise it would be an ETN or other such classification instead.)
The cash equivalent isn't some trickery to hide the fact that they are gold insolvent (although this may be true.. how would we know?). Rather, it is in recognition of the fact that the people actually doing this are mostly HFT and hedge funds who are arbitraging the difference in price from the ETF to actual commodity spot prices. Their only interest in redeeming GLD shares is to cash out for USD anyway in an arbitrage opportunity. Cash equivalent just saves everyone some hassle.

I really don't have any idea what "Schrodinger's ETF" means, so I wouldn't know how to respond to that.
But the situation here is that the SEC will rule one way or the other. The outcome of this may already be pre-determined, being dependent on a number of things that are already in flight. However you or I or anyone else lack the information necessary to know the outcome for certain, so the best we can do is compare with prior cases, scrutinize what has been said by the SEC already, etc. etc. and come up with a posterior estimation of the odds for various outcomes.
Put differently, the OP would be saying "I lack insight into what the SEC is thinking. Because of my lack of information, I can't rule out all the possible situations that could be playing out. In only 1 out of 4 of these situations is the COIN ETF approved."
Put differently again, it's not like the SEC is flipping two coins and approving the ETF only if they both come up tails. If the exact same circumstances were to come up, the SEC would rule exactly the same way in every single case. That's what I meant by the outcome being "predetermined" above. The 25% likelihood represents a lack of information we have about the present circumstances or decision-making process of the SEC, not any intrinsic indeterminism.

Counterparty doesn’t support SPV. To have any idea if a counterparty payment is valid or not, you need to validate the entire blockchain. You can’t just give a Merkle proof of the transaction and rely on the economic argument that if the transaction were invalid then the block would be invalid, because that is not true – Counterparty transactions aren’t verified by the miners and an invalid Counterparty trade history can very easily become part of the bitcoin blockchain. In the case of a bitcoin payment, being on-chain gets you something – the economic security of SPV mode, since the data is validated. Counterparty gets nothing.
The “fix” here is for Counterparty transactions to be linked to each other in-band, and then provide Merkle proofs for each of the component transactions in the payment history, in a way that minimizes the number of transactions that needs to be provided. This is the “linearized coin histories” technique described by Peter Todd at Scaling Bitcoin, but is essentially the same approach as colored coins. Now this new-XCP protocol has an SPV mode. But we can go further:
There is still no reason for new-XCP to have its data on-chain, since the security of a full block is really no different from an SPV node, as the data still isn’t validated. All that the bitcoin blockchain provides to such a parasitic system is double-spend determination. And there is a technique by which one could get ALL of that benefit without even a single extra bit of data on the public blockchain, without even identifying your transaction as being part of the parasitic system at all. It’s a variation on colored coins that uses sign-to-contract to verifiably embed a hash into a ECDSA signature. You move out-of-band assets into a bitcoin UTXO and in doing so indicate where in the spend of that UTXO the commitment to the next transaction will be found.
Tada, you now have an entirely out-of-band system that is secure and private (selective disclosure) with its double-spend protections and SPV / linearized coin history mode tied to the bitcoin blockchain.
(If anyone cares, I’ve given this approach the name “committed assets”, but haven’t had time to implement it myself )

Which is precisely what I set out to accomplish in the forward blocks proposal -- every node sees and fully validates every transaction.  Isn't that what you want?
If you take your line of reasoning, then we should never have any soft-forks, ever.  After all, an extension mechanism like segwit has old nodes NOT validating spends of new transaction outputs.  As you say, this is not full validation.  But comparatively, with forward blocks every node does validate every transaction.  That's a step up!
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:54:22
Yes it is extension blocks that you are describing, essentially, and the difference comes down to forward blocks relaying transactions from the extension block to the old chain.

No, actually the opposite. One of the ways it was made palatable to other developers was the hope that it would coopt and replace an existing nomenclature that nobody liked: refering to developers of bitcoin reference software as "bitcoin core developers." The intended parsing of that statement, which no one working on bitcoin used, was "bitcoin (core developers)" as in that elite cabal that works on bitcoin reference software. Nobody liked that. It promotes the wrong image, it doesn't describe how bitcoin development works, and it leads to all the nonsense that we see with blockstream conspiracies now. The hope was that we could retake the phrase as "(bitcoin core) developers" and have it take on a more inclusive meaning. Unfortunately the opposite happened.

A lot of hassle.. as I said elsewhere it makes good transaction selection for blocks no longer a tractable problem. Right now you can just use weight only and stop if you hit other limits (sigops, etc.), but don't use those other limits in selection. Limiting the max serialized block size to 4MB with a max weight of 8M would mean that you are forced to consider two limits, which takes us from the realm of "easy, simple solutions" to a category of problem for which good general solutions are intractable. And it's not just the miner's problem either as it would now mean that wallet software has to do the same AND make assumptions about other transactions on the network to assess the appropriate fee for its own transactions... it'd be a giant clusterfuck of a mess.

Wow that's an old quote. I don't think I've said anything about Counterparty since then.

It is possible to implement all the features of Counterparty in a way that doesn't use a single extra byte of bitcoin block space, is correspondingly more private, and shares the same security model as Counterparty has today. And yes, I still think Counterparty should be doing this off-chain. If there is no reason for it to be on-chain, then there is no reason for it to be using up limited resources.

Well there are really brain-dead stupid regulations at play here. For example, where I live in certain types of buildings a *single-occupancy* restroom needs to be marked either for Men or for Women.
Wtf? It's a room with a locking door and a toilet. Even setting aside the transgender issue (which one do they use? they run a risk either way), it's sub-optimal because you end up with huge queues for one while the other sits empty, despite the fact that _it really doesn't matter_ which one someone uses because it's a single room with a single toilet and a door that locks.
So one of the transgender political issues getting play is that these sorts of single-use washrooms should be marked "Man or Woman" in their signage. And that just makes common sense if you ask me.

Nobody decided that 1mb is "the proper blocksize." That's why segwit allows up to 4MB blocks, which was determined by a scientific process.

There are many who have not been convinced by the available data that a straight block size increase is even a safe thing to do at this time. So a solution was found which allowed a larger effective size and ALSO fixed a bunch of other capacity-limiting problems bitcoin has, and which kept almost the same worst-case upper bound on the amount of resources a block could consume. E.g. the quadratic-hashing attack is not any worse with segwit than it was otherwise.

On altcoins, and on the early history of bitcoin, there simply isn't/wasn't enough absolute demand to fill a block. Once there is though, there isn't really any going back.
While a mathematician would rightly point out that demand isn't literally infinite, it might as well be. At some point someone writes a FUSE wrapper to use the block chain as a writable storage pool and some jerk starts backing up his porn collection encoded as transactions on the block chain. If it only costs him $0.50 to do so, why not? If transactions were free there'd be so much demand for them that we might as well call it infinite, it is pragmatically the same thing.


That merely shows that people were willing to pay higher fees in the first place. It's how price discovery works in any market.

The talk is at best an extended abstract preview of the paper, which goes into much more depth. I suggest reading the paper.
Everything discussed in the paper except for the final "extension outputs" section are necessary components of forward blocks. This isn't a grab-bag proposal.
Sharding and adjusted block intervals are a necessary part of making any block size increase at all viable, and must be rolled out as part of forward blocks at activation as they can't be done later.
Smoothing out subsidy on the compatibility chain in SOME way is absolutely necessary, because of the variance imposed by confirmation of forward blocks.
Time locking isn't broken in any way at all because time-locks are verified separately on both chains.
It's a pretty telling assessment of the state of the community that earnestly given proposal that someone doesn't like is labeled as an "attack on bitcoin."

High fees is just a fact of life. The system is built to subsist on transaction fees, and it is limited in how large it can scale due to decentralization concerns. The net result is that inevitably, eventually fees will replace subsidy as incentive for miners providing security to the chain and transactions will require high fees to confirm. We are in the process of transitioning to this state of affairs now.

Bitcoin is an uninteresting, illperformant, useless thing if it did not provide one thing that could not be achieved in any other way known to humankind in 2008: uncensorable transactions manipulating a decentralized ledger.
Both of these properties of bitcoin derive from the consensus rules that were in place at the time bitcoin was created, AND the fact that consensus rules can be further restricted but not lifted.
The argument that bitcoin obtains these properties from the ruleset and initial conditions is basically economic: the incentives are such that categories of dangerous rule changes can't be pulled off.
In some places it has been found that the economic arguments are not as sound as we thought. For example, mining pools did not exist in 2009. Satoshi very clearly did not foresee the creation of mining pools, or the massive asymmetry of ASIC hardware. And the resulting consolidation of hashpower into a countable number of pools completely destroyed many of the arguments for bitcoin's decentralization at the time that I first found out about bitcoin.
Does that mean that we should simply accept that bitcoin is not decentralized? No, I don't think so, not any more than we should accept bitcoin to be inflationary because of a quirk in the C++ standard and x86 architectural choices (BIP 42).
Which is all a very long winded way of saying (1) decentralization is a core property bitcoin, the only thing that makes it relevant, and (2) it is entirely appropriate to evaluate the OP's proposal by the metric of "how does this affect the economic and political incentives that make bitcoin stable and decentralized?"

SiFive is working on two lines of chips. One is basically a programmable 32-bit microcontroller. Maybe that's what you are thinking of?
The other is a 8-core, 64-bit out of order execution model, 1.6Ghz workstation-class 28nm CPU with an attached bridge to handle the standard suite of desktop peripherals (PCIe 3.0, USB3.0, GbE, DDR3/4). This is specwise in line with a low-end POWER8, but benchmarks might put it at comparable speed to a mid-range POWER8 or server class x86 processor given already demonstrated architectural efficiencies. Furthermore we should expect a rather large step up in performance for the 2nd or 3rd generation chips on this line as they move from 28nm to 14nm or better processes.

The goal of the Trinity study which came up with the 4% number was to not exhaust retirement funds over 30 years, not preservation of principal. However the end result in the analysis was basically the same -- in the vast majority of cases were retirement funds were not exhausted over such long periods of time, the principal was also retained. Repeats of the study looking for preservation of principal came up with nearly the same numbers. If you want to be assured of this, ~3.5% gives the same risk of losing principal as ~4.0% did for exhausting funds entirely.

I'm one of the people quoted in the article, by the way.
The three arguments presented by Mr. Olds are:


This is pretty much a strawman, as I don't know anyone who would agree with it as written. Nobody argued for keeping the limit smaller than it needed to be. It does not stand alone as a reason for wanting a block size limit. More charitably one might argue for a temporary lower limit, for testing purposes, or argue that we should do a single hard fork and not multiple successive limit increases (this is my view). But even with that interpretation I would not have put this reason first as Mr. Olds did.
But regardless it is actually a historically correct observation. We used to have smaller policy-enforced block size limits. We used to have a plan for safely testing fee market tools in production by keeping these limits in place when they are reached. That way we would get the advantages of testing in production but if there was problem the limit could be easily raised, either temporarily or in a slow ratchet up to the hard limit of 1MB. This would allow vital testing of fee market tools
But what actually happened is the developer in favor of no block size limits whatsoever repeatedly merged default policy bumps before the limit was ever hit, despite objections, and then sneakily increased the policy all the way up to 750kB (it was previously either 150kB or 250kB, IIRC) in a way that bypassed peer review. Then once that limit was approached, a political shitstorm + backroom conversations got the policy limit removed altogether.
So we had a limit in place. We had a reason to keep that limit temporarily for the purpose of testing the fee market infrastructure. But someone who was against fee markets in general orchestrated a sky-is-falling "never hit the limit!" campaign to get it increased every single time it was approached. So reality check: the slippery slope argument was not a what-if, but actual historical truth here.
Thus, an argument based on facts ("Last time we had this problem, we did X but Y happened") not political viewpoints.


Bitcoin requires fees in the long term, when subsidy has gone away. This is fact. The _fee market_ is how transactions safely bid for block space, establishing the cost of a bitcoin transaction. These are all ideas tracing back to the very origin of bitcoin itself, some of them in the Satoshi whitepaper. They are relatively uncontroversial, as far as I'm aware.
The claim is the 2nd part of the sentence "so it’s important to create a fee market soon". This is a technical claim, if you actually read the quotes that back it up: we must test the infrastructure for a fee market NOW, so that when it is required later we know that it works. Otherwise bitcoin might actually fail.
This is basic engineering safety: test early, and test when the consequences of failure are smallest.


Again, a statement that isn't a what-if claim but just pointing to the historical record. The need for a fee market was known since 2009. The ideas that would make a fee market possible -- safe RBF, and dealing with replacement transactions for example -- were created shortly thereafter. Since at least 2013 there had been strong advocating from the bitcoin core developers to infrastructure people (services, wallets, etc.) to implement these technologies. Almost nobody did.
As soon as we hit full (1MB) blocks? Nearly everybody had fixed their infrastructure to deal with replaced or malleated transactions, within weeks or months of it becoming an issue.
Simple historical observation: all the good intention in the world counts for shit. People won't write code until they have to (see also, Y2K).

Deep learning is poised to upset truly massive industries in a huge way, bigger than anything the GPU market has been to date. And NVIDIA is executing on that opportunity in a way AMD and Intel never will. And, most importantly, that's not a conclusion reachable from the financial numbers but rather a technical/engineering analysis someone on Wall St wouldn't be qualified to make. 
I've made a few such picks before, Apple with the release of the iPod or first iPhone would have been another. SpaceX is one I would own, if it were possible. However you can't count on these opportunities appearing any more often than every few years. The trick is recognizing what is a real opportunity and what is hype. And for that there is no substitute for domain experience.

By "safely" shutting down the old chain you remove any threat of divergence, which is _exactly what is protecting_ users of the old chain from having the rules changed from underneath them.
Under the current system the default behaviour in the face of a hard fork is to continue operating under the old rules. If someone wants to force a hard fork, they will run the risk of there being major services and users who do not upgrade and community split occurring. This is a FEATURE. It is DESIRABLE. It is what protects the integrity of the rules. making bitcoin and immutable system as well as an immutable ledger.
This proposal, on the other hand, would eliminate that risk, and therefore eliminate one of the largest hurdles to deploying a hard fork, and _therefore_ eliminate the protection users have from unwanted hard forks in general. Making hard forks easier to deploy is a bad thing that hurts bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-05 10:42:45
This proposal would change the passive default of a hard fork into acceptance rather than rejection. That is to say, if you do nothing in the face of a hard fork you will be dragged along (by finding your chain unusable) rather than remain under the old rules.

Respectfully, I don't think you share my concerns as I consider the hardfork warning system to be similarly dangerous for exactly the same reason.
The fact that users and services can lose money in the event of a chain split is a *feature*. It is a property of the bitcoin network that we should strive to protect. Bitcoin's security rests on economic incentive arguments, and one of those fundamental incentives is to not do things which might destroy the whole system. Right now, that includes all but the most conservative and well-planned uncontroversial hard-forks -- if you make a change that active users or services do not upgrade into, then a ETH/ETC like situation arises. This is an existential risk to bitcoin and so nobody will seriously try. THEREFORE, the minority user base is protected from the tyranny of a the majority push-through of an even slightly controversial hard fork change.
Making hard forks "safe" -- however you do it, by evil fork or by some sort of "safe mode" warning flag -- makes bitcoin the system less immutable.

Right, the payout rate is set by the forward block chain, where the time warp is fixed. If the time warp is engaged on the compatibility chain then some early inflation would technically happen, but it would get locked up until such time as the forward block’s inflation/subsidy schedule catches up. By consensus rules it couldn’t be used for anything in the mean time[0].
I’m glad we are in agreement :) I’ve been getting hit with a lot of charges of inflating bitcoin, and I just wanted to make sure people reading these comments are clear that although time warp allows early inflation to occur, forward blocks is explicitly constructed to prevent that from happening.
[0] To be technically accurate it can be used, but only to pay out cross shard transfers or fee rebates or other things which involve locking up an equal amount of coins. So it can be reached into as a a source of cash float for the protocol, but only in ways where the net coins in circulation doesn’t change.

I had to let it go at the time because it became clear that performance issues would prevent it ever from being adopted in bitcoin core as a committed hash tree. While that may still be the case for the foreseeable future, there is progress being made in a useful direction. Bitcoin Core is moving in the direction of supporting trusted models that would get us halfway there while research is still going on, however.
0.14 introduces the `assumevalid` configuration option which allows the user to bootstrap a new node with less verification when the user already knows the current best block from a node they trust or control. If you are doing this anyway, then it just takes some infrastructure and standardization work to have that trusted node export its UTxO database in a transferable format, and then use that to bootstrap your new node as a pruned node.
However coming back to the topic of this thread, the trouble with having a service like Blockstream Satellite distributing these UTxO 'checkpoints' is that no one should be trusting the data feed we are providing. It would be a safe and reasonable thing to do if there are consensus-rule checking of these data commitments, however. I hope that this spurs research into more efficient UTxO commitments that have a chance of being deployed and enabling these usage models.

Soft-forks are not inherently good. The OP proposal is a soft-fork, and I am against it. I believe that a soft-fork has to be of a very specific form in order for it to be morally neutral/acceptable.
Specifically, Bitcoin Core has developed a very careful policy with respect to soft-fork transaction validation rule changes. Rules are only proposed and adopted which constrain previously non-standard, non-relayable transactions of a format that has not been observed to be in use in the past.
I am very familiar with this policy -- I am one of the handful of people in the world with the dubious distinction of having changed the consensus rules of Bitcoin (BIPs 68, 112, 113). We took great pains to make sure that the relative lock-time rules of BIP 68 required a transaction to be non-standard in MINIMUM 2 different ways for the rules to be used to make sure that someone doing something different (e.g. colored coin proposals that used the sequence field) would not be caught up in this rule change. We then went back and made sure that there weren't any historical transactions which violated these combined rules, as that would indicate that someone, somewhere might be affected. The result is that we were pretty damn sure that every single person using bitcoin now or who has ever used bitcoin in the past would be entirely unaffected by the rollout of relative lock-time / CSV. The same level of care was taken for other soft-forks like CLTV, low-s, and segwit.
That's not what this forced hard-fork proposal would be. In fact it is the opposite: this proposal would make ALL transactions invalid on the original chain. Nobody would be able to transact at all without accepting a change to their consensus ruleset, either an acceptance of the fork or an "anti-fork" rejection of the majority hash power driving the fork. That alone is a unconscionable breach of the social contract, irregardless of the practical concerns which are also significant.


I would not. Hard forks need to be opt-in, or not happen at all. Opt-in vs opt-out defaults have vastly different effects on the viability of hard forks in general, especially when one considers that most bitcoin nodes are not run by people as clued into what is going on in bitcoin space as you or I. What if 90-95% of nodes and services are run by people who don't know or don't care about a given hard fork -- something which is sadly not far from the truth? In an opt-in scenario (the way things are currently), that's a 90-95% vote AGAINST a hard fork, by default. In an opt-out scenario, that's a 90-95% vote FOR a hard fork, with the only requirement being that the consensus changes not be so absolutely terrible or controversial as to arise the attention of these tuned-out sysadmins. I fear for the future of bitcoin in the later scenario. Note that this is effectively the same as Bitcoin Unlimited -- miners set consensus rules by virtue of signalling hard fork changes which require user upgrades, and an economic super-majority of users are conditioned to do so.

No, the "choice" is foisted upon them. The current social contract of bitcoin is that if you are running a full node, and if your transactions adhere to current relay policy and best practices, your ability to access the bitcoin network will never be prevented, no matter what future changes might come. Indeed very early versions of bitcoin will still download and validate the block chain and create valid transactions, although a few p2p relay shims may be required for the earliest versions. This is because new features are gated by transaction versions or standardness policies which prevent them from being accidentally used by transactions generated by earlier software versions.
The current social contact is not "expect that at some point in the future your transactions will stop processing, and then you will have to find out why and make a very political choice about how to proceed." Forcing that choice onto someone is a power asymmetry in favor of minority-proposed forks with majority-hashpower support, because for any one individual the cost of switching to the new chain is small whereas the cost of convincing everyone else to resist with you is high. But when resistance is the _default_, the calculus changes in the other direction.


The safest way to make sure no one loses money is to make transactions revokable and introduce systems of governance and safeguards (courts, arbitration, law enforcement) for invoking that recovery power.
"Make sure no one loses money" is not the goal here. Bitcoin is not a nanny currency that paternalisticly restricts your freedoms for your own good. Bitcoin is an asset for consenting adults that choose some level of risk (their funds being irrevokably stolen or swindled) in return for liberties that would otherwise be unobtainable: the ability to transact without restriction, and the guarantee that the rules you bought into won't be changed from underneath you.
This proposal would purposefully break both those liberties. And no, presenting someone from shooting themselves in the foot is not justification enough to institute a tyranny of the majority. That's not what bitcoin is for.


Either _everyone_ (in the achievable limit, recognizing that there are fully absentee-run bitcoin operations) consents to the hard-fork, or there is no hard-fork at all.

@_date: 2015-08-21 18:37:47
I think that what might be confusing here is that "the network" is not holding coins -- the endpoints of individual channels are. So you and I enter into a micropayment channel contract, where you put in 5 btc and I put in 5 btc. Sometimes I want to make a payment through you and so I send some of my 5 btc to you, and other times you want to make a payment through me and so move the channel in the other direction. We could collectively move thousands of bitcoins through this channel by moving the _same_ bitcoins back and forth again. So if 1,000 btc is transacted in aggregate across 10,000 0.1 btc transactions, to and fro, then so long as those payments are not all in the same direction then the network doesn't need 1,000 btc to track it. It just needs the maximum differential at any point in time.
Think about it like how a bank account operates. Let's say you get paid $1k per week. Let's pretend that this is done with a micropayment channel between you and the bank, which operates a lightning hub. So every week, on payday, your employer sends your money a couple of hops through the network to your bank, which then pushes $1k in your direction. The first time this happens you have $1k, and the bank has $4k remaining in the channel. This continues to happen each week on payday.
But you've got some expenses too -- not just morning coffee and those 2hr lunches at the pub, but groceries and gas, insurance, rent, utilities, etc. Each time an expense or bill comes up _you_ send money to its destination through your bank, crediting back the money you got paid on last week's payday.
So a lightning channels from the perspective of one endpoint is kinda like a bank account, one that is not allowed to go negative or exceed a maximum value. So what happens when you are a good worker bee and squirrel away money, living below your means? Well your channel fills up, and eventually you end up with $5k and the bank holding $0, _which means your paycheck is no longer able to clear_. The simplest solution is to settle the channel (broadcast to the block chain), either claiming your funds or feeding them forward into a new rollover channel with higher limits (e.g. bank puts in another $5k for for a $10k channel with you and the bank starting out each holding half).
More advanced possibilities exist, however. If you have multiple channels with different banks, your paycheck would be routed to wherever "account" had enough free capacity to receive it, or even be split among accounts (channels) automatically. You'd reduce fees in that situation by having your choice of which bank (hub) to use, perhaps with differing fees as a result of current conditions. You'd maybe even earn "interest" by the bank paying you to move funds from one account to another in order to help them rebalance their obligations. This is analogous to an airline paying you to be flexible and take another flight because they're overbooked. It's a bit hand-wavy right now and we really need to see it deployed in practice to fully understand how it would develop.
But what happens when you want to make a payment larger than your channel balances? If it's a regular thing you negotiate a larger channel with your favorite hub(s) and use that. But what about a one-off thing like closing escrow on a house, buying a car with cash, or a super large tax bill? Those you fall back to using bitcoin directly.

The problem is that there are certain people who view Bitcoin lack of true anonymity as a feature not a bug.

Yes this would require soft-fork deployment before it is safe to use in production. The soft-fork threshold is traditionally much higher (95%), and for good reason if you recall the recent fork related to BIP 66 rollout.

It was never re enabled. It's original meaning was "return true." Which was trivially abusable -- put it at the start of the scriptSig to spend any output. It was then disabled -- any script containing it is immediately marked as invalid. That remains it's present meaning.

@_date: 2015-08-15 19:49:00
Quite the contrary! The only redeeming feature of Bitcoin is that it *cannot* change. The consensus rules do not change except by universal consensus, which takes an economic super-majority to force.
Why is the monetary base of 21 million bitcoin fixed? Because changing that requires universal consensus, and that ain't gonna happen. Why is it that Bitcoin transactions are irrevocable? Because changing that requires universal consensus, and that ain't gonna happen.
Name something particularly unique to Bitcoin, and I'll show you how that unique feature is wholly dependent on Bitcoin having fixed consensus rules (otherwise I'll show you how that feature isn't unique to Bitcoin to bitcoin at all, if it doesn't depend on that).
What happened today? Two developers decided to change Bitcoin without universal consensus, in doing so undermining the very nature of the system itself.

The CLTV and CSV opcodes only check transaction data. The script execution code does not have access to the block height or timestamp, and checking validity in that way could lead to some serious architectural issues related to the mempool, and possible security issues relating to reorgs, if done naïvely. So instead these BIPs do indirect tests.
[500,000 CLTV] means that a transaction won't validate unless its nLockTime field is set to &gt;=500,000, which means it won't confirm until block 500,000 at the earliest. The script will execute correctly at any time, but the nLockTime prevents the transaction from getting into a block before then.
[1,000 CSV] means that a transaction won't validate unless the sequence number is set such that, according to BIP 68 rules, the input must have an age of &gt;=1,000 blocks before the transaction can receive a confirmation. Again, you can validate a [1,000 CSV] transaction as soon as you see it, and know that it is valid but also know at a glance that it won't make it on chain until the output it is spending is 1,000 blocks old.

Bitcoin doesn't use Dual_EC_DRBG. Dual_EC_DRBG is a construct that is very, very obviously broken. That's why nobody uses it unless they are forced to, and certainly nobody trusts it. ECDSA is not comparable. It has problems, yes, but not of that sort and our reference implementations are not vulnerable. And the curve? Invented by a private Canadian company, without any unexplainable parameter choices, unlike the NIST curves.
It is virtuous to be worried about government intrusion in cryptographic standards. Those are appropriate questions to ask. But they have been asked and the answers investigated. You can see some record of this here:

To be absolutely clear, "will likely eliminate bandwidth" is in reference to the current implementation of CT, which has transactions some 10-30x[0] as big as bitcoin transactions. Bulletproofs will add a kilobyte or so to a transaction vs today's non-confidential transactions, but that added bandwidth doesn't scale with tx size, so as you add inputs and outputs to a transaction the marginal added cost trends to zero. It's still larger and more work to validate than a non-confidential bitcoin transaction, however.
More serious is that the validation cost is still 10-30x[0] a single signature validation per output, so scaling concerns still exist.

That's simply not how compromise works on technical issues. To borrow another poster's example I know you've seen, imagine I were to offer you a hamburger for $1MM. Just a regular old hamburger. You say "Uh, no. How about $5?" And I reply "Ok, let's meet in the middle. In fact, I'll be excessively generous and meet you in the middle of a log scale: I'll compromise and sell you this hamburger for $7,500. How's that for a deal?"
Do you see the analogy? BIP 103 is, for reasons well thought out and which I agree with, the upper limit of what is achievable without crossing dangerous lines with respect to centralization pressures. Concerns which the XT side don't seem to think are important, thus their numbers are orders of magnitude outside of what could possibly be considered by people who do care about the effect of block size on decentralization. You can't just bridge that gap by taking the arithmetic mean of the two proposals and calling that "compromise." It doesn't work that way.

They want blocks to stay low because they don't want a centralized bitcoin.
Please go read the selfish mining paper linked in another top level comment in this thread for details. The short of it is that a non Chinese miner would find themselves in a continuous state of trying to stay current with the Chinese blocks, meaning enough of the time they don't have the latest block and so are performing stale work themselves. Spending a large fraction of your time on stale blocks is not a way to stay profitable, and inflates the effective hash rate of Chinese miners.

That's not how a hard fork works. If the longest chain is invalid (by your client's ruleset), you will ignore it. Period. It does not matter in the slightest how much hash power is going into that fork, it will be invisible to you.
Bitcoin-XT could fork off tomorrow and 75% of the miners go with them, and guess what? Bitcoin Core would keep trodding along at its own more conservative block size chain. From the perspective of someone running Bitcoin Core, 75% of the hash power just turned off their miners, and a bunch of nodes got banned for relaying invalid blocks, but life goes on. Merchants and infrastructure that are still on Bitcoin Core would ignore XT regardless of its hashpower.
Mining power is absolutely irrelevant to a hard fork.

 There are more than two choices here. I would go down the route of creating a checkbook Ira that Owns the big coins actual private keys. That’s the route I have done.
The point I was making is that if you are expecting the hold GPTC long enough, you must except the fact that you will lose out on both the premium and the asset management fee. The premium will go away as soon as there is some other ETF competition in the space. And while you might think you can sell it fast enough to recover some of that gap, a cynical person would recognize that an insider trader is far more likely.
Unless you’re investing only a few thousand dollars, or on a very short time horizon, it makes more sense to pay the one-time fee to set up a checkbook Ira. Not to mention you actually control the private keys in that case.

It doesn't matter as long as it is unguessable. Some wallets (including the original bitcoin code) used random values. This works, although bias in the random number generator can leak your private key material amazingly fast, among other problems.
The better approach is to use a hash of some value that you know is unique and unguessable. The combined hash of the private key and the message being signed would work. For *reasons*, some good and some drab, the accepted approach to doing this is RFC-6979, which uses something like 12 HMAC evaluations to calculate a single nonce, which is ridiculously over engineered.

The thing is, the relay network only compresses communication at relay time if the miner is cooperating. It is quite easy and cheap to purposefully construct a block which requires and arbitrary amount of data to validate (up to remaining capacity in the block). So the relay network doesn't help under adversarial conditions.
That might be on of it was at least incentive aligned, but it is not. Are you aware of selfish mining? Large blocks are a variant of this where it is technical limitations not choice that delays relay. But the result is the same -- large miners have an incentive to create large blocks so as to make it more difficult for small miners like you to start mining right away.
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:38:06
It wouldn't be economical because in most environments inhabited by humans heat pumps are more efficient than electrical heating by very large factors, so you'd be paying extra for using electrical heat over a proper, efficient, low-energy-usage heat pump, without even considering the supply chain and deployment complexities of operating an internet connected, firmware driven ASIC vs a simple resistive heating element when you do deploy electric heaters.

There is absolutely consensus that it would be a nice thing if Bitcoin could handle a significantly larger number of transactions than it does today. I believe there is also consensus in favor of ponies and unicorns.

Some, like relative lock-time, have already been proposed for inclusion in bitcoin core. Others like native assets are outside the scope of bitcoin and would probably never be proposed for bitcoin core. CT is in a sort of middle ground.

Asserting this doesn't make it true.
In fact, decentralization is the only property which makes Bitcoin the proof-of-work mediated network valuable, and the only property that gives Bitcoin the currency value. Without decentralization Bitcoin has no technical advantage over traditional consensus system, which all scale much better and use fewer resources, and no advantage over electronic fiat systems which are more convenient.

I'm not sure you understand what "safe-haven" means in this context. It's talking about an investment vehicle that does well or even just flat when other aspects of the economy (e.g. equities) are having a rough time. It's a place where investors can park money when they get antsy in order to wait out some market turmoil.
It doesn't matter whether Bitcoin price is trending up or down. What matters is that bear equities markets correlate with either flat or bull markets in the safe haven. And as it happens, the most recent run-up to present price levels directly coincided with equities taking a tumble from events in Greece and China, all the while traditional safe-havens of commodities, bonds, and treasury notes didn't fare so well...

Or just reasonable growth (e.g. BIP 103) plus a commitment to stuff like lightning.
Extension blocks don't really solve the underlying issue any more than sidechains do -- indeed, extension blocks are just sidechains by another name.

There is no trust dependency on LN hubs, and indeed there isn't a need for hubs either. One of the things to work out is how we can help bootstrap a peer-to-peer lightning network without large hubs.

That is not the case with SPV nodes relying on full node data centers. The SPV nodes do not have a fallback option if the settlement layer turns against their interests.

The whole point of LN is as a caching layer. You could have thousands or even millions of off-chain transactions per channel, and only a small number of on-chain transactions per channel (e.g. 2-3, depending on how it is closed).

This trick lets you make the honeypot big enough that it is worth redeeming. Say, 20 bitcoins. Every single machine has full access to the same 20 bitcoins, but which redeem script is used will tell you machine was broken into. So long as 20 bitcoins is more than whatever value the hacker could obtain by quietly keeping the compromised machine, it works as an intrusion detector.

Maybe. u/RustyReddit has a model for doing lightning network without needing a malleability-safe CHECKSIG:
IIRC the first version was broken by Joseph, but it was fixed by Rusty. I think it is safe to say that this new construction is still undergoing necessary peer review, but if it works out then CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY is all that is necessary to implement lightning.
If not, then we still need a new CHECKSIG operator to implement the original lightning spec. That would be a different soft-fork sometime after this lock-time stuff hits (which itself could take 6 months).

Outsourceable policy is the ability to set your hashers to mine for a pool while still performing the transaction selection &amp; coinbase voting yourself. For example, this is what p2pool does.
Smart property miners are hashing equipment with their owner's keys baked into them, and which will only mine against pools or policy servers which the owners authorize. So a smart property miner could be cloud-hosted, yet the data center operator is unable to do anything with the hardware not authorized by its owner.

Neither. The network forms consensus over the application of a shared set of rules AND hash power. Not hash power alone. Your block must validate by other bitcoin nodes running the same software, or your block is invalid. No matter how much hash power is behind your fork -- it doesn't matter.

There is a series of [conference workshops]( being organized to gather and present experimental data and analysis on first general bitcoin scaling, and then the specific proposals.

The delegation feature I was referring to is the ability to attach a P2SH-like script to a signature. Essentially, "I sign this transaction with my EC key, but only if the following script returns a value of TRUE." To use the example you quoted from BIP 65, you could push [500,000 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY] onto the stack as part of the delegation-enabled signature, and during validation the interpreter would first check that your digital signature validates, then check that [500,000 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY] executes to completion and leaves a non-zero value on the stack (which it does if and only if nLockTime is &gt;= 500,000 and &lt; LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD).
Other things in the pipeline include a complete overhaul of script to an entirely different, more expressive language. And allowing script to arbitrarily inspect the transaction data, thereby enabling covenants (which, in their most general form, makes a spend a monadic operation that carries state forward in an otherwise purely functional virtual machine).

Wow your post blew up. Congrats. You seem like a decent person and I want to give you good advice. Hopefully this isn’t lost in the noise of this thread.
First, ignore all the people here who are saying never tell your wife. They are probably (a) not married, or (b) assholes; or both. I myself am in a loving relationship where my wife is both the mother of my children and life partner. That last part is important. Much of my success in life I credit to her, because we work through everything together. Yes, generally speaking she’d be entitled to half of everything in a divorce, but why must everyone focus on that? Alternatively she’d be just as much an equal partner in everything that follows as you explore a long life of financial independence together. Marriage sometimes doesn’t work out, but the chances depend greatly on your approach to it, as any marriage requires work by both participants. If you resign yourself to an eventual divorce then I guarantee it will happen. If, on the other hand, you work at it and love and support each other with optimistic good intentions, chances are you’ll have a great, long lasting relationship for the rest of your lives. The prime cause of divorce is a lack of money, followed by infidelity. The first you have taken care of, the second I assume isn’t an issue. So if you’ve got those bases covered, then go with your gut on whether she feels reciprocally, and if so treat her as a life partner and not a potential enemy at divorce time. Also: the bitcoins are hers regardless of whether she knew about them at the time, so consider that.
Second, this is *NOT* a financial advice forum. I also wouldn’t listen to most of the people here. I suggest you also look at two other subreddits: r/personalfinance for general advice (don’t mention bitcoin there though, they hate it), and r/financialindependence for people in your lucky situation. You shouldn’t trust anyone here to give you good advice — these are people that make speculative bets on weird internet money and want to spend their free time talking about it. You’re talking about transitioning to safe investments for financial security. Know your audience.
Logically, that advice should include me, but I’ve advised others through similar situations, have thought about this has I have young children and early bitcoin investments myself, and good personal finance is a hobby of mine so I’ll carry on. But I encourage you to fact check everything here and seek proper financial (and tax planning) advice.
Let’s establish just how well you’ve done here. 200BTC at today’s valuation is approximately $1.5M. The standard rule of thumb derived from the Trinity study (google it) is that with the assets invested in a mix of stocks and bonds, you can withdraw 4% of the original balance, adjusted for inflation, every year and not run out of money for 30+ years. $1.5M * 4% is about $62k/yr. And given that is taxed as capital gains, not income, that’s approximately equal to your current combined salaries.
So I think you’ve done your math wrong. You’ve made it; assuming “living month to month” means living within your means, which is to say your expenses are about equal to your combined salaries after taxes, you could retire today with a perpetual income approximately equal to what you’re getting by with now. Pat yourself on the back (and go to r/financialindependence to see how to properly manage that early retirement fund, including making proper use of tax sheltered accounts like IRAs, 401ks, and 429’s).
What I would do:
First, read all this information, absorb it, formulate a plan, and then set aside time to drop the bombshell and talk about it. She should be ecstatic to find out about your unexpected new wealth. Emphasize you don’t want anything to change, just with less stress over money and more time with family, a house, etc.
Now your plan, which she should agree to, would be to sell half of it immediately. If you’re going to do anything like have one of you quit a job, you need it to be in more stable investments. Send 20% to the tax man as cap gain withholdings to avoid penalties when you later file. Set aside $100k for your emergency fund and future house (more on that in a minute). Put the rest in a Vanguard brokerage account where you put it all, for now, in VTTSX, the stock-heavy Target 2060 retirement fund. This establishes some financial security, enough that your wife will have the freedom to choose to work or not, while not killing yourself on cap gains taxes this year or foregoing future bitcoin returns. It’s also a reasonable invest-and-forget strategy that prevents you from the temptation of playing the market while ensuring adequate returns. Then until the bitcoins are exhausted, each year sell $75,300 minus your earned income and add what you don’t spend to the Vanguard mutual funds. This minimizes cap gains on the bitcoins.
For your house, set aside $75k from the initial sale in a no-penalty CD, which well let you earn 1.5% or so on it risk-free, while being able to pull it out without fees when you need it. Ally bank offers these, for example. This will let you put 20% down for a good rate, as well as cover closing costs, new appliances, misc fixes the house might need before move-in, supplemental taxes, and rent plus first mortgage payment for the period of overlap. The other $25k is your emergency fund, which I’d also put in a no-penalty CD or high yield savings account (if those still exist).
This is important: DO NOT STOP WORKING YET (either one of you). Do not open any credit cards or car loans either. After 3 full bank statements from selling the bitcoin and moving the proceeds (3-4 months time), your credit will have settled and you can get pre-approved for a $300k loan using the CD as down payment and your paystubs as proof of income. You are correct that the wise financial thing to do is to get a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for the home, even if you technically have the cash. You want that cash working for you on the markets in relatively safe but profitable index funds, not in a real estate investment you can only dip into after the fact with high-rate home equity loans. Just work that mortgage payment into your monthly budget just as you would with rent.
Then with approval letter in hand, find a home you both like, in a nice neighborhood with good schools, and buy. Springtime is usually the best time to go house shopping. Once the transaction closes, keys in hand, your credit is no longer under scrutiny and one or both of you can choose to stop working. If your wife doesn’t like your job or career, then spending time with the little one at home both saves on daycare expenses and helps your kids get a good start in life. She can start working again part-time or full-time if she feels the need when they’re school-aged. You might also consider cutting your hours, even if you enjoy the work you do. Then, for the rest of your life, spend your time with wife and family and doing the things you enjoy.
The most important thing is: *do not allow lifestyle creep*. You may still work part time, if you enjoy it, but make sure the extra income goes 100% into savings, allowing it to increase your drawdown of retirement funds in future years by 4% of the income amount. It can be weird to make $30k and have that only increase your monthly budget by $100, but that’s $100/mo for the rest of your life. Learn to make a budget, and stick to it. Automate the investments by using the target date funds and setting up auto-sell orders that send a monthly “paycheck” to your bank account, and live within your means. Payoff any debts over 4%, pay the minimums on those under 4%, plan for vacations, home repairs, and other large expenses, and stick to your budget. For someone living month-to-month, suddenly coming into money can bring out a bunch of bad habits. Tricking yourself into getting a monthly “paycheck” equal to your budget is one way to stick to your budget — just mentally live month-to-month on only what your financial plan allows for you to draw out of your investments. You may not feel rich as your allowed budget is still tight, but what you’ve bought is your freedom. Congrats.

Bitcoin is not a democracy. Bitcoin is the furthest thing possible from a democracy. Democracy is a rule of the fickle mob; Bitcoin is rule by invariant math.
What gives Bitcoin its only interesting properties is the fact that the rules are so incredibly difficult to change that it only happens by unanimous consensus when the changes are in everybody's best interest.
What gives Bitcoin power is the idea that no one faction can enforce arbitrary changes on another, even if that faction has majority support.
Change that, and Bitcoin loses its freedoms. You might as well be using paypal et al.
We should raise the block size, but only by unanimous consent and with a thoroughly reviewed strategy. XT is not that.

The problem with that statement is “an expert told me”. Mathematics, which includes cryptography, is the one field where we don’t have to rely on someone or something external to evaluate claims. Math is fundamentally true or false and claims about it are checkable and transferable. If there is a flaw, point it out. If the expert claims to have a reason to distrust, ask them to identify it.

Sure. I think we uncovered more of these bugs early in Bitcoin through one intrepid hacker's attempt to reimplement Bitcoin in Haskell than we did by any other effort.
However at the end of the day, the reference implementation remains the standard and _nobody_ should be using alternatives in production. Because there will always remain unknown unknowns and it is not worth risking other people's money to discover them as 0-day exploits in production.
I really suggest you think long and hard about why you consider it unsettling. Once you adjust to the understanding that the code *is* the specification, it becomes unsettling to have documentation people rely on which may or may not match the code...

This is factually incorrect. Plenty of people have cared about this issue since as far back as when the 1MB limit was created. It's just that it is, in fact, a very complicated issue requiring a good deal of effort to come up with and execute on an adequate solution. And one which requires a good deal of other preparatory work e.g. just to make the client able to handle &gt;1MB blocks (which is what most of the last two years has been spent doing).
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:05:10
Theoretically? Sure, anything is possible.
But I can assure you that barring low-probability, catastrophic security vulnerabilities, the protocol will never change in such a way as to make invalid presently valid transactions conforming to best practices.

Sending and receiving are very different problems, and it is appropriate that different approaches are used for each. Receiving requires a constant high-bandwidth data stream. Sending a transaction only requires a few hundred bytes of data, infrequently -- small enough to fit in a few SMS messages, for example. You'd expect the technology for both to be different, and the OP's link is to a receive-the-blockchain technology. I expect there to emerge many different uncensorable transmit-a-transaction technologies as well, using different tech stacks.

The thing is, the relay network only compresses communication at relay time if the miner is cooperating. It is quite easy and cheap to purposefully construct a block which requires and arbitrary amount of data to validate (up to remaining capacity in the block). So the relay network doesn't help under adversarial conditions.
That might be on of it was at least incentive aligned, but it is not. Are you aware of selfish mining? Large blocks are a variant of this where it is technical limitations not choice that delays relay. But the result is the same -- large miners have an incentive to create large blocks so as to make it more difficult for small miners like you to start mining right away.

In a pseudonymous network you are able to combine information in order to reveal identities of the entire network one link at a time, much like solving a Sudoku puzzle. You dox one participant which leads you to others, which leads you to others, etc.
In a truly anonymous network you break one link and that tells you nothing about the others. Your own information security is no longer dependent on the opsec of others. That's a huge deal in my book, and something worth working towards.

20mb to 8mb was not a compromise. It was an arithmetic error on Gavin's part. His proposal was and still is "we should do blocks as large as this test I wrote shows to be possible, and the test says 20mb" [it actually said 8mb when the error was pointed out and corrected].
The "other side" is saying that Gavin's test isn't an adequate measure of how well bitcoin can scale in the present and/or is no indication of future growth, and that we should choose different numbers and/or do something else with respect to scaling.

@_date: 2015-08-18 21:56:26
There still has to be a hard upper limit, especially since selfish mining incentives give miners huge rewards for artificially inflating block sizes or validation time as the block size limit increases.
There are better approach to a dynamic limit which work to counteract these bad mining incentives. I wrote up one of them for the mailing list back in May:
More fundamentally, we shouldn't be talking about block size limits at all. Space on disk/network is only a proxy for what we actually care about: resource consumption during validation. We should instead have some sort of aggregate limit that measures UTXO growth, elliptic curve operations, bytes hashed, memory used, etc.
As for Ethereum, I will not go into details because the GHOST protocol has been thoroughly described and analyzed in the literature, mailing list, and forum. Lowering the inter-block time does more damage to scalability than raising the block size by a corresponding amount to achieve the same throughput. So to achieve maximum scalability we should desire to raise the block size (or resource consumption) limit with the largest acceptable interblock time. Satoshi's choice of 10 minutes per block was very close to optimal, IMHO.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:37:36

No, what I mean is much more basic. Unlimited block sizes leads to miner centralization pressures that prevent anonymous mining. With deanonymized mining it is a relatively simple matter to deny anonymity at the transaction level -- your transactions only get on the chain if you dox yourself to the now state-influenced mining cabal.

And many entities in the ecosystem told him those numbers were bogus, that he was going about it in entirely the wrong way, and what he was measuring didn't really have anything to do with decentralization at all.
He didn't listen.


If 8MB blocks break bitcoin, there are levels of survival we are willing to tolerate, e.g. lightning-like payment layers that settle on &lt;8MB blocks.
But I personally think that Bitcoin can scale, it just isn't ready _yet_. But we're working on it, and it is improving, and we need to have a discussion about how to scale. But we have more time than Gavin and Mike claim.


Yes, because frequent hard-forks are just as much an existential threat to Bitcoin. Imagine what would happen if it were tipped off that Bitcoin could be arbitrarily changed. The next time a hard-fork is made we may not be able to fight anti-Bitcoin lobbyists bent on crippling the protocol.
We should hard fork to fix the block size limit. But we should only do it *once*.

No, neither the bank nor the forex broker is adding any fees with the services I mentioned--I've checked against daily spot prices myself.

We need people to do the work in deploying trustless off-chain scaling technology that would greatly relieve the pressure on the chain, and we need work on fee market support in wallets and relay nodes so as to make hitting the limit a non-issue.

Having your voting power be proportional to your wealth is a failing of the current system, yes, but it'd at least be honest and straight forward to verify and above the board, meaning there could be a great deal more transparency. It's rather sad that no one has made a serious attempt at this yet.

Even using higher private inflation estimates, real wages rose by around 72% from their low point in 2003 to 2013. The global recession did affect the economy in 2009, with growth slowing to nearly zero; but high economic growth then resumed, and GDP expanded by around 9% in both 2010 and 2011. Foreign exchange controls, austerity measures, persistent inflation, and downturns in Brazil, Europe, and other important trade partners, contributed to slower growth beginning in 2012, however. Growth averaged just 1.3% from 2012 to 2014."

These include changing the limit from being over block size (bytes) to be some more direct measurement of resource consumption (UTXO growth, elliptic curve operations, bytes hashed, opcodes executed, memory used, etc.), having the resource limit expand or contract with demand based on a fee market, and/or some form of user, not miner voting over these parameters.
We will be participating in the scalability workshops this year, and hopefully presenting these proposals at the 2nd one scheduled for Nov/Dec in Hong Kong.

Monero is pretty awesome in terms of technology. It just has the unfortunate disadvantage of being unprunable, which is kinda a big deal.
Still it's within the scope of this issue. Privacy needs to be improved on two fronts in bitcoin:
1. Output values should only be known to the sender, recipient, and anyone they choose to show audit logs to. Validators only have a need to be sure that no inflation is going on, but truly have no business knowing how much was transacted. Confidential transactions achieves this fairly well.
2. The payment graph itself should also only be known to participants and those auditors they explicitly allow. The validators need to know that Alice's output is spent so as to prevent double-spends and allow pruning, and they need to know that Bob has a new output. But any uncertainty about the fact that it was Alice who paid Bob (as opposed to any of the other outputs being spent in that block) would be a welcome improvement. This is what Monero-like ring signatures, or one-way aggregate signatures, or zerocoin/zerocash like proofs provide.
There's still quite a bit of research to be done to validate existing proposals and to gain confidence that one or more of them are ready to be rolled into bitcoin. We wouldn't want to do so too early if there are advances around the corner, or especially not if the system is inherently broken but we don't know because it received inadequate peer review..

Even with a larger block you still need a fee market. Bitcoin cannot support infinite transactions. Developing the tooling for a fee market now allows us to do an emergency growth if it doesn't work, giving us a little bit of engineering headroom just in case we need it.
Growing first and then working on the fee market is playing with fire though, and there's a good chance things could explode if it doesn't work on the first try.

Ah, see the crux of the issue here seems to be that Bitcoin's inherent properties don't seem to be well understood. What is it that gives the Bitcoin asset value, and why do we prefer the Bitcoin block chain over [alternative]( [solutions]( I can assure you that due to architectural differences Stellar and Open-Transactions can scale better than than Bitcoin ever will. And OT has far more expressive smart contracts to boot. So why do I work on Bitcoin Core and why do you and I prefer the use of Bitcoin currency? Because it was first? Network effects?
No. What gives Bitcoin currency and proof-of-work block chains value is their policy neutrality achieved through decentralization. If someone wanted to red list transactions in Stellar or Open-Transactions it would be trivially easy -- you simply threaten the operator of the transaction processing node (e.g. send them a National Security Letter) or the data center which hosts it and have them constrain which transactions get processed. With decentralized mining however things are not so easy. Control over policy requires at minimum 50% of the hash power, and with truly decentralized mining that is difficult to achieve.
This, in a nutshell, is Bitcoin's interesting property: a base settlement layer which even the combined, tyrannical efforts of every state on the planet can not shut down, censor, or influence policy over, short of killing the Internet entirely.
(And if you are long on Bitcoin, it is worth knowing that without this property there is no reason for Bitcoin the currency to exist. When the protocol becomes centralized you might as well use dollars or euros or drachmas, and merchants will love you for it. Bitcoin requires a decentralized currency because a centralized currency would result in central control over an otherwise decentralized protocol. But if the protocol is centralized to begin with...)
Unfortunately we are already trending in the direction of centralization. Did you know that &gt;70% of the hash-power co-locates their block relay nodes in the same U.S. data center? Because latency directly translates into lost revenue. To become more decentralized would involve taking a haircut. Furthermore, the immutability and irrevocableness of Bitcoin is based on the assumption that you or I are running our own nodes and only trusting ourselves. But doing that requires being able to download all the historical data and current blocks, being able to process it in real time, and doing so without breaking the bank or destroying our Internet connections, *and* being able to fall back on p2p anonymous traffic if things go south. Even 8GB blocks would be 1GB of data per day. Would you be willing or able to download terrabytes of historical data, and have dedicated hardware to process it in order to validate you and everybody else's $5 starbucks transactions or $0.01 changetips?

@_date: 2015-08-02 17:00:34
No, it's absolutely nothing like that. What happens is that we lock up funds in a trustless form of escrow, and then peer-to-peer (off-chain) trade agreements on who owns how much of the pot. At some point later we settle by broadcasting a single transaction which takes the pot as input and spends the final allocation to you and me.
So the network sees you and me put 100 coins each into a single 200 coin output, and then a month later we each co-sign on a transaction giving 75 coins to me and 125 coins to you. Two transactions is all that the network sees, but in the mean time millions of high-frequency micropayments could have been going on between me and you.
Technically that describes the micropayment channel. Lightning extends this by letting anyone pay anyone else by following arbitrary paths through the network defined by the graph where nodes are participants and links are channels.
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:24:46
Interaction between fees and block size is complicated. Whether increasing or decreasing the block size results in more fees depends entirely on demand. It is possible to construct hypothetical examples where decreasing the block size results in more fees (e.g. going from infinite blocks to any size less than demand), as well as examples where increasing the block size results in more fees (because more transactions == more fees, perhaps at the same rate if price is inelastic). You will note that there is a steady-state point where further increases will result in less aggregate fees (because the price for all transactions drops), and further decreases also results in less fees because less space == less transactions.
But regardless the argument in general that "miners will set the block size so as to maximize fees" may not carry any weight, even though there is theoretical grounding for such a solution. First, subsidy will dominate fees for years to come, and this greatly distorts the equations. Second, there is almost no visibility into transaction fee demand. At any given point it is anyone's guess as to whether raising or lowering the block size will result in more or less fees, because how much people are willing to pay, if they had to, is not advertised, and variance means data must be collected on too long of an interval to be actionable. Third, there is a general game theory problem. It may be in the interests of all miners to decrease the block size, but so long as there is a higher limit they will make use of it, and therefore no individual miner will signal intent for smaller blocks.
On the other hand, sufficiently large miners *do* have an incentive to increase block sizes beyond safety limits for decentralization because doing so causes their competition to choose between (1) mining stale blocks, or (2) SPV mining empty blocks, giving up fees to the large miner on average. And this effect is likely to far exceed the fee market influences on block size for a long time to come.

I'm on my phone so this will be short. They are basically two issues. First of all it's not constant time, Gavin is simply wrong on that point it is sublinear though. Second, you only achieve the latency reduction that Gavin is approximating to be constant time when you have absolute agreement on policy. In other words when every pool is generating exactly the same block, you get "constant-time" because the protocol is essentially "assume I generated the same block you would have."
This is incredibly dangerous, because it gives a very strong incentive to align with the majority policy viewpoint. If the majority policy is greatest fees that's good. If the majority policy is include only transactions approved by some regulatory authority, that's very very bad. These proposals make censorship much easier to achieve than it otherwise would be, because anyone who is running an anti-censorship node would be at a disadvantage if and when an actual attack occurred.
Greg and Pieter have an alternative that would be policy neutral, but potentially is extremely CPU intensive. (And it doesn't really make sense to get block transmission down to milliseconds if it still takes full seconds to rebuild the block from those packets.) So it's not clear yet if there is an adequate solution in the space. Until there is we should certainly deploy such techniques as we have done with the block relay protocol, but we should make sure that Bitcoin is still workable without them to preserve a plan B in case of attack.

Ideally if both the scriptPubKey and the nValue of the output were serialized into the transaction data being signed, then you wouldn't have to provide the entire transaction being spent in order to prove the output's balance for an SPV signer (read: Trezor-like hardware wallets).
Of course for some stupid reason (ineptitude?) Satoshi didn't serialize the entire output but rather just the scriptPubKey. Honestly I'm not sure what good it does in this case. It is something to fix in a future signing mode, and there have been proposals to do so in the past. It is one of the alterations made to bitcoin in the Elements' Alpha chain.

No, I haven't heard that one before. But I don't think it would solve the issue entirely -- a block could still be invalid, right? For example, think of the recent SPV fork that just happened. You'd really have to know whether the block is valid or not before you start work mining on top of it.
That's creative thinking though, keep it up.

No, they have every incentive to co-locate. LANs have latency measured in microseconds, whereas WAN latency is measured in milliseconds. That directly translates into dollars lost (from higher stale rates) for a pool that does not co-locate. They would stick their work-generating nodes on the same rack if they could coordinate well enough to do so.
The issue is that this effect, although real, is relatively small at 1MB. If the pools could be made to understand the issue they could relocate to have some jurisdictional and geographic coverage while taking only a modest (but noticeable!) haircut with 1MB blocks. But as we increase the block size the effect gets super-linearly worse.

The NACK was to the growth curve. A single, one-time jump to 8MB might possibly be workable, although I do not think adequate testing has been done. [And in fact what testing has been done by other people than Gavin is quite worrysome -- Rusty showed it took approximately 600 seconds in a production environment to relay a 8MB block from a miner in Australia to a set of connected nodes in US/Europe VPSs. That would KILL decentralized mining. The source of this problem was a bug in how bitcoin connection logic interfaces with Linux network buffers that has not been fixed in Core or XT. There are probably other problems to be found too.] But the growth curve is what was unacceptable.
And why are you injecting unrelated questions re: Blockstream into this? That has been covered elsewhere. See the AMA by the sidechain authors, for example.

For a sufficiently large miner it does not make sense to limit the block size. Keep in mind that all while the propagation is going on, they are continuing to mine on top of their large block, as are any SPV miners out there. Thus they have a higher-than-their-hash-rate probability of winning due to the chance of finding the *next* block building off their first giant block.
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:46:50
Decentralization is not about running your own node. Gavin's proposal completely missed the point on that. Decentralization is about policy neutrality. It is about being able to anonymously mine the next block, without bias towards incumbent miners. The set of tradeoffs there is complicated, and empirically a limit we have already crossed.

I have no personal vision for bitcoin. Bitcoin *is* what it is. It is a construct allowed by physical law with properties we discover by experiment, not design in by choice.
Decentralization is the only thing that makes bitcoin interesting, unique, and valuable. This is not some personal judgement, but rather an observation of the facts: without decentralization bitcoin the ledger can be done so much more efficiently (see Open-Transactions or Elements Alpha or Ripple), and there would be absolutely no purpose or basis for the currency.
How much can bitcoin be made to scale without losing the decentralization property from which it derives it's utility? This is an experimental question. It is not a question of how much we want it to scale -- wanting to repeal gravity doesn't get you to the Moon -- it is a matter of how much physical law and present engineering capability allow us to scale bitcoin without transmuting it into something mundane.
This criticism you keep repeating reminds me of an air travel enthusiast berating an engineer for failing to make faster and larger planes, lamenting over the retirement of the Concorde and Space Shuttle, and over the unimpressive carrying capacity of the 787. Well, newsflash: travelling faster than the speed of sound costs a terrible amount of fuel and makes planes require much more maintenance, and medium-sized planes like the 787 are simply more economical for the types of routes that are currently flown. An aviation geek might feel cheated today out of his personal vision of hypersonic air travel that he felt he was promised. Well, deal with it: physical and engineering limits simply didn't allow that vision to come to pass.
So it goes with Bitcoin. There are limits on how much bitcoin can scale on the settlement layer before it is transmuted into something entirely different and uninteresting. It is our job to empirically discover where those limit lay (if we have not already passed them!), and keep the technology within those limits. It is not our job to say "I envision a world where every person on the planet does their daily transactions on the block chain, so let's raise the block size to 100GB." We don't get to decide that. Bitcoin can scale to that level and remain decentralized, or not, and this is an experimental question not a matter of what you or I want or wish. We must instead structure our thoughts like this:
"A decentralized ledger and currency has value. It is something special which has never existed before and which we must strive to protect. In scaling we must determine first how much volume bitcoin can support and remain decentralized, and make sure we never exceed this threshold. As to how many participants and what kind of traffic the base settlement layer will support, that is a result of how much bitcoin can safely scale. It is something we will discover and learn, not choose by fiat."

Figure out (A) how much you would pay to know that the server was compromised, and (B) how much the attacker values access to your server. Usually A &gt; B.

Re: signed blocks, now you're isolating the risk to anonymous, non-conformant miners in an attack/censorship scenario, whose signatures are not trusted (imagine a law or regulatory rule saying that miners can only trust signatures of public keys that themselves have been registered with the regulatory authority).
More generally, if you're willing to go down that route, then why not sign blocks in the first place? Just find reputable miners in many jurisdictions, and make the block header verification a multi-sig of their keys. Most of the scaling concerns with respect to the block size limit would go away, and bitcoin would be able to support orders of magnitude more transactions (fyi, this is essentially how Ripple works).
If you find this objectionable, I'll posit that it is because there is some aspect of Bitcoin I'll call 'decentralization' which you care about, and the the block signing is a hybridization which weakens that property.

There are many bitcoin client implementations. There is and only can be one consensus code implementation. Do you see the difference?

Bitcoin is already centralized. Do you realize that a cabal of a half-dozen people (I'm not talking about the developers) have the power, even if they have yet to exercise it, to arbitrarily control bitcoin? That this power also rests with anyone who controls the networks used by this cabal, which is presently confined to a small number of datacenters? That if they were in the US all it would take is a couple of national security letters for full control over the bitcoin network? I assure you the Chinese government has much stronger strings to pull.
The story of bitcoin over the last two years has been struggling hard to keep bitcoin decentralized in step with wider usage. In this effort we are floundering -- bitcoin scales far better today than it did in early 2013 (at which time it couldn't have even supported today's usage), but centralization pressures have been growing faster still.
That is a story that most people who work on bitcoin scalability can relate to, but which doesn't seem to be commonly understood among the casual userbase.
Why are you interested in bitcoin? Is it simply as digital money? Sorry but bitcoin will never beat the scalability and accessibility of paypal-like solutions, which btw could be upgraded with crypto capabilities (see: opentransactions or stellar).
Perhaps, like me, it because of bitcoin's inherent freedoms? Because you recognize the value of a policy neutral currency, of freedom from manipulation of the macro economy, of the value of sound money, and the trust that comes from building on top of a trustless foundation?
Well every single one of those liberties derives directly from bitcoin's decentralization, and I am not exaggerating when I say that bitcoin's decentralization is hanging by a thread, and trending in the wrong direction. And in the face of that growing pressure, Gavin and Mike want to do something as reckless as grow the block size limit far in excess of what any reasonable expectation of future core tech improvements can provide in terms of counteracting centralization pressures.
My own position is that the block size limit should be raised, but only in step with can reasonably be accomplished with engineering improvements to ensure a decentralized, policy neutral network. There are many in this space working to identify criteria for that, and a couple of different proposals for actually raising the limit in a way that would be more sensitive to these issues. All that we ask for is the time for due process, not ultimatums and hostile forks.


By doing what? I think you imagine us to have more powers than we actually do!


Far from it. A centralized bitcoin provides _plenty_ of utility. Raising the block size is the definition of utility: more people can use Bitcoin, thereby deriving more utility from it. 
The problem is, decentralization is an intangible. It doesn't factor into miner's profit/loss statements, and users don't miss it until after it's long gone. When does the average bitcoin user realize decentralization is gone? When their payment is revoked or KYC is demanded of them. And by then it is too late.

Unfortunately the changes I can think of that would make segwit compatible with the covert ASICBOOST (e.g. sorting the transaction hashes so it is permutation-independent) also adds a lot of engineering work and decreases the utility of segwit because some fraud proofs no longer work.
Given that the only reason to do the covert method is to steal from industry (infringing on patent) and steal from customers (selling inferior configurations than your own self-hosted operation uses), I think the proper response is not to bend over backwards to enable this behavior.

and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."

The problem is you are looking to local comparables to see what you are worth on a global market, but that is comparing apples to oranges.

What happens when Bitcoin Core differs from the description of the consensus protocol?
The key point here -- which is not obvious -- is that Nakamoto consensus relies on replicatable behaviour across an uncountable number of test cases. For every possible transaction or block there is a definitive, canonical answer for whether it is valid or not (non-deterministic behaviour like 0.7 notwithstanding). The only practical way to encode such a diversity of reference cases is essentially "the output of this X86 program run on any Intel/AMD compatible hardware." The consensus code *is* the standard. If there was an ISO Bitcoin standard, it would be an assembly dump of libconsensus with references to the Intel architecture manuals.
It is not, practically speaking, possible to reimplement the consensus code in any other language, because of subtle differences in the behavior of different languages / runtimes. For a simple example, take BIP 42: the original bitcoin client diverged from just about every other implementation in that subsidy reverted to 50 btc after about 250 years. That happened to be a trivial to fix error since it wasn't triggerable until the 23rd century, but it does illustrate a point: Python, Ruby, and Haskell re-implementations of bitcoin copied that subsidy line _exactly as it was written in Bitcoin Core_, but because of differences in how integer shifting out of range is handled in C++ on Intel/AMD vs defined behaviour in these other languages, that same code compiled in a different language produced a different result.
The consensus code *is* the specification.

This is incorrect. There are many ways you can modify the right-side of the transaction tree, not all of which are detectable. I can think of one approach in particular (which I won't post on Reddit for obvious reasons) that is entirely undetectable without knowing the exact mempool of the miner's node a tthe time the block was constructed. It would leave transactions ordered by fee, have no unseen transactions, and therefore look like any other block.
The only real smoking gun for boosting here is empty blocks, which we do see. Although even those can be eliminated with a slight hit to the miner's efficiency.

Because this is not a new idea. This is in fact a very old idea. We included it in the sidechains white paper in 2014 where we wrote about it as a significant risk to bitcoin, a failure mode where miners are able to enforce whatever rules they want on all full nodes. And that appears to be exactly what is being sold to miners now.

Mark Friedenbach of Blockstream (co-founder) here.
The developers chiefly involved with Bitcoin Core, Pieter Wuille and Gregory Maxwell, have written into their contracts the right at any time for any reason quit the company and receive 1yr salary severance pay. The explicit intention of this clause is to remove any leverage the company might have over them should it turn evil and try to influence development. Indeed it sets up the opposite incentive: losing either of these key employees would be very costly to the company, and management at the company understands this and tries very hard to respect the developer's autonomy.
This is all hypothetical, forward-thinking speculation of course. The day to day reality is that we have instilled a culture of everyone, to varying degrees, having two hats at Blockstream: the corporate hat and the open-source contributor hat. Much like the original 20% time at Google, there is a clear understanding that what happens in one domain is kept separated from the other -- we are free to contribute, or not, as open-source developers in the way that we see fit without repercussions. Our CEO, himself a respected cypherpunk, understands this very well. The extra severance clauses that some key employees have is just an assurance against future changes in management direction.

Blocks are not actually perfectly spaced every 10 minutes. You need some excess capacity in order to support the expected periods of heavy loading when blocks just happen to be found very close together. A probably-safe rule of thumb is to operate at 50% capacity. This means that the network needs to be able to support 4MB blocks in order to consider a scaling increase to 2MB. (It is no coincidence that segwit's discounting factor is chosen to allow worst-case 4MB blocks, while 2MB is the expected average.)
By jtoomim's numbers you could even say we're jumping the gun a little bit by increasing to 2MB while only 3MB is safe. But there are some improvements in 0.12 that help cut expected-case validation time considerably, bringing us closer to the necessary 4MB capacity. It'd be interesting to see the benchmarking tests redone on current git master.
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:59:21
As a technological choice it is quite orthogonal to segwit (or the sidechain peg, for that matter). Confidential Assets builds off Confidential Transactions, and inherits the large rangeproof witness, as well as the new surjectionproof witness structure. So CA definitely benefits from the segwit discount. But CA is not something easily deployable to bitcoin mainchain, so it really has nothing to do with deployment of segwit to bitcoin.

How would destroying the whole system gain them access to the underlying assets? I think you are brining other assumptions to the table than I am. If the hypothetical chain has foo-tokens as well as bitcoins, and foo-tokens are more valuable, then equivalent value of foo-tokens in fee will be valued equivalently by the miners. Destroying the block chain will harm the value of foo-tokens as much as it does bitcoin. The situation is entirely symmetrical, and the incentives remain the same.

Sidechains are not a scaling mechanism. They address *zero* of the concerns relating to decentralization, while making the situation worse due to the large size of the sidechain peg transactions. In fact, one of the risks called out in the sidechains whitepaper is that the block size might be too small, or blocks full too consistently to support sufficient movement of funds across the two-way peg. Let me be clear: sidechains are *helped* by larger block sizes, all things being equal.
Blockstream is not offering any product involving off-chain transactions for the purpose of scaling, let alone collecting any fees on it. Indeed the only work we are doing there (Lightning) is explicitly designed to be non-monetizable at the protocol layer.
The argument that Blockstream is crippling Bitcoin to move people onto their own proprietary stack is pure FUD.

Immaturity here means also that new cryptographic assumptions are involved, which have not been as well studied and might not be safe. Some reasonable caution is warranted with respect to pairing crypto.
Also the 8ktps number is a bit misleading.

Block size limits have nothing to do with fees, and everything to do with relay latency, validation cost, and the resulting centralization pressure.
Blocks are full, and will always be full. Full stop. We have long since hit the point where demand for block space grows faster than the block size can safely increase. The era of bumping limits every time we hit them is over.
So what do you do when there is literally not enough space for all the transactions being generated? Either (a) you let everything break -- people's funds locked up by wallets that are incapable of understanding why their low-fee transactions don't get confirmations, EVER; or (b) fee market. The fee market requires both RBF and CPFP (for differing use cases).

Except routing is a pretty much solved problem, so your very first assumption falls flat. Unlike other domains that require trusted routing, LN has the network graph embedded in the block chain itself. The accuracy, integrity, and possibly even completeness of the network graph information is fully verifiable against the block chain / UTXO set. That makes the routing meta information 100% trustworthy, which makes the routing algorithm itself something a junior computer science major could reasonably do as a class assignment. Decentralized routing is a solved problem.

Not to mention selling your customers crippled hardware. Performs as advertised, yes, but miners make their profitability calculations assuming a distribution of energy efficiencies of other miners that turns out to be a deception. People undoubtedly lost money because hash rates rose higher than could reasonably have been predicted based on public information. These people were -- indirectly -- swindled by Bitmain who sold them hardware at prices Bitmain knew wouldn't break even because they'd be outcompeted by Bitmain's own self-mining.

Don't be so sure. A lot of us who got involved around that time (that's a similar price to when I started) know the potential but didn't expect the timeline. The steep and sudden rise in price was without reason and seemed crazy. It still seems crazy.
When I got involved in bitcoin I could buy a thousand with a single paycheck. Of course I didn't because that would be crazy! Who knew if these things were going to keep value, or how many decades it would take. And that was nearly the entire daily transaction volume of an exchange, anyway. But still I had triple-digit holdings, which I sold almost entirely in early 2013. I have a few dozen now in cold storage.
It'd be a sob story except among my cohort it is an extremely common story. Most old timers don't hold nearly as much coins as you would think.

This may come as a surprise to you, but I don't really care much about protecting the value of BTC. Either bitcoin (the currency) has a fundamental value proposition and will stand the test of time, or it doesn't and it won't. I'm not a bitcoin maximalist. The value of Bitcoin (the protocol) is decentralized censorship resistant money and smart contract arbitration. Now either that money is a fundamentally scarce asset, or has a fixed inflationary schedule, or isn't one currency at all but networks of atomically swappable IOUs. I don't care too much either way. What's important is the protocol, not the currency.

Bitcoin's properties are experimentally determined. It is the product of math and the game theory of the economic incentives created by that math. The whitepaper represents a snapshot into the understanding of what Bitcoin is at one point in time, seven years ago.
The system creator wrote both what you quoted and also the expectation that mining would centralize into datacenters. The dissonance between these two statements and the ramification of mining NOT being 1 CPU = 1 vote, but rather 1 hash = 1 vote wasn't really obvious until non-commodity hardware started being necessary to stay profitable.
I highly doubt that the properties of Bitcoin being subject to the control of a couple of people living in an authoritarian country renown for its human rights abuse and selective rule of law, or subject to review by an invite-only meeting behind closed doors is what the system creator had in mind, or what you thought you were getting when you bought Bitcoin.

Segwit more than fully exhausts the entire available capacity in its presently coded form with the 75% discount and 1MB non-witness block size. Already we've compromised by agreeing to a worst-case 4MB block size while experimental evidence shows problems emerging at 3MB (and the compromise of spending our available time on this issue instead of fungibility fixes to the more pressing existential threat of chain analytics and redlisting). So where does that extra capacity come from for the hard fork to be delivered 5 months from now?
By lowering the discount? That reduces the effectiveness of the system by maintaining false incentives and not making use of full capacity available if one assumes a safe buffer.
By having a separate block size limit counted differently than the segwit discount? Now transaction selection is a multidimensional problem that doesn't depend solely on the properties of a transaction in isolation, thereby throwing out all the work that has been done towards making fee policy predictable or even consistent (not to mention the vastly more complicated code).
By simply increasing the block size even though the network doesn't support safely doing so, as a political compromise? What happens when we hit the new limit a few months later? This road leads to political money with none of the user protections Bitcoin currently provides. If Bitcoin's fundamental properties (in this case, it's resilience to block authoring centralization) are subject to negotiated concessions with a centralized entities behind closed doors at an invite-only meeting, then the writing is on the wall.
It also brings all the dangers of a hard-fork for what benefit? My understanding (2nd-hand information) is that the bump being discussed is less than 2MB. If we are going to consciously undertake the risks of a hard-fork, we should use the time available to make changes that more definitively solve the problem, rather than kick the can with a modest bump that would be insufficient even by the time it activates.
The capacity increase roadmap I signed onto is that we will use up existing capacity in a quickly-deployable soft-fork, meanwhile we will pursue technologies which lead to increasing available capacity for safely scaling by larger factors (e.g. technologies which mitigate the negative block relay effects of the Great Firewall), then we measure the increased capacity using objective metrics, and only then do we consider setting dates and details for block size increases. This is data-driven engineering. It leads to optimal solutions and guarantees of safety.
This roundtable agreement is the opposite: it sets dates, then it guesses about available capacity at that time, which informs parameter choices, and an engineering plan is chosen based on what can be accomplished in that timeframe. This is politics-driven engineering. It leads to horribly inefficient design-by-committee solutions and absolutely no guarantees of safety.


We don't have to settle with miners. Miners have no involvement in a hard fork whatsoever. Miners serve the users, not the other way around. If it ever came to be that miners dictated or forced the terms of consensus rule changes, that would be immediate justification for a proof of work change.
As for populist demands, Reddit echochambers do not constitute "the community." There are millions of bitcoin users around the globe, and only a small fraction of them congregate in online fora like this. Actually working with Bitcoin users and attending local meetups gives a very different perspective about what Bitcoin users want...
As for being the least harmful path forwards, I hope the above explains why I feel it is in fact the most dangerous option on the table.

In any case what a fee market does is prevent bitcoin from developing into something that cannot be sustainable without extended subsidies or centralization.


Which is unfortunate because bitcoin cannot support non-existent fees without subsidy. The approaches to fixing that are either break social contract and extend subsidy forever (see: Freicoin), or change bitcoin in ways that violates all its other interesting properties (e.g. block size causing centralization), or accept the fact that bitcoin was never a fee-free protocol and never should have been promoted as such.

I'm quite familiar with the code, thank you. Blocks which are invalid under the consensus rules (e.g. too many signature operations, or too large a block) are rejected, full stop. No amount of hash power can override this. So no, the design of bitcoin is not "bitcoin follows the miners."

It does not preserve backwards-compatibility with segwit on the original chain (indeed, if segwit activates this proposal would become a hard-fork). That's a pretty big deal in my opinion.

@_date: 2015-07-17 08:21:05


Actually, there are. Bitcoin is a consensus algorithm with certain properties that exists in the real world on real computational hardware and real networks. It must obey such constraints such as the speed of light and the need to validate transactions at least once. Combined with present engineering capability, this imposes very real limits on the capability of the Bitcoin network to process ever larger transaction volumes while maintaining the decentralization properties that are the only thing which makes it unique, interesting, and valuable.
The Bitcoin network is not built to support microtransactions. It makes absolutely no sense to pay a miner 10's of dollars to process a 50-cent payment, which is exactly what is occurring right now at the limits of bitcoin scalability. People just don't notice because of the subsidy. But that is changing, both due to halving and rising fee pressure.

@_date: 2016-02-03 17:52:21
Approximately, yes. But note that mining is a Poisson process -- sometimes blocks come fast, sometimes they come slow. We must make sure that the network supports not just the average, amortized cost to validate a block every 10 minutes, but also those periods of time we expect to see every day where blocks are found shortly after each other. There needs to be excess capacity to handle this normal, expected burst loading. A rough engineering rule of thumb is to have double the capacity available as is actually used, on average.
@_date: 2016-02-21 04:46:59
I think that's what the rest of the roadmap, no? We need things like IBLT, weak blocks, and fraud proofs to get more capacity. And we need operational experience to know with any certainty how much of a gain we would get. Then we'll be in a position to know how much of an increase we can safely deploy, with what kind of scheduled increases into the future.

@_date: 2016-02-03 15:39:37
They are mutually exclusive, right now. We had a series of data-driven open workshops exploring this question, and the clear result was that the network can't currently handle more than about 2MB block sizes at this point in time and retain its adversarial protections.
Now if you look to the Core roadmap you'll see a number of research directions mentioned (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks) which are expected to increase capacity. The plan, put simply, is this: use the existing excess capacity to deploy segwit; concurrently research and deploy IBLT, weak blocks, and various other network layer improvements; measure and verify that these technologies have in fact at least doubled the available capacity; deploy a block size increase fork. It is most likely that around this time next year we should be working out the details of a 2MB hard fork on top of the already deployed segwit code.
If I were a betting man, that's the outcome I'd put my money on. But the philosophy of Core is conservative, and we do not feel that we should be betting with the entire Bitcoin economy by committing to a 2MB hard fork in addition to segwit and setting dates before we have even developed and tested the technology that would make it safe to do both. The scenario I outlined above is the most probable outcome with what we know today, but there are known unknowns and probably unknown unknowns that could  interfere with such a schedule. We _think_ that the network could support another doubling after mitigating the effects of the Great Firewall. We _think_ that a combination of IBLT and weak blocks will be able to do that, although no concrete proposal exists as yet. We _think_ that deployment of these technologies will be all that is required to achieve the next level of scale. We think. But all of that is untested, and it would be irresponsible and reckless of us to commit to such an outcome before we actually did our homework.
_Right now_, we are only certain that the network could be safely made to support double its present on-chain capacity with either a 2MB hard-fork or segwit deployment. Of these, segwit is the obvious clear winner as it brings other scaling benefits as well. So we can commit to a schedule for that and do our best to meet that deployment schedule. We have also identified the problems that we believe are holding us back from a further doubling, and possible solutions to those problems which require more research. We can commit to doing the proper research in a timely fashion, and hope that deployment of that technology leads to another capacity doubling. But that's an empirical question, and we can't promise the results!
@_date: 2016-02-27 17:43:14

Please check your facts. The version of segwit in Alpha is not 10 lines of code, nor is the implementation smaller than the soft-fork version that is being proposed for Bitcoin Core. The _only_ difference between the soft-fork and hard-fork variants of segwit is where the commitment is placed, which is of zero relevance to the consensus code and only affects things like fraud proof sizes. The hard-fork variant is actually _more_ work because there's a lot of code out there that calculates depth of the Merkle tree from the number of transactions, and all of that code would have to be reviewed, updated, and tested.

This is a meme that I personally have trouble understanding. I've seen it asserted and repeated, mainly on Reddit, that routing is a unsolved problem, perhaps even unsolvable. It is particularly ironic that these statements are made via the Internet, the largest message routing system to have ever existed. Routing, in general, is a solved problem. We have a half century of experience building routing networks for computers, and dealing with trust issues (see: BGP among other things).
Now you may choose to emphasize the "trustless" part, but I don't think that changes things significantly:
First of all, execution of a lightning payment is allowed to have a trust factor -- you are trusting the other parties to be online and to perform their parts of the protocol when needed. Breakdown of trust here means resorting to an on-chain payment and channel closing. Correct execution of the protocol requires trust, just with the assurance that breakdowns of trust don't result in lost funds. It would be perfectly allowable to have trusted routing, but of course trustless or minimal-trust routing would be preferable (keep reading:).
Secondly, payment channel information is self-certifying. This is the information that is fed into the routing algorithm. Unlike say BGP routing, a lightning node can't invent payment channels that don't actually exist. Each payment channel can be tied back to the block chain. Each link on the route that you construct can be validated. Reputation data can be constructed by showing proofs of prior payment. There is a wealth of verifiable data available, and its the sort of data most routing engineers would metaphorically kill to have.
All it takes is a connection to one honest peer, the same assumption that bitcoin full nodes make, and that is sufficient to ensure that the entire payment channel graph is retrieved and verified against the block chain using a gossip protocol. Routes can then be found locally using any one of the many standard path finding algorithms. I don't know about you, but I would consider this trustless/minimal-trust routing.
One interesting research direction is to see if zero-knowledge routing is possible -- to make a lightning payment without even knowing what nodes it is routed through. I guess that would be the ultimate form of trustless routing, and is something very cool that I think people should be working on. But let me be clear: lightning works just fine without any kind of crazy zero-knowledge router.

For the record, this is not technically true. Anyone can invest in any startup and have privately held stock as a result. This is why, for example, many garage startups have "friends and family" investors in the very beginning, and why there are tales from the dotcom days of pizza deliveries being tipped in stock, etc. However:
(1) there is a limit in how many such unaccredited investors a company can have before it is forced into a different and severely limiting regulatory regime. The limit used to be 500, but it is higher now (2,500?) due to the JOBS act.
(2) Companies are prohibited from *soliciting* investments from non-accredited investors. So I can't put out a reddit ad with "Invest in my company! Limited to the first 2,500 applicants." But if you happen to know I'm starting a company, and approach me with an investment offer, there is a procedure by which I can take your money. This prohibition on soliciting investments is what many ICOs are running afoul of, not the actual issuance of a stock-like token in the first place.
(3) This space for "unaccredited investors" includes former employees that wouldn't meet the accredited investor threshold. So most VCs are wary of investing in a company that has more than a handful of non-accredited investors since it eats into the space available for former employees, which can affect the equity compensation years down the line and/or force a company to go public too early.
(4) Only applies to the USA, of course.

This can be done as a soft-fork it to bitcoin.
For scriptPubKey outputs of the form "&lt;max-42-byte-push&gt;", where the pushed data evaluates as true, a consensus rule is added that the coinbase must pay the rebate, if it is above a dust threshold calculated from the observed min fee for the block, to the push value, which is a serialized scriptPubKey (42 bytes is the largest a native segwit scriptPubKey can be, and all segwit script commitments evaluate as true).
That's it. Fees would be forwarded back to the coinbase by a transaction at the end of the block that claims all these outputs and has a single, zero-valued OP_RETURN output, but this detail needn't be a consensus rule. Aside: if it is a consensus rule though, that OP_RETURN is a good place to put a block header extension commitment.
The largest downside I can see is that this adds ~100 vbytes to the block for each marginal use of the "fee rebate" feature, or around 70 bytes if the rebate is less than the dust threshold. This is compared with native support that could be closer to 30-40 bytes. If every transaction used this, and if transactions averaged 500 bytes, that's 15-20% of the block space spent on explicit fees and fee rebates.
A smaller downside is that blocks may stop using 100% of available capacity, since dropping into a lower feerate reduces the amount of fee already collected. Transaction selection would be batched where you keep selecting the next-highest-paying transaction or package of dependent transactions* until the added fee exceeds what the drop takes away from already selected transactions, then the group is added to the block. If the block size limit is reached before then, the entire group is dropped and the block is a little smaller than usual.
(* Obvious note: in the fee calculation you'd have to treat a package of transactions as one, or child-pays-for-parent breaks this completely.)
Edit: Also, this feature fixes some outstanding fee-related issues or trouble points in multi-party transaction construction protocols, as well as providing sufficient fee for pre-signed transactions like lightning closures without overpaying.
Edit2: Actually I'm not sure that space usage downside is a downside of the proposal per se, just effects how it would be used. Depending on how the dust calculation is done, it is not worth adding a rebate address if you think you are likely to hit or be within, say, ~30% (ballpark estimate) of the actual fee rate, because you _wouldn't_ get any of the excess rebated due to the dust rule. This means most people doing real-time transactions with reliable fee estimators would just use traditional fees and RBF/CPFP. You'd only incur the cost if you are doing something where you don't know what the fee rate should be (e.g. pre-signing a payment channel refund), or don't have sufficient network access to estimate fee (e.g. vending machine that lacks a Blockstream Satellite link).

This is incorrect. Although I can see what you are saying, "IOU" has a meaning in finance that involves a statement of non-collateralized debt. E.g. "I owe you $5, which I don't have." Lightning, as implemented on bitcoin, ALWAYS has the position fully collateralized. It is not a statement of debt (IOU), but a multi-party lock-up-and-trade scheme.

Also, although it is somewhat implied by your  the maximum policy script size remains close to the script limits, rather than limiting the sum of all possible branches.

Although it is noted (briefly) in the tail-call BIP that if the restriction on single recursion, that would be Turing complete [sic] up to script limits (and a soft-fork). Doing so safely would require restructuring how we do transaction weight to be based off a more complicated metric than just size, however.

Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees. The acronym is a bit confusing because although it made sense at time of coining, it has grown as the idea evolved into something else.
An abstract syntax tree is a computer science term for the parsing of a programming language into a tree like structure, where for example an "if" condition would be a parent node and the two branches (if/else) the children. The MAST idea was that if you hash both branches you can then choose to only reveal the branch you take, gaining a possible space savings and more importantly an increase in privacy as observers don't see the other branch. This requires fundamentally restructuring how script is implemented however. 
The idea as it exists now is that you can instead write (or have a tool generate) all possible execution pathways with dead code stripped out, then put those scripts into a Merkle tree in he usual way and just reveal the full script for the pathway you choose to use. This is a rather trivial change and what I propose in the OP.

Commodities go up in value more than consumer price inflation, historically. They go up more than CPI + 0.4%. It's easy to pick dates to show otherwise as the stock market and gold markets are anti-correlated in trends. But overall on a long horizon it is better to hold gold than straight cash.
In 1972, the year after Nixon took the USA off the gold standard, gold had a high price of $70/oz. If you had $70 in 1972 and kept it as cash.. you'd still have $70 today. The price of gold today is $1,279. Had GLD existed and you held it for that time, it'd be worth $1,068. Inflation adjusted dollars means $70 in 1972 would buy $420 worth of stuff today. Holding gold would have increased your buying power 3x over that time, GLD 2.5x. So while the amount of gold you hold goes down over time, the purchasing power still goes up.
(It is interesting to note that investing in 10-year T-bonds would have yielded $1,264, the same within error bars as holding gold directly. But that's not the point of comparison here, as we're talking about GLD vs cash.)
I'm not a goldbug; I prefer investments in equities. But an investment in GLD would be better than cash under the mattress.

Not really any different than any other. Imagine a high-level language that was capable of compiling a lightning payment channel. It would maybe have base data types of signing authorities, time/height, single-use secrets or pre-image hash chains, etc. You could compile such a script to bitcoin script, simplicity, or scriptless-scripts. I see them as interchangeable backends, for the most part.
Edit: which is to say, it's a bit like asking "what kind of language would you use for ARM instead of x86?" The answer is C++, Java, Rust, etc. They'll target both. The situation here IS a little bit different though as the backends have very different properties. Part of my vision for this is that when you write a protocol in a higher-level language, you are going to be specifying really what state transitions are allowed, and how much of that gets translated into script (of any sort) vs checked by a signing authority or something else depends on the back-end used. The backends are not freely interchangeable as e.g. using one might mean you have to have interactive signers vs. checking some property natively in script, but I don't think the languages would be different.

For example, BIP 34 puts the height of the block in the coinbase string, permanently burning 3 bytes of every block. There's no reason to do that. There's entire 4-byte field already in the coinbase tx that has semantics close enough and is entirely unused -- nLockTime. Make a new consensus rule that the coinbase locktime must equal the height, and schedule a HF for years down the line that removes the check on the coinbase string.

It’s more like taproot fully subsumed bitcoin script. We don’t need programmable stack based script interpreters anymore.
But it’ll take time to implement and to transition to that paradigm. In the mean time MAST enables a lot of new use cases today for infrastructure built off current script. So yeah, there is no reason we can’t do both.
Edit: also I seem to be horribly misquoted in the article (I was not consulted or aware of it). I have never argued against taproot.

Or you can factor in the full cost of repayment and credit yourself for the money saved, for that psychological win. Point is it’s not a binary choice, it’s a bit strange that the whole community for the most part encourages a non-rational behavior.
And it’s meant is just an example of non-rational behavior. There are others. The community also celebrates becoming debt-free. However for the last 10 years it has been true that if you were not using the maximum amount of secured borrowing available to you such as car loans and mortgage, especially first mortgages, you were leaving money on the table. For Americans at least. The first mortgage case is a particularly good example. If you itemize your deductions and you have a good credit, and you put the cash out money into absolutely risk-free investments, Your net interest would be less than half a percent, and a few points it was even negative. For most people stated risk tolerance is a very healthy profit could have been obtained on cheap margin. And I’m not talking about investing in bitcoin, just very conservative mixes of bonds and index funds.
It’s a bit hypocritical of a community to recommend minimizing debt in one breath, and then suggest a strategy they know to not be optimal at achieving that goal. Or to preach moderate risk (index funds) and then not pursue low risk methods of achieving leverage.

I think what u/rinko001 is saying, in his or her own unique way, is that while having widespread access to miners is a laudable goal, the reality is not a simple as certain PR/hype machines have presented it to be. Specifically "ASIC resistance" is impossible in the strongest sense: you can always make an ASIC for something, and it will always be N times faster than a general purpose system, where N depends on the task. Maybe for eth's proof of work N is a lot smaller (but still &gt;1) than it is for bitcoin, meaning an ASIC gets you a smaller win over GPUs than it did for bitcoin, but this is hardly obvious and it doesn't gain you anything in the long run. An expensive to design and make ASIC just makes it more centralizing when it is finally built. Scrypt inventors claimed exactly the same thing, and it turned out that scrypt miners could be made way more efficient due to heat dissipation over their larger cores. Go figure.
It boils down to: you CANNOT make something ASIC resistant. That's like claiming a solution to the halting problem or perpetual motion. And yes, it tends to rub certain people the wrong way, myself included, when your money-driven hype machine is pushing such a narrative. It's called selling snake-oil.
You can read some more ASIC resistance and the theory of mining in a FAQ put together by one of my colleagues and available here:

I'm not so sure. To your specific example this is basically a redoing of P2SH, so if it gets adopted then it's clear proof that script can evolve by getting consensus on proposals that revisit design decisions.
There are clear advantages to both proposals. Schemes of the mold of BIP114 save at least 8 vbytes (32 witness bytes) per input, likely more in the full accounting. That's a marginal but positive benefit. The tail call scheme on the other hand enables permissionless innovation in the form of user specified hashing for the policy script, making it ultimately more flexible.
There is room for both. I think we should roll out tail call semantics as soon as it is possible, and then after seeing it in use finish the design of a new script version that codifies the common use case as a space efficient template.

That's exactly how replays work -- you transfer the coin on chain B to the exchange, sell it, get money back. Only while you were not paying attention someone broadcast (replayed) your transfer from chain B onto chain A, and now your more valuable coins are sent to the same place you sent the other ones.
Only problem is, there's no guarantee the exchange is watching that address on chain A, that the key isn't locked in some HSM (which would be best practice) preventing them from extracting it for use on chain A, or that the exchange operator doesn't just abscond with the more valuable chain A funds.

The more interesting result of RSOP (which has been considered by the bitcoin developer community already) is that it allows mempool synchronization using weak blocks, with a cost to fabricating commitments, and that it helps protect against transaction censorship.
However it has real practical problems to deployment, and unfortunately fixes the metric for fee calculation in such a way that the transaction selection rule cannot be easily updated (though this may be fixable if you allow future upgrades to look like censorship to old nodes).

They wouldn't. This isn't an accident. A mistake, maybe. Do what you would do if you found an envelope with eight $100 bills on your doorstep. If it were me I'd make an honest good-faith effort to find out who sent the funds and why and try to return them. Failing that I'd sit on the funds for a while in case it takes time for someone to sort out their mistake. Failing that.. well you did what you could; the money's yours. Donate it to charity if you don't want to spend it.
Also, make extra certain it is not YOU that "sent" the funds by mistake. Change address from a wallet backup, maybe?

Well applicants very rarely withdraw their applications unless they are given the heads-up, informally, that it is going to be rejected. The ability to withdraw is a face saving thing. So the fair (but not certain!) assumption is that the SEC found a reason not to approve it. Was it your letter? Who knows. But you laid out the case very plainly, and unlike many other comments you addressed an aspect that is relevant to the SEC's consumer protection role and concrete rather than abstract. So I'm sure it played a part, if they weren't aware already. That's a good thing IMHO as we want to build the best bitcoin ecosystem we can -- we need to take the long view, not what might bring a short term price increase.

Here's the most useful application of MAST, when combined with a signature scheme supporting key aggregation: it make every single multi-party smart contract, no matter the complexity, look exactly the same as a simple payment in the case of cooperative closure, and even the fall-back paths in some contracts too.
Your multi-key 2FA hardware-wallet vault? Looks like a regular wallet payment. Your lightning channel closure? Also looks like an everyday payment. The resolution of a complicated N-party international supply chain contract? Looks like a simple payment.
Neither miners, nor analytics companies, nor anyone else can "see" what the underlying contract was, so long as the parties were online to sign the cooperative close-out. And in most cases they don't learn much in the uncooperative case either -- many interesting contracts are just long chains of pre-signed "CHECKSIG" (cooperative) or a lock-time + CHECKSIG for the failure/fall-back modes. Standardize on a common lock-time schedule and those look the same across different contracts too.

You setup a "checkbook IRA", or the Roth equivalent, and ultimately end up with a checking account in the name of some LLC that you are the manager of that holds all the funds rolled over from your 401k, minus a few thousand in fees. You then register with your favorite exchange or local bitcoins and buy coins like you normally would, just being careful to keep funds separate and never EVER mixing personal &amp; IRA-held accounts. Also can't buy things from yourself, people you're related to, your employer, or buy collectables (no Casascius coins!), etc. Google "self-dealing restrictions."
EDIT: Obligatory I'm not a tax lawyer warning, and tread especially carefully here because "checkbook IRAs" are a loophole that the IRS and tax courts haven't made rulings on yet.

It's not an either-or. The kind of scripting capability that is presently possible with MW is not very expressive. You can do some multi-party signatures, hash pre-images, some time-locks, and that's about it. To be fair, that encompasses most of what people use bitcoin for though! But the realm of smart contracting is quite large and there are many things that are not so easily reducible to the world of EC primitives in MW's scriptless-scripts, or which need non-interactivity in the creation of program signatures.
In addition, approaches such as Simplicity are valuable for more than just a replacement for bitcoin script. It is also a means by which you can implement and prove runtime bounds over, say, new modular consensus code, or signing oracles, or other applications.
When it comes to script though, ultimately this is not the level at which people will likely write contracts. You have two machine languages here: the MW scriptless-script machine, and the Simplicity machine. Both are better than bitcoin's built-in scripting system. All of them kinda suck to program directly. We're likely to see higher-level languages still, hopefully with verified compiler semantics so we can be assured that programs written on the high level behave as we think they do when compiled down to MW and Simplicity primitives.

I imagine the high-level language is not specifying transaction validation requirements directly, but rather specifying the overall protocol for off-chain interactions. It would be a state-machine language where movement between states requires some form of interaction with the other participants, the practical result of which would be a new set of channel-closure transactions spending the UTXOs that hold the locked up assets for the contract, atomically invalidating the old closure transactions in the process.
Of course part of the "standard library and runtime infrastructure" for such a language would be templates for doing these state updates using the primitives available at the assembly layer. And a smart compiler might also use expressiveness of the underlying script, when available, to save interaction steps or minimize failure modes when there is some condition that can be checked directly in script rather than requiring a signature from everybody to affirm they verified the value themselves.
Actually maybe that's an important observation I glossed over: any complex script validation using a fixed set of participants can be substituted by "all the parties involved checked themselves and signed off on it." So as long as the underlying assembly layer supports signatures and the timelock and secret revelation gizmos needed for trustless state updates (colloquially, payment channels), then any script can be executed host-side on the participant's machines and the results are visible to the block chain only as signatures and secret revelations.
The class of things this does not work for things like decentralized sidechain pegs, however, where the number of participants is neither small nor fixed nor known in advance.


I'm not sure the structure is important at the highest level. That's just a forced revelation of a secret, which could also be, say, a hash preimage in bitcoin script or simplicity. A protocol can be specified at the level of signers &amp; secret-holders, like cross-chain atomic swaps, and then compiled down to either bitcoin script with ECDSA sigs and hash preimage checks, or MW scriptless scripts with its multi-party signing protocols.

I like to think that I know what I'm talking about, but maybe I'm mistaken.
You see, the thing is that not every payment needs to hit the block chain. Techniques like micropayment hubs allow payments to occur off block chain at effectively unlimited volume, with only periodic settlement transactions hitting the chain. With widely deployed micropayment channels there is no reason that 1MB blocks could not serve any reasonable level of global payments, assuming no other competing uses for the block space.
Sidechains also provide a releaf valve of sorts, allowing people to opt in or out of larger block chains, with only those using the chain putting their funds at risk.
Within a single chain there is a very real tradeoff between block size and centralization pressure. Every added megabyte pushes out small scale miners, high latency links, or low bandwidth connections. It is already at the point where it is borderline infeasible for me to run a full node at home behind my 1Mbps DSL link because of its effect on my family's internet performance. Any increase in the block size would make running a full node infeasible for people like me. That should be very, very alarming.
So no, I don't think it is at all clear that the block size *has* to be raised, much less that it should be done "the sooner the better," or that it would be short sighted to refuse a hard fork now.

Network block coding means that blocks can fit in a single TCP packet, pretty much irregardless of size, if a miner is playing along. And if a miner purposefully wants to delay a block they can do so in ways orders of magnitude more expensive than bandwidth delays.

I will not try for an exhaustive list, just what comes to mind as I type this in the few minutes that I have:


Faster / near-instant transactions. In lightning because once the payment is arranged it is done; block chain is only used for settlement of payment channels. In the case of open transactions, the server is continuously validating and timestamping transactions; you only have to wait as long as it takes for the server to process the queue, ideally less than a second if there isn't a backlog.
Higher throughput (than bitcoin). In Lightning only parties are involved, in open transactions there isn't a consensus algorithm being used. That means much higher throughput before scaling limitations are reached.
Relatedly, micropayments. Fees are small in both cases because supported volume is large.


Open Transactions adds trust in the server operator; Lightning retains the same decentralized, minimal trust properties that bitcoin has, because Lightning _is_ bitcoin.
Lightning scales with the number of participants. Open Transactions scales vertically with the size of the server. These are different scaling tradeoffs that lets lightning scale better 'by default' unless significant resources are invested into making OT scale horizontally.
Lightning can involve transactions crossing multiple networks. Open Transactions requires that they first be pegged into the same server (cross server transactions are done by both servers having accounts on the other).

There are some hybrid approaches that have various trade-offs but there is as of yet not a solution that works under all circumstances. Tradeoffs do exist when choosing a side chain solution. Nevertheless it doesn't prevent side chains from being useful in practice under various circumstances.

That's a very one-sided view of history that is entirely ignoring the role that UASF played. UASF gained a _significant_ amount of momentum in the final weeks, making a chain split inevitable. NYA happened as a face-saving way for miners and businesses to follow UASF without actually doing so, officially. The rest of the world said "we're forcing segwit on Aug 1st, end of story" and the companies involved in NYA completely capitulated, while finding a way to keep it from looking that way.
There's clear evidence for this too. The text of the NYA is _incompatible_ with BIP 148. After being resoundly rejected and ridiculed by developers and the community the implementation was changed to BIP 91 which is indistinguishable from UASF. A face-saving closed-door agreement was rejected, so a second face-saving move was made to retroactively claim that the agreement was actually what was going to happen anyway.
It takes some real mental gymnastics to twist that into us, the bitcoin users and developers, having ever agreed to NYA in the first place.

By broadcasting the transaction on a publicly auditable medium? Better hope you're exercising perfect coin control.
@_date: 2015-09-13 04:50:42
Did you see Matt's relay network talk? Empirical evidence right now is that most blocks fit within 1-2 TCP packets. That's with out much concern at all for keeping minimal network coding. With careful engineering this criteria of fitting a block into 1 TCP packet can be maintained pretty much irregardless of actual block size. Furthermore, some modifications to the bitcoin daemon would skip validation time as well since such blocks could be pre-validated (or at the very least, the expensive transaction validity checks could be completely cached). If this would be done then there would be no correlation between block size and propagation time.

@_date: 2015-09-05 20:44:44
Here's a thought experiment: replace proof of work in Bitcoin with block signing. Now block is valid if it follows all the rules of Bitcoin, which includes finite monetary supply, but some other external consensus mechanism is used for selecting transactions to include in the block which is signed by one party. This can easily scale to thousands of transactions per second, and any party is able to audit the block chain that is produced. Part of that audit is to make sure that monetary supply is finite.

This is essentially my viewpoint as well. However u/110101002 is right in that a one megabyte block is really at the threshold of what the Bitcoin network can safely support right now. However the reason is that block size does not correlate perfectly with resources used in a block. It is possible to construct a block which is purposely designed to be difficult to validate even within the constraints of the one megabyte block. What we need to do is switch how we are measuring resource usage from block size to some linear function of actual resources consumed. We can then support effectively 4MB or 8MB blocks when filled with normal transactions, or 1/2 megabyte or less of DoS blocks. I'll be giving a talk on this at the Montreal workshop.

To be clear those differences are not exactly the same as what I'm getting at. Those teachers' accents reflect their home dialects, so it's a bit like noticing french, german, and dutch speakers having different accents in English. True, but just the tip of the iceberg with respect to the actual differences between their native tongues.
That said, there are quite a few who speak Mandarin at home, especially in the cities, because their parents come from different regions and it's a common language, or they choose to do so to give their kids a head start, etc. Given your teachers are higher educated and live abroad, I wouldn't be surprised if they were all or nearly all in this group and would say they spoke Mandarin growing up, not their home dialect. But that's not representative of the average poor to middle class Chinese household, especially outside the megacities.

because industrial Bitcoin can be tracked down regulated coerced subverted and ultimately made to conform to all the evils that are wrong with the current financial system. right now however Industrial Bitcoin is merely a gateway to the true network which is decentralized, however what you suggest would make Industrial Bitcoin the true network and the decentralized portion merely a gateway to the fully centralized, controllable network.

Supermajority doesn't matter. The unpatched nodes left behind think they are 100% of the hash power, because the patched nodes are crazy people who don't know the consensus rules. You could argue against scenario B by stating that it involves zero conf transactions, but in fact there will be confirmations because not all miners will upgrade. There will still be a superminority of unpatched, autopilot miners pushing out old blocks at a reduced rate, say 1 every 2 hours. So you could still pull off a double-spend in the span of a day, which is a reasonable threat.

What's going on in the block size distraction today is one very important thing: everyone is paying attention. Even those who can't review code are nevertheless being widely read and forming their own opinions. As painful as it is, this is how a hard fork _should be_ (although perhaps with less acrimony). Forking changes, and especially hard fork changes, _should_ be the most widely reviewed changes to bitcoin protocol.
Why do we do fire drills? So that when a fire drill happens we each do mechanically what is required of us without thought. The last thing we want is to have users indoctrinated into a procedure for handling hardforks, institutionalizing acceptance without review: mechanical deployment without thought.

This is sadly normal. Perhaps a little bit slower than average for that hardware and connection, but within expected variance. And, as Patrick has shown, the problem will only get worse as time goes by.
I would try to keep it running continuously. Perhaps let it run overnight. There is probably some time wasted each time you turn it on waiting to connect to peers with enough upload to send you blocks fast enough to saturate your connection. Turn it on, let it run while watching your network bandwidth until you see large numbers. Kill and restart if after 10 minutes or so you still are only getting a trickle of blocks (you may have unluckily maxed out connections on slow peers).
Also, open port 8333 and get your firewall to route it to your bitcoin node. You will receive A LOT more connections in this way.

Zero-fee transactions are charity. They are cheap to include only so long as they are not displacing paying transactions. I fully expect 0 fee transactions to disappear entirely.


You seem to be entirely missing the point. _It will never be possible to increase the block size by enough to support every single one of everyone's transactions._ Bitcoin with GB or TB sized blocks would not be bitcoin. It would be de facto centralized and carry forward none of bitcoin's inherent freedoms or value as a currency.
So if it is not possible to increase the block size by enough to support all future transactions, then a RBF/CPFP fee market is inevitable.
To your other points, those are UX concerns. People don't have to review their transactions every few minutes as their wallet software can automate that for them. People who aren't able to wait a few blocks will pay correspondingly higher amounts for their fees to ensure rapid confirmation.


Since lightning is able to handle thousands of transactions off-chain for every on-chain channel update, I'm having trouble parsing what you mean here.

I don't know enough about ethereum to comment. But as I mentioned above it is a general result that proof of stake does not work as a substitute for proof of work in Nakamoto consensus, regardless of the complexities of any particular proposal.
Where proof of stake is interesting is in things like coordinating policy decisions by miners outside of consensus, or unravelling the peg of a sidechain. But not in the creation of blocks per se.

1MB blocks. This centralizing effect is basically negligible (less than 1%) for full blocks, and GHash wasn't making full blocks back then.
Grow the block size to even 8MB and you start seeing effects on the order of your typical miner's profit margins.
Grow much larger than that and the stable outcome is a single server selecting transactions for all the blocks :(

Eh? No, it's the opposite. Filing a provisional costs ~$100 and doesn't require much legal or engineering work. Filing a non-provisional application costs something like $400, plus an order of magnitude more for the maintenance fees, plus greater legal and engineering time.
The provision is _meant_ to give you a year to file an actual application, but what it also does is stick your prior art in a database the examiners are guaranteed to check (sadly it is often all they check). And it stays there, forever. So the provisional patent, with no followup application, is actually a really cheap way to establish prior art, and the fact that provisionals aren't made public doesn't really matter (you can always publish via mailing list as well).

Ah! We get to Bitcoin's one distinguishing property: trustlessness. But it is only truatless if you actually audit the chain youtself with a full node.

@_date: 2015-09-06 22:21:05
The centralization argument really has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin. If the price goes up, difficulty will go up -- so long as there is subsidy (in a post-subsidy world, fees will go down). Mining is a race to zero profit margins -- if there exists profit to be made, new miners will be spun up until the difficulty adjustments minimize that profit to approximately zero.
An example of a centralization pressure, on the other hand, is that as block sizes increase, the 'relative hashpower' of larger miners increases disproportionally. This is because they have near-instant relay to their own mining nodes, but other miners must spend increasing amounts of time (proportional to the block size) to validate their blocks. Fancy relay algorithms get around this, but _only with cooperation of miners_. Expecting such cooperation is naïve when miners have a direct, profit-boosting disincentive to cooperate. This centralization pressure is not affected by price.
@_date: 2015-09-13 06:36:49

Eh, I wouldn't go so far. The original vision of ripple was in fact quite different, not a consensus system at all. This may not have seen practice but there was an idea that accounting would be distributed such that each issuer you tracked their own ledgers, and there would be some distributed commit mechanism for transactions across ledgers which didn't require global consensus. It was quite a cool idea but really had nothing to do with the open coin model. And that's without getting into how we open coin system treats all IOUs redeemable for the same currency as the same asset....
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:35:23
Someone (Adam?) invented the term "write-cache layer" for lightning, and that is a much better description than "off-chain"... if you have the relevant computer science background to understand.
Write caching is what your operating system uses to speed up file system operations. When a program uses a normal system call to write to a file, the operating system basically says "yeah, yeah! I'll do that later" and returns back to the program, keeping a reminder in RAM to eventually write that data to disk. At some point down the line when the disk is available, the operating system writes data data, as requested. This benefits file system performance in a couple of different ways, e.g. by allowing the operating system to write blocks out of order when it is opportunistically able to do so. But the relevant part to the lightning analogy is that future writes to the same data only hit RAM in the time between the first requested write and when it is finally committed to disk.
To explain by example: a file system with a 4k block size can only write data to disk 4k at a time. Now imagine a program which wipes 1MB file in a stupid way by overwriting it with zeros, one byte at a time. Without a cache, this program would read the first sector from disk, overwrite the first byte, and write the full 4k back to disk. It will then zero out the 2nd byte, and write the 4k block back to disk again. At the end of the day this results in 4GB of data being written to disk, across ~1M I/O calls, with a running time on the order of minutes or hours even on a modern PC.
With a write-back cache under typical conditions, even this stupid, file-system ignorant file wiping example program would only need to write 1MB to disk with 250 or fewer I/O operations, taking less than a second of runtime. The reason is because the first time it is requested that a block be written to disk the operating system says "yeah yeah, I'll do it later!" Then while the disk is seeking, the program goes ahead and writes the 2nd byte, and the 3rd, and so on. Because disks are really slow, chances are that by the time the operating system is able to seek the disk to the right position for the block, the program has already finished wiping the final 4096th byte of the block and moved on to the next. So the OS writes only the latest copy from the cache, essentially "compressing" 4k writes into a single I/O. Additionally, it doesn't really make sense to say that the program "isn't using the file system" because there's a cache in-between. It's still making file system operations, it's just that the operating system is choosing to not perform unnecessary I/O. (Aside: the programmer maintains the right to do a stupid, slow, uncached I/O when she really knows that is what she needs, e.g. for atomic transaction commitment in a database context.)
And so it goes with lightning: once a channel is setup, the participants exchange money back and forth by composing close-out transactions. Lightning transactions *are* bitcoin transactions. However just like the operating system chose not to write to disk right away, the two end nodes of a channel choose not to broadcast their close-out transactions immediately -- "yeah, yeah! I'll broadcast those later." As time goes by, they decide to transact with each other again, and rather than add another transaction on the chain they instead just replace the existing close-out transaction which is sitting around in the cache, unbroadcasted. The original close-out transaction is filed away or deleted entirely, and the new one takes its place waiting to be broadcast. This is like the OS seeing the 2nd or 3rd write to the same file system block and just swapping out the data in the cache and profiting from not having to write the same block twice.
A program using the file system through a cache is still using the file system. A wallet using bitcoin through the lightning network is still composing bitcoin transactions and using the bitcoin block chain -- it's just choosing to cache transactions before broadcast to gain efficiencies (less aggregate fee, instant transactions, etc.).

How do expect a fee market to work? At some point someone undershoots and has to replace their transaction with one giving a higher fee if they want reasonable confirmation time. The complexity of replace by fee is a fact of life. There is no getting around it so long as there is a fee market.

Why do you think a settlement layer would only be accessible to banks and wealthy individuals?

That is one model for how lightning develops. There are other alternatives which the technology allows. Rusty has written recently on the Blockstream blog about the possibility of nodes directly peering with random other nodes on startup to have a more decentralized graph.
But even if the hubs end up being big entities, they are just providing the liquidity to make the payments. A spoke on a hub-spoke graph is just as able to participate and doesn't require large capital outlays.

For that reason? No. The block size limit provides protection against centralizing pressures that would, if left unchecked, turn bitcoin into something entirely undesirable. We should increase the size of bitcoin blocks to the extent we can while preventing such bad outcomes. But the maximum acceptable block size is not a function of how many transactions can fit inside it, or how many people it allows to use the chain directly.

There was a perfectly good alternative: BIP 17. Gavin "threw his weight around" and picked his own BIP 16 when he got impatient waiting for consensus. I believe that if we had even a few months more review we would have caught the push limitation and either re-written BIP 16 or used BIP 17 which did not suffer that flaw.
So it is with the block size debate today. There _are_ alternatives to BIP 101, and we have a responsibility to take the necessary time to evaluate all possibilities before doing it right.

It is a different meaning of compression that is being used here, although I can understand the confusion. The compression we are talking about is not broadcasting transactions at all. So there are a thousand transactions that happen off chain, and the end result is 2 settlement transactions that hit the chain. It is not the type of compression that you think of when talking about compressing files or network connections.
So in the ideal case we have one transaction that sets up the payment channel, then countless numbers of transactions that don't actually hit the chain, then one transaction to settle the channel when it's time to close. In the settlement transaction just have the net difference in Bitcoin at the end of the day.

The world wide web is an information-delivery system. It is centralized by design (see: client-server architecture).
If by Internet you actually meant global unfiltered TCP/IP network connections, then kudos to you for being accurate. And indeed I would posit that a true monopoly on Internet access -- especially if it came with filtering and/or widespread surveillance -- would be something people object to. Thankfully there are people now such as the EFF who advocate for a free Internet.
Bitcoin is a payment network and a currency. There would continue to be demant to use a bitcoin-like payment network if it became centralized, but there'd be no point in some aspects of the system, e.g. mining. If you're willing to accept centralization then Bitcoin could be made way more efficient.
But with a centralized payment network, there is no reason to use Bitcoin the currency. Just transact with dollars instead! It's much easier and less of a headache for everyone.

At the end of the day we just have to work with what the technology allows. Bitcoin is not and never would have been a good platform for high-volume micropayments, if not for the fact that bitcoin's costs have throughout its history been obscured by subsidy.
Part of the disconnect is that much of the community is focused on what they want bitcoin to be, whereas the developers are constrained by what bitcoin actually can be, at this point in time.

Good for you. But the number they chose was the fairest -- they took the CoinDesk average price, as well as currency exchange rates for the day that MtGox went bankrupt, or thereabouts.
Yes, MtGox's own price was lagging far behind, so it may end up being that you don't lose too much from this deal. Someone using BitcoinBuilder at the very last moment might even turn a profit.
But I wouldn't fault the system for that. What actually happened is someone else with goxbtc decided that it was in their best interest to sell at a discount and offload their coins to you at a fraction of their fair market worth, if the market had been fair. You profited not from MtGox's bankruptcy trustee, but from the actions of another now-divested MtGox client.
If MtGox's bankruptcy trustee had picked any other price then those holding bitcoins would rightfully have called foul. Because someone holding bitcoins on the exchange which were bought at fair market value shouldn't be penalized.

If I'm a miner, why would I not fill the block with paying transactions?


"We" have no control over the number of people wanting to use bitcoin, nor the amounts or frequency they desire to transact. In fact we have already filled blocks up in a way -- if transactions were free and available then services like ChangeTip would be on-chain. No matter what reasonable block size you pick, there will be excess demand for that space. Bitcoin is used for a lot more than PayPal's particular niche.

I'm a miner with more than 30% hashpower. I fill my block with unannounced junk after the paying transactions. I announce my blocks when I find them but distribution is delayed due to the need to upload and validate my new junk transactions at each hop. IBLT does not help here.
My hashpower is magnified for basically the same reasons as selfish mining. Whether the competition SPV mines on my headers, or waits until they validate, I win. The larger the allowed block sizes, the larger the effect.
In an adversarial situation you don't have to have real demand to fill blocks and see the adverse effects of block size on decentralization.

Micropayment hubs are not centralized services of the sort like Paypal or VISA. You can easily construct payments such that there is only a very small amount of float held by the hub at any time, and still transact in crazy high balances. Want to send $500? Do it by making 50 $10 payments through the hub. Each added payment costs only a round trip transmission and a signature.
And in the hub model it is not a requirement that every account settle. You could have accounts settle once a month, or even delay indefinitely until it is actually needed or a risk threshold is crossed. So no, it's not at all obvious to me that 5-10 transactions per second can't handle global payments.
I said nothing about storage costs in my post. My argument was about *bandwidth* and *latency* effects, which are very real. And we should handicap a *decentralized* network to run at the speed of its slowest participant. Because otherwise it wouldn't be accessible to them and they'd be forced to rely on a centralized gateway, making the network no longer decentralized for them. Should someone on a 1Mbps home DSL line be able to run bitcoind? I think the answer is yes. If we get to the point of needing a data center connection to run a bitcoin node, then I seriously question what the point is, and what benefit is being gained over straight identification of the players and a traditional consensus model.

Your patch (included in XT) limits bytes hashed in the same way that we limit checksigs and size. That addresses the problem, although I remain concerned that introducing one more aggregate limit greatly complicates surrounding infrastructure code, such as optimal transaction and coin selection algorithms.
The alternative presented in the talk is to have a single aggregate limit that is a linear function of these parameters. This allows for much more consistent block validation times under both average and worst case assumptions.

Elements alpha works on testnet today.
Payment channels (the core of lightning) works with minimal, non-zero trust today. A zero trust soft-fork is already in the pipeline.
What forks give side chains and lightning is better capabilities. But it is also very important to note that these changes are soft forks not hard forks. That is a big difference.

I do not agree that forced soft forks (an old idea) are better than hard forks. Like soft forks it has the disadvantage of forcing the will of the majority onto the minority, which I believe to be antithetical to bitcoin's ethos.

No, to stretch the analogy the argument for a hard fork is more like "let's scrap IP altogether and move everyone to something new." Whereas I'm saying there are opt-in alternatives that we can use (e.g. NAT mapping and IPv4&lt;--&gt;IPv6 bridges) that allow us to safely transition as needed.

F2Pool will have a 5%, 10%, 20%, growing advantage over you.

Voting is fine when all the people affected by the outcome have franchise. A miners vote, on the other hand, is oligarchical rule by a select few, not democracy.

You send Bitcoin to yourself with the maximum block height equal to the next block and immediately send to someone else. Both confirm. Now you reorg the blockchain by one block or whatever is necessary to undo the first transaction to a fork that does not include the expired transaction. The second spend can no longer make it on the chain. When confronted you say you got the coins from someone else, and there's nothing you can do.

Sorry to be obstinate, but I really am not understanding what the analogous read operation is. Checking the balance of a channel? Verifying that a transaction occurred? In this analogy the write operation is the operation of making a payment. What is the real equivalent of that? I'm not sure this makes sense. (It is a descriptive analogy, one can't expect it to match perfectly in every little detail.)

The reality is that we have learned quite a bit about how decentralized ledgers work since 2009, and it is simply not possible to scale to desired levels of usage with every transaction on chain and with negligible fees while maintaining strong guarantees about policy neutrality. With presently available tools that is the crypto protocol equivalent of a perpetual motion machine. You can have all the intent you want, but it is not going to help you circumvent the constraints of real world.
The bitcoin whitepaper describes Nakamoto consensus as an algorithm for achieving decentralized, anonymous consensus over the ordering of transactions. We now know that unconstrained increases of the block size will inevitably result in the loss of decentralized and anonymous mining, thereby defeating the design criteria explicitly enumerated in the bitcoin whitepaper. So by all means, keep referencing Satoshi's intent. It's not helping your case.

Yes, CT on bitcoin is a desirable end goal. I would like that as well. But as of yet, there no BIP or pull request to look at in order to analyze what changes would be required to make CT soft-fork compatible, and what trade-offs those changes would have.
CT, as implemented on the Alpha release of sidechain elements, is optional at the protocol level, even though the wallet assumes its use. That is to say it is perfectly possible and allowed to have regular old explicit inputs and outputs in a transaction on Alpha, and have the benefit of smaller transactions (at the cost of less privacy).
Because Alpha was starting from a clean slate, and because the expected transaction volume was much less, we were able to turn CT on as the default. This was a purposeful decision to reflect our principles by supporting private-by-defalut settings. But in a hypothetical roll-out to Bitcoin Core, there's no reason to assume that every single transaction would suddenly become a CT transaction. And indeed that would break _a lot_ of infrastructure if that were the case.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:46:27
There will always be a block size limit. And we will always have full blocks. That is a simple reality of Bitcoin. There is absolutely no way that Bitcoin can scale to handle thousands of transactions per second with blocks gigabytes in size, and still retain any of its interesting properties and freedoms. This is fact.
So the question is what do we do in the face of an inevitable fee market with full blocks? I'd love to hear your alternative if you have one.
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:36:42
It makes sense in that context because the distributed system is typically run by one party. So it makes sense that one party would want to minimize the amount of equipment they need to have. But in Bitcoin, each node is presumed to be owned by someone else. So it in fact makes sense that if you have N people using bitcoin that you have N validators duplicating work. Any one of the validators is only doing their own work.

Well I'm not sure what there is to respond to.. I did respond to the one factual error I saw in my brief read of it.
It's basically an enumeration of the current state of the art in building high-availability, distributed systems and achieving high scale in datacenter operations. Yep, we're aware of that research! Would help more if someone stepped up and wrote code.
Of course note that just because you could make bitcoind distributed / sharded and scale it horizontally over a datacenter, or increase block sizes to the point of saturating inter-datacenter links, that doesn't mean you *should*. Distributed != Decentralized. So I think there are some philosophical misunderstandings about what bitcoin is in the long-term vision. But the specific things being pointed to are fine things to work on.

Feedback for the author: your description of the relay network is incorrect. The relay network isn't like a CDN at all.

This is pretty much the correct answer right now, for me at least. It may be that the network could support a slight increase after segwit - there has been a tremendous amount of engineering work done on scaling since this time last year (FIBRE, compact blocks). I was somewhat disappointed that no one submitted an update talk to the analysis that was presented by jtoomin at HK last year which established segwit's 4MB as a safe upper limit. However any increase would be after segwit simply because it would be dangerous to have multiple things in flight at the same time.
But even so, political not technical compromise would mean that bitcoin as an apolitical currency would have failed, and the writing would be on the wall. We must as users and holders demand technical, not political compromise if bitcoin is to have any lasting value.

It doesn't matter who you are. If you are not making regular use of commit rights for review and merge (something Gavin _explicitly_ stepped down from doing when he changed jobs from maintainer to research scientist), then it is an ongoing risk to the entire ecosystem to have your commit rights maintained. What if Gavin's computer was hacked and his SSH keys copied?
As I said, there were several others who had commit access and had it revoked due to inactivity. This is necessary operational security for a project like bitcoin.

"Flexible Transactions" is vastly different from segwit -- different solutions to different problems.

My criticism is that while it is OK for there to exist A bitcoin foundation, it it not acceptable to have THE bitcoin foundation. It is a criticism of attitude which the name is only a symbol. I hope you understand this point.
Your organization definitely has in the past misrepresented itself as the central organizing body behind Bitcoin. And regardless of the truth of that, it has been a persistent uncorrected mistake made by just about every journalist in the space when referring to the organization or the people who work for it with grand titles.
I recognize that most of these mistakes predate you. But it is a problem that you have inherited and have to deal with.


The last few months? Let's see:
I wrote BIP 68, and implementations for BIPs 68, 112, and 113. Together with Peter Todd's BIP 65 these provide the first leg of protocol changes needed for lightning network. It would have been deployed already if your chief scientist hadn't thrown a wrench into the soft fork roll out process. I'm helping work on an alternative right now.
I was instrumental alongside a few others behind the scenes in making the scalingbitcoin.org workshops happen, up until the point they were announced and the committee took over. I have a talk accepted for the first workshop in Montreal that will cover proposed measurements of resource utilization as an alternative to the block size limit.
Then of course there was elements alpha which I played a project management role in addition to implementing the relative lock time feature that would later be returned to bitcoin as BIPs 68, 112 and 113.
I articulated and defended the flexcap proposal, which remains the only proposal for block size expansion that ties increasing limits to a developing fee market in a non-gameable way.
I am also working on some cool smart contracting extensions, but those aren't quite ready for public purview :)


Well that was one of the main reasons we decided to create Blockstream: to create an alternative model for funding core development.

Blockstream. It's a variation of "trust, but verify" which is an old cryptography saying (and a Russian proverb before that). It was suggested by Johnny Dilley to be the unofficial motto for the first Scaling Bitcoin workshop, for which Blockstream provided printed T-shirts. However the phrasing isn't quite right for bitcoin--we verify so that we shouldn't have to trust at all. Some iteration among the engineers (I remember Pieter Wuille and Warren Togami having comments, probably others too), and we came up with "Don't trust. Verify."

As I mentioned in a cousin comment, if you mark a specific output as replaceable then you've told the world (and all block chain analytic tools) what output is yours and what output was the payment. That is privacy destructive for you and everyone downstream of you, and something we would like to avoid doing, especially as a general practice.
Opt-in RBF also reveals this information when you compare the alternative transactions, but at least this info is only available to some peers at the moment the payment is being processed, and isn't baked into the block chain for all historical analysis.
The patch was not rushed through. It was discussed for months, just not on Reddit.

I would ask r/personalfinance about general concerns for cashing out a pension, irregardless of your intention to invest in Bitcoin (probably best not to mention that).
Depending on where you are, the type of the pension plan, etc. it may be the case that the pension funds are pre-tax, and would be subject to both tax withholdings and early-withdraw penalties if you cashout now. It is often possible to roll these pensions into an IRA account without it being a taxable event, if you do the paperwork correctly (I am not a tax attorney, this is not tax advice, etc.).
If you really wanted to put it in bitcoin, the best mechanism for doing so might be either a self-directed IRA (costly to setup, but probably less than early withdraw penalty), or one of the custodial bitcoin IRA options (which I am hesitant to recommend).

If there are sufficient transactions paying fees and blocks are full, the miner can choose to temporarily up their allowed block size at the cost of higher difficulty (less expected subsidy). A rational miner would choose to do so only when the gained fees are greater than expected loss of subsidy.
This is the basis of the flexcap proposal where the miner trades subsidy for block space, which is presumably filled with paying transactions.

BTW one thing missing in all this debate that you might find interesting is that sidechains, which only require a soft-fork to support the return peg, are essentially a soft-fork compatible and safe (well, safer) version of the Bitcoin Unlimited solution -- miners decide the block size by deciding how many and which of the merged mined sidechains of various sizes they choose to validate.
I and others find this idea potentially quite frightening, because we are concerned about the mis-aligned incentives that would result in miners happily trading centralization risk for the fees of larger blocks. But unfortunately there's just too much rebellion-vs-evil-empire thinking going on to realize that there is a desirable technology that serves both camps...

More worrisome is the possibility that someone is running a scam where they buy Ledgers from Amazon, fill out the seed, return it for refund, and wait for a n00b to get the used/refurbished/'like-new' product and use the seed.

"Hard fork" and "soft fork" are words with well established technical meaning. Something that "leads to a chain split" is a fork, unqualified. A soft fork is one that strictly adds or strengthens rules, whereas a hard fork removes or relaxes at least one existing rule. The lowering of the maximum block size is the addition/strengthinging of a rule, so it is the former (soft-fork) not the latter.
@_date: 2015-11-28 22:46:37
It is already easy to double spend. Connect yourself to the main miners and relay network directly (they have known, public IP addresses), and then also connect to as many other nodes (thousands) as possible. Send one transaction to the miners, while _simultaneously_ sending the double spend to as many other nodes as possible. Your counterparty will hear about the version you broadcasted widely, while the miners will actually accept the other. This is possible to do in a repeatable way with a success rate approaching 100%.
What replace by fee does is remove any naïve assumptions that zero-conf trust of transactions you did not sign is in any way safe. It is not.

I assumed we were talking about lightning, not sidechains. Sidechains are not a scaling solution (although they can be used to test scaling solutions, e.g. lightning works on elements alpha today).


Where is that number coming from? The current consensus rules are able to handle about 600k transactions per day. For a high-end estimate where everyone is using lightning and creating, closing out, or modifying a couple of channels each once a year or so, that allows a userbase of 100M or thereabouts (600k * 365 / 2) .
Okay, pedantically 100 million &lt; 7 billion. That's why no non-zealot who has looked at the issue is not in favor of maintaining a 1MB block size forever. But that's *a lot* of room for growth within current limits. It is orders of magnitude more than the current estimated number of bitcoin owners, which itself is orders of magnitude more than the number of people who actually use bitcoin day to day. We're not going to reach that level of usage this year, or next year, or maybe even by next decade. It puts a lie to the claim that block size increases are needed now, NOW, **NOW**, or else everything will fail.
We have time to build consensus around a solution that has been properly reviewed and which everyone can accept. There's no need to rush a poorly thought out proposal, or to scale bitcoin blocks to beyond what is necessary to preserve decentralization.

First of all no one is suggesting CT for Bitcoin. As far as I'm aware no one is made a proposal regarding this. Not yet anyway.
Second, it would be an opt-in feature, and only those who choose to use it would pay the higher fee. The free market would operate exactly as it does now and fee per kB would remain the same. You would not pay higher fees at all unless you chose to use the larger CT transactions.
Fewer CT transactions could fit in the block, if it was only full of CT transactions, but the reality is that you would have some people opting to pay for the privacy and others choosing not to.
Still this is all hypothetical as there has been no proposal as yet to add CT to Bitcoin.

Decentralization is not about the number of full nodes. There could be millions of full nodes running all over the world with a fully centralized bitcoin.
Decentralization in bitcoin is about _censorship resistance_, meaning a lack of control over transaction selection policy. Miners choose these policies, with their choices weighted by hashpower.
A larger block size leads to centralization in mining due to the costs involved in validating blocks and the well-studied effect of _selfish mining_. The larger the block size, the more advantage an already large miner has over his competition, leading to consolidation in the mining industry. When mining is reduced to a few large entities controlling a majority of hashpower (as is presently the case!), bitcoin is no longer decentralized and a failed experiment.

(1) doesn't involve users being coercively prevented from transacting on chain according to the rules in place when they started. That's a line I don't think we have any right to cross.
EDIT: To clarify, I'm not blind to the UX improvement of the second example. It is just a bit paternalistic in its coerciveness. That same line of thinking for example could be used to justify revocable payments -- so that in the event of a fork the new network can undo selective replay from the old network, etc. Or so that something like the DAO could be forceably wound-down when it is obvious it is no longer acting in its owner's interests. The bitcoin _I_ bought into treats people like adults and respects rights and freedoms to the exclusion of all else -- even if that means you might get burned if not paying attention.

Segwit certainly does increase the block size, to a maximum limit of just under 4MB. Witnesses *are* part of the block, just as they are today. It's just that there's a compatibility shim that lets old clients think blocks are smaller than they actually are.
Regarding effective sizes, Schnorr aggregation is not required for 2.1MB. That number is what the typical block would be if all spends were segwit using the currently observed mix of multi-signature vs regular outputs. Schnorr signatures with aggregation would be an additional gain that would take us up to 2.4MB or so (again, if everyone used it).

When founding the company we wanted to pay out incentive bonuses in fixed amounts of bitcoin that had monthly time-locks. So the company buys bitcoin equal to portion of your agreed upon compensation package up-front, and then these bitcoins are dolled out over a 5-year period in fixed amounts. So maybe when you started the price of bitcoin was $400, and now you're effectively getting 4x the "extra" compensation per month. It keeps people's incentives lined up with bitcoin.
The naive way of doing this is pretty bad in terms of privacy, but that could be fixed with some clever engineering. However as usual the man makes it difficult to do things that ought to be simple and cool. Our tax-lawyer advice was that the company needs (for US employees at least) to calculate witholding using the valuation at the time of transfer of ownership, then keep and pay that income tax withholding to the IRS. So alas rather than giving out time-locked transactions, there's someone somewhere in our HR that takes coins out of cold storage each month and calculates withholdings, sells the appropriate amount for covering tax liability, and forwards the rest on individually. No cool smart contracts involved :(
But it's certainly cool to have a portion of our compensation paid in bitcoin, and it has become even cooler in the past couple of months ;) There is downside risk though -- my start price was around $380, but there was a good year or so after that where the price was $200 or below. It didn't feel so good then to have my salary shrink in buying power :P That's part of why our "bitcoin incentive program" only starts out as a modest portion of the entire compensation package, so a temporary drop in price won't cause life problems like making it impossible to pay rent. People who came on immediately after me, in the depths of that bear market certainly did well though.

There was never a negotiation between a closed group of developers and a closed group of miners. That is not and never should be how bitcoin is governed.

"Bitcoin is illegal" implies more than what actually happened.
The chief financial regulator in Taiwan, while being grilled by a political committee about a recent high-profile kidnapping and ransom (paid in bitcoin), shifted blame from police ineptitude to techno-babble about the currency involved.
You know how dollar bills have little fine print saying "This note is legal tender for payment of all debts, public or private", or something to that effect? Basically he said Bitcoin doesn't have this protection. You can't pay your taxes in Taiwan with bitcoin. And yeah, that's the exact same situation as in every other country in the world.
Now police are going to issue a press release reminding the public that bitcoin is not legal tender in Taiwan. So criminals, when you kidnap high-profile billionaires and demand ransom in bitcoin, you are _technically_ breaking the law.
That said, the situation could be better regarding bitcoin in Taiwan. The same regulatory agency has not approved any bitcoin ATM in the country, and regularly warns the public against its use :\

Your edit it right. But also, we have a proof that a _third party_ can't malleable a Schnorr signature without knowledge of the private key.

Without the proof we don't know for certain if it is possible to malleate an ECDSA signature (change the nonce) without knowledge of the private key.

Conversely, this did NOT work for me in 2013-2014.

Instead I sold enough to make minimum payments and the cost of living... and ended up with a bunch of debt at the end of it.
Just sayin'. The market can, and will, stay irrational -- from your point of view -- longer than you can stay solvent.

No one is turning miners on or off. Rather the reported network hash rate is an ESTIMATE based on the average time between blocks, which itself is a RANDOM value drawn from a Poisson distribution with an expectation time proportional to the difficulty divided by the actual hash rate. But it's still random. The fact that at one time the "network hash rate" shown on the graph goes down could be because someone somewhere is switching off miners, OR it could be because that block or group of blocks just randomly happened to take a little longer to find while other blocks randomly took less. The latter, much more likely explanation is called 'variance.'
Look at the differently smoothed estimations in this graph, for example:

This is a common technique when multiple contractors need access to a site, but the site owner wants easier key management (you can revoke one's access rights without involving the others) and accountability.
Imagine a rancher that has an oil rig on his land. If some doofus coming in to maintain the thing forgets to lock the gate and the cattle escape, the rancher knows which company to hold liable and apply fines. And when he cancels his contract with them because they obviously can't be trusted, he can revoke their access and give the new contractor a new set of keys for a new lock without having to coordinate with the other 5 contractors that work on the site.

Not necessarily. The problem was probabilistic and typically only encountered during a reorg, which you wouldn't see during initial block download. If you put an early bitcoind into a watchman script that checked for stalled behavior &amp; killed and reindexed if that happened, you should be able to fully sync the chain. Indeed there are people who have been doing this.

Bitcoin demonstrates a third path -- it is absolitely NOT a democracy, but rather a tyrany of the consensus rules (code is law and all that). The authority of the block chain does not derive from having the "biggest number of guns" or the most votes either.

No, a mining node has max about 10 seconds or so to download and verify a block, or else centralization pressures become enormous due to selfish mining concerns.
The scalability of bitcoin's security assumptions depends on mining nodes, not your average full node just listening to the network.

That is hardly the only, or even driving reason. The concern over block size generally has to do with maintaining a decentralized, censorship-resistant network as larger blocks increase centralization pressures for a variety of reasons.
Making sure Bitcoin is usable over Tor helps prevent some forms of censorship and is certainly a healthy thing for Bitcoin. But it's not the only story here.

Because it tightens consensus rules. A hard fork lifts restrictions instead. These are technical terms with strictly defined meaning. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 02:44:26
This is nonsense. I don't know anyone who is actually working on a hard fork right now (although I'm sure someone is). Keep in mind very few core developers were at the HK meeting and that 'agreement' is mostly not acceptable to those who were not there.
If you read the meeting minutes you'll see lots of segwit review and zero talk of hard forks. There's a face to face meeting about to start in Zürich in a few hours. I expect much of the time will be spent on segwit review and release coordination. If it is spent instead on hard forking, I can at least say I'll be walking out.

Note that I edited the GP comment. You might want to look at that.
Extension blocks IMHO should generally be held to the same standards as soft-forks and are not intrinsically bad -- assuming you are not talking about a _forced extension block_ which has empty wrapper blocks.
I'm taking "extension blocks," unqualified, to mean a two-way pegged sidechain whose full consensus rules are enforced by upgrades nodes of the parent chain and therefore need to be relayed as well to other upgraded nodes. I'm obviously in favor of sidechains and an extension block is probably the least impactful way to execute a hard-fork change.
So basically extension blocks have the same moral dimensions as soft-forks, all things being equal. For example, if we had an extension block that supported CT/mimblewimble, and capped the total aggregate block weight to be the same (1MB for old block + extension block combined), then this is a proposal really no different than segregated witness or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY in its implications.
Of course the subtext of your question I assume is extension blocks as a soft-fork means of growing (extending) the block size. This _would_ be a change to the security model of non-upgraded nodes, because of the centralizing effect of larger blocks. It would only be justifiable to pull off if there was absolute unanimity in support.
@_date: 2015-11-29 00:40:39
It does not matter whether nodes relay double-spends or not. Someone actually attempting to pull off a double-spend would broadcast simultaneously to partitioned sets of nodes. They would not rely on relay to get the double-spend to miners; they would deliver it themselves With present behavior this does NOT inform the user that a double spend is being attempted. RBF would at least cause a transaction with a higher fee to be relayed such that the counterparty might find out about it from other nodes.
Also, Gavin hasn't been involved in Bitcoin Core development for more than a year. I have no idea what his opinion of RBF is (in any form).

Is Blockstream a major player? Yes. So is MIT who pays for more core dev than Blockstream by the way. But both of them combined only amount for about about half of the bitcoin commits. This power law distribution is very normal for this sort of collaborative project.
Besides to conflate the two is extremely insulting to the developers who do not work for Blockstream, who make up a clear supermajority.

I don't think it is useful to call May 2013 a hard-fork. In March 2013 there was a complicated consensus failure that is difficulty to classify. It was resolved by adding a consensus rule by the miners that kept everyone on the same page, and then removing this consensus rule two months later. Ok, technically that was a hard-fork for those miners. But for everyone else who was running older clients nothing changed...

This explanation does not make sense to me. A max legacy block size increase does not require SPV nodes to upgrade because it is transparent to them. They cannot even see that a block is larger of they just see individual transactions and their Merkle proofs. However it is presently a rule that a transaction cannot be &gt;1MB, because a block cannot be, so an SPV node that receives proof of a larger tx might choose to reject it.

Mark from Blockstream here. That's pretty much what the DPL is (hence the similar name). Patent law and copyright law are different, and "put patents under the GPL" doesn't make legal sense. You need to craft a copyleft legal agreement that is respectful of the differences between what patents and copyrights are, what can be accomplished with either, and the differing threat models. A copyright license and a patent license are different things, and a copyright infraction and a patent infraction are handled differently by our system of law. Any approach taken to freeing patents in the copyleft sense must be respectful of those differences in order to have a maximally beneficial outcome.
Note that Kat Walsh, our lawyer handling IP issues, is [on the board of directors of the FSF]( We're getting pretty much the best FOSS-oriented legal advice we can here, and the DPL + IPA + legally binding pledge structure that she and external counsel come up with is basically the answer to the question of what a "AGPL for patents" would look like, given the different properties of patents vs copyrights.

People keep asking this, and I kept ignoring it because I thought it was missing the point and somewhat trollish: "how do you measure X except by hashrate; read the whitepaper!" is the universal justification for those that support ceding all control over everything to the miners, or are shilling for that position. However enough people have asked this question that I think it deserves an answer, and you do seem to be asking genuinely.
First and foremost, it is hard to gauge adoption and support for a grassroots protocol change. **That is entirely the point**. I cannot stress this enough. Changing bitcoin protocol is supposed to be hard. That's exactly what keeps miners and industry cabals in check most of the time. Firing a nuclear missile is supposed to be difficult, not something that could literally be done at the push of a button. That is by design.
That said, I would like for an exchange to offer trading on a split currency prior to activation, much like Bitfinex did with BU for example. That would essentially be a prediction market operated by the exchange, and prediction markets have proven useful in measuring likelihood of outcomes where data is distributed and direct measurement fails. The approach has some flaws, namely that whales could temporarily move the activation estimate in an attempt to gain momentum behind either outcome. But it's still better than any other proposal I've heard.
Of course at the end of the day there isn't some person who decides for everybody. Every user has to look a the data available to them and decide what to do. That personal responsibility is the nature of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-29 19:48:20
The concept of "normal bitcoin account" doesn't make sense. I suspect there is a misunderstanding about how bitcoin works that is clouding your perception of Lightning, but it is hard to diagnose what exactly that is.
Lightning is just bitcoin transactions constructed in a very particular way, a way which happens to allow delayed broadcast without double spend risk. Lightning is bitcoin.

"Six confirms is safe" is based on the assumption that miners are validating the blocks they build on. As we saw with BIP66, if &gt;50% of the miners are not validating then you can have *any* length invalid chain, or at least as long as it takes for the miners to notice and take corrective action. In practice we've observed this to be dozens of blocks, opening up the opportunity for double-spends.

Why seek to satisfy the NY agreement? Why should we care in the slightest what an elitist, invite-only group decides what the rules of bitcoin should be? Is that what bitcoin is about? Appeasement doesn't work. It only sets you up for future troubles.
The community wants segwit. Businesses are ready for segwit. The code has been done for some time now. If anyone (a mining cabal, an industry group, whatever). Wants to hold the bitcoin network hostage, you do not respond with negotiations -- that would only confirm that hostage-taking pays off. You respond by exercising the one power users have as fully validating nodes: UASF.
I hope that a majority of mining hashpower will come around to activate segwit or run BIP148 by Aug 1st. They can even do all the PR they want to make it seem like it was their idea, and they're being gracious in adopting segwit or whatever nonsense. One way or another BIP148 will have forced segwit adoption, and bitcoin will be truly stronger for it because the decentralized check on mining and industry power would will have gone from theory to practice.

Any bitcoin acquired through mining has a cost basis of the cost of mining those coins (that's where the phrase cost basis comes from). If you spent $500 on mining hardware and $250 on electricity and $50 on an internet connection to mine 1 BTC, that 1BTC has a cost basis of $800.

EDIT: I have been told by Rusty that Blockstream does in fact have a single provisional patent on shachain, which is an efficient mechanism for hash time-lock contracts. I was not aware of this when I commented previously. Shachain is not used in the original Lightning paper (or else that would be prior art), but it is used in our implementation of lightning-like payment channels, and perhaps others too. Like all our software patents it is made perpetually available under the terms of the DPL, and if that's not enough you can convince Rusty to give you a license personally under the terms of the IPA.

Sometimes a point needs to be said bluntly to call attention to differences that might otherwise seem subtle or inconsequential. The point of contention here is not over the specific proposals per se, but rather how we as a community of bitcoin users allow changes to be made to the protocol. The sort of scenarios where the dream of bitcoin dies trace their origin back to agreements of this form.
Our defence of the bitcoin protocol, as users of that same protocol is entirely based on the difficulty of changing the consensus rules without absolute agreement -- not a majority, nor a super-majority, but rather near-unanimous support. The first step towards changing that requirement is to move towards a system of decision by proxy. That is the very structure of this 'agreement': the undersigned captains of industry have agreed on what rules YOU should validate on YOUR node.
That is not how we make changes to bitcoin. I am pro-UASF for the sole reason that such grassroots efforts are the only legitimate way to force protocol rule changes. I have not loudly professed that view only because I have become associated with bitcoin development, and developers cannot choose the rules of bitcoin. Nor can miners. Nor should we allow an industry cabal this power either. USERS control bitcoin, but they must take proactive steps to assert and retain this control lest they see it taken away from them.
As a _user_ of bitcoin, I refuse to abide by this agreement. I run BIP148 for all my nodes and will see segwit activated with no strings attached. Should that effort have broad-based support but still fail, a PoW change would be the likely next step.
If you are concerned about the price, then please sell your holdings and invest in something more suited to your views. We are talking about the future of disintermediated commerce, sound money, and direct p2p private law. I will not compromise something as socially transformative as bitcoin over misplaced greed.

Slight correction/elaboration: an inflation-adjusted 6% is actually reasonable for broad-market index funds since WW2. It's even slightly conservative if you're talking about recent (post 70's oil crisis) history. But whether you think this past performance is predictive of the future is another matter..
The real problem is variance. In retirement you have relatively fixed costs, but investment returns are variable from year to year. If you start off on a good or even average year, you get more capital gains than you spend. But on a bad year you spend more than you gain, which has the double-whammy of decreasing your investment principal. Now even if the next year is good, your returns will have been reduced as you are making up lost ground. Suffer a couple of bad years in a row and you can no longer expect to live off capital gains alone.
The 4% assumption comes from the Trinity Study which showed (via simulation and historical analysis) that if you only spend per year 4% of your nest egg at the time you retired, adjusted for inflation since then, then you are unlikely to have "portfolio failure" (aka going bankrupt) in the next 30 years.

I don't know; I can only truthfully answer with my own preferences and hopes. I prefer soft forks to hard forks, but if a hard fork is necessary I'd rather do one and only one -- so multiple changes would need to be batched together rather than staged to get my support. However it is not clear to me if there will ever be a hard fork because there is still ample room for soft fork feature extension and unrealized performance gains to be had, as well has hard scaling limits that have yet to be circumvented.

No other changes beyond segwit are necessary, strictly speaking, for limitless capacity increases. Segwit's malleability fixes allow for practical, deployable multi-contingency smart contracts, of which lightning is just one example. These allow for limitless capacity because such contracts can be carried out trustlessly off chain using the limited capacity on chain only for dispute resolution and collateral reallocation.

To elaborate, FSS-RBF (1) results in larger transactions because you must add a new input rather than just adjust your change output, and (2) is a wallet implementor's nightmare to get right because it involves merging coins to update a fee. If you care about privacy and/or keeping sources of coins separate to defeat block chain analysis, FSS-RBF requires keeping pools of UTXOs available to update fees.

I'm not putting my faith in what most users want. I'm sure most users were told that bitcoin is instant, near-free p2p payments. That used to be what the semi-official bitcoin.org website said, sadly :(
Regardless of what people _feel_ about bitcoin, it objectively has very special properties that make it unique in its ability to disintermediate the banking system and give users direct control over a sound money with deterministic private contract law. Such a thing is precious. It has never existed in the history of humanity, and deserves to be protected, even from those who would desire to subvert it in good faith for their own less interesting needs.

I am against it, although I've been mostly silent so far because I don't want that being interpreted as pro-AsicBoost (which I am not!).
The sort of hard-fork that has been proposed is fixing the symptom, not the problem. If we're going to hard fork the proof of work then we might as well do something more substantial to fix decentralized mining. Doing a simple targeted fix to prevent AsicBoost essentially endorses the status-quo, which itself is driving us towards more and more centralized mining, destroying bitcoin.
Beyond that it's also not clear what the repercussions would be. AsicBoost was independently discovered by Spondoolies and BitMain, and has already been deployed in an large but unknown percentage of the hash rate. So there's a simple pragmatic concern that it would never be deployed because miners aren't going to invalidate their own (patent infringing) hardware.

The only relevant time is how long it takes for miners, weighted by hashpower, to hear about the block. It really doesn't matter how long it takes other nodes... the worry over latency is the centralization pressure that it causes due to delaying block relay for miners, giving those with more hashpower a greater advantage. Even if it took an extra minute or two (unrealistically excessive) for the blocks to make it to non-mining full nodes, that wouldn't really be a problem.

I prefer the terminology of "nodes" not "hubs." A hub implies a form of centralization which is not baked into the lightning protocol. Although it is unfortunately the case that there are centralizing pressures to create hubs in order to minimize payment hops and therefore fees, this is not mandated by the protocol and in fact the protocol is explicitly designed for ad-hoc, decentralized payment networks.
I mention this only because confusion over nodes vs. hubs seems to be a common and persistent mistake that gets in the way of understanding how lightning works. Getting back to your question:
Lightning nodes are not custodians. When you build a payment channel you and the counterparty put coins into a 2-of-2 multisig contract. Spends require both of your signatures, so it is absolutely impossible for the other party to take your funds without your permission.
Lightning payments involve constructing spend transactions which settle the net balance for the channel, and then replacing these transactions for each payment. Each replacement must be signed by both parties before it can be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.
So there aren't any IOUs involved, and your signature is required to spend your coins. Make sense?

Since you seem to be actually willing to engage, let me offer you an answer to your original question:
Blockstream does not hold its assets in bitcoin because (1) volatility risk would compromise our ability to execute, and (2) it would probably be illegal (but IANAL).
It is actually unclear whether we'd be better off today if we had kept it in bitcoin from the day we first received our investment. Bitcoin was ~$500 when we got our first investment, and then spent a long time in the $200 - $300 range. Expenses during that time would have really cut into our runway. Would we have been able to focus on tech development (Confidential Transactions, Sidechains, etc.) with a runway that is rapidly shrinking? Unclear. Would we have been able to raise the Series A round with that in mind? Also unclear. There are prior examples of companies doing exactly this in earlier cycles and being destroyed by an extended bear market.
And if the price went up? Also bad. We received investment dollars for a business plan that involved specific technology and product developments. Having a lot of money in a warchest is nice, but it changes priorities. We would have executed quite differently if a few tens of millions in the bank suddenly turned into billions. Would investors be happy to own a share of that? Yes, but if that's what they wanted they could have just bought bitcoin and had fewer expenses. They invested in us because for various reasons particular to each investor they wanted to see us execute on the plan we presented. Volatility, up or down, risks the viability of that plan.
Finally, to the second point, the exact same argument could be made to Apple or other companies with massive cash warchests. Why don't they stick that money in index funds? In some cases they don't even put it in T-bonds, just cash in the bank. The reason is that if they did, they would effectively be running an unlicensed mutual fund in violation of many securities regulations. There are laws and regulation on the books that determine what a business can do with its funds, and as a legal entity we have to respect that.

Correction to u/AaronVanWirdum: pedantically, BIP 62 is not required for lightning, although it is required in order to have a quality user experience. Also, "Lightning" usually refers to schemes involving relative time-lock, e.g. BIPs 68 &amp; 112, not absolute time-lock (BIP 65).
BIP 65: enables traditional payment channels with trustless setup. This is sufficient for pseudo-Lightning with baked-in channel expiration and locked funds, which would be a suboptimal user experience as the counterparty to a channel could hold funds hostage, even if for a limited period of time, and fee would need to be paid to renew a channel at periodic intervals.
BIP 68 + BIP 112: full-on Lightning is possible, using hash-locked contracts instead of malleability fixes. This approach does not suffer from the tradeoff between availability of funds and channel duration. Channels can be kept open indefinitely, yet close quickly even if the counter-party is unresponsive. The downside is it requires having your node online 24/7, or at least checking in more frequently the duration of the close-out, and being able to respond quickly. This service cannot be outsourced without giving up full control of your funds. It's an annoying, although perhaps not unsolvable limitation.
BIPs 68, 112, plus one of BIP 62, segregated witness, or other such malleability fix: removes the requirement that the user be online 24/7. The malleability fix ensures that you can instead pre-sign dependent transactions and then outsource the responsibility of broadcasting them to one or more third parties, for a fee. Should the counterparty try to cheat while you are offline, the untrusted third party will intervene on your behalf without taking any more than the fee allocated to them for doing so.

Since there are people and businesses who trust the git repository -- even though they shouldn't -- those who manage the write access permissions (which does not include me) should be super careful about who it is given out to.

In principle, yes, and it would be an improvement. Indeed one could argue that segregated witness is how bitcoin should have been constructed from the get-go. It is qualitatively better in every way without any downsides. BTW there are other changes that slipped from alpha and which will hopefully be in the next release that provide other benefits that are better in every way over the status quo, so this isn't unique to segregated witness.
However Satoshi did not have the foresight to build bitcoin in these ways :( It is the simple truth that any change made to bitcoin must come with transition support. And unfortunately not only are these changes hard forks, but as hard forks go they are very hard. Any code that computes or verifies transaction IDs -- which is just about all code out there -- would need to be upgraded. This is in contrast to say a block size increase that would be wholely invisible to SPV nodes.
Sorry to bring that topic in, but now that it has been broached.. one of the reasons that I am personally advocating for a measured, carefully thought out approach to the block size increase is that if we do our job right we can get a number of these uncontroversial, everyone benefits hard forks in too. We might not get another chance at making such changes. But that said, it think it would be unlikely that segregated witness would be among these changes as its infrastructure impact does make it controversial :(
Edit: to elaborate, the issue is that the Merkle tree proofs used by SPV wallets to prove inclusion of a transaction in a block would no longer validate when segregated witness was turned on, because the hash of the transaction would be different.

It's a semi-moot point anyway. Turns out segregated witness can be done as a soft fork without changing how txids are calculated. Do a P2SH-like construction committing to the hash of the redeem script: unlike P2SH, it becomes a consensus rule that the spending txin's scriptSig is empty. The _actual_ scriptSig (with the redeem script) is committed to somewhere else in the block and transmitted alongside the transaction and the block which includes. The scriptSig isn't contained within the transaction anymore, so it isn't part of the data that is hashed to get the txid. This is an equivalently powerful form of segregated witness as the hard-fork variant in Sidechain Elements, but easier to deploy to Bitcoin Core and the new transaction semantics can be safely ignored (with SPV security) by older clients.

We have different definitions of straight forward it seems. Redefining the transaction identifier is a simple change to the bitcoin code base. It is how we did it in Elements Alpha.

While it is true that it is a memorandum of understanding, not a contract, the point is it was signed by a small group of developers and the miners. It is not binding on anyone, but especially not those who were not there and did not sign it. And the vast majority of developers did NOT sign it.

Yeah it is a fucked up situation. Basically anyone who bought a home decades ago in any of the townships between outer San Francisco and San Jose is sitting on a winning lottery ticket. In each case local incentives have caused political pressure to keep supply low because everyone knows demand will go up regardless. You can see this recently play out in Google's bid to develop virgin land on the bayside of 101 in mountain view. The local government is fighting it tooth and nail for very thinly masked property value reasons.
The moral I guess is that incentives matter... The logical outcome doesn't always come to pass.

Well, on the API side I think it should probably be handled like this:
    [nLockTime 0 NOP2] = CHECK_LOCK_TIME_VERIFY(nLockTime)
    [nDepth 1 NOP2] = CHECK_MATURITY_VERIFY(nDepth)
    [x n&gt;1 NOP2] = NOP
I thought about hiding a flag indicating absolute (CLTV) vs relative (CMV) in the low order bit of the lock time, but adding another parameter leads to smaller patches and allows future use of NOP2 for soft-fork features. It might even be the start of a pattern where NOPn is used for opcodes that take (n-1) parameters plus a secondary opcode, as in this case.
The technical implementation is actually straight-forward. You extend the signature checker to take the UTXO data and current block height as input as well, then add a CheckMaturity() virtual method. It's just that the absolute best way IMHO depends on another change that I think we should have -- splitting the CCoins structure which represents all the unspent outputs of a transaction to many CCoin structures are the individual unspent outputs, and that being the data that is passed into the signature checker. This has the added benefit of making Merkle commitments of the UTXO set cleaner.
By the way, I have an updated branch of your checklocktimeverify (rebased against bitcoin/master of a few days ago) here:

As far as the bitcoin network is concerned, the "inbetween" transactions are indeed taking 0 bytes as Bitcoin nodes never see them. They don't download them, they don't validate them, so they don't factor into global scaling issues at all.
As for how much traffic it is expected a lightning node could handle, that's totally an internet engineering question. How much bandwidth is available for you to buy, and how many computers to servers to process that traffic? The answer as far as bitcoin block size scaling is concerned is that it doesn't matter because those transactions never hit the chain.

This is a meeting of CEOs and strategists who feel they are not given the respect their position in this industry deserves. Such an agreement would be contrary to the basic value proposition of bitcoin. Bitcoin protocol rules are wholly owned by its users, and changes can only be made by overwhelming user mandate. Not because it is good for business. Not because the developers want X, Y, or Z. And certainly not to stroke the egos of captains of industry who feel they aren't being listened to. Well, grow up. The purpose of bitcoin is to disintermediate people like you. Don't force us to remind you of that fact. You do not change the protocol rules of bitcoin with agreements made in closed-door, invite-only meetings. Bitcoin does not, and will not respect such agreements.
If you truly want a solution to this impasse, I cannot think of a worse thing to do than this. Barry, you are setting the stage for your own undoing as this agreement fails to have its intended effect as the rest of us struggle towards resolution in spite of the "agreement." Probably the only good that will come of it is UASF activation of segwit with no strings attached as a demonstration that the users, not the members of this cabal, run bitcoin.
Jihan, if you want to save face then start signaling support for segwit. We'll let you feel like it was your idea all along, if that makes you feel better.

@_date: 2017-07-23 11:48:51
What bits are set is currently a configurable option for most mining pool software. Meaning, there is absolutely no guaranteed correlation between what it is set and what software is running. Indeed multiple pools said when they started signaling it 4 that they were NOT running segwit2x, but would later switch. Did they? We don't have anything other than their word.
In the past it has happened that we've had features activated which the mining pool software does not support, and short lived forks have resulted. Now however the situation has flipped meaning that in a failure mode a long lived fork would probably be the result.

The reason this is not an issue for lighting is that in lightning a transaction is signed by both parties. You can trust a 0-conf lightning payment because if there was a double-spend you would have had to sign it, and you don't remember doing that!
(This is a broad oversimplification of lightning, which is actually insanely complex in order to avoid various pathological cases. But it is accurate in the intuition in builds for _why_ lightning works.)

Nodes have a lot more than 8 connections. But that's not the point.
If less than 50% of the hash rate is actually enforcing BIP91, then a non-BIP141 block, once mined, will be built on by the majority of the hash power, resulting in a long-lasting and permanent chain split. MOST nodes are not BIP91 nodes. They are not at this time mandating that the segwit bit be set -- not even BIP148 nodes as that doesn't start until Aug 1st. So most nodes out there will happily follow the most-work chain, which includes a BIP91-invalid block (not signaling BIP-91).

I think it is way too early to make that kind of assessment. With technology we know how to build we can scale to 1,000x or 1,000,000x current levels of activity, without even counting activities that are impossible now (like sub-cent micro transactions). A few years ago it wasn't known that lightning like systems were possible. By the time we hit limits orders of magnitude above where we are now, what technology will exist then?
Talking about future block size hardforks to support more lightning settlement is like making arrangements for 1 billion people living in Mars. Even Elon Musk is concerning himself with nearer term issues than that.

No, we are not. Not without assumptions of miner behavior. They can pull out as long as more than 50% of the hash rate follows, or they could be at least half false flag signaling (not actually running BIP91) in which case the first non-BIP141 block will cause a persistent chain split. We're not out of the woods yet. HODL and run UASF BIP148 to keep them honest.

This is sadly not fully true :( The reason is that to be competitive a miner will have to collect fees from all actively used sidechains. That means that they will have to be running every single sidechain daemon. And due to the nature of merged-mined block-finding algorithms, when they find a block for bitcoin that block will also count for all the sidechains, meaning that block relay for all chains will be done at once. So the computational and bandwidth requirements placed on the miner are essentially the same as if it was one giant mainchain instead of a bunch of sidechains.
That said, there are some benefits. The sidechains are effectively sharded and can be validating in parallel on different servers or using bandwidth of different internet connections.
More importantly perhaps, sidechains give us a way of testing real scalability solutions before deploying them to bitcoin. CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, for example, has been deployed in Elements Alpha now for about six months, and is now being considered for inclusion in bitcoin core.

Part of ensuring a safe UASF activation is making sure that nodes which have not opted in are nevertheless not left exposed. Right now the best option for making this happen is BIP 148 -- for which the near-term time table of an Aug 1st UASF activation is *necessary* in order to drag along all the BIP 141 nodes. Most people have updated to a version of Bitcoin Core that supports BIP 141. If we activate UASF by setting the BIP 141 bit early enough to ensure activation by Nov 15th, then these full nodes will remain secured against later attempts to partition the network.
"Let's take our time and get it right" *sounds* good, but in fact we are left considerably safer by acting NOW, in this brief window of opportunity that is made available to us.

@_date: 2016-05-27 14:28:17
In general, yes. If you fork (hard or soft) to add rules which make some existing transactions invalid (e.g. transactions &gt;100kB), and one of those invalidated transactions is the timelocked spend transaction for which the original key no longer exists, then you have effectively destroyed those bitcoins. That why core is very careful to not adopt forks (soft or hard) which potentially invalidate existing unseen transactions. For example, the logic of BIP 68 only activates with tx.nVersion&gt;=2, since some colored coin protocols were using the nSequence field for other purposes. These other transactions remain valid under the new rules if they complied with best practices of not changing tx.nVersion==1, or if they did the maximum relative locktime of ~1yr means their coins aren't locked _forever_.
In this specific case, no. Our timelocked coins are not stored in such a way as to be at risk (at least any more than other multi-sig coins).
@_date: 2016-05-25 01:24:53
Maybe. If it is safe to do so. The data driven analysis from Scaling Bitcoin was that it is not safe to do so at this time. The roadmap enumerates some of the technologies that have potential to increase scalability. Work on some of these (e.g. compressed blocks) is ongoing. Once deployed and their effect measured, we can look again at a possible hard fork, as per the roadmap.

Theymos along with the other moderators have a philosophy that heavy moderation is required to maintain a civil discourse medium. They also took a rather patronizing attitude towards moderation of this subreddit a year ago when bitcoin was going through a governance crisis. Regardless of whether that was correct thing to do or not, it was not well received by many who interpreted it as taking sides in the debate.

Yes there are examples of explicit transaction prioritization, but that isn't a problem. Centralizing transaction selection to a 51% cabal means they ALSO have the capability, whether they are doing so now or not, of _censoring_ transactions. That's not an acceptable situation to be in.

You know that how?
It only takes one block to be mined. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 23:35:55
But it doesn't have all the benefits. Segregated witness, for example, allows the signatures to be dropped entirely from the initial block download, if they aren't going to be checked anyway (e.g. because they are before the most recent checkpoint). This is even more beneficial with technology like confidential transactions which stuffs a whole lot of other info into the signature script. Right now pruned nodes syncing the block chain download 10's of gigabytes of data that is hashed once and thrown away. Segregated witness gets rid of this waste (in addition to definitively solving third-party malleability); SIGHASH_NOINPUT does not.

Because it takes ~3 days minimum to move hardware from China to the pacific northwest, where power is actually cheaper, before even counting infrastructure setup and regulatory and tax differences.

The only difference between BIP141 signaling blocks and non-BIP141 is the status of a single bit in what header. It has no effect on block size.

As block size increases, miners with lower latency connections (e.g. centralized, co-located pools) have higher apparent hashrates due to their blocks having fewer orphans. In the limit this results in full centralization of the network.
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:57:32
UASF will take place. After around 23 July, assuming miners aren't false flag signaling, the majority of mining hashpower will begin ignoring non-segwit-signalling blocks. However this is nothing more than a pinky promise and they can revert at any moment they choose. Most infrastructure does not run BIP91 and would happily reorg onto a non-segwit-signalling chain if it was otherwise valid and it represented more work.
BIP148 / UASF nodes, on the other hand, will start ignoring non-segwit-signalling blocks no matter what starting 1 Aug. This prevents the miners from backing out of BIP91, as doing so would fork them off from BIP148 nodes.
People who want segwit to activate should continue running BIP148 nodes to prevent miners from reneging on BIP91.

Sorry, unable to cite; it was a conversation I had with him in person. But it comes down to things that were discussed on the cipherpunks mailing list and bitgold back in the day. At that time I talked to him, which was post-bitcoin, Szabo was still insistent that the cost of production gave intrinsic value to a currency. E.g. a coin that was mined with 2x difficulty was worth twice as much. Satoshi accomplished what he did by explicitly rejecting this mistaken belief (which wasn't just Szabo's, others like Adam Back had gone down this path).

Supply in this case means coins being sold on the market. The (mostly flawed) assumptions here are that miners are immediately dumping coins and that constitutes most of the daily volume.

I'm not sure you understand the proposal Taek42 is talking about. The proposal is that during periods of full blocks, the view of time the validator uses for nTimeLock and nSequence checks does not advance. So if a block is full, the clock does not move forward by 10 minutes. This is a soft-fork change in behavior.
So if you try to block a settlement by flooding the network with fee paying transactions, all that will do is burn fee -- the settlement period will automatically be extended by the network.
I think this is a dead on arrival proposal as stated for the simple reasons that we should expect that blocks will always be full. There might be some way you could combine this with flexcap, such that if the flexcap is engaged then the advancement of time is delayed.

By a process called _netting_. It takes one transaction to setup a payment channel with initial balances, and one transaction to tear it down with the final, aggregate balance. Inbetween a practically infinite number of transactions can occur which do not hit the block chain. As long as at least 2-3 transactions occurred off-chain, it's a net win in terms of block space.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:26:25
I updated my comment to be even simpler. Yes the new chain is an entirely different block chain. But the old chain is forced by miners to be empty, so people have no way of transacting on the old chain and must either do something to fork off the miners or submit to running the new code.
FWIW I think this is a terrible idea and would actively fight it.

The acquisition is unrelated. As explained in the blog post, we (Blockstream) wanted a wallet software stack to complement some of our enterprise products, e.g. a wallet for sidechains. We lacked the talent to do a good job of it internally, and we were very impressed with what Lawrence has built. So the solution was quite obvious from early on. It just took a lot of time with lawyers to get this far.
That said, of course as Lightning matures and is made available for production use I'm sure Lawrence's team will explore how best to integrate it into their product offerings. I say "their" because even though GreenAddress is part of Blockstream now, Lawrence remains head of the consumer-facing brand and is empowered to make decisions regarding the GreenAddress technical roadmap and development priorities. Nothing changes in that regard. So it remains his call and I don't want to speak for him :)

Well the best case scenario is that miners start signaling BIP-141 **NOW** so that segwit activates in July and the BIP-148 users revert their nodes.
BIP-148 will cause a chain split eventually under any circumstance where a majority of hash-rate is not BIP-148. Even if a super-majority of hash-rate is signaling for BIP-141, as soon as a non-signaling block is found those pro-BIP141, non-BIP148 nodes will build off that block and find their blocks orphaned by the BIP-148 nodes.
The only safe option to avoid a chain split here is to fully activate segwit before August 1st, thereby allowing the BIP-148 nodes to back down and deactivate their chain split logic. Which of course is the point of of the BIP-148 brinkmanship.

This is specific to current hardware wallet architectures, or other applications which require inclusion proofs of input data.

Avoiding a chain split requires more than a majority of miners mining bit1 blocks themselves. They must also explicitly orphan non-bit1 blocks to remain compatible with BIP-148.

I find it strange that you say the UASF movement is dead, or that the BIP-148 advocates are not getting exactly what they wanted. UASF is a game of chicken, and the NYA is the other side preparing to swerve.
Running into august without segwit lock-in and causing a BIP-148 chain split was never the desired outcome. It was the threat of total annihilation that would force capitulation because the alternative is too scary to even contemplate. And that is exactly what we are seeing with the NYA: capitulation.
Although so far they are failing to setup a timeline that would actually avoid an Aug 1st chain split.

BIP91 != NYA. James Hilliard was not involved with the NYA as far as I'm aware. BIP-91 is James' attempt to meet the letter of the agreement by his interpretation, in a way that is somewhat less insane than the actual intent. However it cannot be ignored that at the time of signing, BIP-91 was NOT being discussed or implemented by the NYA people. So are miners putting "NYA" in their coinbase indicating support for James Hilliard's thing, or the agreement they actually signed?
Hell if I know, honestly. It's a clusterfuck of mis-matched intent and implementation.

The two are not the same because what matters is the block transmission latency expressed as a fraction of the average interblock time. Because the latency has a large constant factor (due to speed of light and some fixed processing costs), half-sized blocks at half-sized intervals has a higher latency-per-period ratio, leading to greater centralization pressures.

The objections are real (I agree with many of them), but IMHO are either confined to the particular extension block proposal Poon et al made, or are fixable. I'm not sure how to evaluate the "more complicated" argument because hard forks are by their very nature *extremely* complicated to roll out, even if the consensus code changes are simple. Also some of the complication objections go away if the extension block supported a flexible cap, as then at least there will only ever be one extension block, not successively added extension blocks as the block-size limit is continuously raised.

The secp256k1 docs are actually pretty good:
The planned implementation will be Schnorr signatures using the secp256k1 curve (same as bitcoin currently uses). It's just a different scheme for computing and verifying signatures using the same curve. This actually is already done -- the Alpha chain of Sidechain Elements uses EC Schnorr over secp256k1 for its signatures, an implementation that has gotten significant review as a result. Key trees have also been implemented. What is not done is poly sigs and the infrastructure surrounding putting all this together with a wallet that supports such scripts.

(Since I was paged.) I've already said my piece regarding BIP-148 in Bitcoin Core on the relevant PR:
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:03:42
It's not enough for BIP-141 signaling to begin. In a period of BIP-141 signaling and even after activation it is allowed for a miner to create a non-signaling or non-segwit block. Even if a super majority of hash power starts setting bit1, the rules of BIP-141/BIP-9 allow for the small minority of blocks that *don't* set bit1. These blocks will be rejected by BIP-148 nodes.
Also, and somewhat pedantically, there is never a case in the BIP-141 logic where non-segwit blocks are rejected. The system was designed to be compatible with a minority of miners who don't upgrade, unlike BIP-148 which explicitly rejects non-signaling blocks.

It's a bit more complex than that. The NYA calls for a hard-fork, and if that hard-fork moves the segwit commitment out of the coinbase then it will re-enable covert asicboost. Also, you can still covert ASICBOOST a block that contains no segwit transactions.

What contract?

Which is far too late to prevent a Aug 1 chain split.

Segwit doesn't put its commitment in the coinbase string. It is in one of the outputs instead.
Putting the commitment in the block header or at the top of the Merkle path has the disadvantage of adding 32-bytes to every SPV proof for lite clients, when lite clients are precisely the most bandwidth constrained.

Then not use an extension block with flexcap so you never have to hard fork at all?

I can confirm. I went through a box of stuff from a recent move, and found one of these that was given out as schwag at the 2013 bitcoin conference. They were pre-loaded with 1 mBTC, which still isn't a lot of money. Still I figured why not? I'll sweep it. Clean up a UTXO if nothing else. But the funds were already moved:
EDIT: Initial load was in 2014? Maybe this was from the Amsterdam conference. Anyone remember when these were given out?

There's related work done in the past. Just need to make the scarf fool the currency detection logic too:

To be fair, the relationship isn't obvious from the URl. The Elements Project is an industry wide collaboration which Blockstream started and which has received nearly all of its IP so far from Blockstream. This patent pledge, DPL, and MIPA apply to patents Blockstream might take out on technology like that which it has already made public via the Elements Project.

How do you classify a forced transition to a new block chain? It's neither a hard fork nor a soft fork. My point was more that "can't be done with a soft-fork" and "requires a hard-fork" are _not_ the same thing.
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:16:35
That is in reference to the first bullet point of the agreement. The first bullet point says "proceed towards release" which I take to mean "pull request made." The 2nd bullet point says "after the release of SegWit" which I would take to mean "an official Bitcoin Core release with SegWit activation logic."
Truth be told I'm interpreting this much the same as you -- I wasn't there and I don't know exactly what either side interpreted the agreement to mean. All I can say is what it seems to imply to me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 16:56:49
I know of no hard fork proposal that could achieve consensus on that timeframe, no.
Maybe a magical fix-everything solution will be invented tomorrow (it's possible), but even that would require 6+ months of effort to get it in Core, and another full year or more to deploy, since we're talking about a hard fork. So the timeline doesn't make sense even if one assumed there was an acceptable solution (there isn't).
EDIT: The devs that signed the HK document aren't liers. They promised code availability 3 months after, which is when I would start the timeline I described above.

Didn't find it. Did you leave it after left, OP? Or willing to share one more clue?
Thanks for the walk at least. It was an enjoyable outing and a great day to spend on the wharf.

The commitment would not be useful to SPV clients. Indeed the whole differentiator of lite clients is that they do not validate the witness. For full nodes it doesn't matter where it is because the full node sees the whole block. 
And it is 32 bytes per Merkle branch. So e.g.  When feeding inputs into a hardware wallet it is per input, multiply by the number of inputs. For every result returned by a bloom filter query. Over slow serial links to hardware signers or satellite data apps. When doing inclusion proofs for future protocols like sidechain pegs, it is transaction data you pay fee on.
I think 32 bytes still matters. Of course keeping asicboost disabled is the bigger argument.

I am not a Bitcoin Core developer, so I don't know.
