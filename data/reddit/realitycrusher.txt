No the idea is to have our own money, and total control over it.

It has a strong future of slowly but surely getting replaced. There is zero innovation in BTC, zero scaling, zero useability as a p2p currency, zero future.
BTC is like an old guy starting to get terrible eyes and being slow, and sadly it seems the technology isn't as far to give this old man some treatment and replacement parts so he can jump around rejuvenated.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:10:46
Why would you even buy a fraction of a BTC, the ship has sailed, invest if you must in something with a future.

They printed money for everyone, to be fair. And also devalued the USD by doing so, which is kinda a double whamy.
All you had to do was check the omni adress and you could basically just buy before the pump and make tons of profit.
Sadly me slowpoke noticed it way too late..
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:30:22
If everyone owned Bitcoin it wouldn't even be usable, it's not even usable now for anything. 
You can't really use it as a currency because it's txs fees are way too high even now after they dropped substantially, because lots of people lost interest in Bitcoin - reflected in price and transactions. 
It's also not a store of value, because it's only good as long people invest in it, which requires intrinsic value and not just more and more people buying in to increase the price, which is the definition of a Ponzi scheme. 
What is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin? It's only value is it's legacy; being used to buy in out of other coins/tokens and for newbies to invest and speculate. Where is the intrinsic value? No one uses BTC for what it was intended and what gave it value; a p2p electronic cash system and currency.
Bitcoin is being garroted and you fucking morons are watching and clapping while posting your retarded hodl memes and advertise this ponzi scheme to others that will someday hate you for making them buy into your shit and losing money.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:23:06
Yeah, but what would be the point of that. The point of BTC is to use it as a currency. Not having to exchagne it to any government currency before paying.

You gotta respect the Hodors though, they keep the price from crashing by their idealism.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:00:52
Yeah, all value is subjective. Intrinsic value still exists. 
I can say the value of Bitcoin is overpriced at this very moment.
You can argue the value of Bitcoin is underpriced or just right or in the future it will become even bigger etc. 
So why do you think a Bitcoin is worth so much money? Because of it's energy needs? Brand name? History? Exchange coin to buy alts? Investment and speculation?
Those are all intrinsic values of Bitcoin, but if i think of the future and the idea of Bitcoin i wonder if it will get adapted as the p2p electronic cash system or if it already reached it's limit and paved the way for new technologies and ideas.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:15:32


Maybe a non working cryptocurrency which costs dozens of $ to transfer money and can take days to weeks to transfer if you are unlucky or didn't pay ridiculous high fees?
There is some serious scaling issues and you say something like that? You are either a bot or stupid.
Bitcoin was intended to be a world wide p2p currency for everyone, especially the poor, not exclusively a god damn store of value for us rich retards in the 1st world.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:38:49
Yeah but the reason they can do that is to invest the money to make money for themselves and you. The reason banks exist is to safeguard your money and insure it, and that basically for free.
And at least in Germany and else we have laws and regulations that your money is save.
The ponzi scheme just means that the more people are part of it the higher the value get, and the value is not derived from anything intrinsic like for instance Bitcoin being used as a currency or as a means of exchange, right now it's not. And sure, maybe LN and tabs or whatever will fix all that, BUT Bitcoin has relatively low intrinsic value for it's price, it's mostly speculation.
So yeah, it's a ponzi scheme as long as it has no real intrinsic value compared to how many people use it as an investment which is the vast, vast majority.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:26:51
why not?
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:03:48
why 6 months and a day?
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:56:07
Well you can call it a pyramid scheme or ponzi scheme or whatever. For all we know Satoshi could have been a illuminati CIAgrey bankster lizard guy who started in his highly evolved scam-consciousness a way to get a fuckton of people into the boat in order to fund the military-surveillance-industrial-war complex of the dark empire.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:22:29
Yeah i don't think it as a scam but as a competing Bitcoin. 
We have seen lots of times that BCH gained value while BTC lost lots of market share. So BCH is basically just waiting for BTC to fail in order to introduce bigger blocks and a working p2p electronic currency to the mainstream with lots of adoption. 
Maybe it will never happen, but i personally wouldn't have a problem with it, as IMO all those 2nd layer "solutions" are way too complex and not elegant. I prefer simple solutions to simple problems and i can't see for the love of god how 8mb are too high demanding of internet/computer speeds and infrastructures.

When i was buying stuff on the darknet Bitcoin was amazing, but in those times the transactions fees where like BCH today or maybe a bit more, but it wasn't noticeable when sending it to the Silkroad.

@_date: 2018-01-21 18:54:15


Unlikely, but if it should happen in some kind of alternate universe it would be the great. Right now it's getting garroted by the bankers and people in charge.


Yeah the blockchain technology is an invaluable idea, and i don't think Bitcoin will change fundamentally which means something better will replace it if it doesn't scale. 


Said the guy with the opinion. I am an early adopter, i probably used it long before u did so shut the fuck up you egomanical clown.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:10:26

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:13:37
Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash (or any other cryptocurrency you can actually use). They are useable as a currency and work great to do transactions, you pay very little fees as it should with Bitcoins. Bitcoin can't handle the many users anymore and that's why your tx takes days. Sadly Bitcoin is very slow to scale. 
Look at the unconfirmed transactions, yours is in them and depending how much fees you paid it will be stuck until the miners clean the mempool. Sadly the miners mine the ones with the highest fees first and yours is probably somewhere in the middle or lower middle.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:36:42
S2X was off by one, not BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:01:16
If BCH was used like BTC it would still only use 3mb of their 8mb cap. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:43:00
Did you call your bank? Call your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:45:32
But if BCH had the transactions like BTC has right now and even in peak it would easily handle it. There is room in the transactions per block, because there is so much room for growth. And also without high fees, that was the whole point of the fork to force the non-adressed scaling issues of BTC.
If BCH had the same transactions per second BTC is having at it's peak it would at the highest maybe need 2.5 - 3mb blocks.
And don't get me wrong. If BTC technology development grinds to halt like it did the last years and becomes a pure store of value i have no problem with it, but another coin will have to fill that place of useability.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:37:23
Jump in with 10 or 50 or 100 or however much you can afford, if you wanna trade you can use that to get experience without much risk. If you want to hodl, then hodl. U never know how valuable it is in a year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:03:21


Sure. But before we have micro or even milli payments, we need a system that can handle normal transactions. BTC can't even handle that right now with their ridiculous scaling problems.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:59
But you can also buy money with gold, or stock or anything else?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:59:32
To be fair Bitmain is taking BCH exclusively for many months. I think the last time they shortly accepted LTC and BTC was in summer.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:17
Yeah but it is very well possible that they increase the price in order to dump it later when they have their shorts, right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:54:39

It's weird, on Bitfinex it was first exactly on 19500, then 19600 now a lil up and down and back at 19600. 
Interesting how some players can hold the price.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:37:53
But lots of old developers of BTC think that BCH is what BTC should ahve been. So if you believe that or not there is a point for BCH being Bitcoin which it is, just with bigger block caps and without scaling issues.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:25:18
4th party
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:28:34
Yes BCH is BTC, it's a direct fork from the orignal chain and it follows stronger the guidelines of the block chain aka "Satoshis vision" or whatever. 
It scales, is usable, has very low fees and is kinda stable in price.
It's a great altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:03:03
So neither BCH nor BTC is any good long term?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:29:33
Why do you want off chain solutions from 3rd parties? On chain is everything. It's secure through PoW or PoS and it offers everything you want from BTC, just better. 
The future will be atomic swaps down the main chain (BTC) towards other chains, depending on needs of privacy (Monero), speed (LTC?) or cheap transactions (BCH).
Just imagine a combined and united crypto world, where you can change your BTC to any coin you want through atomic swaps.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:23:18
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:29:09


Well they are Bitcoin forks. And Bitcoin is open source and the people decide which chain to follow, until now only BTC and BCH are successful. But what does success say about the technology? If it was about technology BTC shouldn't even be in the top 5.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:44:00
You realize that BCH has cent fees for millions of USD? It's incredibly cheap and uses exactly the same technology just with bigger blocks.
All you need is bigger blocks and boom you have no problem with scaling, AT ALL.
Don't get stuck in one coin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:39:29
Well it kinda is a pyramid scheme right. People using it gives it value, if people stopped liking it it would break down. 
And considering that BTC is basically un-useable due to high fees and unconfirmed tx what is the actual useability of BTC which gives it value in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:32:18
Idk, what happens bro?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:49:58
Good luck, will probably take a day or two. 
In the future you should use LTC or BCH or anything else to transfer funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:41
If you like to gamble why don't you trade it? You can sell when its high and rebuy when its low, or try out various altcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:25
But in the past BTC didn't have to share hashrate with Bitcoin Cash, so there might sooner or later come a point where it simply can't recover anymore, doesn't it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:18:31
You should get the hookers before you go down.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:04:57
Right now 8mb blocks or 4mb are the next thing to do. Long overdue actually. And ofc they are not the end solution, as they have to scale with infrastructure and computers (Internet speeds, CPU, RAM etc. for Full Nodes).
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:15:46
The higher something rises the higher the possiblity people with take profits, depending on relative price changes, general psychological state and liquidity it's not that hard to predict when the price will drop or rise again. Also the Elliot Wave Theory helps a ton from my experience. The bigger problem is to understand and control ones own emotions like greed or fear, FUD and FOMO.

@_date: 2017-12-31 22:13:20
See, you nailed it right there. I "lost" tons of money from selling to early and partially missing the big gains like you exactly mentioned.
But the thing is, i also didn't lose any money from the November and Christmas dips and flips, because i had all my money in BCH at those times, and also XRP the last days.
For me this is the safe way to invest, and to learn how to not get out to early is something i am developing and working on.
Sure it's not perfect, although for me it worked and is a learning process, and i increased my portfolio by 1300% in the last 2 months.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:21:45
Yeah but if you look at the last days with enourmous and unprecedented gains, this could very well have been the big players. And considering the futures have a daily limit of 10% variancy before it closes, they could just do a slow squeezy.
The last couple days and maybe even weeks or months could have been saturating the market and creating a media frenzy (which we have seen both) and now when the futures on cboe BTC futures goes live they slowly dump their coins so the market loses value over the next days or weeks. All they need is a 10% lose every day, more is not possible anyways because of the regulations.
I don't see how this is not possible. I don't know if it's the truth or just some conspiracy, but why is it not possible? So if it is possible why shouldn't they do it? Those people move trillions and are in the money business for decades, with all the money and tools and people and experience you can imagine.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:00:02
Not really.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:56:32
No the miners mine what is most valauble to mine. If one mine is not giving enough money they close and go to the next. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:59:01
Bitcoin is IMO doomed mid to long term. Better get out and/or diversify.
 If you can't use it, it's worthless, it's not even a store of value anymore, to the contrary. 
Lets give Bitcoin the good bye it deserves, it was great and it's too old. All it's children are now growing up and overtaking him.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:19:26
Oh, didn't see your question there.
It might be stuck forever. Depends if the mempool gets cleared up by the miners, you need to check the first link i sent you. The problem is that miners are now also switching to BCH which makes things even worse because even less people clear the mempool where your transaction tx is inside, so it will take even longer and it will also take longer because  many people will replace-by-fee their initial transaction with higher fees (what you could too) and they will get mined first by the miners. 
So this could all spiral into higher and higher fees and from your 0.005BTC you send + fees you could be left with 0, because fees could be higher than your transaction is worth. 
Basically you are fucked if the mempool doesn't cleared up, as it might never clear up. But that is just speculation and FUD on my side.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:10:49
Times are changing though and it is not guaranteed that BTC  will grow as it did before. It hit it's limit and is unusable, trust is as low as i have ever seen it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:06:33
So why exactly would BCH have similar fees if they had the same transactions BTC has now? I don't see the problem here and centralization is it for sure not as long as miners run nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:51:04
Lol u paid 0.003 for a  0.002 BTC transaction?

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:33
Too many transactions for BTC to handle. Depending on how high fees you paid it takes between hours to weeks. You probably didn't pay a lot of fees, do you know how much?
BTC is broken.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:42:38
That's true i guess. Although depends where you are. If you are close to many gold exchanges and banks you can probably quite swiftly get your stored gold and transform it to whatever you want.

@_date: 2017-12-05 14:01:06
The truth will make you free. But i appreciate the sentiment.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:53:37
Yeah, i think hodling has it's time and place, holding BTC was probably the best investment without having to do any work for the last million years or ever. And i think that time is mostly over for Bitcoin. I love Bitcoin, but it never scaled and i am not sure LN or anything else will ever fix the issues. No one uses it in their everyday life and adaption at this stage is a complete joke, which merchant or payment processor would use something that is so expensive, slow and volatile? It's basically the coin for bankers and rich people that wanna move large sums of money with high security. And maybe that is it's future use case.
Atm i got little confidence and hope for BTC, and i have lots of hope for the future for all other coins. I trade basically on the future, and i don't see it atm for BTC.
But who knows, maybe LN and the other stuff will change that and innovation will come back, right now BTC is only alive because of it's contribution to the cryptomoney and blockchain world, it's name, history and because it's used as the coin to buy other coins.
Why do you think Bitcoin has a future? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:27:55
No one says we should make block increase as the go to solution, but block size should be in accordance with infrastructure like internet speeds and hardware requirements to run full nodes. 
In times where oyu can run a 4mb full node on a Berry this is more than ridiculous. It rather seems BTC is internet money for the rich which don't care paying 200-500 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:12:02
Yes invest before it goes to the moon.
Don't invest the bubble will burst soon.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:41
Yeah but you talk about 10gb blocks at this moment of infrastructure and hardware.
At this point 4-8mb blocks are not problem at all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:36:26
I think Bitcoin has become a very risky investment as people lose hope the issues will get resolved. Even LN seems like a drop in the ocean. 
I can't sleep anymore when i put my money in it because i always fear that the whole thing falls down. Just look at the unconfirmed transactions, they aren't even clearing anymore and a simply quarter kbyte costs you 50-150$.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:12:40
What you need segwit for? Just increase blocksize to 4mb-8mb and BTC can scale to 50k a coin and give some room for development like off chain solutions.
But i guess then BTC would just be BCH and lose the war. So maybe that's why BTC isn't scaling, because it would make it pointless because BCH already scaled. 
ALthough it would be interesting who would win if BTC and BCH had reasonably blocks. Probably BCH would lose because of lack of adaption and user base. I think the future is already here and BTC followers just don't know it yet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:02
Well bitcoin.com is run by Roger Ver and he supports BCH right?
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:57:06
"some exchange markets regulations"....
I guess you did not quite understand the news; ie. that it's quite possible that they will ban virtual exchanges. And considering SK is 1/5 of all crypto trading in the world this could wreak havoc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:35:59
But RBF removed the possibility for 0-confirmations, which small payments and else can and were used for. 0 confirmations are ofc not safe, but they have their place for merchants or companies who won't care if 0,X% of their transactions are faulty. After all everyone can decide themselves how many confirmations are save for his service or needs.


Why even more spam?
And yes it would be significantly lower. 
Look at the 12th November for instance, 2,5x transactions but over 63x the fees.


Well and how long are they taking? How high are the fees? How usable and practical is it?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:35
But the discussion about block size increase was going on for years, if no consensus can be achieved - and hell; look at BTC and its un-usability for not only months now but longer and no real solution in sight - than a fork was not only sentiment, but necessary. 
And what has changed from the original idea of Bitcoin? BTC changed a whole lot with RBF, failed Segwits and other, while the only thing BCH has done was increase the block limit to a reasonable amount of 8mb in accordance with infrastructure (internet speeds for nodes), growth (user adaption) and technological progress (hardware to run full nodes).
If BTC had the blocksize of BCH there would be no issues. And in my opinion and many others who know a whole lot more than me and have been in it from the very beginning, Bitcoin Cash is carrying the idealistic torch that BTC has abandoned. Like anyone in the 3rd world is ever going to use BTC as their future money. Transfering and storing BTC is only reasonable for rich people who move large sums.
It seems more like BTC is now successful for carrying that Royal name which isn't even usable anymore. How is that the King of Cryptos? Not for long. It's unusable as such. A simple size limit of 2-4mb should have been implemented years ago, which even a god damn Berry can run a full node.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:08
Doesn't really matter how high value of a transaction, fees are calculated by the size of the transaction which is typically 250 bytes.
edit: you paid if my math is correct 171-180, which means in the next 4-143 blocks or 40-1500 minutes. You could rebroadcast it with a higher fee, although that doesn't make sense if the transaction value is low.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:41:19
Bitmain miners can  only be bought for BCH for many months. I think the last time you could pay with Litecoin and Bitcoin was in the Summer.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:55:35
Just use BTC as a store of value and BCH or LTC or Monero etc. for transactions and payments. BTC is the main chain, BCH is the 2nd layer, LTC the 3rd..
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:19:37

Well my BTC blockchain folder which is now 153GB took me a couple days with my 16mbit internet. Although it was only running when i wasn't needing the bandwith.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:28:18
Don't the bigger blocks also work with lots of traffic? 4x as many txs, mempool like in BTC could never happen at the same scaling we have right now with BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:12:02
Ah okay that's an interesting insight, thank you.
But that upload figure is only when the node runs 24 hours right? Does it have to run all the time? And also 8MB blocks are max capacities, even if BTC/BCH was flipping right now BCH would have only about 2MB blocks. Full 8MBs would probably only realized in many months or years and at that time infrastructure would have increases so even the average Joe can run his node on pies.
At the moment BCH for me personally (but i am noob and might think otherwise in the future) seems like the better technology. It's not only a store of value, but also useable as fiat money to buy your legendary coffee and what have you.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:17:25
But only if the mempool isn't clogged up because tx/s died down and mining is running on 90-95% due to BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:15:48
Care to explain what you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:43:30

Well, thankfully there are a ton of other coins with low fees and fast tx.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:09:48
Yes i agree. I made a ton of money by trading BCH and i think it's superior to BTC, because everything is on-chain and it's properly scaled. But i can see the fear of people if BCH continues to increase blocksize without considering the rest of the world. Let alone it's pretty centralized through miiners.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:41:44
Not everything.

For me one of the big and revolutionary pros was it being a P2P currency, without banks and governments in between. Especially considering how banks have fucked us we should not be dependent on them and reduce their power and increase our individual powers.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:13:03
I don't understand why a Raspberry should be the scale of blocksize evaluation.
There are billions of people that don't even have a computer, so there can always - unless more technological progress and widespread is achieved - a percentage of people running nodes, why should everyone run a node right now? And that is only humans, shouldn't by that logic ad absurdum every mammal or animal run a node?
In todays world only a couple hundred of private banks hold all the money, shouldn't it already be a big step towards more decentralization if only couple million individuals have nodes?
Or would this not be enough for a stable and resilient system?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:04:30
Do you think there is should be a fixed limit forever or do oyu think there should be increases in blocksize if the time is ripe, just not now? What would be your current limit?
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:22:43
It's a scam because the guy lost money? How is that even possible, the price is still way higher than before the pump. Probably bought in at 2k..
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:46:26
Scaling issues?
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:13:46
Yeah well, reasonably bigger blocks wouldn't cause much centralization and take a huge load off. People run full nodes on a pie, if you can run a 1GB block on a 4core 30mbit 16gb laptop you can run 2,4 or 8 mb easily on a netbook, laptop or future pies (and they an handle 2mb already).
You know what a Dash node costs? It costs half a million euro. And a laptop that costs a couple hundred of euros at best is centralization? Bitch pls, the reason why BTC doesn't want slightly bigger blocks over time is for sure not because of centralization.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:22:54
Well it will return, even if the price drops more it will still be more valuable and miners mine the most valuable coins AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:00:33
Ok i get it now i think. I made a mistake calculating.
The fastest private internet where i am costs 50€ per month and has a maximum of 50mbit upstream. 
This would mean 22.96h per day for 500GB per day. 
But this is the fastest internet i know off and is max speed, real speed could only be 35 or a minimum of 15mbit.
So the absolute maximum would barely be able to keep up every day (22,96h of 24hours a day..).
What upstream speed do you have in Japan?
So yeah, RAM, CPU and HDD space might not be that much of an issue IMO, but internet speed are the bottle neck. [And if we look we have global average connections speeds of only about a couple mbit/s](
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:07:32
I don't think people that sell BTC to buy BCH are trolls; it's the free market.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:46:19


Do you people in the US have no flat rates? I can get 32/100/200/500 mbit flat for between 20€ to 60€ per month, unlimited.
So the new raspberries can't yet handle 8MB? What about future generations? Considering the maximum block size wasn't even used 1/6 of capacity at the 2500$ high couple days ago it 's probably not even needed right now and until it is needed there are enough Raspberries that can handle it easily. 
In the meantime an old laptop can potentially do the same, right?
edit: do you know how much RAM you need for BCH at 8MB avergae block?
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:20:17
Which is a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:25:13
Except when you can get more bitcoins by trading the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:03:19
What you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:35:02
But RAM is not a problem and disk space isn't either, bandwith can be an issue in some countries, but it still possible for lots of normal people to run nodes, even today and with max. average blocksize of 8 MB?
So how is it on the edge? I know i ask lots of questions, but maybe do me this last favor and tell me why you see it on the edge at 1.7 MB? Have you made the experience yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:55:55
I made a threat on r/btc, they said your figure is not really representative because you have 130 connections and you upload way more than you have to. 8MB blocks would only need 1.15GB per day.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:53:10
You need 50mbit upstream to run fully capped 8mb blocks, but even if we had 8mb limit BTC it would only use at PEAK 2-2.5mb of 8mb blocks. Even fully loaded 8mb blocks internet speeds with 50mbit costs in Germany 50€ a month.
So why not 2mb/4mb blocks so the average internet speed for the top 50 countries can run nodes as average joes?
Decentralization is as important as scaling, so why not slowly increase scaling, we don't have 56k modems anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:21:59
Yeah, but in your fractioned off group you have the majority. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:17:38
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:15:36
But wouldn't it have many-fold more transactions if people used BTC to buy their everday coffee and else? It is exactly not used for that reason and the high fees right? It's more a store of value which then uses other coins or off chain solutions?


Why is that? Wouldn't the average block size rise the more transactions and usage it would get? 
For instance at 12th November where BCH was at 2500 block size increased to 1.3MB and dropped after the load was dropping. So potentially it didn't even reach 1/6 of it's capacity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:32:02
I'm a noob myself, but i think it's because the mempool is overloaded from the recent events.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:30:52
There was just recently a big dip?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:42:44
I'm not sure, but i think in about 10 hours when BTC gets more profitable to mine again the mempool should get cleaned up because loits of mining power will go back. So from then it should probably not take that long anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:58:20
But a scare could. Look at the 30m Tether "hack". Imagine 600m or any other big news (true or untrue). 
It's like the highways in LA, all goes well until people wanna drive home on thanksgiving, suddenly nothing works anymore. 
2mb or 4mb are really not too much to ask without too big negative effects. Nodes and centralization would still be fine and the biggest bottleneck would be less of a bottleneck. Hell you can run a full 1mb node on a Raspberry..
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:05:41
Good point. Although why is there even a need for centralized off chain stuff? We already have that with banks and credit cards?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:06:31
Yeah rich people fast pass..
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:01:04
Well BCH average blocksize is about 50-100kbytes, while BTC is a constant 1MB.
And BCH has 100-170 tx while BTC has 1700-2000 transactions per block.
So this reflects the relation of block size and transactions, 10-15x the transactions and 10-15x the blocksize of BCH.
The only big difference AFAICS is that BCH has a block limit of 8MB while BTC has 1MB? If BCH was used as much as BTC is today it would produce average block of about 2MB probably?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:12:42
10% adaption
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:17:51
Yes and thanks BCH for the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:43:28
But BCH had no scaling difficulty in the last run up to 2,5k per coin while BTC's mempool was clogged up for couple days and people couldn't even get their transactions through for that time. 
Or were there any performance/scaling problems i am not aware off?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:36:58
I guess my argument is that it's impossible for every human already to run a node. So we can either fix that issue by slowly and carefully scaling BTC (or BCH) so it stays useful not only as a store of value but as a P2P currency for everyone, OR we can just create side chains and 2nd layers which monopolize and decentralize it another way and also add unnecessary complexity. 
Again, i might be wrong on that, but shouldn't the blockchain grow and advance and adopt itself instead of metastasizing to off chain solutions? That's seems like a devils bargain and leads to even more fragmentation and centralization.
I am a way below average wealthy German, i i could easily run a BCH node. Tens of or probably hundreds of millions of people could right now at this point run a BCH full node.
At this moment of understanding i prefer that over a couple thousand banks and 200 central banks.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:10:11
Just a guess, but maybe Chinese miners sell their coins on Korean exchanges because of the laws in China.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:00:28
Yeah but why side chain if you can do in on-chain? And for the time being BCH seems fairly adequate for what we need in crypto-currency?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:24:55
So you think that no matter what currency is in demand it will become un-usable in some aspect? I don't really understand, maybe you can shed some light. I kinda prefer BCH atm, it's technology seems to work not only for big investors, but also to purchase your coffee, and isn't that what we always wanted in a crypto-currency?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:22:46
I'm sorry, but in this state of technological development and infrastructure we could easily handle 2mb, 4mb or 8mb. That's not a problem with the internet speeds and computer specs. 
So there is nothing against bigger blocks. Sure, it's not the long term solution to all problems, but i don't get the argument why BTC can't have bigger blocks to increases tx/s, reduce mempool and not let a disaster like happend earlier in November where people can't transfer their coins for DAYS occur again.
A little Raspberry could handle 2mb blocks, a 150€ netbook or notebook can handle 8mb.
A Dash Masternode costs half a million €, but 50-200€ for a BTC node is too much? Not every child from Africa needs a BTC node. We just need broad coverage, instead of a a couple hundred central banks like we have now. Even if only 1% of humanity could run a node, this would already be more than enough.
Or do i miss something i did not think of?
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:05:36
I don't see a problem if BTC had 2mb blocks, this would buy time to keep the streets open, and develop and implement off-chain solutions without too much centralization considering node block propagation infrastructure.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:09:28
Bitcoin would be valueless without the internet, functioning power grids, cheap electricity for miners and a large userbase. 
What you need in such a situation is a large group of people (best military), weapons, water, food and technology/tools and solar is a good one.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:15:42
Oh fuck off asshole.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:07:41
Nevermind. I made an error earlier this day. It seems even with the fastest private internet and only with max speed i could barely upload 500GB per day which a BCH node would require.
So i guess i see the problem now. It's too much centralization for the average global internet speeds. And this is the smallest bottleneck. RAM, CPU and HDD space not so much.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:40:38
Well BCH is kinda nice because it has low fees, fast transactions and recently, even stable block time without EDA triggering.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:55:41
Well you kinda are an asshole, i am a noob and trying to understand it. You for sure aren't helping with your zero contributions. Why don't you use your energy for something more useful? What are the scaling issues BCH had?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:49:35
I don't see the problem. Just profit from the pump?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:12:33
I think the high fees are a serious problem. A cryptocurrency should be able to have very low trans fees, that's really not too much to ask in the grand scheme of things to get a useable currency.

@_date: 2017-11-24 13:47:18
I personally think ETH is safer and has more growth, but that's just my laymans opinion. But BTC is pretty safe too, although it's possible it could lose lots of value because it doesn't have much use anymore except being store of value and the maincrypto you can exchange other cryptos. But i think it all depends if BTC scales or dies from not being able to handle growth.
But my advice is worth nothing, i am a noob and i don't trade much.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:31

@_date: 2017-11-20 11:00:43
155 GB is too large for a node? I can run that on my 12 year old laptop.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:14:46
So about 25mbit upstream right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:25:00
Yes i have strong tendencies for BCH since i got a bit deeper into Bitcoin, it seems like the obvious solution to the current problems. That's why i am doing research and creating discussions and ask questions, to understand it better and my opinion changes depending on my knowledge, i haven no problem with changing my mind. 
And it doesn't seem to increase block size too much which from what i understand leads to problems like power of miners and centralization of nodes. 8MB nodes can be used by average people with an old laptop. 
And yes it's a stop gap solution, but how is that bad to buy more time in order to develop side chain solutions while the main chain runs smoothly? It's not like a 64MB blocksize limit which would create vast problems because most people couldn't run nodes anymore, propagation speed issues due limiting upstream and hasher nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:31:06
So your main concern about bigger blocks, lets say 8MB limit, is that they would create centralization and solve not the underlying scaling issues which can only be solved by off-chain solutions?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:48:24
Yeah but almost no one in the world has a connection like that. The average upstream is not even 1mbit in the top 50 countries, it's more like 0.5-0.3mbit.
And sure, not every child in Africa needs to run a full node, but at least the average first world retard should be able to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:06:03
That's an amazing design.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:02

@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:33
Alright, thanks for the slap on the head.
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:14:33
Yeah but even if BCH/BTC flipped places the BCH average blocksize would only be 2MB with lots of room for scaling and until that we would have infrastructure so even the average Joe can run his own node.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:17:25
So you think everyone should be a node? Why should everyone be a node and not just one out of 20 or 50 people, smaller businesses etc.? I have never un a BTC node until a couple weeks ago for a couple days, and i don't really ahve a reason to continue running a node.
With my crappy 2mbit upstream i would need (if i am not mistaken) 14 hours to upload 10 GB of data. That would be enough to be a full bCH node right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:26:03
Yeah but uploading those blocks is the bottleneck. You can barely upload 8mb blocks with 50mbit upstream.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:41:22
Yeah but it's a majority in their echo chambers.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:44:33
Let me know when your transaction goes through, if you find the time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:02:15
YOu can use BCH or Litecoin for that.
But i don't have a problem with 2mb or 4mb blocks for BTC. But i am also an idiot and don't know much about the tech. So i let this be decided by the developers and big guys in the industry. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:38:44
The hubs.

Bitcoin Cash isn't bad, it has 8mb blocks which doesn't clog up the mempool and allows way more tx/s. 2 weeks ago for instance Bitcoin got so clogged up that people couldn't transfer their BTC for days! So there is a problem which BCH tries to solve on the cost of decentralization.
But you can make lots of money when the price goes up (price pumps). But you better sell it or be smart about it, because tendency is that the price will go down again. Although the price has risen 5 times in the last month from 300 to 1500... 
I trade all coins, don't get too absorbed in all the emotional politics and hate between and and rather try to understand the tech.

Well the whole body replaces itself every 7 years.

But wasn't it also meant for poor people to send and get money around the world? I mean we in the 1st world don't really have a problem with that, but how is some poor person in the 2nd or 3rd world gonna use it with those extreme fees who hasn't that kind of money? It's unusable for them, and to them we are the 1%.

Tbh, i think BCH should be the 2nd layer of BTC, and LTC the third layer. And actually, it already is.

Thanks for the imput, gotta check out Andrew's Pitchfork then :D

The bear cycle ended at 6k. Although now it might have peaked again and might be back to a bearish market again.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:58:37
Well long term it's probably a good investment. Next couple weeks and months will be bloody though, IMHO.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:10:08


That's a good question.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:39:39
Nono, just wait until it's at 10k. The more time you wait the better.

I really don't understand why people would use those electronic machines, it's pretty obvious they can adjust the parameters in order to make it extremely unlikely anyone wins something, while making them addicted with little bait wins.

And lots of impolite aggressive and passive aggressive flaming. So talk to someone else.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:40:10
Well i mean just paying capital gains tax or whatever legally, but as little as possible if wanting to cash out. I just wondered why you don't want to cash out. I rather pay tax than have it laying around in my electronic wallet forever without use.
And yes, i am German, so it's also a bit different here.

A kilo of gold cost like 35k or something.

I'm talking about possibilities, not beliefs.
And it is trading on Bitfinex? It doesn't even exist yet, how can it be credibly traded and valued? We will see when the fork goes online. 
And i am not so sure that S2X is already done, they have huge backup of various factions, from miners to the industry and also a substantial user base (20-50% in polls).
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:13:00
Idk, when i started i had lots of success with it in bullish markets.

U should sell until the still have some worth. The bubble is bursting right in front of our eyes.

People who hodl'd the .com bubble on it's height would have needed 14 years to get back even on NASDAQ.
Contrary to Bitcoin the NASDAQ is not just one asset but an industry indicator of the greatest economy in the world with tons of corporations.

So blockchain.com and blockchain.info are both valid blockchain sites? Bcs one shows Blockchain Luxembourg S.A.R.L certificate and blockchain.com does  and is .com instead of .info
edit: nvm they are the same
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:39:09
You don't know that. Quite possible that BTC will die and S2X will replace it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:58:55
Most likely? How can you be so sure? All the people who bought in the last couple months and semesters are not all hardcore BTC fans but use it as an investment. 
This (hostile) takeover by the big players could very well create a paradigm shift. And they have a lot of backing of the industry, miners, developers and substantial percentage of the base.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:39:12
Jeez i still have some BCH's, i wonder if i should wait a bit for it to get pumped or get some kind of upwind...
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:08:27
We are taking about OP, who probably has half million or more. 
In his situation i would totally get myself an apartment or house. Maybe diversify investment and invest in immobiliare, gold, rare metals, stock like Tesla or SpaceX or other growing industries/companies.
Most of it i would probably hodl in Bitcoin, as the growth is just unbeatable at this time, but i would probably partially diversify my wealth in order to reduce risk in case Bitcoin fails. And i think as long as you invest your money you also don't have to pay capital gains tax or other taxes, or way less.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:41:34
Is blockchain.com fake and blockchain.info true?
I don't understand this post fully.

Noob question; can't you just copy the .blk data to make synch faster (in case you have a portable HDD or can transfer the data fast via LAN or something).

I always had that feeling. Care to elaborate?

Pyramids of Giza are also a pyramid scheme and a representation of civilization. The lower classes work for the higher classes. Literally capitalism.

Well if i had a couple millions like OP or whatever i would totally cash out (partially) to buy myself a house and car. I would get a tax professional/lawyer and find the best way to do it legally and pay as little war taxes as possible. What am i gonna wait for? To become a billionaire when i am 70? Or lose everything in case Bitcoin goes down?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:36:38
Good point. So what would be the best solution in your eyes? I guess if you just wanna buy a couple consumer goods it won't matter anyways. But if you wanna buy something like a car, house or cash out relatively large sums it will get more tricky.

So the hacker disabled 2FA somehow in order to login into Bitstamp without having to provide 2FA?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:17:17
It means you can just make up cost basis. You could claim you bought  when in reality you bought in at $50.
Although this only works if your official bank account somewhat reflect that investment, because all those are monitored and can be backtraced.
And you could always claim you bought the BTC at localbitcoin in cash or privately.
You hold the power with bitcoin, just don't be stupid.
