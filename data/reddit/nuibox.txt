Your transaction fee will be about 5 pennies or .0001 btc.  Or if you have very old coins it would be free.  If you don't provide a fee miners will probably include it in a block eventually.

Hi Someone,
 Thanks for the suggestion. I've added a +1 to this item on our internal Feature Request List. We can't promise if we may add support for Bitcoin payments, however your feedback is definitely appreciated.
 Thanks,

Yep, pre mine could work for some things.  But ripple has always stated their pre-mine was to reward themselves.
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:33:48
I'm certainly not going to plug a shitcoin.  But...,  there certainly are several different proof of x ideas to run a block chain.  I will feal a lot safer about owning bitcoins when:
* miners add all valid trans to blocks
* pools stay below 20%
* transaction fees make up a larger part of the mining reward
* we see miners take smaller rewards without trying to modify the block reward scheme
@_date: 2014-06-13 11:57:37
Also, how is ghash profitable with 0% fees?
@_date: 2014-12-17 08:07:34
Then 3d print yourself a bigger throat :)

@_date: 2014-06-16 04:51:44
Will this community you speak of be enough to strong arm greedy minors/pools away from Colluding to extort higher fees or muck with the block reward?
I hope so but I also hope we can get "algorithmic" regulation in place.  The 20% price swing ghash has given us is scary stuff.  It was also an excellent time to buy... I wonder if it will happen again.  I wonder if another core developer will decide to publicly sell 1/2 his coins.  I wonder if the 51% scare will turn some off to bitcoin.

Yeah that would be a nice machine but it seems like a 450 watt ps might leak more electricity than something much smaller.  For a headless always on little machine.

Yes.  I sent 10 or so breadwallet transactions during the test and 1 coinbase transaction immediately after.  The coinbase cleared next block. The breadwallet ones took 3 or 4 hours and all went in the same block.

When you take into account variance of finding a block, isn't more than 5% required to block?

I liked your video. I didn't notice their strange fee pattern until after a few orders.  
I don't think it's a terribly bad thing to have high fees as you ask for steep discounts, but people don't like things that are tricky or unclear.

Is everyone here ok with permissioned ledgers if Patrick is doing it?

Congratulations Peter! You've made it to the vilified and insulted on Reddit stage of bitcoin stardom!
You did seem tired in the interview to me.  You said, "when you have regulators breathing down your throat", instead of "down your neck".  Which made me think of regulators giving someone CPR...

*PeerNova has developed a technology platform that provides immutability and data integrity for use in financial services applications, such as compliance and audit. Inspired by blockchain, our patent-pending technology enables use of immutable ledgers and databases in real-time. Traditional applications of blockchains involve de-centralized ledgers, distributed consensus protocols, and anonymous users. PeerNova’s solution is built for commercial usage by enabling the same type of data integrity and immutability for financial ledgers without needing to de-centralize the ledger or allowing anonymous users to participate.*

I was in your boat before purse exploded.  Now that I've used it 20 times,  I love it.  I'm happy to give people a way to buy bitcoins.  There are people without access to big reputable companies to buy bitcion from.  There are also people with funds tied up in amazon monopoly money.
Also, as more people use purse, the market effect is taking hold and my orders are no longer going at the 30-40%.  (Of course this was when bitcoins were valued at $220 which we all know is stupidly low...)

* Tainted money laundering 
* 80% of bitcoin trading in Yuan
* Huge volatility
* You are trying to get legitimacy: drugs, silk road
* No company is behind bitcoin
* 80% of the worlds trading in general is in Yuan
* The volatility comes with the territory, new asset class, volatility on the decrease
* Different pockets in the world are starting to adopt bitcoin
* For the most part it's a viable asset for normal life
* It's just a public ledger
* Industries are adopting it: stocks, title registration
* Permanent ledger like concrete

No, it's not good publicity. I listened to the NPR show about the last sheriffs office in a similar situation.  It agrevated me that they never  mentioned that these spyware extortionist, although greedy and bad, are making business anti-fragile.  
I certainly hate the idea of other hackers selling private police dept. data to bad actors.  
These offices need security that keeps cops from installing spyware on govt property.
