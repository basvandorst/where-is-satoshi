This would be the ideal situation for the long term, evrybody can agree with that. However the reason for forks, altcoins and ICOs is simply free money...

Bro use coinbase and transfer ur stuff to gdax (same company, instant movement and no fees between the 2) you can limit buy/sell there for 0 fee

Go to Gdax and click on deposit, there you can click your coinbase wallet and then its on Gdax

I use a very interactice App called "BUX". It is developed for people who dont know much about trading and want to make it accesable for them. 
You could check it out, but im not sure it is supported in alot of countrys. 
They charge fee tough wich is is earned back when the bitcoin price rises about 0,9%

Atleast you already have some invested. Would be worse if you would have no BTC yet..

Are you sure about weekend dips? Have you forgotten about a few weeks back where 2 weekends in a row bitcoin went up 500+?
(The first weekend started at $2700)

If you want to actually trade bitcoin and other crytos, it might be better for you to open an account for CFD trading. Altough fees are high, you can open and close them at any moment you want w/o any delay
