coins left to be mined is an excellent idea - ideally it would get the feed online so you you know that actually a block has been mined and transactions made - it doesn't need to by that sophisticated if it adds too much cost though

@_date: 2018-01-07 15:07:54
well, raspberry pi is certainly stretching it but the idea behind bitcoin is that it is supposed to be decentralized and censorship resistant, antifragile. imagine the world decides to ban it. - it would be much much harder to ban something ordinary people are able to run. other altcoins like litecoin or ethereum are not necessarily meant to be designed to work under such conditions.  altcoins are to bitcoin a form of scaling solution and bitcoin is to altcoins a sort of fallback to security.

1) very secure and reliable blockchain to store data on with limited issuance of the underlaying material
2) useful tool in the digital age - it's basically a decentralised database/ledger
I still think Bitcoin is not just a commodity but also money - because you can attach value to the bits on the blockchain it brings something truly innovative gold or other forms of money don't have. It is really a useful thing that can serve as a backbone for the digital economy in the 21st century. It can also improve gold as money, because transparent blockchain can make gold useful in digital form.

I think they have the power but they won't do it. It is futile, Bitcoin is going to survive either way. Yeh, the price would be crushed but what's the point of stoping the blockchain development in the economy and suffer just the negative effects of a black market that would simply not care whether Bitcoin is legal or not anyway. Also banning Bitcoin makes no sense from the perspective of people and would be highly unpopular and not really enforceable - they even can't get people stop taking drugs. Shadow fiat-gold-crypto economy would flourish - remember it is a worldwide thing so market liquidity is plenty.

Also limited blocksize of Bitcoin will force only few large players to do onchain transactions. Not many will use it to hide their tracks so there will not be enough outputs to hide your transactions with CT. And of course you won't be able to afford an onchain transaction with Bitcoin in couple of years. Remember those $30 transaction fees?

Companies like Palantir would disagree, it is their business worth billions of dollars. Services are accountable and will trace the funds to its owner. Public blockchains are well traceable by analytics tools and Bitcoin is not fungible - so it is a sad fact that you can be investigated just because you got your funds tainted.

OK, LN brings some real improvements. But LN is only for buying small stuff. And I have serious doubts about using LN with dark markets for example. So maybe we can say that you can buy small stuff with LN with some privacy. You can't do large transactions with LN so it can't be like a Swiss bank alternative.

Explain how exactly it is better. Bitcoin will never be fungible this way anyway and if not enough people will be using this then it will not be even safe to use because it is optional.

99.99%? are you aware that ethereum has currently about 4x the number of transactions of Bitcoin?
also the size of black economy should be about 15-20%
swiss bank account doesn't mean black market and it is sill to reduce everything to black markets when you want privacy. LN is for paying for small stuff. it's not like a savings account.
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:52:34
Sorry but it has very low chances to happen I think. You are talking about forking Bitcoin, there has to be consensus.
Also what scalability of Bitcoin? It has limited blocksize so it can scale only with LN. You will be able to do an atomic swap with Monero so it will just plug into the LN.

It seems like something akin to war on drugs. People using services operating the pirate way might be blacklisted or additional paperwork needed if people get stuck with such coins. Look at all the tax safe havens like Switzerland - I believe there is no bank or institution that is safe from the USA and their allies.
Look, I don't know how it will all play out but there are certain possible futures and this is one of them. It might me pointless like the war on drugs but there will be new jobs, police forces, jails and other institutions and new laws - I am sure many people would like to boost the economy this way and stop pedophiles as well.
I want to be optimistic, governments have peaked and prosperity will be decentralised in the future.

Tainting your bitcoin outputs by using mixers if illegal is not a good idea. Your wallet might easily be suspect of crime activity. With anon crypto nobody sees that you sent the money to a darmnetmarket and you even don't need to bother with mixing.

If people don't like bitcoin as stock comparison then perhaps the comparison:M2 money that includes a broad set of financial assets held principally by households is valued over 13 trillion dollars suits you better.

Markets are driven mainly by speculation. In crypto markets it applies even more.
Things like getting massive coverage for news media for beating the price of 1oz of gold is usually a sign of the top. It is the result of price rise not a cause of this massive rally.
And what mass adoption? With no scaling or potential 2 different bitcoins out there that will make people first confused and then directed at the next altcoin that will shine.

you are completely disregarding risks to stocks. the thing that will keep stocks up is inflation which will keep crypto up the same way.

so when stocks rise crypto rises even more because the money is looking for more risk with higher reward. there are also scenarios where stocks fall and cryptos rise - just because it didn't happen so far doesn't mean anything. crypto is obviously a good diversifier because it is completely different, doesn't depend on governments , business cycles - claiming it behaves the same as stocks is very weak position.

Harry Markowitz, the father of modern portfolio theory, postulated that the most important aspect of risk to consider is an asset’s contribution to the overall risk of the portfolio, rather than the risk of the asset in isolation.
This means that by including assets with low or negative correlation in your portfolio, you can reduce the overall variance and therefore reduce the risk of your portfolio.
That was all I was pointing out. If you are investing then you have some appetite for risk thus holding crypto as an emerging asset class is prudent, the percentage of asset allocation might be low. Otherwise just don't invest in things at all - but what does that mean? Storing just USD is certainly not risk-free. You can always find scenarios where some assets have qualities that make them prosper in certain times. With crypto the risk reward is still so big that even small allocation can make a difference.
Simply, crypto is an asset class, people will not go to stone age and forget about the digital age. In those times you remember that gold you diversified your portfolio into.

I don't believe that CT could be accepted as a soft fork anytime soon - if ever. Look how SegWit is doing and consider that making Bitcoin anonymous would present a big game changer, transforming it from completely traceable payment system to something obscure that could be used to hide taxes, support terrorism and fund pedophiles.
As a sidechain it would be in fact an inferior solution to dedicated anon coins that is quite late to the market but could certainly find its niche.
My question is what is the difference between the value of mixed bitcoins with current services and these future sidechain ones?
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:20:00

And how exactly are you going to prove that? From 10 years history since Satoshi? Do you at least have some numbers?

yes, you can hold gold in your hand without counterparty risk and no middle man. gold has much larger following than crypto so if you think crypto has a big future it follows that similar values inherit to crypto will be valued - thus gold will shine. it is simple logic. most of us people who were very early to the Bitcoin game valued gold highly because it was better that the fiat paper games. the problem is that gold by itself can't stand alone as money in the 21st century like it used to in the history of mankind. gold needs crypto to create the market i am talking about - it will be a perfect system not possible before.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:21:34
Gold is unique the same way Bitcoin is to other crypto.
Yes Bitcoin has advantages - on the other hand Gold has advantages. They have many things in common.
I don't think there is or will be a top dog money - world is too complex - there are different forms of money that will coexist. The same as there is not only Bitcoin but other crypto as well.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:53:05
yes, that's why it is a good buy if things turn - gold is in a huge bull run for the past decade. i think fiat money has peaked and we need competing currencies and redefinition of how people store wealth. it seems bitcoin and gold are one of the answers.

current utility? the market is pricing in the future and the market is still small if Bitcoin does mean anything in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:37:53
You have trouble following my reasoning. When I said bitcoin is old slow and energy wasting of course I was not comparing it to gold but other crypto. I was arguing that if tradition or network effect doesn't mean anything then Bitcoin will fail because we already have other crypto which is technologically superior.
This is the main point you fail to grasp - that if gold fails, Bitcoin will fail and there is really no reason to value the tradition they represent. If you are consistent with your reasoning, you should sell Bitcoin for Ethereum, Monero and other superior technologies.
I think you just don't understand money.
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:31:43
currently gold is ~55x bigger than Bitcoin by marketcap and is around thousand times older form of money.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:25:45
The same criticism can be applied to Bitcoin - it is old, slow, energy wasting thing - with your logic Bitcoin is going to fail.

I think fiat has peaked and sound money like Bitcoin and gold will gain tremendous value. Thinking that just crypto will win and gold will fade into obscurity seems really improbable. The fact that you can transfer fiat electronically is not enough to save the system when fiat has such a dominant position. Fiat will also not fail into obscurity, that is improbable at least, but will be an important part of the diverse market.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:34:38
That is crazytalk. The Tulip bubble is so overrated. Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem is much more similar to Wall Street and the rise of the stock market. I presume you don't have any mathematical or at least engineering background to understand much about these things anyway - even clever people fail to grasp the concept because they don't know the human psyche and how market works. Also they usually have very poor understanding of what money is. People forgot, fiat money completely skewed the concept.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:59:29
Of course there will be no backing of fiat currencies. I expect just a few blockchains or private companies to offer gold-backed tokens that can be used as payment - goldmoney for example already does this and there are other blockchain projects trying to do this.
Fiat and gold will always be separated from now on, it cannot be reverted.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:31:06
I think you misunderstand what I am trying to say. I am not calling to return to gold standard or create a system based only on gold. On the contrary I am advocating to return to free trade and having honest decentralized system of value exchange in different forms that people are interested in - and gold is something most people give value to.
Crypto can create a token that is backed by physical gold (no need to actually have the ability to redeem it in physical form as you suggest). That is great and is useful for people who want to transact with less friction and store gold easily in a much more transparent way. You cannot deny the fact that such a solution is superior to a centralized database where you can run a fractional reserve without anybody knowing.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:14:54
because with gold you can be pretty sure it has at least around the same value in the comming years. with Bitcoin you pretty much invested in highly volatile, untested and speculative investment that has been here for years, unlike gold which has been here for a few thousand years
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:25:04
if something is a good investment now, it doesn't matter what its price performance has been for the past 100 years. you are just saying that gold has not been a good investment for 100 years - yes - we are about ~100 years into the fiat experiment. I am calling for the end of this nonsense and honest money like gold and bitcoin to rise!
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:56:12
That is a good perspective. Exactly this leads me to believe they have an interest to make gold succeed - there is no point keeping the price of gold so low when they control it and watch Bitcoin steal all the glory. When it becomes apparent crypto is the new money, they will push for gold when the fiat illusion stops working.

"A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. "

World is far too complex to have just one type of money/currency in the future. I think having competing forms of commoditized value is obviously the way to go. Bitcoin will kickstart the next gold move higher. Crypto and technology in general will remove the friction from using gold. But of course I am not saying gold will outperform Bitcoin anytime soon.

Bitcoin will not become illegal in China. There will be way for them to cash out.
Visa is just a simple payment system. Bitcoin is money so you may compare those $2billion per year in miner revenue with the cost of running a fiat money system.
It really doesn't matter if it is 1800BTC or 10k, that is just some parameters for the system. It means nothing, the market adjusts.
Bitcoin is not evidence that power is wasted the same way gold is not just an evidence oil was burnt. Why was oil replaced by what you call computer power? Because what really underpins the technology behind Bitcoin is Mathematics and laws of the universe. Not some bureaucrats operating printing presses (and this is even the nicer way to look at things).

I have been involved with computer technology for almost 20 years and am a computer professional and can say that blockchain is special. It is like buying a claim on a product of labour on robots that will be made in 20 years. I am thinking as a contrarian - so yes, there are risks and it is a speculation. I am still strongly convinced that it is a smart move to buy some Bitcoin rather than Apple. And I like Steve Jobs, a bit :) The risk/reward is still just great. It is a entirely a new asset class and it is here to stay - how can anybody ignore that?

@_date: 2017-10-18 19:06:01
You are basically trying to say that money can't be deflationary. Really? Now I would need an elaborate explanation **why not**.
Take fiat USD - it's a very bad money and good currency. The value part could only have been found in bonds or stocks - these are what you call speculations - and they are making all time highs as we speak... crypto can be a far better currency and also money in one package without the counterparty risk and in the long run, no speculation, real money as gold used to be. Just realize that in 20 years or so, crypto will be so mature after the emission slows, services get developed speculation stalls. The blockchains will be up and running. 
Maybe it is time to start worrying about traditional companies like Facebook or banks and their shady business models. These things could get obsolete fast. Even governments can... 100 years? What investment except gold can even be thought about on such long timeframes?

There is not going to be a growth of value in government money - it is already like 99% of everything and the trend is ending when looking at things from really long term perspective.
Look at stock market - everybody is in and looks like a huge bubble with no fundamentals. Looking at Bitcoin I can see a great hedge to this mess. It's not like you have options left - gold, bitcoin and ... that's all I guess. Sure you can play with silver or Monero too.

The reality is that if you don't own a significant portion of your savings in an ETF you are financially incompetent - and missing on huge gains as well. The stock market is in a 10 year old bull market where many stocks went 10x the value - with an ongoing deflation/stagflation and near zero interest rates.

It doesn't really matter who invented it or in what year. The first computers also didn't immediately impact anyone except a few. The consequences take much longer to play out even after the technology is developed. 
Bitcoin is the first with the most network effect. I am sure there are other coins which is fine. It's like the USD and the bunch of other fiat currencies.

Investors in Ethereum, Monero and other quality coins would disagree :) Bitcoin is just one of the coins, and putting every egg into one basket is generaly a bad idea. Just because Bitcoin is the largest coin doesn't guarantee anything. It is similar to saying you can buy just Apple (or AOL) and you don't need other tech stocks to diversify.

This is the only explanation I can think of. And not only black market users but generally investors who like the low tax rate and easy mechanism to cash out. Russia might want to make some money being first to offer this. But I am really doubtful about all of this.

To some degree yes. If this address is one from his account and he spends from it - you can look at other outputs that he is using and find the other addresses he posses. From that you can start to get pretty good picture not only how much he has but where he is spending it. You will have a clue that allows you to follow his wallet this way for a long time in the future. Of course you can somehow keep your wallet separated but that is not something people usually put extra care into.

Being pro-crypto actually helps a lot. I think a free market system of competing currencies is the best thing we could hope for. Thanks to crypto we have this huge new asset class and we could upgrade the old money, gold, with it too. Let it float freely and let the people decide what has value.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:01:54
we do not live in a digital world. humans have culture and like variety, it is safer to have a backup as well and a specific solution that fits the problem. look at coinmarketcap, i see some healthy distribution - what sort of lame world is it if you have only Bitcoin? it is never like that in nature.

No, Bitcoin is unscalable because it cannot fundamentaly change. Monero can change and will - implement ZK proofs or any other way to scale. In the meantime - wait for atomic swaps with Monero. And a Mimblewimble sidechain.

"Christian patched the Blockstream Lightning implementation to work on Litecoin, and two hours after Segregated Witness activated on Litecoin, he opened a Lightning channel between lightning clients in Zurich and San Francisco worth about 1.3 US cents.
Once the channel was set up, he transferred 0.00000001 LTC (1 litecoin-satoshi) in under a second. Further test involved another Zurich-&gt;SF payment of 1000 litecoin-satoshi, then a return of the original 1 to Zurich: once a channel is open, an almost-infinite number of further transactions are fast and trivially easy."

Its has been an interesting experiment. But I still think it will eventually end. Fiat money will become less dominant in the future and with the new technology we could more easily store value as humanity sees fit. Thinking that only fractional reserve banking allowed the kind of growth world has seen in 500 years is naive to say the least. Also fractional reserve banking is like a 100 years old experiment, thousand of years before we had gold. the enormous growth the world has seen for the past 500 years is thanks to technology, certainly not central bankers tinkering with rates and skimming of profits.

You are just insulting with no substance. I found out about Bitcoin on google when the market price was non existent. It was just couple of guys starting this thing - a new form of money. I was a fool I didn't put more faith in such a thing when it was exactly what I was looking for at the time.
You show just such simple mindedness in your post about exploiting freedom that Bitcoin can give you that I didn't have a reason not to be arrogant. I really don't need to mince words to make people feel good about themselves.

you have some comprehension problems. I asked you why should it be fork with the same distribution? you also might confuse distribution of tokens with blockchain technology. If you are thinking about the technology then even a fork can improve the old tech and bring new features. Why deny that it increases the whole system's value?

no, bitcoin serves as money and is a solution ready now. ethereum strives for much more and is not ready yet.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:33:40
Those are some good points. On the other hand it is quite hard to believe that such activities haven't left a trail in the blockchain tied with an IP address. Still getting the fiat money out is the real problem, buying ICOs you can't cash out anyway because everything is traceable...

so you think people who stole mtgox coins just cashed in on a couple of exchanges? are you really that naive? 
yes, it is reasonable to believe there is a pile of stolen mtgox coins just sitting there. there is no way to launder that many bitcoins. maybe they bought a ton of coke? i can't find much better way of cashing out. 
edit: anyone can do the calculation how much tons of coke would the hacker have to buy to cash out?

already priced in - we know about this for months now - there will be more and more new members, got it... when there are real solutions to real problems that needs the gas price market in tens of billions - let us know. meanwhile keep thinking of how to scale ethereum so it can actually work without high fees and delays when people start using it
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:32:37
Nobody is aware of bitcoin taint and the fungibility issues. I try to educate people about it but i just get downvoted and ridiculed because apparently most think it is a non issue and think that laundering their coins is safe and rationalize it as their right to privacy. I guess they are set for a crude awakening similar to this story we are talking about. 
People who would have bought these bitcoins OTC would put themselves in the same position and would loose the money the same way.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:25:25
everybody knows bitcoin blocks are limited. i think most even gave up on a possibility of scaling and not forking. are you new in crypto?
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:52:45
Bitcoin is already in the real world usage phase. It is an international value transfer and store of value. It is a finished digital gold. Ethereum is being used only as crowdfunding system for ICOs and speculation.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:42:18
not sure if this is the case but - maybe it is time for people to finally realize that bitcoin is not fungible and that tumbling your coins makes them tainted and can result in all sorts of problems. i have been warning about this for years now. be careful - don't exchange good bitcoins for bad bitcoins...
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:19:53
Yes, that is already priced in. What's next?
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:29:44
It seems very unlikely that Bitcoin will get scaling anytime soon.

with hundreds millions $ if you want to make use of it you buy a decent house, buy a boat, buy a couple of lambos full of girls.. even if it is possible to buy directly with coins, it is traceable the same way... what's the purpose of stealing hundreds of millions just to be able to sit on it and withdraw meager hundreds thousands...
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:04:23
This is very naive - there is no problem for authorities to get information from exchanges and track down your IP.
I told you guys, most users have no clue how to hide - interestingly they refuse to use superior altcoins that would guarantee their privacy. Seems like a no-brainer to me to use the best technology available.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:20:03

@_date: 2017-06-16 14:57:00
why assume that any other exchange is different? it is naive to think that other exchanges would not block illegal funds
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:22:05
Do you realize that using mixers can make you flagged as suspicious? It is written in the blockchain that your wallet sent the funds to the mixer. Why would anybody use a mixer and taint their coins if they don't use it for illegal activities? People need to be careful and know about these things.
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:31:58
Nobody says it's fair. You have right to protect your privacy and bitcoin mixers are allowed. Unfortunately you mix your coins with criminals hence many people are watching it. They are watching the whole bitcoin network and analysing - everybody
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:57:53
you can also buy drugs face to face. the point is that using bitcoins for dark markets is difficult to do right and could create problems. using proper crypto that takes care of all that is a no brainer.
if you buy on localbitcoins you have to do it in cash obviously not via wire transfer. the guy that sold the coins could lead the authorities to you very easily - or even more easily if you bought with a phone wallet without TOR, you are easily detected. So no - most people have no clue how to use bitcoin anonymously and is is quite difficult and there is no reason to use it that way.
