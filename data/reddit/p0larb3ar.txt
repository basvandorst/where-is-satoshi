All the blockchain can do is reveal what input addresses were sent to which output addresses. Analysis on the blockchain should not be able to predict all other keys that exist or may exist in your wallet. For that to happen, your random number generator would have to be badly broken.

Bitcoin is also based on technologies that have existed for decades. Bitcoin did not invent C++, SHA hashing algorithms, hash trees or proof-of-work systems. Also, Bitcoin may not be worth billions, but it is worth more than $100,000,000. Furthermore, if Facebook suffers a catastrophic failure, there are obvious steps to rebuild and long-term damage is unlikely. With bitcoin, that is not so clearly the case. If SatoshiDice is causing problems, then the underlying design issues need to be dealt with now, rather than when bitcoins are worth billions.

I'm fine with men doing it too. I just doubt that will generate nearly as much support. I don't see a "Boys Gone Bitcoin" on the sidebar, for example.

Except that scammers aren't going to be dumb enough to use their own bank accounts. They'll use stolen account details and transfer funds anonymously.

[Armory]( allows for multiple wallets as well, and doesn't require patching the official client.

Yes. It is entirely possible to tunnel a VPN connection over Tor. [Example configuration.](

I wish I had a botnet...

I can see your other posts. You seem to be saying that if one address in a wallet is contaminated then they all are, which isn't true. Perhaps I misunderstand your intended meaning.
