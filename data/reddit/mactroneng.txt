It's something to do with how the government/courts can't compel speech, no? I could definitely see how deleting a warrant canary could be seen as equivalent as exposing the secret because you've actively done something, but simply not updating it isn't an action on your part and the government forcing you to update it is compelled speech which has its own set of rules.

Conversely, how do you know that the keys are only in his head or somewhere the police haven't found?

All the trains are constantly running on very precise and synchronized system (on a huge tabletop in his basement or something) that's connected to a battery backup. The timings of the different trains passing different points in their journeys is the encoding of the private key. Should the battery backup fail or someone interrupt the motion of the trains, the private key is lost forever.

I was gonna do this and never got around to it... my loss I guess (not that I really lost anything... I just didn't gain anything).

Serious question: what's considered "enough ammo to protect your possessions"? A thousand rounds? Ten thousand rounds? More?

ARM? Buy a cheap single board computer for wallet creation (and other fun projects).

Fucking hell, I was gonna have money to buy the dip tomorrow

I would think the ultimate goal is to have it recognized as a currency (like it properly is) and then capital gains wouldn't be an issue.

Huh, haven't been following it much. Bought $60 CAD worth like a year ago, between this price hike and my dollar crashing, I've almost made my money back.

If you did that in Ontario at a bar you'd actually be losing money.

Pretty sure Canada has too!

That makes far too much sense for America.

I raise my hand because I did hold but stupidly did so on an exchange that got fucked.
At least it wasn't much.
