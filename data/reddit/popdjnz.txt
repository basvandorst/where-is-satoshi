Forgive my relative ignorance on the subject, but, from the perspective of the buyer, doesn't escrow simply shift the risk of counterparty default from the vendor to the escrow provider? 
If this is the case, then bitcoin escrow is not actually a solution. However, it does open the door to competition between alternative bitcoin escrow providers. Meaning, for example, you could pick a cheap escrow provider, by assuming more risk that they could take either your money or the item you purchased.

By way of qualifications, I work for a hedge fund where I oversee high-frequency trading systems which buy and sell, both long and short, many thousands of times per second.  I know what short-selling is. I am also very pro-bitcoin.
Unfortuantely, none, or very few, of those commenting in this thread actually seem to know much about short selling and how it affects markets. Please be careful not to do the same sort of thing, with respect to misinformation about short-selling, that the media has been doing by parroting misinformation about bitcoin. The more knowledgeable the bitcoin community is, about short-selling or anything else, the better.
Here are some facts:
* Naked short-selling means you have not borrowed, nor do you have possession of, the thing that you are selling. End-of-story. 
* If you are unable to deliver the thing that you sold short, e.g. because you did not borrow it, then you are forced by the exchange or broker to buy it. This is called "getting bought-in" or sometimes "getting squeezed" and it means the short seller is taking a real loss. (Enforcement of delivery is also, by the way, a reason why regulations are necessary.)
* Short-sellers are not attempting to manipulate the market by driving the price down indefinitely. In fact, nearly the opposite is true: short-sellers provide a floor which keeps the thing that is being traded from really tanking. Here's why:
When you buy something, the most you can lose is what you paid for it. When you sell something you don't own, there is no upper bound to what it may be worth in the future. Therefore, there is no limit to what you can lose. This means that short-sellers are far more afraid of an increase in value than a long buyer is of a decrease. The result is that short sellers will buy, to cover their short position and lock in their profit, when everybody else is panic-selling.
This fact about short-selling is not widely understood, by the general public, by the media, or by regulators. It's admittedly, counter-intuitive, but it is in fact true. The worst thing a regulator can do, if they are worried about the price dropping through the floor, is to suspend short selling.
What the high-frequency exchanges will do is help to stabilize the price of bitcoin. That's not to say that algorithmic trading can't over-react (as in the flash crash of May 6, 2010). But that's a different subject.
I continue to be very bullish on bitcoin. Even more so with the high-frequency trading and short-selling that's starting to happen. 
Anyway, thanks for listening.

Your talking points, sir:
* Bitcoin is, very simply, a transparent public ledger that is guaranteed to be true for as long as the exact same cryptography that all banks and governments depend on, continues to work."
* Absolutely ALL of the bad press about Bitcoin concerns what some people have done with this public ledger. The public ledger itself has been truthful throughout, and has never been violated."
* Trust in the Bitcoin public ledger is extremely high amongst knowledgable financial industry and technology professionals."
* The high level of trust in the Bitcoin public ledger is incredibly exciting, especially given the full head-on assault that Bitcoin has been under by the media, banking industry and some governments."
* The implications of what can be accomplished with this self-powered public ledger are staggering. 
This should leave you with some time, and a reasonable framework, for addressing your skeptical audience.

Here is a scenario, where, while obeying all of the rules, and never intentionally selling short, I actually end up doing a naked short sale which I may be unable to deliver:
1. I place an order to buy 100 X's for 1 BTC.
2. My order gets filled and I now own 100 X's and have 0 BTC.
3. I place an order to sell 100 X's for 2 BTC 
4. My order to sell gets filled, so I have 2 BTC and 0 X's.
5. The exchange cancels, or "busts", the fill in  due to a technicality.
6. I am now short 100 X's that I never borrowed and have 3 BTC. 
Lest you think  never happens, here's a recent example from Nasdaq:
*10:46:14 ET Pursuant to Rule 11890(b) NASDAQ, on its own motion, in conjunction with BATS, CBSX, Direct Edge, NSX, NYSE-Arca, and FINRA has determined to cancel all trades in security L. B. Foster Co. (FSTR) at or above $42.98 that were executed in NASDAQ between 09:35:00 and 09:36:00 ET. This decision cannot be appealed. NASDAQ will be canceling trades on the participants behalf.*

Not a dumb question at all. And I believe the answer should help to sort out some of the confusion.
Where things get a bit hairy has to do with trading vs. settlement:
**A trade is a contract**. When I execute a trade, I am promising to exchange something that I have, *or will have*, for something that you are promising to give me.
The SEC calls this promise "reasonable expectation of delivery".
In other words, it's ok for me to sell to you, as long as there is "reasonable expectation" that you will get the thing I've promised to give you.
On regulated exchanges, the buyer is protected in the event the seller is unable to deliver. Normally, the executing broker guarantees settlement and will make good on delivery, even if the seller skips town. (This is not unlike escrow, btw)
Clearly, and beyond any doubt, when trades were being executed on Mt Gox, there was in fact no reasonable expectation of delivery. If Mt Gox had been regulated, they would have been in clear violation, and buyers would have had legal recourse when they were unable to cash out. 
Now this should make a lot more sense with respect to the Blockchain:
**The Blockchain is not a trading system. It is a settlement system.**
If you try to use the Blockchain for trading purposes, you will get guaranteed settlement, provided you wait for a sufficient number of confirmations (e.g. 3). However, this would be very slow compared to exchanges, and would create a lot of extra work for miners and the bitcoin network in general. This approach is basically not feasible, at least not yet.
As the Bitcoin protocol improves and as the network gets faster, the transaction capacity increases and the time to settlement decreases. Eventually, it is conceivable that trading on the Blockchain could become feasible. And if this happens, then it is also possible to completely eliminate naked short selling.
But buyer beware, as the speed of transactions on the Blockchain increases, the velocity of the currency is also effectively increasing, meaning that less currency is required to handle the same volume of buying and selling. This, comrade, will cause the price of bitcoin to go down, not up.
Be careful what you wish for.

Excellent point for Jimmy and Wikipedia, as acceptance of BTC is currently more prevalent among hosting providers. 
There would be effectively 0 friction, and near-0 exposure to BTC/USD volatility, if BTC donations are immediately re-spent on hosting fees for memory, cpu, storage and bandwidth (as opposed to paying employees in local fiat, for example).

Similar experience. I am in the established/moneyed age group and work in finance. I first bought BTC in May 2013 and spend it at every opportunity, which is frustratingly infrequently.
Yesterday, for example, I asked Barry, the owner of the shop that was working on my car, if he'd heard of Bitcoin. Our conversation went like this: 
Barry: "Bizcoin? Yeah, I heard it was bad news."  
Me: "I know, the media is trashing it. But really, it works great and you can save like 2-3% over credit cards and you don't have to be exposed to any currency risk if you don't want to."  
Barry: "I dunno, I got a lot to think about. Bizcoin sounds complicated. Guys like you'n me, we use real money. Know what I'm sayin?"

Bitstamp is in the middle of implementing their disaster recovery plan. They should call it that. Referring to what they are doing as "fully rebuilding our systems from the ground up" means either:
1. amateurs are running their infrastructure
2. there was no disaaster recovery plan
3. english is the author's second language
I am going with  because I like Bitstamp and because being optimistic makes me feel better. Therefore, I am assuming that by "rebuilding" Nejc really means "re-deploying". Of course, I'd prefer if it was "booting up." 
Honestly, I think what he's saying is that they do not trust the compromised environment and need to keep it as-is for forensics, and therefore they need to bring up a fresh (untainted) copy elsewhere. A few days seems reasonable to me, even if it's frustrating and expensive.

Clearing the order book is the only choice IF they choose to open trading when the site comes back up.

* They will provide their users at least one day to modify open orders.
* They will start the matching engine at a predetermined time that they have publicized to all of their users via email and on their site.

Good questions. 
The word "dilution," normally applies to the issuance of additional stock in a company, which has the effect of decreasing the value of individual shares already held by investors. 
In this setting, the meaning is similar. We substitute "coin" for "stock", and  "customers" for "investors":
From Coinbase's perspective, bitcoin and related altcoins are functionally equivalent. I'm not saying there are not important differences in how litecoin works vs. bitcoin, only that Coinbase is not really interested in those differences. (The difference they care about, are name recognition and the trust of their customers.)
If Coinbase were to offer altcoins in addition to bitcoin, they do not believe this would result in a corresponding increase in their customers'  net holdings across their multiple types of coin. Nor do they believe that offering altcoins will significantly increase their customer base. (They are going after mainstream users, not the folks in this subreddit.) 
Therefore, if what Coinbase believes is true, then adding altcoins will have the effect of diluting their customers' holdings across all of the digital currencies they offer, whereas Coinbase prefers for the value of their customers holdings to increase.
In more tangible form, the argument goes like this:
* Coinbase assumes customer A will buy $X in coins, no matter which coins they offer.
* If Coinbase offers coin Q and coin R, then customer A will purchase $Y&lt;$X of Q and $Z&lt;$X of R. 
* Since less of each coin Q and R are being held by customers, there will be more supply available in both coins. 
* Increased supply decreases price.

wtf?  Regulating a currency exchange has NOTHING to do with bitcoin. Of course traditional brokers and exchanges, who hold deposits on behalf of customers, need to be regulated. Why is this so confusing to some people?
Once the bitcoin network has been scaled up, and side-chains are common-place, we'll start to see actual trading systems built on blockchain technology (which is currently a SETTLEMENT system). Then third-party exchanges like Bitstamp will no-longer be needed. Until then, please do not pretend that anyone with half a brain really believes that bitcoin exchanges should be unregulated.

What is compelling about bitcoin is that it eliminates the need for a certain class of regulation by enabling the exchange of ownership between two parties **without the need for a third party intermediary** for electronic transactions. Bitcoin does this by using math, which makes no sense to try to regulate.  That is my point. (Sorry if that was unclear.)
I think why people get confused, is they assume that, because bitcoin works this way for transfers of ownership of bitcoin, that a bitcoin exchange also works this way. Exchanges do not work this way. They are not built using the bitcoin protocol. 
Therefore, it will be great when the bitcoin network has been scaled up to a degree where it is feasible to actually use it for trading. For now, the 10-minutes (on average) it takes for miners to add a new block to the blockchain still beats the heck out of the financial industry's standard 3-day settlement cycle.

The question should not be "is deflationary bad?" but **"is bitcoin deflationary?"**. 
Clearly bitcoin is deflationary, at least in the long-term, if you assume that a limited supply always results in the currency becoming more valuable, regardless of circumstances.
This line of reasoning is unsound because bitcoin is not a traditional currency. The value of (what you can buy with) bitcoin changes according to both the amount in circulation **and** the demand for that real-estate on the blockchain (which is what bitcoin actually is).
Let's say, hypothetically, that an entire closed economy operates using only bitcoin. And let's say there is an economic slow-down. What happens to the price of bitcoin, if no more currency is being created?
Perhaps this is only conjecture, but I'm pretty sure that the decrease in transaction volume (bitcoin changing hands) that would accompany an economic down-turn, will cause a devaluation of the bitcoin currency. In other words, the demand for real-estate on the blockchain  goes down along with a bitcoin economy that is sagging. (Think of the value of real-estate as a neighborhood goes into decline.)
As the value of bitcoin goes down, this has an inflationary effect which economists like, because it incentivizes people and businesses to spend, rather than save, which in turn stimulates economic growth.
Seems to me the whole argument for deflation is being made by basing  predictions of the future on misguided (even if deductively deduced) assumptions from past data. To get a flavor of how and why economists and other statisticians can easily fall into this kind of trap, see: [Black Swans and the Domains of Statistics](

Absolutely. I may be bullish on BTC but I see no reason to down-vote you.
Until BTC stabilizes (which may take a while), anyone who uses it is going to incur some degree of inconvenience, cost and/or risk (of holding). Therefore, regulated government fiat transfer services will still be a able charge a significant fee. 
Anyway, the end-game for bitcoin is not going head-to-head with gov't fiat, it's machine-to-machine transfers of ownership, which is what the protocol does.  The true value and stability of bitcoin will eventually stem from that, not its use as a currency by people like us.

It's deflationary if the value of a bitcoin increases steadily. For traditional currencies, inflation (opposite of deflation) is normally, and intentionally, accomplished by printing more money. If inflation gets out of control, the money supply is reduced. 
With bitcoin, the money supply can't be controlled by any central authority and there is a finite limit to how much can ever be created. Bitcoin, however, is fundamentally different from other currencies (see my earlier post).

Agree (sort of). Having a maximum blocksize at all, is about keeping things on a level playing field for everyone. It's an ideal Satoshi fought for, but it's also one that's impossible to keep to a high degree, whether or not we try to scale the network. 
The bottom line is that no one can successfully mine bitcoins on their PC at home anymore. Therefore, the current blocksize limitation serves no purpose.

Agreed, it's a great article, BUT... why do [Wall Street]( [Bill Gates]( and [others]( keep talking about "superior" forms of digital currency? 


The bottom line, which needs to be articulated in articles like this, is that only one source of digital scarcity is needed, and bitcoin is it.
Bitcoin is a **proven form of digital scarcity**. It was not the first attempt at a digital currency, nor will it be the last iteration, but it was the first to be proven to work. And as such, it will always have longest history, earning it the greatest trust (reputation by association is irrelevant. sorry not going there). And, because side-chains enable preservation of dgital scarcity without impeding new develpment, it is impractical for any new digital currency to replace bitcoin.
Not even ruthless traders, playing the [short squeeze]( can kill it.

Whatever the specifics of this announcement, it comes with the [backing of the NYSE, USAA and BBVA]( all of them huge financial institutions who command the public's trust, and who will neither tie their names to pump-and-dump schemes, nor take risks based on new or unproven technologies. 
Coinbase is looking to signal to rest of the world that bitcoin is for real by engineering a coordinated effort supported by major players in the financial sector. It is not an accident that they waited until the end of the 2013-14 speculative bubble to do this. 
I would take them seriously.

Does this book say anything new? 
A quick read through the bits on Amazon did not suggest anything more than yet another rehash of the technology, history and the potential. 
I'd prefer if authors would put more of their imaginative talents toward new use cases and how these might play out in the near and long term. 
Also, why is there no obvious option to buy this with BTC? Has anyone come across a away to pay for this book with bitcoin? (Gyft is all well-and-good, but it's just a work-around)

Notwithstanding [Bitstamp's]( recent [break-in]( they run a decent shop and it's very easy to trade there using limit, market and stop orders. (b.t.w. Always use limit orders. Anything else is trading on emotion.)

Do you code for a bank, hedge fund, or other financial institution that manages a significant amount of money? 
I do.
You're underestimating the importance and difficulty of security, authentication and record-keeping. What's most important is for Bitstamp to get back up safely, without further incident, and to make good on all customer deposits. If it takes them a few more days to do that properly, they should absolutely take their time.
What aggravates me is that everyone knows the risks of a hack to be high, no matter how tight their security is. There should be a crystal clear (disaster recovery) plan in place, with specific targets, where customers can follow their progress on-line. 
The fact that Nejc said "fully rebuilding our systems from the ground up" and keeps saying that they're still testing, implies that they did not have an adequate recovery plan outlined and tested ahead of time.

Tracking asset ownership on [the blockchain]( *is* a big deal:
Thinking of bitcoin itself as an asset (whether a commodity, currency, option or some derivative of these) is putting the cart before the horse (IMHO). Once ownership of assets, like stocks, can be legally tracked on the blockchain (meaning [bitcoin's blockchain]( not one run by a group of [banks and securities firms]( the door is open to many more upstream applications. 
First replace the centralized settlement companies (e.g. DTCC), then the centralized exchanges (e.g. NYSE), then the brokers (e.g. JP Morgan), then the banks (e.g. Capital One). In the securities industry, we call this the "sell-side". These are the companies that make massive amounts of money because they own the keys to specific aspects of how assets (including dollars) are moved around. 
Each financial company wants to save money by not having to pay another company for a service they depend on, and the blockchain is the way to do this (and also why [banks want to use their own blockchain]( to protect themselves from being replaced as well). Settlement companies like DTCC are the first to be targeted because they are an annoying monopoly (I have dealt with some their departments first hand) and they sit the bottom of the sell-side food chain.  
Ultimately the "buy-side" (investors, pension funds, hedge funds etc.) will look to lower their cost of doing business by replacing all sell-side functionality with blockchain-based technologies. But once this happens, hedge funds and others will have essentially lowered the barriers to entry (e.g. "pay to play") allowing everyone access via open source APIs (e.g. distributed peer-to-peer trading), no high fee [Ameritrade account]( required for the rest of us.
PS I don't know where this will end up, but it is disruption on a massive scale, and there are no guarantees the world will be a better place for it. Imagining and building what comes next... well I hope some here are working hard on that.

Blythe Masters's [Digital Asset Holdings]( (DAH) and [R3]( are the financial services sector's  (i.e. bank's) response to bitcoin, which goes something like: "great technology, the big boys will handle it from here."
With this perspective in mind, it is deeply curious that others in finance see DAH and R3 in a light that is not all that dissimilar from how the bitcoin literate see it. In this Bloomberg article, Matt Levine says: "If your settlement process, for legal or customary or whatever reasons, requires lots of manual intervention from multiple parties, then just looking into a mirror and saying "blockchain!" three times won't solve that."
What Matt means, probably without realizing it, is precisely what is obvious to probably anyone reading this: that a private blockchain is just another type of a database. What does it mean for a company to secure it's own data with a proof-of-work algorithm? 
On that, I have to agree with Matt: Not much.
The R3 Consortium takes blockchain tech a small step further by focusing on settlement across [45 banks]( (at present count). Which is definitely an improvement over [SWIFT] ( but it hardly leverages the real potential of a blockchain. 
...because the value of a blockchain grows exponentially with participation. It's not the size of the participants in a blockchain, it's how many that really counts.
This is a message that is only now, and very faintly, starting to become clear to the non-bitcoin world. I believe that commentary such as Matt Levine's, is the sort we should be paying attention to.

Of course there are secretive meetings about what can be done with the protocol. That does not affect the protocol, which is still open... and still decentralized. 
There is only one thing that an individual, or group of colluding, large stakeholders can do to bitcoin: They can manipulate the price by saturating the market.
Let's see... fixed supply + large stakeholders dumping on the market... so that means their holdings are diminishing over time... hmm...

Ok, but but real damage to what? Bitcoin price? Mistrust by the general public?
The situation with respect to these two factors is arguably bad already, but that's having little or no effect on funding for bitcoin start-ups, interest from politicians who are not happy with the banking industry, or the generation of ideas for new use-cases of bitcoin and blockchain technology.
The cat's out of the bag with respect to building on top of the bitcoin blockchain. I think that all we are talking about here, really, is how long it will take for the bitcoin price to stabilize to make it usable as currency.  (The introduction of derivatives by Wall Street firms certainly looks promising as way to manage, and probably lessen, price volatility, but that's not something I'd be willing to put a specific time frame on.)

Not following you... What are these people centralizing, exactly? I don't see how it matters if they meet in secret and whisper to each other. What can they do? Convince everyone to do things their way because they're rich? Do you value rich people's opinions over others?
What keeps bitcoin from actually being taken over and centralized, is the active involvement of people who review and contribute to the Open Source code base, and the involvement of disparate parties (individuals, companies, governments) in the operation of the distributed network (miners, full nodes, merchants etc.).
