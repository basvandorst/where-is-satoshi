It's not though. The reality is everyone wants to make money on crypto, but have zero knowledge of what it is, how it came around or what it will be used for. 
The true future of Bitcoin will be very very different to the conversations we are having with people atm, right now the main questions I get are how much money do you think I'll be able to make on X coin.

Honestly though, what do you expect.
Affordable housing was designed to provide comfortable living to the masses. In actuality, a bunch of already rich people bought them and inflated the rent to make more profit, while using the asset to increase their portfolio size. 
Tax reliefs designed to help poorer people save money have been exploited by the rich for profit and minimal tax payment. 
Wherever there is an opportunity to make money, people will do it. The saving grace of Bitcoin is the fact it is still somewhat complicated to the lay person and therefore we've only seen a small influx of people.
The technology will continue for the purists, however we'll see more and more people playing the market the easier it is to access.

But you seem to be basing this off one visit to the cafe, am I wrong in thinking that? There's others in this thread who have said they've used the service and there was no issues taking Bitcoin. There's also a bunch of stories online of people using it - staff were trained fine and willing to help.
I feel you have some weird hostility towards the cafe/owner, but from what I saw yesterday it seemed like the way they are advertising the ability to use Bitcoins, is exactly what people want to happen on here

It was a bit busy today and there was only one girl working so I didn't try pushing to pay with bitcoins, so can't comment on what you've said either way. However, I have read a couple of cool articles by the guy who owns it, who wants to push Bitcoin and the idea behind it. From what I've read, he's not jumping on the bandwagon, but rather believes in the movement

Thank you!

I've been a longtime lurker here waiting for the chance to get involved and bought .25 of a coin today - intending on buying the other .75 at the end of the month, depending on how the market continues to behave.
I think (selfishly) that it's dropped again to a low price. It gives people like myself an opportunity to get involved without having to spend a huge sum of money. 
I also live in a city where you can use bitcoins in some stores and cafe's, so will take advantage of that and actually use the currency for something more than a get rich quick scheme (unless it jumps to $1m a coin tomorrow, then I'm selling as fast as I got in!)

I'm curious about this - Does this not leave you in a state of limbo when it comes down to managing your money?
For example, you may get paid the 1 bitcoint one week which is worth $1000, then the next week the market collapses and your bitcoin is now worth $200; therefore the money you use to live has been cut by 5.
I'm just interested in how you manage your entire salary fluctuating so much from month to month

Brilliant - Totally makes sense. 
I wish more people understood the important Bitcoin could play in this role. I have only recently gotten into Bitcoins, but have been lurking for a while. I found it difficult to "get" to start with, but things like this are simple for anyone to understand.
There's a lot of buzz words and people who understand it, but not so much for people out there who are passing by and want a quick understanding
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:21:25
I think it's more a personal thing. I've read about them for so long and I'm not particularly wealthy, so investing little bits at a time until I get to a certain goal seems sensible. 
I imagine at that point I'll continue to buy them, but I want a tangible goal first 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:16:31
Yeah I guess if you're just going to cash it out each week, it seems kind of pointless though. 
I'm struggling to understand why you'd do it that way I suppose. What is it that has made you decide to get paid directly in Bitcoins? Especially right now with the fluctuations in the market being so dramatic and so frequent
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:36:37
I think if you truly want to see Bitcoin become adopted by the masses, this kind of influence is absolutely vital.
I've spent months lurking here and only started posting last week after I bought part of a coin. I have seen a mix of sarcasm, none tolerance for those who don't understand how decentralised currency works and a rhetoric from some that it's a secret that those in the know are hiding.
There is some incredibly helpful people though, who are on hand to help the evolution and progress of Bitcoin, however big investment by things like the NYSE can only help in the whole idea becoming more serious and more widely adopted.
Personally, I will be happy for images like that to be in the past, with a move towards marketing to the wider public, who don't see the humor in a paint image.
I don't by any means mean to shit on it, I just think those who seriously want to see progress and acceptance, understand it's time to move past this stage in Bitcoins history

I think he's right in some respects when he discusses the issue with sending the money to the wrong person and having a tough time getting it back - from a general consumer perspective this isn't a great system and would put people off (although i'm sure this is an issue which can be resolved).

"Britain could be the richest country in the World by 2030:
Interesting, what's the source? 
"Daily Mail"....
Haha oh okay, very good. They've stopped blaming blacks for the recession and Muslims for all the problems in Britain and come out with this instead.
It's absolute garbage of a newspaper

It seems the fluctuations in prices gives the opportunity for new Bitcoin purchaser's to get involved in the action. It also seems to be one of the only successful ways to attract interest and attention to the idea of Bitcoin, aside from those who are already aware of cryptocurrency 
What do you foresee happening to make this interests more widestream and to attract as many new people to the idea of Bitcoin, so it can become a more widely used currency?

It is what it is, they will sensationalise what they don't understand, as it's easy to get readers/viewers.
I watched a podcast about a guy who'd "studied the deepweb" and was talking about his experiences - 99% of which was available on the "surface" web and just sensationalised bullshit.
For every gun bought with bitcoins, there'll be 1000 more bought by Governments. How about bringing that point up, instead of shitting on new technology.

It'll also tie in nicely with the GDPR and companies avoiding holding too much personal data. Gonna have to look into this more as there's definitely something to offer here

Does this allow vendors to circumnavigate pci compliance?

Seems fairly elaborate when they could have more success just buying a gold company and taking over the market that way. 
Gold really isn't the commodity it was anymore either - in terms of actual trade value, it isn't really used anymore. If the banks were to collapse, gold really wouldn't be a top priority - skills, water, food etc. would be way more desired 
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:35:04
But didn't Neil deGrass Tyson explain that actually mining it and transporting it back to earth would make it completely pointless - they wouldn't be able to get large enough amounts back to earth and if they somehow did, they'd flood the market with gold and reduce the price further

I don't understand what's going on 
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:27:51
Because it's totally contrasting the original premise of a virtual currency. As soon as it becomes tangible and an actual physical currency, it is susceptible to the same corruption, tax laws, inflation rates etc that are the fundamental issues those who support the Bitcoin movement have.
I have an extremely rudimentary understanding of Bitcoin, I just see this being something that the originals may see as a step towards normality, when this concept was meant to be revolutionary and different.
@_date: 2013-07-22 17:16:48
You're being down voted, but I thought the same thing. I thought the idea of Bitcoin was to prevent it being something tangible. The idea of it being virtual money allows it to avoid tax laws etc. By creating something like this, does it not just start the process to it becoming an actual currency?
@_date: 2013-07-22 19:28:40
There's literally no need for such an arsey response, that kind of attitude straight away puts people off reading about it or learning the benefits. You could have easily stated your point without the arsey undertone it carried.
I readily admit I have a rudimentary understanding of Bitcoin and with that I don't think I fully articulated the concerns I would have if I was a major player in the Bitcoin movement.
I personally believe that by creating a central focus point like this, you are already starting to make this virtual system more concrete and tangiable. As soon as the complexity that Bitcoin carries in a legal sense begins to break away, it makes it easier for governments and law makes to regulate it, like any other currency. By creating this embassy, to me you are trying to normalise it, instead of just educating the masses and making it a virtual enterprise, where it is harder to govern by those who would want to manipulate if for their personal gains. 
At the end of the day, this is just my opinion, I just don't see what positives you are getting from making an embassy, apart from the sentimental feeling that you are progressing with your project because it now has a physical home to sit in.
