Yes. I agree 100%. 
Hopefully people see that 1) exchanges involved were NOT major SK exchanges (that would be Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit), 2) this didn’t happen to an exchange with a clean history, and lastly, 3) one needs to do some research when choosing exchanges to use. (And a personal addition would be: to take S Korean Govt’s announcement re:crypto with a grain of salt).

Yes.... Yapizon... Youbit... what embarassing names �� and embrassing security (if true) to match.

Haha I totally agree. The current S Korean govt has actaully disappointed a lot of people in their 20’s and 30’s—also their biggest (past) supporters—due to their handling of the situation with crypto.
I know a lot of people internationally are interested in the situation in Korea right now. So I was sharing the news + adding my 2 cents (~250 satoshis?) about the situation. I personally have a hard time believing it really was N Korea... but who knows.

Naver is Korea’s Google. No need to click on the link tho! I’m sure you can search google yourself  and find something. Just sharing :)

Honestly I was a bit surprised by the timing of the news (with the Winter Olympics coming up and all). It’s like one hot potato plus two. Kinda interested to see if NK will respond about this at all.

Ooooooh and and South Korea’s current president = President MOON. ������
