Any reasons why this won't become the next silk road? AFAIK you can simply need to set up a node *somewhere* in the world in order to sell goods for bitcoin more or less anonymously.
Looks good though!

Nice work, guys!

Frankly, if there is any chance of prosecuting this guy, you should do so. If he takes you up on your offer, the only thing that will happen is him being more careful when hacking other victims. This is a golden chance of preventing him from attacking people LONG-term, even if it means a lot of work for you.

Here are two explanations that I feel are the strongest reasons for merchants not to adopt bitcoin:
It is much more common for customers to pay by (almost) free SEPA wire transfers and direct debit systems, while credit cards are used way less than in the US. Therefore the incentive for merchants to cut off transaction fees is not at as strong and don't outweigh the unawareness and uncertain risk of adopting Bitcoin.
Another explanation is that the start-up scene is way bigger and much better funded in the US than it is in Europe. Especially in the digital tech area, development seems therefore to happen at a different pace.

After shorting credit card fees to a minimum, where is the incentive for EU merchants to jump on the bitcoin train?

I feel like Andreas Antonopoulos is missing in this list. He's  THE bitcoin ambassador.

If they fake funds were used to trade for bitcoins, I would assume that the traded bitcoins were then have been withdrawn. Either to store them outside of the MtGox ecosphere or to trade them for FIAT money on other exchanges.

Hey guys,
can you tell us a little bit about what makes your exchange more trustworthy than other exchanges?

How can Europeans trade on OKCoin? Are you planning to support SEPA Wires?

Unfortunately this article fails to explain how exactly they want to decrease the confirmation time. Did I miss something? Any ideas?

Well not really, even if they accept Bitcoin, they will still have to accept credit cards.

In case NASDAQ and other stock exchanges would really start using the blockchain as a public ledger for stock certificates, wouldn't the market run out of bitcoins that can be used as colored coins after a few years? Even with 8 decimals, it seems like the number of bitcoins is quite limited for data storage. 
I understand this would be great for the BTC-exchange rate, but the limited supply of bitcoins seems fatal for applications such as smart contracts, stock certificates etc.

Will there be any additional fees involved due to Kraken's service?
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:28:03
Looks great! What is the catch of using Kraken instead of claiming funds directly at MtGox??
