USD continues to flow into the Gox system because many buyers are unaware of alternatives; this is plausible. So correct me if I'm wrong but at this point one of two things must happen:
1) USD withdrawals get fixed and arbiters lower the spread.
2) Withdrawals remain defunct and confidence in MtGox further erodes. Traders are willing to sell their "Gox bucks" for fewer and fewer bitcoins and create a larger spread.

Pulled from my ass: All those selling at &lt;$70 will be kicking themselves in a few weeks.

What I really do: Watch Mt. Gox all day.

I'm not sure I buy this as the entire explanation. Rate increases and decreases correlate among the exchanges fairly closely yet the gap has remained. Who would purchase bitcoins on MtGox when they could get them so much cheaper elsewhere?

My experience with LocalTill has been positive. Money appeared in less than an hour.

Yes you are right, I was just poking fun at a certain prominent Bitcoin advocate's favorite expression.

I was looking at this and my biggest concern is whether the distributed keys would be kept secure by next of kin. They might stick their key in a desk drawer or something. Maybe buy them all safes?

Thats great, now how about those Singles?

I just had this same issue with vanitygen - it generated an invalid key. Checked it three times, no good.

I was thinking 3 out of 5, evil twin brother finds sister`s unsecured key, only needs one more key to steal the money without a trace. Do safety deposit boxes pass to a beneficiary?

Is there a way to add transactions in bulk or does each one have to be entered manually?

1. Announce plans to develop some sort of quantum ASIC rigs.
2. Take preorders on said rigs.
3. Profit!

The risk that your computer will catch on fire is quite small. What kind of risk are you referring to?

$1200 for an empty DX large case? Seems pricey.
