Care to help by listing other potential places?

Thanks for the public confirmation it isn't your site.
Great work on revealing your advertisement partner and what not.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:49:34
Reading, reading, reading. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:32:00
Thanks for the honest response!

Thanks for the public confirmation it isn't your site.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:45:40
Yes, like  a real news site.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:42:21
No offense taken. I didn't see it as coming off as a dick either. I try not to read in to things much.
I know this IS a touchy subject but it really bugs me when some site is still likely promoting this stuff and he and they refuse to reveal they are owned by GAW. People should be really upset about this.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:46:03
Is he? Show me someone connected in bitcoin who has talked to him.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:49:20
Thanks for the confirmation publicly!
Also, great policy.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:29:51
Exactly. If and when it is safe, I'll reveal who I am. I am not involved in a cryptocurrency news site but a mainstream one and even I fear the potential loss of my job from this situation and a potential lawsuit.

Thank you for the honest explanation.

Sigh, I work at Venture Beat. Garza claims we interviewed him but if that is the case it is NOT on the editorial calendar. Perhaps someone on staff interviewed him but they clearly never had ANY intention of running it since it doesn't appear in our editorial calendar.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:41:00
It seems they are honest. You are right, I wasn't sure originally but they have really proven themselves.
Do you have any link regarding the CCN / media blitz stuff? I will start searching Google.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:46:09
Not really though.

Please explain why a shaddowbanned user is still allowed to make submissions here that we can all see? Who is intervening for them?
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:36:11
So, here is the issue...
The user we are discussing is banned by reddit admins and algorithms. Yet his posts are CONSTANTLY on HOT tab. Meaning that one of you moderators understands that he was shadowbanned by reddit and is STILL approving his posts.
So, someone added him to automoderator whitelist. Care to explain why? Who is to say that they weren't paid? Does it seem strange to you that someone who is clearly shadow banned is still able to make posts often?
Does it not seem strange that this one particular account is shaddow banned and yet still making posts? Something about this is super fishy.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:34:58
This is EXACTLY the issue. How can ANYONE trust someone who is using deception via the press?
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:26:35
Thanks for the public confirmation it isn't your site.
The fact he refuses to name which site it is and is potentially using it to pump his coins and operations says illegitimate. How can you trust anyone that would abuse the trust of readers like this?
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:45:26
I highly doubt someone at these organizations is going to risk themselves to give some nobody shithead these documents.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:30:37
He clearly said they pay the bills in crypto. It seems to me that he gets tips from readers and just uses those coins.
Being a believer also doesn't mean they actually use it either.
Based on what I have read and looking at the BTC addresses on the Coin Fire site it seems like they immediately take the coins from tips and dump them at a few different addresses.
@_date: 2014-12-22 14:33:39
Valid point.

Stan, do you have evidence it is Cloud Miner News?
I won't use my real name as I don't want to get sued for just asking questions. Yes, that is a real fear. I am familiar with several people who are engaged in legal battles with Josh right now and I don't want to be one of those people.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:37:04
I hope everyone is archiving as it seems they are. Don't use archive.org though as they can remove anything and everything under legal threat and have been known to do so.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:59:55
Thanks for the confirmation and transparency!
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:47:54
Wow. Just wow. People believed this?
I work for one of those outlets. I am sending this up the chain to find out if it is true. I highly doubt it is as I would have seen it on our editorial calendar system after a quick search just now... I don't see anything with his name on it.
