"US" doesn't have rights.  People have rights.  If the SEC spent half the time they did bringing down 1broker on the gold / silver / BTC futures.....  
The only ones being violated are people by governments.

When you post things about Fractional Reserve Banking - you must expect massive troll brigade.  Just like when you post about NOT paying taxes - they must look big when they are small.

Car Makers Create Cars
Bakers Create Bread
Bankers Create Money
Seriously, what planet do you live on where banks follow laws and don't buy out the regulators?  Where banks feel the "wrath" and "huge legal issues"?  Have you been paying attention the last 8 years?
If there were no banks, there would be no Federal Reserve Note.  Banks CREATE money.  Get over it.
If banks didn't create money, and just loan out other people's money - they wouldn't be in business.  How many "paycheck advance" stores stay in business?  That's the bankers schtick - they create money.  No worries about not getting paid back.
"between the deposit"  = I deposit $1.00 - they lend out $0.70, and it's placed on their "assets" balance sheet.  I can still withdraw my dollar without a bank run.  That $.70 was created, and placed in their assets.  Where else would it come from?  poof!

Banker Shills are poo pooing this idea - because it's the BEST Weapon EVER.
Sign up for CC - Lie - Get Approved - Buy Bitcoin - Never give them their dollar back in trade.  If they want more dollars - they can effin' print 'em.

Perhaps you have never heard of "Fractional Reserve Banking".  You should youtube it and spend an hour or so learning how the banks create money to "loan" to you.  The only thing is - it's not a Loan.  They didn't have it in the first place.  They CREATED it, with no repercussions if they don't get it back - they just CREATE more.
Moneychangers also change meaning of words like "loan" - to make you think when you get a "loan" from a bank - it's like getting a Loan from your friend.  The difference?  Your friend had to earn it.  Banks CREATE it without any labor.
So - if your belief is that theft is taking place when you don't pay back a "loan" to a bank.  You MUST ignore the theft that took place when you took out the "loan" from the bank.  Simply put - not paying back a bank "loan" is conning the con.

That money loaned out, between the deposit - where does that come from?  poof!  Ta-Da - the magic of fractional reserve banking.  And what of that loaned out dollar that makes it back into the banking system?  The system is so over leveraged it has no choice but keep printing.
You say banks "can't" like there is some physical barrier between a banks' ability to type a few digits into a computer.  I'm sure we can trust them.  Haven't seen a run on banks for decades - I wonder why that is...

Bitcoin much?  I really couldn't care less about their stupid paper or how they score me.  The time to attack may be at hand to end the moneychangers stranglehold on humanity.

The mind stretches to reach that conclusion, and only upon ignoring the fact the banks didn't have the money they loaned you - THEY CREATED IT.  There is theft going on alright... let's put an end to it.

The Federal Reserve is no more Federal than Federal Express.  It's a private bank owned by private shareholders who earn 6% on every single dollar in existence.  The best video to explain this is Mike Maloney "hidden Secrets of money" 
The only "governmental constitutional" money is gold or silver coin (US Constitution Article I Section x)
"...Nothing but gold and silver coin..."  It even calls out paper money or "note" as illegal tender.
"If the American people ever allow a private bank to issue its' currency.  First by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that grow up around their children will deprive them of all liberty until they are homeless in the land their forefathers conquered.... I believe banks are more a threat the the american liberty then a standing army" - Thomas Jefferson.

This is propaganda; a hit piece on cryptocurrency hodlers.  Don't fall for this crap.  The real story can be found in this simple video.
