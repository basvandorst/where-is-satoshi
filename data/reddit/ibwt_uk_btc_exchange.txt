Get the customer to file a police report, and get your company to file a police report (referencing each other), and let him do the transaction. Make sure you get a reference of his police report. Then leave it to the police.
You would have done your due diligence (reporting it), and it's not your responsibility to trace the culprit.
edit: this should not be taken as 'legal advice', just a suggestion.

This is why most exchanges are now adopting the 'full verification' method. Otherwise they'll be knocked flat and left running to catch up in due time (when it gets bigger and regulations start to kick in).

And if/when btc value rises exponentially (say, if the US Federal Gov shutdown and disbanded and US banks stopped accepting international bank requests, and then the Federal Reserve shutdown).. like.. that would never happen anytime soon though .. 
then every miner will be a HAPPY miner (admittedly, some happier than others)
Cheap plug time -

Aye, IBWT uses the Faster Payments system also, in and out in 1 day.
Blatant plug -

no, they only have 26,000.
600,000 was in commission, but then you gotta think of expenses (he had staff, which were very well paid apparently), and that in 2011, you would need a lot more bitcoin to purchase someone of equal value today. And though he made a terrible mistakes that got him caught, he must've invested some, and definitely spent some.
So substantially more btc went through SR in previous years, though very probably much less quantity of actual purchases.

Very odd, must say I'm very curious as to their reasons, and why they're not being more specific.
Blatant plug - If you're from the UK -  (UK exchange)
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:22:36
And I thought I was bad :o
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:53:43
Not that keen on gambling, but good luck.

Viva la Bitcoin!

If you use your personal account for day trading you will very likely run into trouble. I strongly suggest to clear it with your bank if that is your intention. Or get an alternative bank account which you bank has agreed can be used for the purposes you wish.
If you're just 'buying' bitcoins (via an individual or an exchange), then you're fine, and the onus of responsibility falls on the exchange/seller (do your research on sellers before you buy!).
Blatant plug - if you're buying in the UK -

A UK exchange.
@_date: 2013-10-12 21:20:51
depends what currency you want to change it to?
@_date: 2013-10-05 10:01:06
Nice to know, not really a 'thing' in the UK
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:14:46
aww diddums
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:02:09
Its a valid point.
@_date: 2013-10-15 11:26:32
-Personal Mining equipment.
-Shares/invest in a bitcoin company (do lots of research!).
-Buy some bitcoins to 'save'.
-Buy some bitcoins to spend! (most important).
-Maybe think about starting your own bitcoin business (if you're so inclined).
hmm, thats all I can think of offhand. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:05:51
if you could figure out a way so that people couldn't purposefully throw matches (LoL) .. sounds interesting
@_date: 2013-10-13 10:14:51
I find its mostly there to protect exchanges from the large amount of scammers and fraudsters out there.
blatant plug - 
UK Btc exchange, no transfer fees, no exchange rates.
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:07:52
Luckily for people with a UK bank account there is - IBWT -  (currently UK residents only, soon to open for global customers, with a UK bank account) - Yes this was a blatant plug, but with a damn good opportunity to do it!
@_date: 2013-10-15 15:48:59
Quantum wouldn't work with the way the protocol works.

You Sir win a gold star :D
@_date: 2013-10-12 21:15:03
This is why IBWT uses enforced 2fa
@_date: 2013-10-09 22:30:08
Already happened.
@_date: 2013-10-10 09:40:38
well said.
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:18:11
things would've cost a lot more bitcoins in 2011 than recently, so a lot of that 'commission' is distorted.
@_date: 2013-10-25 09:39:43
What this person said :)
@_date: 2013-10-05 09:50:47
The original definition of "Terrorism" was defined as a Nation State conducting actions of terror against its own people .. somehow the original definition has been twisted along the way .. I wonder why that is ..
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:52:07
A fair bit of money, also consider viable alt coins, what about LTC holders (assuming it grows like Bitcoin) and other viable alt coins that are yet to exist.
@_date: 2013-10-09 11:03:39
the Swedish/Nordic countries bank cards are pretty cool, in that they give a lot of info and photo. But its not common outside the Nordic countries for a bank card to be like that.
Also, remember, banks are private companies (mostly), and having ID issued by a private company is different than having it issued by the respective Government.
