No I think he just didn't want too much political pressure on such a young project back then..

I got the drift... 
Reddit kept telling me 'something went wrong' while I tried to post not knowing it was being plastered over the place nonetheless..

SOMETIMES THE NIGERIAN PRINCE IS AN OLD WHITE MAN. E.g Michael Neu, 67 from Slidell. Google him

May I ask why?

Remitano.com, luno, paxful.com etc are all few of many Bitcoin exchanges currently in the Nigerian Crypto market trading Bitcoin and Eth 24/7 nonstop! Don't let some idiots tell you sht. 
There are hardworking Nigerian youths who don't scam and have bn Hodln btc prob longer than ya'll. I'm a young Nigerian, I live in Nigeria, got into btc long time ago, trained as a Pilot in Florida partly with my btc savings.  Even though that dug a big hole in my wallet, I can't complain. 
Things are hard in Nigeria no doubt coupled with a moronic president and useless politicians everywhere you look but all of us don't resort to scams to survive. Reading all these negativities all the time hurts but just know we all are not scammers and most of us work harder than most of ya'll do! 
Satoshi Nakamoto might even be Nigerian for all I care.. LOL! 
Your money your choice but just know there are real people who need and will appreciate your BTC gift/knowledge better than a repentant probably uneducated fraudstar!

You are legendary! Can't stop laughing ����

I understand that but I  see it beyond this scope. If you truly understand and believe in Bitcoin, the blockchain tech and the problems it was created to solve,  you wouldn't think about it this way and you will know that the 40k they projected is prob nothing compared to the future potential of Bitcoin.  Let your journey in the Bitcoin space be a matter of personal conviction not what another  individual has to say.
