Investing in a well-diversified portfolio is far from gambling. Though investing 95% of your retirement funds into bitcoin arguably is..


After the GFC, super funds made major gains as markets recovered. The super balances of people who are still working today are largely unaffected. The people who were most affected were those that retired during the GFC and needed access to the funds at a relatively bad time.


"Expected"... there is no such consensus, it is speculation.
And just some minor nitpicks that are not really important, but may be useful to know...


Actually it's currently 9.25%. It is set to slowly rise to 12% by 2019, maybe even later than that because the new government wants to delay it.


The current government has only just announced that it wants to raise the age you can apply for the government provided pension to 70 by 2035 (it still has to go through Parliament).
This is not the same as the age you are allowed to access your super. For example, currently the age you can receive a pension is 65, however you can start accessing your super at 55.
