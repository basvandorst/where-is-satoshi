Why doesn't Intel hoard those chips and use all that money to fund a mining operation in the place with cheapest electricity and make bank, or any company with the resources and capital to acquire the best hardware in large volume and organize such a mining operation for that matter?

I had a backup file for this android app "Bitcoin Wallet" and decoded and decrypted it or something. Used the bitcoinj github package's ./wallet-tool to 'dump' it to a text file. I found the WIF key in there and that's what I tried on BTC.com. That backup file was originally created in early 2016, but I backed it up again on Aug. 16 and the address I used to check was what the wallet says now. This is the file I decrypted. There were coins in the wallet prior to the fork though, which should have become BCC, no?
Like I said I don't fully grasp it all. I wish I had been as interested in bitcoin when I bought my first ones as I'm becoming to be now haha.
And for what it's worth, I looked up the Mycelium address I sent all the coins too before I attempted the decryption on the blockchain and it shows no balance and no transactions but both wallets on my phone show multiple confirmations.

Yes, there are two addresses and two WIF keys in the text file I ended up with. 
My understanding was that it shouldn't matter which one I use. Please correct me if I'm wrong, and yes I spend more time pouring over forums than I'd like.

Thanks I should have thought about that

I am a pretty inexperienced self-taught programmer. I am not sure what's confusing you, though. The android app creates a backup (a protobuf wallet, actually), which I decrypted and decoded (using bitcoinj's ./wallet-tool from a linux terminal) to obtain a text file. Within this text file, I saw "WIF=xxxx" which is what I attempted to use on BTC.com.  Prior to sending all my coins to Mycelium, if I had restored this backup in the app there would be coins on it, some of which had been placed there prior to the fork (and should have become BCH after the fork, as I understand it).
You make it seem like there is a single 'correct address' while as I understand it my wallet has multiple sending addresses and I should be able to look it up on the blockchain with any of those. It's not enough money for me to really care about, but I am just trying to understand the fork itself better.

Yea nothing there. Just confuses me since I still had BTC from the first purchase I made on that wallet before transferring to mycelium, so you'd think I should still have BCC right?
Is it possible they got sent to mycelium?? Or if I've spent coins since the fork could I have been spending BCC along with BTC?

Anything from Jaxx?

Where should I put my coins if I want to get both once the fork happens?
Will I get an equal amount of S2X like with the BCH fork? And do we know when exactly the fork is happening?

Yea I thought that as well, I have another older backup but nothing there either but I thought that. I think you're right, not sure what else I can do besides restore my Android wallet back to that backup, and then see if the address changes. Maybe I did some kind of dumb backwards transfer I forgot about.

I know that if I sweep the paper wallet later on and send some to a new wallet that I should send the remaining coins to a new secure paper wallet, but is it OK to keep sending coins to the same paper wallet if I continue to acquire them?

Yea I hadn't thought of it that way. Already have a few Linux sticks around too. Thanks.

Can you give a brief context of what nSequence represents
