Storj dev here. It's fair to be skeptical, but I appreciate you doing it in a way that educates folks about potential concerns without resorting to FUD. These are all things we're thinking about as we test and grow the project. We can say what we want, but at the end of the day most folks will only ultimately be won over when it's been stable, poked, tested and demonstrated economic viability.
Edit: Many questions can probably be answered by checking out our draft whitepaper: 
There's a new version forthcoming that goes more in-depth about attack vectors and reputation systems.

Hey, the more good criticism the better.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:24:22
Storj dev here. Just to clarify: the SJCX used is a Counterparty token so technically it sits atop the Bitcoin blockchain. The token itself doesn't have its own blockchain (though we will likely use Factom for metadata storage). 
Also, haven't played with this before, but you can also check out [CoinLock]( Not sure about the infrastructure but it looks like it lets you sell content for Bitcoin.
I also think there are some MMORPGs in the works that will use Bitcoin and other crypto for in-game economies, but they aren't prime time yet.

This is true, though it won't be "bitcoin-based" in the sense that MaidSafe does not use a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-18 23:40:13
Core dev here. Actually Maidsafe and Storj devs are talking, not competing. The more the entire decentralized ecosystem thrives, the better off we'll all be.
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:02:01
No worries. It's still the wild wild west out there so caution is warranted.
I do think comparisons to Bitcoin in that regard are unfair, since (in my opinion) nothing else like it existed at the time. It (blockchain tech) basically launched a new kind of ecosystem.
Different projects support themselves in different ways. Our community has been supportive and we strive for transparency and accountability (frequent updates on dev, etc.) and I think as long as our community and supporters are satisfied and have their concerns addressed our model can work too.

Hi BashCo. I understand your concerns. However, neither I, nor anyone on the dev team is violating any of the "Not OK" rules or performing any kind of voting manipulation.

Our token, SJCX, is a Counterparty asset which sits on top of Bitcoin. We wanted to use Bitcoin's blockchain for metadata storage but there wasn't enough room in a transaction. We've been thinking about sidechains for a while, but it still remains to be seen how and when they will be implemented and we don't want to sit on our hands until then. We are, however, talking with Factom now.

I have been working mostly on the front-end stuff (the Metadisk test clients), but I will say that, at this moment, we don't yet have implemented perfect solutions to these issues. responded in another thread:
I know these are challenges for other projects too. Part of the reason for the fundraising is to help find solutions to these issues and support the people working on them (devs, community, etc.). The forthcoming new whitepaper should answer all your questions more adequately. If you don't want to support a project until it completely satisfies those questions, that is fine, however I think it's important to support the entire decentralized ecosystem of projects (with people legitimately trying for solutions here).
The video describes what we are working towards, and we are working towards it. We're trying to balance ship-fix-ship-fix (getting things out to the public to test and play with) with waiting for the perfect solution.

Hey all, Storj dev here. This was not written by a Storj team member, but I'm sure the writer intended well. However, the article does appear to capitalize on a sudden fear to push our project (which I, of course, feel is awesome in its own right). I don't personally approve of that.
As I understand it, if there was a hack at all, it was basically that folks used weak passwords on multiple sites, the other sites got hacked and hackers tried the credentials against dropbox accounts which didn't have 2FA enabled. Then again, if what posted is true, the leaked credentials aren't even valid against Dropbox.
The real issue here (for any project/product/etc.) is that the weakest point in the security chain is often the user. I think Snowden himself even mentioned that. Any user of a service like Dropbox that offers 2FA should have it turned on, but many folks don't because they find it cumbersome.
@_date: 2014-07-19 19:32:00
The problem was people were asking similar questions in several different threads at once. Several people asking those questions were on IRC so I started the ball rolling and then jumped in. graciously posted the log above so people not on IRC can see.

I'll let respond for himself here, but I am also a co-founder of Storj (little j) and am in the process of developing a separate whitepaper regarding autonomous server-agents that is partially inspired by gmaxwell's post. The framework I'm developing will be generalizable (i.e. does not require the creation of a new altcoin), but we plan to ultimately apply it to Storj as well.
Jeff Garzik has offered to review my draft when it is ready (provided it is not "altcoin city" -- it won't be). I will also have it reviewed by colleagues in the artificial life/complexity science community as well.

We believe in cooperation, not competition and think that as the landscape of decentralized services evolve, cooperation will bring us all closer to the decentralized world we want.

An important difference between us and MaidSafe is that we work with blockchain technologies and they do not (as they got started before Satoshi released his paper, so they've been evolving down a different path). They're also trying to architect a new kind of decentralized internet, whereas (for now) we're more tightly focused on decentralized storage.

@_date: 2014-09-11 17:25:03
Another Storj dev here. Before I jump in, want to thank you for providing your criticism in a level-headed manner. It makes the conversations more educational for all.
I have to disagree here. There were many people who stored quite legal materials on this service who forever [lost access to their files as well](
In addition, Storj can (and already is, via our [current MetaDisk prototype]( used for file sharing. All you have to do is share both the hash and key for your file and anyone can download it (of course, if you don't want someone doing that, your key should not be shared).
There's also talk of building all kinds of decentralized services on top of Storj, such as decentralized video sharing, etc. once the network matures.
**Attack Vector**
I'll call your specific attack the "Honest Pinnochio Collusion" attack :) Basically, a centralized entity controls many nodes that do honestly store files, but that he can "pull the strings" on them all simultaneously at any time.
There may not be one single prevention method (possibly a combination of several), but here is a potential one:
A pseudo-reputation system can be implemented and the "reputation" of nodes could be recorded in an immutable fashion on a blockchain (e.g. number of successful heartbeats vs. failures). Heartbeats could be extended into what I'll call for the moment a PING-PONG. A farmer holding a file chunk can send a PING back to the client that says "Hi! I have your file chunk, can I get some of that lovely cryptocurrency?" However, with the PING the farmer also sends some currency that is protected until the transaction is completed (e.g. by an Oracle or eventually by an Ethereum contract, etc.). The client then sends a PONG which is a traditional heartbeat described in the paper. If everything goes well, the farmer gets paid for storing the chunks and gets the withheld fee back.
Newer farmers can have higher fees withheld than farmers with a greater reputation (e.g. as recorded on a blockchain). The withheld fee could also be the same regardless of how much storage you offer the network. The idea would be that if you only run a node or a few nodes (with as much space as you want), then losing that withheld fee would be a much smaller pain than someone running tens of thousands of micronodes that then shuts them off all at once. This also encourages decentralization of the network.
The idea is that it would be very expensive to mount such an attack, though not impossible.
Other factors that will help mitigation are creating a very large network. We also have nodes run by autonomous agents on the drawing board, but that's still in its very early stages.

All our code is available here: 
@_date: 2014-08-26 16:17:10
Metadisk dev here. The web-client is a gateway for folks to more easily interact with the Storj network and play with prototypes. There's still much more to do to make it more robust, but for more sensitive files we'll be rolling out a native version (though you also have the possibility of running your own Metadisk node within your local network). 
@_date: 2014-12-21 04:10:19
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:14:19

@_date: 2014-08-11 17:07:01
This is true, though I am developing a separate whitepaper to formalize a framework regarding autonomous server agents (I am the one who reached out to you on Twitter). I plan on applying it to Storj (little j) in the future, but at the moment there are not autonomous agents of the type gmaxwell described presently in our Storj (again, little j) project.

One of the nice benefits of Driveminer that I haven't seen mentioned so far on this thread is that, in addition to decentralizing your storage, you are decentralizing the income stream. We plan to make using Driveminer so easy that a regular family with some extra storage space on their external drives could make some passive income. Community groups could also bring in income for themselves as well (all they would need is an internet connection and some extra drive space). Maybe they wouldn't make as much money as someone with hundreds of terabytes of space to give, but even a small amount can make a huge difference.

It's fair to have tough questions and your questions should be answered, however you're probably getting downvoted because of your attitude.

Storj is still a young project, but we're working pretty hard building it up. The stronger the entire decentralized ecosystem of projects is, the better off we all are.

Yes, one of our primary goals is to have Dropbox-esque UX for software so, at a basic level, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to use it (while still allowing folks to dive as deep as they'd like). That being said, we first need to build everything out and test, so earlier on 'power users' will have an easier time.
Mobile is definitely on our mind, but we'll most likely be pushing stuff out for OSX/Windows/Linux desktops/servers first. MetaDisk could certainly be built out as a mobile app, though DriveShare would need more consideration (i.e. is it data-plan aware, how does that affect uptime, etc.).

To me, the most important contribution Bitcoin has made to society (more than any technological contribution, including the blockchain) is that it is allowing people to question beliefs they had taken for granted in a way they have never been able to before.

The MetaDisk demo is a proof-of-concept. The front-end is actually hosted on Digital Ocean. It encrypts a file and distributes them to free file hosts, storing location data on the Florincoin blockchain. When it's further along, it will use Factom, encryption etc. will be client-side.
Our farmer software is functional though and is in use for basic initial tests with Group A. You can see the farmers on live.driveshare.org (node uses downstream-node and farmers using downstream-farmer).
For an upcoming "round-trip" demo, I put together a wrapper for the libtorrent library (see github.com/storj/storjtorrent) and will integrate that with a fork of our upstream repo for file transfer.

You can check out our current whitepapers at [storj.io/storj.pdf]( and [metadisk.org/metadisk.pdf]( for the current state of affairs.
MaidSafe does not use blockchain tech but we do and we are building our own platform currently focused on decentralized storage (while MaidSafe has a much broader scope, though they've also been around since before Satoshi published his paper).
Some of our front-end apps (possibly MetaDisk) could potentially plug-in to MaidSafe in the future. We don't have any formal collaboration at the moment but I pop on their forums/Slack once in a while.

The current Metadisk node is a proof-of-concept that shards to free file hosts and stores file metadata to the Florincoin blockchain (though this is a stopgap and we'll almost certainly be using Factom when it's ready to rock).
The current test group A is using working farming software though, though at a basic level (mostly for us to collect statistics to inform future simulations and tests).

If anything I said is confusing or unclear if be happy to dig in further. It's not simply being hosted on a single vps.

Hard to say because we're growing something, but I'd say before end of 2015. You can sign up to our [mailing list]( to be kept up to date with progress.

I wrote a [wrapper for libtorrent]( called StorjTorrent that will use torrents for data transfer in the Storj network as part of our next iteration.
Micropayments to farmers will be handled automatically when the payment layer is integrated. No assembly required :)

My concern here is that the [shape/nature of the dice]( and how you roll them could influence the randomness and, potentially, the security of generated keys. It's true that most things are not "truly" random anyways, but this should still be considered.

Maybe James is just picking up his order in person from Butterfly Labs.

No need to downvote Peter's comments. He's offering a level-headed criticism. Just because folks don't agree doesn't mean their opinions have less value.

Our heartbeat libraries, specifically the Swizzle and Merkle verification schemes, are written in C++ and at the moment we're using libtorrent as well (though will likely switch to libswift shortly). We're a growing mixture of Python and C/C++. Python is very powerful and allows for quicker development, but we have been and will continue to use C/C++ where performance is paramount. The only Ruby thing we have is a Homebrew formula for OSX users. The only JS is for the live dashboard and for the MetaDisk web client interface.
I don't want to spam with a technical discussion about Storj, so if you have questions, concerns or helpful criticism about our current development status, I encourage you to post it on storjtalk.org, or even just e-mail me at josh

I'm a Storj dev and Opal made this announcement in response to a message I sent them. Their original "Opal Drive" announcement misrepresented where Storj was at and in a community of folks who are already suspicious and cautious (and justifiably so), this is completely unacceptable. I have no feelings (or even know that much) about Opal, but people should not be misinformed.
P.S. While there's not really a way I can prove it, no one on our team posted this article in I know some of you are tired of seeing Storj, etc. posts here but we don't encourage our own team members to post things here unless it relates more directly to Bitcoin. That being said, we are pretty active in answering questions about Storj on social media, so where Storj is mentioned you'll often find us :)

It's hard to take criticism seriously from a Reddit account that appears to have been created solely to spite Storj, but let's give it a go:
(1) It clearly says on the YouTube video page that it was created by Moda Prati. Shawn simply posted a link to the video -- how is that taking credit? The creator has already been heavily lauded on our forums.
(2) We had our MetaDisk demos up for quite a while and both downstream-farmer and downstream-node have seen a tremendous amount of work. We've been testing up to 100GB+ with the farming software now and are tweaking some performance issues before releasing it more broadly to the test group. I also wrote the 'storjtorrent' library (a libtorrent client/wrapper) and have started integrating it into our upstream library as a run-up to our 'round trip' test where we splice/encrypt files, send chunks to farmers and then retrieve them.
Is there a reason you created this account? We really try to make the effort to reach out to folks and address all criticism. If you have any concerns I'd be happy to address them.

A wild GitHub appeared :)

I think only DataCoin actually tried storing data on the blockchain itself, which is not what Storj (where I'm a dev) is doing. Also, MaidSafe itself is not blockchain-based at all (as they often strive to point out).

Hi -- the demo was actually made by one of our motivated community members :) You can [see his announcement here](

I love how they call it 'virtual currency' when our dollars are now essentially the same thing...
