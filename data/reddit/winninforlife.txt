I have a trezor and my bitcoin are there currently.  What is this UASF stuff and how do i move it over?
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:27:12
No I'm not keeping it on their shit online wallet. I'm jus interested in quick bitcoin purchase to transfer over. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:47:29
selling?  no.. I'm looking to buy

If you see 5-10 years as a get rich quick scheme.. you clearly are have a bad sense of time. 
Everyone can spout that bitcoin changing the world shit all day, and maybe it will.  But realistically this is an investment, in which we all hope to see a financial return.  This isn't some hipster trend about rebellion.. at least not to me.

Such as?

I didn't send anything.  I simply saw the word AGREE to entering the tor site and then quickly exited out.  Call me crazy but a icon on my iphone clicked itself so I reformatted my phone / wiped it.  Is my network compromised or something?  Please help as I'm not knowledgable on these things.

I'm using a mobile app wallet (AirBitz) on iOS. What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:18:44
What can it do ??
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:58:12
How large are we talking?  
Airbitz is secure. Why wouldn't I store it there?
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:53:02
What iOS wallet do u recommend?
@_date: 2017-06-26 13:00:39
I ended up getting Airbitz. Really liking it so far 
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:38:21
What's exactly happening August 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-29 18:33:35
Yea same. Just a bunch of fear mongering without any real evidence. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:19:25
What's a good hardware wallet I can purchase right now?  And how would I transfer bitcoin from airbitz to that?
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:16:30
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:11:31
Yes but if I can get my money transferred to my hardware wallet. Should I be alright?
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:12:15
I am storing it on my phone via a app wallet
@_date: 2017-06-29 03:27:21
I think we are all holding bitcoin to one day cash out....
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:06:08
I still don't have an answer to my question.  I'm going to keep my Bitcoin on a trezor.  I just want to purchase from coinbase.  What's wrong with that?
