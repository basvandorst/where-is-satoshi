Good point
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:17:42
Good argument! I bet you are a wonderful person.
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:15:13


That doesn't happen if instead of using the website blockchain.info you use their browser extension (which they recommend by the way)
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:14:23
How can an online wallet possibly be hacked without one noticing? It has 2fa, ssl. The advantages far outweigh the risk of losing the trezor 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:35:07
How exactly do you keep then safe? I don't trust myself to keep anything save, except what's in my head :)
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:08:30


Good points! I would argue that you will have to travel with either the trezor or your seed if you wish to spend bitcoins while traveling. And I'm more likely to lose the trevor or a piece of paper than my laptop. 


Blockchain uses newer wallet specification so if they go down forever you can still recover your coins with the passphrase. 
I would make another point. Blockchain.info is open source and I can check it's authenticity. How do you know if there isn't any hardware malware in the Trezor that would allow one to steal your bitcoins years into the future? Crazy idea but hey
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:26:43
Good point, but I would argue that this is less likely to happen than me losing a hardware and seed. Also if I lose my hardware wallet and need to recover using the seed, what happens if their site is down or have an outage? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:18:41
Using the blockchain chrome extension, instead of the site, solves that too. They actually recommend using the browser extension instead of the website. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:27:36
blockchain.info. Full control of your keys. If machine is compromised, no one can get access unless they also have your phone (2FA). How much more secure can it get? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:30:29
Also I can travel anywhere knowing I'm not carrying any bitcoins. If I'm carrying a hardware wallet there's always a risk i'll lose it. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:43:51
Very clever!!
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:28:13
Yeah, that's not an argument either kids. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:16:52


Yes but at what expense? The risk of my losing the thing or the seed is way higher than hackers getting access to my password, AND my 2FA. I never had a password hacked in my life, but I've lost a gazillion things. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:27:48
2FA solves that. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:38:29
IMO blockchain.info + 2fa is way more secure than a hardware wallet with a recovery seed, because: 
- it's easier to steal or lose the seed
- it's easier to steal or lose the hardware
- if anything happens with blockchain.info you're still protected with the 2FA. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:19:59
2FA doesn't have to be linked to my phone number. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 07:29:42
Roger Ver makes so much sense
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:50:57
Yeah lost one many times! Thanks for you contribution (Y)
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:24:17
Yubico, Authy, Duo.... they don't require any phone number. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:46:06


that's my point exactly. The risk of one losing their keys is higher than having them stolen (if you use strong passwords, 2fa, browse extension etc). 
@_date: 2016-06-14 06:58:29
I see. Thank you. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:08:45
I think the home page should be about "what the hell is OpenBazaar", since if have no clue what it is, instead of an automatic download. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:11:27
So what exactly has balance? My understanding was that wallets (a bunch of numbers for the public key + a bunch of number for the private key) had balances associated with it. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:36:58
Thank you
@_date: 2016-06-13 07:15:16
Very good guys thank you. I have never seen these HD wallets and got confused as I was used to the old model.
@_date: 2017-04-16 17:02:37
Ad hominem

You can't compare VISA (a company) with GOLD (a commodity). It's like comparing Amazon.com's market cap with the global market value of coffee. If you keep bitcoin just as a store of value, another coin will become a store of value + payment method and take away all bitcoin's market share (thinking of Dash).
@_date: 2016-09-08 00:36:56
That would work for you until you need to get a mortgage. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:24:12
Hahaha excellent 
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:11:12
It's also the one with the highest fees and longest confirmation time. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:57:25
Reminiscent of a time when fees and confirmation times were lower. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:17:26
Could have done the 2mb fork 2 years ago and we wouldn't have $5 fees and congestion.  He isn't going to change his opinion
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:32:03
I actually want a team that wouldn't have allowed this mess to happen with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:58:51
It's actually bitcoin core that has been blocking a blocksize increase for the past 2 years. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 20:54:51
Why not blockchain.info? They don't store your keys, security is excellent. I wouldn't trust myself storing on dedicated hardware as they can be lost or stolen.
