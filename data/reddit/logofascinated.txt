That's a very open-ended question. So if anyone's interested in an outsider's perspective:
I've only recently got into Bitcoin, and while I think it's an incredible idea, and I do wish for success, I'm very pessimistic.
The reason is that it's too complex and unfriendly for most people, and there doesn't seem to be any movement to simplify it for the average person in the street. I don't see how, in its present state, it can ever escape from being a small niche. It took me a while to figure it all out, and I'm an IT professional.
Please, Redditors, tell me I'm wrong and that my semi-computer-illiterate friends will be earning and spending BTC in five years' time!

I don't get it. You mean that Usenet popularity has followed that pattern since Eternal September?
@_date: 2017-01-23 22:02:04
You're entirely missing the point here.

Ask yourself: what force is it that compels the price to adhere to a straight line on a graph? 
You're looking for a trend without any evidence for a trend other than your attempt to draw a straight line. Life ain't that simple.

Thanks, I see what you mean now. I'd never heard the term being used outside of the Usenet context.

Exactly. Very, very few people would continue to use it if holding and/or trading was outlawed (so the value would plummet, with inevitable consequences). Most of us would rather stay on the right side of the law, even if it's a law we disagree with.
It's staggering that so many people in Bitcoin circles sincerely believe that millions of Americans (not to mention the rest of the world) would be so enamoured with Bitcoin that they'd become criminals just to keep using it.

OK, I'll explain. I like Bitcoin. I have Bitcoin. Bitcoin is very nice. Bitcoin is private and secure, and it gives us control. Much better than RFID. OK?
But, I think Bitcoin is in more danger than a lot of people realise, because of the Government outlaws it it will make Bitcoin unattractive for most people.
Do you see the difference here?

I'm amazed that they didn't know the @ sign. It was pretty much common knowledge long before the internet.
A typical use would be in an invoice, eg:
    12 loaves @ 50p per loaf = £6.00

This is true. And school would be insufferable, even if the lessons and exams were rather easy.
And to go through puberty again, with the hormones and acne and everything? No thanks.

It would be nice to be young again, but I'm rather cynical about the idea that I could make billions if I were 10 years old now.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:05:56
I would. I'm 56 and poor.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:32:36
Ah, I didn't read in the time travel factor. In that case, you're right, there'd be all sorts of additional advantages, not even restricted to money-making.

Your reasoning tells us more about you and your ideology than about any threats to Bitcoin.

I don't know much about Bitcoin, but answer me something: 
So what happens if a government - say the US government - declares that Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are aiding terrorists, etc, and henceforth anyone found dealing in Bitcoin could be prosecuted and sentenced to up to 50 years in prison.
Surely that would stop the adoption of Bitcoin dead in its tracks, at least in that country, and crash the value of BTC as everyone converts back to US$? Very few people would take the risk of having anything to do with Bitcoin. Repeat that for all other countries with a similar agenda.
Or is there a flaw in my logic here?
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:24:31
With all due respect, I think you're *massively* overestimating how much the average citizen knows - or cares - about Bitcoin.
Governments can outlaw it quickly and easily, and the vast majority of the population will seriously not give a fuck. We're a long way from any revolution, loud and violent or not.
@_date: 2016-07-24 18:46:54
So you think there'll be a revolution if governments outlaw Bitcoin? And yet other rights (the right to a trial, the presumption of innocence, habeus corpus, protection from torture, privacy, etc) have disappeared with only a tiny proportion of the populace even voicing an opinion, let alone protesting in any way.
What makes you think that people would be so outraged by the outlawing of Bitcoin - which is something that only a small minority is currently using anyway, even when it's perfectly legal?


I'm not sure who you're addressing here. I'm not advocating any of these things, and neither am I advocating the outlawing of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 20:50:14


You really think that the average person ("sheeple" or not) would use Bitcoin if it was made illegal and they faced a heavy custodial penalty? I doubt that a fraction of 1% of the population would even consider it. And how is Bitcoin to thrive if barely anybody uses it?
I admire your enthusiasm, believe me I do, but not your grasp on reality.

From the article:


From reality: 
EDIT: Downvoted for correcting a misapprehension? Oh, \/r\/Bitcoin, you're living up to your reputation.

I agree that the government's motives for wanting to shut down Bitcoin are highly dubious.
In particular, this will be as a result of the close, cosy and corrupt relationship between banks and the government - Bitcoin has the potential to crush banks' grasping hold on our countries' economies, and I doubt very much that this will be allowed to progress much further than it already is. The lawmakers are much too deeply involved with the banks to allow this to happen.
Of course, this won't be given as the reason for curbs. Citing the threat of terrorism will be sufficient to persuade most people that cryptocurrencies should be outlawed.
What we really need are governments who are less dependent on the banks for support, and who have the courage to defy the financial sector. Perhaps that might happen - I desperately hope so, but recent events in the UK and the USA make me think this is unlikely to happen for a long time, if ever.
