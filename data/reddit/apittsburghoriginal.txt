This is what confuses me. People that hold criticize those that sell, but sellers can just set a stop buy once it tumbles far enough. So if/when it bounces back you don’t miss out on it. Am I missing something egregiously obvious?

I’m one of the newbies, but it doesn’t take a genius to go digging and look at the historical charts. I feel like if you weren’t there for it, you should know about it

If we can make a good run @ 8pm EST (when Asian market plays) we may be okay.

Isn’t that most anything in life? It all boils down to the value you derive from it. Pretty much everybody here is at-least partially in it for the fiat, but there has to be people that find more value in the thrill of the game.

Shite, so it’s not a reputable source?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:02
When people put those Bitcoin trends between 2015-present I lol at the fact that they chose to conveniently exclude 2014

When everybody told me it was a hacker Enron pyramid scam that was out to get me. And then I got to laugh at them.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:11:23
Still, just a lousy $50 put on Bitcoin at the end of April, 2013. Not committal in the least and would be valued at over $4000 right now.

Does that explain why BTC and LTC seem to be so intrinsically linked in market movement? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:15:52
It messed things up. Litecoin absolutely took a hit  on that.

Is the explosion at the end representative of BCH? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:00:30
He did turn his life around which is a huge plus for anybody. However he also has been completely skeptical about bitcoin, totally thinking it was in a bubble. Which makes it somewhat ironic to make this meme.

Don’t need to EMP the world, just close all of the exchanges.

Trust somebody who won’t steal your bitcoin wealth and give them 20% for managing it.

And then 20 years later run Olympic marathons.

Litecoin community hates him too.

I think historically it’s just a bad time for crypto. But that could change now that it has more mainstream relevance.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:05:40
Well, there it is. Honestly I can see a plus 20k avg by Q2 next year. After tax returns and Sachs opens their trading desks in June it should be in good waters. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:27:15
Maybe. But if all of the exchanges closed right now and trading was frozen, cryptos would be starved to a slow death.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:08
What could ultimately happen is the introduction of a new coin by a major company, like Amazon. They could create a coin that holds low transaction fees and is scalable but also holds value based on the company incorporating it. Thus, adoption phase is skipped and a lot of alt coins lose relevance.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:02:56
That’s what I’m trying to do. I don’t think it’s a bad idea honestly.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:01:08
I mean I just kind of bought some crypto with fuck around $ that I literally do not miss. If it rebounds to crazy moon surges again, great, I just added a bonus payment to my Roth. If not, whatever.

By apocalypse I mean, go to $200 and stagnate forever
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:44:43
True. The only thing that would mess it up would be if it maintained outrageous fees and downtime between transfers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:30:30
It’s going to keep going down. It might get to 9-10k. But it should close out around 3-5k in the near future. That’s what my crystal ball shows. After that, it’s either a steady road to recovery or apocalypse.
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:49:11
They’ll always follow suit
