Btc has kind of always been serious. It used to be mostly like silk road stuff didn't it?

Everyone holds BTC so it has terrible liquidity. Then when it gets high they dump it and the price crashes. How is this a good system?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:17:55
Like that guys that accidently threw out that hard drive with his wallet.dat containing millions in BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-10 21:32:42
Cash --&gt; BTC...
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:45:49
Bitcoin is meant to be a currency. You are supposed to spend it, like a currency, and not treat it like a stock.

Windows is only popular because all the computers people buy have windows preinstalled. Linux distro's like Mint are easier to use than Windows.

Since BTC value has gone down you wouldn't be making any gain.

So is the USD then.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:09:49
$17? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:56:02
Okay, now I can tell you're trolling.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:13:59
Like people don't lose money in the stock market... 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:17:54
The USD has no value other than what people accept it to have but it is even worse than Bitcoin because it isn't in the hands of the people but rather a single entity, the federal reserve.

In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they’ll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy.
A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. Early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters. Bitcoin has possible win-win outcomes. Early adopters profit from the rise in value. Late adopters, and indeed, society as a whole, benefit from the usefulness of a stable, fast, inexpensive, and widely accepted p2p currency.
The fact that early adopters benefit more doesn't alone make anything a Ponzi scheme. All good investments in successful companies have this quality.
