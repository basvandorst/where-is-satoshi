Good point. Do you suggest I link to Wikipedia or change the title to something like a "Pyramid Scheme"?

In case with Bitcoin, there only variable that impacts its value is the demand; scarcity is controlled by an algorithm. In many ways, this is like the Tulip Mania ( where people were buying something which they thought would be worth a lot in the future, and it turned out, it was nothing but ordinary.
Many people made money, much like Bc early adopters will with Bitcoin, but it doesn't mean the demand is read, imo.

Personally, I have never seen it before. So far, all I've seen is people praising Bitcoin for the world-dominating value that it will have. It's all about the upside, and never the downside; at least among the articles that I've seen.

I never said that something that's digital doesn't have value. You must be referring to my point about OkCupid and other digital goods, that you can buy with Bitcoin.
What I am saying is that digital goods, which you can buy on Black Friday, are all value that could be given away for free. It's not the same as nog having value.
Reddit Gold has a lot of value, but $USD is not the only way to acquire it. More importantly, it does not cost Reddit (as a company) anything to give it away.
It doesn't matter if bitcoin is worth $0.01 or $10,000 USD today, the company loses very little by selling their "gold" for Bitcoins.

Say you are selling a car. It's worth $40,000 today, which is 40 Bitcoins.
You sold the car and got the coins.
Tomorrow, the value of the coin plummets to $10/coint, and all of a sudden you're only holding on to $400 , and not $40,000. Overnight, you lost everything.
This has certainly happened before in the past with real currencies. I suspect it will happen to Bitcoint as well, but faster, as in my opinion, current value of the coin is not tied to anything other than artificially created demand. 
Personal opinion, but that's what it is, opinion. Ideas welcomed!

I don't, but I'd be happy to explore further if you can point me to a place that's buying/selling physical goods with Bitcoin in a sustainable manner.
The least I want is to sell my car for 10 Bitcoins today, only to realize that tomorrow these 10 coins are only capable of buying a loaf of bread.

Do you guys seriously not understand that if you were somewhat wealthy and an early adopter, it would be totally in your favor to run a Bitcoin marketplace ?
It is irrelevant how much Bitcoin is today, as long as your run the marketplace and the value of Bitcoin keeps going up. All you need to do is just sell early enough, and you still make money.
As long as you're not 1 second too late to sell, you make a huge return.
Your ability to make money does not mean that it's the right thing, or good for others.

Thank you for editing. I was in fact looking to see what people think about Bitcoin, whether I am right or wrong. It's upsetting that most of the comments are along the lines of : "shut up, stupid." Instead of having a thoughtful discussion, all I am getting are ego-boosted responses from those who claim to know better, but won't say. Anyways, that aside.
By "Ponzie Scheme", I am referring to the nature of Bitcoin transactions at this moment, where the price is being inflated ever so hard, by more and more people joining to buy. The only variable that currently controls the value is the demand, and that is only sustainable while new players are willing to enter the market.
Unlike a Tesla stock, Bitcoin machine isn't going to produce new/better cars and sell them to public. It's just going to product more coins until it stops, and when it stops, there will be no more incentive for speculative trade, and the value of the coin may(or not) plummet.
This may take 3 more years, until the volume of coins reaches to 21m. It may also happen tomorrow, but unlikely. All said, I want to know how people think about it, and what the general understanding is, so I could make better decisions.

I am all for early adopters benefitting, but there will be a time when Bitcoin plummets, and there will be a group of people that will be seriously hurt by that. Early adopters (presumably) understand that, but now that Bitcoin is becoming popular, there will be innocent souls that will get burnt.

I think that Bitcoin early adopters are doing exactly what stock traders do every day; and much like most people are oblivious to speculation on the stocks, they are willing to ignore the real speculative nature of the Bitcoin.
