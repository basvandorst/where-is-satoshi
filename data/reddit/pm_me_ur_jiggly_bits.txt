It's called arbitrage and lots of people (and bots) do it when they can.
But you need to consider the time it takes to buy at coinbase, transfer to BTC-e and sell again. Is the price going to be the same by then? Also take in to account fees involved at each site.

I might be misunderstanding you but there wasn't any "tumbling" in what you described.
I think what you've described:
You have address A at blockchain.info. 
You start up your PC with tor and bitcoin-qt, and create address B. 
You send from A to B and then from B to some other address C (service or merchant address)
This really does nothing to obscure your transactions. Anyone can easily look at the blockchain and see your coins move from A to B to C. Using TOR only hides your IP address, but your IP address isn't stored on the blockchain anyway.


It doesn't compare at all. Your probably a bit confused about what tumbling is too, here's a decent explanation: 
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:27:20
It's not really your problem. It's up to the buyer to secure their address.

Slightly offtopic and pretty minor gripe about changetip. But when withdrawing from changetip does anyone know how to set the amount in bitcoins? [This]( is the withdraw form. It seems a little backwards. I'm working with bitcoins, I don't want to withdraw a dollar amount I want to withdraw a bitcoin amount. Also it doesn't specify which dollar that is (USD, AUD, CAD...). At the very least there should be an option to select currency.
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:30:21


Yeah, my changetip account says i have $X.XX but when i try withdraw $X.XX it just grays out the send button without even saying why. if I try send one cent less than what's in my account it works, but i imagine that's really confusing for a decent amount of users.

Just reading the paragraph on the homepage it looks like they just tried to fit as many meaningless buzzwords in to two sentences as they could rather than write anything meaningful about what they do. "MSEMs: Massive Super-Efficient Machines" That's a completely meaningless acronym that they just made up to try sound impressive.
It looks like they're just another cloud mining company. Many people say that cloud mning itself is a scam. I think that as long as the cloudmining company operates just as they say they do it's not really a scam. It's up to customers to decide if it's worth it (which in almost every single case it isn't)
These guys are still in the process of setting up and aren't selling anything yet. They haven't even put up what rates they're selling at. It's hard to really say anything about them being a scam or not until they start doing something and give some more details.

Highly recommend not using igot. I did all of the verification requirements that they asked for. Their verification page showed i was verified to be able to withdraw 500btc per day.
I bought bitcoins late last week. I tried to withdraw my bitcoins from them two days ago. This morning it still hadn't transferred and so i contacted their support. They said that I needed to do more verification because of a recent update to their rules (that came about yesterday afternoon, after i had requested the withdrawal).
If i hadn't contacted their support i wouldn't have even known about this extra requirement (it's still not even shown on their verification pages but hidden in the help if you search for it). I've asked their support some more questions about this requirement and they've just stopped answering my questions.
All round just a really bad experience with them, and as soon as i get this bitcoin from them i won't be using them again.
I used coinjar before and only changed because of the 10% GST. 
I think kraken is also an option, which is what i'll be looking into for next time.
edit: on top of that after waiting for two days for the transfer, they've now transferred with no fee and it's still sitting with no confirmations after three hours.

Your question is a bit confusing. 


It never took 30 minutes to transfer bitcoins, confirmations have always averaged 10 minutes. Some services make you wait for 3 confirmations (which might be where you're getting 30 minutes from), others don't need any confirmations and transactions will be instant. So this is really a service specific question and since we don't know what services you were using I can't really answer that.


This part is pretty vague and i don't really know what you're asking.

Uh, what were they expecting it to buy? It says it was using the Agora market. And while there's a bunch of non-illegal items there, it should surprise no one that there's also a large amount of illegal items.
They whole article seems a bit silly. If i stuck a gun to a robot that just randomly drove around and pulled the trigger i don't think i would find anyone that would argue that I'm not responsible for it when someone gets shot.

They're horrible to deal with. Their customer service really really sucks.
I completed their initial verification and their web page said i was good to buy/withdraw a large amount (i think up to 500btc or something). When i did try withdraw it didn't go through, just sat pending for a day. I had to contact customer service about it (they didn't contact me, there was no detail on the website about what was happening), and apparently i needed to do more verification because i used bpay to deposit cash(again, at the time nothing on the website about that). I did the verification and was able to withdraw the next day. The next time I bought the same thing happened. I was told I needed to do the verification again. I messaged back saying that I'd already done it which was just ignored. They made me do a skype verification which had to be scheduled a day or so later. During the skype call the basically just said "oh, you've already done this? we'll transfer now".
Despite their front page saying that transfers are bitcoin instant they are all done manually and can take hours. Customer service told me that transfers actually are automatic and instant once you have bought a certain amount (didn't specify how much). But I've bought more than a few thousand dollars worth there and transfers still take hours.
I would only recommend them as a last option. I was previously using coinjar and was happy with it until they started doing the GST. After they stopped the added GST thing i tried to use coinjar again, but they needed more verification. The only reason I'm using iGot now is that I'd have to go through some verification process again if I switched to some other exchange and despite the major initial hassle getting started it's going relatively smoothly now.
tldr: iGot really really suck to get started with. Use coinjar or something else.

You don't need to trade bitcoins to use them. 
If I'm going to europe I don't need to have any knowledge on how euro/usd is traded. I just buy my euro and then go spend it.


Got examples? The ones i can think of are all people who were trying to trade (mtgox) not people who were just using bitcoins.

Even if it is against the reason bitcoin was made, so what? It wasn't made just for a certain group of people to use. Anyone can use it. If you or anyone else don't like a service provided by someone, you can not use it and just manage your coins yourself.

He should just describe what he wants. He doesn't need to describe the implementation of it. That's what you're paying someone for. Unless you need a specific implementation (then you should already know what it is)

You need to layout all your info clearly in one post. From what i understand you've deposited bitcoin to cryptothrift. Then you won an auction and now you want to know how to send the seller your money, right?
At this point you aren't really using bitcoin (this is "offchain"), you're using cryptothrifts own internal database. i.e. when the transaction is made, nothing happens on the blockchain. Just some records in cryptothrifts database changes saying buyer now has 0BTC and seller has 0.19BTC. When you withdraw from cryptothrift you're back to "using bitcoin" again.
As for how to do that transaction on cryptothrift.
This is from cryptothrifts FAQ




So all you need to do is go click on that release escrow button. If you can't find that button you should contact cryptothrifts support.

How so?


To the average person using bitcoin that's irrelevant. What the receiver does with it has no effect on the user.


And as i mentioned. You don't need to trade bitcoin to use it. Any examples of trading scams that effected people that weren't trading?
@_date: 2015-02-02 07:35:40
You don't need to know how bitcoin is created or traded to be able to use it. I'd be surprised if 5% of people understood how fiat is created or how it's secured or how credit cards work.
