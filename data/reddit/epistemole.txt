A professor gave you a 0 for a submitted essay? Not an F, but a 0? And with zero feedback whatsoever? If your story is true, I apologize, but it sounds incredible.

Yes, yes. You got a 4.0 but you don't even know the difference between "its" and "it's." And sure, a professor gave you a 0 without giving you any feedback whatsoever or any partial credit whatsoever. I can't believe people are posting serious replies to your story.

Try and write down exactly how it would generate infinite money. If you try to articulate it in math, you will realize that it doesn't work the way you think it does.

Assuming this post is real. Don't do it kid. No one knows whether there will be a rally in May. Assuming there will be one is simpleminded.

What sort of university was this?

This hilariously ridiculous. You can also go ahead and add up the value of all cars in the world, all cropland in the world, all fishing claims in the world, etc. Of course everything in the world has value.  
The value is quantity x price. The reason these are worth so much is that either there's a lot of quantity, a lot of price, or both.  
Bitcoin has a relatively fixed 'quantity'. The only way for it achieve those levels is for the price to go up. So basically this post says "...the price should go up..."
