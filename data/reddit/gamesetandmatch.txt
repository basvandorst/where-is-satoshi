Dip Appreciation. 9 Billion BTC Volume today, dropped to the same volume traded on Nov 30th 2017 - except now the market cap is 14B higher w/ BTC price 8% higher, even in the ‘dip’ ($9750 vs $10,500-ish). The next swing upward should be juicy from here, whether today, tomorrow, next wk, next month etc…

Defensive long stance on BTC is to HODL 90% and short 10%, no? I am wondering whether to do this...

Oh the irony: "A handful of old BlackBerrys, located in a storage room in the Thalberg basement, were given to executives."

Yeah it’s the greed factor... enticed by btc, feeling the bubble is 9k + right before the split, for sake of efficiency as you say am looking at rapid btc purchase via eth / ltc transfer... or should I stay? Damned if I do damned if I don’t - although more btc regards of price is a good thing; am HODL on btc not touching that stack. As per this thread looking at 1 btc ownership, while trying to gauge the ‘market’ ... alts eth / ltc also hold promise but are they HODL material? more thoughts appreciated, cheers !

Very happy using exodus, sia, iota, Jaxx &amp; neo wallet while coinspot has a diverse range of cypto to exchange ... HODL!

With btc off to the races before the upcoming fork, would you transfer eth &amp; ltc over to btc to up that stock, or keep alts and wait for the post rise?

It will bounce off 3700s like it did a few weeks ago and slowly climb

Thinking of selling eth and ltc to add to btc to make 1 whole btc. Guys would you sell eth &amp; ltc to make a whole btc or keep it split 50/50 (half alts half btc)?

Thanks, yeah, I’ll keep it diversified so to speak. Also have some PAY, XRP on my other wallets, am pondering Monero, Dash and a few others, how far afield do you all throw your net, how do you decipher which coins to flick some fiat into - or do you stick with the top of the crypto crop?
