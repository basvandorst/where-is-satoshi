Also combined with the amount of coins in cold storage with the oft-repeated advice to keep funds off exchanges. Can't panic sell if you have a built-in cooling-off period.

Hey, at least the exchanges are still up.  That's progress!

Why would such a non-answer be anything but downvoted?

Do you not see anything suspicious with the amount of votes this received in such a short amount of time? Who profits by artificially inflating the karma of this post?

I know how you feel.  I had a hundred or so BTC on Mt. Gox, and worked my way down to a couple tens over the various various flash crashes in 2013.  Since then, only HODL.  I am not smarter than the market.

Daytrading is the problem. It's just gambling. If I hadn't tried to beat the market in 2012-13 through all the MTGOX fuckery, I'd still have many multiple times the number of BTC I have today, and I could have retired before 30. 
Get your coins off the exchanges and hodl, my friend.

It's going to feel pretty tempting when I can cover my mortgage with my hodlings.

You just didn't wait long enough.

Seems to be back up.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:18:48
Yeah, been down for a couple minutes for me. Seems pretty irresponsible if this is the planned maintenance.

It was a big part of it.  The lag was atrocious.  The ~6% drop we just saw would have been much worse with the kind of lag we were dealing with then.
The distribution of the load over many exchanges has done a lot to protect against another catastrophic crash as in April.

No, but the company has a fairly solid track record, and I believe it to be in their interest to keep trade volume on their exchange high.

The satoshi is arbitrary, though.  The finest division could just as easily be 100 quadrillion.

It was hovering just over $155 when it went down.

That's just residual jiggle on the pole.

No, it shows the German symbol, but that's how a lot of people read that ligature.
