I’ve never had any problems with bovada. About as legit as it gets with online gaming,,,I believe they moved to a btc option in the past 2 years (soo before it was super mainstream).

This is exactly what turns away institutional money from crypto...
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:49:57
what’s the point of  futures/wallstreet keeping the price low as long as possible ? Wouldn’t they make more money just letting it rocket to 6 figures ?!?!? 
Also, I dont understand is Whose paying for the “long/shorts” that are wrong?!?! It’s a bet right ? if a player wins, where does that house money come from ?!?!?...
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:23:25

thanks to Wallstreet/futures....btc has become the latest way for the already wealthy to become even wealthier....when this was created, satoshi never imagined that it would be suppressed and manipulated by all these wallstreet deep pockets...interesting to see what happens to the market 
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:03:25
Close enough loll just make a weekend trip outta it. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:02:11
Dude what really matters is to check the top ten bag holders....hundreds of thousands of coins never ever moved/used 
who knows how many the winklevoss have
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:25:09
Ok that is understandable. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:11:34

@_date: 2018-06-21 23:50:48
coinbase is from the Bay Area,,,,so is Charlie lee..it’s the wild Wild West,,,it’s a very small crypto world, so yeah the actual brains in the industry will try to profit off of ppl as much as they can (as evident by this ad on the busiest portion of Hwy 101). 
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:07:57
is it always going to stay at a dollar ?!?! If that’s the case, I don’t understand how it works ??

why are you upset ? I can tell you’re very educated about btc,,,,what’s the issue? did u lose coins or were you expecting a massive bull run this year for your murcielago ? You seem really upset ?!?!?
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:23:37
There’s not gonna be 21 millionb in circulation ,,,,satoshi kept some (I think a million) and it’s estimated that about 2-3 million will be lost, seized, forgotten keys, etc. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:33:31
just take it as a war loss,,,,you’ll just lose more money, time &amp; effort hiring a lawyer. 6 BCH isn’t that much anyway next time double check your addresses so it doesn’t happen again. Or email roger Vera’s team and see if they can find the transaction or something 
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:20:51

Yes, they had at least two kids (from the headline picture they both looked around 10yrs old ).
That family is the definition of Hardcore btc enthusiasts loll hoDL is life loll 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:51:56
That’s the plan !! we just gotta get what we comfortable with &amp; put it away...we know how this works (it’ll rocket again one day soon) 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:51:38
Nope. Holiday weekend, everyone in wallstreet out wine-ing, dinning &amp; 69’ing...No btc talk until Tuesday mornday 
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:07:01
this thing is waaay too manipulated at this point. Ridiculous 10 years in play and it’s at $4300 
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:48:24
earlier this year people were predicting 50K eoy 2018 ?!?? 
@_date: 2018-11-18 01:26:25
wtf ?!?!
@_date: 2018-11-24 09:36:35
I’m over it. 
price predictions or TA don’t mean shit. Just people pulling numbers out their arse!
What happened to 50K eoy 2018? that African American dude (idk his name) interviewed, wearing all black v neck shirt on this same news network ?!?!?! I know I’m not the only one who remembers that interview 
@_date: 2018-11-08 07:20:43
dude that place is worse than a war zone,,,,no electricity...no food or medicine, horrible horrible wages....I’m surprised there hasn’t been a mass exodus like we see in other parts of the world where they just leave the war torn countries/conflict zones with the clothes on their backs ?!?!? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:13:15
let the man dream 
@_date: 2018-11-08 01:15:40
Thats crazy...I don’t understand how that population (at all social levels) doesn’t flee that country...you’d think a place like that would have a mass exodus by now (situation hasn’t improved in like 10 years). 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:25:20
I agree. Everyone was super “sure” it wouldn’t break the 7k level or 6K level or 5K level...fucken rekkt!! All bets are off I wouldn’t be surprised if we go below 1k

@_date: 2018-11-22 01:56:52
Or the family with a couple kids that sold “everything” they owned for btc &amp; they had to live in tents ?!?!they made headlines I remember reading about them 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:23:39
might even be Lower than that!! All bets are off at this point (everyone kept saying “it had support” at 7k, 6k, 5k range, etc),,,if we lucky we level out at the 1-2K range loll jeeezus how did this happen 
@_date: 2018-11-24 08:08:55
This thing is waaay too manipulated it’s out completely out of hand. Ten years in play &amp; we hovering at $4300 &amp; dropping right before an exchange opens up ?!?! come on now 
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:13:07
TA is literally just people guessing...just blowing smoke up your arse

Nope. They are posers that dont even know about Vegeta loll 
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:49:32
more importantly, they became a top5 whale overnight....they might even have more than the winklevoss twins or any Chinese whales or Wallstreet whales 
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:08:58
I smell a bull run coming 
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:50:24
they became a top5 whale (maybe even top3) overnight....that’s what’s most important (a fact). 
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:15:50
I feel btc is being dumped because of one particular incident that happened earlier this year,,,
some Eastern European country (I think it was Bulgaria) where the authorities came up on a huge stack of btc from some mafia ring,,,,the authorities confiscated like 200,000 bitcoins (no typo)!!! they basically became a top 3 whale overnight. 
Certain people may not want that country to have That much btc lol so of course if the price gets dumped “maybe” they will sell it off?!?!?  
@_date: 2018-07-16 04:42:50
Loll,,,the pelligrino water....Supreme fanny pack...eating pizza with a fork,,,,paying with crypto
