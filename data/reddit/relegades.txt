I have 4K from a withdrawal from a poker website just frozen, not thrilled that BTC is down 10%...in the meantime bought $5K worth of BCH after some research
I still have ~2K on that online casino too that I have to withdraw, fucking sucks that I might be clogged of 2K for a while...may have to do a check instead

IDK about you, but I'm ready to buy ~1 BTC as soon as we see a correction soon. This growth is (very likely) not sustainable.

Why are you so stuck up about his wording? People don't buy 100% of a house on the spot, it's commonplace to take out a mortgage.

Sounds like paying off student loans + a down payment for a house....

You still need to try and deep scan the drive, for 1.5M there should be no dispute on whether or not you should. Should take ~1-2 hours at least, let me know how it goes :D
Search for wallet.dat afterwards.

I would evaluate why I'd make up a bullshit story for attention

Regardless, there's still a chance that he can retrieve files or info he forgot about relating to that wallet
