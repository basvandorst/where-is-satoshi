I don’t believe so. Maybe my old shop was?

I tattoo in NYC and accept bitcoin. Let’s fucking party

So far in life the only currency I’ve turned down is someone who offered me drugs as trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:58:00
Unsure about the industry as a whole, but I’ve been about it for years.  I’m stuck on you saying cash is a pain though, In what way? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:47:30
consider it a mixed media tattoo. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 22:42:37
XL if still available! This is amazing
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:14:57
would gladly assist on graphics/banners/front end. in.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:24:33
no problem. i've got one more in the works that i'll dump in the next few days that is based on old route 66 motel signs from the 60's.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:37:32
backed. i sold what little holdings i had in metals this morning, will be going all in on BTC. 
i was sick of watching gold and silver depreciate in value after years of people saying they were bound to go up blah blah blah. should've thrown in on bitcoin earlier than i have already.

No Egrets tattoo in Clarksville Tennessee. I post a lot if work to my IG 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:10:54
this brings up a point i've actually been discussing with my friends when it comes to BTC and the mainstream. How long will it be before you start seeing rappers writing songs about starting in the hood and getting bitcoin rich? BITCOIN RULES EVERYTHING AROUND ME. etc. I had ended up drawing this guy and posting it earlier in the week but it seems relevant to the post &gt;&gt;&gt;[Imgur]( and i'll be so excited when this kinda thing becomes real. rappers making it rain satoshis on strippers with QR's on their ass. ONE DAY.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:47:35
its crossed my mind, trust me. unfortuneately human skin doesn't retain the clarity necessary for functional barcodes or qr codes in the long term. i'd be more inclined to tattoo a frame on myself somewhere within which i could apply temp tattoos that i print out so i could always change out the code as necessary.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:09:25
I told him to buy at 230, 300, and maybe even 500 if i remember correctly hah.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:27:04
i'm still so lost on depth charts
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:09:48
maybe we have to aim lower. BITCOIN TO CLEVELAND!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:38:14
I think people have been misunderstanding me here, I have zero intention of tattooing these on myself or anyone, at most id do frame tattoos with temp tattoo filler.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:46:42
I still resist the idea of QR tattoos. Human skin has a hard time keeping up with detail oriented stuff like this years down the road . If anything the idea of permanent frames with temp QRs sounds more effective
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:33:51
this is so fascinating. so this has been a problem for a while?
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:28:58
its .000002 btc you didn't have before!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:47:27
I'm not opposed to the idea, I'll have to pick up some of that temp tattoo paper, I'm pretty sure they make a version for consumer use. 
And yes exactly, super tough to get the code right, and it just wouldn't hold up in the long run. Temp QR means you have a lot more options
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:14:28
I included the blank frames for anyone in the community who may want to use them for accepting payments on their own wallet. have fun with them, feel free to donate if you appreciate them. I'll likely be doing more of these, so if you have any idea/requests, bring it up! This sub has been the majority of my free time lately, felt like giving something back.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:53:53
might not be a terrible idea, take top 5 alt coins, throw 50 bucks in each. If any take off it could well be worth investing in a spread.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:13:41
watching the charts, people are panicking hard.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:44:35
they block you from playing in the US. satoshidice told me so.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:18:27
i've got the exact same setup runnning on my monitors. look at those charts moooove!
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:42:16
hah. what a bunch of cunts
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:10:25
i'd like 0.00423 slice.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:38:16
oooooh. where ever did you nab those little usb cables from? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:42:06
oh yeah, its been a minute since i was there but pretty rad either way. i need an alternative to slashdot. that place has the most butthurt troll filled comment sections.
@_date: 2013-11-17 03:05:47
wait. what?
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:49:56
ahhhhhh. nice. well maybe i'll talk the shop owner into using that then, he doesn't seem as keen on holding BTC. i however, would like to tattoo for BTC so i can hold/spend/have the option to convert to fiat as necessary.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:43:07
take my advice as coming from someone who does this for a living, I really advise against QR tattoos based on their high level of detail in a given area. I just can't imagine them healing well over time. Get temp tattoo QRs and put them in real tattoo frames, you can change up a wallet address if feel like it, y'know?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:26:00
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:36:24
i have yet to throw away my life on satoshi dice, although i just found out about it like yesterday. do i have to play through tor if i'm in the US?
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:35:14
Thanks, do you run/work at a print shop? My idea had been to print off short runs of stickers off of stickerapp.com , which so far has been the best place I've found for small batch runs.  I really only think if need a few for my studio and convention gear 
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:26:04
THE INFORMATION WANTS TO BE FREE. Sorry man I spend too much time in haha. Thanks much.
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:38:47
thats a pretty brilliant way to setup the block eruptors, I haven't seen anyone else use that arrangement. any stills photos so i can creep this thing further? i'm such a fan of the raspi mining setups.
I recently picked up a 60$ powered hub used for 16$ (+s&amp;h), 4 eruptors bundled at ~12$ a piece (free shipping!), and i'm pretty sure my gf is getting me a pi for christmas (dat free tho). I'm psyched to have a very low ROI target when i put it all together.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:18:06
where are you picking these up so cheap? best deals i've seen on them so far are still in the 17-25$ range.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:36:31

@_date: 2013-12-02 20:04:19

now i can replace my hat made of money.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:39:58
I want planning on making it permanent yet, but I had thought of this approach. Good thinkin
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:49:43
Man that link is awesome. Looks like I have my morning reading. Time for coffee
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:41:20
Is that typical? I just made a wallet to accept payments to, to which I could move things to alternate wallets or cold storage etc. still new to this
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:55:44
Ssyyyrrrrriiiaaaann. Dude I miss you, come get tattooed! I was talking about you the other day to justin and Derek, but it was mostly them saying "man, I wish I had listened to Syrian and gotten into bitcoin when it was 50$" haha
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:37:04
I work at No Egrets tattoo in Clarksville, Tennessee. For the time being I'll do 10% off for BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:09:50
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:26:17
this seems like a really cool model to get street artists paid for their labor by those who enjoy it. nice.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:59:04
ah, I see. I work at No Egrets, not No Regrets. We have much Regret always, just no egrets
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:42:57
Do it. I could use a new wallpaper. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:36:52
Always open for these kinda of things, PM me with details. I'm fine working up some custom frames if you like.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:24:52
this is straight up the most future headline i've read in my life.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:19:39
where are you located?
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:38:17
Lol no this is for a sticker print so I have a way to have a snazzy looking QR. Nothing permanent, yet .
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:21:43
oh my god this is so slick.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:59:53
Maybe I'll draw up some stripper/hooker/sexy time QR frames. I like the way you think.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:44:25
THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!! YOU'RE NOT A CHILD PORNOGRAPHER ARE YOU!?
