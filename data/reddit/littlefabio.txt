Same. I'm mostly just annoyed because not I have to wait and can't actually use it
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:15:17
Yeah guess I need to wait for it to go up lol oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:13:52
KILL THEM.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:45
I'm just annoyed because I bought .043 for gambling and now I am fucking loseing money without even having it cause I don't Bank transfers. Fuck man.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:53:54
I bought .11 at 400 and now it's 500. Don't get returns like that anywhere else as an amateur like me. Going to reinvest in altcoins
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:31:36
You fool. Absolute fool.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:19:55
Like three weeks
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:41:13
I'm slowly exchanging to LTC
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:51:31
I honestly don't know because circumstances are changing​ so much. Maybe start with a single 1070 when prices drop, bit and antminer is a big jump imo
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:23:37
There was a time that all alts plummeted?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:35:18
1CtidpnJsvWmQqRvXLJzMY9nSL1vnRRyv4 let's get through all this conflict together and realize that's we are all in this because of something bigger than all of us, something affecting everyone on Earth while they don't even realize it. Fiat value is decreasing while crypto is increasing!  What a trade.
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:45:20
It might be gone forever.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:04:02
Just came through, thanks!  Please donate more next time though.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:35:36
Literally don't
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:07:20
If you are on this subreddit you know to buy a fucking hardware wallet. Don't feel bad at all.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:45:19
Buy a bit each week.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:59:10
I just don't get how this currency works if everyone holds or sells and never spends
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:58:30
Just bought 12 coins!  Hope the overdraft fees get paid for by my profits!
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:49:02
It sucks cause I heard about Bitcoin so long ago but I just ignored it. Would've paid for my college and more. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:32:18
Hahaha guess we can see
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:57:25
That made it easy to understand, thanks for explaining it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:07:42
I love it. The threat gets the gears moving!
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:30:39
Will this whole controversy affect alt coins?
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:29:11
So halvening is good cause it increases the value of current bitcoins out there?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:36:32
Nobody should have to worry about this if they didn't spend more than they have to lose. This dip is more entertaining than anything
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:43:33
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:01:32
What's the ETA on these updates?
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:43:32
So with USAF, will this change help lower transaction fees ?  As a miner I'm still trying to understand the situation
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:09:36
What similar wallet would you suggest?
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:59:52
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:33
SELL SELL SELL NOW HURRY SELL IVE SOLD EVERYTHING THIS IS THE END.
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:14:52
Have you ever seen an altcoin act how ETH is currently?
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:32:51
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:24:10
Same, not sure how to avoid exchanges completely
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:00:31
I definitely agree, but doesn't this just make everyone want to hold and not spend because it will eventually rise in value?
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:50:43
Where do you purchase your Bitcoin from?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:57:39
4000 that quick?  Ehh
