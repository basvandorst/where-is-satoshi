Alex Jones never incited violence or hate. He is just bringing news from reliable sources. That idiots start to make death threats is not his fault, everyone is reponsible for their own actions. It goes the other way too, CNN is actively trying to ban people ( a dodgy move from a newssite, sounds more like a fascist regime ) and the supporters of CNN are sending death threats too. On both sites you have idiots.
Months or even more than ayear before it became mainstream news that facebook was spying on people Infowars already reported on this. He is not making things up.
CNN, CBS are actively infiltrating subreddits tog et them banned because they have different political views, they are getting people banned from youtube, facebook, twitter. Alex Jones is the latest victim of this. That is the America you shouldn't want. It starts with people you don't like and you are fine with it. Next step is the rest. This IS censorship. Not by the government, but by big media platforms who are trying to get people banned.
Edit: when newssites start to campaign against other news sources ( CNN was one of the companies that wanted to get infowars banned from youtube &amp; twitter, amongst buzzfeed and others, they are no longer a neutral news source. They are showing their political allegiance and they are making news instead of just reporting it. It's a slippery slope.
