"Circle’s website is plainly advertising for careers. I question their lack of need for a marketing team with some new ideas."
Circle has ten open positions listed and two are for marketing roles. I'm not sure how that translates to a "lack of need for a marketing team."

What do you mean by tracking and compliance service? You think that some service is sending your 0.0001 in order to track your movements? Why would they need to send you funds to do that? Sounds like paranoia to me.
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:39:42
"They were likely from a new tracking and compliance company." Huh?
Also, companies like Circle (and Coinbase, Paypal, Venmo, Square, etc.) would get in trouble if they knowingly allowed gambling proceeds transactions. You can thank the U.S. government and their desire for "safe ports" for that.  (
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:27:08
Sounds like you're expecting these companies to act like geopolitical educational non-profits. There's no way that expending those type of resources and money would be beneficial to any of the companies you named given the current climate in Greece.
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:09:35
Its potentially dangerous and you're violating federal and likely state law. Other than that, good luck!
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:00:16
LBC could be licensed and then everyone would be covered... But it would take them a couple years and a million bucks to do it and they'd never be able to comply with the level of AML review, etc. Not to mention a lot of the people that like to use their service would stop using it if they did real KYC/AML review.
@_date: 2014-10-06 18:13:29
What did Circle Support say when you contacted them?
@_date: 2014-10-10 14:03:32
I believe its also on Comcast On Demand.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:44:58
Ahhhh, this is the issue. Sending and receiving bitcoin to and from bitcoin wallets takes from a few seconds to 40 minutes (for final confirmation). Bank Account transfers can take 3-5 BUSINESS days.
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:08:59
I had prior knowledge from reading Support articles and Terms of Service. I'm assuming what you're getting at is whether the average person might have the expectation that it works more like FDIC insurance or credit card protection where they are protected even if they are the ones that screw up. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:44:29
Right now receiving your entire salary in bitcoin isn't really practical unless you're just doing it for show and instant converting a significant portion back to fiat currency immediately.
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:27:33
Keep your BTC in Circle and test your own wallet with some nominal amounts. Once you're confident that you know what you're doing, then you can decide if you prefer to hold your own keys or benefit for Circle's insurance, etc.
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:54:53
The good news is that not many people holding bitcoin are tax saavy enough to deal with all this.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:58:47
The video on weusecoins is pretty good: 
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:39:51
You can link a credit card to your Circle account and withdraw to it. 2.9% processing fee. Can't use a prepaid card though.
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:28:15
Well, we still don't know if this is user error or not. Hopefully OP (or AskCircle) updates us once they figure it out.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:09:42
Do you understand how temporary verification deposits work? They didn't just gift you ~$0.50 or whatever. They deposit it so that you can confirm your account and then they withdraw it. This is how every single bank or other company that uses test deposits handles things.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:57:35
If you're going to sell in large amounts your best bet is to create an account on an exchange like Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-10-10 14:06:19
Registering with FinCEN is super easy, so no real excuse for a U.S. company to not do it.
@_date: 2014-12-05 15:59:52
I think the fact that there is no spread between buy and sell prices makes a huge difference in this regard. If Circle said no fees but had a lower price when you wanted to sell them bitcoin, I'd agree.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:02:06
Future solutions will surely focus on NFC and Bluetooth, not cell data.
@_date: 2014-10-05 03:32:30
Circle is your best bet. Now that they're open for general sign up, give em a shot.
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:35:24
Team is great, investors are great, website is dog shit.
The fact that they still rely on wire transfers for deposits is embarrassing.
@_date: 2014-10-09 14:33:09
Plenty of other people have had the opposite (transactions canceled at higher price and able to attempt when price dipped). Obviously stinks to have a transaction canceled but if they started honoring old exchange rates for canceled transactions it would open them up to all sorts of gaming of the system.
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:54:32
I think the fact that you posted this and then responded with "so nobody has has (sic) this issue apparently..." after less than 30 minutes demonstrates your lack of patience and ability to gauge what appropriate response time is.
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:45:54
If you give them Facebook and Twitter access, you get like a whole $0.03 more.
@_date: 2014-11-16 15:09:18
They run through flagged or suspicious transactions to see if they are credit card fraud.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:23:15
How do you plan to afford the $1m+ regulatory costs of federal and state licensure? Have you raised outside investment money?
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:50:02
No. I would be SHOCKED if they went for any more than current bitstamp price.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:50:32
This is in fact how Circle does it.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:44:16
FYI - Sending your photo ID over email probably isn't the best idea. If you reach out to support via their weekday phone/chat support, they can give you a link to a secure upload page. Not a huge deal, but better safe that sorry. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 04:15:41
The title is inaccurate.
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:22:30
Right, but you legally owe that money to Circle. So unless you want to deal with the complications and consequences of not delivering payment for something you purchased, you should contact Circle support to resolve it.
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:06:13
yeah, kind of a pain to have to exit the app to get the code and then get back into the app. Still prefer the safety, but curious if there is a better way to integrate that.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:59:53
You might want to update your graphics, that was their homepage in like 2013, but they have a new logo and everything.
@_date: 2014-10-28 11:41:58
Circle doesn't have a spread. Buy and sell price are the same.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:56:46
"With Walmart on their board"
Huh? Do you mean former Walmart board members on their board? That's like saying "with Facebook on their board" because one of their directors used to be on the Board of Facebook or "with Fox on their board" because they share a director.
@_date: 2014-10-02 03:59:39
It already doesn't work because Circle charges 2.9% processing fee for card transactions. On deposits and withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:33:57
When will they make this available for streaming vs. Limited showings?
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:54:30
I think you missed the joke...

Just deposited from my bank account and sent funds. Working fine for me.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:36:24
The short answer is no. It's theoretically possible but infinitely improbable.
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:53:55
Nobody on this subreddit is familiar with easing your way into something. 
Companies like Coinbase are great to dip your toe in the water and figure out what bitcoin is all about. Then, when you are ready and comfortable, you can move your coins to a wallet that lets you hold the private keys.  And if you never get to that point, that's okay too.
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:11:08
It's MIT. I bet they get 90% participation.
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:25:15
You never go full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:59:50
I suggest you compare Circle's privacy policy to any number of others ones out there. I think you'll see that its actually fairly restricted and customer favorable.  Addressing your bolded parts, I"m not really sure where the big issue is?
"we may collect geographical location data"
**Allaire demoed the not yet released mobile apps. One of the optional features was to display a google maps style integration on payment confirmations. Might not be everyone's cup of tea, but was a cool feature for sure.**
"your name, address, phone, email and other similar information"
**If you want to link a bank account, they need your name. If you want to use 2FA through SMS, they need your phone number. If you want to get confirmations on sends and interact with support, they need your e-mail.**
"(such as a date of birth or partial social security number)"
**If you want to deposit from a bank account or credit card, they need this for fraud protection (same as any other company). They don't require this information until you link an account. You can use your Circle account for BTC storage and payments without ever providing this.**
"We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification services."
**Collecting your info doesn't do them much good unless they can compare it to some repository.**
"we collect information about your transactions and your other activities on our website"
**Do you not want a record of your transaction history? If you change a setting to display currency in Yen, do you not want them to be able to remember that preference the next time you log in?**
"additional information about you through your interactions with our support team."
**If you e-mail/call/chat support, don't provide them any information you don't want them to have.**
"You are free to decline our cookies if your browser or browser add-on permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website."
**Again, you can refuse to use cookies, but then you'd have to manually change display and other settings every time you log in.**
"We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve and personalize the Services, as well as our content and advertising."
**This is simply data aggregation for improvement purposes. "Users from Europe encounter 20% more deposit errors, so let's fix X or improve Y."**
"Law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when: We are compelled to do so by a subpoena..."
**Do you expect them to not comply with court orders?**
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:58:03
This is the correct answer. Has nothing to do with database limits and everything to do with the fact that people trying to link several cards are more likely to be trying to commit fraud. (Not saying you are, just that is the fraud flag)
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:46:09
"Nearly end of business day now."  It's not even 10am on the east coast.  Circle is located in the U.S. and it sounds like you sent stuff in after their workday ended and expected them to process it overnight?
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:33:24
If you are artificially inflating the price with big purchases the price will drop once you stop buying and there are no other whale purchasers there to take your place.
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:17:37
I mean, I know you didn't actually report Circle to BBB, your bank or local authorities, but its absurd to say you did.
Circle owes you nothing.
If they are too slow or ask for too much for your liking, then go elsewhere. I'm sure Circle won't shed a tear over losing you as a customer.
@_date: 2014-11-04 02:59:13
Why aren't you offering services in NY? Seems like everyone has a free pass in NY until the BitLicense is implemented.

Yeah, screw saving your marriage, you missed out on a potential rise in bitcoin value!

None. A random one here or there might sneak through, but that's the extreme exception.
@_date: 2014-09-30 20:23:20
You do realize that Circle's investors and directors are among the most well respected and funded in the entire industry, right?  Do you really think they would jeopardize billion dollar VC funds and personal net worths to abscond with a few million in customer balances?  This isn't some kickstarter where the person can say "sorry, the game isn't coming out, bye." 
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:58:09
And what is the "real price" of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:32:14
Prepaid cards don't work on Circle.
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:11:42
I believe Circle responded in another thread that they stopped asking for stuff via e-mail and now have a secure upload channel.
@_date: 2014-10-02 12:35:23
They obviously already have some seeing as they've already demoed their iOS app and said it would be out this year.
@_date: 2014-10-03 03:41:28
Yes, yes I do. If I was that afraid of 0.000000001% chance events, I'd be forced to live in a bubble.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:02:02
So how did Coinbase get their test deposits back?
@_date: 2014-11-04 01:35:38
But since the buy/sell price is the same (unlike Coinbase) there isn't any spread for them. You can sell them BTC at the same price they sell them to you at.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:58:45
They approached the person that currently owned it and offered them $X for it?
@_date: 2014-10-02 16:10:39
Circle has e-mail support and online chat support as well.
@_date: 2014-11-13 21:42:37
Circle lets you sign up when you're 13, but you can't link a bank account or credit card unless you're 18.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:39:28
They responded to a review in the Google Play Store that it was a root detection issue and would be removed in the next release.
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:57:17
Even once it comes out of your account it can take a couple days for that to get communicated back to Circle.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:23:33
Is it held in someone else's name or something?
@_date: 2014-10-07 19:36:23
I've never done it, but I believe that you can import your Google Authenticator codes to Authy on your end, even if its not an option in Circle's settings. Really like the push notifications from Authy.
@_date: 2014-10-03 13:34:49
A company that is operating on the scale of a Circle or a Coinbase isn't going to cause buy issues because the price has dropped. The value to them of a seamless experience and attracting more users is much greater than HODLing a few more coins that they purchased high. Hopefully once each of them have raised another $100m each people might stop accusing them of conspiracy theories like this.
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:33:32
Love all these comments. You know they're only reading like 20 of these submitted by the biggest bitcoin players. Tops.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:52:29
I've made some deposits using a Liberty Teller ATM and the price was better than using Circle with credit card, but worse than using Circle with ACH. One deposit of $50 straight to my Circle account netted me ~$49.50 according to Circle, so 50 cents worse than if I did a Circle ACH transfer.
Other ATMs charge a lot more.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:02:28
Why would someone deposit with you and pay all these fees rather than use a free service like Circle?
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:35:12
What if I think there is X% chance it goes to $0 and 100-X% chance it goes to $1,000,000?
@_date: 2014-11-18 16:18:57
Yeah, if you think that Circle's buy price includes "hidden" fees by being higher than other sites, then by the same logic they are paying you a premium when you sell to Circle because its the same buy/sell price.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:04:36
Funny that you messed up. Sad that you live with your uncle. Impressed that you know (kinda) how to set up a miner.
@_date: 2014-12-04 04:00:20
I still don't see how this company is anything more than allowing people an avenue to commit credit card fraud and circumvent AML and money transmitter regulations. Not hating on it, just won't be surprised if they catch a ton of heat.
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:06:57
So by your estimation they lost less than one tenth of one percent of the money they have raised from investors to fraud losses? Oh no! Downward spiral!
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:30:24
It cleared your bank over the weekend?
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:14:58
All of them.
My guess is that Circle will win consumers, Coinbase will do well with consumers and win merchants and Xapo will win Latin/Central/South America.
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:00:14
That's not accurate. Lawsky has specifically said there would be no enforcement actions against bitcoin companies until the BitLicense is finalized and implemented.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:37:54
So you'd prefer Circle asks for everyone's personal information as opposed to just those people they need it from?
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:17:24
"Assessment of your account activity" is code for "you tripped one of our fraud detectors and we weren't able to manually confirm/deny in time to process your transaction."
If they were actively reviewing transactions and finding a reason to cancel them, then you'd be getting suspended or a request for photo ID, utility bill, etc....not just a notice of cancellation.
@_date: 2014-10-03 16:39:22
Ahh, that makes more sense. I thought it was a double deposit.  Obviously annoying, but I'm sure they'll sort this out.
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:49:17
And by "the WORST" do you mean the same as every other ACH transfer in the world?
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:46:22
Xapo 2.0!
Oh, you still can only deposit funds by sending a wire transfer to Slovenia.
No thanks.
PS - Love that their homepage image still shows 1 BTC = $863.07

Students had to sign up to receive the $100. I think his question is more to how many MIT students actually followed through and got their $100.
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:26:49
I would be SHOCKED if a solid mobile app/wallet wasn't heavily in development at this point.
@_date: 2014-10-06 14:32:10
There are "instant access" limits that are lower than deposit limits. So you might be able to deposit $2,500, but only get instant access to $500 of that (not sure of exact limits).
@_date: 2014-12-29 11:47:21
If you're the type of person that doesn't want fiat values displayed at all, Circle is a terrible fit for you and vice versa.
I'm sure CSV export functionality will be added soon due to tax deadlines approaching. Still going to be a pain in the ass to deal with.
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:11:36
You can enable PIN access in settings. If your phone also has a log-in password then they'd have to know your phone password and your Circle PIN to do anything. If you really want to get nuts you can Authy as your 2FA and enable PIN access on that too.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:40:14
That wasn't a yes or no question, but thanks for trying.
@_date: 2014-12-04 15:55:29
I would expect that if there was a rogue employee or hacking/phishing attempt that targeted Coinbase/Circle directly and my btc was stolen, they'd file a claim with the insurance provider and put the btc back in my account within a reasonable time frame. If there is a hacking/phishing attempt directed at me or my password/2FA is compromised because I wasn't careful enough, it wouldn't be covered by any insurance.
@_date: 2015-05-14 13:17:12
Because these companies are all heavily regulated and backed by VC funds that wouldn't risk the wrath of regulators.
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:01:58
So you contacted tech support because your friend couldn't transfer funds? Sounds likely.
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:16:49

Its been clear since the beginning that the comments would be public.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:47:41
40 minutes is the maximum confirmation time for BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS. Not deposits from bank or credit cards.
@_date: 2015-05-29 02:56:27
That's the point.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:59:38
Why bother when other companies offer zero fee BTC transfers?
@_date: 2014-12-01 11:07:41
So your alternative to instant BTC from a slick mobile app is to spend several months ingratiating myself to some people at bitcoin meetups in the hope they sell to me without a crazy markup?

@_date: 2015-01-26 16:32:15
Anyone who thinks they are cherry picking transactions to cancel based on price movement needs to take off their tinfoil hat.
I'm sure just as many get canceled when the price drops, you just don't hear anyone complain about that.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:02:13
NYDFS has said that companies won't be punished for activities conducted prior to effectiveness of the new regulations. So Coinbase likely had a pre-clearance meeting with them, confirmed their activities would be regulated and that they'd be able to comply, and moved forward without any risk.
@_date: 2015-01-31 16:02:15
Interesting to see public comments in support of their application from BitPay and Circle - 
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:40:49
Selling BTC on Coinbase is completely fine. Unless you've acquired those BTC from LocalBitcoins or some other unauthorized money transmission service (or other illegal activity). They might not like that because it leads to regulatory/compliance issues for them.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:27:45
Oh okay, you're right. Didn't realize you were more of a trading platform.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:02:53
Because Coinbase/Circle don't let you launder stolen gift cards.
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:52:21
You'll probably have to submit some photo ID and other related information to prove your identity. Might take a few times reaching out to Coinbase customer support though.
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:18:58
Yeah, it's hard to get. The piece that this subreddit doesn't seem to get is that just because only NY has a BitLicense, it isn't the only state where bitcoin is regulated. A majority of states view bitcoin activity as falling under existing laws and requiring a license. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 03:07:59
Did you even read the article or just the headline? A moat is forcing any new company to go through a 3 year process getting licensed in fifty different states. A streamlined federal fintech charter process would make it easier for new competitors to emerge.
@_date: 2017-01-04 01:24:58

Sounds like you linked a bank account which takes up to 4 business days to make it from your bank to Circle (slow ACH system). If you had instead made a deposit using a debit card (which is also free) the funds would have been available immediately.
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:05:44
If you have BTC in Circle you can still send BTC using Circle. Only buy/sell is turned off.
@_date: 2016-11-26 23:49:44
Circle pays your fee.
@_date: 2016-12-11 01:39:57
Seems pretty much on par with the level of maturity I expect around here.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:37:58
Max, what about states other than NY that regulate money transmission and include Bitcoin activity under those laws? How do you operate in those states? (For example, Coinbase is licensed in like 20+ states).
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:53:24
Why would someone downvote this? Its one thing to take the personal viewpoint that the laws are tyrannical or whatever, but people should at least go in with their eyes open knowing that unregulated things like Local BTC could lead to trouble.

Right, but presumably if it's a slider you could set to 10/90, then 35/65 the next day, then 50/50 the next day, etc. And those movements would be taxable.
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:17:24
If you know how to mine, you're probably saavy enough to handle something like Mycelium. Otherwise just keep it in Circle or move to Coinbase. Just test out both websites/apps  and see which you like better.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:07:40
Yeah, if you want to do anything shady, then don't use companies like Coinbase and Circle that are obligated to close your account if you're doing shady stuff.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:08:11
Then it sounds like Circle or Coinbase is your best bet. Easiest options for quick conversion to USD by withdrawing to your bank account.

If you actually read the UA, that restriction has nothing to do with arbitrage or trading and everything to do with Circle not being allowed to support unlicensed money transmission. The language could be clearer.
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:23:26
Stronger incentive, but not a strong skill set.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:31:38
The only reason you'd send to someone on Coinbase was if they wanted BTC, so in that context it would make sense to denominate the transfer in BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:46:51
You can send to other Circle users with their email address instead of a BTC address. This lets the "To:" field auto-populate with your stored contacts.
@_date: 2015-04-14 13:29:44
Why not use Authy or Google Authenticator?
@_date: 2015-09-14 20:37:13
First, make sure you've gone into your settings and linked a checking account. Next, click the "cash out" button and you can sell your BTC to Circle and have the $USD transferred to your linked bank account.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:32:22
If the price is "outrageously" high, then buy elsewhere and sell on Circle. The buy/sell price on Circle is the same.
@_date: 2015-04-07 01:29:32
More people hate on Coinbase because more people have used Coinbase. Some people prefer one over the other, but for acquisition of bitcoin, many use both. Sign up for a Circle account and see which one you like better.
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:29:04
People here are just desperate for the price to go up. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 21:31:00
Coinbase doesn't get your funds for a few days until the ACH clears (and they fulfill your deposit) and they aren't earning any interest on the BTC, so this doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:34:02
How dare they take the same amount of time to process an ACH transaction as every other company on the planet!
(Also, Circle can increase your instant limits once you build a solid transaction history.)
@_date: 2015-04-11 15:39:57
How do you know that 20 other companies aren't also engaged in discussions and further along towards being regulated?
You can't say "first" without knowing the full picture (which you can't possibly know).
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:37:10
Coinbase and Circle don't force you to buy big amounts. You can buy $5 worth. However, Circle or Coinbase (or any other regulated company) will probably block you from creating an account if you are from Iran due to government regulations and sanctions. Even if you do manage to sign up for an account, it will likely get shut down in short order.
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:53:40
I think people greatly overestimate the number of "shills" that are on reddit supporting some of these companies.  There is a huge difference between a "shill" (which implies that its a Circle employee, paid poster, etc.) and someone who just has developed a preference/liking of a specific company and then maybe goes a little over the top in hating on the competitors.  It'd be like going into a sports sub and calling Yankees fans shills for hating on the Red Sox. They're not shills, they just have a strong preference that gives rise to them hating on the "team" they don't support.
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:46:40


I don't think you understand how that works.
@_date: 2015-03-27 20:55:25
Circle, Coinbase and any other big company will shut down your account if you're using it to gamble, buy illegal goods, etc.
@_date: 2015-03-19 11:15:28
The fact that you allegedly run a company and think that any of those companies is currently profitable is the only info I need to know a shouldn't invest. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 04:08:53
Seems like a lot of work, what do you need the btc for?
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:14:17
If you're buying counterfeit stuff, that's still illegal and something they wouldn't let you do if they knew.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:26:03
Why do you want to buy large amounts with a credit card?
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:46:23
It's amazing that outside the allegedly privacy-minded bitcoin world, I've NEVER heard of someone sharing their bank login details with anyone but a spouse.
Why couldn't you just login on your own?
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:46:56
If you got a verification code and you weren't attempting to log into your account - someone else probably was. I'd change my passwords ASAP.
@_date: 2015-02-28 01:47:57
Skeptical at the level of upvotes of everyone of your comments in this thread.
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:01:50
There's no way a stealth company is raising more than Coinbase has.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:32:57
100% agree. Just think the issue is trolling and hyperbole, not shilling.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:53:15
This is just dumb. Circle doesn't require any of this.
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:21:01
Circle is the only company with a BitLicense currently, and you can buy and sell BTC through Circle. Other companies (like Coinbase, etc.) have apparently applied for a BitLicense so they are able to operate until their BitLicense is approved.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:07:26
You mean you don't want your interactions with them governed by mandatory arbitration in Hong Kong?
"You and Xapo further agree: (a) to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration; (b) that any arbitration will occur in Hong Kong; (c) that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Arbitration Ordinance 2011 of Hong Kong; and (d) that the courts in Hong Kong have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration."
You mean you don't like their liability limited to $100 with no carveout for direct loss of your account balance?
"In no event will the aggregate liability of Xapo, our licensors, service providers, or subcontractors for any loss or damage that arises out of, or is connected with, any of the occurrences described above exceed, the greater of $100 or the service fees that you paid to us for the service we provide through the Services during the month during which the incident occurred."
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:51:14
The thing that people don't realize is that these services like Coinbase are trying to operate at scale. You can't possibly expect some person at Coinbase to spend an hour analyzing individual state statutes to see if the "research chemical" you are buying is technically legal under the specific state and federal statutes that apply to you. You're buying some powder to get high. They could spend an hour analyzing your specific grey area purchase or they could use that same amount of time helping 20 legitimate customers.
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:52:53
If you're spending bitcoin at a conversion rate than you acquired it at, then you're still recognizing a taxable gain. So anything you're doing is just masking taxable profits, not actually avoiding them.  
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:56:20
Coinbase is not insolvent. They are backed by multi-billion dollar investment funds that would not ruin their reputation over something like this. They may have very well fucked up their ETH/ETC system, but insolvency shouldn't be a real concern for this sort of VC-backed company.
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:54:00
Weekends are the easiest time for large holders to manipulate the markets because its more difficult for people to move in and out of exchanges due to legacy banking systems being less responsive.
@_date: 2015-02-14 19:42:17
Haha, this is beyond stupid. Yeah, Circle decided to manipulate the upvotes on a random post that includes a screenshot of a Circle balance without including the Circle name, logo or any reference at all as opposed to one of the pro-Circle posts.
