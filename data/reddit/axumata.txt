I'm from Kiev and I want to tell you one thing.
The protesters are heavily supported by very rich and powerful people. At least the «legal» part. It's an open secret that all of the «revolutionary» media is controlled by them.
If a protester begs for financial support now, he probably belongs to the «illegal» part of them. Those who don't want to put their weapons away despite the «legal» part of the protesters are in power now. These are aggressive, redneck-ish people armed with bats, poles and guns, who roam around Kiev and destroy the property of those who they consider «enemies of the Ukraine».
Please, do not feed that flame. It is very, very dangerous.

The problem is that nobody would hear the bellringing.
Average Russian knows pretty much nothing about Bitcoin, reddit, and even the entire English-speaking segment of the internet.
Meanwhile every bitcoin-related media in Russian targets moneymakers and technically literate people. Nothing exists to cover the gap between them and average Russians who are losing value of their savings. Damn, even Blockchain's russian translation is awful.
Same shit happens now in Ukraine. Oh wait — it's even worse because in Russia you can still buy USD for RUB at banks or exchanges, and in Ukraine you can't even do that.
If people would put their devaluating savings in Bitcoin, it would be a good thing. Even if Bitcoin crashes dramatically, at least they've could say that they gave it a try.

That's wrong. I fully acknowledge that Trump can be bad in a number of ways. 
I dismiss all the negative news about Trump because he may be as bad as he wants to, as long as he addresses the issues that matter for me the most. There is a chance he won't deliver, of course, but his opponents throw these issues in the trash right away.
Also I'm fed up with them. Quora.com sent me over 100 digests during this election cycle, every one of which contained on average 3 negative, often loaded questions about Trump, like «Is Trump's campaign over?». Not a single positive thing. If this isn't propaganda, I don't know what is.

Real-world use cases of Bitcoin I have either witnessed in person or used myself:
* Store of value
* Sending money overseas to avoid tremendous hassle with Banks (e.g. We're a BANK, we cannot do this and that!)
* *Receiving* money overseas to avoid tremendous hassle with payment processors (e.g. We're NOT a BANK, we cannot do this and that!)
* Purchasing legal goods and services online
* Purchasing illegal goods and services in the darknet (drugs)
* Distributing profit between shareholders to avoid contact with banks
So, you can be a legitimate hodler (e.g. «I have some coins for some reason») or a degenerate hodler (e.g. «I got in at 18k and I'm clenching my butt so hard I have to reinforce my beliefs constantly by telling everyone about that»). This has absolutely zero effect on users as Bitcoin has some legit, real-world uses not associated with short-term monetary gain and not done to "help the cause", but to pursue real-world benefits that Bitcoin provides.

"Somewhere in the terms of service" is not exactly loud and clear. For example, on Kraken, I'm required to pass KYC even before I can deposit fiat. But requiring to pass KYC during the transaction (especially requiring a photo of a credit card between your buttcheeks or something) is a lot different than that. It may screw you over in a situation where you need that transaction executed right away.
