Central authority issued coins - with public key printed, but private key stored in the banks (just like gold parity USD used to have).

Sorry but I believe taxes are a bad thing, so is the goverment.

I think I'll just make a new post in favor toshi :)

I think that the whole Athene crew is just a bunch of social activists :( They won't fully endorse bitcoin because for them it's just another form of greedy capitalism. Funny thing is that he even admit that he "doesn't have a lot of economical insight".

I'm not from US either. I'd like to cash out (at least 50%), but it'd be probably too late anyway - so I guess I would just keep it like a souvenir after all.

Seriously, how is this possible that Josh is not yet in prison?

Thanks!!! You are my hero! :D

I agree :) He is kinda Internet star. I love his "best paladin of the world" video.

it's just some kids

What does that have to do with anything? The problem is that 74.1% want him go and there is not even a public announcement or anything - like it didn't happend at all.

I've just found the related thread on bitcointalk:  the wallet is also on GitHub:  
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:22:10
Well, that was kinda rude :P Got a better idea?

@_date: 2013-11-25 00:19:58
I guess it's from the Internet Headquarters

Are you guys working on the official app for Windows Phone? That'd be really exciting to see! I used to have Android phone and the app was amazing!

Invest 50% now no matter what the price is and the remaining 50% in a few weeks/months (if the price plummets in the meanwhile then just use it to buy more). Also, never keep your money on the exchange and learn how to secure your wallet.

Many comments regarding blocked links. May I ask which country are you from? Who is blocking this?
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:46:25
you mean 100 kilosatoshis :)

Do I "contribute" to the bitcoin network anyhow by running full node (local blockchain) or by running a miner? What's the difference? What's the "purpose" of a full node? And what's the "purpose" of a miner? If we want to keep the network fully decentralized, would it more important to use a PC to run a full node or a miner?

Still not convinced. Similar thing could be said about TV: "Government will never allow Internet as they would loose control over TV".

Not very familiar with Wikipedia editing policies, but it looks like the change was done 2 days ago (on November 21st) by user "Chrisarnesen". There were many edits later on from different users but the infobox is still not there. So "They" seems kinda accurate in this context.
