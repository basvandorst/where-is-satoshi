A deja vu is usually a glitch in	 the Blockchain... it happens when they change something.

I've been cashed out since it was announced that BFLs were shipping. I'm waiting a bit for things to even out.

In order to avoid the possibility of chargeback, I'll sell you 1 BTC for 1.25 BTC, sent to my wallet address.
Oh, wait.

I use campbx. They offer dwolla deposit and withdrawal, but I've been going with bitinstant&gt;wallet the past few days.

I sent $500 from my CO360 account yesterday morning before bitfloor made any announcement. It was then picked up.
Just more drama in the world of bitcoin, I suppose.

Are you saying I can dodge bubbles?
No, isworthanupvote. I am saying that when you are ready, you won't have to.

Oh, don't worry. I give it 20 minutes before we see &lt;$105 again.

Trust me, I dislike government as much as the next anarcho-capitalist. I'm merely proposing a system to make existing democratic systems less likely to be controlled by someone other than the actual voters.
And regardless of whether you like your rights being subject to others' votes, they are. Not reading my post won't change that.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:42:03
How, exactly?
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:37:26
1+ minute lag on Gox.
Dis gon be gud.

I've been advocating removal of representative democracy for ages now, as it just plain doesn't work. Direct democracy's where it's at, but unfortunately it won't catch on without massive amounts of support, as there will be direct opposition from government on all levels.
One can dream, though.

It's cool, I just tossed 1000 USD in at 260/BTC.
God dammit.

And then when somebody is unable to vote due to their wallet already having been used, everyone will know it due to the transparency of the blockchain. Everyone will also know where it occurred for further investigation.
And yeah, I know it's not perfect, but it's no doubt a step up from what we have.

Are you saying that a vote could be traced back to the person that cast it?
If so, that's not necessarily true. In fact, the system would be designed for anonymity right from the start. I know that I initially said "to generate a 'wallet' and private key for each voter based on some sort of personal identifiable information, such as SSN", but I simply meant that there would be some way to perhaps take a hash of the personal information in order to generate an anonymous wallet address from it. Like any hash function, it would be a many-to-one function of the personal data, and wouldn't be able to be traced back easily.
In fact, I'd even say that the visibility of all the votes to the public is one of the BENEFITS of this system. Currently there is no way to know what happens between the time that you cast your vote and the time that your vote is counted. This way, every vote is counted immediately, and everyone knows about it. The blockchain ensures the election's accuracy, and somebody would point it out if something changed.

My idea was that upon wallet generation and association with a voter (again, specifics on this aren't developed yet), the appropriate number of satoshis would be automatically generated by the system. There would be no human interaction. Upon the completion of voting, any votes left unused would be removed from the voter's wallet, and the wallet, which was generated from voter information, would be added to a list of wallets that have voted in this election, and cannot be voted from again.
The basic idea is that the actual wallet ID and keys are obfuscated by the system. You can't transfer votes from one wallet to another if you don't have the private keys, and those are purposefully kept out of human hands... somehow.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:46:21
Why what?
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:11:23
Because if I'm going to live in a statist system, I'd prefer that I have some control over that system.
My ideal paradigm is voluntaryism, but that's unlikely to happen for some time. In the mean time, we should make do with what we have and attempt to preserve our own rights by making our voices heard. In the current system, there's no way to be sure that one's vote actually counts, and corruption is rampant. Why not introduce just a little bit of transparency in order to provide peace of mind and ensure that your vote isn't being thrown in the trash as soon as you leave the polling place?
But again, as I said, "How Bitcoin Can Save Democracy" was for those that enjoyed dramatic, sensationalist titles.

If voter IDs were faked, then the attacker would then need to have physical access to a voting machine at the polling station that the voter would be voting in. I would personally design the system to disallow transactions from outside of a VPN consisting of only voting machines, but there are several other security measures that could be put in place against remote transactions.
As for modification of the client allowing unauthorized votes, I'd assume that the system would work the same way as the Bitcoin implementation of the blockchain does, which simply ignores anything that doesn't check out.

I bought back in at 117 the other day with around $1k. Just cashed out $690 to wait for the storm to pass.
