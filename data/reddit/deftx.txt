It's a start. An ugly, difficult one at that.

It's in its infancy. I get irked when people try to act like it's identical to USD. It's not. It'll take a while before people trust it enough for large transactions and long term contracts. For now, it's a useful tool for merchants to reduce credit card usage (and fees), investors to speculate, and ATI for all of the revenue they're getting from mining :)

The change in supply &amp; demand will drive the price down. 
The huge amount of supply vs the number of buyers will make it worth less. Demand will increase inversely to the drop in price. Look @ the market depth for bids @ 22.00$. A lot of people are willing to buy @ 22.00$.

I will be deploying a service soon that will accomplish this.
Users will be able to deposit BTC and earn a fixed rate of return based on a defined term, such as 2 weeks to one month. I already have mining resources, but this stands to create more. 
Shares will also be sold of rigs for long term rewards. This cost a bit more upfront, but provide payout over months. The risk is a bit higher, but the rewards are potentially greater.
More details soon. PM me if you care to know more.

It's almost like BitCoin doesn't have nearly the value of other currencies and a small player like MtGox can shift the value of the market hugely.
This kind of thinking during bad times is dangerous.

Speculation is a necessary driver of all markets. Speculators are the risk takers that, if successful, can help make Bitcoin worth more. 
The role of speculators is vital in economics. For example, futures markets help stabilize volatility overall and provide liquidity. 
Speculation is the economic grease that helps drive markets. I highly recommend reading up more.

Assuming it is a bubble. You don't know if it is a bubble until its over. :)

Well, the bids at 22 don't necessarily mean that the price will be driven to there. It simply could be a large number of hoarders that are hoping to make a quick buck. 
Mt Gox's only makes up 14% or so of transactions in BTC. However, I believe that many use MtGox as a barometer of BTC-&gt;USD simply because they're the biggest exchange. They have a lot of control over the value potentially, and could choose (against their own best interest, likely), to artificially manipulate the price.

So, basically, you have an uneconomical mining rig that's less uneconomical now? :P

It's insane that people trusted them and willingly transacted on there by their own will.

Perhaps this kind of transparency turns everyone into a wanna-be detective when things aren't going well, causing them to point fingers at people that likely have no idea what you're talking about.
Money moves around all the time. Because it moved around during the Gox crash doesn't mean much, unless you have hard external evidence to prove it. Why don't you do this kind of thing when things are rosy, hm?

They really ought to separate their API from their main site. The JSON requests alone from 3rd party sites are likely taking up a huge amount of resources.

Aside from the Trollnomics, there isn't a place you can run a short on a BTC index yet.

By whom?

If anyone complains about losing money, it's their own fault for investing in the first place. You had the resources to make yourself aware of the early adopters' total BTC.
