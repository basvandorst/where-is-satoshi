Hi Pineapple, here you will find a 2-minute institutional video about the project I´ve just applied for funding at your website. It will give you a better idea what we are trying to achieve. In any case, thanks a bunch.

and a couple grammar lessons, when you´re at it.

 This is not quite correct though. It is not as you can hop on a bus and pay with btc. Actually, a local crypto company (Bitex) allows people to top-up the SUBE card (a contactless card used to pay for your bus/train/subway tickets in several cities nationwide) using bitcoin.
Anyways, in Argentina you may manage all your personal economy with bitcoin, albeit indirectly, thanks to this sort of interfaces between the crypto world and daily life. [Bitex.la]( is one of the local spearheads in this effort, btw.

Hard to say. There are quite a few blockchain startups and local advocate groups, as well as an estimated ca. 200,000 btc holders/users. However, mainstream press reports are mostly focused on negative issues (volatility, price drop, Quadriga, etc.). 
As elsewhere, though, the real pump will begin when corporations start using btc for export/import transactions.

Yep, thought the same thing. Seems like Brazil, isn´t it? Saludos.

You can pay your bills using btc through a handful of crypto portals (Bitex is one of them, [SatoshiTango.com.ar]( is another one). You can top up a prepaid mobile phone line, and you can get a bitcoin-prepaid credit card for all the other stuff as well. I don´t know at which price they take your btc, so I´m not sure if it is more economical than the traditional payment methods, but if you want to bitcoinize your life, you can.

Why print it? Just handwrite the seed and put it in a safe. If the idea is to airgap access, do it the old fashioned, low-tech way.
