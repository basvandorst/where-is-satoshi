Well agreed it wouldn't happen in Bitcoin, but if it did the rollback chain would just be sold off to very low or zero market cap. A tiny chain surviving wouldn't hurt anything. The ETC/ETH situation is the only thing saving Ethereum right now. If they had to all go with ETH the platform would be dead in the water.

As someone who believes we should have much bigger blocks right now and is very upset that Core wants to keep delaying the direct blocksize increase, let me say that it's still easy for Bitcoin to 10x without any additional scaling at all. This is because Bitcoin is mostly used for getting around laws, and those users don't care much about fees, probably until they get well over a dollar. That would be disastrous compared to what might have been, but it would still allow for a massive price increase and adoption increase before it would become a clear and present bottleneck.

Splits are a wonderful solution to a community divide, especially since ledger copying doesn't lead to dilution of hodler purchasing power. Just gotta protect against replay attacks and 51% attacks, and make sure wallet software and exchanges are ready.
EDIT: An ill-conceived minority chain fork is a great benefit to the majority, because they can sell all their coins in the errant fork. If say 30% fork away in a useless fork, you stand to increase your BTC holdings by up to 30% for free. It is a beautiful system where any foolishness in the community of hodlers just serves to make the smart people wealthier. Minority forks should be welcomed. (In fact, errant majority forks are even better: ETC holders have made out like bandits so far on the errant ETH majority fork.)  
Contrast this with altcoins, where the leavers make BTC holders poorer.

Dash and Factom are heavily premined so their real effective market caps are smaller than Monero. Monero is legitimately mined, but it itself has a tiny cap so even a small price dip in Bitcoin, if moved into Monero, would multiply its price several times.

The fork to undo TheDAO was a terrible idea, but the split into ETH/ETC has been great. The split was Ethereum's saving grace, avoiding the all-eggs-in-one-basket effect of everyone going with Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation. 
A split is a good thing if the community is truly divided. The only question is whether we are truly divided (as Ethereum was due to being young and a fast pump with little history of pain so had a bunch of naive investors who knew nothing about why they were even using a blockchain or what basic functionality Ethereum should even offer). If not, a split is pointless but probably fairly innocuous as one side will just slough off and die while hodlers stay whole. If we are truly divided, a split will be a boon to hodlers.

They can't let some people withdraw without letting everyone withdraw, and presumably they cannot do that because they don't have all the money. If they don't have all the money, all their company assets will have to be liquidated and the payout will happen in bankruptsy (months/years later). At least as I understand the law. I can't see how else it could realistically work, unless they actually do have enough money to pay everyone back.

Traders (ones that make a lot of money at least) smooth volatility and create scarcity or plenty when it is needed to ration resources effectively by predicting the future accurately. Traders can save lives be ensuring stable food supplies, for example. Bad traders do the opposite, but they quickly lose all their money and their ability to affect markets, while good forecasters are continually given more power to do more good by making trades based on correct forecasts. 
Traders and investors in general are as important as farmers, doctors, homebuilders, etc. - if not more - to the continued survival of civilization. If they all disappeared, millions of people would likely die as the market's ability to rationally allocate resources through time would suffer a major blow. 
Bad traders are worthy of scorn, I agree. But they will usually soon be broke. In this highly immature market, though, there are some cases where they get lucky and thrive for a while. As more people enter the market and it gets more sophisticated with futures and such, the maturation should improve the outcomes.

People aren't used to this kind of "rich" debate because they haven't ever really seen it. Rich debate looks messy at first, but as people realize that it's no longer a game of how much one-sided propaganda you can spew (because constant airing of all views means misrepresentation of the opposition will soon backfire since it leaves an easy opening), it slowly but surely gels into a coherent and nuanced set of positions. 
Sure there is some backsliding and noise mixed in because this isn't mainstream media with its controlled narrative, but look at the general trend. The subtleties in positions of even amateur onlookers that have emerged from the recent multi-month debate are quite remarkable when you step back.

The graphic is quite misleading. Many vendors sell on multiple markets, and the bars in the chart aren't accounting for duplicates, so if you look you can see that the bars mainly get smaller when a particular market shuts down. The actual amount of commerce is almost surely growing feverishly in both number of purchases and their average size, from all other indicators. Also there seems to be a trend of vendors going "off market" once they amass a set of buyers, to save on fees.

This is an illusion. Open source forking is all the power decentralization that is needed. Trying to overlay consensus redundantly over that consensus system just creates gridlock. Whether it's absolute consensus within each fork, where any one Core dev can veto everything, or democracy where the majority of Core devs (chosen how??) are required for every decision, this creates an unacceptable amount of gridlock at this time, when altcoin still nip at Bitcoin's heels. 
One day when Bitcoin has taken over the world, we'll be able to afford the luxury of a more conservative governance structure. For now, the order of the day is to learn to embrace hard forks, and let the threat of forking be what stays the hands of those with foolish proposals.

Ethics or law? Universality wouldn't be desirable in law even if it were clearly definable. Should the same contract law apply to a consumer taking out a warranty on his TV as to large corporations concluding a contracting agreement? Should noise pollution rules apply equally to an urban resident and a single person living on his own private island? Should a 7-year-old kid in a wheelchair who takes a swing at you be punished the same as a K1 boxer if they both miss? 
The purpose of law is to avoid violence. There are centuries of nuanced customary legal precedents, varying somewhat from place to place and culture to culture, that have evolved to serve that purpose. 
As for ethically invalid institutions, is the family one of these? It must be from that standpoint, because parents and children do not have equal rights in a family. The ethics are not universal. Now you can say that children are an exception because of such and such a reason, but then that justification complicates the one-sentence view of ethics. And then the can of worms is opened: if age can make a difference, someone will say why not intelligence, wealth, gender, skin color, position in society, tradition, a magic scepter. Universality in ethics isn't libertarianism, but rather a squishy word game that can ultimately be manipulated to serve any end.

There should be less contention in an emergency. As Gmax said somewhere, "Consensus for a change is easy if the system is otherwise broken!" Even though there'd be options, Schelling consensus would coalesce quickly as people compromise because they have to. They would simply converge on the emerging consensus, as soon as any option so much as hinted that it might pull ahead. 
It's clear that emergency is consensus-positive, and I think highly so. However, Gmax's position is self-contradictory, because if it really only takes a few days to hard fork in a fix, what danger is there really to trying a larger cap? After all, it can just be hotfixed "in a few days" if there are problems(!).

1MB is a magic number? Insofar as you think we need a blocksize limit, the goal - in the face of competition from altcoins - is to find the most optimal size. Stray too far from the optimal size, in either direction, and an altcoin can take market share. Is 1MB the optimal size? That would be incredibly serendipitous, considering it was just intended as a temporary measure.
Note: I don't think we need a hardcoded blocksize cap at all, but if you think we do, the above certainly applies.

I don't think that's true. Anyone can always refuse their upgrades. Automating the devs out of the process would be nice, but there is no better decision mechanism than forking, so it should be used whenever an important decision needs to be made. Anything else gets messy and allows for possible domineering behavior that is hard to stop without - you guessed it - another hard fork. May as well embrace the forking process.

Bitcoin is all about the niche use cases. Sending money outside the country isn't that niche anyway, is it? I don't think Bitcoin is THE solution for Greece, at least not yet given that we don't know what other controls they will implement, but there are certainly uses for it that come to the fore in situations like this. 
The most non-niche use would be if the government instituted a tax on cash holdings, by forcing everyone to trade in their euros notes for new devalued ones and banning euro notes and gold. Depending on the viciousness of the enforcement, Bitcoin could be wellnigh the only way to protect your wealth.

* If they adopt Bitcoin whole-hog, great. 
* If they create their own version with monetary policy added but maintaining uncensorable transactions, capital control evasion, etc. that would be a mixed bag but it would keep Bitcoin the top dog as far as wealth preservation.
* If they take away all the things that make Bitcoin subversive, then they get Applepay and Bitcoin retains its entire unique value proposition.
So basically the more they try to modify it, the less it affects Bitcoin at all, and the more they keep it the same (though they definitely won't do this), the less it matters that we have Bitcoin in the first place.

Here the author finally gets to the crux of the argument, and it's just a confused handwave. Sure, the 75% cutoff might have some issues, but the big crescendo toward the crux of the argument was all about why consensus is needed for any hard fork. That's what the whole article was tacitly promising to provide along the way, and instead we get this limp-dicked switcheroo where the author tries to refocus our attention to Gavin's specific proposal of this time. 
The argument for why consensus is not needed has been spelled out many times already: yes, there is a game theoretic incentive to align with the majority, but if that ever becomes too painful, you can try forking off. If (and only if) there was a legitimate and substantial  economic benefit to your fork over the majority one, it will survive and perhaps thrive. And in the event that the majority was completely mistaken, you win even bigger by forking off. There is no losing scenario for those who ascertain the situation correctly (or even those who remain neutral and wait), except if you think the split is inherently risky. It may be, but if so the resources should be directed toward fixing that, because forks are the best form of governance available - a truly voluntary democracy - and if they can't work we have a big problem no matter what.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:25:54
If there is a fee market, there will be. That's the argument of the 1MB crew, after all. Since eventually we reach a limit of how big the blocksize can practically be, we have full blocks then, and that means network usage will not go up much because of spam since it will be too expensive. In that case it is only increased adoption that can drive up network usage, and that means more full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:27:26
Do you understand what an altcoin is? It's a fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin can fork any way (in fact every which way) and people will use the fork to which user consensus converges; it can't fail "due to blocksize," whatever you mean by that.

And create so many more. People will just want different things done. Used to be we were all engaged in satisfying the lowest level of the hierarchy of needs: food, clothing, shelter, safety. Then we got richer and moved up to satisfying other needs, thanks mostly to automation, now even minor amusement we will pay good money for: just for a massage or someone to help explain something or someone to fix some very minor problem we have. More and more marginal amusement and convenience and removal of the last general bits of suckitude from life. Those are the jobs of the future, and they pay well because by definition there are a ton of rich people (what else would you call people that want for almost nothing but the least critical little trifles being removed?).
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:29:27
Fees should be based on supply and demand, which cannot happen with a hard cap unless the cap is high enough not to be effectively capping anything. It is completely obvious that we need a fee market, and it's painful to see people arguing against that, but the hardcoded blocksize limit needs to disappear as well. 
Both are economic distortions that need to be deep-sixed, but they haven't yet simply because there has been little harm because of them, since the tx volume is still so low for it to really matter. These kinds of tests will bring us close to seeing some kind of breakage at times, maybe, and if so the necessary changes will be made.

The characterization of "giving users the choice rather than making it for them" is bizarre. 
If one claims that users signed up for a Bitcoin where blocks were limited to 1MB, someone else can claim that users signed up for a Bitcoin where the blocksize cap was kept well above the typical transaction level. Leaving in the 1MB hard cap with extension blocks is no more "giving users a choice" than increasing the hard cap. You're tacitly assuming the social contract is "1MB cap" rather than "cap well above typical blocksizes." Since that is completely indeterminate and open to interpretation, it cuts the ground from underneath the user choice argument. Since your "choice" assumes people originally signed up for the 1MB cap in perpetuity.

As you've probably noticed, you have to emphasize and quantify the words "low priority" when saying they take a day to get confirmed, otherwise people will freak out.

If paying a 15-cent fee is all it takes to avoid being low priority, no one except microtx buffs will care.

Nodes are people, with volition. If full nodes were getting low and there became doubts about what to trust on the network, more people would start running them. People don't run full nodes, because they don't need to because there are enough nodes to trust that the network is not being messed with. If the need arose, it seems almost tautological that people would start to run their own. Kind of like if there weren't a bunch of eyes on the software, and some bad stuff got through, people would start looking through the source code themselves to make sure it's legit. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:09:16
The argument that it would result in centralization, rather than just some kind of ill-defined "decrease in decentralization," is based on extrapolation of node count with obvious confounding factors like the rise of SPV clients. 
Looking at the actual motivations of people running full nodes suggests the opposite: that more tx capacity will grow adoption and increase the number of people motivated to do so, and that that will far outweigh the number of people currently running nodes for whom it becomes prohibitive due to resource requirements, provided the increase is not too large.

It's impossible to raise the blocksize high enough to handle all adoption scenarios on block capacity alone; optimizations are absolutely needed, whether that's IBLT, LN, sidechains, hub and spoke, centralized services for micropayments, or other minor tweaks. To keep going with this Bitcoin thing means to keep carefully weighing tradeoffs.
A blocksize cap increase is definitely going to be needed, but it shouldn't be the *first* resort for scaling.

One of the more mindblowing uses of prediction markets is that you can create and transact in what are essentially shares in a company without the company's approval. You just create a continuous bet on the current price of the stock, say GOOG, then your shares will tend to track that price, and buying those quasi-shares will push up GOOG as well - if the prediction market is big enough - because of arbitrage. If more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares is on the prediction market, for example, you can cause a major selloff without owning any shares, just by placing prediction market bets. 
A big enough prediction market would overwhelm Wall Street.

I have a hard time believing that databases didn't already have some kind of consensus system. How would banks operate without that?

Though I agree it would be a pointless fiasco that might set progress back a year or so and should be avoided, it wouldn't be the end of Bitcoin by any means. It would take MUCH more than that to kill Bitcoin. The store of value function, which is still Bitcoin's main use, would remain intact. The value would fall, but the ledger would remain unmarred, and after a year or two the value would be back because the problems would have long since been fixed. Investors can just yawn and sit tight waiting for their multiyear investment to pay off.

It doesn't fail; it's just that it's only part of the solution. We can get at least something like Moore's law type grow from the blocksize cap increases, so we should, even though a fee market and other solutions will have a much greater effect toward increasing effective blockspace. The question is whether we should increase the cap now or later. I think one increase now for a few multiples higher is a good idea to see what the effects are (can big blocks really be exploited to mess with small miners?), then if the effects are purely benign we can use blocksize scaling as quite a large portion of the scalability picture. If the effects are scary and seem hard to fix, we can buckle down and focus on other solutions exclusively. It's not either-or.

Exactly, hot wallets weren't available so much back then, which seems to throw a flaming javelin into the heart of the "bigger blocks are destroying the node count" litany, because for most people the difference between waiting 3 hours and waiting a day is nothing compared to the difference between waiting 3 seconds and 3 hours.

It's clearly an issue that needed some intensive debate. I don't see anything being wasted, rather a great deal of clarity (at least steps toward clarity) has been gained and many thoughtful proposals and methods of analysis have arisen. 
As far as actual decisions, though, it's a lot simpler than the song and dance of far-in-advance debate makes it appear. Once a crisis hits or is imminent, changes will happen *much* more readily, whatever the governance structure of Core. (And even if it requires a fork to XT or whatever.) That isn't to say the governance structure for Core can't be improved, but that the lead time here is grossly magnifying the apparent contention.

A fee market is the *only* thing that can dynamically deal with a sudden increase in userbase. Even with 1 TB blocks, without a price system for allocation of scarce resources the only other option is ad hoc spam protection measures where we somehow have to judge based on certain non-economic criteria what constitutes an "objectively" low-priority transactions. With a fee market, priority is determined by how much the sender is willing to pay, and yet the amount required for the average user to pay is minimized since people do not make transactions frivolously. Just like any free market.

But the limit hasn't actually really capped anything until recently. The first tangible evidence of a major step in adoption being hindered by the blocksize and the opposition will shrink to a fifth what it is. 
But more than that, almost every dev is for some level of increase. The main arguments are that it is klunky to just raise that cap without first letting other optimizations get full play. That "first" has had little motivation to come into play because every time we hit the soft limits they were soon raised.

The killer app right now is evasion of various kinds of control.

I think I just discovered why full nodes have fallen, besides SPV wallets. It's because Bitcoin used to be small-time, and you wouldn't want to trust BC.i or anyone else. Now it's clear that any oddities would be scooped up on the various news aggregators with great speed, and in general Bitcoin feels a lot a more established, so - in combination with the resource usage, yes - most people of course don't see much point in running a full node. But this is self-limiting because there will always be those people who demand knowing firsthand and that need to have the guaranteed trustlessness for their business or use-case.

To be clear, everyone is for bigger blocks in the long run.


I think a lot more devs would support a smaller increase, or at least they could go along with it. 
Buying time is not necessarily what we need, more like buying motivation. Some things don't change until the need is urgent.


There's no "stuck." Crisis creates easy consensus. Probably a major investor turning down Bitcoin to build on Dogecoin because they need more TPS would change some core dev's minds, but this hasn't happened yet.
Also, if TPS capacity is what you're worried about, keeping in mind everyone is for a blocksize increase eventually anyway, think about the difference between (a) 20x-ing the TPS capacity by moving to 20MB blocks and (b) 20x-ing the *non-frivolous* TPS capacity by having fee markets form thereby pricing frivolous transactions out of the market. Of course we don't know how many transactions are really frivolous, but given that many of them are free it makes sense that the commons is being vastly overused for unimportant transactions. Is it 100x? 10x? Who knows, but I hope it's clear that this is much more elegant and efficient way to scale TPS for now. 
Once we start feeling like fees are getting too high, we'll have to consider the tradeoff of bigger blocks and lower fees versus smaller blocks and higher fees. We can make a calculation that is then half market-based, rather than shooting in the dark by expanding the tragedy of the commons rather than eliminating it.

Bitcoin has always been volatile, there's no possible way to tell if this debate is affecting anything.

@_date: 2015-06-01 10:10:29
If we start hearing about companies being skeptical about using Bitcoin because of the capacity AND somehow this changes with a mere 20x capacity, then we're talking a clear and present issue. 
The bottom line is we can raise it quickly if it's urgent. The 1MB limit is not going to hold back adoption. If anything, the careful debate gives confidence to corporations that every measure is taken to ensure nothing breaks.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:31:03
If we don't expect to reach 20MB for a long time, a smaller increase to, say, 8MB makes more sense since consensus should actually be *easier* to reach afterward, provided that increase doesn't cause problems (and if it does, of course 20MB would have been a worse mistake). Not only will fears of the hardliners be allayed, but the precedent for forking will have been set and the experience will teach us if there's anything we need to watch out for in the forking process. 
This cuts the ground from underneath the whole motivation for making one big jump "so that we don't have to deal with this again for a long time." A modest increase seems to me the more clever/cunning approach, kind of like the sales technique of a YES ladder.

If the fork were successful, it would likely price-positive since the underlying issue would have been addressed and consensus would have been achieved. 
If unsuccessful, it depends on the fallout. If the fallout is handled well, like it was on March 11/12, 2013, the price could also rise like it did then because it shows Bitcoin can handle a crisis. If the fallout were handled poorly, it would likely be price-negative.

Shorting couldn't net you enough to pay for all that mining revenue you'd be losing. And if you failed because anyone squealed or added mining capacity when you pulled your pool offline in anticipation of a 51% you'd be bankrupted...and the squealer would make bank. Very very hard to pull off, and markets are not deep and liquid enough to get enough out of a short. When they are that deep, Bitcoin will be a lot bigger and the lost opportunity cost of the mining will be that much huger.

You only need a tiny portion of people actually using it for non-hoarding purposes, and that's more as a proof of concept (proof of actual transactional need) than anything.

Your language is confused. Hardforks are trivial to deploy. Perhaps you mean successfully getting everyone to switch to a new fork with a contentious change is difficult. Well yes. But...


..."should be"? Well, they are. It's no harder and no easier than getting enough of a consensus to reach critical mass. If there is major stalwart contention then you can't get consensus, regardless of what should or shouldn't happen.
Only in the case where the stragglers will absolutely refuse to come along will there be an actual persistent fork where Bitcoin splits into two. That would be neither good nor bad; it would simply be necessary, as explained. 
A persistent fork won't happen in this (blocksize issue) case, because there is not enough pressure. If enough of the anti-increase folks absolutely refuse to come along for even a modest increase, the pro-increase folks will put it aside until actual pain from small blocks starts being felt. At that time, we'll have a flowering of ideas (as we are already seeing, way in advance...imagine how much it will be in a crisis) and either these will cure the problem acceptably enough to delay the fork, or they will fail and prove to the stalwarts that an increase really is the way to go and it will no longer be meaningfully contentious. 
At this point, I would say - despite appearances - not enough people care either way. There has to be actual or at least imminent pain for that, not just future what-if's.

The thing is, the only reason the exchange needs sole control over your coins is so that you can get all the benefits of instant trades on markets like people are used to. However, many people just want to make a trade once in a while, or simply want to buy BTC or sell it, and they don't care about fast execution. For that, it seems like it you could set up a multisig scheme that prevents the site owner or hacker from taking your coins. Order matching would be very clunky, but it seems workable. They basically serve to find you a counterparty who wants 10 BTC, for example.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:03:38
Even back to summer 2013, when Bitcoin was in the news but only as a one-off thing because of the price rise. The fact that the price is roughly the same as it was then is astounding and suggests the price has a lot of catching up to do.

None of the core devs are for keeping 1MB forever, nor if that limit were causing persistently severe issues. Also, just because something wasn't intended for a given purpose doesn't mean it can't turnout to be necessary for that purpose (although it looks suspiciously like a sacred cow, that doesn't mean it is). 
But most of all, a precedent for breaking consensus among the core devs is not something to take lightly. If 20MB is too controversial, make it 4MB or something, and leave the 20MB fork in the wings for an emergency. I don't buy the whole "it will become harder and harder to fork later so we need a huge jump now," because consensus magically aligns during such crisis situations, as we've seen. No one wants to be on the side of broken.

The claim is that the reason that decision was made by higher-ups or whoever is that full nodes had become annoying to run.

Gmax keeps making this claim; I'd like to see some numbers to back it up. A graph of this full node decrease, annotated with dates when recommendations changed, size of the download at different times, release of popular SPV wallets, etc.

Everything is going much better than expected, pretty much as well as it could have, unless you care that the price is still down (which is good for people who haven't bought in yet, so that's sort of a wash).
The blocksize debate shows how much thought will be marshalled toward consideration of all options, as well as innovative solutions that optimize any aspect of Bitcoin that even looks like it entails some kind of trade-off. Contrary to popular fear, no devs can stonewall Bitcoin or drive it in a direction holders are generally against.

It's a pretty dumb way to approach the debate, but most people don't see past their narrow short-term argumentative objectives.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:57:14
My argument is why not do it in smaller increments? The tacit assumption behind a big jump to 20MB is that it's easier to do it all at once. But if you have to totally destroy consensus with all the existing core devs to do that, suddenly the situation has changed and the idea that it's easier looks silly. 
Also, think of what would happen if we went to 4MB and there were no problems and no increase in centralization, or if here was but it was very mild. Then most likely everyone would be on board with an increase to 20MB or maybe higher.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:34:53
We suddenly up the cap. Gavin seems to think it needs a lot of planning. Other devs don't seem to (especially if it's a small increase). Perhaps that's where the real disagreement lies. 
If we had an easy forking mechanism this wouldn't even be an issue, we'd just hotfix on the fly in case mainstream adoption came knocking.

It doesn't change the fact that the future technical capabilities are more likely to increase than plateau. Once can even make a stronger point: tech is more likely to increase dramatically (on the order of Moore's Law, etc.) than to increase modestly. 
With altcoin's nipping at Bitcoin's heels, missing to the downside is almost as bad as missing to the upside. If the game is to set the blocksize limit as close as possible to what would be optimal for actual future network capacity, assuming a conservative reading of Moore's Law, etc. is going to be far more accurate than assuming "no significant improvement."
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:37:42
Bitcoin is a carefully balanced system of tradeoffs. It's impossible to raise the blocksize high enough to handle all adoption scenarios on block capacity alone; optimizations are absolutely needed, whether that's IBLT, LN, sidechains, hub and spoke, centralized services for micropayments, or other minor tweaks. To keep going with this Bitcoin thing means to keep carefully weighing tradeoffs.
A blocksize cap increase is definitely going to be needed, but it shouldn't be the *first* resort for scaling.

I don't worry too much about regulation at this point, because I think no matter what short-term measures are taken, in the end Bitcoin is either going to provide a net compelling proposition to key factions within major governments, like the Internet has, or it won't. If it does, as with the Internet, they will lay off it until it's too late to stop, even if there are some early misguided strictures. If it doesn't provide a net compelling proposition to any key factions in major governments, they will restrict it and it will fall on other governments to be Bitcoin havens and make every other state envious of their economic advancement to the point where they revise their decisions.
The reason I think Bitcoin will win is simple: it cycles the [OODA loop]( faster than governments possibly can. It's like the Internet on roids. There is simply no way they can keep up, and they will lose out on all that juicy tax revenue until they realize it. Once they get a taste, they won't be able to resist. Plus of course there's [this](
In short, regulatory arbitrage, [inter-state anarchy]( disintegration of incentives within governments and among people due to secret investment, and running OODA faster than anything else.

It's also not all right to tell people, "Probably storage won't be better in the future, so you shouldn't worry about competition from altcoins that scale up planning for that."

This doesn't change the fact that if you want to have high confidence of getting into the next block, you pay a high fee. Sure, you can't be 100% certain a whole bunch of people won't suddenly decide to outbid you and push you to the next block, but you can generally be pretty sure. And with a sufficiently high fee, you can be practically 100% sure. 
If you trim down your point, it does have some merit in the sense that the uncertainty about what other clients will choose next is an inefficiency and will cause people with extreme priority preference to pay more than otherwise necessary in an effort to lower the uncertainty. However, again given blocktime variance this doesn't seem huge at all.

There is no management, though.

If either Core or XT decided to change the coin issuance schedule so that there would be 42 million coins instead of 21 million, for example, the community would simply leave them off, refusing to upgrade to their aberrant fork. The management privileges are the most tender kind, as easily revoked just as the current speaker given the floor in a group conversation, maintaining their fragile position solely at the pleasure of Bitcoin stakeholders.

We change blocksize almost every ~10 minutes. What we haven't changed is the blocksize cap, which so far hasn't actually been capping anything since miners have been self-limiting the size of blocks they create. I actually think they will always do so, even without a hardcoded cap. It's just that a lot of core devs disagree, or at least worry that that it may not turn out that way, and since keeping consensus is important there's good reason to talk about these alternatives/compromises.

@_date: 2015-06-04 05:25:36
Gavin is for removing the cap entirely. If we worry about adoption spikes and transaction surges, ultimately we either need a miner to be able to make a huge block *right now* if necessary or we need a way for fees to rise gracefully with users kept in constant awareness of what they'll have to pay to get priority confirmation. 
I think the ultimate solution is no hard cap (meaning only an economic cap) + transparent fee pricing that miners dynamically adjust and is instantly relayed to clients. Then everything is in the price system and regulated by incentives.
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:30:00
Too conservative. It's not as if the global economy is just going to switch to Bitcoin and keep chugging along as usual. That defies the whole premise that Bitcoin is a huge improvement. If it is adopted on the basis of it being a huge improvement, enabling amazing efficiency gains and all manner of new business and new people entering the economy, then it must massively increase the global pie. That makes something like $100 million per coin the true end result of total WWL integration.

Why can't fee pressure already work? Each mining pool can just post their current estimated fees they would accept in a feed and let wallets access it and use it to give an estimate to the user on how big a fee to attach if they want to have a &gt;90% confidence of getting their tx in the next block. I don't see how anything else is necessary. 
It seems to me that so far it's just that miners haven't cared about fees much, since there is so little use of the blockchain for high-priority transactions, meaning low total amounts of fees. No matter how you slice it, it seems we have to have a lot more users before we get fee pressure at 1MB.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:02:09
Great thread. Notice how many points have "how many?" rather than "what percentage?" In many cases, absolute numbers are more important for decentralization than topology or percentages. If we can get more people using and holding Bitcoin, even if the *percentage* of some measure goes down, it may be eclipsed by the absolute number rising. Full nodes being the obvious example.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:13:10
Well that escalated quickly. We're all reliant on the market anyway, and that fundamentally precludes the possibility of certainty about what effect a change (or even doing nothing) will have. 
If I were to bet, I would say removing the cap entirely would actually be fine and miners would self-limit due to economic constraints (30-50 years hence is way too far to fret about, IMO), but I would *not* choose to do this because I think retaining consensus is paramount, and that maintaining consensus is not that hard as long as changes are gradual and only happen when we are forced into them by urgent needs.

Yeah, there is no way to know where the limit should be without a bit of crisis. Bitcoin is fundamentally a censorship router-arounder. It's a solution to a bunch of problems and an evader of a bunch of attackers and controls. As we scale up we will see what kinds of snags it encounters, and the antifragility will try to route around them. In many cases we cannot know where to set the dial in terms of tradeoffs without encountering adversity. 
Honey badger needs to stick her nose in the beehive, constantly pushing the envelope. If not, she'll stagnate.
First off I think we should wait for some clear and present trouble with the 1MB cap, preferably with a fee market in place so that that trouble would be limited to gradually rising fee prices. When the kitchen gets too hot, we'll likely have consensus for at least a modest immediate increase. Then we can see what the effects are, and whether we like the tradeoffs and how severe they turn out to be.
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:12:53
You're right that deliberately limiting Bitcoin is no way to go. Maybe it can't scale up to the entire world's transactions, but if Bitcoin doesn't maximize the scaling some altcoin will. Competition limits how conservative Bitcoin can afford to be.
@_date: 2015-06-10 00:56:37
It will just force rationality. Most likely an increase in fee structure by the miners. Blocksize will need to increase once there blocks full of transactions paying a very low but slightly higher fee, and should probably be increased preemptively. 
Bottom line: both fees and blocksize need to increase, though fees only slightly.

Monero is big recently here. They haven't figured out that spin-offs make it impossible for an altcoin to win (or even compete!) as the WWL against Bitcoin on its home turf. The only way for an altcoin to win as an alternative *ledger* is to market it to fresh blood, people who have never invested in Bitcoin. Any bitcoiner will always prefer the spinoff version that maintains their percentage stake of the WWL. Need to go market it as something new, unrelated to Bitcoin, not to the community here, as all you can get is a very limited "fear hedge" from bitcoiners, and that dies the moment a viable spinoff is proved as a concept (hasn't happened yet because there are no worthy coins, Monero is the best candidate but still too early to create a spinoff).

I bet there would be ways to get around that, since you can never tell who's pushing tx's if the sender uses TOR and mixes up the addresses for instance. Though some mining pool operators might just use their gut, which I suppose could work. But really, a fee market is the solution. We need a fee market no matter the case we're looking at. 
But really it's a self-solving problem either way. Bigger blocks as a first resort just means the fee market forms later, which is arguably less elegant.
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:53:54
Well it seems clear enough from parent that all such a standard-fee stress test would do is force regular users to pay a little above the standard fee.

I don't see that it's clear that running into a price wall first is better than running into a blocksize wall first. I can see some arguments for both sides, but it's not obvious. The best solution may even turn out to be a bit of both: a can-kick with a modest blocksize cap increase while we figure out what to do to streamline fee market price discovery and get practice with the hard forking process. We're already getting a lot of practice with the debate aspect of it, and because of just this debate level "pain" and the stress tests, the motivation should be there to figure fee markets out. The next wall, whether 8MB or something similar, will still be pretty low and comfortable, especially by the time we reach it as technology should have advanced significantly.

It's a myth that more full nodes are better just for the sake of having them, so there is no point in paying people to run them. The whole idea is that you have more people who *actually care* about validating. That requires giving people a reason why they must validate for themselves without trusting others, not just paying them to run them. If the node count falls too far, trusting others starts to be dangerous, so people will start running nodes themselves to be sure. 
So 1) Self-correcting problem, highly overblown. 2) Paying people off doesn't help.

It boils down to "there are other safer things to try first." I'm pro-increase, in fact I'm for removing the hard cap entirely, but I recognize that there are indeed many optimizations - most obviously in the fee market - that would create a whole lot more space as well (and long before it would add up to a meaningful increase in fees), so it is not as urgent as people thing. Leaner growth is something everyone can understand. 
I actually think the best idea is to go with Gavin's 8MB proposal, and if something breaks bring it back down. If nothing breaks we'll at least have broken the gridlock. If blocks fill up quickly, we'll know blocksize increase was too dumb a tool for the job. If blocks don't fill up quickly and nothing breaks, we'll know the skeptics were wrong and that the cap is mostly just a last resort in case of some oddness and should be kept very high above the current tx volume. 
In the meantime, we can implement all those other optimizations, though some argue that the motivation will be gone if we increase. Still, it shouldn't be all that long before we grow enough to fill the blocks, and at that juncture - knowing what we know because of the data from this increase to 8MB - we will be in a lot better position to get consensus on the right way to proceed. For example, if the blocksize did start to strain things, the motivation to do other optimizations will increase. Conversely, if the blocksize didn't change anything important even with full 8MB blocks, and then if the other optimizations prove to be dead ends, the consensus to increase the blocksize will be there. 
In short, there a bunch of self-correcting problems here in terms of consensus-gaining and testing, but they require just a bit of experimentation. Whether we do the "full blocks" experiment or the "bigger cap" experiment first may not matter much. 
In that spirit, **my proposal**: why not do a few more stress tests and if optimizations happen and clear up a lot of space then we can safely delay the increase; if stuff breaks and optimizations prove unworkable, we go ahead with a modest increase and see what we learn. Note that the stress tests will probably happen anyway in the meantime while the cap increase is in the pipeline and can still be canceled, so it could all work out beautifully.

Of course a fee market only functions when blocks are full. The point of a market is to maximize the use of all the resources available. 
The megabank pays more than the coffee buyer, so the megabank gets a guaranteed next-block confirmation whereas the coffee buyer doesn't unless they or the merchant pay a little extra. That's how resources allocate. Now if the cost goes too high for acceptably fast coffee payments, then Starbucks might switch to Dogecoin, which would suck (but realistically brick and mortar merchants are the very last places to adopt anyway).
Assuming that scenario, either Dogecoin will break because of centralization or it won't. If it doesn't, Bitcoin will increase blocksize and take that market share back. But really, it will more likely just be that the blocksize cap is raised little by little as fee pain gets high. If there are problems with centralization, we let Doge get centralized and keep Bitcoin decentralized. If not, we keep raising the cap or remove it. 
It's really not scary and there's no need or divisiveness or ultimatums, because *if it gets scary* pretty much every core dev suddenly gets on board with a modest increase. Humans adapt and change their minds.

Bitcoin is an economic tool, and it will always and forever - in any meaningful real-world economic sense - be controlled by the economic community, with the devs having the role of suggesters only.

Open source means you always can have consensus if you value it over all else. There is no actual dictatorship, except in the quite trivial sense that each maintainer is the dictator of their own fork. No one is in control. Gavin can't dictate that the coin issuance increase to 22M coins, for example. If he does, he's suddenly the dictator of an unused fork. No actual people are being controlled in any way. Everyone is free to do anything they want. The users will gravitate toward whoever is creating the most value at any given time.

The reply here was confused. OP's point rested not on the idea that they "need" funding but that they want it, and that they wish to ride Bitcoin's coattails, Ripple-style, through claims of an exaggerated relevance to Bitcoin/blockchain tech. The fact that they recently accepted a buyout doesn't in any way refute that notion. It merely shows that their marketing schtick worked. Ripple is enjoying quite a bit of marketing success as well by capitalizing on people's lack of ability to get their heads around this technological revolution.

Or the biggest pools can just collude, and not even explicitly or intentionally. They just all push the envelope because they can, and we end up with exponentially increasing cap until the cap reaches the *economic* limit. That's basically the same as having no hard limit. Way too easily gamed, even unintentionally. 
Now I'm actually for no limit at all, but retaining consensus at this point is more important, and most of the core devs are nowhere near embracing "no hard limit." (Only Gavin and Mike Hearn, possibly Jeff Garzik(??).)

This is a dangerous misrepresentation. The blocksize is not merely a technical parameter in the computer science sense; rather it has just as much or more to do with game theory, economics, and investment dynamics than with code and network issues. Are the devs of the Core client particularly qualified on those matters? Perhaps Satoshi is since he designed the incentive structure, but the other devs have simply maintained the system, not shown special insight into designing incentive structures nor in investment nor economics. 
Fortunately, it is ultimately a decision investors will make, and good investors *can* be expected to have special expertise in such things, and being good investors they will have to capital to move markets, by the logic presented here: 
@_date: 2015-06-29 13:22:08
Although you may not agree with the economic argument, many would say that these dominoes need to fall in order to rationalize the economies leveraged up on debt, and that it is far better that they fall sooner rather than later.* The idea being that not allowing the bust part of the business cycle where misallocation of capital gets recognized and rectified just delays the collapse and makes it bigger, hurting more people.
I know you probably disagree, but the point is it's hardly non-controversial to simply say that we should prop up every failure, never letting any dominoes fall. To say so conclusively requires a resolution to the larger debate over economic schools.

Look at the dark markets. People there only talk about Bitcoin when it is completely necessary to mention, and always in an off-hand way. They don't care about or believe in Bitcoin. But they all use it. Sort of like no one talks about the Internet. That is what real adoption looks like. 
If the Greeks run to Bitcoin en masse, it will look like people simply using it to send money overseas, maybe through something like Abra where they won't even know they're using Bitcoin. If they crack down on Abra then maybe people will know a little about Bitcoin, but nothing more than necessary and most won't share the interest we do here. Or, they will use it to evade whatever control they are actually faced with, whether that's border controls, cash bans, gold confiscation, hyperinflation, or whatever. They will only familiarize themselves with the minimum necessary to use it, and they won't be talking about it explicitly much. They'll just buy it like a jock buys a computer, focused completely on what they need it for, following some step-by-step instructions passed around on social media or offline word of mouth.
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:46:06
Trade offs. It may be possible to have cheap, universal decentralization, but we sure won't get there without learning to optimize. That's why I say raising the blocksize will be needed, but not as the *first* thing we resort to. Raising the blocksize way before fees have even started to rise just delays the optimization that will be necessary for your inclusive vision of the future. Especially an overlarge raise. If we're gonna raise it, it should be gradual just in case. No need to be risky.

Guess you could say he was being ... wait for it ... cryptic.
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:12:39
The point is to buy time for other optimizations to happen. However, the counterpoint is that *time* isn't what is needed for the optimizations to happen, but rather motivation, which requires full blocks and high(-ish) fees. Another counterargument to the stopgag/can-kick argument is that we're not running from a tidal wave here; we can make an emergency jump to somewhat bigger blocks if things get too dicey (and the diceyness would create the necessary consensus).
I think Gavin just going through a negotiation manual someone got him and trying out some of the different techniques. This latest one is Soviet style, or brinksmanship. No one's as unreasonable as they seem here. Consensus will be reached.

Even with 250k blocks I doubt there would be any delays if there were a proper fee market. It would just push up prices slightly during the test (though with 250k blocks the effect would be more pronounced). The question is how much fees would be pushed up. I tend to think most transactions are pretty low-priority now (because why not? they're essentially free), so a fee market should show that we have plenty of space* left. The stress tests tell us nothing as far as blocksize until we have functioning a fee market rather than "pay and pray." 
*but again it's not about space but about price. What I mean here is that there should be no issue of everyone who wants to get the important transactions through getting them through.
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:16:19
That is the argument Gmax and Luke have been making. They say there needs to be not just the time to make optimizations but the *motivation*. This means artificially restricting transactions, at least to a degree and for a time. (Note: I disagree with their assessment. I think an increasing economic cap will be set by market forces - orphan rates, etc. - and that that economic cap will be what supplies the fee pressure for those optimizations.)

You *want* ASICs. This is really funny that Ethereum is trying to make the same mistake in two different ways now. 
1) They want to use PoS, which is basically PoW except it's more roundabout so you have to wait for some attacker to surprise the network through some novel stake-grinding (opaque attack surface is *not* an advantage). Since they haven't been optimizing their stake-grinding techniques, they're left totally defenseless. 
2) They want to avoid ASICs, meaning - again - they have an opaque attack surface: the day when someone does discover how to make ASICs for their mining algo, they're left totally defenseless.
It's like they've mistaken obscuring the attack vector so much that it isn't immediately apparent to *them* as a defense. Like the kid who thinks no one can see him when he closes his eyes.

These all seem like reasons why a blocksize increase *isn't* what we need. For these issues the remedy is better market transparency for fees. Simply increasing capacity is an odd response to what is clearly a problem of prioritization and allocation of the existing resources. 
Now of course blocks will need to be increased in size, too, but that is because eventually fees will become too expensive during peak times with 1MB blocks, not because of any bottlenecks. Miners won't allow bottlenecks because they'll be charging higher and higher prices as blocks fill up, because they know they can and they want that money.
This is like using a hammer when you need a wrench. Sure, we will need a hammer later, but the present problem calls for a wrench; using a hammer just pushes the problem back.

Gradual makes a lot more sense especially since the argument is already that blocks won't be at 20MB for quite a while even if we raise the cap to 20MB. The downside is that we'd need to do an emergency increase in the case of a big uptick in usage.

Shorting couldn't net you enough to pay for all that mining revenue you'd be losing. And if you failed because anyone squealed or added mining capacity when you pulled your pool offline in anticipation of a 51% you'd be bankrupted...and the squealer would make bank. Very very hard to pull off, and markets are not deep and liquid enough to get enough out of a short. When they are that deep, Bitcoin will be a lot bigger and the lost opportunity cost of the mining will be that much huger.

Almost downvoted you, but realized  I agree: families are and should be "socialistic" in some ways, extended families a little less so, tribes less so still and you start to need a price system, and when you get to communities above a few hundred people the price system ("capitalism") should be the dominant paradigm. When talking about millions of people it is needless to say pure capitalism, though with "socialism" alive and well in those small/human-scale local familial layers.
The mistake is to try to apply socialism beyond those very small local family levels. Just as it would be to try to make all your familial interactions about exchange.

How does this silly either-or dynamic keep developing with fee markets and blocksize increases? It's quite obvious we need both, and in fact I've never heard anyone seriously argue that we don't need both (at least eventually). 
A fee market will vastly increase current effective blockspace, delaying the problem for quite a while, but it's also obvious that 1MB is going to be way too low for future adoption because eventually fees will be pointlessly high and leave room for an agile altcoin to eat market share. We need to both grow (bigger blocks) *and* do it leanly (fee market). 
It's a huge waste to throw the one side under the bus every time the other needs defending.

The only consensus in Bitcoin is Schelling consensus, roughly the idea that a critical mass of people will gravitate toward the best reasonable "good enough" idea and form consensus around whatever that turns out to be, in a manner than is dynamic for as long as it can afford to be, then becomes static and reliably solid when any do-or-die decision time comes (because such times makes consensus suddenly extremely valuable).

The moment anyone who practiced good Bitcoin anonymity measures is verifiably arrested for info obtained through the blockchain, the community will respond. Right now it's just a theoretical consideration, and since plausible deniability is the name of the game in legal protections, complete anonymity may not be needed in the real world.

It really depends on the exact nature of the capital controls. 
Consider each of these, and then combinations of these: 
- cash ban (forced digital accounts)
- border controls
- gold confiscation
- taxes on bank account holdings
- hyperinflation
Bitcoin has a lot to offer to certain people in each of these situations, and when you start combining them the effect compounds. Bitcoin has the shortcoming of being volatile, but if you're faced with border controls and need to cross a border with money, what other options is there? (Don't say Dogecoin :) )

Well that escalated quickly. We're all reliant on the market anyway, and that fundamentally precludes the possibility of certainty about what effect a change (or even doing nothing) will have. 
If I were to bet, I would say removing the cap entirely would actually be fine and miners would self-limit due to economic constraints (30-50 years hence is way too far to fret about, IMO), but I would *not* choose to do this because I think retaining consensus is paramount, and that maintaining consensus is not that hard as long as changes are gradual and only happen when we are forced into them by urgent needs.

Well even keeping Bitcoin working like it's supposed to might require (and in fact *has* required) the implementation of new features, so there's not even a clean dividing line. As far as user-facing new functionality there almost is a clean line, but not really even there as the fee market issue shows: it will likely become necessary to make the user at least dimly aware of different levels of fee-based priority of transaction processing so that they can make the decision whether they want to pay extra for the fast confirmation time they have come to expect.

Proof of work. Proof of stake and its variants seem like an attempt at security through obscurity, in the sense that they boil down to proof of work but it's not immediately clear what type of work will be required, whereas with straight proof of work everyone knows what work is required and so the ecosystem can get immediately to work on it, and the security is easy to estimate and understand.

My argument is why not do it in smaller increments? The tacit assumption behind a big jump to 20MB is that it's easier to do it all at once. But if you have to totally destroy consensus with all the existing core devs to do that, suddenly the situation has changed and the idea that it's easier looks silly. 
Also, think of what would happen if we went to 4MB and there were no problems and no increase in centralization, or if here was but it was very mild. Then most likely everyone would be on board with an increase to 20MB or maybe higher.

I agree with your main thrust that marginal/toy uses that can be performed functionally almost as well or better on other platforms are not something to optimize for, but rather we should optimize for those uses where Bitcoin serves a truly unique and valuable function. However, there is a limit to that focus. If we are too conservative and leave off such marginal/toy use cases unnecessarily, then we push away business and growth needlessly.

I actually think it'll be a combination of all of these. People will use Bitcoin for completely unimpeachable value  storage and teleportation, though it may be so user-friendly as to be unrecognizable as Bitcoin from a user perspective. Still, that 21M coin limit will not be something unknown to the kinds of people who buy gold bullion now. In that sense, the most fundamental and arguably the most important aspect of Bitcoin will remain unmasked.
So in terms of investment Bitcoin will remain as the big name, but for other things, yes, people won't even know they're using it. Investors of course have to keep in the loop on such things, just like the investors in companies like Qualcomm and Cisco have to know what infrastructure they're powering, whereas of course the average consumer has no idea.

The point is to buy time for other optimizations to happen. However, the counterpoint is that *time* isn't what is needed for the optimizations to happen, but rather motivation, which requires full blocks and high(-ish) fees. Another counterargument to the stopgag/can-kick argument is that we're not running from a tidal wave here; we can make an emergency jump to somewhat bigger blocks if things get too dicey (and the diceyness would create the necessary consensus).
I think Gavin just going through a negotiation manual someone got him and trying out some of the different techniques. This latest one is Soviet style, or brinksmanship. No one's as unreasonable as they seem here. Consensus will be reached.

Additionally mining pools publish their [fee schedule]( and adjust it in real time if they want to. Bonus points for an API that wallets can use to calculate the lowest fee likely to be accepted for the level of priority the user prefers. 
Checking an "advance" settings box could allow users detailed info about what fee will likely get into which block with what confidence interval; default settings would just have a checkbox saying "fastest transaction, current fee XX BTC" and warn users if the standard fee is likely to result in a wait above some pain threshold.

Keep in mind that one reason the debate has been so contentious is that the increase is so big. If it were just a doubling, that would be a lot easier to get consensus on. If it were a doubling during a crisis with transaction backlog or unacceptably high fees, that consensus would be even easier. 8MB is certainly easier to swallow than 20MB. 
I don't think there is a need to shy away from hard forks. They'll be necessary at certain times going forward.

Doesn't this problem solve itself as the userbase grows? The estimated max for 1MB blocks is 3TPS, which would be 1800 transactions in the average 10-minute block. If each tx pays a $0.10 fee, which doesn't seem exorbitant, that's $180 - more than half an extra bitcoin - or something like a 5% increase over the block reward after the 2016 halving, though that's assuming current prices don't rise. That seems very significant in such a low-margin business. And in a big success scenario, the fees could rise to like $50 at peak times, making the fee income very significant (though in that situation BTC price would also be higher).
It seems the problem is the very opposite to the arguments supporting larger blocks. Somewhat paradoxically, we're seeing blocks fill up sometimes because the blocks aren't full enough. To unravel the paradox, we're seeing blocks fill up with frivolous transactions because there aren't enough important transactions to fill up the blocks and generate enough fees to interest miners in doing their fees in a market-rational way.

Great idea, but there are some technical things that have to be put in place in the new fork specifically to allow that, so that for example you can't just take a pushed transaction on one blockchain and push it out to the other blockchain, too, to replicate it.

Thanks to the nature of open source with forking, user choice is always there and cannot be taken away. Wladimir could change the coin issuance schedule in Core to create 42 million coins instead of 21 million, but no one would use it. No one could be forced into it, even if it were somehow popular. The evils of central planning are avoided not by converting a single person to a panel of experts and demanding "consensus," but by the basic mechanism of open source and free choice of consensus forks. 
Yes a hardcoded "magic number" blocksize cap is still planning, which is not as good as a purely economic cap arising from market forces, but it's decentral planning, not the central planning of a Ben Bernanke.


Hm? "0" is also an auto-growth factor, and far more likely to be too little than a small auto-growth factor.




A higher limit has nothing to do with Keynesianism. Reiterating the points above, central planning *within a fork* is a given. Making it a central planning committee instead of a single central planner doesn't fundamentally change that; what does fundamentally change that is the fact that people can just fork off, so it's more accurately called "decentral planning."

As someone who supports the increase I find this part of the tweet worrying: "congestion problems." 
There should never be congestion problems in Bitcoin due to transaction load, because fees should rise at peak times to whatever point would prevent congestion. The reason they don't now is because there aren't enough *high-priority* transactions (in other words, those willing to pay significant fees) for it to be worth it for miners to rationalize their fee pricing systems. 
So paradoxically we're getting congestion at times simply because there are not enough users in general to incentivize the steps that would make transaction prioritization rational. This falls on both mining pools and wallet creators: if a user knows with some % confidence that a fee of X will get their transaction into the next block, where is the congestion problem? At worst it's an "expensive transaction" problem, which scales a lot more smoothly in case of a huge sudden increase in users.

In other words, the PM gets as close as possible to the "actual odds," meaning the actual best state of knowledge of the best predictors in the market.

Since that knowledge will never be 100% certainty even among the very best and wisest predictors, prediction markets cannot ever give 100% certainty. The upper limit on their utility is simply the best distillation of knowledge. But of course that is nothing to scoff at. In fact it is revolutionary.

Until there is a hugely divisive fork in the road, meaning quite a bit bigger than even this debate (which is so far almost entirely about hypotheticals), I think Schelling consensus dynamics and economic incentives will push people toward whatever fork looks like it will win. For instance, I would certainly go with a small blocksize cap fork if it looked like it was going to win, even though I strongly favor a larger cap, just because this debate is not *that* critical, at least not yet. That lowers the bar to simply avoiding anything in the ballpark of a 50-50 split. Moreover, a true 50-50 split (or close to it), lasting until the very last minute, suggests there really is a good reason to have two separate Bitcoins, which seems unlikely but still conceivable.

It never really was, like in the sense that they could have gotten together and decided to change Bitcoin to 22 million coins or something. People just trusted them because they made conservative and largely level-headed decisions. 
However, the 1MB limit is a strange animal because arguably keeping it is less conservative than removing it, since Bitcoin has never before run with full blocks. The 1MB cap is actually a new change, albeit a long-since scheduled one. Technically it has been in the code for a long time and is not new, but Bitcoin is more than just the code; it's the code plus the market and ecosystem of users is operates in. As adoption grows, to reductionistically focus on the code and say "nothing's changing" is to miss the big picture that *not* changing the code actually changes the whole picture more than changing it. Specifically, letting blocks fill up at 1MB changes the overall picture of how Bitcoin operates more than increasing the cap somewhat so that Bitcoin runs - as it always has - with the blocksize cap substantially above actual transaction volume. The 1MB cap is old in terms of the code, but new in that it has not been in a position to affect anything until now/soon.
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:12:58
As far as value flowing into alternative systems, the moment that starts happening in any significant way due to low blocksize cap, assuming there is no reliable way to rectify it, we get consensus for a blocksize increase in a  snap of the fingers. 
I strongly suspect the core devs are wrong about the dangers of increasing the cap, but they're not madmen who will open up other systems to take value away from Bitcoin - and even if they are, such as the Blockstream crew who we may suspect are motivated by venture capital, we can easily leave them in the dust as their true colors would have been shown and they'd have no followers within the Bitcoin community, unlike now.
You are 100% correct that artificially capping the blocksize just leaves an opening for competition (if it is too much lower than the natural economic cap, and if there is enough transaction demand to matter), but no one is in a position to maintain that artificial cap in such a situation. That is static thinking.

The necessary premise is "every user who cares to and needs to run a full node can." Most people simply don't care to or need to.

He could have simplified and shortened this article greatly with the correct understanding of money. The idea that money derives its value from being an indirect medium of exchange is broken, requiring longwinded explanations and circumlocutions to defend. Money derives its value from being memory, that is, from functioning as a ledger system. This supports the "maximalist" position all the more strongly.
Anyway, altcoins are dumb because they insist on being altledgers rather than just altprotocols, then marketing to bitcoin holders. If you're going to create an altledger you have to market it to people who don't know Bitcoin well, or else you run into the fatal objection: "If you say I should adopt your entirely new ledger because its protocol is a better Bitcoin, then a few years from now someone else will come along with something better and I'll have to upgrade again to a bran new ledger. The idea that every time the protocol needs upgrading we must clear the slate and jumpstart a whole new ledger (a new money) undermines the whole concept of money. My investment will never be safe." 
Build on Bitcoin's ledger, because it is *the* World Wide Ledger. There are three ways to upgrade without switching ledgers:
1) Upgrade the Bitcoin protocol
2) Spin offs, where you create a new protocol but keep Bitcoin's ledger so that every holder holds the same percentage of total coins in both
3) Side chains
Use them! Or go market your coin to a new population that has never heard of Bitcoin (if that is still possible).

Yeah people don't like the idea that Bitcoin is first used for seedy purposes, but I think that if it weren't being used for seedy purposes I would have to question the investment proposition. The people that really need it, use it. They don't talk about it much either. They don't try to pump it, they just use it. That to me is a hallmark that it's actually useful and needed in those communities. Most of the people in dark markets have no interest in Bitcoin as a movement, they just know it as that thing they need to get in order to participate. It's purely utilitarian, pure rubber hitting road, unlike so much of the pie-in-the-sky theoretical stuff that flies around in the community at large (though I'm not saying some of it won't stick). From there certain network effects gradually build, helping overcome the chicken-and-egg problem, if all goes according to plan. But that base of actual utility is what gives a solid backing to the whole concept. Doesn't matter where it comes from.

Of course it's a good thing. The implementation monoculture was the weakest link in Bitcoin's overall decentralization. Without a serious controversy the antifragility can't express itself to remedy that monoculture. This was just what the doctor ordered.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:02:03
If controversial hard forks are dangerous, the solution is to not make one big increase, but a bunch of smaller ones that are prepped and only sprung once the situation is urgent and consensus is easy. I don't think opinion will really calcify as much as you might thing over time; crisis is the best unifier.
As for frivolous transactions, a blocksize increase is the wrong tool. Market prices are the right one. Blocksizes should increase, too, but as a last resort rather than a first resort (because of consensus-breaking; I myself think the cap is entirely unnecessary).
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:26:53
I think part of it is that those against the cap increase know it won't actually destroy Bitcoin or its decentralization, but they would prefer a less klugey approach and beleive resorting to a brute-force block increase would set a bad precedent. So they inject FUD (that they don't really believe themselves) in with their more reasoned arguments based on the above two concerns, in hopes of avoiding that klugeyness and precedent.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:02:23

Yeah, there is no way to know where the limit should be without a bit of crisis. Bitcoin is fundamentally a censorship router-arounder. It's a solution to a bunch of problems and an evader of a bunch of attackers and controls. As we scale up we will see what kinds of snags it encounters, and the antifragility will try to route around them. In many cases we cannot know where to set the dial in terms of tradeoffs without encountering adversity. 
Honey badger needs to stick her nose in the beehive, constantly pushing the envelope. If not, she'll stagnate.
First off I think we should wait for some clear and present trouble with the 1MB cap, preferably with a fee market in place so that that trouble would be limited to gradually rising fee prices. When the kitchen gets too hot, we'll likely have consensus for at least a modest immediate increase. Then we can see what the effects are, and whether we like the tradeoffs and how severe they turn out to be.

It's called negotiating. None of the people are as entrenched as they often appear. For example, Maxwell said a series of 50% increases would be acceptable. Wuille is merely skeptical, but does support an increase. And as far as I can tell, that's the worst of it. Really I haven't found anyone super-opposed except Maxwell, and he's not totally opposed to a raise but he is intent on counseling caution. 
These are guys who focus on optimizations (Wuille basically said he did almost all the optimization over the past year), so it makes sense that they'd feel it especially klunky to just raise the cap when they've been doing so much with so little for so long.

No one is for 1MB blocks, especially not in a mainstream adoption scenario. It's just that a fee market is what you need for transaction prioritization, not merely a bigger commons. You need to remove the commons altogether by incorporating it into the price system. Then you can expand that blocksize and have it mean something.

Well, anyone who doesn't understand the open source process and the nature of forkability doesn't really understand Bitcoin. Those who do get to take the free money of those like grandparent who panic and sell their stash because the squabbling looks scary because they're thinking of it like a democratic referendum of a government or something. It's not like that. No one can mess things up for everyone else. No one can stop Bitcoin from being all it can be. They can just force the rational people to fork off the dead weight. The reason there is arguing is that it would be really nice to maintain consensus, but it is by no means a prerequisite.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:20:57


Not achieving consensus may be exactly what we needed. More implementations make for a more robust ecosystem. Learning how to hardfork in a safe, orderly, market-driven way makes for a robust voting mechanism. Gaining a clearer picture of how "governance" actually works makes Bitcoin easier to predict, which should make investors more comfortable.

@_date: 2015-06-01 07:46:06
Trade offs. It may be possible to have cheap, universal decentralization, but we sure won't get there without learning to optimize. That's why I say raising the blocksize will be needed, but not as the *first* thing we resort to. Raising the blocksize way before fees have even started to rise just delays the optimization that will be necessary for your inclusive vision of the future. Especially an overlarge raise. If we're gonna raise it, it should be gradual just in case. No need to be risky.

All the stress tests show is that we need a fee market. 20 MB blocks would be trivially easy to fill in the same way. Without a fee market there is nothing but shooting in the dark as far as allocating blockspace, so the stress tests have nothing to say about blocksize right now. 
Once a fee market is in place, run a stress test and what should happen is that fees just increase slightly during the test. The level of increase will be useful information about blocksize, and if fees turn out to be too easy to push too high, we will probably have consensus for at least a few more MB.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:47:23


Exactly. His job description as he sees it doesn't involve controversial changes. That's fine, it just means his statements about blocksize are more an expression of how he sees his role rather than advice about what the community should support. He's a great maintainer, but not - or doesn't want to be - a decision maker. All right, easy enough, just discount his opinion about the blocksize when querying Core dev views.

@_date: 2015-06-09 04:19:08
I think there's a subtle error in saying "most" devs don't support it. Selection bias. The seen and the unseen. There have been many people who wanted core dev status but were rebuffed and politically blockaded by the establishment veto power, and ending up frustrated and leaving. What about those devs? What about the devs who would might have been if not for that entrenchment, who saw the situation and never even tried? Those devs may be less conservative...
But no! It is already wrong to call those in support of "wait and see" conservative. It is them who propose hitting the hard cap, which has up to now essentially not had an effect. The conservative approach would be to maintain the status quo by keeping the cap well above average transaction volume. Hitting the cap is surely what needs more testing. How has the argument been allowed to be reversed in this way? Satoshi never meant the cap to be hit. Rather, the gridlock of devs has gradually arranged for the less conservative position of "let's hit the hard cap," but they have been allowed to get away with this without sufficient testing and even reframe the argument to the absurdity that it's the more conservative position of Gavin and Mike that "needs more testing" while their more radical position of re-purposing Satoshi's anti-spam ad hoc measure as some kind of new core tenet of Bitcoin doesn't need testing simply because it has long since "been in place" in the most trivial sense. Gavin, how have you allowed the logic to be turned upside down on you?
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:18:11


No, because fees. And if fees somehow aren't enough even in a Bitcoin success scenario, there would probably be consensus for whatever inflation rate change would provide the right security - though of course that would be the ultimate third rail until we were actually close to getting 51% attacked due to low hash rate. To users it doesn't matter all *that* much how the miners get paid. Paying a few bucks per year in transaction fees versus the same amount in unexpected inflation, with almost zero fees, is almost identical from a user/holder standpoint, though with some incentivization of more transactions in the latter situation.


Yes it has a grow a certain amount or die. But that's not Satoshi betting the farm; it's just the reality of the endeavor. If Bitcoin doesn't thrive it will because it had a fatal flaw or because something replaced it. It had to grow or die either way.

Great idea, but let's not kid ourselves that a large hassle/cost is why the node count has fallen. *Any* hassle or cost + having a host of easy options to completely avoid that, is why. You could cut full node running cost/hassle by 99% and still most people will not bother.

@_date: 2015-06-01 07:19:47
You have to weigh nodes being more expensive with node owners (BTC holders) being richer because of bigger blocks allowing more adoption. Or if you want to look at it from the other side, you have to weigh cheap node operability with node owners getting poorer as their BTC holdings decline because adoption is slowed. (Not that it will be, much; consensus becomes a lot easier for bigger blocks if that starts to happen.)
However, I don't think we need to take a big consensus-breaking 20x jump into the unknown. Let's do 4MB and see what the effects are. If centralization effects turn out to be mild or nonexistent (or even negative!) there won't be so many skeptics.
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:14:06
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:04:27
That's actually quite an accurate summary of the essence of the debate: 
Bitcoin has to change to a higher cap in order to stay the same in that it has always operated with a cap that is far above the average blocksize. Alternative version: The cap has to be changed upward to make sure Bitcoin remains the same in that Satoshi's original intent in inserting the cap was as a temporary anti-spam measure that would be increased by the time we get near it.
But conversely, the "wait and see" proponents say that Bitcoin has to stay the same (in terms of what is hardcoded, not the original intent) in order for fee pressure to streamline the fee market and effect all the leaner optimization changes that are feasible before implementing the more klugey brute-force measure of increasing the blocksize limit.

A lot of people are working on alternatives to raising the blocksize, though, because there's also an "OMG centralization" angle.

There was Bitmit, but the problem is as a seller/buyer it's just not a big marginal benefit to use a very small Bitcoin-powered eBay because you're unlikely to find/sell what you need, nor at a competitive price, just because of the immense network effects of services like eBay. 
You can save quite a bit in fees, but it's not going to be any kind of go-to solution unless you have the added benefit of the products you're looking for being un-offerable on eBay. Hence the success of Silk Road and its progeny. *Later* we'll compete with eBay, or eBay will just adopt Bitcoin.

Kind of meaningless without actual numbers, especially net worth vs. earning ability. If you only have $1000 in assets and you make $3000/month, 90% of that allocated to bitcoin seems like no big deal. Losing it all is fine because you can just buckle down for a month or two and save it back up again. If you're retired and have $200,000 in assets and little income, though, 90% looks extremely aggressive. However, if during a price run-up like in 2013, if you sell more than about 30% per doubling (maintaining BTC at about 70% of your assets) you don't end up with all that much of a return compared to if you go more aggressive.

I like the idea of making 1MB the soft limit and this time actually holding to it until the pain point, unlike with the past soft limits. That way we can preview the "[crash landing]( scenario and see how the fee market evolves but be able to escape it quickly without having to roll out an emergency hard fork if it gets too painful or is coinciding with a major mainstream uptake event. A controlled stress test of small block limits that can be ended at any time.

Strictly speaking a fee market only requires that miners advertise their prices in a feed, and that wallets serve those fee options up to the user in a user-friendly way. Even something more primitive than that would help, but we won't get it until there's an immediate and persistent need for it. 
It's not so much a matter of "we need more time for this to be coded," but rather "we need there to be a need for it in the first place." If stress testing becomes a common things, that might set these things in motion, but more likely it will be organic demand that does it. 


It cuts both ways. The point is the stress test says nothing about blocksize yet. 20x is not much to ask an attacker to beat an event that was in planning for less than a day. I'm not saying the network is vulnerable to such an attack, but that you'll get a far larger increase in transaction availability by having a fee market than you will by increasing the blocksize, and the latter involves potentially big tradeoffs. I don't personally think we need a cap at all, but the concerns are there and splitting the consensus is not something to take lightly.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:28:58

Just pay a bit more. What you're really talking about is fees being too high, in which case yes, THEN it will be time to increase the cap.

People can pay miners of other coins if fees rise too high in Bitcoin. Fees can probably rise quite a bit, and that will economize the Bitcoin block space, but there is a definite limit to it. Blocksize has to be as big as it can be, rather than endlessly conservative because of airy conjecture. A less conservative altcoin will gladly try bigger blocks. In fact there are probably a bunch in development as we speak, ready to try to capitalize on the Core devs' obstructionism.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:16:07
We have allowed the small block crew to frame the debate such that the code itself is the focal point, so that pedantically the 1MB cap has "been there for years" and so the burden of consensus is on those wanting a "change." The big picture, however, is that the 1MB cap hasn't been capping anything yet, so letting it get hit should be treated as a proactive change itself requiring consensus. The default, conservative position should be to maintain Bitcoin as a system running as it always has: with blocksize cap far above actual transaction volume. The radical position is to let the cap be hit, let blocks fill up, and see what happens. How have we let this huge change be framed as the "status quo," when increasing the blocksize a few multiples to match growth in transaction volume would almost indisputably be closer to neutral, closer to status quo. 
It is such a narrow view, imagining the code in pure isolation, to claim that consensus is needed for the "change" of keeping Bitcoin running with un-full blocks.

This is a misunderstanding of the whole idea of open source. Consensus is achieved by having everyone choose the fork they like, not by having each *fork* be developed through consensus. That's taking the structure of open source and spitting on it, saying "fuck open source consensus, we want plain old democratic consensus." This gets you all the disadvantages of planning committee gridlock with no advantages over the basic forking mechanism. It's redundant consensus. The idea of a "benevolent dictator" is a complete misnomer when you can just fork off!

Economic incentives will always support broad Schelling consensus among stakeholders, even if not among the designated Core devs.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:09:09
I don't think we should have a hard blocksize cap at all, it should be economic where miners weigh big blocks against the risk of orphans. If in *that* case we find fees rising hyperbolically, we're in an extreme, world-dominating success scenario already and some other way will have be found to increase transactions because Bitcoin is "too popular."
EDIT: To make my point clearer, I'm not for artificially subsidizing miners with small block limits. Fees should converge to the actual marginal costs of including the each transaction, which should be very very low. However, for consensus reasons ("let's not ditch 5/6 of our technical experts") it would be best for now to work with various flavors of blocksize limit, in which case we need fees to rise so that blocks can't fill up and cause backlog in a "crash landing" scenario like Mike Hearn warns about (though I think he neglects how a more transparent fee market would avoid this). If this turns out to be artificially limiting, that should become pretty obvious and we should be able to get consensus to raise it. If not, then yes we ditch the dead weight.

I rarely find myself disagreeing with you, but this bit seems off. The mere fact that forking can happen easily when there is a pressing need does not at all imply that forking will happen whimsically or that a fork will ever successfully change the user-facing properties that form its core value proposition. And even if being able to fork often were a bad thing, it could not be prevented anyway. 
I prefer to think of it in a "Many Worlds" QM sense that Bitcoin is forking every moment, just to the same state over and over (so far). We users and investors are just making a constant decision to maintain the current codebase, and switch when the Core devs agree (at least so far). In some cases, though, the decision to stay the same as the outside world changes is actually a vote for change. The 1MB cap is the premier example: it's a scheduled-in change to force full blocks as adoption rises, but we haven't hit that change yet. If we do, we - by voting for constancy in code - ironically vote for dramatic change in the overall picture of how that code interacts with the world. We vote to go from very un-full blocks to full blocks.


To reiterate the point, this set of monetary properties and behaviors is not determined solely, nor even primarily, by the state of the code. It is determined by the market in which that code operates. The apparent (not actual) paradox is that in some cases it will be necessary to change the code in order to maintain the expected constancy of said properties.
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:51:32
This actually is a positive for the anti-increase (actually the "wait and see") camp, because it is against the "crash landing" idea that fees won't just rise smoothly. Wallet developers and miners should start getting set up to interface a little on fees so that the existing fee market can be streamlined in preparation for this fee pressure. With luck we'll get *both* a working fee market and a blocksize cap increase and everyone can feel good that capacity is both growing steadily and growing with market-efficiency.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:26:57
All the stress tests show is that we need a fee market. 20 MB blocks would be trivially easy to fill in the same way. Without a fee market there is nothing but shooting in the dark as far as allocating blockspace, so the stress tests have nothing to say about blocksize right now. 
Once a fee market is in place, run a stress test and what should happen is that fees just increase slightly during the test. The level of increase will be useful information about blocksize, and if fees turn out to be too easy to push too high, we will probably have consensus for at least a few more MB.

Core dev Pieter Wuille had an interesting comment on the mailing list:


network more decentralized". Running 1000 nodes which are otherwise unused only gives some better ability for full nodes to download the block chain, or for SPV nodes to learn about transactions (or be Sybil-attacked...). However, *using* a full node for validating your business (or personal!) transactions empowers you to using a financial system that requires less trust in *anyone* (not even in a decentralized group of peers) than anything else. Moreover, using a full node is what given you power of the systems' rules, as anyone who wants to change it now needs to convince you to upgrade.
The [whole post]( is quite good on the blocksize issue. Note that he's for increasing the blocksize cap, with caveats.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:51:32
I don't imagine most of the devs are going to quit if a small, overwhelmingly popular/supported increase gets pushed through even if they'd prefer it didn't. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:04:52
Exactly. But $1 fees is way overstating it (for now). Simply adding a few cents would probably do something like effectively double blockspace. Sure, if we keep 1MB forever, fees will go that high, and altcoins will thrive. And that's why we won't do that. The very moment altcoins are identified as rising due to high BTC fees, any popular will to keep the 1MB cap will vanish.

Yet during a big adoption surge two weeks is too long to wait for adjustment. Plus Ghash had a high hashrate for longer than two weeks. This idea is just something Gavin mentioned off hand in an obviously hasty email. 
A solution where paying transactions, not miners, can adjust the cap is what is needed. Meni Rosenfeld's idea is effectively this, because although a miner can adjust the cap upward they're not incentivized to do it unless the transaction fees are there.

There is always an economic cap, even without a hard cap.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:32:45
I agree. All the more reason to have a fee market (meaning here, transparent and dynamic pricing that is easy for users to respond to and figure out how much they have to pay to get their chosen level of prioritization on their transaction) so that blockspace is not filled up with low-priority transactions that people just put in because "why not? it's free." We can take those people moving to other platforms, and even if we tried to keep them all it would take way bigger blocks that 20MB. There are always tradeoffs.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:22:30
Correlation is not causation. There is by no means any kind of slam-dunk case to be made that bigger max blocksize means more centralization, as there is way too much confounding data, and in fact there are arguments for the opposite. We can move up the blocksize cap and see what happens. If we don't like the way it looks, we can move it back down.

We really cannot know, but it will keep permeating into many spheres of life like the oil from a cheesy slice of pizza permeates into a couch cushion. 
In 3 years the many disparate and seemingly trivial advances will have accumulated enough that they start to accrete and combine in surprising and multifarious ways that are increasingly difficult to anticipate. Random possible examples: debate and governance facilitated by prediction markets, interplay between dark markets and drug legalization politics, mining pools rendered unnecessary by variance hedges through insurance markets, Most of today's projects will fail by then, but people will learn from their mistakes and build on them. As each initiative matures and bears fruit it will open a new set of doors unfurling in ever more dizzying fashion. 
Today it is already wellnigh impossible to keep up with all the developments in the ecosystem, but in 3 years it will be completely impossible. Mini-biomes like OpenBazaar (or whatever arises from its ashes) will be nearly as complex as the Bitcoin ecosystem is today. In a bid to stay relevant, universities will start offering courses not only in Bitcoin but in sub-branches of it, financial institutions will have entire departments consisting of people with titles like Ricardian Contract Engineer, and governments will be twisting themselves into pretzels as various branches and individuals try to restrict or capitalize on the revolution, eyeing either tax revenue or investment returns from secret personal "offshore" holdings. 
Speaking of offshoring, I think the next big plateau in the $10K area will have arrived by then and that is when the dynamics will be right for a substantial portion of offshore holdings to move into Bitcoin, pushing the price to even greater heights once the new challenges at that level of adoption are overcome. 
In 3 years no one single person will be able to grasp the entire picture, and so around that time I predict there will be a push to fully implement market forces into all aspect of Bitcoin so that it can self-regulate. That will likely be the last hiccup on the way to mainstream adoption, though it will be a doozy and require and incentivize deep economic understanding.
By 3 years from now we should also have definitively answered the question of whether alternative ledgers will exist. My guess is they basically won't, though sidechains might. 
Scalability concerns will turn out to be overblown much like Malthusian predictions, both mistaking "the market will sort it out" as some kind of special pleading, when it's really the principle that underlies the success of everything in Bitcoin already. The incredible collective intelligence and coordination of the community will only have grown and become more streamlined and motivated by that time.
Pricewise if we haven't at least touched above $10K I think that means Bitcoin will have died or been superseded by something. Something like $20K-$40K would be my best guess, with still significantly above-average volatility.
Worst case is the ledger getting messed up by some kind of glitch, but I don't see even that as being able to kill Bitcoin, because what do you switch to? Unless the ledger gets FUBAR'd there'd still be little incentive to switch to an altcoin. I honestly don't see any total failure scenarios for cryptoledgers in general, though government crackdown coordinated among advanced nations would be a very painful setback that might take a couple of years to shake off unless the non-banning countries can generate enough tax revenue to change the advanced countries' minds.

You have to weigh nodes being more expensive with node owners (BTC holders) being richer because of bigger blocks allowing more adoption. Or if you want to look at it from the other side, you have to weigh cheap node operability with node owners getting poorer as their BTC holdings decline because adoption is slowed. (Not that it will be, much; consensus becomes a lot easier for bigger blocks if that starts to happen.)
However, I don't think we need to take a big consensus-breaking 20x jump into the unknown. Let's do 4MB and see what the effects are. If centralization effects turn out to be mild or nonexistent (or even negative!) there won't be so many skeptics.

Greece has the EU over a barrel. 
The EU can't allow a Grexit, because contagion would spread to the other PIIGS nations, then the whole eurozone would fall apart. So Greece gets to set the terms, which will of course be a perpetual, "Give us more money!" 
However, the EU giving in to this creates moral hazard, demonstrating to the other PIIGS that they don't need to be fiscally responsible. The EU will always bail them out if things get rough. Sound familiar? So of course they will be ever more profligate. There is little motivation to behave. This eventually bleeds the EU dry. It's the slow contagion, and it's what will get chosen simply because it's politically preferable to the fast contagion mentioned above. There will be no Grexit, just more and more sucking the richer countries of the EU dry until they get sick of it. 
For the rich countries (Germany, etc.), once the pain of staying in the EU exceeds the pain of leaving, they will leave. Probably to join some BRICS-oriented currency system backed by hard assets. The productive countries will unite.

I'd prefer it were included into Core rather than running XT.

Decisions on what? Core devs only make decisions on proposals that are given the provisional toy moniker of "official"-ness. It is up to users, miners, and all other Bitcoins stakeholders to choose their upgrade path from among the options supplied by the Core devs, and anyone else who might create their own implementation or fork. 
There is no actual official implementation that the Core devs get to control, only one where there is a high degree of built-up trust, but that provisional trust can and will be revoked immediately in the event of a decision viewed as improper by stakeholders.

Holy shit! Doesn't this mean that node count will *never* fall below a certain threshold, as long as Bitcoin remains a thing, because if it got too low the incentive to run your own node to verify things for yourself would suddenly jump. It's a self-correcting problem.
A caveat is that this logic doesn't apply to the third world or remote places with poor connectivity. Still, there are plenty of places in the world, and plenty of people, who do have access to fast connectivity and computing resources, where this logic does apply, so it will just be like using an SPV wallet, as most people do now anyway. 
TL;DR: People would be motivated to run a full node themselves if node count fell anywhere near actually problematic levels.

I was thinking miners would dynamically adjust their rates and publish them in a feed that wallets could draw from to estimate confirmation time for a given fee size. In terms of user experience, the smoothest implementation would probably just present the user with a "priority transaction" box to tick that would up the fee to a degree sufficient to have &gt;90% statistical confidence of being included in the next block. And have warnings during peak times that the base fee to get confirmation any time soon will be somewhat elevated.

Yes it's true that whenever Gmax talks about this he takes a very removed perspective and phrasing, like, "Nodes have dropped." It doesn't sound like he's thinking about it from user experience terms at all, except this vague notion that people just don't have the resources. If I recall, QT was no picnic to run in 2012 compared to an SPV wallet now. I bet if you lined up the numbers you'd find the development of better SPV wallets and the growth of BC.i corresponds with the loss of full nodes far more. 
In other words, Bitcoin-QT was far beyond the pain threshold already that divides casual users from hardcore ones; the only thing holding the node count high back then was a lack of recommendable alternatives. Heck I remember trying MultiBit back in 2012 or early 2013 and it was a piece of shit slow thing even though it was supposed to be faster.

The processing and bandwidth resources of the network can be put toward decentralization, toward more capacity, toward anonymity, or other things, but they are not unlimited. They will be allocated as needed to respond to threats. If anonymity is the greatest threat, resources will be diverted preferentially toward that. Bitcoin needs to be attacked before it will know which way to adapt, before it will know which threats are clear and present and which are hypothetical and distant.

I think the main reason people really stopped using it was the price rise. People were too lax with their PC opsec so they were getting their coin stolen left and right AND complaining loudly about it because it had tenfolded/hundredfolded in value. It was soon recognized that mainstream adoption could be about to arrive and it would be lunacy to recommend QT. People were told to make offline wallets and use SPV and blockchain.info. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:10:29
If we start hearing about companies being skeptical about using Bitcoin because of the capacity AND somehow this changes with a mere 20x capacity, then we're talking a clear and present issue. 
The bottom line is we can raise it quickly if it's urgent. The 1MB limit is not going to hold back adoption. If anything, the careful debate gives confidence to corporations that every measure is taken to ensure nothing breaks.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:54:08

Then stop calling it the "reference" client. People need to learn to think fluidly about implementations. There is no official/reference client.

Tim Swanson always had a poor understanding of what Bitcoin is and why it's important, though  the push for merchant adoption with Bitcoin as "already currency" in the past few years is partly responsible for giving some of the false impression.

No one is for keeping the wall in place for all time. (!!!) 
You would obviously never get 1 BTC fees, because adoption would slow way before that due to fees much lower than that, and as soon as adoption started to slow people would clamor to tear down the wall and it would be done. 
The key here is to think how incentives and views change as situations change. You can't just look at one factor while imagining that everything else stays constant. The system dynamically adjusts, radically so.

Isn't this predicated on the idea that 1MB is the ideal size today? If the ideal size today is 5MB, then this looks a lot better. 17% growth from 5MB for 7 years would put us at 15MB. With all the other optimizations and LN and such, this seems almost reasonable.

@_date: 2015-06-24 18:50:16
Also, it's "Core dev," with a capital C. Because of the nature of the forking process in open source, Core is nothing more than one implementation. It has no actual official status, even though the dominant usage patterns allow for the imprecision of calling it the "official" or "reference" client. That could change very easily, though. Without user support, "Core" becomes just an appellation of convention.
Therefore you have to ask yourself, why not the bitcoind, BitcoinJ, etc. developers? What do they think? Why would their opinion be less relevant? After all, the reasons they're working on alternative implementations may very well be that they disagree with the "consensus" gridlock in Core. Perhaps they have been rebuffed when trying to introduce changes. Perhaps even because of this very blocksize issue. And how many devs didn't even bother trying to introduce changes because they knew they would be rebuffed, seeing the climate as it was, created by the current crop of devs. 
If so, a poll of the Core devs represents a gross survivorship bias: to decide that the *Core* devs are the only ones that matter is to bias the poll before it is even taken.
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:21:26
I bet there would be ways to get around that, since you can never tell who's pushing tx's if the sender uses TOR and mixes up the addresses for instance. Though some mining pool operators might just use their gut, which I suppose could work. But really, a fee market is the solution. We need a fee market no matter the case we're looking at. 
But really it's a self-solving problem either way. Bigger blocks as a first resort just means the fee market forms later, which is arguably less elegant.
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:46:49
Yes, that needs to be emphasized more, so as not to scare off the casual observers. Even the "doomsday" scenario of an attacker taking over several mining pool operators and pulling off some large doublespends is not going to destroy Bitcoin...because there is no alternative to run to. Measures would be taken, pool security would increase, p2pool would be used more, an explosion of new ideas would be tried, people would wait longer for confirmations, and there would be a limit on how much value people would send per transaction in cases where double-spending could matter. 
Even in such a scenario there is still no alternative for all the things that Bitcoin is uniquely good at (certainly not altcoins, as their security is even worse). Although it's not usually productive to acknowledge it, there's a whole lot of fail that can be experienced in Bitcoin before the experiment itself gets close to failing. That means no matter where this blocksize cap debate goes, the worst that happens is temporary setbacks.

Price is orthogonal in a sense, because although the hash rate grows as the price rises, so does the incentive to 51% attack. Therefore the halvings do result in lower security standards unless there is a commensurate rise in fees (which was always the plan - anyone have a graph of fee revenue trends over the years? I'd bet fee revenue is growing much faster than the halving rate).

This assumes that a large cap makes it worse, which I think is far from obvious. It's a lot of conjecture. One can make similar kinds of conjectures about the dangers of full blocks and "crash landing" scenarios as Mike Hearn and many other have. 
The idea that letting blocks fill up is the conservative position is so narrowly code-focused as to be comical. Of course that is what a coder will default to seeing, that technically the 1MB cap has been in the code all this time so it's not a "change," but Bitcoin is much more than its code; it is the interplay between that code and the economic and game-theoretic incentive considerations of motivated humans. In that way, letting a hard-coded change stay in until it - for the very first time - starts to affect anything in the real world behavior of the system (constant full blocks are unprecedented) is a major change. 
**The burden of consensus should be on those who want to allow this scheduled change to happen, not on those pushing to maintain the status quo of a cap that is well above current tx volume.**
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:49:07
There's a huge silver lining to all this. IF we can get users to learn to control their private keys (or just make it dirt-simple), then we've not only solved the problem of BTC storage, but also logins and credentials for everything, including ubiquitous PGP (which has so far been too inconvenient to see much adoption). If we have complete end-to-end encryption by default just because it's easy, the NSA is going to have a bad time (as are Russian hackers).

If you trust Greg, you should trust his own words. He's several times expressed dissatisfaction that more optimizations weren't being tried before the push to larger blocksize caps, and he thinks it unlikely that these optimizations will come about as a result of time, rather they need the motivation (there has to be full blocks and some pain). It's not like he's plotting to keep blocks small forever, but he's definitely oriented toward having pain from small blocks arise to motivate things like what Blockstream is working on. 
Although sidechains and LN do eventually require larger blocks, their use cases present a lot more compellingly when blocksize is seen as a very limited resource, when people are thinking earlier about building on top of Bitcoin rather than scaling it directly.

Fee markets would work, but code changes have to be made, and there are risks. Testing would be required. In fact the risks of hitting the hard cap seem to outweigh the risks of bigger blocks. 
Somehow, though, a number of people have managed to reframe Satoshi's temporary measure as a new "core tenet of the Bitcoin social contract," and although the very nature of the cap means it has no effect until hit, so that hitting it is a huge change in the way Bitcoin works from the heretofore norm of being uncapped in any presently effective way, they have gotten away with painting those who want to maintain the status quo of how Bitcoin operates - growing continually without being effectively capped - as some kind of radical "change," when it is they who want the radical change, justified only by the technical triviality that the relic cap happens to still be in the code largely due to these same people's blockading. The circularity and topsy-turviness of that position is dizzying.

I finally get what purse.io is about after Trace Mayer explained it in that video. Take two problems: 
1) merchant doesn't accept bitcoin
2) people want to buy bitcoins p2p online, even at a premium
Purse.io solves them both at once, saving you hefty amounts of money automatically in the process.
You basically put in a limit sell order, and like on an exchange, if people bite you end up selling significantly higher than the market rate. The buyer gets bitcoins more easily than the usual methods, you get a big discount (average of 18% if I recall). The tradeoff is that you may have to wait a little longer for the order to be filled if you set your desired discount rate very high. 
I think this has been marketed wrong, making it sound too good to be true, like there should be some catch. It should be marketed that you can get a legit ~20% on ALL your purchases from anywhere, in exchange for waiting a few hours (and in some cases days) longer for fulfillment. 
For non-urgent items it becomes a no-brainer to use purse.io, and it has the bonus of helping people get BTC easier.

Open source's voting mechanism is the fork. You can always switch implementations if you don't like Core. That's decentralized democracy. Trying to redundantly make the dev process *for each implementation* itself democratic will only result in gridlock in that implementation until another supersedes it. That's what XT is about. 
Gavin is just being dumb about marketing this fact. Satoshi handed him the reins  over Core and he handed off to Wladimir, who insists that every dev should have absolute veto power. That has created gridlock, and not just on the blocksize issue. 
Gavin should either reassert control of core and let devs and users decide if they want to fork to a different implementation, or fork himself. Either way he is only "throwing his weight around" or being a "benevolent dictator" in a trivial sense, since anyone is free to fork off at any time. And really, anyone could be that dictator on their own fork, but if will only be relevant if it's what users want.
**TL;DR:** Don't try to do double-democracy for implementation. The forking mechanism is more elegant than any planning committee.

No one is arguing for keeping the 1MB limit forever, and also note that LN only needs big blocks to scale all the way up to global adoption. There will almost certainly be other innovations helping to scale further. "X does not scale" is a well-worn cliche in software. It's similar to the idea that the market could never figure out a way to provide services that are currently monopolized by governments.

A fee market is the *only* thing that can dynamically deal with a sudden increase in userbase. Even with 1 TB blocks, without a price system for allocation of scarce resources the only other option is ad hoc spam protection measures where we somehow have to judge based on certain non-economic criteria what constitutes an "objectively" low-priority transactions. With a fee market, priority is determined by how much the sender is willing to pay, and yet the amount required for the average user to pay is minimized since people do not make transactions frivolously. Just like any free market.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:29:33
Yes, and that's a very good thing. Although rather than "default" fees, the fees should be entirely market driven. If a block is empty the fee should be essentially zero. If a block is near full, the fee to ensure inclusion in that block will escalate, possibly hyperbolically as it reaches capacity. 
That's the exact behavior we want. 
If your concern is that Bitcoin would get expensive to use, that only happens when there is real demand, and in the face of that real demand the blocksize will be increased. All the while many new optimizations will be tried, as outlined by core dev Pieter Wuille [here](

One way to garner interest would be to start tipping people for translations on those subs and ask them to come over. This could be a major thing. Translation rates on the market vary widely depending on quality needs but it tends to be expensive if the languages are less common or less similar to English, so tip well for good work, especially for professional grade text and even more for ad copy. Rates for "I just want to know what information this passage conveys" are a lot lower than actual translation, and those subs get a lot of those kinds of questions.

Strictly speaking a fee market only requires that miners advertise their prices in a feed, and that wallets serve those fee options up to the user in a user-friendly way. Even something more primitive than that would help, but we won't get it until there's an immediate and persistent need for it. 
It's not so much a matter of "we need more time for this to be coded," but rather "we need there to be a need for it in the first place." If stress testing becomes a common things, that might set these things in motion, but more likely it will be organic demand that does it. 


It cuts both ways. The point is the stress test says nothing about blocksize yet. 20x is not much to ask an attacker to beat an event that was in planning for less than a day. I'm not saying the network is vulnerable to such an attack, but that you'll get a far larger increase in transaction availability by having a fee market than you will by increasing the blocksize, and the latter involves potentially big tradeoffs. I don't personally think we need a cap at all, but the concerns are there and splitting the consensus is not something to take lightly.

Remove the brinksmanship and posturing, remove the precautionary stance core devs feel is their duty to take (and I love them for it), remove the disagreements about how quickly upgrades can be pushed through in case of "crash landing" (Gavin and Mike seem to think a year, Greg and Luke seem to think a week or two would be enough in a pinch), remove the fact that all devs want larger blocks eventually and the opponents in part just see raising the limit as a klugey thing to use as a first resort rather than a last resort, remove the fact that Gavin is being a good negotiator and pushing for a bigger block cap than would be satisfactory as a result of these negotiations, remove the fact that hardliner "no change at all" folks become untenable even after a small increase, remove the fact that the most reasonable devs seem to mostly just want more testing...
Remove all that and there's not nearly as much of an issue here as it seems. 
Enough with the mistaking healthy debate for doom. What exactly did you expect!? A Sunday school picnic? This is Bitcoin, huge money is on the line, people are going to take all sorts of hardline stances as their way of trying to influence the consensus formation, precisely *because* they know they will have no real incentive to take any other option but to go along when push comes to shove. They can, because this is Bitcoin and you can do whatever you want, but economically people just won't.

The processing and bandwidth resources of the network can be put toward decentralization, toward more capacity, toward anonymity, or other things, but they are not unlimited. They will be allocated as needed to respond to threats. If anonymity is the greatest threat, resources will be diverted preferentially toward that. Bitcoin needs to be attacked before it will know which way to adapt, before it will know which threats are clear and present and which are hypothetical and distant.
@_date: 2015-06-24 20:00:12
Exactly. Schelling consensus gets us the rest of the way. 
Not that I agree with the voting mechanism, but the idea that a 75-25 split in preference "almost guarantees" a hard fork is silly. Only the most hardline folks will refuse to go along with a clear-cut 75% majority, and if all those against - from mildly to massively against - total 25% then those hardliners will comprise a *lot* less than 25%. And then we have to ask what happens to those 3% or so hardliners. I bet most of them soften their stance when 97% turn against them, bringing the actual final holdouts to something less than 1%.

Chance is about human knowledge. Nature of course knows no chance. (Misguided quantum mechanics interpretations notwithstanding.) Even the odds of a coin landing tails is subjective, although all humans will arrive at the same inter-subjective conclusion that it's roughly 50-50. Some hyper-intelligent being would give different odds based on the physical shape of the coin and trajectory of the toss, air currents, etc.

Well there are Bitcoin "shills" in the sense of pumpers who don't understand what drives the value. They scream TO DA MOON!! at every little thing or make premature declarations that Bitcoin is already a currency for everyone, getting some people superficially excited, resulting in later disappointment. 
To be sure, I argue that an accurate apprehension of Bitcoin and its value proposition will drive Bitcoin "to the moon" in good time, and probably a lot higher than even most of the shills think, but since this relies on people actually understanding Bitcoin I see such shills as counterproductive.

This guy completely gets it. Bitcoin is NOT a currency, and we shouldn't expect stability. It's a baby currency, if you like, but not an adult yet. Investment, for all the greed and sliminess and marketeering that inevitably attracts, is only the way this baby grows. 
Another implication is that, even though the arguments against deflation are pure fantasies concocted by the apologists for the bankers and government as an excuse for why we need the stealth inflation tax, it is hard to convince the authority-mired general public of that, and there's no need to because Bitcoin is not a currency, therefore Bitcoin is not a deflationary currency in the first place. As this guy says, it won't be a currency until it goes mainstream, at which time it will stop "acting like a stock" (that is, stop deflating) since there is no more upside. 
Bitcoin can be a currency or be deflationary, but it can't be both, as one is antithetical to the other. (Technically in like 50 years new coin issuance will be so low as to fall below economic growth, making it effectively slightly deflationary, but that's so far in the future as to be irrelevant, even granting the deflation=bad sophistry.)

A lot of the devs seem to be happy in their role as implementers and optimizers, not big decision-makers. It's not their fault if we shoehorned them into that role when this debate started. Many of the devs may be happy continuing in their position, and might not even care that much about the blocksize cap as long as things work out fine. They seem to be trying to tell us that their positions being conservative is not to be taken as "official advice about the wisest course of action" but as an expression of what they see their position as being.

Super ironic that this comment is about the dangers of putting the cart before the horse (mass adoption even if it undermines the whole point of Bitcoin), but itself puts the cart before the horse:
Why is it assumed, both by Tuur Demeester and Amir Taaki now (and many others), that growing the network larger would have no decentralizing effect? Sure technically it may not have a more decentralized-shaped graph, but the thing we want decentralization for is to ensure that no small group can be manipulated or coerced into messing with it. Growing larger does exactly that. Staying small does the opposite and leaves Bitcoin vulnerable.
To argue for a "decentralization" that is so ill-defined as to fail to encompass making the network larger and more crucial to more people, companies, and jurisdictions, is to truly put the cart before the horse.
To summarize, yes it would be silly to push for mainstream adoption even at the cost of ruining Bitcoin. But it is just as silly to push for an arbitrary amount of so-called "decentralization" at the cost of the benefits we actually want from decentralization. Smallness is not a defense!

That doesn't DoS the network unless they pay high enough fees to make it inconvenient for normal users to get their transactions in. And if that's the game, then the smaller the blocksize the less expensive that is to do.

First have them find out if any of their suppliers would accept BTC, especially those outside the country. Then they don't need to even convert (unless their sales in Bitcoin exceed the amount they pay that suppliers), and they save a ton of money in wire fees.

None of the core devs are for keeping 1MB forever, nor if that limit were causing persistently severe issues. Also, just because something wasn't intended for a given purpose doesn't mean it can't turnout to be necessary for that purpose (although it looks suspiciously like a sacred cow, that doesn't mean it is). 
But most of all, a precedent for breaking consensus among the core devs is not something to take lightly. If 20MB is too controversial, make it 4MB or something, and leave the 20MB fork in the wings for an emergency. I don't buy the whole "it will become harder and harder to fork later so we need a huge jump now," because consensus magically aligns during such crisis situations, as we've seen. No one wants to be on the side of broken.

She can sort of screw Bitcoin investors if she makes "Bitcoin 2," but not that much because if she managed to do it right - and so right that it actually stood a chance against Bitcoin - then Bitcoin investors will be getting in on the ground floor. Unless she premines, but even still just buy and make a fortune. The community knows and is in the best position to judge before most other people (though it takes a lot to overcome the problems with premines, so this is even less likely). 
But mostly likely she will either use Bitcoin or try (and fail) to use some bastardized blockchain that misses the point, *then* use Bitcoin.

You mean $32 cheap coins all the way down to $2? Even the three people who bought at $32 have had fantastic returns if they simply held all this time. The overall price history of Bitcoin is extreme rise, outweighing the much-less-extreme falls by a million or so percent. A million. Percent. If anything is being illustrated time and time again, it's that Bitcoin outperforms even the wildest expectations to the upside, though it doesn't get there in a straight line.

You sold 98% on a fallacy. The equities are only as secure as the BTC price is high, because that is what incentivizes miners, so there is no way companies will put their shares on Counterparty without the BTC price being high enough to warrant it.

Any scaling method, whether bigger blocks or LN or hub-and-spoke, does away with the argument.

Bitcoin tech should be governed by the forking mechanism. That's how you get consensus, not by redundantly trying to get consensus on the consensus (panel of experts). That will just result in gridlock without bringing any additional benefits.
"Benevolent dictator" is the correct model once you understand that since anyone can fork off and be their own "dictator" it's not anything like a real world dictator. It's a recipe for muddled thinking to use this term. The leader of a fork should take input from committers but have final say *about that fork only* of course. Don't like it? Just fork off!

If there ceases to be that million dollars a week of new buying investment (not actually anywhere near that much *buying* is needed, since many people mine AS their way of investing), the price will simply adjust lower. At $100 we need only a third of that (already inflated) number, for example.

Bitcoin is first and foremost, *at this early time*, an investment. As such, inevitably the financial incentives push some people to become rabid pumpers and recruiters. There is no way to remove the primacy of investment at this time, because investment is what serves as a bridge from now, when Bitcoin is still not usable enough for most people, to when it finally is. 
The same force that incentivizes the garish get-rich-quickers is what also incentivizes the get-rich-slowers, a.k.a. entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who build out the infrastructure that will enable that usability. 
For better or worse, investment will be central to the Bitcoin story for the next few years, until full mainstream adoption or bust.

That's universal value. Or more precisely, quasi-universal value among humans. 
"Intrinsic" suggests value in a vacuum, without reference to a valuer. That's like popularity without reference to anyone who likes you. To be popular means being popular *with* someone.

* Money isn't wealth. Money is a claim on wealth. 
* Hoarding wheat hurts everyone else because it makes wheat scarcer; hoarding wheat coupons *helps* everyone else because it makes wheat more plentiful (if you had instead used those coupons to demand wheat from the community, there would be less for everyone else).
* Hoarding general claims on wealth (a.k.a. money) helps everyone else because it leaves more goods and services available in the economy for everyone else. 
Hoarding money is a nice thing to do, and hoarding money forever (or burning it) is the ultimate economic sacrifice: you contributed to the economy and got these claims on wealth in return, then you never redeemed those claims, you *never asked for anything back* from the community. 
The lifelong hoarder can be called nothing other than a paragon of community service.

Everybody hodling doesn't mean no spending. A key part of hodling IS spending. Or selling, to rebalance one's portfolio, but any purchase that would be made anyway could be a lot more efficient just to buy with bitcoins that were otherwise going to be sold off.
The post that originated the HODL meme is by GameKyuubi, but the definitive post on **HOW TO HODL** is [this gem]( by Risto Pietila, where he explains that holding an exponentially growing asset for greatest personal benefit means balancing risk while not giving up on the big gains. That means selling off or spending 10-20% of your coins per price doubling, or as necessary when your fiat reserves fall. As merchants come on board, more and more of that selling can be redirected to spending.
Not to mention that spending requires holding for a some amount of time, and spending on a continuing basis (weekly purchases, etc.) usually entails some amount of continual holding just because of conversion costs and hassle. Pure hodlers spend and pure spenders hodl...the two activities are intermingled. 
So bring on the hodlers! They increase price and utility, and represent the most efficient contribution to the virtuous upward cycle.

To further clarify this, the revolutionary aspect is when machines can negotiate with each other **for rivalrous resources**. Road space is one example. 
So it's kind of a litmus test for when an M2M transaction makes sense or is groundbreaking. Does it involve allocation of a rivalrous resource, one that both machines cannot always access at the same time so have to take turns using or economize on?
In the context of a fridge, it doesn't get interesting until the fridge bids in the power market for the local power supply with your neighbor's washing machine. Perhaps you have some important items in your fridge that must be kept at a sufficiently cold temperature, so even if your neighbors all decide to do laundry at the same time, competing for your power supply, you're still willing to pay up to XX cents per kilowatt-hour, maybe even with limited momentary prices of XXXX per kilowatt-hour. You bidding up the price that way, along with the coincidental use by many other users at the same time, may trip some of their washing machines to pause their operation and/or query their owners about the unusually high price. In the event that that happened regularly people would just relax their price sensitivity settings or their wash timing preferences. Every resource gets allocated to those who are willing to pay the most for it. 
**And to preempt the objections that this hurts the poor, it in fact does the opposite, because power will be that much cheaper during the times that a rich neighbor isn't using it, whereas before it had to be at a constant set rate that was high enough for all eventualities, now a poor family can automatically take advantage of the variable rates by, for example, having the washing machine start a load of laundry at the least in-demand time.

You're taking a losing side, because the government *always* has a reason. It's just that usually the reason is due to some other bad regulation.

Insofar as you're "just a gamer," and in a country where you can use credit cards and have a bank account, there is probably no net benefit for most use cases. You have to also want to hold bitcoins for other reasons, or be interested in new tech, or have a special niche need, to make it worthwhile. For most people the reason they buy bitcoins initially is as an investment because they believe in its future. Once in, they might as well spend it because then it becomes the easiest way to pay for many things.
So it's still early days. Go in with the mindset of an early adopter and don't expect much net benefit (yet) if you simply want to buy games.

Patents in general are based on a cartoonish notion of how inventions happen, where a lone researcher has a flash of inspiration and makes a quantum leap forward. Even Bitcoin was just a synthesis of existing ideas combined in a coherent way. If Satoshi hadn't invented it in 2008, someone else would have within a few more years. Patents simply create monopolies that stifle innovation under the pretense of encouraging it.
Here's a [classic talk]( making the case in more detail with numerous examples.

It's good for the Bitcoin price, since it indicates that a way of obtaining bitcoins that *doesn't* raise the price (buying mining equipment) is getting more expensive than the way of obtaining bitcoins that *does* raise the price (buying bitcoins). Up to now, people that wanted bitcoins had a choice: mine or buy, and for anyone who understood mining it was actually cheaper to mine. But getting your coins by mining them doesn't bid up the price. Now mining is becoming less cheap, diverting money flows from the purchasing of mining rigs to the purchasing of bitcoins. 
If, to pull a number out of my ass, 50% of new investment money was going toward buying mining rigs and 50% to buying bitcoins directly up to now, and if mining has suddenly turned unprofitable now, that represents up to a doubling of new daily investment directly into bidding up the price. That is potentially huge, especially if mining becomes even less attractive short term. In this way, the price and the hash rate take turns skyrocketing...

No component of value can be coherently called "intrinsic." It is all subjective, because valuation is meaningless without reference to someone who values the thing in question. 
An item's utility for a given purpose may be an objective fact, and it might work to call that utility intrinsic, but we must be careful to distinguish between utility *for a given purpose* and utility *to someone*. The first could be said to be objective or maybe intrinsic, but the second obviously cannot, since usefulness to a person doesn't inhere in the item but in the desire of that person to achieve a given end (purpose). 
It is always and in every way wrong to call value intrinsic. Something can be universally valued, and it can be objectively useful for a given purpose, but people's valuation of achieving that end is subjective. We could try to say that a hammer intrinsically valuable for driving in nails, but there we are simply using the word *valuable* as a synonym of *useful* - it could be valued by someone, but need not be since no one necessarily wants to drive a nail. 
Value is a verb; "intrinsically valued" makes no sense.

It might become money some day, and if it does the price will be several orders of magnitude higher - the kind of gains fortunes are made of - and that's why you might want to buy some now.

They will let each company decide. Their pitch is to businesses making consumer appliances, not to consumers. Perhaps each manufacturer will have their own mining pool.
Note: I suspect mining pools are a temporary situation anyway. Once you can buy mining insurance or futures/etc. the variance problem should be eliminated, and once insurance is decentralized (prediction markets are insurance platforms by definition, just take the minority trade) the problem will be eliminated altogether.
Or heck, why not have no pools and just include in the contract that if a device wins a block reward *itself* then 21 or the manufacturer gets 75% of it?

They just take it. The key is the records will show that title never changed, so it won't be possible to sweep it under the rug. 
I gather that the idea here is to avoid local government corruption. Local officials or other lone actors (think Carl Mark Force IV) can't just alter the records as they see fit anymore. They would have to go through various more elaborate legal processes to take the property away from its owner. 
For example, if there were an eminent domain reason for taking someone's land and the government considered it legitimate to do that, they could take it and put the court order into the blockchain as well. This doesn't stop governments from being evil, but it makes it harder for local isolated corruption to happen because it's no longer as simple as altering or "losing" some documents.

Some quite unique points raised. The author wants Gavin's original proposal of 20MB limit + 50% growth each year and thinks that the lack of the 50% addition per year is a big problem because he believes we only have one chance for a hard fork. 
The example of how the Elacoin fork was killed by Cryptsy was interesting, because it shows that the market is the ultimate decider (in this case the coin was so small that Cryptsy was able to prevent the market from working, since it owned the market). 
I think, though, that the author doesn't take this lesson far enough: market fork arbitrage like Daniel Krawisz talks about [here]( seems to obviate the need for consensus. The market decides the outcome: old fork, new fork, or even a split into two systems. No consensus needed, though of course every effort should be made to avoid the split if possible. If hard forks are so dangerous, let's make them less dangerous rather than fearing them.

An ELI5 of either side would be very, very long and include a few courses in economics along the way. It's not that the issue is overwhelmingly complex, it's just that there are an almost infinite number of scary scenarios one could come up with if you change some parameter in the code, even something intended as a temporary stopgap measure. The problem with this sort of Pascal's Wager type of thinking is that it sees Bitcoin in isolation. In fact Bitcoin exists in competition with alternative chains that already exist or that may be formed/forked at any time, and those chains can afford not to be so conservative. 
Bitcoin does have an immense network effect going for it, but that effect has its limits. An arbitrarily high level of conservatism is ultimately untenable in the face of competition.

This is not self-evident. It could instead result in decentralization because more resources of all kinds, including developer interest, come with larger size and the larger market cap and adoption it enables. Harder to run a full node, but more rich bitcoiners having the cash to do it. Lower percentage of people running a full node but way more people in the ecoystem could mean a greater absolute number of people running one. Also more major infrastructure services that would find it in their interest (and within their now much larger budget) to run their own node, etc.


Most are agreed on this.

Note on your Point A: a fee economy is just that, an economy (that is, an economization). It doesn't necessarily mean fees get more expensive; it may even mean average fees get cheaper. The current prices are not market driven so we have no way of knowing, but since miners aren't even taking issue with current fees at all we can assume they are quite high. Now add massive adoption into the mix and the *market clearing price* of transactions must rise a lot, but for all we know the market clearing price is 100x lower than the average fee now, so there may be a lot of room to grow. And that's not even counting the fact that a lot of people don't need guaranteed instant confirmation, and that if they do they will likely be willing to pay a little more.

Gregory sounds like he's not sure what he thinks. That's OK, it's a complex issue if you try to take everything possible into account. There will always be arguments for both sides; the question is which is less risky, not which is perfect. 
But more than that, I think it's important to keep in mind why we'd ask what the core devs think anyway: it's because they've been intimate with the code for years and are talented coders in their own right. However, it was Satoshi who designed the system and its incentives, and he intended for there not to be a cap. No one in the current core dev team has shaped the incentive structure to my knowledge, so we really have no evidence that the core devs are particularly good at designing a system of incentives. That means *not* increasing the blocksize like Satoshi intended would be the first test of their design ideas as far as economic incentives.

Well I agree that if Bitcoin doesn't reach the moon in time, it dies. I think that's true for a lot of reasons, though. 
Miners do need to be rewarded, and if Bitcoin is successful they will be. If the fees aren't enough for some reason, then the block reward will have to change...as scary as that sounds this is the ONLY condition in which the market would approve such a heretical thing. (And it's not actually scary, because this scenario simply means instead of paying some small amount in fees you pay a small amount in inflation. No real difference for the average user other than psychological, though it's of course totally off the table *right now* and for the long foreseeable future.)

Don't forget the market angle. Bitcoin is economically speaking just a  ledger system. That's all investors care about being preserved. As a random example, if Bitcoin were attacked catastrophically, a few hours later say a spinoff appeared where the private keys to your bitcoin addresses controlled an equivalent amount of coins in the spinoff and it had the same coin issuance schedule, and all other aspects were identical to Bitcoin, but time was rewound to just before the attack happened. 
How many miners do you think would mine this spinoff? With trivial modifications everything would be back to normal in a few days, and if it happened multiple times everything would be back to normal in a matter of minutes. We'd call the system Bitcoin, everyone's wealth is preserved, nothing has changed except those last few minutes of history where the network was attacked. 
See, Bitcoin is not ultimately a blockchain but a set of shared values about how money should be (the protocol rules) and what ledger is valid (the UTXO set, i.e., the ledger), within a large community of people united by this shared set of values. An attack *can* mess up his consensus with regard to the last few minutes of history, but it cannot mess up the broader consensus up to that point. The market will pick a suitable block to revert to and start from there.

No, bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places, and could be made more divisible if needed. Even if only one single bitcoin were left in the world, it would still be enough to power all the world's commerce. Think of a bitcoin as a 21-millionth of the total money supply, because that's all that matters - the 21 million is just arbitrary. If the total money supply shrinks down to 1 BTC, then even having 0.001 bitcoins would make you wealthy because you'd have one-thousandth of the market cap.

It can't even start being a currency until its valuation is much higher.

Besides the dark markets, there has been little reason for anyone to use Bitcoin as a currency yet, and that shouldn't be surprising: currency requires a very strong network effect. The whole point of investment is to anticipate *future* utility and provide the capital to bring about that future.

Thinking as if you were Putin, wouldn't you want to stamp out local corruption? Bitcoin could be good for that: people say there's no reason for banks to use a blockchain for their internal business - they can just use a database - but when you really can't trust parts of your business (or the government you're in charge of), it can help a lot to have something trustless. 
You (Putin or high-level czar) can still loot and plunder as much as you want, because you can get the whole state apparatus to approve your decisions, but a local official engaged in petty corruption may have a lot harder time if all the records are on the blockchain. The local guy can't so easily enlist judges, magistrates, notaries, etc. to go along with his forgeries or "disappearing" of documents, whereas of course Putin can. Local corruption is a big problem in China and Russia, and probably elsewhere, but it's a problem not only for the citizens but also for the higher-ups. Putin should be a fan of the blockchain :)

Actually it does work the other way around, because when buying mining equipment is the cheapest way to obtain bitcoins a lot of people will of course do that *instead* of buying BTC directly. If you can get twice as many bitcoins by buying a Antminer, you buy the Antminer and just mine. This does nothing to the price. Yet, when mining gets too crowded all the new people coming in no longer have that choice, so they are all diverted toward buying directly, which naturally *does* affect the price. This is why mining power and price take turns rising.

We've made an urgent hard fork before in the middle of a major adoption and it went great. (March 11th/12th, 2013)
If we aren't afraid of hard forks, why not just make a bunch of small increases to the blocksize cap as needed, only when urgent? Then consensus is easy, both because the change is small and because it's urgent. And if we are afraid of hard forks, it seems we have to do several in the future anyway so why not master the process so that they stop being scary?

It looks like the growth was roughly double-exponential until the mid-2011 bubble, then roughly exponential thereafter. Did something else happen around then? And what about the soft blocksize caps?
(Since this is a log chart, curves that look exponential are actually double-exponential [exponential growth in the *rate* of growth], and straight-line slopes are exponential.)
EDIT: Or perhaps we are seeing an S-curve (in the rate of growth) that just happens to look linear recently but is actually in the process of tapering off. If it's an S-curve, that would suggest that fee pressure is occurring. On that note, it strikes me that the major mining pool operators have been absent from these debates (that I know of). I suppose we could just ask them if they are doing anything different with zero-fee or low-fee transactions as blocksize grows. It could be a nice reality check.

Their idea is that every dollar they spend on their project has a good chance of eventually producing many many dollars of investment into Bitcoin. That means if they just bought bitcoins with the money, the long-term price effect would be a lot *less* dramatic than if their business plan is successful.

Bitcoin is not a democracy either. If there is a sizable minority in a democracy, it gets squelched completely. If there is a sizable minority in Bitcoin, it can fork off and live by its own favored rules. However, people in that minority are likely to lose most or all of their investment if they go "all in" on the fork (selling their coins in the majority fork for coins in the minority one; they of course have the option of retaining coins in both forks just in case).

Why weeks? If it were urgent, like say Mike Hearn's transaction stagnation hell scenario, couldn't it happen much faster? I think the whole idea of a big fork planned far in advance, as Gavin would like, hinges on the notion that we can't just make a bunch of small, nimble forks spur of the moment as the situation demands. Which is true? Is the endgame that we master the forking process?

Parent said, "Not all vaccines are safe." It really depends on how many of those settlements were from the same vaccines.
Not to mention that there is a special court for vaccine claims, with different rules to normal courts, probably heavily influenced by Big Pharma, so the settlement numbers should be taken with a teaspoon of salt. Also, I'm guessing most would have gone unreported/unclaimed unless they were extremely serious. 
Whether the trade-off is worth it is another matter, but parent is without question correct. There have existed dangerous vaccines and there likely still are, though they have gotten a lot safer.

That's a pretty newbie-ish objection. Anyone can change the number of bitcoins issued, it's just that no one will adopt that fork. Just because you (Gavin) suggest a change doesn't automatically mean it will be adopted, of course. The illusion that "Gavin controls Bitcoin" is a pretty elementary error, although of course it is easy to see how someone could think that since the market is assigning a degree of trust, albeit entirely *provisional* and contingent trust, to your decisions.

For most of 2012 the price held steady at around $10. It had no usage besides gambling and SR, was never in the news, had only a few mom-and-pop merchants accepting it, had no venture capital at all, had no legitimacy in any mainstream quarter, no interest from any bank - let alone a significant one, let alone a major one, let alone most of the major ones, let alone project teams composed of executives looking into the technology, let alone actual large investments from several of them - it was basically just a toy. 
The price is now 25 times higher than it was, but Bitcoin is way more than 25 times bigger and more significant. VC investment is on track to reach $1 billion this year, and is being taken seriously by a "who's who" of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, executives at the top companies, and famous luminaries. We have not just interest but active investment by banks like Goldman Sachs and former JP Morgan Chase superstar Blythe Masters, UBS has acknowledged that "blockchain tech" will bring an explosion of disruption to the industry. I could go on. 
Bitcoin is on the order of several hundred times bigger and more important and more legitimate than in 2012. It's even a huge jump from late 2013. I don't think the price can hold at these levels much longer.

A lot of people who saw the price at $5 were pissed off they didn't buy at $0.05 and said it was stupid that they missed the chance to be an early adopter and refused to buy, and a lot of people that saw the price reach $0.05 and missed mining tens of thousands of coins for free said it was stupid and didn't buy. So it goes. The money goes only to those who really understand. Very few people "just got lucky," because if they had no understanding of Bitcoin's potential they simply sold it all when the price doubled. You don't just hold a toy that is for some reason unknown to you going up without selling after a doubling or three.

I am convinced that the existing fee market can be vastly improved pretty easily and will mitigate the constraints of small blocks, but I only emphasize that because flimsy arguments against small blocks just prolong the debate. Ultimately the raise must happen, and Peter Todd even said not even he disagrees with that. So it's not like there is any major contingent that is forever opposed, unless you consider Mircea Popescu major. No worries about 1MB being the final solution.
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:39:48
Sure, think how frickin' awesome that would be! 
The reason is, the only time a reseller could sell for 5x markup is if the airline horribly misjudged the demand and undercharged, meaning that the flights would tend to go to people who only had a casual interest in taking the flight and that almost no one who really wanted/needed to be on that flight would be able to get on. This would iron out those misjudgments like nothing ever happened, and the airline would lose money while empowering the most accurate forecasters of demand (skilled resellers) to grow and respond even more adeptly in the future.
Conversely, there would be situations where resellers would be unable to sell at almost any price - i.e., situations where the airline vastly overcharged. Of course, the resellers who mis-anticipated the demand would lose out while those who correctly anticipated demand would have refused to purchase the extra tickets, so those most highly skilled forecasters would again have more funds to more adeptly respond to demand going forward should the airline for some reason lack skill in this area. Fortunately, even the failing resellers would serve a useful purpose in that you could get on the overpriced flight for cheaper because the resellers who foolishly bought extra tickets will want to dump them at any price. 
In every case this creates a smoothing effect to better match supply with demand whenever the airline proves incapable of doing so. Essentially the airline is outsourcing its price planning, and paying for it as well :)
These resellers (scalpers) help everyone. Oh but wait! Some say these scalpers are evil because they buy all the tickets just so that they can resell for higher prices. But no, consider the above again: it is *only* in the case where the airline makes a mistake and prices the tickets too cheaply (versus demand) that the scalpers can make money, and again they make money by performing a valuable service. They ensure that the people who really need to take the flight can do so. Without the scalpers, you can't get on the flight at any time unless you were lucky enough to be able to buy the moment the tickets went on sale. And again, if the tickets *weren't* underpriced and this situation of you not being able to take a flight you really need *didn't* arise, the scalpers would be losing money and be forced to sell at a loss.
Scalpers are therefore a kind of investor, and like all investors they perform an [extremely valuable service]( In this case we could call their function in terms of investment "price arbitrage," or taking advantage of airline mistake to the benefit of the general public - essentially rationalizing the irrational pricing.
TL;DR: Scalpers rule! See also [Defending the Undefendable: The Ticket Scalper]( That lingering feeling that it's still not right comes from the fact that it's [not very neighborly, but it is economically very helpful](

It isn't at all obvious to most here, I don't think, especially because it seems to be a tacit assumption in Gavin's proposal. I think you could accomplish a lot by hammering on that one point. From a layman's perspective where it's hard to keep everything about this complex debate in mind at once, the other arguments that are more up-in-the-air/debatable distract from that point, even if it has ever been made.


I'm not sure this follows if we're talking about the specific case of breaking a bigger increase into a bunch of small ones. Because whatever breaks with, say, a raise to 20MB is presumably something like a combination of each thing that could break with each step in a series of 1MB increases. Better to take them one at a time rather than all at once, right?
It seems likewise for testing: having tested a big increase for safety seems to most entail the all the testing of each little increase.

Libertarianism, at least properly understood, does not allow for reckless endangerment. It's doesn't allow pointing a loaded gun at someone, for example. 


Sounds like you mean people who mistakenly think they (or some luminary) have the one true interpretation of what liberty means. In reality, the question of exactly what constitutes liberty, aggression, initiation of force, or voluntary behavior is the very purview of the field of law. To dismiss thousands of years of organic market-evolved rules by which society brings order to itself and instead just assume what constitutes aggression is "obvious" is an extremely silly thing some naive libertarian thinkers do. The common/customary law (not legislated law) is what encodes these rules that have evolved with the market test ensuring that they minimize conflicts, which would be the kinds of rules that would arise in a stateless society.
Here's John Hasnas, a Georgetown University law professor explaining the difference:

The counterargument to Peter's point is that kicking the can buys time for better solutions to be found. The counterargument to that counterargument is that maybe we don't need to buy time at all. 
If forks were easy, and perhaps they already are in the right circumstances, we could just raise the cap gradually in a series of small forks only when absolutely needed. That seems like the best of both worlds: substantial pressure to motivate efficiency upgrades with limited blockspace, fee markets, etc., while not having to worry about being "caught with our pants down" if adoption suddenly surges.

As far as I've seen, these "good traders" were people who sold when Bitcoin doubled from $10 to $20, patted themselves on the back and sat out most of the rest of the gains by just trying to make trades on technicals during the incredible bull run. They made more money than holders during the bear market, for sure, but the vast part of Bitcoin's history has been bull runs (obvious statement, since the price is now 100,000x higher than when it was first traded for half a cent).

If you argue we delivered a negative value in 2014 because the price fell, you also have to argue that we delivered a ludicrously positive value in 2013 because the price rose a hundredfold. But really we were doing all the same things. The base volatility in Bitcoin is still extremely high, so yearly fluctuations are really indicative of nothing at all about the value created that year. 
All we're seeing is the vicissitudes of market sentiment. Trying to pin a theory on random noise is fruitless.

A simple solution is easiest to ensure security for, and Gavin just happens to be the only one marching forward with a simple and reasonable measure.

Heartily agree. 
If we could avoid hard forks forever that would be one thing, but we can't. Might as well master the process, get infrastructure in place and best practices ironed out, and equip exchanges to arbitrage between the forks (thereby acting as a prediction market) in the event of an emergency controversial change.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:42:28
Why harder? I think once a hard fork has been shown to happen smoothly it should make future hard forks easier and less worrisome. That should calm investors, since the protocol can be changed without incident whenever truly necessary and truly demanded by the market. 
Note that consensus isn't even strictly necessary. Two forks coexisting for a few minutes/hours/days doesn't hurt anything as long as exchanges are prepared for it. They need to allow people to sell coins in one fork to buy coins in the other. Then through this process of "forkbitrage" the market will make a clear decision. And if it doesn't it can only be because it really was time to fork into two Bitcoins (no problem for investors, since your coins are held in both, so your wealth is preserved no matter the split). This to me is a beautiful solution because it
- Allays the fear of forking, letting it happen whenever it truly needs to without having to achieve very strong consensus, and making the decision quickly definitive (money talks, bullshit walks)
- Brings to bear all the power of prediction markets with their legendary ability to predict the future, in this case choosing the most economically viable fork and even a split into two systems in the unlikely event that is actually warranted (not an altcoin; all your wealth is preserved unless you choose to take a betting position on which fork will win)
-  Those who vehemently oppose the majority decision are not forced into the new version or nothing; rather, they can keep their version with whatever market cap the market sees fit to give it, knowing that exchanges and other infrastructure made sure the market was not hindered or blindsided into switching due to having no means of quickly and accurately coming to market consensus on the minority fork

You're assuming Bitcoin is primarily a transaction system, which is an easy impression to come away with if you browse around the more casual parts of the community like this sub, but Bitcoin is actually mainly a replacement for gold, and right now it's mostly used as an investment. A tx takes 10 minutes because that's the time it takes to reach the kind of unimpeachable, uncensorable consensus that makes Bitcoin gold-like (actually better) in its security.  
Another way of saying it is, Bitcoin is a settlement system, not a transaction system.

He doesn't decide what happens, though he has a lot of sway relatively. However, as far as I can tell, he supports gradual increases when truly needed, and he would not want to hamstring Bitcoin in the face of mainstream adoption unless that would definitely mean it becomes centralized - same position as most here, he just has a different estimation of how raising the blocksize would affect that. If he's wrong about that, other investors and actors in the space will see it and press forward.

Point taken. "Free market" doesn't necessarily work in situations where we really mean "partly free market, but partly centrally planned." Piecemeal applications of free market ideas will in general only work on a case-by-case basis. Dumb example: if the government says only one company is allowed to produce wheat, it would be foolish for a free marketeer like myself to argue that the company should not be subject to price controls. There's an "in for an inch, in for a mile" dynamic to central planning (and, in a sense, to the free market - they're a bit like oil and water; though it's possible to mix them, you can't make any blanket statements about mixing them *in general*).

20MB is a stopgap measure to buy time. 
However, Gmax says a hard fork to bump the blocksize cap little by little as needed could be easily done in emergencies. That means we don't need a stopgap. We simply raise blocks as a last resort, little by little, and only if absolutely necessary to avoid PR fiascos.

Hard forking needs to happen when necessary. The whole idea is that the protocol was initially created by human judgment and set in stone to operate effectively forever. In the event that it stops working well, human judgment is again required to adjust it. Since the need for adjustment is unplanned, we of course cannot anticipate when it will occur. It may be 9 months until the next scheduled hard fork but there is a major issue. Then what?
If the forks were say once a month that might work. We could master the art of forking, and only the gravest emergencies would require an unscheduled fork, which all the practice would keep the network ready for.

I think a ninja-mine also includes cases where a good faith effort to announce the coin or the date of commencement of mining was not made. It's much worse if the coin issuance schedule falls off steeply. 
For example, Dash had most of its coins mined in the first day, and its creator launched it before the official launch date, told people to go to sleep because it wasn't launching until the next day, then immediately launched it and mined the lion's share of its total coin distribution himself. There was also an "error" that emitted coins much faster than scheduled, which he took advantage of then fixed once other people started mining, but never destroyed the extra coins he erroneously received. 
Second only to Ripple as a poster child for unfair launches.

It's only worrisome for the bizarre theory that the very last stage of Bitcoin adoption - face to face transactions - should be pushed first, that the application where Bitcoin enables the tiniest marginal benefit should be trumpeted most loudly. 
Contrast this with online purchases, where Bitcoin lets you buy from merchants who might not have sophisticated security to prevent your identity and payment data from being stolen. Then think of embarrassing purchases, purchases from unbanked countries, purchases where anonymity is an issue (VPNs), and illegal purchases. Now we are talking serious utility relative to the other options.
To anyone who still entertains this notion that Bitcoin is a currency *right now*, let me explain something: Currency requires currentness. Currentness means that it is generally accepted. If Bitcoin were generally accepted, the price would be at least $100,000 per coin already. 
So how does Bitcoin proceed? Certainly not from brick and mortar adoption, nor even from Amazon adopting it. It starts with the applications where it can provide the *highest* marginal benefit: black markets, evading capital controls, hiding/"offshoring" wealth, other "store of value" applications, etc. Then as these have driven the price higher the infrastructure follows and then in myriad incremental (and sometimes sudden) ways new applications become feasible and are invented. VPNs, porn, remittances, and a mix of the familiar and radically new prospects that everyone here is familiar with. All this happens in a virtuous cycle with price, mining, venture capital investment, infrastructure rollout, increased trust, better image, better user-friendliness, the overcoming of security obstacles, more interest from coders and financial people, etc. 
Eventually merchants start start finding that Bitcoin spending during bubbles is a fair size of their payment pie, and then the cost savings raise eyebrows, they offer incentives for payment in BTC, and things really start snowballing for merchant adoption. Finally, *at the very end*, brick-and-mortar stores accept it simply because a sizable number of people already use it daily for online purchases. 
Most importantly, all through this process investors are buying BTC not to enable purchases but to capitalize on the coming stages of adoption. They are buying based on that future promise. They're using Bitcoin, not as the currency that it should one day become, but as a store of value and investment that anticipates the day that it does have currentness and *is* a currency. 
To quote my favorite paragraph from my favorite [post]( on this point:


@_date: 2015-05-10 18:43:12
And how do we even know the altcoins are really anonymous? With Bitcoin, to my knowledge, no competent user trying to hide has ever been de-anonymized. The MtGox thief, the Sheep thief, and many others...never tracked down even though there has been great incentive to do so. Measures to make anonymity trivial in Bitcoin will arise when they are needed, like when the blockchain is actually shown to be able to be used to track people (besides people who don't know what they're doing and don't use the recommended methods).

Miners simply have to broadcast their fees. Mike says this would be too unreliable when there were delays, but with a proper fee market there would never be delays anyway: miners would just charge as high of fees as were needed to keep blocks well under full, so that this delay spiral would never start. Centralized fee info is also not a big deal as you can simply let clients autocap the fee at like $1. That should allow for at least a hundredfold spike in transactions demand (demand at, say, $0.01) without issues. The centralized service merely helps save users more money; if it fails, transactions simply get more expensive. Bad PR, but not a disaster.
All that said, I support the increase. It's just that poor arguments against it will be refuted at some point so they do no good.

If you read between the lines it looks like you wouldn't believe in any solution that involved miners and other people adjusting their behavior, that you would only believe in a solution that is hardcoded. I understand that conservatism, though I disagree with it.
However, the two points you raised elsewhere - that delayed transactions are not a big deal and don't spiral out of control (based on past experience), and that hard forks can easily be made in an emergency to bump up max blocksize slightly - would completely allay my concerns if they could be established a bit more solidly. To me the whole point of Gavin's big increase is that "hard forks aren't something that can be relied upon in an emergency, so we'd better make one big change *and do it in advance* to buy us time to make other optimizations." Those two points you made, if you can argue them convincingly, undercut the entire basis of that push.

Absolutely agree. Not only does it imply "Internet-like revolution," it also is much easier to understand than "coin."

Mainly [this]( by Justus Ranvier based on an idea by Daniel Krawisz of the Nakamoto Institute. Also [this](  for the "forkbitrage" aspect. 
As to how I see them being developed, I guess miners who want to send big blocks (supposing this even happens) would get nodes to help ensure propagation, and pay the nodes for that service. Something like that. I haven't considered how the market process would play out very deeply, since that's always hard to guess.

Let's not beat around the bush. Bitcoin isn't for savers (yet), it's for investors seeking very high risk and very high return. 10000x growth in a few years up to now, to be followed by even more if it succeeds. I know investment and moneymaking are dirty and skeevy and make odd bedfellows with the spirit of freedom and decentralization and lifting billions of people out of poverty, but for Bitcoin to go mainstream it must be way, way higher in price and that means "savers" get a humongous payday (or lose it all). Investors is the only word that applies.

The game so far has been to introduce more and more complications to stave off NaS. The result is the systems are harder to analyze and demonstrate a vulnerability. That's not any kind of progress *until* those systems are fully analyzed (takes time) and have a track record in the wild with real incentives (big money on the line). Until such time, security demands that we assume the additional complexity is merely obfuscation (no implications that this is intentional, mind you), and that when someone finds the chink the network will be totally defenseless, not having built up the necessary "hashing" power to resist.

Mining of one kind of another is required. POS is just roundabout mining. (See video below.)


Perpetual motion machine. You can try as many variations as you want, but you can never get past the fact that an open-entry system requires a price for having a say in the consensus, and that price is determined by how valuable everyone finds that say to be.
For fun, here's Gregory Maxwell and Adam Back basically laughing off the whole idea of proof of stake, in any form, as being any kind of innovation: 


This is great litmus test for whether someone really understands Bitcoin and why it's a thing. The short version is that it's Gold 2.0, not Paypal 2.0. The block reward go almost entirely toward securing the *store of value* function. You need transactions to be reliable when they do happen, or else your store of value cannot be used and hence is not valuable. Just looking at the transactions that actually happen is ignoring all the value provided by simply maintaining a secure ledger that is trusted. 
And in fact this line of thinking is doubly wrong because the block reward was of course indispensable to ensure as many people as possible have a change to obtain their place on the ledger over the years that adoption roles out. 
To understand both these things you have to miss almost the entire point of Bitcoin and its design. 


The only way to do this is to either premine the coin or have an extremely low inflation rate, which means an instamine/ninjamine effect. As an investment and as a distribution scheme this is entirely broken. The whole idea is it takes a number of years for the crypto to be adopted, and this period is the investment phase where the price rises greatly each year (on average) and greatly eclipses the inflation rate. Everyone recognizes the investment proposition. Only later when the block reward slows down, which the creator tries to time around when mainstream adoption will have happened, does it become a "currency" where you could start to talk coherently about transaction expenses versus the total cost of holding.

Decentralization is just a means to an end. Or to various ends. Sure banks don't care about all those same ends that a lot of us do, but they do care about certain ones.

Absolutely the market should decide. The only question in my mind is if removing the cap altogether is too risky/sudden to enable the economics to play out and mature. Natural orders, of which a free market is one example, are exceptionally effective at allocating resources efficiently and adaptably, but they [take time]( to develop. Some kind of phasing in is preferable in a system that has to be "always on" like Bitcoin, though 20x-ing the cap in a single fork should serve as quite a bit of phasing in.
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:04:01
There is indeed a functioning fee market, though it's pretty hampered since there are only bids and no asks. You submit a bid and a miner either accepts it or doesn't. If they don't you have to wait a while and submit another bid. Miners could be submitting "asks" by having a feed dynamically stating the minimum fee they'd be willing to include for a given transaction size. 
I suspect the reason they don't yet is that fees aren't that big a deal for them yet. But thinking that keeping blocks small is going to increase their fee revenue more than allowing them to grow large is kind of odd. Charging a few people a lot is a terrible business model when there are competitors able to charge lower prices. If the concern is decades from now when the block reward is small, mainstream adoption should have maxed out by then anyway, and so a blocksize cap could be placed to create the right incentives (hopefully no cap will be needed at all by then because all resources will be in the price system, but that's a topic for another time).

I don't think you've been paying close enough attention, then. Neither side is as entrenched as it might appear, and as Nick Szabo says they're exaggerating the importance of their differing goals. Everyone is for an increase, Gavin just is the only one putting a plan out there aggressively yet, and big nuance is that a lot of the core devs apparently feel like a change could be made a lot faster if needed so there's no need to risk a change before it becomes urgent. 
Anyway, sell Bitcoin and buy what? Fiat? Bitcoin would have to fail incredibly hard and permanently for me to worry about the price. I'm seeing healthy debate and extreme care, making me more confident in the people behind Bitcoin. I would be more worried if this debate *weren't* happening.
Another nuance I missed for a few weeks was that in an urgent situation these same skeptics of big blocks would be a lot easier to convince, and several have said as much. The diversity of opinion and some level of brinksmanship is to be expected. I love that there's some crazy no limit guy, some crazy ultraconservative guy, and everything in between.

You could do one or the other, or both. There are various trade-offs and possible risks. It's a complex topic, but it seems that, as far as a scalability measure, speeding up block times is a somewhat more radical variation on increasing the blocksize cap. The first drawback that jumps out at me is that it's a more complicated change in that it effectively changes two things at once, opening two kinds of new possible failure modes and/or attack vectors at the same time. Generally simpler is better.

It's not a philosophical issue, but a semantic one. Value requires a valuer to do the valuing. Hence the term "intrinsic value" is nonsensical, or at least unclear until you specify how you're defining it. Insofar as it means "valuation without a valuer," it is self-contradictory.

It cannot simply be assumed that larger blocks means more centralization. Sure, just looking at the code and the resource costs themselves may suggest that, but as Nick Szabo said recently there are small games and large games. The hardcoding is a small game within a larger game of economic and personal incentives. 
The main example is that if bigger blocks allows for greater adoption then we have higher prices and that arguably changes the incentive structure toward decentralization. 
We can't assume the net effect is for or against decentralization.

If 
- Fedcoin = Bitcoin + inflation/deflation at the Fed's will
It would have the benefits of uncensorable money, it could be used on the darkmarkets, to evade capital controls, to offshore wealth, etc. but it would not be without inflation and arbitrariness in the monetary policy. However, since anyone could mine it, it would be free of the usual Cantillon effects of inflation so would be vastly better than the current system on that point as well, since it wouldn't be giving money to government and its contractors first to spend it before it ripples through the economy, thereby taxing everyone else. It would be worse than Bitcoin, though, because of the unpredictable inflation rate, which is bad for both financial planning and miner incentivization.
If 
- Fedcoin = Bitcoin + AML/KYC
That would be great as far as eliminating inflation, but of course bad on the uncensorable money aspects.
If 
- Fedcoin = Bitcoin + Inflation at the Fed's will + AML/KYC
That would be almost pointless, and would detract from Bitcoin not at all. This is the only system the Fed has a chance of willfully adopting for now, though.

@_date: 2015-05-07 18:45:46
Well it will push people to off-chain transactions, with only the more important (big value) transactions happening on-chain. That is a bad thing, I agree, but it isn't fatal nor is it irreversible. A later increase in the blocksize when the ill effects are seen (much easier to get consensus then) will allow for more transactions to happen on-chain again. Sure, some people will get used to trusting Coinbase, etc., which is not good, but it's not the end of Bitcoin either. Just like what happened with MtGox, it will be sucky and take a while to recover from but not catastrophic. It is antifragile in the sense that any missteps like that will expose the system to attack, and then get corrected as people "get their heads right" about the issue because they can see they were wrong.

Good answer. The trick with libertarian solutions is they often require you to go whole-hog and privatize everything.

Since there are altcoins waiting to take over if Bitcoin falters too much, the question is one of optimal scaling: how to get the scaling closest to exactly right. Zero scaling and sticking with an arbitrary number Satoshi inserted as a stopgap measure is clearly out of the question. Maybe Gavin's proposal is not optimal, but the debate should be about what is. It's irrelevant to say, "Well, it's pretty good for what it is." It has to be pretty good in comparison with the competition.

But then there seem to be just two cases.
Case 1: Miners are in general not concerned about orphans so they let the blocks fill close to 20MB, taking the attacker's fees as a gift. Isn't it true that insofar as these sizes would push nodes out of the network they would to the same degree result in orphaning? If so, in this case there are no centralization issues.
Case 2: Miners in general are concerned about orphaning if they issue blocks larger than a certain level, so they self-limit despite the extra fees they could collect. To run the attack, the attacker would have to pay fees so high that they compete with the block reward, which means thousands of dollars every ten minutes just to achieve some temporary centralization, after which the marginal miners would just jump back in; you'd have to maintain the attack for weeks or months to put many miners out of business, at a cost of many millions, and if the price increases a bit more we're into billions and beyond. Oh but wait, whenever the small miners do manage to mine a block they are getting huge fee bonuses so they are even less likely to go out of business.
No centralization concern I can see here either.

This part seemed quite fishy, because the implication is that Nakamoto and Szabo coincidentally disappeared at the same time.

And if the claim is that those blog dates were later changed as a cover-up, why not mention that like the date changes that were mentioned before? 
And a lot of the rest of the article shows an affinity for loose open-ended implication that fits with this pattern. I don't see much here beyond the already existing evidence and having talked to Szabo in person.

Makes no difference. The average consumer is never going to make sacrifices for free. Only the tiny percentage who are charitable will do so, and that tiny group will expend significant resources to help. Everyone else will only do it if they are paid to. Ultimately full nodes must be brought into the price system. 
Charity is one model that definitely will not work, so there is no point in pursuing or even entertaining a future course that relies on charity. The only way is to grow the network's value to the point that a rich set of economic relationships are profitable to develop, ensuring that all network resources are paid for at the market clearing rate. For now, that means at least a temporary blocksize cap increase to buy time for these as-yet untested solutions like LN to be implemented.

Good comment, I've changed my view as of today - at least the negative half of it. That is, I still support a big block cap increase (maybe even no cap), but I no longer think it's at all urgent because it seems it can be safely brought in at the 11th hour when consensus will be a breeze (smaller increase probably though). As long as we have a proper fee market, I don't believe Mike Hearn's gridlock scenario will play out. We have the solution to spam right here; all we have to do is start using it.

He designed this incentive structure, the other devs have not changed that basic structure. Satoshi could be wrong, but so could the current core devs. It makes no sense to treat any of them like gods, but least of which those who have made tons of commits mostly on small optimizations because they fear Bitcoin cannot really scale to mainstream usage on its own.
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:21:42
In fairness the block-finding during the stress test just happened to be extremely slow. And also, miners haven't yet bothered to optimize their behavior to prevent any slowdown by improving their broadcast of what fees they'll accept, but if people are going to make throwing money at them through stress tests a regular thing, they probably will. 
I think as economically literate people we both know that the position that tx prioritization based on dynamic fee bidding is anywhere close to optimized is untenable. Therefore a stress test can't possibly prove we're really close to running out of space in the final sense. There is no real fee market yet. 
I am still a big proponent of a blocksize cap increase, but with Greg's claims in this thread that it can easily and reliably be bumped up as needed in case of emergency I can't really see the basic disagreement anymore between the two ostensible camps. I don't think anyone who knows a bit about econ would dispute that pressure incentivizes optimizations. If we are pushing a hard fork anyway the potential danger is baked in. We might as well make it a common process that we master, and small jumps as needed make consensus a non-issue. 
To me now the whole debate hinges on the question, "Can we really just bump up max_blocksize as absolutely needed only in emergencies?" That would mean the worst we have to fear is a few hours of slow transactions, while we gain all the optimizations that come about from that pressure. If so, almost the whole debate about stopgap measures is moot. We get bigger blocksize caps only when urgently needed. Everyone is happy.

Creating artificial shortages works great when you have a monopoly. You can jack prices up as high as people can afford if they really need to use *your* service. But Bitcoin isn't a monopoly. People will simply choose another system if Bitcoin's fees are too high. Most pointedly, people will just choose an altcoin that has bigger blocks unless Bitcoin gets trade-off at least close to right. 
TL;DR: Creating artificial shortage doesn't push people to pay higher fees. It just pushes them to use other systems.

Centralization makes Bitcoin vulnerable. There are real trade-offs, though it's not clear how careful we have to be on the decentralization front. So opinions vary. No one, I think, is interested in taking a course that they think would make Bitcoin lose its value in any giant or permanent way.
Probably the best way to make the trade-off won't come into focus in an at all satisfying way until the situation gets much more urgent. With Gavin's push we're simply seeing what happens when you try to get consensus in advance of that urgency really being there. I think Gavin has the conservative mindset of planning things well in advance, but Bitcoin is an animal of antifragility, and it needs some level of urgency/crisis to show its true colors.

All right, I accept that Monero is better than Bytecoin. Still, there's Boolberry and others that also use ring signatures. Plus all the better coins that will inevitably come out that fix whatever flaws Monero has. 
If the idea is that that we should replace the ledger every time we replace the protocol, there's no point in any long-term investment in these coins. The incentive is to ride them for the short-term pump, and then bail as soon as something better comes out...and that looks like exactly how the market has played out.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin doesn't operate on that dynamic. It operates on the dynamic of, "This is the World Wide Ledger, the strongest, most proven, most powerful, most invested in, most infrastructure, most skill and largest dev team...got on it or be left behind."

At this stage Bitcoin is still mostly an investment, so it is a gamble. Whether that makes it better or worse as a store of value than fiat depends a lot on your situation, where you live, and what your needs are.

I suppose when we say "soft" human judgment we're really talking about after-the-fact/unforeseen circumstances arising, which is a function of the broad variations in local customs, expectations, culture, extenuating situations, force majeure, etc. After all, human judgment is required to make the smart contracts in the first place, and it's the same with all contracts. It's really that not every eventuality that is relevant to "justice being served" can be anticipated, and even if they all could there is no way to encode them all into a smart contract. At least not until the legal field has advanced way way further. For some applications it will be cut and dried, but for many it will not be. 


There are ways to have a final (human) arbiter for each dispute without having one single arbiter that ultimately handles all disputes (a state). Here's [some ancap-style explanation]( on that.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:21:32
The 21M coin limit is a monetary policy that people like because it unequivocally says *hard money*; no central authority can ever mess with it. However, once Bitcoin is adopted (and if it's not in 20 years it'll never be), if one takes seriously the idea that economic majority is truly in control, the 21M coin limit could even be raised very slightly to keep subsidizing miners if that's what the economic majority wants. The economic majority will never choose a policy that ruins Bitcoin with inflation like a central bank would, but it might change the schedule slightly if that turns out to be absolutely necessary (like if a competing chain with slightly more inflation threatens to take market share). 
What we call "Bitcoin" is not really a static, Platonic thing like people assume. It's actually just the economic majority making a constant choice to "keep things pretty much the same" over and over because that brings the most value. The moment it stops being the way to maximize the value of the network, the economic majority will vote for changes - the most conservative changes possible - but whatever is actually economically necessary. Though we can't imagine it being viable to change the 21M coin limit now, far in the future it may be feasible to change it very slightly.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:02:01


That's an extremely misleading metric, because it misses the store of value services that Bitcoin provides. This is a pretty giant oversight because something like 90% of the value Bitcoin provides is as a store of value (Gold 2.0), not as decentralized Paypal. 
Not to mention that the reason there is a decreasing block reward is to ensure the fairest distribution during Bitcoin's investment phase, during which - if Bitcoin succeeds - the currency is actually rising in value rather than falling. So holders are not subsidizing the miners at all, on average. It was planned this way. It's a mistake to buy into the hype that Bitcoin is mainly a transactional currency. It should end up becoming one if it is successful, but for now that's not what the miners are mainly getting paid for. They're getting paid for making sure every transaction that does happen is secure, which contributes to the store of value function.

All hard forks should be arbitraged on the market. As long as both forks retains a value, you can play your bets by selling coins in one fork for the other. Or you can sit tight and you retain your holdings no matter which one wins.

Introducing a market for fees is a good thing. It means that more people can make transactions when they really need to, and that holds true no matter the blocksize limit. It allows us to do more with less blockspace, because transactions that are low priority for the senders won't be crowding out high-priority transactions. But a bigger limit would be better for now either way, because it would lower fees across the board (while increasing miner revenue because of the "low margin, high volume" profit model).

Graf and Selgin. Not what I was expecting from the title.
Did George Selgin seriously just invoke the Keynesian sticky wages argument and ignore the fact that Cantillon effects don't exist in Bitcoin in the relevant way? And gold, in the 1900s, no its supply manifestly did *not* adjust with demand enough to avoid much more rapid deflation than he's concerned about with Bitcoin. Meanwhile incredibly rapid economic growth that raised the standard of living dramatically despite supposed "sticky wages" or whatever other canards Keynes made up in his central bank apologetics. It's like Selgin phoned this argument in. He's smarter than this.

This is a classic example. Does possibly killing someone by infecting them through negligence (not getting vaccinated*) count as aggression? Some societies may indeed think so. If so, you will be held to account for that even in a completely stateless/libertarian society. Same goes for drunk driving, which some hardcore NAP supporters believe should be legal because it's not hurting anyone. Customary law (also known as market-created law) disagrees, which is why it has a notion of reckless endangerment. Again, it depends on how the society you live in defines "aggression." 
*Whether and when vaccination actually helps or is worth the trade-off is by absolutely no means cut and dried. I know reddit hates anti-vaxxers with a passion, but the situation is [much more nuanced]( than either side is usually willing to admit. Keep in mind that the medical field is one where 1/3 of the major "settled" findings are discovered to be false within a few decades, and that's only the ones we know about.

Interesting insight into the mind of this dev. It seems he has grown highly pessimistic about the state of Bitcoin over the years, that it's gotten so centralized and such,* and he thinks *smaller* blocks would be better. With that background, it makes sense that he would be hoping for things like sidechains and Lightning Network to allow Bitcoin to actually work at all. 
I came away with the impression that he is sincere but too focused on technical code aspects and not enough on the human and economic aspects. Also, although he agrees 1MB is not a magic number, the same point can be lobbed at the idea of an unlimited amount of decentralization. How much do we need? Rather than fetishize decentralization, I think we should remember what we want decentralization for, and optimize for that.
He did raise some good points about a more gradual increase, because a sudden 20x increase changes things to such a degree that it's more likely to break stuff. Rather than 20MB in a year, why not 5MB increase per quarter? 
The logical endpoint of his thinking seems to be constant monitoring and frequent conservative hard forks to adjust the level and maintain the artificial scarcity. Insofar as we keep using caps, I'm actually most sympathetic to this approach, because if 5 hard forks is dangerous then 1 hard fork is dangerous. We may as well master the process of hard forking. Gavin's "big sudden jump so we can forget about for a while" seems to be the worst of both worlds: sudden, effectively removes the limit until blocks fill up, at which time we have the same scary issue. How about a bigger but more incremental increase? That would be less sudden, retain the economics of the limit while buying the same amount of time, and make the hard forking issue less scary because it will become old hat.
*He must be speaking on a long time scale, because recently mining pools are decentralizing beautifully.

Miners don't actually accept zero-fee transactions unless they meet certain conditions (coin age).
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:53:24
I upvoted it, though I don't really agree with the main thrust. Because if Bitcoin is actually being used to trade any legit stocks, that implies a much higher BTC value in order for the miners to have enough incentive to secure those stock transfers.
A more general argument: The total value of all assets on top of Bitcoin will never be much greater than the BTC market cap, because the incentive to attack the network in order to double-spend those assets will be too strong if the assets are too valuable (unless you were to issue shares along with the block reward to the winning miner). 
That argument doesn't imply that stocks on Bitcoin will drive the price higher, but that stocks on Bitcoin won't happen without the price going higher. An argument that does imply it, though, is that stocks on Bitcoin will lend the system a lot of legitimacy. Also, things get far more efficient still when you can keep *both* parties - the buyer and the seller - in the blockchain.

It's the only answer that will be ready before late 2016 or 2017, and LN may not even be ready by 2018, if ever. Same with sidechains. It's all theoretical, whereas the risks of increasing the blocksize cap are themselves theoretical. Meanwhile, altcoins will be standing by, happy to take all that extra transaction volume off our hands for us as exponential adoption of crypto continues apace.
@_date: 2015-05-20 10:41:02
So you mean that if, say, the total value of all colored coins is $5 trillion and the BTC market cap is only $1 trillion, a large miner might try to double-spend some colored coins (e.g., sell stock shares twice), knowing that double spend will only hurt the BTC price and not the price the attacker gets for the shares (because share value &gt;&gt; block reward)? 
I've seen this concern before, but I think what it neglects is that a world where stock shares are colored bitcoins is a world where you are selling those shares *for* bitcoins. See what I mean?

Of course, that's exactly the ideal result *if and only if* the market gives value to both forks, which should be expected to *only* happen in the unlikely event that there is a "true hard trade-off" in the change made and that two separate systems become a necessity. It's unlikely and probably a crisis scenario, but if it needs to happen there is no better arbiter than the market to decide that. 
In all other cases the value of the minority fork goes to zero probably within minutes as exchanges (knowing of the fork in advance) enable anyone to trade coins in one fork for coins in the other fork. Abritrage handles the outcome far faster than any other attempt at large group communication or consensus-building.
Merchants would either make a choice on which fork to accept, or simply demand payment in both coins if they remain agnostic. However, this unwieldy situation should persist only few minutes as "forkbitrage" works its magic. If not, as noted above this is a momentous event where the market shows definitively we really do need two blockchains, so whatever inconvenience is caused in retooling (and it should be minimal since this is known well in advance) would be worth it (it would only happen if crisis would result otherwise) and extremely rare, if ever occurring at all. 
Note that of course insofar as there *is* a basic consensus, this forkbitrage on exchanges will turn out to be little more than a formality. It's simply a safeguard against the unlikely event of a necessary split or a gross misreading of the community by the dev team.

Not down to 10-minute intervals? And aren't both protocols' anonymity partly reliant on the number of people using them?
Also, there have been more eyes on Bitcoin's privacy than Monero's, so we don't have any way of knowing what attacks are possible with Monero, or if it even ultimately works. The market needs more than just hypotheticals to make a switch to the protocol that maintains the WWL.
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:32:51
Skip to the section titled "The 51% trade." His whole argument hinges on shorting BTC and acquiring mining power then performing a 51% attack. 
His fallacy is static thinking; he doesn't appreciate that the quantities he is dealing with change dynamically as the situations he is positing come to be feasible. He's like a kid looking at a baby lion and a baby giraffe, and thinking, "This tiger is winning their scuffles now, but wait 'til the giraffe grows up. He'll stomp that poor little cub into the ground with his big adult hooves!" 
He makes this error in various places:
- He says that the "bucket shop" exchanges of today don't allow for the kind of "high-powered" shorting that Wall Street can bring, failing to realize that Wall Street getting in coincides with Bitcoin already being much bigger. The lion does not stay a cub as the giraffe grows. 
- He incongruously suggests a scenario where billions of dollars in securities are secured by the blockchain while seeming to imagine that the hashrate hasn't hasn't grown astronomically with the BTC value rise that would bring. Conversely, securities of that size will not be put on the blockchain until the BTC market cap is big enough to provide the proper incentives. The lion cub has grown into a ferocious beast, but in the author's mind only the giraffe has grown. Conversely, the giraffe will not have grown into a big cub-stomping adult until the lion has grown as well. 
Besides this repeated error of static thinking, his incentive analysis fails to take into account all factors at once. The attacker can indeed try to "double-spend" a security worth billions, but as he says, the legal system will not agree after the fact, even if the blockchain does. What many people, including apparently the author, fail to recognize is that what Nasdaq and the Honduras are doing doesn't defend against corruption or overturning of title *through the official state apparatus*. It doesn't matter if the blockchain says you have a legit land title or a bearer share, the government can still invalidate it. The point of putting it on the blockchain is that it makes shenanigans *through non-official means* more difficult. The state can always unilaterally come in and tell Google to invalidate whatever shares you were issued, but it will have to do it through an at least ostensibly legal channel. This makes the attack not only pointless but bankrupting for the attacker, and note that this argument stacks with the above static thinking point.
Until companies are also anonymous there won't be such a thing as truly uncensorable bearer share transactions. And even at such time when there are, the above arguments apply regarding shorting.
Finally, the apparent ease with which the author thinks a 51% attack could be performed is vastly amplified by his drinking the selfish miner attack Kool-Aid (I believe this is Emin's misunderstanding, but this post is long enough already so I won't press the point here), neglecting other ways of guarding against a 51% attack (Gavin's proposal), and ignoring the antifragile factor in that any small "threaten the mining pool operator" attack instantly changes miner and client default behavior to remove hashing power from any pool that goes offline in a way that could be trying to do a 51% attack, not to mention physical security upgrades at mining pools as price rises (lion won't stay a cub), assuming we're still even using mining pools by that time (21 Inc., commoditization of ASICS; infrastructurally as well, the lion won't stay a cub).
Since the final piece of his argument is that securities cannot be subject to such uncertainties, which is fundamentally an argument about numbers and magnitudes (even the current system with auditors and accountants by no means guarantees 100% certainty), his sloppy thinking about the quantities involved cannot be excused. The cub does not remain a cub, and insofar as the cub does remain a cub so does the giraffe (the incentive to attack).

This is a myth that needs to die, and it is simple to lay it to rest: The block reward pays for security of not just everyone who transacted today, but also everyone who simply held. Had a major spate of double-spends occurred, the price would decline and holders would be hurt as much or more than spenders. The block reward goes mainly toward securing store of value, the main function of Bitcoin, not toward paying for individual transactions themselves. It is a category error to look at "cost per transaction" as anything other than an abstract metric.

Of course it has to die as an (high-return) investment to become a stable currency. That's a tautology: it has to stop changing in value in order to stop changing in value. That's why it's an investment now and a currency later. I don't see what's difficult about this.

Hoarding is great, but wealth concentration (beyond the normal expected power-law distribution) is bad. The inflation schedule is important so that people have a chance to get in before the price zooms too high. But most people are price chasers and just whimper and whinge when the price is low, only buying when the good times are rolling instead of when there is blood in the streets. The recent drop to $160 was the blood, but people feared a drop to double digits. It could even still go there, but then people will just turn to fearing a drop to single digits. They will wait until the price is rising and they think their gains are assured (probably near the peak of the next bubble). 
There is no solution for such sheepishness except actual understanding of why Bitcoin has a very high expected yield instead of constantly being dazzled or frazzled by the price - that is, by the vicissitudes of short-term market perception.

Miners can simply advertize that they are willing to include transactions of a given size for a given fee. This info just needs to be presented on the fly to clients so that users can set the fee that gets them the prioritization they need. In practice the client will probably present this as just a box you check for higher priority.

Quite a small difference compared to the numbers I mentioned, but yeah, it's something.


Doesn't really matter. They had to pay for the mining equipment. If they sought coins, they had a choice to use their money to coins or buy mining equipment, and they chose mining equipment. The more spend on mining equipment, the less they had left over to spend on bidding up the BTC price by buying coins directly. So it's mostly a wash.




There were a lot of big thefts back then, too. Maybe more. This one is a possible increased downward pressure, though no I doubt it's particularly significant compared to the numbers I mentioned.


Myth. The only way you get net selling pressure is if people are buying as an investment and then when they see something they can buy for bitcoins they coincidentally decide they don't want to be invested in BTC as much anymore. If people buy only to make a purchase, it's a wash because they buy as much as they spend (actually it's a very slight benefit to the price because of the time the BTC is held and in processing). If people buy as investors, they tend buy back the coins they spend (on average, though you'll see different behavior in bull vs. bear markets, but in total it's again wash; for every investor who doesn't buy back after a purchase, there's one who buys back all those coins and then some to account for future purchases).


The BTC unit is arbitrary, so this is meaningless.

It's true that investors have the ultimate control, followed by infrastructure. 
However, that fork-arbitrage solution is the last resort in the face of a necessarily consensus-breaking proposal. I no longer thing there is a reason to hard fork in a big controversial blocksize cap change all at once. Just do a bunch of small forks. The fork *is* the consensus mechanism! (though only for obviously-needed, urgent changes) 
Let's use it as much as possible so that Bitcoin can dynamically adapt, rather than fearing it. That way we can take baby steps often and if we take a misstep we can just revert nimbly. "Can't decentralize this!"

"Ain't broke, don't fix" doesn't apply, because the 1MB cap isn't actually doing much of anything yet. In fact the argument is the reverse: the 1MB cap is itself a "fix" that is waiting to come into effect. If we are to not fix things that ain't broke, we should remove the cap altogether, so that the 1MB fix won't be sprung on the system at some unknown point over the next year or so.

Good points. It would be nice, though, to have Bitcoin much more well-established when the hard stress-testing starts ("let's see how fee markets develop when block space is scarce"). That way it wouldn't allow for altcoins to try to encroach on its market share if it ran into problems. 20x the transaction capacity seems like a nice way to do that for now.

Yeah, and if there is any controversy at all I'm guessing exchanges will deal with both forks for a while, letting you sell coins in old fork for extra coins in the new fork, if the old fork had any value (or vice versa). Of course the conservative thing to do would be to not buy or sell, just wait. But if you wanted to take a bet, you could make some extra money (a lot of extra money if the fork turned sour for some reason and you bet on the old fork).
It's basically using the legendary power of prediction markets to determine which fork will win *economically*, which is what really matters assuming both are technically sound at first. It's a beautiful market process and to me it makes hard forks a great thing that should not be feared but embraced.

Of course more transactions for lower fees means higher total transaction revenue for miners, since you can always charge at least a minimal fee, so the miner fee objection is DOA. 
But it seems that the exchange rate part of Gavin's argument is untrue: the market clearing price for including a given transaction doesn't change when the exchange rate rises. For example, if the going rate for a given transaction is $0.02 (in BTC), it's not going to become $2 if the price moonshoots 2013-style. It's still going to be at least pretty close to $0.02, because that is what the market will bear. So I'd cut that last paragraph and the reference to market exchange rates. 
(Note however that the exchange rate *is* very relevant to the block reward aspect of miner incentivization, since block rewards are not set by the market.)
EDIT: I see I've misunderstood his argument. He was actually making the point I made above in parentheses. I thought he was arguing that average fee per tx would increase when the exchange rate increased.

No, OK, let's accept the premise that Bytecoin is broken and not just a scam: if not Bytecoin, then Boolberry or something yet to come along. That's the fundamental problem with altcoins: if you accept the premise that "upgrading the protocol requires restarting the ledger from square one," you're stuck with no store of value for the coins you invested in because any competitor can supply the same non-SoV features - in this case, default anonymity.
To reject the idea of a constant WWL is to reject the whole idea that there can be "premined scamcoins," because you're not using them for the store of value or investment aspect anyway, since they are all interchangeable. The ledger is the network effect.

The main reason governments won't do this is more subtle: the economy will form on a fundamentally trans-national basis. Companies will be radically distributed geographically. This will generate a ton of money, which means tax revenue for governments. That's all they really care about. They won't stifle it too much for the same reason they won't stifle the Internet: they get addicted to the revenue stream. They understand not to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, and even if a few governments misunderstand this, they will just push business and tax revenue away to the countries that do. Again, same as the Internet.

Yeah, the fee rates should be determined by the actual demand of users to get their transactions confirmed quickly versus actual profit/loss calculations by miners as to how many and what kind of transactions to include in their blocks. Bids and asks. Pricing schedules and rules, contingencies, maybe realtime feeds, client integration. The end result should be that a user knows before they send a transaction how big of a fee they need to have their transaction confirmed within a certain amount of time with XX% confidence. 
Users pay the minimum a miner will accept, miners charge whatever maximizes their profits in the face of competition, and the price system is formed, blockspace is conserved. It might go to $1, though that would represent a vast increase in demand.

Sure, right *now* miners are in it for the block rewards, and in a free market profit margins always tend toward zero so you will meet a lot of miners who can "barely stay in the game." This is how it works. Transaction volume has to grow in order for miners to get enough revenue on fees alone, and that can only happen if they are processing huge blocks - many years from now when the block reward has become small.

People keep saying hard forks are risky. Well instead of fearing them, why not put the infrastructure in place to make them unrisky? Simply being able to trade coins in one fork for coins in the other, on the exchanges, from the moment the fork happens, seems to be sufficient. 
The market will choose. Cheap talk is turned expensive, and the power of prediction markets makes the decision, distilling the wisdom of the community in the most accurate way. It should all be over in a few minutes. People just of course need to accept payment in both coins (5 BTC item requires 5 BTC from each fork) for those few minutes, so merchants need to be ready. Wallets could set up for this hard fork situation, to minimize friction even in those few minutes. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:14:30
Actually both chains could remain valuable in the highly unlikely situation that there actually needs to be a split, like into gold-like coin and shopping-coin. In that case the total value of your coins would stay the same (or actually increase, since we are assuming it was a necessary split so the market was wanting it), but in the case of for instance a 50/50 split your coins in each fork would be worth half what they were, though you could just sell your coins in the other fork* and end up with the same amount of money in the end, assuming you chose a fork that didn't later lose value. (If you want to be sure you don't lose anything, just sit tight and your wealth is preserve no matter which fork wins, or even if there's a permanent tie.)

It's a terrible idea for an attack at 20MB, but it's still a pretty bad idea even at 1MB, so I'd not rely on that argument to show the urgency of increasing the cap, but only to show that increasing the cap would not make that problem any worse (in fact better, as you say).

Indeed, the situation of "which direction do we wanna go from here?" only really gets interesting once we see what happens when blocks fill up enough that people are starting to feel the fee noose tightening - not just momentarily  but as a full-fledged economic consideration - and they start working on economizing and rightsizing their fees rather than the current "pay and pray" strategy (or sometimes the "might as well grotesquely overpay because why not?" strategy) when attaching a fee, and where miners start seeing $$ in their eyes at the extra income from fees. 
*Then* we can really debate the various proposals and be in a position where we can call each other ideologues and say the other camp wants to ruin Bitcoin or whatever :)

That's almost certainly a vast overstatement as I'll explain below, but the Bitcoin rich in general have the choice to keep their coins and live modestly, or they can spend them and live various degrees of lavish lifestyle. Only in the case where they keep most of their coins, thus making an extreme bet on Bitcoin's future, do they remain that concentrated. 
Also keep in mind those top 100 lists were made on data from several years ago. What most people do is sell off a large portion of their holdings as the price rises, which only makes sense. Normal people don't even keep their lottery winnings for more than a few years. And they certainly don't go from being middle class to multimillionaire (if they were to sell their coins) in a year and just shrug and say, "Let it ride, baby!" 
Anyone from 2010/2011 who wasn't already rich and who managed to hold onto more than a quarter of their coins has not only been resisting temptation at superhuman levels but continues to take tremendous risk. 
Also, people who have such a concern better not be the same people who have been doubting Bitcoin during this bear market, because that would blow up my irony meter.

Devs can keep deving for their unsuccessful ledger, but why bother? Even if they do, their every change will simply be copied into the spin-off. 
And there is no proven edge. If there were, it would already have been spun off. Once Bitcoin and Monero both get attacked by governments, we can find out if there is any need for what Monero offers...and then spin it off into Bitcoin's ledger.


No, because no altcoin has presented a worthwhile value proposition yet. Monero is closest, but it's all conjectural at this stage. The market can afford to wait - and should wait - until the last minute to do the spinoff.


There is not much blockchain first-mover advantage, there is mainly a ledger first-mover advantage. It makes absolutely no sense to do a spin-off on anything other than the biggest, most economically rational, most market-refined ledger. Even if Monero-the-protocol is 100 times as valuable as a concept than Bitcoin-the-protocol, it still gets spun off (or sidechained) because Bitcoin-the-ledger is far far more valuable than Monero-the-ledger.

Hi Greg, 
I've been opposed to a lot of what you say in the past as being narrowly code-focused (ignoring the broader economics and human factors adaptation), but what you said in this post really changes things. 
I think this is the angle you should take if you want to convince people of your side, because if it really is that quick to deploy an emergency fork (the fact that it was done before without a hitch is indeed convincing) and the idea that the sky won't fall if transactions get a bit delayed (contra Mike Hearn's post) but instead that motivation to economize and innovate will increase (this *is* taking into account human adaptation), then I am fine supporting your conservative position. Really the idea that blocksize caps can be bumped up slightly on an as-absolutely-needed basis changes everything. I think you would get a far better response with that angle.
I for one will change my position as far as "bigger cap now!" if it is confirmed through a bit more debate that what you've explained in this post is essentially true. And I think a lot of people will. I know your knowledge is broad and you can make all sorts of arguments, but focusing on these short circuits the other objections people have. That's an economization :)

Perhaps we can have it all, or perhaps we can't. Only the market can tell us to what extent we are maximizing our use of the presently-allocated blockspace. One argument to wait for blocks to fill up with "legit" transactions is to find that out and let the pressure force as much optimization as it can.

Using it and buying back gets the best of both worlds, as long as that usage is efficient for you (if it's not, you're just reducing the amount you can ultimately invest or increasing the rate at which you'll need to sell for daily needs...so spending pointlessly or just "to improve velocity" is counterproductive).

Note that I'm strongly for the blocksize increase, and ultimately removing the cap entirely. The purpose of my comment above was to keep everyone abreast of the skeptic objections so that the hard-won nuance of the debate over the past few days wouldn't start from square one again. If we come at the skeptics with the same arguments they have already responded to without addressing their responses, they may stop listening.


Insofar as that's the motivation, there is no commons in that sphere, but the OP's argument I quoted was implying a classic TOTC in that "hobbyists, devs and anyone who understands that nodes are important, will keep running proper nodes. Why? Without nodes Bitcoin is dead." (Note: TOTC is not itself a fallacy, and it shouldn't be an argument for central planning. As I said, eliminate the commons and the problem goes away. A commons is a sphere wherein property rights are not available, so enable rights, enable people to pay for what they use and others to get paid for providing their own private resources for their use.)


Fully agree.


Agree, though some skeptics are worried about the big-block attack, discussed below.


I tend to agree. It doesn't smell right. I'd like to see a full-on debate focused on this specific issue, as it seems to be the crux of a lot of the skeptics' ultimate fears (besides node centralization).


I agree, or at least my economist side finds this eminently reasonable. All arguments should be considered, but ultimately smallness is no defense. There is competition from altcoins to consider as well, limiting how conservative Bitcoin can afford to be.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:10:06
In practice miners would set their own limits for what they will accept, based on whatever everyone else will accept. So a kind of equilibrium of norms should form on its one. 
Of course you will object that it just takes a few miners to break the system by generating and accepting large blocks. But no, because 1) those blocks would be orphaned because no one else accepts them, and 2) even those few miners who would accept them would not want to build on them for fear of having what they built on top rejected. 


This speaks of "miners" as if they are a monolithic entity. Individual miners are what matters. Each miner may want to produce larger blocks, but they know others won't want to build on top of them (because THEY don't get the big fees). They have to weigh orphan risk against extra fees, and that is what sets the block limit. An economic limit rather than a hard-coded one. The system already seems perfectly set up to remove the limit.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:32:15
Breaking consensus is not *that* much of a problem. The most viable fork of the two will simply carry on. 
Even if they are split perfectly 50/50, that just means we have two Bitcoins, and if that happens that probably means there was a damn good reason for splitting into two. (So on this issue it probably won't.) 
People are prone to yap while the yapping's good, but when push comes to shove I think consensus on moving a ship left or right to avoid an iceberg becomes remarkable easy. Except, again, in Bitcoin going both left *and* right is actually an option, though an extreme one that would likely only be used once or twice ever, and most probably never.

Whitelisting/blacklisting is at its most malicious just another way of banning Bitcoin *in a particular jurisdiction* thereby cutting that jurisdiction out of the economic loop, and at its most benign just a pointless attempt that gets routed around. 
Governments can try to control whatever they want, but the WWL will squirm until the only way for a government to sort of control it is to ban it, which just shoots themselves in the foot. As with the Internet, eventually bureaucrats tire of seeing other countries get all the profits (and that juicy sweet tax revenue) the new technology generates.

OK, so why haven't you guys been focusing on this argument? Is it just that you get bogged down in addressing all the other points? Because it always seemed like the big unstated (or perhaps sometimes stated) premise of Gavin's proposal was that we need a lot of advanced prep and that big infrequent forks are safer than small frequent ones. 
Now that I think about it, a big fork far in advance to avoid emergency actually contains the seed for an emergency fork in the case where the change needs to be undone because some exploit is discovered. It seems there's no alternative making Bitcoin (the ecosystem) a forking ninja, dynamically able to change and revert quickly as needed. The need for reversion failsafes undoes the whole idea of "we only do big long-planned forks."

It's one of my favorite memes, because it shows how a mountain of absurdly good news has accumulated under the market's nose.

He sort of has. He said that it could be raised a bit when urgent, I guess after all other optimizations have been made. Gavin's idea seems to hinge on it not being feasible to rely on such sudden hard forks. If sudden hard forks are actually easy, then there can be no real concern about bad PR due to having to take days/weeks to roll out a cap increase while transactions stagnate*. This seems like a key point.
*Though I think some pretty simple changes in the fee market should ensure that transactions don't get delayed as much as simply increase in price for fast processing.

Sending on the old fork is not really "sending coins into the abyss," since you wouldn't lose them on the new fork. 
Anyway, you're basically arguing that instead of upgrading Bitcoin we should switch to many altcoins, and that Bitcoin is first but will be obsolete? The whole idea of altcoins is self-defeating, because upgrading to bran new ledger every time technology advances means there is no long-term value to any coin. Store of value is by far the most important function money performs. This idea that the ledger needs to be started anew whenever a better protocol comes along is seriously misguided and anyone who thinks this is going to miss most of the profits to be had in the crypto space.

Because that's the protocol. If you deviate from the protocol, you can have a system that has more than 21 million coins, but it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore, and likely no one else would use that deviated protocol. The name "Bitcoin" simply refers to following those protocol rules, including the 21M coin limit. You can follow whatever ruleset you like, but no one will call it Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-01 15:33:29
None of those things are necessary for Bitcoin to reach $1 million per coin. Just replacing gold as a store of value is plenty. The rest is entirely icing. The price being down needs no more complicated explanation than that it went up too far, too fast, and markets don't move in straight lines.
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:31:38
Well I think we can take some comfort in knowing, or at least being pretty sure, that if the 1MB cap does end up causing major delays and starts to substantially harm adoption and allow competitors to encroach on Bitcoin's market cap, the limit will be raised forthwith.

It's a strawman if you read it that way. Network effect is a very large and constantly growing moat, but I'm not aware of anyone arguing that it's completely insurmountable in principle. It's just that anything replacing Bitcoin would have to be hugely better, just as Bitcoin is hugely better than fiat (and more relevantly, gold).
Another important angle is that even if Bitcoin-the-protocol cannot be forked/upgraded to incorporate the necessary change, it can still be replaced without replacing Bitcoin-the-ledger. The only reason altcoins always start a new ledger is that the creators hope to get rich, and usually off of people who think Bitcoin is lacking in some way (or else why would they invest in the altcoin?). If you're releasing an alt-protocol with the specific intent of getting maximum adoption and getting as many bitcoiners as possible using it, the obvious move is to [distribute the coin proportionally to each BTC holder]( Switch out the protocol while keeping the WWL. Two-way pegged sidechains are another way of doing this.
@_date: 2015-05-07 16:09:00
That's mostly a strawman. I haven't seen any comprehensive argument that a higher blocksize cap means more centralization. By comprehensive I mean taking into account things like how it would affect the price and adoption rate, which are things that heavily affect how much someone is willing to invest in maintaining a full node, as well as how many people are available to develop solutions that could make Bitcoin even more decentralized. 
I have only seen arguments that it *could* mean more centralization, but I have also seen arguments that it could mean less. I don't see it as valid to assume from the start that the cap is helping decentralization.
It's perhaps no surprise that coders tend to focus on the code aspect, but Bitcoin's scope is much broader. Every decision heavily involves economics and financial incentives. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:21:19
Tim Swanson doesn't understand store of value and investment, which colors almost everything he writes. He looks at Bitcoin as a "currency" first and foremost, rather than a store of value and investment. This is why he started out an enthusiast and became a skeptic, and why he published so much analysis on transactions: he had a false idea that Bitcoin was just basically a better Paypal. It's primarily Gold 2.0; all else is built on that. Transactions will be an outgrowth of that once adoption has advanced greatly, but not yet - except niche uses.
Also, he incorrectly says the Wences Casares believes money arose from barter, which is exactly the position Casares goes out of his way to refute in many videos and in Xapo's own video explanation of what Bitcoin is, which covers this in depth. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 07:28:05
It's very high risk, very high return. If you believe that the return opportunities vastly outweighs the risk, i.e. that it's a high-expected-return investment, then two rules apply:
1) Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
2) Do invest what you *can* afford to lose.

Adoption would take a massive temporary hit. But then again we take a massive, "fatal" blow in the eyes of the mainstream every time a bubble bursts...but then a couple years later they're like, *And yet it moves...! 😲*
Bitcoin is alien technology, so far ahead of everything else out there in terms of its unique features (gold you can teleport!) that it will keep rising from the dead even after many snafus. Except of course the altcoins. Crypto will survive. The ledger may also survive (what are bitcoiners more likely to move to if Bitcoin were to somehow die? Litecoin or a spinoff that maintained everyone's addresses, private keys, and holdings). But the altcoins place an upper bound on how conservative Bitcoin can afford to be.
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:00:59

And someone could push him in front of a bus tomorrow. A lot of things could happen, but they generally don't unless it benefits someone. Besides, it wouldn't affect my interest in Bitcoin if someone shorted it down to single digits, nor if someone coerced several mining pool operators into performing double spends. That doesn't change anything about Bitcoin's prospects: we already know that it's still *possible* to attack Bitcoin at this early stage. If someone does, it will just make the system stronger. I'd welcome it.
Recently I've been looking at altcoins and I've realized  there is not even a candidate alternative to Bitcoin and PoW at this stage, and Bitcoin is so far ahead there probably never will be before Bitcoin hits mainstream. Proof of stake and all the other consensus methods bandied about are broken (or at best just become roundabout PoW systems) and no serious security researcher takes them seriously. It's PoW or nothing. 
So Bitcoin is it, and it doesn't even matter all that much if the ledger gets screwed up by a few double spends because *there is no alternative* for any of Bitcoin's mission-critical applications. There is no alternative to money you can store in your brain and cross borders with. There is no alternative to money people can use on the dark web. There is no alternative to the offshoring capabilities Bitcoin offers. 
Even a horribly messed up, constantly attacked Bitcoin where a risk of double-spends and extreme volatility were an ever-present threat (which I doubt because of antifragility) would still be used for these purposes because it's the only game in town. Sure, it won't be competing with ApplePay until it's much bigger and immune to such attacks, but we knew that already.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:57:54
You might be right that users grow 50%, but that means a lot more than a 50% increase in price. Metcalf's Law says the value of a network is proportional to the square of its nodes (some claim n * log (n)), and for money I would say there are additional network effects that boost that factor further. Something like 4x growth per year in the price on average is pretty close to the historical norm.

You always make good points in your posts, GSP, but I'm a puzzled that in this recent volley you seem to implicitly assume the 20MB raise is something more than a stopgap measure. I haven't heard anyone on the for side argue that it's the final solution. 
Ultimately we'll need something like Justus Ranvier's solution with no cap to ensure a rational price discovery for the resources in the system. The issue is simply to get a bit more leeway so as not to be caught with our pants down when the mainstream comes knocking.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:39:07
I think a a lot more devs would support a 2MB jump, especially if we wait3d for fees to rise for a time. And actually, just a small change would be very encouraging, because it would set a precedent.

Up 640x, down to 1/16. Up 100x, down to 1/6. The long-term track record of BTC holders is highly volatile but astronomically successful so it's always bizarre to see a skeptic bring up *price* of all things, since that is one of Bitcoin's most amazing achievements. The idea that "this time it's different and Bitcoin won't bounce back and head much higher" is fine to entertain IF there are specific arguments to support that notion.

No one is arguing for retaining the current cap, though.

A core dev should be very conservative. However, there is a limit to how conservative Bitcoin can afford to be in the face of competition from other platforms. We don't know how far each core dev's objections really go until we come down to the wire. Healthy risk-taking is necessary to avoid being overtaken.

@_date: 2015-05-31 19:06:59


Incorrect here. Owning 1 out of 21M bitcoins is the exact same as owning 2 out of 42M bitcoins. We speak of "bitcoins" for convenience, but what we really mean is "twenty-one-millionths of the ledger" or in this case "twenty-one-millionths of the combined ledger." Your holdings remain the same percentage of the combined market cap, which if both forks survive should be in the ballpark of whatever Bitcoin's market cap was.
As for the system working, you need some way to distinguish transactions between the forks, so that people can't just rebroadcast your transactions on both forks.

It rose and crashed even harder in 2011, and was dismissed and tarnished even more horribly, yet less than 2 years after that bubble top it came back to life and again exploded upward in spectacular fashion. People have short memories.
That said, a rebrand is a good idea. I like *blockchain shards* because it emphasizes that it's about having a percentage of the ledger, not a stupid "coin." It encourages correct thinking about what Bitcoin is. TBH I never liked the word bit (or the word bitcoin for that matter).

They can't stop it, they can only force a split into two systems (which, in the unlikely case that there really are hard and important tradeoffs, would be for the best). Someone will create a fork (or an identical spinoff altcoin using Bitcoin's ledger) with what the majority consider a reasonable increase when the network slows down, or when it is about to, and boom.

Yeah, that's actually a good question. I'm guessing it has to do with power draw and the size of the embedded chip being distributed through the different devices.

It's not just large amounts of transactions, but large-sized transactions in terms of value. The larger the transaction value, the more the recipient has to lose if it is double-spent. If Bitcoin is to be used for gold-like settlement say between central banks, the mining power has to be commensurate with the value of the transactions as well as the volume. (Though this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that you can usually wait for more confirmations for larger transactions. Most accurate may be to say, "It has the capacity to process transactions for large total amounts of value [per unit time].")

Many of these points have been debated with more subtlety already in threads over the past few days. In the interests of not having the level of debate move backward, here are some examples with short snippets of the more nuanced points raised:


[Tragedy of the commons]( Charity is not a sustainable model. Ultimately to eliminate artificial scarcity (blocksize caps) will require all resources in the network to be incorporated into [the price system]( The way to eliminate the tragedy of the commons is to eliminate the commons.


The skeptics would say that it's fundamental to the incentives of the *security model*, even though not to the market economics of the coins.


Bandwidth matters, too. Then there's the UTXO/RAM issue. 


Depends on the attack, though in general bigger network means higher BTC price, better funded and overall stronger.


The skeptic argument is that rogue miners creating huge blocks could put smaller miners out of business because they aren't able to keep up, but 1MB is too small to do this, whereas 20MB perhaps isn't. 


Yes, simply creating a lot of transactions with expensive fees is basically a donation to the miners, but also they would have to purchase BTC and push the price higher in so doing. Pretty weak sauce.


I haven't seen a good answer to this from the skeptics. Better the devil you have some grasp of than the devil that hasn't even been born yet.

That may be true of Mike, but what about Gavin? I don't think most here are on board with Mike's ideas, but Gavin...well I actually don't know that much about what he thinks on such things. If it turns out he really is all about "the Amazon shopping experience" and thinks decentralization is kind of silly in the end, then that would be a big revelation to many here and he would lose a lot of support.
However, I think it's also a big error to assume that most people are supporting Gavin specifically (some are); they more just want to see the network scale in the obvious way, especially since Satoshi never seemed to intend it to be permanent. A counterproposal for, say, a 5MB cap would probably get a lot of support, too, if any dev with clout seriously advanced it, blogged about it, etc.

You're just arguing for a fee market, which is exactly what will develop once blocks start filling up. I'm for increasing the blocksize, but it's a total illusion to think that we're making the most of the 1MB blocks yet. Without a fee market, efficiency is horrendous, but since blocks aren't full yet the market to make things more efficient hasn't developed, simply because there is no need to economize on block space yet.
The reason not to keep the 1MB limit is that there's no point in keeping fees *arbitrarily* high across the board, but fees do serve a valuable purpose in prioritizing transactions regardless of blocksize, and this fact makes the increase less urgent than it otherwise would be. There just needs to be a system for tracking bids and asks in the fee market from users and miners, respectively. Even a centralized system would be huge help. (Clients would need a failsafe max fee just in case the central API was compromised.)

Why don't miners just scale up fees automatically as blocks/mempool fill up?
There's this vague notion that fees should be set by the market, and of course they should, but it should be a constant second-by-second dynamic system where at any given moment a sender/wallet knows exactly how high to set a few to get it included in the next block, because miners are publishing that info in a feed. 
Why don't they do it now? Fees are that big a deal yet. Once there are more transactions (and bigger blocks) each block will have substantial fees and miners will want to maximize that by charging what the market will bear.

You can't get consensus from everyone, but you don't need to. 
The process is: 1) devs (or groups of devs) offer changes with the input of the public and key infrastructure, 2) the market chooses by buying or selling the coin, either to/from fiat, to/from other forks, or to/from altcoins. If there is a major lack of consensus at a critical juncture, there might be a fork into two systems IF the market supports it.

1) We are still at the talking stage. Consensus on whether it would be a good idea and how to do it is hard to get at this stage. It's a lot easier to get consensus when the fork seems like a foregone conclusion, when people are ready to make the best of whatever the result is, and especially when the change not being made is starting to cause major issues (like price crashes).
2) Consensus isn't even necessary, and I think we shouldn't really even want consensus for its own sake. A persistent lack of a consensus, if it includes people putting money where their mouths are and selling coins in the fork they don't like for coins in the one they do, is a strong indicator that there is actually a hard trade-off in Bitcoin that requires two Bitcoins from now on. Like maybe a somewhat more centralized, less inclusive Bitcoin with huge blocks, and a very decentralized Bitcoin with high fees. I happen to doubt the fears about large blocks, but I could be wrong. If the market decides to support both, I would defer to the market's judgment.

I love this debate. I used to wonder how smart and thoughtful the core devs really were, like "are they really top minds?" I now feel assured that they are.
 I also feel like Bitcoin will be fine with or without a blocksize cap increase for quite some time, and if I am wrong and the 1MB limits starts messing things up, I think we'll see a sudden breakthrough in consensus for at least a modest increase. (This is based on several of the devs' own statements.) That then sets a precedent and eases a lot of fears because we can study the effects.
So in many ways the consensus issue is self-correcting, just not until the last minute. There is often wisdom in not crossing bridges before you come to them, else you can create problems where none are needed. No dev wants to see Bitcoin die, be overtaken by an altcoin, or be relegated to some tiny unimportant niche. They aren't crazy caricatures, they're as far I can tell all extremely intelligent and level-headed folks. They're not trying to mess with your investment. ISTM the skeptics of Gavin's proposal mostly just want to follow the precautionary principle, at least until things come down to the wire. Note: I myself support way bigger blocks, and I'm on the fence about removing the limit completely and letting things play out, but I can totally understand wanting to see the network under strain first and with fees rising if you believe that an emergency hard fork could fairly reliably be implemented.
One last thing to note: if Bitcoin was already assured to overcome every hurdle in its path, the price would already be a lot higher. Scalability is one of those, so the fact that this debate is going as well as it is gives me a lot of confidence for the future.

The thing is, there is so little fee competition as it stands that it would take a lot of money to really stress the network IF fee competition became a thing. All we're really doing now with these stress tests is pushing on default behavior because miners aren't used to caring much about fees. Once there is enough transaction volume for fee prices to rise a bit and miners to start caring, they will do something about it: start accepting 1MB blocks instead of 750k, start providing fee price feeds or whatever, and allow a dynamic fee market to form. And wallets will start using that to let the user decide if they want to pay the price to get next-block confirmation. 
Infrastructural stuff like that. There's little incentive for that now just because there is little competition for transactions to be confirmed quickly. Sure, you can point to tx volume, but we can't know what fraction that volume would fall to if prices were a bit higher and free txs weren't tolerated anymore.
Once that happens I think we'll see that a stress test just adds a few drops to the bucket of the fee market and raises average fees for next-block confirmation slightly across the board, rather that causing any kind of delay that would actually interfere with business.

The value of the accounting units that constitute a money only needs securing if, as with a central bank or government, there is any chance for new units to be issued at the whim of some person or group within the economic community that is using the money (in this case, the Bitcoin community). 
Bitcoin won't make sense until you think of it as a distributed accounting ledger, which is all money ever was. Gold was an accounting ledger, with each nugget representing value given by the holder but not yet called back from the community. For example, you wash someone's barn in 1850 and they give you a little piece of gold. It's not that you wanted the pretty gold more than the 12 hours it took you to clean the barn; it's that this society has a *convention* where they use gold to keep track of who helped who. That makes the gold a lot more valuable than merely its decorative and industrial value. 
* Gold is effectively a primitive accounting ledger consisting of who holds how much gold (what proportion of the total supply) and is updated by physically passing those pieces of metal around. The scarcity of the gold ensures the ledger can't be cheated (except by physical theft of the gold).
* Bitcoin is a straight-up accounting ledger consisting of who owns what proportion of the total supply, and is updated by proof-of-work consensus. The scarcity of the bitcoin units ensures the ledger can't be cheated (except through discovery of someone's private key).

You mean that fact that there are few transactions? Small frequent transactions aren't Bitcoin's strong suit, even though some people have had the vision of on-chain microtransactions. It's more like a Gold 2.0 network for biggish transactions, growing in average size as the market cap grows. There are lightning network and other things can that deal with small frequent transactions. (I do think the blocksize should be raised, but replacing credit cards entirely on the blockchain seems a bit pointless.)

You're correct. Demurrage, block reward inflation, and minimum fees are all forms of self-destructing money. People don't realize that the 21M coin limit is nothing more than a token number. If, for example, you hold 1 BTC for one year then spend it, from your perspective "10% APR demurrage" = "10% APR block inflation" = "a 0.1 BTC fee on the transaction." They're identical.
Sure, the incentive structure shifts among those, with some incentivizing saving and some spending and some preferring large transactions over many small ones, but in the end it's all just deciding the effective mining subsidy. It's all deciding how much of your money goes to miners to pay for their services. 
The reason demurrage doesn't work is that, for example in your proposal, every 90 days people would find a reason to shift around their coins if anything could be gained at all. Wallets would be created that do this automatically, consolidating say monthly bills into 3-month lump sums, etc. So it would simply introduce friction. Besides, there need to be different fees for each kind of transaction (relevant to UTXO bloat: higher fees for UTXO-expanding transactions and maybe no fees for UTXO-consolidating transactions), so there is no "the same as you would have paid in mining fees" - it depends on how you would have spent them.

Another angle I haven't seen mentioned: if the logic of why miners won't perform 51% attacks is that they wouldn't want to damage the value of the coin they're mining, why wouldn't that same logic apply to too-big blocks? Why would miners not act in the interests of the network? Tragedy of the commons might play a factor, but then why would nodes relay the oversized blocks? 
It seems to me that miners who wanted to issue huge blocks would pay nodes for preferential relay. Voila, market limits, with node incentivization as a bonus as it is now profitable to run a beefy full node. I think this is essentially what Justus Ranvier proposes [here](

I think under market arbitrage (fork arbitrage or "forkbitrage"), the decision will be made in a matter of minutes, and maybe seconds. The reason is, well, there is money to be made if you are fast enough. Every trader who thinks the fork is a slam dunk will jump to sell coins in the old fork, even if they got there a few seconds late and they were already trading at 10% the value of the new fork's BTC. "A free 10% more bitcoins? Yes,  please!" Now maybe when it got down around 2% some traders would keep some old coins around just in case, but either way within seconds/minutes the decision is made. It's a wonderful result of how markets distill information, as well as how fast they can do it. 
Now in the unlikely event of an actual split where the old fork retains a significant market share, that would probably damage perception but it would only happen when the market truly deemed it an unavoidable split. And in fact, no, I take that back: if the situation were really such that the market supported a split, it should only be doing that if the market were concerned about the problem of *not* having that split (say for example an altcoin was rapidly eating Bitcoin's market share because it couldn't handle enough transactions per second, but it was also clear for some reason that max_blocksize should not be raised any further). Therefore the split should increase the market's valuation of Bitcoin (and treat the fork pretty well, too). This is sort of tautological in the sense that it's saying, "The market will like what the market chooses."

I agree with the sentiment that Bitcoin actually doesn't need to scale up at this time (because it's not exciting for Bitcoin to be [shopper's paradise]( contrary to popular belief), but also with the idea that bigger blocks would actually be fine (people will work it out), but also with the idea that a controversial hard fork in a non-emergency is silly. 
Maybe that's what Nick Szabo meant when he recently said that each side of the debate is overemphasizing the importance of its goal. 
What I think people don't realize, and I have only recently come to realize after a stint investigating altcoins, is that Bitcoin is the only game in town.

Sounds very reasonable, except Corallo transparently missing the point that fee markets still work with large blocks because the endgame (certainly by the time lower block rewards become an issue!) is to remove the limit and let the free market work anyway, where every resource used is paid for. It's just that it takes time for such market arrangements to form.
I would like to see how the fee market plays out when blocks get fuller, but that's mostly for educational purposes. The endgame is price discovery for *every* resource in the network.

Difficulty and price take turns rising. It is obvious that price drives difficulty. Difficulty, ceteris paribus, drives down mining profitability, which makes would-be miners divert their capital into investing instead of mining... which drives the price up. 
It's the mining cycle, and right now mining is in a massive bubble, whereas price is in a trough.

Tiny governments are good, if we go down to the family size and maybe extended family, maybe even up to very extended family. After that problems develop and we have to weight the cost of dealing with many tiny governments with the costs of huge governments. As technology develops, though, geography becomes less and less important so that large governments can and will weaken. So I think you are right that the pendulum will swing back toward decentralization.

Everyone should read Justus Ranvier's proposal to incentive full nodes:
Takes a while to get your head around, but the **TL;DR** as I understand it, is that we can expect miners to make paid arrangements with full nodes for preferential relay of their large blocks. That would solve node incentivization *and* remove the need for a blocksize cap altogether. It recouples the incentives that were uncoupled from Satoshi's original intention of having all miners be full nodes. Whether this requires actual code changes or whether it would somehow happen through market forces when scarcity hit (huge user influx, miners want that tx fee loot, miners start producing big blocks, nodes are too slow and miners lose the block reward, miners make deals with nodes) I'm not sure.

In a long-term bull market it is always a good time to buy. It's just that some times are better than others. Buying at $32 in 2011 was seen as a grand mistake, but actually if you held you'd be up several hundred percent right now. 
The real question is whether Bitcoin is the future. If it is, even $10,000 is a good time to buy if that's where the price happens to be. Consider in 2013 when the price returned to over $32. You could have said it was known that $32 is a terrible price, so you wait. Next month it's nearing $100. Still don't buy?

There ultimately need to be market incentives working to determine fees, block sizes, etc. I think the biggest problem is that Bitcoin, as far as mass-market a transaction system, is still kind of a toy in the sense that it isn't running into real scarcity issues yet in these aspects. Markets incentives and arrangements don't tend to form until they are needed. I personally think removing the blocksize limit completely would result in the rapid formation of such market arrangements, but there may be things we can do to avoid that happening under quasi-emergency conditions.

People accused the Blockstream-affiliated devs of opposing the blocksize cap increase because of the conflict of interest, but Greg said he has always opposed larger blocksize caps.

The result is that the conflict of interest claims loses a lot of its impact, but it can't be dismissed completely.

Could this eliminate mining pools, because miners wouldn't have to worry about variance anymore? 
EDIT: I was thinking of a strange idea: say you set your miner to only search for some limited set of the hash search space, like hashes that start with 1 after the leading zeros. If that makes sense, you could take out a hedge contract on some number of blocks not having that property, so that you could search ten times faster for any blocks that have that property, and if fewer than expected blocks have that property you get paid enough to cover it, reducing your variance tenfold.

That's like standing in a bucket and trying to lift yourself up by pulling on the handle. The attacker has to buy $4 million worth of BTC, pushing the price up, causing a very slight decrease in the network value. Meanwhile if Bitcoin is to succeed at all it continues growing exponentially on average, so this attacker is going to need a whole lot more than $4 million to even register on the price history, pushing the price up even more... The feedback loop is at best neutral, at worst (for the attacker), upward.

But it cuts both ways: what gigantic tsunami of money was flying into Bitcoin every day in 2014 to maintain the price in the mid-to-high hundreds?

This is just volatility. As a historical chart will show, this is far from the biggest downslide Bitcoin has experienced.

What is needed is to take advantage of all those situations where machines value rivalrous resources differently but are currently unable to trade. 
This currently leads to very wasteful situations where two machines are sharing a resource 50/50 even though Machine A needs it 10 times more than Machine B. What should be happening is the two machines should negotiate a price for the resource. Machine A would pay Machine B in exchange for getting to use a lot more of the resource. 
Owners of both machines win, without the owners having to explicitly authorize any trades with other owners. Total efficiency is greatly improved for everyone.

Actually it would only shave off an order of magnitude of value, so maybe 100K per coin instead of a million. Bad, but far better than what we have now where central banks can print whatever they want. 
Plus fractional reserve has no *raison d'etre* when you can store and transport coins anywhere near-instantly. It just takes one bank to start offering guaranteed reserves or even a limit on their fractional reservedness to start a price war among the banks. The problem isn't as much fractional reserve as monopoly. Absent monopoly, people will only tolerate fractional reserve if the interest rates are very high to compensate for the risk of a bank run.

It forces them to question their assumptions, shore up their arguments, find holes in their thinking. 
So far this isn't even the biggest drop Bitcoin has experienced, and it hasn't even broken the 10x-per-year growth trend (it went 10x above that trend in 2013 because it grew 100x that year, so it can easily go 10x below that trend by going to $100 around now for a while; if it stays for months below $100 the trend is arguably broken). 
If it goes below $50 for no good reason, that's when I start to question my assumptions about Bitcoin and investing. Until then it's all just noise when viewed in the light of Bitcoin's volatile history.

There is (or will be) actually a bit of a rush, but not just yet. What puts the rush on the change is an altcoin taking the excess transaction volume that becomes too expensive on Bitcoin. Imagine a big surge in adoption for some game like Bitcoin Billionaire. Maybe the game makers decide to switch to Doge just because their transactions are still cheap. Then what? Bitcoin loses market share. It's an emergency in terms of investment. People step up and optimize things a lot, but meanwhile the damage is being done. At some point the conservatism is too much of a millstone around Bitcoin's neck. At that time we'd better be ready to push out an emergency cap increase, at least a modest one.
There is a limit to how careful we can afford to be with blocksize limits, though I agree we should try all optimization options first, including the crisis-driven ones.

Their chart underestimates the growth, I think. Since most(?) vendors now list on all the major sites, the size of the bars is distorted simply by the number of major marketplaces in operation at each time. You can see that each time a major marketplace dies (SR2, Evolution) the other markets expand, but only a little since there is so much duplication.
A better analysis would try to go through and remove the overlapping vendors and listings. 
Also, just like people tend to trust the major markets more, it seems like people tend to gravitate toward the major vendors. The number of vendors and number of listings reveal nothing about the number of sales per vendor, nor the size of those sales.

Perhaps you aim to know something like, *How many "actually important" transactions are happening and how many are just trivial ones we could price out of the market by raising fees a bit?* 
The answer can't possibly be known, just like we cannot possibly know what the price of butter in Sweden should be in October. It all comes down to supply and demand, how much people want to use the 1MB blockspace as reflected by how much they are willing to pay for it during a given hour, and also how much they are willing to pay to use it urgently. 
We cannot know what price the advertisers would be willing to pay. We cannot know how much the ads would quiet down if more people used the network and drove up fees, though probably it would be a significant quelling. But perhaps they would continue as of nothing, because they viewed their ads as important and beneficial beyond even the new higher market clearing price. That's for the market to decide. 
Most likely, though, most of the transactions are spammy by some popular subjective definition, and from that view there is a great deal of optimization that could be done within the current blockspace (that doesn't mean blocks shouldn't be allowed to increase, but it suggests there is not nearly as much urgency as a pure extrapolation of the data would suggest).

Bigger blocks may hinder decentralization, or they may help it. The bigger Bitcoin grows, in many ways the harder it is to kill it. I don't buy the automatic assumption that larger blocks mean more centralization. 
On the other hand, I also don't buy the assumption that 1MB blocks would slow down mainstream adoption appreciably, at least not at this stage, because this is still the investment stage. Bitcoin can reach trillion dollar market caps just by replacing gold as a store of value. That will take bigger than 1MB blocks eventually, but not giga-blocks. 
And most of all, if we can adjust little by little through a series of smaller hotfix forks to bump up the blocksize cap, there is not much concern that a big surge in adoption would catch the network totally off guard and unable to keep up.

It's a good thing, but the idea that block rewards represent a "loss of value" if there isn't enough transaction volume is a myth that I'm tired of seeing quoted. 
It's true that the block rewards are paying to disincentive double-spends through 51% attacks, which means the rewards are going toward securing the transactions, but it doesn't follow that the cost of a transaction is "25 BTC divided by the number of transactions in a block." 
To see why, consider the situation where Bitcoin is adopted by all central banks instead of gold. They hardly ever make any transactions; most blocks are empty, only a few transactions happen each week. So, following this fallacious line of reasoning that the block reward goes solely to pay for the transactions, as I've seen Vitalik Buterin and Tim Swanson also echo, the central banks decide to lower the block reward so that it makes the transaction fees reasonable, something like 0.01 BTC per block.
Of course this blows up in their faces because the mining falls off so much that someone 51% attacks the network and pulls off some double-spends, causing the value of their coin to plummet on the market. Goodbye store of value. 
The moral: At this point the block reward goes mainly toward maintaining the store of value, not mainly toward "paying for the transactions." The store of value function is [pretty darn valuable](

As long as "pants down" means mild inconvenience or interruption of some of Bitcoin's less important utility, rather than long-term network gridlock (or unworkably high fees) forcing a mass diversion into an altcoin that is less risk-averse. Since there is a limit to how conservative Bitcoin can afford to be in the face of altcoin competition, I don't put much stock in "ensuring total safety," but rather taking only the most prudent risks necessary to avoid being overtaken.

Pain, visual effects, sounds, smells, and other raw sensory phenomena don't need to be (and when precision is required probably shouldn't be) defined in terms of other words, but rather by inducing the phenomenon for the listener and uttering the word. Sort of like pointing to the moon and saying "moon." The person might think you mean sky or stars, or even air, but that can be clarified with more examples. Nevertheless there is, at least in this raw sensory realm, no problem of every word just being defined in terms of other words. The buck stops with specification of direct sensory experience.
Now if you follow and agree so far, there is a second part to the argument: that every notion (every conscious thought, every experience) is ultimately composed of raw sensations. That is, sensations of what we call the five senses. This is much harder to see, but with some careful explanation I think most people could be convinced. 
Taken together, assuming those two arguments are convincing to the reader, there is really no problem of words being just defined in terms of other words in a "it's turtles all the way down" fashion. Eventually we get down to raw sensations in the first person phrasing and we are done, albeit granted this can be quite difficult to do because it requires seeing the exact nature of things, added to the fact that words in everyday talk are too vague to presume to choose an exact sensory referent for them. In principle it is doable, though, and it is worth doing in some cases. 
TR;DR: Clarity in communication is not a lost cause, just a lot of work (at least in normal verbal language).

$120 is fair game. Bitcoin is often thought to rise about 10x per year, but of course this is on average and the volatility can be a real mindfuck. In 2012 it was around $10, so by the trend it should have reached around $100 in 2013 and around $1000 in 2014. So it was an order of magnitude above the trend at the end of 2013 when it reached $1200. 
Therefore it shouldn't be especially surprising to see it an order of magnitude below the trend now, which means roughly $100. According to the trend, $1200 in 2013 was a strong sell, and $100 now is about an equally strong buy. We see roughly symmetric sentiment as well: OMG IM RICH!! TO THE MOON!!!! vs. OMG IM BROKE!! BITCOIN IS DEAD!!!!

I don't think he got into this just to double or triple his money. That's not how venture capitalism works. 10x gains would be the minimum aimed for, and in this case probably a lot higher, so "recovery" would mean at least $1000 for starters,and it wouldn't be much of an issue if it dipped down first. 
You don't get 10x or 100x returns without major volatility, so to be sensitive to the price halving a couple times wouldn't make sense. This kitchen is hot, and everyone knows it. They got in knowing they might have to withstand some heat in the short term.

Not a valid assumption, even if "everyone knows" it. In fact, the core devs arguing this way are using economic arguments even though they are not economists and we have no reason to think they're especially good at economic reasoning (it was Satoshi who needed that skill; the core devs haven't changed the basic economic design). 
The adoption enabled by bigger blocks would drive the price higher and incentivize all sorts of things that could increase decentralization, most obviously the fact that each BTC holder would be more likely to have the affluence to run a full node themselves, but also things like ASIC commodification, 21's efforts, and more coders jumping in and finding solutions. It's not a cut-and-dried issue.
However, I think this is all moot if we can just fork in many small increments with only a few hours' notice when needed. Then we can continually and dynamically choose how much we want to prioritize decentralization in the face of adoption.

Several hundred million per coin seems more sane. After all, it's not like Bitcoin would simply take over all the existing uses of money and capital markets. To think that way would be like estimating Uber's ultimate valuation as merely the size of the worldwide taxi industry, or imagining that the Internet will only help cut costs in that it will save paper from letters and faxes. It will create value for the world in ways we can't even imagine yet. We're stuck thinking about the equivalent of replacing fax machines, when what's coming is things like facebook, iPhones, Google Maps, and, recursively, Bitcoin.
And that's not even taking into account the effect of things built on top of Bitcoin, like prediction markets, that could vastly increase efficiencies across the board. It's silly to just look at the "market cap" of the entire world and map Bitcoin onto that. A Bitcoin-powered world would be providing orders of magnitude more value to civilization, similar to how the Internet and computer revolutions did (or will, once they spread to every corner of the globe).

Talk is cheap. The forks should be arbitraged on the exchanges and we'll see if they put their money where their mouths are. In the unlikely event that many people do sell BTC in the new fork for BTC in the old fork, that probably means there was actually a need for two versions of Bitcoin. That would be quite a thing, but it's not impossible. 
I think it's far more likely that these people will simply go along with it and that the old fork will become worthless. If they can't sell their coins for those in the old fork, what will they sell them for? Fiat? Altcoins, which are even worse stores of value? Unlikely. There aren't a lot of options out there.
Besides, even if the hard fork results in a sharp sell-off, that is better than making it impossible for the price to ever rise beyond a certain level because mass adoption cannot happen.

Hey wait, you're right: blocks will only get suddenly big in a "sudden success" scenario for Bitcoin. So having a cap is a way to guarantee the system slows down right when adoption hinges on it not slowing down. It's like success-proofing.
To be fair, the objection is that the influx of users could overwhelm and destroy the network, which would be even worse. However, I'm not so sure there is much difference in the level of fail between these two outcomes. It's just that with the blocksize cap the fail is guaranteed.

Of course it doesn't make sense for brick and mortar stores to accept Bitcoin right now (except rare situations).

As those spread, and as investment interest spreads, use for remittance spreads, use for evading capital controls spreads, black market use spreads, things like 21 roll out, things like Align and Circle expand, etc. there will be a lot more people who are paid in BTC and would find it most convenient and cheap to pay in BTC for any old thing.

Altcoins today are synonymous with alt-ledgers. Bitcoin needed to start a new ledger, because it was the first crypto. Alternative protocols/chains have no need to do that. They can just use Bitcoin's ledger. The reason they don't is because they want to get rich off the pump and dump. 
You will object, "My altcoin has long-term value because Bitcoin cannot be forked to incorporate its properties." But you miss the subtlety that the Bitcoin *protocol* doesn't need to be forked in order for the Bitcoin *ledger* to incorporate those properties. IF your altcoin proves useful enough, someone will just fork your altcoin into a spin-off (or sidechain) that distributes its coins proportionally to Bitcoin holders.
 
Why hasn't this been done yet? Because there are no decisively compelling altcoins! Monero is the only one that *may* have something to offer, but since it has never faced the threat it is designed to protect against (de-anonymization) there is no way to know if it is truly a better option than Bitcoin+CoinJoin. It's all theoretical so there is no point in creating the spin-off yet. Might as well wait until there is a definite compelling use case.
Altcoins can have no long-term investment value. If they gain traction, they get spun off into the Bitcoin ledger, killing your investment because now it is not your protocol versus the Bitcoin protocol, but your ledger vs. the Bitcoin ledger. Even if your protocol is better, is your ledger better? Has it had many years of [extreme market refinement and rationalization]( The real killer network effects are in the ledger, not the protocol!
Besides, as soon as you accept the notion that underlies all altcoins, i.e. that "every time a better protocol comes along we need to start the ledger anew," you must by the same token accept that your altcoin investment can have no long-term value since a better protocol will inevitably be created and everyone will jump to that, complete with a new ledger leaving you high and dry. 
Long-term investment in altcoins is therefore a self-defeating concept. The very logic of their investment proposition - that new protocol means new ledger - already entails that they are pump-and-dumps, because protocols will never stop improving.

You're spreading two myths here: that block rewards are part of tx costs (they are almost entirely store-of-value costs, not to mention that Bitcoin is still mostly an investment and these "costs" were baked in and known to all investors in advance), and that miners hold all the cards. Miners don't hold very many cards at all: users can switch to altcoins, investors can sell off the miners' chosen fork. Investors hold the ultimate trump card, and investors look to user activity to identify where the value is. Miners exist at the pleasure of these two groups.

Cops could still do it, but it's much harder to hide in an audit and you need a lot more - and more constant - cooperation from everyone involved, plus you can't change your story on the fly.

To me it all rides on the question of whether we can "upgrade on the fly" in a success scenario. If we can, and if there is massive opposition among the dev team to an increase before that time comes, then it seems better to just wait until it is urgent, or maybe phase it in slowly. Clogged pipes shouldn't happen in a free fee market; just gradual increase in fee costs, which I really don't think is the end of the world, especially if we can quickly hotfix.

In economics this situation is called "zero-sum" where your gain is another person's loss. Some things are zero-sum, but many are positive sum, meaning that you gain while someone else gains, too. It's case by case. All economic transactions are positive sum at the time they were executed, *from the point of view of each party at the time*. However, in investment the market value of something you sold to someone may go up or may go down, afterward, so that later on you are glad you made the trade and the other person regrets it, or vice versa.

Doesn't matter, because the unit value is arbitrary. 
"I hold 1 BTC" is just another way of saying "I hold one 21-millionth of the entire money supply that will ever exist on the ledger." Forking doesn't change that. You still hold exactly one 21-million of the entire money supply, no matter how the ledgers split and how much each fork is valued at. For example an 80/20 split still leaves that statement true, and retains your entire investment value. And in fact, if splitting into two systems was the market's choice, it means the market was wanting that and the total value should be evaluated more highly by the market after the change.

The question is whether it really takes a year to roll out the change, and also if it would take less than a year to roll out a smaller change, and additionally if it would take far less time than that if there were an imminent threat to adoption due to small blocks.
If indeed the infrastructure were set up so that a small increase could be made in a few hours during a quasi-emergency, and if a fee market could limit the degree of such emergency to "temporarily expensive to get fast confirmations," fork-in-small-steps-as-needed starts looking really attractive, especially when you consider that a large increase fork *could* require an emergency hard fork to revert the change anyway in case an exploit is found. 
Fork-o-phobia seems self-defeating. Isn't this what actually underlies the logic for one big increase? We need to be able to hotfix on demand (doesn't mean we will do it lightly or arbitrarily, since consensus couldn't be achieved for anything but an obviously required change).

There's no need to presume what users want. It will be decided on the market which fork is more valuable. For any widely supported change that seems very innocuous, probably the old fork will fall to less than 10% of the new fork's value almost instantly on the exchanges, having set themselves up to deal with this situation in advance. I think it will be a lot smoother than people think.

It can be useful at any particular price, but the uses diminish vastly at low prices and increase dramatically at high prices. High prices make it way more secure by motivating people to mine and build out infrastructure, which in turn enables people to use it for storing and transporting much larger amounts of money, which pushes the price up further. It's a virtuous spiral.

I think this shows that the blocksize wait-and-see crew is right about one thing: the economization that happens via miners setting various policies and soft limits and fee prices when blocks get full is a necessary step in the antifragile process of adaptation within the ecosystem. 
However, the argument that this should happen *before* an increase of the blocksize cap rather than after remains questionable. In other words, it seems that economization norms and pricing and best practices are going to form as needed anyway, so what is the additional argument that this should happen at 1MB first rather than at 20MB?

Actually there is no one who thinks this on the core dev team, as far as I can tell. 
The reason for wait-and-see is not to keep Bitcoin the same, but to measure the effects, put pressure on needed things like fee markets and other optimizations of blockspace, and grow organically. I happen to disagree that the a *hardcoded* cap is needed for that, since an economic cap should form on its own, but I can see the reason to default to conservatism. Especially when you believe, as it seems many of the core devs do, that an emergency increase wouldn't be a big risk if it were needed. It may be that this final point is where the pivotal difference lies, with Gavin wanting to plan one year in advance and other devs seeming to say that hours/days/week is plenty for an urgent fork given past experience with forks. (It is true that consensus becomes much easier when the alternative is watching something break.)

Not that I agree Ver is a sociopath. He's a principled person, and being a principled person is hard. Sometimes you end up doing odd things because you think in terms of ideals.

This stood out as the strongest argument:


The community and its number of wealthy participants grows as usage grows. Whatever the measure of decentralization is, simply expanding the number of participants while keeping the "concentration" the same (which one may be tempted to call "keeping the level of decentralization the same") actually increases decentralization. 
Like if you take something that looks like [this]( and just expand it, even if it retains the same amount of "decentralization" in terms of shape it will be more effectively decentralized because it's more spread out in an absolute sense. Even if it were to concentrate slightly in shape, it becomes more decentralized in the way we need it to be, in that more nodes would have to be compromised to attack it.

Miners will just mine whichever coin is more valuable. Exchanges need a way to let people arbitrage the forks. This probably requires a way to make transactions different between the two chains, otherwise the recipient of your spend on one chain can just push the same tx to the other chain and get your coins on the other chain as well. I guess that means hard forks require a change in how transactions are signed.
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:47:49
No, because the fees - which would have to be hefty - will mostly go to other miners (unless you have more than 50% of the hashing power, in which case you get at least half back), so you'd have to collude with other miners. But then that is just a roundabout way of colluding to raising fees (with the added expense and uncertainty of shuffling money around among the colluders). Miners can already collude to raise fees, so you may as well ask why that doesn't happen.

3TPS is about 100 million transactions per year. This amazing attack raises the average fee by $0.25, and with 20MB blocks it's more like 1 cent. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains perfectly usable and grows as it would otherwise, just very very very slightly slower. Except that mining is being subsidized as well, so the network is even more secure, driving the price higher if anything. 
This attack would be about as effective as a dog chasing its tail.

Bitcoin the protocol or Bitcoin the ledger? From an investment perspective of course current holders would not want to move to a new ledger, besides which it would set a terrible and irrational precedent: that investors would lose all their money whenever a new and better protocol came out. Current investors generally would probably not mind updating/improving the protocol when such an update becomes compelling, but starting from a new ledger doesn't fly.
This is why long-term investing in altcoins as they exist today is a self-defeating concept. If it were true that the market accepted switching ledgers every time an improvement came out - if you buy that premise - you have to also acknowledge your long-term investment will be going to zero in a few years when some improvement inevitably comes along. As goes the goose, so goes the gander. 
Rather, the ledger can be preserved even if a whole new protocol and whole new blockchain needs to be introduced, via the spin-off technique where each holder's private keys are allowed to unlocked exactly the same percentage of the money supply in the new system. Replacing the ledger every time the protocol needs to be replaced upends the whole concept of store of value, which is the primary significance of the invention and the foundation of all the other applications.

As long as we can just gradually add block space through a series of small-increase forks I don't see the problem with conservatism. The argument for the 20MB fork is that if transactions suddenly spike for some reason we will be caught with our pants down and take a long time to upgrade, causing a PR nightmare. The key question is would it really take long to implement a small-increase fork under such circumstances? If not, there's no point to an all-at-once 20x fork.

With [spin-offs]( you can have both. If you have 2% of all the BTC, you will automatically have 2% of all the spinoff XMR. Then you can use your money in either or both as you please. Even if everyone sells all their remaining BTC to zero for XMR, all current BTC investors who just sit tight retain all their wealth. The ledger is maintained, even as the protocol switched. 
You can call it Monero or call it Bitcoin, all that matters is the ledger is unchanged. The market determines to what extent each protocol is favored. As an investor, you need not choose sides.

Not a matter of opinion, but a matter of cost would be the way to have it I think. A node can refuse to relay a big block if it isn't paid for, and then sure another node can relay that block for free if it wants to, but once nodes are businesses trying to cut costs they won't run like a charity anymore. Even though charity nodes will likely still exist, they will fill up quickly and miners not lucky enough to get their blocks relayed by those nodes will be forced to pay some price to a node for relay.


But if most of the network refuses blocks over a certain size because they are expensive to process, then wouldn't it be better if it was the ones who process the oversized blocks that would be out of sync? (I realize this may require a change in protocol rules.)

If and only if one chain becomes too bloated would it be useful to have a second chain (though probably a sidechain). But since that issue is entangled with the scalability issue, it doesn't really make all that much sense to refer to it explicitly here.

This is confused. Bitcoin is not a democracy; it is control by the market. There is no "one man, one vote" in Bitcoin. 
The protocol can and will be changed when the market demands it. Even if that means changing the 21M coin limit. Oh, does that sound scary? It's not. The market would never allow such a thing. Bitcoin is Marketcoin, not Satoshicoin or Gavincoin or CoreDevcoin. If the protocol as it is "hardcoded" ceases to bring value it will be forked and the low-value fork will be sold off in favor of the high-value fork. 
So sure, it's "hardcoded" but the ledger can just switch to a different protocol so that is not as meaningful as it seems.

Wallets should have some kind of warning system for if a hardfork has occurred. That way, no matter how you are checking the balance of your receiving address (whether by your wallet or by blockchain.info, etc.) you get the warning that there are two forks and to demand payment in both (or in your favored fork).

Not nastiness. That is perfect. The old (or new!) fork dies because it has no value in the market and no one mines it. It would likely be over within seconds anyway. There is no "Gavincoin," only Marketcoin: what the market gives value to. Bitcoin is whatever the market decides, not whatever Gavin decides, even if he was the one to proposal the change.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:05:41
And miners generally mine only what is profitable, which means it's really [investors]( that determine which fork survives. (For best results, exchanges need to add the ability to sell coins in one fork for coins in the other. Within seconds, or maybe minutes, the disfavored fork should be trading at well below Dogecoin's market cap, which I think is pretty definitive.)

Well that's a reasonable opinion. But it doesn't seem you are against the increase per se, just that you want more testing. However, if this is the criterion then it seems Gavin is also a skeptic in that he is not pushing for an immediate increase but just for scheduled increase a year from now. To me that implies doing as much testing and debate as possible until then, and cancelling or delaying the increase if it is deemed unworkable or not tested enough yet.

The average user will *never* run a full node at home. Not even when it's trivial to do so. Because the average user simply doesn't care, and that will be all the more true as adoption spreads. Charity is not a sustainable model, no matter how easy it becomes. Average users don't work for free. Only a vanishingly small percentage ever will. Scaling ultimately requires price discovery for all resources in the network. That end can only be reached with much higher levels of usage, which for now requires at least a modest increase in blocksize.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:22:01
It's true that we cannot rely on altruism. It's not sustainable. 
However it seems to me that the reason nodes aren't getting paid for their services is precisely *because* of the blocksize cap. In other words, the cap is causing two problems: it limits scalability and it prevents full nodes from getting paid like they normally would if miners were able to push through big blocks by paying nodes to relay them. 
This dual problem presentation smells like a hampered market. For example, price controls result in both shortages and arbitrariness in service prioritization. (I believe this idea originated with Daniel Krawisz and Justus Ranvier.)

Now for what goes into the "reference" client or the "official" version, there can be voting among those groups, or not, but here the market has the final say as well. It's just a matter of how the changes offered to the market by those currently known as the core devs will be determined.

If this is the takeaway from the stress test, then 20MB or even 200MB blocks will not really do much to prevent such attacks, as you'd only need 20 or 200 dudes (more likely just one or two dudes with a lot of resources). If anything, this makes the opposite point: the real need is to economize blockspace using a proper fee market and whatever else we can think of, because blocksize increases themselves buy precious little protection against such attacks. The key is it needs to be expensive to attack the network, and furthermore it has to be progressively more expensive to attack it harder. This requires a more transparent and sophisticated fee market than the current "pay and pray" model, and while we have had plenty of time for such a market to form, it simply hasn't because there's been no incentive for that. 
EDIT: That doesn't mean we need a hardcoded cap, but it does mean we need some kind of cap - even if a purely economic one - to run up against before fees will be rational and before this kind of stress testing will mean anything.


Everyone's for increasing block size. And even if we limit it to Gavin's proposal, there are no famous counterproposals yet to point to. If, for example, some other core dev proposed a 5MB cap and got one or two others to stand with him, a bet a lot of people would go for that one. Maybe even more than for Gavin's. Make sense?


I agree, we should. But that doesn't take away from the reasoning in someone's argument if it is valid, it only gives a reason to go over it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure it is.
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:47:33
I think a lot of people are neglecting the fact that Gavin merely wants to *schedule* an increase for next year. It could always be canceled before it happens, so it's not like anything gets "locked in" at this stage.

It's just that Satoshi was the one who added in the blocksize cap, and even he regarded it as temporary. Insofar as there are people who do regard Satoshi's decisions as "canon," there is reason to point this fact out. However, of course it doesn't matter. Bitcoin isn't Satoshicoin, Gavincoin, or anyone's coin. If anything it is Marketcoin, because the market ultimately decides which fork has value (and hence relevance). 
@_date: 2015-05-07 19:26:40
Because in a price system there would be an economic blocksize limit, even if there isn't a hardcoded one.

The worry is that a user (e.g., a merchant) would unwittingly accept coins on the old fork as payment, only to find they are worthless and the buyer never had to spend any of the new fork coins.
This can be avoided by having all wallets and services automatically notify the user when there has been a hard fork. Even if someone only uses a cold wallet and accepts payment to it, they have to use some means to check the balance - whether that's a watch-only wallet in their client or just checking on blockchain.info. Everywhere they look, there should be a big warning that a hard fork has occurred, and that payment should be accepted only on the preferred fork (users can of course just demand payment on both forks if they're not sure, and that situation should only last a few minutes as the market arbitrages the disfavored fork to zero).

I think there looks like more contention than there is. For example, anyone who is conservative may default to not raising even if they think it would *likely* be a good idea. They may hold this wait-and-see position until things start breaking. "If it ain't broke (yet), don't fix it." 
Peter Todd and Matt Corallo seem like the only prominent devs who are solidly opposed, with the rest having various flavors of conservative reservations or skepticism until more testing can be done. Even Gavin could be called a skeptic in the sense that he's proposing the change for a year from now, meaning there is plenty of time to revise or cancel it.

Absolutely if we had proven methods of scaling without raising the blocksize limit, there would be no point to hard forking over it (even assuming the limit is a useless relic). The point is that these scaling methods are not proven, and we're running out of time before small blocks start causing delays, which would be disastrous if a bubble hit. Buying some time to test out these solutions is exactly what's needed.

Nerds aren't known for sticking their necks out in public. I sense even Gavin  has had some growing pains or identity issues getting into that role. It's far safer (socially) to critique. 
However, they've all probably made various proposals on mailing lists and random forum comments. It's just that they're not *championing* them and putting them in people's faces.

Nice post. Just one nitpick: 


Taking this too far just lets an altcoin take away some of Bitcoin's market share. It's essential that the cap be raised at least somewhat if there's enough congestion to drive fees up to exorbitant levels on an ongoing basis, but then again I think most/all core devs are on board with at least a modest increase given such a scenario, as you mentioned at the end:


I think this is what we are seeing now. Gavin's proposal probably wouldn't be the slam dunk end of Bitcoin even in the eyes of most core devs (devs please correct me if this is wrong). It's just that Bitcoin doesn't change until tradeoffs are maximally crystallized, and that often means an urgent situation. That might seem scary, but think of the alternative: shooting in the dark. Sure we'd done all kinds of testing and calculations, but there is no substitute in such or an organic system for a real market reaction. 
We may find that all sorts of optimizations occur when fees are elevated, and we end up having ten times as much usable space as we thought, the former proponents of 20MB blocks are happy with 2MB, which a lot more people could get behind. Might even be fine with 5MB, which in that case would be like 50MB under current extrapolated models. 
Or maybe we find it's a total clusterf*ck that no one would ever want to risk repeating and sets Bitcoin back a few years, so people say screw it, let's just increase to 100MB in a series of steps and hope it works out. 
There is no crisis, and that's..... BAD :)

I think the sticking point for many people is that we don't really know. Court cases and procedures are partly opaque and mystical/counterintuitive to the layman, plus there's the fundamental fact that we're relying on what agents of the state are saying was written in a file on a computer they had prior access to, and we're talking about people who fundamentally distrust the government. Not to mention that two agents, though in a different part of the government, ended up being corrupt (allegedly, to be fair). "What else don't we know?" is a lingering thought that there's no way to fully chase away. 
I personally wouldn't want to defend Ross myself on those charges, because I know he might one day personally admit to them just because he knows it won't make a difference or something, and then that brings possible bad rep to me. I will only go as far as to say we should reserve judgment. 
I could certainly see him doing it, and having it all be justified in his mind as collateral damage given that the people he wanted killed were going to cause many other people to be incarcerated, etc. given the realities of the current statist society, so there is a kind of utilitarian "[trolley problem]( calculus to it where some libertarians might at least be able to see how a young idealist could end up falling into thinking that would be an unavoidable measure in the heat of the fight and drunk on the heady feeling of power and mission, on top of the "unreality" of doing everything over the net. I suspect that's part of it, too, although I can't really sympathize on that point myself.

What happens when Bitcoin changes just slightly to make it easier to take advantage of the fundamental fungibility of UTXO to make it trivially easy to remain anonymous (it's already fairly easy)? Meanwhile it's not even known whether Monero is truly anonymous. It's never had a market test. It's not used in transactions yet.
I do agree that Monero is the best and most viable altcoin, though. Shapeshifting through it just gives added reassurance of anonymity.

Grinding transaction histories (NaS) is more complicated an attack than 51% so it will take longer for people to figure out how to perform it, but the situation is that both the honest nodes and the attacker are in the dark until some future date when an attack may be found. With Bitcoin, no one is in the dark as to what would be required in order to pull off an attack. Complexity makes the attack harder to find for a while, but also leaves the network helpless once it is found. It's a ticking time bomb. 
That's why so many variations on PoS have been thought up. However, they all miss the core point that a more complex resource-expending attack is only a delaying tactic, not a final defense. The more complex, the more totally in the dark everyone is. Once the market cap grows high enough, the tides goes out and the attack vectors are revealed and it becomes a free for all.

Overlong article that, besides the ECDSA points, simply pouts that it sucks that PoW costs so much in time and resources, and expresses a vague sentiment that "there must be another way." Somehow this morphs into a position of near-certitude at the end, as if this increase in conviction was somehow justified by the sheer length of the article, where nothing of substance was put forth except cute (and admittedly interesting) asides about the history of invention and murky feelings that "others might find a better solution."
@_date: 2015-05-07 18:12:39
The raise mostly just buys time. The endgame, at least as I see it, is to remove the blocksize cap completely, but in order to remove that artificial scarcity every resource that is scarce in Bitcoin network needs to be incorporated into the price system, or else we get tragedies of the commons. This might happen automatically in ways that are hard to predict (market solutions usually are), but it would be more reassuring if it happened gradually with testing and such.

Raising prices doesn't make revenue go up, or at least not for very long.

And in so doing they attract more total users and more total fee revenue even though each fee is smaller.

@_date: 2016-06-30 02:21:57
This oft-repeated glib handwave ignores the fact that what constitutes the "appropriate fee" can become radically unknowable during surge times when there is a hard blocksize limit, especially as people become aware that surge times require specially high fees. There really needs to be flexibility in the cap. Either some kind of flexcap or substantially bigger blocksize cap for overhead space. The idea of just having a hard ceiling, besides being new economics, is just not well thought out.

Yes unfortunately this is a consequence of the ICO. See, the ICO gave devs their wish: become a hugely funded entity with a lot of power. As a result, their recommendation that it is impossible to lose money in TheDAO was headed almost universally, and many people invested every last ether into it. 
That means a bunch of Ethereum supporters have zero financial interest in any path for Ethereum that doesn't involve an undo of TheDAO. If Eth goes to the moon following a path of neutral transaction enforcement, their moon ticket is lost and they get to watch from the sidelines as their fellow etherites bedeck themselves with gold chains in their Lamborghinis. This is why the pushback is so strong.
It's one of the subtler points of why you don't do ICOs, and why premines are toxic to a coin long term.

This the old argument that treats 1MB as a magic number. Even granting other scaling will definitely be needed, if the ideal blocksize cap is, say, 10MB, keeping it at 1MB is forfeiting an order or magnitude of scaling we could have *for no reason*. Much as if 1MB turned out to be - very seredipitously - the ideal, keeping it at 100kB would be forfeiting an order of magnitude of scaling for no reason. 
Furthermore, this is scaling we could have *right now*, which is critical for building Bitcoin's network effect moat against competitors and setting in motion all manner of infrustructure buildouts a higher market cap and tx volume could allow for. Ironically this entails a lot *more* decentralization and general robustness, just as would increasing the blocksize cap from 100kB to 1MB.

What is your definition of spam?
@_date: 2016-11-15 19:49:14
I see what you are saying, but this idea of "the number of total bitcoin doubles" is just an accounting distraction, and I can prove it very simply. Yes, in terms of naming something "1 BTC" there is a doubling,* but no one loses any purchasing power (if they HODL). Retention of purchasing power is the entire reason for having a 21M coin limit in the first place. Retention of purchasing power is what makes Bitcoin like digital gold. 
All that happens if there is a hardfork split - putting aside technical issues for the moment - is akin to changing the definition of "an ounce of gold" to mean what is currently called a half an ounce of gold. There is the same amount of gold, but everyone has twice as many "ounces" now, because the name has changed. 
This is just a basic fact of ledger economics: "1 BTC" is just a shorthand term for a certain percentage of the total ledger (one-twenty-one-millionth of the eventual total ledger). Though you would - in the odd scenario of a split into two nearly equally valuable chains - have "2 BTC," the percentage of the total ledger would be unchanged, so besides some scrambling to redo price labels and such, as well as the technical annoyance of dealing with two coins, nothing will have actually changed in terms of purchasing power. 
And note that all such scrambling to change price labels and technical annoyance would only happen because the market made a clear choice that two chains are better than one. It would indeed be quite an odd scenario where the market would make such a decision, so it is not of special concern as it is just the market saying, "Yeah this is a bit awkward, but this is actually the way to maximize the value of the system as a whole."
Also, despite Eth-supporters' protests to the contrary, every cryptocurrency gets its value from people holding it as a store of value. The dynamics work the same, and that is why the market has chosen a clear winner, for all the same reasons as it almost always would for Bitcoin (and again, only *wouldn't* when that itself is the best way to maximize total value). Note also that the total market cap of ETH+ETC was not decreased, in fact it was higher than before the fork. 
As a bonus, the small block side wins a lot of money in the process if they are right, as well as bankrupting the big block side. It is quite a nice thing for everyone once you see the dynamics. (I make no claim as to the technical safety, however, just the economic aspects.)
*Only in the case where there isn't a clear winner, which is highly unlikely, but let's go with that.
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:48:39
It's not completely clear. There are new economic constants introduced that will have unknown effects on incentives. Also, regarding playing politics, there are a lot of fears that SW itself is a political move to make it harder to increase blocksize in the future (something about a 4MB attack surface; it's not my argument, the point is just that it's not so clear-cut with such a complicated new upgrade).

He said he is happy both are gaining popularity, and hopes that the BU market-based approach catches on. Core could adopt a market-based approach to blocksize, too, for example (one of the initial goals of BU was to encourage Core to do just that). Or BU could incorporate Segwit as an option. The situation isn't static.

You act like the competition is credit cards or PayPal. No, the competition is altcoins and forks - in short, the strongest and fastest version of Bitcoin that can be built. 
No one will use alts or forks, because Bitcoin has the network effect in commerce, you will say. Yes, but network effects only go so far, and when they're gone, they're gone. Frittering away the network effect defending an arbitrary constant put in 6 years ago as a shot-in-the-dark temporary hack is not the way to compete.

Nope, except maybe ETC. The split is the only saving grace, as it at least allowed the people who held to unstoppable contracts to keep their chain uncorrupted (even if the whole concept is doomed anyway). 
A split gives the market a direct voice, which both sides should always be happy about - because both sides believe the market will favor themselves.

And Core wouldn't be blocking a blocksize increase. Why can't we have both?
@_date: 2016-11-23 18:06:50
Well articulated. Thank you. A quick response:
1) ETH/ETC hardfork and split into two was anticipated and looked forward to by me and quite a few others. The market value was higher than before, for quite a while, and besides the replay attacks - that are easily prevented if precautions are taken - there was no problem. Everyone got what they wanted. (Yeah, TheDAO was a huge problem, and the rollback was a huge problem, but we can't let that taint the split by association, which was after all the mitigating factor preventing things from being even worse.)
You mention that the market hates uncertainty, and you are exactly right. **That's precisely why a split into two Bitcoins is unlikely unless our ideologies are so irreconcilably different that the market deems the benefits of a split to outweigh the downsides.** In ETH/ETC the divide was extreme and truly irreconcilable, the one side believing that they had to destroy the entire promise of Ethereum in order to save it, and the other taking the Bitcoin-style position that that is a fool's gambit. In Bitcoin, probably the divide is not that strong, especially if the points we are both making here can be digested. Bitcoin also has a currency network effect, which Ethereum doesn't since it isn't used in commerce. 
To see concretely why the bolded text above applies, consider that the more the market is trying to avoid uncertainty, the more the immediate impulse *seconds* after trading starts will be to buy whichever side starts to show a definitive lead and sell the other into oblivion. This is a great party for investors, but it's a non-event for everyone else. In fact, with futures and other such financial products, the issue may even be able to be settled before the fork ever happens, such that if there is no clear winner the trading is called off and rewound. Please consider such non-CS answers to these conundrums. Bitcoin straddles many fields, and develops and coders are not the experts in everything.
2) Your conception of "immutability" seems confused. For example, "immutability" became a key word again over the summer due to TheDAO-undo by ETH, but there it was also a little misleading, as the  early "billions of bitcoins" bug and subsequent (good) mutation showed. That kind of immutability is better termed "sticking to the key monetary features": exactly what the early bitcoin mutation did and ETH's mutation contravened. This is why ETH is trash, not merely because it can hard fork.
I think you are conflating this "sticking to the key monetary features" with being able to change things that are not key monetary features. Because when you said people would want to store their value on an "immutable" chain, this vacillates between the two meanings: people do want to store their money on a chain that sticks to the key monetary features, but do they really care if some of the non-monetary features (like blocktime, blocksize, etc.) are changed as long as the key monetary features are unaffected? I don't think so, though here you might object via 3, so...
3) Yes, it is a perfectly valid opinion to say that being able to run a node via Tor with normal (advanced-country) equipment is the standard to uphold. You might even think that if we can't easily run a node via Tor, the monetary properties will be in jeopardy due to government attack vectors. This is of course highly debatable, and many intelligent opinions are possible. So, why not let the market decide? Devs have some special insight into this, but other people in other fields have other special insight into it. There are all sorts of tradeoffs to consider, and with Bitcoin we have easy ways to set up things like prediction markets (every hard fork can be a prediction market, in particular! - see the cache-22?).
4) Likewise the the above. Why not let the market decide which comes first. Miners are probably increasingly fit to serve as proxies for investors, enabling us to avoid having to do a hard fork that puts these questions to a direct market test. However, if they should fail there, the next step is a market test (=hard fork, yes indeed under controversy as otherwise a market test wouldn't be necessary). 
Overall, I think you have overestimated the chances of a split, the difficulty of knowing about one in advance, and the problems in the event one should occur, as well as equivocating a bit on the term "immutability." It's not ossification that makes Bitcoin conservative and safe; it's the market's basic preference for conservatism (except when change truly is needed). Ossification provides conservatism in a vacuum, but in a changing world there are some things that need to be changed in order to stay safe by outmaneuvering governments - never the monetary properties of course, though, so hodlers are safe. I cannot overemphasize the importance of keeping these two things straight.
As for the rest, it's debatable and I'd suggest letting the market decide, both because I think the market is the best method for distilling the wisdom of the ecosystem and because, at the end of the day, the market will have the final say anyway so we may as well make no pretense to the contrary.

Two implementations is more unstable than one, yes, but each one beyond that starts to make the system increasingly stable as a whole because any single implementation failing will take a minimum portion of the network down.

I don't know about the technical risks, but there are economic questions as it introduces a discount for certain types of data. This is a kind of economic central planning midway through Bitcoin's life, and doing it via a soft fork doesn't allow investors to easily voice their support or non-support as they could if it were a hard fork where they could trade the two sides of the fork against each other on the exchanges. The risk would be if they decide this economic change causes problems and then decide to sell some BTC because they now have reduced optimism about Bitcoin's future (not having the option to only sell the segwit side of the fork). It may be fine or it may not, but it does entail some degree of risk in terms of price.

Gold is a medium of exchange still (a huge number of people around the world aren't going to refuse payment in gold, whereas the same cannot be said for BTC), but more relevantly it used to be THE medium of exchange. There at least needs to be a strong history of serving as a medium of exchange, otherwise people aren't going to want to hold it. 
You can't lift store of value by its own boostraps. Bitcoin has a bit of commerce, which is why it works as a store of value. It needs more commerce, or at least the capacity (onchain or offchain, but soon) to have more commerce, in order to continue growing as a store of value. 
In other words, to be like gold, there have to be a ton of people happy to accept payment in it, even if they usually don't. They could be happy to accept payment in it because it is a good store of value, but that is circular without a basis in commerce.

As long as the other blockchains use the same ledger (ledger copy at time of creation, Bitcoin hodlers preserve all their wealth), yeah that is fine. This is one way to end the debate and in-fighting. 
The catch is we then have multiple currencies to deal with, akin to bi-metalism. Actually wallets could probably become really sophisticated and abstract all the messy stuff (auto-exchanging to rebalance the ratios as needed, based on market movements) away from the user and merchant, though. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:10:10
A spinoff (hardfork with different PoW and tx format, designed to split away) is entirely safe, and preserves hodler purchasing power. You can know it is safe because even if the spinoff explodes, nothing happens. It's a non-event, but if it succeeds it is easy to switch two as it has the very same ledger so after a few adjustments to wallets and such there is no problem with letting the original Bitcoin die. If those last three words freak you out you haven't understood Bitcoin even at an elementary level, as there is no downside for any party in this case (except miners of course! but they are supposed to be proxies for the will of the market, and they have demonstrably failed if we need to do a minority split). This is the very opposite of an altcoin, where hodlers lose everything.

Let's not pretend that 8MB blocks wouldn't also allow a lot more users to access the network at lower fees. This shouldn't be controversial here, as the whole premise of a fee market is that the fees will rise if the cap remains.
How do we weigh much higher fees and much fewer transactions actually being able to happen, against fewer people being able to run a full node? Not to mention the actual motivation to run a full node, as if fees rise high enough only businesses will *want* to transact directly on chain, meaning only they would ever have a reason to run a full node.
In short, I feel like arguments of the sort you are giving discard a ton of nuance.
@_date: 2016-11-21 10:42:37


In the *very* long term, yes, but this has little to do with the next few years, where getting as important to the global economy as possible, as fast as possible, is a pretty high priority in terms of avoiding government crackdowns. (Not to mention avoiding competition from altcoins, which almost universally do not think to the next year, let alone decades ahead like this.)


Why not? It's their implementation. And likewise if they wanted to fork to lower the blocksize to 100kB. I'd rather Core do whatever it wants and have a free and open attitude to other implementations offering different things, than have Core do nothing but softforks in order to "avoid contention."

BU so far leaves the ecosystem to coordinate such a checkpoint, but may well give a code option sometime soon. I think parent is looking at BU through the Core lens, wherein the dev team is relied upon to organize everything and just feed it to the users as a nice neat package.

Even at $40, with full blocks we will always have the opportunity for spikes like this, especially with how LN works since if you don't get your contract-breach transaction confirmed in time, coin-stealing is possible. It's simply not a viable model, and I'm not sure why anyone expected software engineers to be able to come up with a viable model for what is an economic issue. I and others warned of this for years, but the halo effect on "the Bitcoin Wizards" (as the Core developers called themselves) has been a strong psychological bias to overcome.

We agree here. No matter the outcome of this debate, if one side does decide to split away they better be changing their PoW algo (or it would arguably be irresponsible *not* to attack the minority, lest it bit back one day). ETH is not a running system; it's a system that hopes to operate for its original purpose at a later date, unlike Bitcoin which operated for its original purpose from Day 1. Many irrelevant anomalies that don't carry over are to be expected in a system like ETH.

@_date: 2016-11-21 12:23:39


This is funny because that is exactly what Core *doesn't* do that BU at least tries to do. I know you disagree with the AD settings, but it is an attempt at fixing the problem - and one that can easily be ignored if you think it is bad. If the network makes an unexpected hard fork blocksize shift, the Core users must at present download an emergency upgrade before they can handle it (if they wish to). BU users can have it handled automatically, or ignored automatically if they wish. 
See, you're confusing the handling of a coordinated fork with the handling of an unexpected event. The later case BU is uniquely equipped for. The former case BU leaves to the ecosystem, as I said. "Solving" this "problem" of emergent order necessarily means exerting top-down control. 
Anyway, it's frustrating to keep repeating this, but BU does nothing  different from Core except allow what requires special modding in Core, to be done through a GUI. Any perceived "problems" are solved by simply setting the settings to match Core and then ignoring them. You can perhaps object that BU shouldn't be offered to anyone but "advanced" users - that would at least be a valid objection, as an amateur could make an error. For what it's worth, BU is thinking of making its current version be labeled as "for miners and pools," and making a more friendly version for casual users.

Yes, whichever side of the debate you fall on, and whatever your position on the dangers of controversial hard forks, they are coming.


Amen to that. Though fully internalizing this point actually makes things like spinoffs* just as good, and probably technically a lot easier than a hardfork. Thoughts?
*actually I'm not sure if there is a principled difference between a spinoff and an alt-bitcoin. Both are ledger-preserving, meaning hodlers are unaffected in all cases. Perhaps the only difference between a spinoff/alt-bitcoin and just a plain hardfork is that of intent: the former is intended to cause a split, whereas the latter is intended to avoid a split.

They cannot be **conceptually the same** unless they have all the guarantees and properties of a Bitcoin transaction, which is not the case when channel timeouts are considered. 
Also, until someone figures out decentralized routing, there is a strong argument that hubs will centralize for efficiency, massively aggravating the timeout problem (especially under a low blocksize cap, where "can't get my tx in" can mean actual funds get stolen by channel timeouts; problem goes from "can't afford to do onchain tx" to "can't afford to protect my money" - system goes from passive wealth protection to the need for active and often expensive wealth protection and monitoring needed).

Is "big blocks" supposed to mean 1MB or 100kB, or 100MB? I think this is a realistic question in view of "1 computer = 1 node" in the picture being depicted as the favorable state of the network. I have no problem with proposing a standard minimum node spec, but without specifying what that spec is, this really doesn't say much. 
Also, what of the effect of decentralization - and difficulty to attack - from having more users and simply being more economically important as a result of having more capacity sooner rather than later? This is a many-faceted issue, and there are many kinds of decentralization each with different benefits. These must be weighed, and I believe they should be weighted in a market process rather than in any kind of top-down process.

They have a shadowban filter on the real names of several people who have complained to the reddit admins about doxing. (Including theymos, so it isn't a one-sided thing.) The reason for this is that the admins can demote mods who allow doxing on their subs, so they have to be careful (I'll be surprised if doesn't have similar filters).
It looks like this led to a post by nullc being hidden, nullc asking why, a mod saying it counts as doxing, nullc calling the mod a coward, then the mod banning him for a day (despite the sidebar rule stipulating a permaban for doxing).
Looks like overreaction on both sides. Bandying about someone's name who doesn't to be public and only is due to past doxing (like theymos) is bad form, but so is any kind of elevated punitive action for provoking a mod. I've said it for mods here so I will say it for mods there: mods need to have thick skin. They have power over people; insults come with the territory.

Why? There are two main scenarios: 
1) The market converges on a single winner in trading. In this case anyone who slept through it just thinks Bitcoin got a normal hardfork upgrade. 
2) The market allows for two. The market isn't dumb.^^[1] It wouldn't allow for two unless that would be the more value-enhancing option. Your view is that that would be a value-destroying option that would lose all the public's trust. If you are right, then the market simply won't pick that option, so no need to worry.
Therefore, in no case will Bitcoin die or be damaged, but rather enhanced. In the unlikely event of a total split, any public confusion that resulted from a split would be outweighed by other advantages - says the market.
[1]If the market *is* dumb, rejoice because you are about to make a ton of money by betting against it! ;)

Note that the main concerns you mentioned are matters of confusion in user interface (as far as miners fighting, a PoW change would prevent that completely). It's probably going to take a bunch of ironing out to deal with wallets and such to make it seamless to the end user, but OP has acknowledged that. 
Not to mention that most splits (this term is more distinguishing than "hard fork") will result in just one coin, almost immediately after trading starts, so that there is no confusion. The only time investors would allow an underdog to continue to exist is if they truly believed that everything you are saying is easily rectified and will not have and long-term consequences on the price. Investors may be wrong, but if so you stand to gain a ton of money from their folly.

I wouldn't be championing the term "immutability." It's *close* but it's not exactly the right term for what separates Bitcoin from, say, ETH. 
Mutating or rolling back a chain is a fine emergency measure if you have a spec (or at least a common understanding of what the blockchain is supposed to do) and the base blockchain software doesn't conform to that. 
- In Bitcoin, the monetary properties are known to all: no extra coin issuance, for example. Early on, Bitcoin mutated its chain to *preserve* this property in a good way (undoing the "billions of bitcoins" bug).
- In Ethereum, one of the key properties was "contracts that don't care" / mechanical execution / neutral execution of contract code. ETH mutated its chain not to preserve this property, but to *break* it. Ethereum worked exactly according to spec, exactly like everyone expected it to, yet they decided to undo what had transpired because they didn't like it. 
A blockchain "having" immutability isn't a thing. Keeping to the spec that holds to certain kinds of immutability, explicitly, is a thing. Bitcoin has kept to its spec, but ETH hasn't (but to my knowledge, ETC has). 
In other words, Bitcoin's holy grail is that its investors (and by proxy, miners) are smart enough to hold to the spec, or the basic monetary properties of Bitcoin. Even if a bunch of new investors came in and crowded out the smart investors, bidding up a chain that only sticks to spec when it is convenient, the rest of us could still splinter off like ETC did. Unlike in Ethereum, I think in Bitcoin people know why "sticking to the spec even when inconvenient" matters. The wide-eyes futurology types will be attracted to pie-in-the-sky stuff like ETH instead, so it should never be a problem.

"Artificial" isn't a useful word here. 
The question is whether a given setting is crucial to the monetary properties of Bitcoin (sound money, liquid, uninflatable, reasonably fast, un-attackable, etc.). You can argue that the blocksize limit prevents Bitcoin from being attacked (highly debatable), but you cannot argue that it is a fundamental aspect of the monetary properties - because if unattackability can be achieved any other way (or god forbid, small blocksize cap actually turned out to *increase* attackability), this is shown as invalid. The same cannot be said for the coin supply limit!
@_date: 2016-11-28 22:33:36
Gold proves my point. The key is t must at least have a *history* of being widely accepted in exchange (though gold in fact still is happily accepted by a ton of people around the world, even if it isn't common to pay in it; acceptance in commerce ). The medium-of-exchange function is a limiting factor on how much store of value you can get. 
Bitcoin doesn't have much history, so it needs more medium of exchange basis (at least the ability to transact smoothly if necessary, whether onchain or off) to grow to higher reliance on it as a store of value. Otherwise it's "just a bubble" in the sense that its valuation is circular: "it's a store of value because I can always sell it off to someone else if I need real resources because it's a store of value because I can always..."

^ Circular reasoning. Maintaining commercial network effect is largely contingent on staying on top. If there is big transaction demand before your 2nd-layer scaling is ready, they will have no choice but to use an alt or fork. 
Then the network effect will be with them, and good luck getting it back with an explicit policy of ossification and "5% can veto any change."

I'm glad at least someone is willing to admit the existence of lightweight wallets makes a large difference in node count. 
Note that the biggest argument for keeping blocks small made by developers like Gregory Maxwell is that node count has been falling as blocks have gotten bigger. The fact that using Bitcoin basically used to require running a full node and that it has become increasingly practical not to run a full node thanks to light clients? This is usually dismissed as a minor factor. I think that is quite an unrealistic dismissal, on a pivotal issue.

Bitcoin's main [critical]( uses are for capital controls, store of value, offshoring, and dark markets. The first three are highly fee-insensitive, but dark markets are only somewhat fee-insensitive. Once fees get into the &gt;$1 range you're going to have drug buyers and vendors feeling the heat and wanting to switch. 
I mean, it's pretty simple: if there are quite a few dealers willing to accept an alt, and it only costs a one-time few dollars to exchange your BTC to the alt via Shapeshift, then you save *dollars* off every subsequent purchase, this altcoin thing is going to catch on really quickly. Then Bitcoin's network effect is lost, followed by investors, then all the other pivotal "must-use-Bitcoin" use cases I mentioned.
**TL;DR:** The cost of darkmarket users periodically shapeshifting their BTC into alts for spending money is the limiting factor on how high Bitcoin fees can go without breaking the commercial network effect (until 2nd-layer scaling arrives).

The market cap of ETH+ETC was higher after the split than before. The fact that they both declined later is simply due to Ethereum being overhyped garbage, not the split.

Which was excellent (within the overall shitshow that is Ethereum). I don't see how anyone can objectively say the split was unhelpful: everyone got their way, and even the ETH people got to make extra money on the breakaway faction by selling their ETC to them at inflated prices. (ETC people likely think the same thing about selling the ETH people their ETH.) It is win-win from each side's perspective, even though Ethereum as a whole is going down for other reasons. The split was a glorious bright spot in an otherwise sordid affair.
Were a similar split to happen in Bitcoin, with say the big block faction breaking away and dying, small block supporters would get to sell their forked coins to the big blockers at inflated prices. Thus if say 40% left, small blockers get 40% richer on average. What's not to like?
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:34:56

Actually that is exactly how it works. It's call the Fidelity Effect. Companies like Fidelity look at Bitcoin and see that it only has 3TPS capacity and hear it will require some not-yet-fully-characterized special sauce to make it scale more, so they scrap their plans to build on it. 
But let's say you are right and 1MB is near the perfect number. Others claim otherwise, and no one is an an expert on this because it involves both code and economics. Investors are the ones to ultimately decide (a prediction market), and they cannot make a real A-or-B decision until there are two mutually incompatible forks to choose from, on the exchanges, open for buying and selling (either in present coins or in fork futures). This would be a great boon to you if you are right, because big blockers like me would buy your big-block bitcoins for full price as you dispose of them. Then when we fail (&lt;wink&gt;) you will have nearly doubled your money. 
The market test is win-win and ends the contention because the losers no longer have any stake in the economy.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:16:16


They actually forfeit their money to the winners. From the point of view of maximizing your holdings, splinter groups should be encouraged to break off, as long as they die. You get to sell your splinter coins to them at a premium as they sell you their mainstream bitcoins at a discount. 20% of the economy breaking away means an average gain of 20% on your current BTC holdings. 
Also you don't have to worry about as many incorrect people being in Bitcoin anymore, nor having any holdings. You basically get to kick out the stupid and take their money (assuming you're right and they're wrong). History will soon forget them, if anyone in the general public even notices, and the remaining people will be stronger, richer, and more unified. What's not to like?

I encounter that fear often in debate, but it is unfounded. Ethereum was worth *more* after the split for quite a while after the trading settled down. It fell subsequently only because it had it coming: it zoomed up from low single digits toward $20 on the back of the amazing DAO, and then the whole thing imploded in absolutely spectacular fashion yet the price is still in double digits? - no way that was going to last, split or no. It went from a field of sunshiney hyper-hopium flowers to a desolate warzone and the price didn't even halve from the peak of a giant bubble top. Not a stable situation.
The reason the fear is unfounded is simply that the market would always converge on a single clear winner if it deemed a split to be more harmful than helpful. In other words, if investors fears a split they would sell the loser and buy the winner the moment one started pulling ahead - probably in the first few minutes of trading. 
The only case where the market would allow two winners is if it really considered that to be the most value-enhancing option, which would mean the market value of the total system would be higher than before, and holders would be wealthier in total just by hodling.

Bitcoin can't be a store of value without being a medium of exchange. Its store of value properties derive from it being a medium of exchange. The more of a medium of exchange it is, the greater its potential use as a store of value. Trying to build a huge store-of-value system on a tiny footprint of medium of exchange is bound to fail. Medium of exchange cannot be written off as some "nice to have" thing; it is the basis of everything.

Bravo! Better terminology is to be encouraged. The main takeaway is that "soft fork" is a very sloppy term. 
I was however disappointed with the hard fork analysis, as the author ironically argues circularly in reasoning that a spinoff contains a circularity. The circularity the author introduces is in the definition of "Bitcoin." He doesn't seem to understand the fundamental point that Bitcoin *just is* the ledger that reflects all current bitcoin holders' balances - including all copies of that ledger. CLAMS is technically an (extremely) tiny percentage of Bitcoin from the perspective of then-BTC-holders, because it contains a tiny sliver of the market cap (times its already-small spinoff allocation to BTC holders). 
Any spinoff/hardfork that *were to* gain an appreciable market cap, and not be divested from by BTC holders, would indeed constitute a piece of Bitcoin. That this scenario may be highly unlikely shouldn't distract from the fact that should it occur the foregoing would be true. If you will say this other ledger won't have network effect, that again only serves to make it an unlikely scenario, rather than impugn the basic logic. 
The stakeholders decides what Bitcoin is; if there is a split into two ledger-copies and there is any controversy, the market prices one higher and thereby grants it an overwhelming likelihood of inheriting the Bitcoin name. Better to think in terms of the World Wide Ledger than in terms of Bitcoin. Hardforking preserves the ledger and lets the market choose which protocol is to govern it (you can disagree and go your own way with your no-hard-forks Bitcoin ledger-copy, but note that it may be at very low market cap, defeating the store of value function that was the point of Bitcoin in the first place).
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:21:39
That's not the way markets work. If someone ends up on a different fork and buys it, you get to sell your forked coins to them. If you are right, forked coins head to $0 and you win money off the people who thought they knew better by forking away. If you are right, you should always *welcome* breakaway movements, as they make you richer (and raise the community intelligence level). If 20% of the economy does a dumb fork, it will go to exchange arbitrage, then on average every other holder - who doesn't follow the dumb fork - gets 20% wealthier. 
It's quite a nice thing, if you are confident in your position. A controversial Bitcoin fork is just a prediction market, not something to fear or lament. It's a chance to profit off of being right.

BU is just Core with the blocksize limits unlocked. If that's all that's preventing a centralized future, Core is just as doomed to that centralized future, as anyone can modify the Core code, especially a mining pool (they already do).

The cycle cannot get started without medium of exchange. It is putting the cart before the horse to seek store of value before medium of exchange. The two work off each other and must be mixed. In particular, the degree of medium-of-exchange usage is a limiting factor on store of value.

More like a misleading statement. He is entirely right that there is no commerce to speak of on Ethereum - or any altcoin for that matter. The part about hardforking is just opportunism, though. If Bitcoin never existed but ETH did, everyone in the world would opportunistically say blockchains are bullshit because ETH is a shitshow, but they would be wrong. ETH is simply a shitshow that messes everything up. That they did hardforking wrong is not an indicator of anything.

They go to the miners. However, miners are actually getting less money than they otherwise would have if the blocksize limit were higher. Higher fees, but much fewer of them, makes for less revenue, not more. It's a lose-lose situation, due to the introduction of an arbitrary economic constraint.

Erm? BU's whole concept is to stop shoehorning code in like Core does. Core spoonfeeds users certain code settings because they think it falls on the devs to ensure users stay in Nakamoto consensus. BU disagrees and entrusts the miners and nodes to reach emergent consensus. Whichever is the right path, the fact that Core holds the former position and BU the latter shouldn't be controversial.

Note that BU can be used for a Type 2 fork as well. That's part of the vision: give users flexible tools and let the ecosystem coordinate the best type of fork. This is exactly what we are doing here. Discussing how forks work and what would be best is part of such coordination.
Maybe some of the BU tools will go unused and shouldn't be used at all, but in any case there are enough tools there to allow for Type 2 already, save for replay attacks (which will need to be a collaborative effort). BU doesn't advocate any special way of using it (except if you count the default settings), so it isn't really correct to say it is Type 3 and not also easily Type 2, or even Type 1 - for the simple reason that not all coordination has to happen in the software itself.

This sounds like you're saying that if the miners couldn't override the settings, because the dev team locked them in, it would be more decentralized. I don't understand, because that sounds more centralized, whereas letting each miner decide sounds more decentralized.
I mean, miners can override any setting in Core as well, just by modding the code a bit. The only difference is one implementation lets them do that through a GUI instead.

In that case it is still the Bitcoin ledger, so whether you will want to call it "Bitcoin" or not, it preserves investor value, unlike an altcoin. Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin, at base, to act as a store of value? Copying the ledger a thousand times doesn't affect that function at all, as everyone's percentage stake remains the same. Purchasing power of existing holders is unaffected, no matter which copy (or copies) win or die, as long as at least on survives.

As far as I can tell, he was banned for breaking a sitewide rule and then calling a mod a coward. The first part is fair, the second is not fair - but it shouldn't obscure the fact that the mod was considering not banning him even though he break a rule that could get the mods in trouble. 
The way reddit works, the admins have the mods police their own subs. If there is a sitewide rule broken, they rely on the mods to clean it up. Like many subs, they have a filter on comments that mention certain frequently doxed persons. Thus nullc wondered why his comment wasn't showing up. At that point the safe thing for the mod to do would have been to report nullc to the admins who may have permabanned him. Instead the mod, apparently knowing the shitstorm that would cause, appeared ready to let it slide, but after nullc called him a coward he cracked, probably thinking "Welp, I was trying to be nice, but fine. This is my ass on the line anyway, so here's your one-day ban." It was an overstep on both their parts.

If that's the case, then increasing from 500kB to 1MB didn't help to scale either. Obviously there is a need for some degree of blocksize scaling, and some degree of other-layer scaling. This doesn't do anything to justify 1MB in particular, which we all agree was an arbitrary number.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:40:37
With good reason. Raising tx exorbitantly far above the natural market rate by introducing an Economic Change Event through a very low blocksize limit is an extra subsidy to miners that was not part of the original proposition to Bitcoin investors, [exactly like]( raising the 21M coin limit would be. A lot of people would quit (or just fork away) if the 21M limit were lifted, but many of these same people seem to have no problem with inflation by another name.

Brigade isn't the proper term for simple opinion downvoting from readers within the same thread, but I agree that can happen and it is unfortunate (not anywhere near as bad as deletion - note how many comments often follow a "hidden" comment, sometimes it is 50+, so someone is reading them). 
Reasonably articulated posts that don't seem obviously obtuse generally aren't downvoted much though. Sometimes it can be hard - on both subs, and all of reddit actually - to know why a certain type of comment triggers downvotes. Often it's something like everyone in that sub has seen a particular argument hundreds of times and downvotes because it has been addressed. Gmax gets upvoted there quite a bit, and downvoted at other times. As someone coming in it can be hard to know without feeling things out.

It's actually worse than this, because the time to find a block is subject to wide variance. If you pay "the proper fee" now, or even well above the proper fee, but then a block isn't found for quite a while, your fee may no longer be proper at all. 
It's a fundamental issue with the full blocks idea: **"the proper fee" can only be known after the fact.**

It's very easy to change Bitcoin through a fork (while keeping the ledger; not an altcoin); the question is who will keep their coins in a fork instead of selling them off? 
- If the change is bad, most people will get rid the forked coins while they still have a price. 
- If the change is good, most people will get rid of the unforked coins while they still have a price.
This dynamic prevents bad changes but allows good changes.

This is very inaccurate phrasing, and phrasing here matters. They didn't develop most of the consensus rules; Satoshi did. They don't as a general rule develop "the" consensus rules; if they did, they would be the rulers of Bitcoin. 
It should read: "The team that has recently been developing the consensus rules that the market has adopted..." 
But if you had phrased it accurately you wouldn't have been able to slip in that false dichotomy wherein those who want bigger blocks (and are somehow not cautious) are just some get-rich-quickers.

A one-time increase would be pointless. It's choosing a subsequent increase rate of zero, which is just about the only rate we know for sure is too low. It merely forces the next hard fork to come earlier. No sense in that at all, no matter what your position on blocksize.

It doesn't have to be, but even if 25% would *prefer* smaller blocks, how many of those are willing to sacrifice the network effects of going with the most valuable ledger for that preference? I would guess very, very few. (To be fair, the same is true for the reverse case.)

The "*entire* (for all practical purposes) Bitcoin economy" is never going to be on board with any change, so if that's your standard Bitcoin is doomed. Or if you want to take "practical purposes" seriously, any economic majority in support of a fork is the only practicality that matters, and Bitcoin is not doomed at all, since it can and will change when it makes economic sense to do so. 
The oddity of your approach is that it boils down to a present bias, like we cannot be allowed to talk about possible Bitcoin futures. XT is a possible future, and you at least wisely admit that this redefinition of what Bitcoin is can happen. What sense does it make to ban discussion of something that could happen and would be of the utmost relevance to the readership?
Imagine it: XT with its "mere" 75% miner consensus goes forward, but there is still not a full consensus for "all intents and purposes" because say 5% still use Core. The Core coins are sold off by a factor of about 20 for the XT coins, making Core's market cap rival Litecoin's. Then you will still say that XT is an altcoin? Don't you see the complete untenability of that position?
In fact, the same "consensus for all intents and purposes" standard then comes back and bites Core. It becomes even *more* of an altcoin, having even far less than consensus for it than XT does. Whatever strictures apply to XT would have to apply 20 times as much to Core. 
The error here is assuming we need one very high standard consensus for change but for some reason we do not require that standard of consensus for staying the same. Why would that be? The environment in which Bitcoin operates is not static. In fact it is radically not static. What possible justification is there for a status quo bias, other than the precautionary principle (which becomes meaningless as soon as it's no longer clear whether the greater risk is in changing or in staying the same in the face of a changing environment)?

XT is only getting support because it has bigger blocks (and some legit dev power). Very few people are rallying around Hearn himself, except maybe his recent arguments. Luckily, as soon as we have multiple viable forks and implementations to choose from, the issues ceases to be about people. Any changes are vetted by the community and users only upgrade later when they are satisfied there is nothing funny. It's not like Hearn could secretly slip in whitelisting or something. In fact I'd guess the XT version with only the blocksize change (no other differences from Core at all) will be most popular, and any later updates to XT will be most popular if they otherwise follow Core exactly, at least until we have a whole universe of implementations to choose from.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:24:09
This "altcoin" issue actually contains the seed of the solution: an altcoin has so far almost always been an alt-protocol that is also an alt-ledger, having no relation to Bitcoin's ledger. But what about an alt-protocol that is *not* also an alt-ledger? An alt-protocol that maintains Bitcoin's ledger could be called an altcoin, but it is better called by its own name, such as "[spinoff](
A spinoff is an amazing thing for a BTC holder in this debate, because it serves the same purpose as a fork: it changes the protocol while keeping everyone's coin balance the same. If you have 10 BTC out of 21 million in Core, you will have 10 BTC out of 21 million in the spinoff.  So for example if a spinoff were made that is exactly like Bitcoin but allows 4MB blocks, and due to a surge in adoption causing Core BTC to lower in value, your 10 BTC in the spinoff are 100x the price of your 10 BTC in Core, which would you treat as the de facto "Bitcoin"? Which would most people treat as Bitcoin? 
Let's also suppose that every Core dev, and Gavin and Mike too - heck go ahead and add Satoshi himself - were adamantly against this spinoff. Would that matter? No commerce would be done in Core Bitcoin, nothing would be built around it, it would be dead to the world, a curiosity of history. No consensus, in fact a consensus for the opposite, but who cares? If the spinoff is supported by the market, it will be the *de facto* Bitcoin. Sure, it could glitch out or get centralized and destroyed as one might expect considering all the bigtime devs are against it, but until it does no one is going to consider the theoretically better Core Bitcoin to be Bitcoin at all. 
The spinoff dynamic, although originally suggested as a way to "bootstrap an altcoin using Bitcoin's ledger," in fact is the perfect device to demonstrate that consensus among devs matters only insofar as it is a factor in investors' decisions to favor particular versions. The market will likely not go against all the devs, but it is perfectly comfortable going against some of them. The market requires no consensus, although it prefers consensus if it can get it. When the market deems it urgent, though, a spinoff or fork that makes the favored changes will skyrocket compared to Core, assuming Core stands still.

Core places the consensus in the wrong place: among their little circle of sages. Consensus happens among the nodes, not among the devs. This is open source. Forcing consensus in a particular implementation merely adds pointless deadlock within *that implementation* and paves the road to irrelevance for *that implementation*, as we are seeing now. 
It's looking more and more like most of the Core commissars (and others among the old guard), drunk on their perceived power, are throwing Hail Mary's in a last ditch attempt to stem the tide.

Why is smaller blocks the conservative side? With altcoins nipping at Bitcoin's heels during the next wave of adoption, the conservative option is arguably to try to the raise blocksize cap high enough that altcoins cannot easily trump Bitcoin in that area.

All you really need is the mods to exist as a *threat* so that the effort expended to do major vote manipulation will never be worth it, so it never becomes a thing. Actually censoring posts that are highly upvoted and commented, that are about imoportant subjects, just because the mods want to silence debate, is pure poison. The mods have tried to call people upvoting content about XT "brigading" when it's clearly just people wanting to see the content since it's, you know, highly relevant (whether you are for or against XT). Complete abuse of language, glaring sign of desperation, mark of an establishment structure on its way out.

That can't last long. And also how do you define consensus? Core is just one implementation, that happens to enjoy popular support so far. That can easily change.

You don't understand something fundamental about Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the continual option to adapt; the constancy you see is not due to some stricture in its ability to adapt, it's due to the stakeholders continually opting for the status quo up to now. That can of course change at any time. 
Imagine two buttons, one marked "Stay the same" and the other marked "Adapt."
[STAY THE SAME]
The stakeholders have kept on pressing the first button, because that is what maximizes value under the prevailing circumstances so far. This has created the illusion that "it is hard for Bitcoin to adapt." The reality is that Bitcoin can very easily adapt if the stakeholders start pushing a different button, which *will happen* the moment it is clear to enough people that a different button is what will maximize value. 
Another way to think about it: Bitcoin is constantly choosing to multiply the blocksize cap by 1. The vote is cast over and over again for the null change, like a man who is awake and fully able to move but is for reasons of current circumstance choosing not to move. He can and will move as soon as it is advantageous to do so, yet shallow thinkers who cannot appreciate the reason he has chosen not to move so far will falsely conclude that he is paralyzed.

The argument that governments may 51% attack Bitcoin may be seen as unserious perhaps, but not that they may ban it if it is still small. Growing large and vital to a nation's economy is a crucial step, and it is a very serious - and very powerful - point. This is how it is that the Internet has flourished largely untouched so far. Governments are addicted to the revenue and too many people find it too useful in its current largely uncensored form.

Although I agree with the sentiment about this sub becoming elitist, taking a charitable interpretation of Luke in this particular instance make this seems like semantics. Luke is defining the term "using Bitcoin" in an odd way, or maybe even a way that makes sense in context. He presumably really means "running Core." The consensus by code doesn't have to be Core; it is whatever it is, and de facto Bitcoin is just the name we give to whatever maintains the ledger and money supply rules while having the largest market capitalization. 
Luke's response makes some sense in itself, but I completely agree that it is narrowly code focused, completely missing the forest for the trees: the ledger is what matters. You're using the ledger, voting by HODLing and using.
To see how pointless "node consensus" is as a measure of what Bitcoin is, consider what happens if there is a spinoff of Bitcoin (an alternative protocol that maintains the same ledger and coin issuance schedule) and it becomes far more valuable than the original Bitcoin. You and your friend still have all your coins duplicated in both systems, if you sat tight during the spinoff's rise, but you don't run any software, just use the BTC on the spinoff as always since most merchants and exchanges have switched over. 
Your friend, meanwhile, keeps running Core, keeps voting for that Core consensus. But no one takes his coins in Core, or if they do it's at less that 1% of the going rate. He will have to use his coins in the spinoff, unless of course he was so stubborn that he sold all those off already in favor of more Core BTC. What good did that "vote" do him? 
Since the definition of what Bitcoin is is not static and in practice depends entirely on the price of the forks (if multiple viable forks exist), running a node has little to nothing to do with it. Run Core? Run XT? Not voting, just giving a show of solidarity.  Sell BTC on the Core fork and buy BTC on the XT fork, or vice versa? Now you're voting.

Hard forks are governed by the market. The hard forks so far have been a unique feature of the implementation monoculture that has existed up to now, and are atypical of what we can expect going forward as this centralization risk is mitigated by a plurality of implementations. 
Going forward, all hard forks are liable to be "controversial," and the market will be deciding which one wins through a fork arbitrage process that will likely happen on the exchanges. There's your governance structure. It's essentially a prediction market for which fork will win, becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy (a governance structure that is sometimes called "futarchy"). It is, of course, not a centralized governance structure, but a decentralized one, as is the goal.
Moreover, it does not require agreement or consensus among any preset group. Instead, whenever changes are proposed that look like they may be broadly perceived as substantially value-increasing for Bitcoin, the forking arbitrage process will take place on the exchanges, and within a few minutes or hours the market will provide a definitive answer. Because of how strongly the market values network effects, almost all such processes will result in a single clear victor (either status quo or the new proposal). 
Only if Bitcoin is truly at a crossroads where there is great value in both paths, and those paths are deemed by the market to be utterly mutually exclusive, would this process ever result in a split into two persistently valuable blockchains (and in such rare cases, that would likely be a good thing).

"Hostile fork" becomes meaningless when you realize that it isn't the conservatism and prudence of the Core committers that keeps Bitcoin from changing in silly directions, but rather the conservatism and prudence of investors. Up to now those two groups have been enough in agreement to give the illusion that it is the Core committers who are in control, but of course there will come a time when a small insular group of people won't be able to keep up with the wisdom of the market.

This is such a blinkered notion and quintessential example of missing the forest for the trees that I don't know where to begin. Altcoin discussion is only occasionally relevant to Bitcoin, and it was only ever occasionally upvoted enough to hit the front page. Bypassing the user voting mechanism that has made reddit such a successful site and modding it away is already quite heavyhanded. But in any case the justification is that these are irrelevant to Bitcoin, and hence to preserve a high ratio of content subscribers will likely be interested in, the mods have taken the questionable but understandable position of directly mod-censoring altcoin discussion. 
To extend this line of reasoning to any fork of Bitcoin can only be justified by a claim that that fork is irrelevant to Bitcoin and the readership. However, in this case such a claim is so obviously untenable that it should be an enormous red flag that something is amiss in your thinking that you could even entertain writing such a thing.

It seems to work remarkably well. Vote manipulation doesn't work so well because it takes resources and mods can nullify all that resource expenditure very easily the moment they catch on. 
Think what vote manipulation would actually look like: there would be odd scores on comments, without actual thought-out comments to back them up (because if we're talking actual thought-out comments then these are legit people making points and can't be called manipulation). I see that very occasionally, on both sides of the debate, but it is not particularly common.
Sometimes, though, to people who haven't been following the debate, it can look like something is being downvoted unfairly even though there is good reason, such as that it repeats a point that has been refuted to death already a few days or weeks prior.

Slippery slope fallacy. Some investors might want dumb, value-decreasing changes, but most won't. It is not by the veto power of the Core devs that Bitcoin remains stable; it is by the fact that the market wants consistency. The nice thing about the market being in control is that it will choose change sometimes, but only when that change is deemed value-increasing. Only in the rare case that there is a very sizable contingent of investors who vehemently disagree will there be a lasting split.

The reason Bitcoin will be hard to infiltrate is that money is on the line, and the more people misled by such tactics the greater an astute investor stands to profit from their errors. That means here will always be many investors on the lookout for such things. Since investors are ultimately who [control Bitcoin]( it is not so easy. Having the free and open discussion also helps (oops!).

You wouldn't split it, because it's not a one-time vote. For example, suppose 8MB had 30% support, 4MB had 30% support, and Core (1MB) had 40% support. If this keeps up, Core will win. But the moment it looks like either 4MB or 8MB is taking a decisive lead over the other, most users would switch. That would make the lead way more lopsided, soon converging with nearly all the people that supported the other larger block option switching over. Since a persistent neck-and-neck situation is highly improbable, I don't see a concern.

It'll happen when and if a person who used all the easy anonymity features is known to be caught by blockchain analysis. 
That might well be never, and even if it is tomorrow, Monero is not a threat because it is an alternative ledger. You could make a Bitcoin-ledger Monero and every bitcoin holder would automatically have an equal percentage of its market cap as they have of Bitcoin's (i.e., if you own 1% of all BTC, you would automatically own 1% of all Bitcoin-ledger Monero). It is ultimately pointless to market altcoins (insofar as they are alt-ledgers rather than alternative protocols for updating the World Wide Ledger) to Bitcoin holders. You will get some short-term investors, but once it steps up enough in market cap a spinoff that uses Bitcoin's ledger will be released and kill the alt-ledger.

Yup. Terminology abuse happens whenever people start having to twist their logic and overreach to try to reconcile two contradictory positions they hold at once. That's why in George Orwell's *1984*, newspeak (using the same word to refer to conflicting things) and doublethink go hand in hand. Newspeak is what enables doublethink, in this debate and everywhere. 
Also add the term "consensus" to the mix. And shades of this in the word "core."
Bottom line: if a definition in this debate wobbles, push it. Clarifying terms is the only way to close off those doublethink channels.

This view seems too narrowly code-focused. If you're worried about hostility by governments, the inability to adapt quickly by hard forks that may be what are necessary enable "too big to ban"-level mass adoption is the greatest risk of all.
It is a fallacy to imagine that Bitcoin standing still is risk-minimizing when the world and its relation to Bitcoin is changing rapidly. We have altcoin competition to consider as well. Avoid risk of bugs all you want. "No bugs here! Bug free zone! Awesome security!" Meanwhile Bitcoin becomes  on coinmarketcap because NASDAQ and many others decided the possible risk of bigger blocks was worth it and they weren't interested in 3 TPS + maybe some other scaling solution that hopefully will be in operation a couple years later.
TL;DR: Ultraconservatism at some point eventually loops back and becomes radicalism, because the world does not stand still.

Why assume this results in greater centralization? Allowing 8x scaling during the next adoption surge seems like it would allow for a lot of market growth, a lot more people getting into Bitcoin, and a lot more people running full nodes.

People are pushing to be given the choice. Without a viable hard fork option, how can Core even claim any real support. It's like saying Tesco is loved by the community because everyone shops there, but it's the only supermarket in town. Put in a Safeway and then we'll know something about whether Tesco is loved.

Beyond this, in the first place it's odd to say that "change requires consensus" but that "no-change does not require consensus." The moment some contingent wants a change, we no longer have consensus on the status quo. By that standard, the position closest to having a consensus at this time is the position that is for a substantially larger blocksize cap.
So consensus is a lost cause either way. All that matters is economic majority.

Extremely. This kind of change can never happen unless a huge economic bloc agrees it needs to, and even then the people who want to stay with the old version can. It's just a matter of where the economic activity goes. For the next several decades at least, there is no reason to expect a higher inflation version would get economic support, and in the far future when it might happen it would be a very minor amount of additional inflation, since there wouldn't be economic support for anything other than that minimal amount.
It doesn't have much to do with code, but with the network effect of the powerful convention of Bitcoin as it is.

Far more elegant and far more non-existent. If these scaling solutions are ready in time, and they work, great. But it doesn't look like they will be anywhere near ready. 
Besides, if the 1MB cap is klugey, then raising or eliminating it doesn't seem like it can be called klugey as well. It has to be one or the other, at least in the case of eliminating it (raising it is likely tantamount to eliminating it for a while). Either it's a kluge or removing it is a kluge. Can't be both. In fact, removing a kluge is one of the most unequivocally elegant types of solutions.

Why on earth would you buy a greater proportion of the market cap of an altcoin than you have of Bitcoin? For example, Namecoin's market cap is about 1/500 of Bitcoin's, yet you allocate 1/20 of your money to it. That means if Namecoin and Bitcoin switched places you'd have 25 times more money. Nice for your if it happens, but that's a bet that Namecoin is 25 times as likely to succeed as Bitcoin. Was that your intention??
Besides, premines/ninjamines like Dash and Ether (Ripple is of course the worst) are horrible long-term investments compared to normally mined coins. 
It really seems like you're just taking the only "diversification is good" saw and placing arbitrary safe-sounding numbers to it, with no thought of market cap or the dynamics of each. 
EDIT: If you crunch the numbers, a very small percentage in your chosen coins will leave you in just as good a position as now in the extremely unlikely event that any of them replace Bitcoin. I say extremely and not just highly, because [this]( is most likely to happen if an altcoin were to ever get close. The main ledger is where the value is. Alt-protocols will be assimilated into the WWL if they ever for some reason become superior.

Or maybe she'll let you give her a toy or something instead of doing the dishes, then everyone will say your debt is canceled. Or maybe even I will do something for your sister and she will be in the clear, then later I'll have you do something for me and you can be in the clear. We could even have a chart on the fridge where we put magnets next to a person's name if they did something for someone. You would have moved a magnet from your name to your sister's name, then from her to me. Later I would give you your magnet back if you did something for me.  It's a way of keeping track of who did what. But if our family were really big, it would get really hard to remember who owes what, right? And maybe some people would cheat by secretly moving the magnets when no one was around. Bitcoin is a computer system for keeping track of that for the whole world, and it uses some special math that makes it impossible to cheat."
Bonus points for actually setting up such a system on the fridge.

Good point, but the larger problem, which I think the community will ultimately come to realize, is that we have the best mechanism known to civilization for deciding things like this - the market - and we are ditching it in favor of wonky voting schemes. I should say "trying to ditch it," though, because the market always has the last word. If and when the voting mechanism fails to maximize value, the market will birth a new fork that does. 
Through arbitrage of the forks on exchanges, among the constant parade of sundry forks that are being thrown by the wayside daily in the future (sold off as soon as they appear), a fork that the market actually supports more than the failed voting mechanism will appear and investment value will converge on it in minutes or hours, and lo we have a new market-chosen fork. A new market-chosen cap or scheme for controlling the cap.
The market [always wins]( anyway, at least once the importance of the fork arbitraging process is inevitability recognized by the community at large, so insofar as they are imperfect, schemes like BIP100 simply function as stopgap measures until then (only if BIP100 happens to get it completely right will the market stick with it).

People can witch hunt Mike all they want. The endlessly forkable nature of the collection of code makes people and personalities and political views irrelevant.

And The Thing Which Must Not Be Named is a big step in that direction.
 I don't give a rip if bleetin' Barack Obama is the one to write the 8MB block increase. It will be reviewed by the larger community, which is what almost everyone is already relying on for their trust in the existing implementation anyway (not trust in the Core commissars), and then people will cautiously wait for a while and try it out.

There is no safe option in the face of competition, so safety cannot be the issue. Some risk is baked in, whether you take that risk by being too conservative or too experimental. The game is to try to find the best balance given the competition. A risk that is just risky enough to balance the risk of being overtaken with the risk of running into technical problems. It would be quite a remarkable coincidence if staying anywhere near 1MB turned out to be that ideal level of risk.

The name Core, obviously. I mean, it's clearly the core of Bitcoin just by the title. /s
Fast forward to 2020: all the implementations are named things like Bitcoin Reference, Bitcoin Backbone, Bitcoin Standard Edition, etc. 
Equating Core (or even XT if it becomes the popular implementation) with Bitcoin and requiring consensus in Core to make changes is a centralist paradigm because it implies that the Core committers are the anointed ones.  
I also like how theymos talks about consensus among experts and says, "Those 12 people are everyone with expert flare." Yeah, and who gave them that flare? Circular reasoning pervades the entire argument.

@_date: 2015-08-10 22:56:48


This is fuzzy thinking. Consensus among *whom* for change of *what*? 
Change of Bitcoin? What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin Core? OK, but Bitcoin is not Bitcoin Core in general, only de facto at this point in time. 
Consensus among the Core committers? Other Core devs? All Bitcoin devs? Miners? Users? Exchanges? Investors? Merchants? Venture capitalists? All of the above? 
Consensus among *someone* is indeed a prerequisite for a cryptocurrency, but for most practical purposes the Bitcoin that matters will be the one that is most valuable, meaning it is largely the investors who decide. You don't need a consensus among all investors, though, just among some of them - enough to push the market cap of the popular version of Bitcoin far above the rest, which immediately snowballs. 
So we see that this vague idea of "consensus needed for change" is a complete red herring. No consensus among any predetermined group is needed for change at all, despite the fact that some kind of consensus will be what forms what will be called Bitcoin. 
This is quite fortunate, of course, because if consensus (among just about any predetermined subset of the abovementioned stakeholders) were actually needed for all changes going forward, Bitcoin would have no future. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 05:35:42
Seems like this is practically a daily occurrence now. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 04:07:35
It requires consensus, but not consensus among any preset group. Any group that finds its in consensus on a ledger-updating protocol for what we now call the Bitcoin ledger will be able to operate. If people sell coins in that fork in favor of Core Bitcoins, Core stays relevant and the fork falls by the wayside or is used by a breakaway niche. If not, the same fate befalls Core and it is the new fork that becomes relevant. If later it turns out the winning side was wrong, the people that stuck with the niche will make big money. So place your bets (or not) and welcome to Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:39:36
You're right to point out that calling XT an altcoin is nothing less than a declaration that the Core devs have total control of Bitcoin. At least Theymos admit's XT would become Bitcoin if it were successful, but he keeps shifting the goalposts on what constitutes success. The only goalpost that can matter here is the economic one where XT becomes far more valuable than Core, and that snowballs. Then XT is Bitcoin, for all intents and purposes. But unlike what he is saying, that clearly only requires a strong economic majority, not anywhere near a consensus. By that standard, in fact, Core is looking more and more likely to become the "altcoin" if the Core devs don't get cranking.
@_date: 2015-08-21 19:02:23
This language is far too sloppy:




This centralized thinking belies a complete misunderstanding of Bitcoin and every other open consensus system. Take the standard English language for example. Someone proposed a fork to basic English to use the gender-neutral "vey" as the pronoun for he/she. I doubt this will catch on and I personally find it dumb, but someone with some clout on some forums proposed it. 


In this context it is just as silly. Anyone who wants to use it will use it, and be intelligible only to fellow users of that change. No hostility or forcing.


Just because you need consensus among the speakers of a particular fork to constitute a language does not mean you need consensus to make changes. The majority - most valuable - languages will leave behind any objectors who feel so strongly that they are willing to take the value hit of using a more obscure language version, and that does not ruin credibility at all. Again we find this definitional blur: credibility of what? The protocol for maintaining the WWL can change all over the place and leave objectors in the dust with their tow systems left and right, but the credibility of the WWL won't be affected by merely not having consensus among some preordained group. 
The only way to affect the credibility of the WWL is to mess up the ledger. You might think that an alternative being offered will mess up the ledger if it is adopted, but that is a separate issue from the original claim that forking requires consensus among some preset group. It simply does not, and if fact consensus among a preset group (Core devs, Gavin&amp;Mike, or otherwise) has nothing whatsoever to do with it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:53:49
Taboo the word "altcoin." Can you make the same argument? It's like the mods and some of the small blockers are playing a semantic game where they take advantage of the ambiguity in word "altcoin," interpreting it in a very broad sense that feels like a total stretch when saying that XT is an altcoin, then equivocate back to the narrow definition implicitly when invoking the rule that altcoins are off topic. 
This reminds me of a restaurant owner who says, "Humans are animals, and as the sign says animals aren't allowed in here, so get out," to some kind of person he personally dislikes. Interpreting words in malleable ways as is convenient for one's argument.

See, this is why this keeps being an issue: the Blockstream folks have continually taken exception to even the insinuation that there could be an *incentive* for them to undermine Bitcoin, taking the obviously overreactive position that pointing out an incentive constitutes "accusations" or "defamation." This makes people suspicious, and the whole cycle repeats. 
The smart move would be to acknowledge the incentive, say you're above it and that taking investor money of course has tradeoffs, and move on. Conflict of interest can't be avoided sometimes, and it is not fatal, but to pretend it isn't factor worthy of taking into consideration just leaves an attack surface open for posts like this. And to take umbrage at the mere pointing out of these possibilities, a form of due diligence, only serves to arouse suspicions that perhaps a nerve has been struck.

1) In the face of change (adoption, altcoin competition, regulations), the power to keep Bitcoin from adapting must be called equally as authoritarian.
2) When people can fork and use other implementations, fortunately "authoritarian" only applies in the most superficial sense. Someone has authority for their implementation, but never the authority to force anyone to use it or prevent anyone from forking it.
3) The only real authority is the market, and it can't stop you from using your preferred fork, but it can make it less valuable and therefore less relevant.

"Extreme caution" should also entail caution about being so conservative that you let an altcoin steal all that potential market share during the next surge in adoption. If we are indeed near the real practical limit in blocksize at which a cryptocurrency can function without getting so centralized that it becomes vulnerable, then their brand of "extreme caution" is warranted, but if we are nowhere near it this "extreme caution" is actually extreme folly. 
In other words, the Core committers calling their position one of "extreme caution" is assuming that which they want to prove. It only counts as caution if their weighting of the various threats against Bitcoin is correct. Circular reasoning yet again.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:35:04
They'd only win and split off some of Bitcoin with a temporarily higher market cap, but meanwhile plenty of people will stick with sound money and in a few years when they've ruined the popular fork we can be redeemed.

He's right that your not participating in the "consensus by code," but of course very wrong is saying the blocksize debate doesn't affect you. Of course it does, since you said you HODL and if crippling Bitcoin is allowed the value of your holdings may decrease. Also, your use of transactions in business may get more expensive if the blocksize is kept low. There is some serious, straight-up delusion in Luke's post.
EDIT: This idea of "consensus by code" is a tricky one, so I may have spoken too hastily in Luke's defence there. The consensus by market is all that matters in the end. See my comment [here](
@_date: 2015-08-07 18:53:20
Yes, absolutely and completely. What we call "1 bitcoin" is really just shorthand for one 21 millionth of the total ledger (the total eventual money supply). If the total (non-lost) coins equal 1 BTC, then it will simply be that much smaller amounts like 0.000000005 BTC will constitute 1/21000000th of the total money supply. It's effectively like renaming "cents" to "dollars" and magically shrinking the dollar supply everywhere to 1% of its current amount. It does nothing other than effect a semantic shift.
@_date: 2015-08-09 16:07:01
They already do vote with their bitcoins, at least in the event of an actual hard fork where the winner isn't instantly clear, since exchanges would surely stand ready to let people sell coins in one fork for coins in their preferred fork, thereby sending the value of the disfavored fork's coins very low.

As soon as a viable spinoff exists, there is no economic distinction between "real BTC" and spinoff BTC. In other words, they are both spinoffs in the practical sense. The world will consider whichever one has the overwhelmingly higher market cap to be "real BTC," with little regard for which came first. 
Since this plays out over minutes or hours, if you simply sit tight your coins will be safe since you have equal amounts on both sides of the split. 
For example, if your 10 BTC in the spinoff version are worth $20,000 total and your 10 BTC in the original version are worth a total of $2, you're likely going to make your purchases using the spinoff version. The World Wide Ledger is preserved in any case, so your wealth is unaffected.

At this point, I hope someone releases a version with no limit at all (or user selectable limits) and people can run that if they please. I would, and I'd just make sure to set the limit at least 10x higher than current volume. There would be a kind of chaos of orphaning if miners stepped up and made larger blocks, but as tx pressure increased eventually more people would run more blocksize-permissive nodes and some miners would try making bigger blocks. Who else would be willing to deep-six this debate and just run this?

Well-argued post but ultimately all based on the old saw that "bigger blocks will reduce decentralization," which is by no means a valid assumption. Even if it were, decentralization is a means to the end of achieving invulnerability from attack and from centralized control. Ultra-decentralization coupled with low popularity probably allows for Bitcoin to be attacked/controlled far more readily than "merely high"-decentralization coupled with high popularity. 
Consider how both setups function under the threat of government regulation, for example. Like the Internet, if the system is popular enough and drives enough of the economy soon enough, it cannot be banned for long.
Or consider what would have happened if the Internet had been limited to TOR from the beginning: very free, but extremely slow, therefore not catching on for everyday usage, commerce, or almost any of the wonderful uses to which we put it, so likely to be banned early and stringently, dramatically delaying the benefits it would bring to civilization.

At least your position is clear: is officially about supporting the current popular version of Bitcoin, not about discussion of everything that affects Bitcoin and its future. Realize that this leaves a large opening for a competing subreddit that will function as a one-stop shop for everything a bitcoiner needs to know to stay informed about Bitcoin in general, not just its current popular implementation. 
It's also odd that you opine about the importance of open dialog but feel free to inject *your* contribution to this dialog in the form of modding actions of censorship. 
Finally, I am disappointed to see you completely misunderstand a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin: that the ledger is the currency. XT shares the same ledger as it stands, so at the time of the fork it will *not* qualify as a competing currency. This is perhaps an understandable error since the nature of money is not well-understood by most, but to not merely "have a loud and vociferous opinion" on this aspect of Bitcoin economics, but go so far even as to censor discussion based on it, inspires a disdain greater then even that evident in the famous Rothbard quote.

BIP100's miner voting mechanism is a symptom of the implementation monoculture, which has prevented the obvious *market* decision mechanism of on-exchange fork arbitrage from developing. BIP100 may work, because miners are a sort of proxy for investors in certain ways, but if not then investors will show them what's what. 
And I don't mean sell BTC for an altcoin, but sell their already-held BTC in the disfavored fork to acquire more BTC in their favored fork (with on-exchange "forkbitrage" as described by several people recently). The quickest on the draw can easily double their bitcoins this way, so the incentive is huge.

Not sure why you got downvoted. In a few years, if not sooner, it will be abundantly clear looking back that hard forks should be daily occurrences, though only occasionally - whenever absolutely necessary - will the market support them. The idea that hard forking will get harder in the future is an illusion that is due solely to the fact that we've had a monoculture of implementations so far. 
Once this huge centralization risk is remedied and we have a plurality of implementations, hard forking will not be seen as getting more difficult (because it won't be dependent on an ever more ossified Core committer group), but rather hard forking will happen on exactly those occasions when the market deems the risk of bugs and potential loss of network effects worth it. Naturally this will be rather infrequent, but it will happen whenever absolutely necessary for the maximization of Bitcoin's long-term value and viability.

It seems you're stuck in the old way of thinking. With a plurality of implementations, you never have to accept any one person or group's upgrade. In fact, having a choice besides Core - even if one man gets to decide what is offered under that brand name - is in fact the very opposite of what you suggest. It is more freedom rather than less. 
Until now, if you wanted to use a well-reviewed version of full Bitcoin or upgrade your client node, you were pretty much are stuck with Core, which is controlled by 5 people. Now you have a second major option. It's possible that Core doesn't go along with the blocksize cap change and all the Core devs quit and Core goes defunct, and we'd be back to a monoculture, but that seems unlikely.

Last minute scaling in a candidate for global money, where adoption tends to happen in gigantic groundswells, is a terrible idea, especially with all those bigger block altcoins circling like vultures overhead, waiting for just such an opportunity to steal Bitcoin's lunch.
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:04:37
This belies a complete misunderstanding of where the constancy of Bitcoin and its important parameters comes from. The myth, even among many of the developers, is that it is only by their conservatism and veto power that Bitcoin maintains these important parameters; to them it is nothing more than the Core committers' careful stewardship that prevents the unwashed masses of bitcoiners from doing silly things like raising the 21M coin limit. This is a complete illusion, except in the superficial and entirely pointless sense that sure, if anyone could change Core, Core would be unreliable and any fork that stayed with Core would become worthless. 
By equivocating between the terms Core and Bitcoin, people have fooled themselves into thinking that Core committers and the implementation monoculture are what keep Bitcoin in line, when really it is the investors and other stakeholders. If a fork represents a reduction in value, it will fail on the market - in fact the threat of such summary dismissal by investors tends to nip such half-baked proposals in the bud. Not the veto power of the Core devs! 
When we have a real issue where it is quite possible that a fork away from Core will provide more value, for the first time such a fork appears and may gain attention. That is why the things (to remain nameless in accordance with subreddit rules) that are happening are happening. In such a case, the Core devs are powerless to stop it, except by compromising toward it so as to disincentivise people from making the switch. 
The investors have the control. The investors will not support a change in coin issuance, because that would be horrifically value-reducing. They will support, in the form of a prediction-market-like distillation of  the best wisdom on the subject, the fork that provides more value. They will bid up the price of the more valuable fork and bid down the price of the less valuable one, whether Core or not.
That is where Bitcoin's usual conservatism and consistency really arises from.
This applies to implementations in general, not merely specifically about any current events.

If true, this puts the final nail in the coffin of the objections against the $21 million conflict of interest: "but small blocks has been our position all along" and "we need bigger blocks for LN, too." Just because LN eventually will need bigger blocks doesn't mean Blockstream won't benefit from smaller blocks right now. After all, why bother using LN (or sidechains for that matter) if Bitcoin still has the capacity to handle everything for the foreseeable future?
@_date: 2015-08-30 02:20:17
Good points. It's a collective action problem. Individual miners prefer smaller blocks short-term, though they would stand to make more money as a group if the limit were raised, since adoption would be allowed to increase to the point where fees could become significant revenue. BIP100 distorts the checks and balances, and is an odd thing to get support given mining centralization is already one of the biggest concerns.
@_date: 2015-08-16 08:28:45
It's a conflict of interest all right. Whether it is being abused is another story. For example, everyone who holds BTC has a conflict of interest when discussing whether Bitcoin is a good investment. Conflict of interest is merely a fact of the way interests overlap; it is not a death sentence, but neither is it something to be dismissed out of hand. 
The fact that some continue to dismiss their conflict of interest out of hand is why the point keeps getting hammered on.

To be fair, wallets of the future would make dealing with multiple alt-ledgers so easy that the user would barely notice. However, no altcoin is going to get to be silver or copper to Bitcoin's gold. Rather, if any altcoin starts to take such a position, its protocol will get repurposed to maintain the *Bitcoin* ledger instead of its altcoin ledger. From that point onward the ledgers will start to diverge, but current investors in BTC will hold an equal percentage of both by default automatically so they won't care. Even a paper wallet from years ago buried in the ground will be valid for both. New investors are the only ones that will have to make a choice about which coin to invest in, and whichever one they do invest in the original Bitcoin investors benefit.
From a current investor's perspective, all ya gots to do is get on the WWL.

Unless you have a large portion of the hashing power doing that, the effect would be minimal: maybe a delay to the next block every few blocks. Other miners can take all the fee gravy that the attacking miner misses. And it would be easy to tell which mining pool(s) were doing it, so miners would pull out of them, shrinking them to nothing in short order.

I came here expecting some kind of amazing weakness in brainwallets, but it appears this is just the age-old criticism (though a valid one) that many average-Joe users will not generate enough entropy in their passphrase if they don't receive the proper instruction, and so it is irresponsible to have up a site like brainwallet.org where they can so easily create a brainwallet without the necessary understanding. 
This has nothing to do with the typical 16-word brainwallet where people choose words from a large word list by rolling dice or something like that. It's just that a significant number of people end up thinking "correct horse battery staple" or "gimme da loot" or a hash of the entire Bible are high entropy. There are a lot of pitfalls to creating a high-entropy passphrase, but that doesn't at all mean that people can't be instructed on how to do it correctly.

Some are arguing for changing the 21M limit, but just about every idiotic idea has been bandied about in Bitcoin. Parent's point is about what gains traction. Bitcoin is determined by investors' assessment of what maximizes the value of the ledger. Gesticulating at the 21M limit like it could fall just as easily "because it's also an economic limit" is a totally desperate move and says more about the arguer than anything. The fact that such a flimsy argument is being repeated in some circles should be a red flag for the credibility of those circles.

I've been following it since 2012. The 100x bull run in 2013 was super intense. Here's a [memoir]( of the first half of it. The more you study history, the more money you will make in the crazy bull runs. 
My thoughts are the following: 
Bitcoin has actually been in a bull market since 2012. The trick is, by "Bitcoin" I mean the ecosystem as a whole. In 2014, while the price tanked, mining investment had an epic run-up. In 2014 and moreso in 2015 venture capital is through the roof despite a languishing price. Since the historic bull run of 2013, huge money has been continually pumped into the Bitcoin *ecosystem* just not the coins themselves, presumably because people considered them overbought. 
But those money spigots have been flowing non-stop for years, so there is no particular reason to expect them to stop. Mining has topped out, and from about half a year ago money really got focused into [venture capital]( to build out infrastructure. That too will be topping out soon, if not already.
Then where do those money spigots turn? To the only thing that isn't over-invested into - the price.
And keep in mind that at current prices about $1 million of BTC is mined daily, so even keeping the price stable requires roughly $1 million of new money to be invested every single day. Therefore, there is a little trick to looking at the price: when the price gets stable for a while after an extended correction, it's like a turning point has been reached. At that point, the daily $1M outflow is matched by a daily $1M inflow. That has usually meant that "the bottom is in." See Azop's [Stability Thesis]( which predicted the recent rise perfectly.
Now to take it back to common sense, where is the price now and where is Bitcoin itself in terms of maturity? The price is roughly where it was 2 years ago. Is Bitcoin at the same maturity level as 2 years ago? Not at all. It is perhaps 20 to 50 times as mature now. It was hardly taken seriously at all then. You'd need to go back into the archives to verify this, but that is an extremely worthwhile endeavor and if you are an investor it will be some of the highest paid hours you will ever "work." Take a look at what people were excited by back then, and then come back and see how far we have come. There is a *lot* of spectacular news to price in, and people are jaded by the bear market so that even if great news arrives they are not expecting a rally. They are despondent/depressed, maybe guardedly hopeful. Look what point that is on the [cycle of market emotions]( the point of maximum opportunity. 
So I think it's time for a big correction to the upside. It will be highly volatile, and emotionally it will be a complete roller coaster, as it always is (see the memoir). The more you can learn about the mindset of "sitting tight" as legendary stock market trader Jesse Livermore would tell you, the more money you can make in these bull runs. To really get the point, read [this whole thread]( Again, highly paid working hours. 
Best of luck :)

Indeed. It's like this weird fetish or sacred cow that has been kept on with all sorts of handwaving justifications for why it could be dangerous to remove it. Meanwhile keeping it could be dangerous for Bitcoin's viability, and no handwaving is required for that: if bigger blocks *don't* turn out to significantly harm decentralization, an altcoin with bigger blocks will come snatch up most of the market share during the next adoption surge. Suddenly Bitcoin would be rendered irrelevant. Now that's a *real* danger, unlike all these "how many miners can dance on the head of a pin" pontifications.

I agree with this. To me it seems like a smaller increase would be nice exploratory feeler so we can find out a lot more about how justified various fears are, but at low risk. If we raise to 2MB for example, and it turns out it's not at all an issue and doesn't really do much to decentralization, we can probably get another increase to 4 or 8MB  quickly thereafter because there will be far less opposition. If it turns out to be quite bad, then of course we will soft fork back down and most of us big-blockers will rethink our views; forking will then be far less likely. Either way we are in a much better position than now.  
EDIT: However, the benefit to the big jump is it actually creates the necessary controversy to help fix the implementation monoculture, which is another big centralization risk. It's short-term somewhat riskier, but it gets two birds with one stone in terms of longer term risk mitigation.

This is a common misconception, again thanks to the infamous blockchain.info and to the misapprehension that Bitcoin is mainly a payment system rather than mainly a wealth storage system. 
The block reward goes toward not only securing the transactions that do occur every ~10 minutes, but also securing the value of the coins that *don't* move during that ~10 minutes. In fact the lion's share of Bitcoin's market cap owes to its store-of-value properties, which are secured by that same block reward. It's the ability to transact securely that ensures the rest of the coins retain their value.
You might then say that Bitcoin costs money to hold, but that is just another way of saying that Bitcoin has an inflation schedule - a fact which everyone is already keenly aware of. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:18:53
Exactly. Logically, it's  the fallacy of begging the question, assuming that which you aim to prove, circular reasoning. Mining is only wasteful if there is a more efficient way to accomplish the same thing. To show that mining is wasteful necessarily requires showing that a more efficient method exists. You can't call it wasteful until that has been solidly established, which it hasn't.

It qualifies as limiting Bitcoin to much less than it could be, and allowing another system to take the golden chalice from its hands, and maybe to supersede it entirely (which would be destroying it). 
While I think it unlikely, it's conceivable that Bitcoin-like systems only work with small blocks. In that case, Bitcoin can remain king of the cryptos and will serve as a bedrock settlement system on top of which other things are built. But so can Litecoin, or many others. 
If Bitcoin wants to retain its network effect, it can't afford to be as over-conservative as some would like. It has to take some risks, with the knowledge that even a big failure would not destroy it. It has to aim for as big as it can be. It has to take some leaps of faith. And in fact leaving the 1MB limit in is just as much of a leap of faith, though a much more complicated one given all the spaghetti code that seems to be required to deal with that arbitrary economic interference.

As far as I've seen, the well-reasoned comments that the majority of people highly disagree with (such as most of those by Greg Maxwell) have been carefully maintained at a score of 1 precisely because people are aware that downvoting decent points by the opposition smells like an unfair agenda. 
Maybe *your* favorite posts and comments have been downvoted, but maybe they were not well argued, maybe they were repeating points that had been made before, or maybe they were fine but irrelevant to the context. Show some examples, because this "dissenters are silenced by downvoting" platitude seems not to hold up to scrutiny. I and I'm sure many others watch threads looking out for this specifically. I see it occasionally, but on both sides of the debate, and certainly it has not kept the main points of the opposition from being well known to readers. On the contrary, we want to know their best points so we can refute them - if we don't and just downvote them, we (unlike the mods, apparently) know that will merely result in people seeing the arguments elsewhere, without the benefit of our rebuttals.

The controversy is all part of the necessary evolution to get Bitcoin to the fully unassailable position it needs to be in for its next stage of growth. If it weren't the blocksize it would be something else; the implementation monoculture needs to be broken before the World Wide Ledger can enter the big leagues. Dev control must be decentralized.

If you think hard forking is that difficult, that bias will form a lens that colors your perception of every aspect of the debate.

The belief that 1MB is enough for Bitcoin to operate is insufficient to make maintaining 1MB a good idea. If any altcoin can do substantially* better, Bitcoin just bleeds market share until people come to their senses.
*Only marginally better would not be enough to overcome Bitcoin's network effects, but 10x or 100x better would be.

Yep, the gilded post is soooo several months ago in terms of nuance. The question of whether raising the blocksize cap to the degrees being talked about really harms decentralization (and especially the benefits we get from decentralization) is the very crux of the issue. It's not something to sweep under the rug as a starting assumption then truck along tut-tutting about the importance of decentralization.
 With very few exceptions, the people advocating larger blocksize caps are well, well aware of the immense importance of decentralization, and that it absolutely cannot be sacrificed. However, there are both legitimate questions as far as how much decentralization is enough *and* whether bigger blocks would actually lead to less or more decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:02:03
Came here to say this. That's what regulation *is*. Big corporations and other special interests lobby government officials for protections and other benefits for themselves. These benefits are created by instating laws that effect the desired result for the favored special interest. The resulting laws are collectively called regulation. The "public good" is just the sales pitch.

Not at all. Ancap is a form of governance without a monopoly government. Call the maintainer a benevolent dictator or whatever, but they only dictate on their own implementation, which anyone can fork at any time, and everyone should be waiting several weeks or months to download each of their new versions so that they can be vetted. It's not a monopoly, which makes all the difference.
@_date: 2015-08-29 02:11:00
False dichotomy. Once exchanges allow you to sell your BTC in the fork(s) you don't like and buy more BTC in the fork you do like, exit just means moving to a different Bitcoin implementation. The World Wide Ledger is preserved. Maxwell's "something else" need not be anything other than another version of Bitcoin. 
You can change transport layer protocols (allowable blocksize) without changing the ledger or the monetary properties at all.

Also, you don't need to go so far. All that needs to happen is for a few major exchanges to set their system up to allow people to sell coins in one fork for coins in the other. Then the process should play out in a few minutes or hours at most, because of the extreme dynamics toward convergence on whatever looks like it will be the winning fork. The remaining fork would become either an altcoin with less than 10% of Bitcoin's market cap, or just a dead fork (less than a few million dollars in market cap, like not even a top ten altcoin).

That's exactly what gold is. A low-tech version of Bitcoin. It's a distributed ledger system where you have to physically pass around pieces of metal to change the ledger.

Wallet creators need to step up here.

It doesn't solve them, but it absolutely helps. A lot. Prices going from negligible to "non-negligible for some purposes but still tiny" could easily reduce transaction counts by tenfold or more. 10MB blocks and modestly higher fees together could mean 100x or even 1000x more free space for transactions.
So yeah, if enough people wanna pay a higher fee, sure, but that suggests much higher levels of adoption.
@_date: 2015-07-08 22:24:04

And that's just venture capital. Double that can be expected if price holds, since that's roughly the cost to be paid into mining for the price to remain as it is. If the price goes up, of course, we could be talking orders of magnitude more than that.

Accepted by whom? And how is creating an alternative for people to choose from "demanding to get your way"?
What you're calling the standard method is a centralized process with gatekeepers in an implementation monoculture. It may have been standard up to now, but it's arguably the biggest centralization risk Bitcoin has right now. The fact that other implementations are now on the table, irrespective of whether the particular one being discussed is actually better or worse than Core, is a welcome and indeed essential development for decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 22:34:40


You're equivocating on the term "economic property." The coin limit is an actual economic property of the ledger, whereas the blocksize cap could be called "economic" only in the more oblique sense that there exist economic considerations in mining. It has nothing to do with what users of the money would consider an economic property. To conflate these two is simply obfuscation in an attempt to imbue the blocksize limit with a special status that somehow makes it worthy of being "set in stone." 
@_date: 2015-07-05 08:49:14
Physical goods and a software protocol are fundamentally different. Moreover, from an investment perspective, even if a completely new protocol has to be built from the ground up, the ledger can be maintained (through spinoffs or sidechains) so investors have (almost) nothing to worry about. They can buy BTC and if the concept catches on in *any* form it is most likely that the WWL will be preserved and their cut of the 21M money stock will remain the same.

Never heard of torts? Torts are part of customary law, which evolved in a quasi-market process with no central planning. The "regulation" we are speaking of here, as well as all legislation, is centrally planned law by bureaucrats, and is completely different than customary law which consists of those judgments in individual instances of case law that were found by experience to effectively reduce the level of violence in society. 
Suing the seller is the obvious solution here, and serves as a much greater deterrent than regulations that, again, are only ever incidentally serving of the stated end since the real goal is to help some interest group.

A spike, yes, but a sustained major increase would slam us against a brick wall.

This reasoning is like saying, in a country where your firstborn must be sent to the government or else your whole family faces execution, "the free market prefers sending of firstborns" just because people will generally fair better if they comply.

The only thing you really need to know  as a long term investor is 
1) If Bitcoin succeeds it will be going to at least a million dollars per coin. Some people say 100K. Fine, either way.
2) If it doesn't maintain a rapid rate of progress in aspects other than the price, it will not succeed. It has in fact maintained a blistering rate of progress, even during the 1.5-year bear market.
3) If it progresses, sooner or later the price must follow. For the past 1.5 years, an amazing run-up in mining investment and venture capital investment (infrastructure buildout) have absorbed almost all the money that would have gone into price. There will be a reckoning wherein the price has its turn at the run-up, if Bitcoin is to succeed.
4) That reckoning may be upon us.

This goalpost-shift to "what fraction of nodes can be operated undetectably" runs afoul of the overarching consideration that some governments could ban Bitcoin. If a government is breaking down doors for full nodes, they've probably already banned it entirely.

It creates an opening for other governments to take advantage.

Requiring a seller introduces centralization. The whole point of the Counterparty burn was to distribute the tokens in a fair, decentralized way. If Bitcoin didn't exist, the only way to do this would have been mining. Since Bitcoin already exists, this can be done without using any energy in the real world (mining), so of course it should be. Despite the name, burning BTC just moves money around. It doesn't consume any real world resource.

The price either rises a lot when the Core devs get cracking and up the size substantially, or rises astronomically if the implementation monoculture is broken and the market fork arbitrage system (as Meni Rosenfeld and Daniel Krawisz have described) is fully internalized. But the latter will take longer.
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:14:44
Thanks for the clarification. I don't see a risk in the possibility of the network splitting in two, as long as the market is the means of determining which fork(s) succeed. Either the market chooses a side and values coins on that fork with a high price and coins on the other fork with an insignificant price, relegating it to the dustbin, or - though I think extremely unlikely due to the market's high valuation of network effects - the market gives both versions substantial value and we get a split. 
Since I personally trust the market, I can only conclude that this unlikely situation would be one where the benefits of the split somehow actually outweigh the costs (such as if Bitcoin turns out to need to divide into an extremely decentralized settlement network and a less-decentralized payment network). 
Either way, it is not a bad situation provided you trust that the market mechanism is the wisest one. And even if you don't, the market always has the last word, vetoing anything it doesn't like and supporting whatever it does like, by changing the prices. 
So I believe we are in a situation where any fork introduced will be fine because the market will choose wisely on it, and even if the market cannot be trusted to choose wisely there is nothing to be done about it anyway. For example, many may fear that the market will support a huge block fork and sell off coins in the small block fork so much that the price of coins in the small block fork falls below, say, a penny. If that were to happen, no one can do anything about it from a technical angle. All they can do if they want to stick with small blocks is to  hodl those small block coins, sell their coins in the mega-block fork, and hope mega-block Bitcoin meets an unfortunate security calamity, in which case they stand to make incredible amounts of money as the market realizes its mistake. 
Point is, the market is always right, and even when the market is wrong it is always in control - and it doesn't operate by consensus but by popularity weighted by how much people really care and how certain they feel (and how right they've been in the past, insofar as wealth is a proxy for that).
EDIT: However, our views may be closer than they appear, inasmuch as it could be argued that the market will value consensus most highly. I think the contribition I make here is to point out that the market will move forward with the option it deems most valuable even if no real consensus can be reached in time. I think the market will prefer to wait for consensus while it judges the situation not to be urgent, but once it decides the situation is urgent it will go forward with a value convergence on its preferred fork, with or without any particular standard of consensus having been reached. (Of course if the consensus is completely lacking *and* people feel strongly enough about it *and* a split is really deemed as the best way to maximize value, the market will support a split.)

Anyone who understands Bitcoin's economics could have predicted spending is way down since the bubble. Bitcoin is still very much an investment. Most spending so far has merely been as an alternative, more efficient way of selling BTC on exchanges to rebalance investor portfolios as the price rises. When the price falls there is no such reason to spend, so people will only spend in those cases where it is the clearly best option or the only option (dark markets).

I am not totally sure about the matter of "rejecting the truck full of hard drives." It seems like something gmax would come in and say, "If we could do that, we wouldn't need a blockchain," though maybe there is a limit to how far that point goes.
On the question of whether it's political, I personally don't highly doubt the motivations of the BS crew, but their conflict of interest cannot be dismissed entirely either (and for Adam specifically, he basically is a part inventor of Bitcoin yet missed its potential (and financial gains) until very late; that has to be a strange dynamic in his mind). I think rather they are very narrowly code-focused, as one might expect from coders, and have a comparatively weak understanding of economics and the general human incentives, tending at times to see people like robots and use the passive voice and make a lot of correlation-based arguments (Gmax: "every indicator of network health I can think of has decreased almost monotonically as blocksizes have increased" (inexact quote from memory)). They tend to take a dimmer view of what is possible for Bitcoin proper, which reminds me of how people tend to take a dim view of what the free market can do. It reminds me of Bastiat/Hazlitt: "Everyone can see the beautiful new bridge the government created so many jobs in building, but no one can see all the other things that could have been built with those resources, because they have never been allowed to come into existence" is somewhat like, "Everyone can see the blocksize limit and how it prevents all these attacks and is the last bastion of hope at staving off further declines in node count, but no one can see all the innovations and careful profit-loss based decisions and norms that would have come about in its absence, because they have never been permitted to come into existence." 
Or just take Hayek: "The curious task of economics is to show men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design." Unleashing the antifragility and economic innovation of each actor working in their own interest is underrated by people in general, but by coders to a greater degree usually because they are by default central planners. However, in Bitcoin the line is hard to draw because some examples of "leaving it to the market" result in Bitcoin being replaced by an altcoin or getting killed somehow (piecemeal removal of market strictures can result in other still-existing market strictures coming to the fore and breaking things). The context and Szabo's "large vs. small games" must be kept in mind.
So I think the situation is rather nuanced, with a lot of it being the familiar tropes of central planning fallacies, humans as robots, coders gonna code ("simple solutions not always preferred because it leaves us coders with a less important role"), *cui bono?* or follow the money, and plain old careerism and human obstruction and conservatism (note how so many amateur hour aspects of Bitcoin have died out and been replaced (MtGox and all the early services) as Bitcoin becomes exponentially more of a bigtime thing, while the devs haven't so much
...shouldn't Bitcoin be attracting ever more world-class talent? Rusty is a counterexample, though, and I don't mean to imply people like Gmax aren't world class - I think he likely is, can't speak to the rest because I'm not as familiar with them).

Fortunately it doesn't work that way. Risk-reward on the way up (and down) ensures that most early adopters sell almost all of their coins. A commonly cited figure is 17% at each doubling, which very soon in Bitcoin's huge  bull runs amounts to "almost all."
 Since the 10000BTC pizza days my that would mean only about 5% of the initial BTC holdings would remain. And we're still only halfway from there toward mainstream adoption prices.  By the way, this is assuming you never panicked, never got overly greedy/impatient, and managed to handle your new-found wealth smartly, which most people don't do (see the many sad stories of lottery winners).

Doesn't necessarily follow. One could just as easily say it discourages decentralization by preventing Bitcoin adoption, which would naturally result in more people willing or needing to run full nodes even if the costs were higher (even a trivial inconvenience is too much for most people anyway; full node operators were always going to be basically limited to those who are either altruistic or had a pressing need to run a full node, except before when everyone had to run a full node because there were no SPV wallets).


Apparently not, looking at the stress tests. Bigger blocks would allow that spam to be processed, forcing the spammer to pay for it.


One can just as easily say that "having the cap much higher than usual transaction volume" is the devil we know, and that full blocks are the real uncharted territory.


Agreed. 


Or not, since this point is contingent on the "devil we know" point.


Theoretical. (Besides, if the huge blocks don't propagate to enough of the network, they'll be orphaned. At worst they could cut out just under half the network for few blocks, then probably individual miners would tilt away from them and they'd start being orphaned. Even if individual miners take their time in doing this, you can't just keep hacking away 49% again and again, concentrating the cartel. Mining seems a longer term investment than that, give all the sunk costs, so the rest of the network will keep on hashing for weeks/months, but if you disagree I'll defer to your judgment there since you seem to be into mining.)


It's a partial answer. If blocks can be 20MB without issue, keeping them at 1MB compounds the scaling problem 20-fold for no reason.

Increasing the limit at the same rate bandwidth grows already assumes that we're currently at the magic Goldilocks "just right for the current state of tech" size of 1MB. That would be a remarkable coincidence. What if the actual optimal number is 5MB or 10MB? Then we'd want to let it grow in line with bandwidth growth from a point 5x or 10x higher, or else an altcoin will gladly do that in Bitcoin's stead.

The argument is that even allowing small transactions to be fractionally reserved keeps bank-like entities in control of the economy.

We need both, but rationalization of fees at this point allows for a much greater increase in adoption than 8MB blocks would. The fact is, there's still very little transaction volume for Bitcoin's most vital uses, the ones that, say, Greeks looking to avoid capital controls will care about. Store of value doesn't require many transactions, nor do the transactions have to be fast. A slight fee increase would price out the bottom 90% or so of low-priority (from the sender's perspective, not an objective judgment about validity) uses, freeing up a ton of space for new adopters. Together, the block increase and rational fee markets would allow for a huge increase in adoption like we might expect from the next surge. Something like 100-500fold would be my ballpark guess.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:19:12
If the transaction fees are lower, then wallets paying the current fees would get all transactions through automatically. 
20MB really is 20x harder, because for any given fee (suppose the current default in popular wallets) you have to broadcast enough transactions *at that fee* to delay typical user transactions. 20MB makes that cost 20x the amount.
EDIT: And actually this is still wrong, in fact if blocks are 90% full the cost is almost **200x** more to spam the blocks to being full versus if the blocksize is raised to 20MB. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 17:44:46

Si is the way to write in it kunrei-shiki, which is one system of romanization. Shi is the Hepburn romanization, which is much more popular in the West for obvious reasons. The reason kunrei-shiki has some popularity in Japan is that it reflects Japanese morphology* better and only takes two letters for any character. Hepburn is popular in the West just because it's easier for an English speaker to guess the approximate sound. (Mt. Fuji is easier to read approximately correctly for an English speaker than Mt. Huzi, which is the kunrei-shiki version.)
*Japanese people wonder why the Hepburn-shiki "sa shi su se so" set of sounds in Japanese has an sh for the second sound only. The kunrei-shiki "sa si su se so" looks more consistent. Same with "ha hi fu he ho" vs. "ha hi hu he ho." It is just (marginally) easier for a native Japanese speaker to write because they don't really have much of a sense of the fu or shi sound as being of a different type than the rest.

Bitcoin is liable to go absolutely apeshit daily. Don't pay attention at all to the short-term noise. "Markets don't move in straight lines." Repeat it to yourself whenever things look dicey, which will be *very* often if we go up like in 2013. Take a close look at the chart in 2013, when the price went up 100x, or 10000%. Familiarize yourself with the [logarithmic charts]( which are the only type of chart that is appropriate for view exponential growth assets. Note how many huge knifedowns there were, and not what happened afterward. Think of how you would have felt during those dips, not knowing the future.
If you buy bitcoins, expect to look at the price every few weeks, not daily. If the price is on the move, you can always set price alerts that will mail you if the price changes past a certain level. Daily fluctuations are almost completely noise. If you must look, always sterilize your associations by zooming out. If you look at the 1-day chart, be sure to look at the 1-week and the 1-month and the 1-year as well. This will make you money.

No reason to switch until it becomes clear that Core won't budge. Switching to XT is a last resort, Mike Hearn is not popular, bigger blocks is one thing but XT is another. I suspect Gavin's idea to switch to XT is more a negotiating tactic than a serious proposal.

Sell to whom? Destroying money doesn't destroy any real world resource. All it does is transfer purchasing power to everyone else.
In fact, if I burn 10 BTC for a token, I'm effectively "buying" the token from the rest of the BTC holders in the world although it's an unusual purchase since they never had the token themselves and they also cannot refuse the sale. 
I effectively say, "I value this token enough to donate a total of 10 BTC to all you BTC holders in order to obtain it, of course because I think when you guys wake up and realize how valuable this token is you will be willing to pay even more than 10 BTC for it."

Great quote, applicable to just about every field. People are chronically blinded by what they think they already know: about money, economics, science, the opposite sex, whatever.

Yes, they have proven themselves as tremendous optimizers, but the only one who has any cred as a visionary or designer of incentives - at all - is Satoshi. They are Bitcoin maintainers, not Bitcoin designers. It is any surprise that they tend to maintain, even in the very narrow code-focused sense (maintain the 1MB cap) rather than in the larger sense of how Bitcoin interacts with the world (maintain "blocksize &lt;&lt; cap")?

How? The hypothesis is that the entire world uses Bitcoin for its money. In that case, of course, if you have 1 BTC you can go out and buy a whole shitload of goods and services, since you have 0.000007% of all the money in the economy. That's what I mean by command: you can basically say, "Hey you, give me a massage. Here's 0.0000000001 BTC. Hey you, build me a giant shark tank. Here's 0.0000001 BTC." And so on.

Perfect. Making a compelling system comes logically before worrying about how much people will sacrifice to support that system. Burden to operate a node is by itself not such a relevant metric. The one that matters is burden vs. benefit. Keeping the burden as low as possible is not helpful if it hinders the benefit to such a degree that the cost-benefit analysis doesn't motivate as many people to run Bitcoin nodes as those of a competitor. 
Limiting blocksize to increase full node count is like a guy telling chicks he's easy and always available at their beck and call in order to avoid deterring any quality women who may be interested in him. Women don't date a guy because he's more available than average, and people won't run nodes just because it's easier. 
It's been a long time since people ran nodes by default; now people run them because the benefits are worth the costs. How many people can so benefit from a 3 TPS network they are willing to run a full node, even if the cost is moderate? In contrast, with a 100 or 1000 TPS network how many more people will be willing find net benefit in running a full node, even if it is a lot more resource-intensive?

Smallness is no guarantee of decentralization. 
Edit to clarify: Graphwise a bigger-block Bitcoin it may be more centralized, but in terms of the original reasons why we want Bitcoin to be decentralized, bigger is better. If Bitcoin had 4x the adopters but only half the number of full nodes per adopter, that's still a doubling of full nodes. Graphwise it is more centralized, but it's actually *harder* to shut down or control. To spell out the conclusion, more transaction capacity enables greater adoption, which means more full nodes. Or at least, it's not at all obvious that the opposite would be the case.

Interesting idea. While we're throwing spaghetti at the wall, I've always wondered if a kind of mining insurance couldn't fix the variance issue of the block reward. 
If (big if) there were a way to prove you are hashing at a certain rate on the current puzzle, and you could get paid through a payment channel by the millisecond for each attempt, you could have insurance providers get the block reward if you find it, and if not you get a slightly lower payout from the insurance provider. This could be set up through smart contracts in an insurance market, so that anyone could make a few percent on their money by depositing it into the insurance program, much like a bank account. Then risk would be pooled, but mining would not be, because the pool wouldn't be centralized.

Hey, it's their argument, not mine. The context here is that the Blockstream folks have been denying charges of conflict of interest "because we have held the small block position all along." But this is an odd objection because it is nevertheless the case that their $21 million in funding is likely happier if sidechains (and now LN, which is an extension of the hub-and-spoke idea that has been around for much longer) is more urgently needed, which is clearly the case if Bitcoin is limited to 1MB.

It's kind of disturbing that you seem to think the moderation style is what sets the topic of the sub. The linked article would have gotten minimal upvotes and probably not made it to the front page, but a major news article about Ethereum would and should get traction here. Not because Ethereum deserves attention, but because Bitcoin enthusiasts generally want to stay at least minimally informed about major competing (or cooperating) platforms in the space, since developments there have the potential to affect Bitcoin.
A total shutout of even the biggest news about the biggest altcoins has the reverse effect from the one intended: when subscribers hear of major news after the fact from elsewhere, they realize is a cloistered bubble and that they will at least need to subscribe to and check other subreddits to stay informed of all news that affects Bitcoin.
Bottom line: this sub should be a one-stop shop for everything that affects Bitcoin, and *major* news about competitors falls into that category. I believe this is the general sentiment here and the crowd should be expected to have a better judgment of relevance than any mod (especially using wooden criteria like whether it mentions Bitcoin). If this sub starts turning into perhaps there would be grounds for reassessment. But there is no reason to suspect that would happen. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:01:46
Who cares about unfair? What matters is that a competing platform can be made resilient and sufficiently decentralized with nodes limited to those fast Internet countries, and provide astronomically higher TPS than no-node-left-behind Bitcoin Core. As it gains in popularity because of many, many times greater capacity, it ironically becomes even more decentralized than Bitcoin. 
History will marvel at how Bitcoin Core cut off its own nose to spite its face. It will be studied through the ages as a classic example of how to destroy a network effect.

It makes sense only if you have your nose down in the code and can't see anything else. Users are all robots, fatalistically following whatever trends you think you see.

There is no outside market, nor even a BTC price, so greater adoption couldn't possibly allow for greater decentralization through more people being interested in Bitcoin hence more people running full nodes. It's all about what Central Control determines by its code machinations.

Just because there are a lot of bullshit economists doesn't warrant a jump to the conclusion that economics is categorically worthless as a subject. In fact, it is arguably one of the most important subjects out there (if people understood money itself Bitcoin's value proposition would be a lot more obvious), and there is broad agreement about a great deal of the most important concepts. 
Let's taboo the word "economics" for a moment, because in the Bitcoin space what we really mean is the ability to design incentive structures that result in the desired outcomes. This is a skill that is often labeled as part of economic reasoning, but in any case it merely involves a certain way of thinking that typically doesn't come naturally. More to the point, the Core devs (aside from Satoshi) have not been in the business of incentive design, and anyway aren't highly evaluated for that skill set, but for things like their ability to optimize other aspects of the code. 
Maintainers are good at maintaining, but when maintenance is not necessarily what is required, there is no special reason to elevate their opinions above others who are very familiar with Bitcoin as an overall economic system.

I vehemently disagree :)
Hard forks should be sought out at any cost, *when necessary.* The hard forking mechanism is a wonderful gift, enabling the avoidance of all this "voice" politics (endless debate and gridlock) in favor of the "exit" dynamic where people put their money where their mouths are. Bitcoin, being both a platform and a commodity, is unprecedented in its ability to make these kinds of cleanly market-controlled decisions. We should learn to use this dynamic correctly, or else some other platform will.
If the concern is that contingents will be split off and Bitcoin thereby weakened or fractionated, note that avoiding a hard fork does not avoid that outcome. A hard fork with persistent split will happen if and only if a significant contingent deems the benefits of leaving to outweigh the (very considerable) network effect benefits of solidarity. Offering well-reasoned and tested lines along which to split, if a split is meant to be, can only be beneficial. The question is not "to fork or not to fork." The question is "how can we devise a fork that retains the greatest value by balancing utility with community solidarity."
But since forking is not a process to be feared but rather embraced, we can and therefore should make small, incremental forks to help allay the fears of each contingent. If the sky does not fall at 2MB, moving to 4MB will be much easier than even this modest change from 1 MB to 2 MB. If the sky does fall, it the damage will be minimized by not making a giant leap and us big-blockers will be a lot more willing to go along with alternative scaling mechanisms exclusively.

Yes, Bitcoin will grow to insane valuations in that scenario, finally reaching something like quadrillions of (devalued) dollars per coin, meaning something on the order of millions of today's dollars per coin.

If you can hard fork once safely, you can do it twice safely. In fact, the second one is likely to be substantially safer, because of the experience gained in the first. Hard forks will happen eventually anyway, so we might as well take control of the process. And if hard forks are indeed safe to do, we have a great new avenue available that sidesteps most of the debate: we can make a series of small exploratory forks like this one (BIP 102). We avoid giving anyone a heart attack, learn about what actually happens at bigger blocksize limits, and stop dealing with airy hypotheticals. It changes the whole nature of the debate.

It is circular to say a higher cap means a change in security properties. It seems to me people want absolute consistency on the economic factors, and they want Bitcoin to be as difficult to attack as possible. How it manages to achieve that is not something I would see as subject to any kind of social contract. If you would go that far, even a soft fork is unacceptable. 
More simply, if a bigger cap turns out to be the better choice for security and resilience (which I think it is, because popularity makes it harder to destroy for I think fairly obvious reasons, although there are new risks as well), how can it harm credibility? Sure, if bigger blocks ultimately on balance of all factors ends up weakening security, credibility will be damaged. But the same can be said of small caps. Therefore this credibility issue just boils down to the original question of whether raising the cap is actually more risky or less risky, in the broad sense.

In other words, devs gonna dev. Perhaps eventually just maintaining the codebase and making optimizations gets old. There are more exciting things that may provide larger leaps in efficiency and optimality over just simply raising the blocksize cap, so in terms of career it is more exciting to steer things in that direction, and this can be justified practically by the fact that these alternatives would in theory be better if they could be made to work, and made to work in time. The trouble is that that's a big "if." Perhaps the problem isn't even as much the financial motivation, but the personal motivation of restless coding geniuses like Greg and Adam - though that's too speculative to assume.

Someone will be wasting a lot of money (actually donating to miners) to force fees very slightly higher, temporarily. Then again, someone could go buy up all the salmon at the fish market tomorrow morning and force salmon prices up temporarily. Same with anything really, and almost never a problem.

Coins in one fork will be sold in coins for the other, on exchanges. This will look obvious in hindsight once it happens. The market is the mechanism by which changes are decided in Bitcoin (or it will be once we rid ourselves of the implementation monoculture), not to be confused with the consensus mechanism of longest chain, which is about transaction validity, not protocol changes. There has been a lot of conflation of these two very different things in this debate by calling them both "consensus." What a slippery word.

Whether a major movement relevant to Bitcoin should be supported or thwarted, both sides should agree that it must be discussed or else people will not be properly equipped to support/thwart it.

Good point that running with "full blocks" because of a fixed limit takes away the ability of miners to do the dynamic adjusting of blocksize to accommodate extra transaction load. The limit, if we are to have one, should always be well above normal transaction volume so that surges can be handled smoothly. More like a sanity check.
@_date: 2015-08-30 02:28:46
The whole point is that blocksize shouldn't be part of the consensus rules. It should be part of the transport layer. The consensus rules only need to cover what constitutes a valid transaction. The blocksize limit pushed a transport layer consideration into the consensus layer, creating a mess. It should be removed from the consensus layer. Nodes can just be allowed to set their own blocksize caps. If they set them too low, they'll be sitting out participation until they raise them, meanwhile exerting orphaning pressure. Longest chain rule still holds, valid transactions are still valid and invalid transactions are still invalid. All monetary properties are preserved.

Since the main use of Bitcoin at this time (investment) is not transaction-heavy, it won't matter.

Of course, if that happens, that limit will be whisked away in short fucking order. Any stalwarts will be overwhelmed by the wrath of investors, even if it means a split.

OK, you're going to get 20 people calling an idiot for this. I will say I can see how you can make the error. The root cause is in thinking in terms of BTC. BTC is just a term of convenience, because the alternative - what 1 BTC actually is - is unwieldy to talk about.
"1 BTC" just means a certain percentage (about 0.000007% as of now, or one 14-millionth) of the total ledger. That is, a "bitcoin" is just a shorthand for that percentage of the total ledger, or for 1/21M of the final total ledger. 
If, for example, the entire global economy ran on Bitcoin, if you owned 1000 BTC it would be roughly like having command of 0.007% of all the goods and labor resources available in the economy.
So now let's return to your question, but instead of phrasing it like, "What makes 1000 BTC more valuable than 100 BTC," let's phrase it in the more direct and elucidating way: **What makes having command over 0.007% of the economy more valuable than having command over 0.0007% of the economy?**
Phrased that way, the question answers itself.

It's an illusion that the protocol is keeping everything the same. It's rather the consistency of the will of all the Bitcoin stakeholders that accounts for the consistency you have seen up to now. 
Hard forks will need to happen, but people will never go for something that makes a change to the basic properties of the system as far as its money function. They should be minimized only because of risk of disruption, not because "somehow a wild fork will be snuck in" and "Bitcoin will change." It will not change in its money function, at least not unless the only choice is to die (possible future mining reward situation).
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:15:27
If we imagine that scenario came to pass, people would look back on that and say we learned that an alternative option outside Core (a fork of the code, and popular support shown for that fork) is an effective way for bitcoiners to incentivize the Core committers to listen to their demands. That would be the exit dynamic strengthening voice in the Voice vs. Exit paradigm. The Core devs maintain Core as the most popular implementation, but they learn the limits of their power. Alternatively, if they fail to learn this, they lose far more power as another implementation takes over that role.

As I think I said elsewhere, those considerations only reduce the precision of dynamic fees, resulting in a degree of waste because people will tend to overpay slightly to be sure their transaction will clear in time. The concept fundamentally works. 
Vendors actually change their prices a lot if they can avoid people getting upset about "price gouging." Miners can definitely do so, because it's such an impersonal service and because any vendor is as good as any other and there is no brand loyalty or whatever.

Collusion isn't a problem because there is too much temptation to break collusion agreements and take all the juicy fees at a slightly lower price, which spirals downward toward marginal cost of inclusion.

I assumed OP was talking about the next surge in adoption, which looks like it might be happening about now. It happens with huge, order of magnitude jumps, so even being anywhere remotely close to max capacity is bad. To be fair, we aren't actually as close to max capacity as it looks, since fees are not being assessed rationally yet; but we want the next bubble to be as smooth as possible so we better have rational fee allocation *and* bigger blocks.

Looking carefully at the 30 day chart is helpful here. Look at how each peak is followed by a dips going roughly halfway back to the floor, then higher. The final peak was overextended, and now it's just dipped about halfway back. Typical price discovery in a Fibonacci retracement pattern. The market is just testing around. If it runs too far, it has to retest some of that area it left behind. If a Grexit had happened, people would say the price sold off because the EU made a healthy decision and rejected moral hazard. It's all excuses to try to justify short term noise.
These kind of movements are the bull bucking and throwing off most traders. Since cypherdoc is on vacation today I'll say it for him, that despite world-beating exponential growth in the price over the years, "Most people will lose money in Bitcoin."

People will never agree on most such decisions, just like a lot of people don't agree on everything about Bitcoin as it is. Some think deflation is bad, for example. They go with the popular fork, though, because that is where the value it. 
The reason people are arguing so vigorously is that they know it is in their interest to convert as many people as possible to their way of thinking in order for their solution to have the greatest chance of being the solution that turns out to be popular (more precisely, the fork that attracts the most investment). If they lose, they will say oh well and go with the popular fork, because to stay with the unpopular fork will be to lose almost all of one's purchasing power. They are not arguing just to show that they will "stick it out on a minority fork with paltry market cap if necessary," though some feel posturing as if they will makes their argument more convincing.

Interesting point. Since mining is directly affectable by investing money, allowing miners to vote is really allowing investors to vote with their money. 
However, and this is a big however, if that ideal economic voting system is in place, the threshold for change should be 51%, not 90%. There is no reason to have a higher threshold if the system is economically ideal. The whole reason for choosing 90% (or 75%) ought to have been that this is kind of a wonky system that gives miners a lot of power and may be able to be gamed in some way. If not, there is no reason to require a super-majority. 
After all, it's just a less risky version of the on-exchange fork arbitrage process where people would trade coins on one fork for coins on another to determine which survives. That way requires a mere majority of investment money to determine the outcome.

How about doing it like a gold standard, where you have the BTC address printed on the bill, and if you go in to redeem the bill for BTC, they will actually remove it from that specific address.* This will help prove they have the reserves. If we increase the blocksize limit I guess you could have a separate address for every bill issued(?), that way they'd really have no way to do fractional reserves, since when you brought in a bill to be redeemed, if they didn't take the coins out of that specific address you'd know something was up. And anyone can check their address online, or probably an app will just scan a QR code on the note and tell you the balance so you can be sure it is backed. Since anyone could try to redeem any note at any time, even a tiny bit of fractional reserve cheating would be statistically quite dangerous.
For bank accounts, they could be required tell you the specific set of serial numbers (BTC addresses) your account balance is backed by.
*Address re-use would make this easiest, though I suspect some will say that is a bad thing.

Live price fees are for professional day traders and the otherwise insane. It's almost a guaranteed way to ensure you panic buy/sell at all the wrong times.

They don't understand money at all. 
Money is just a ledger system, whether that ledger is maintained by passing around pieces of valuable metal or printed paper promises, or by a cryptographically secure global network of computers. The money function is sustained solely by the ledger being unimpeachable in either case; the units of account don't need to be non-monetarily ("inherently") valuable. That just helps people gravitate on the convention of using them as money. It's not necessary at all for the memory function that is what constitutes money. See [Rai stones]( for another example.

That's how a market works. My bidding a higher price to secure a concert ticket pushes out the lowest bidder that otherwise would have got a ticket. *Lowest* is the operative word. People have different profiles of priority vs. wealth. Not every transaction is of equal urgency; it's a spectrum. 
A fee market works best when the blocksize is capped much higher than normal volume (or not capped at all) and miners actually have to make profit and loss calculations to determine blocksize and fee schedules dynamically. During surges they will adjust by *both* raising fees (asks) and making bigger blocks.

Who is saying a burn automatically sets the value? It's merely one group of people's valuation of the asset. Whether other people agree is up in the air. And of course, the burners believe they are paying less than what someone else will pay. 
It's as if you looked at Bitcoin mining and said, "This is the Marxist labor theory of value! Mining being expensive doesn't make Bitcoin have a value." Well of course. Scarcity is only one half of the picture. You need other people to want the asset in order in order for it to obtain a market price.

Most of the small blockers seem to confuse Bitcoin the code with Bitcoin the economic system. Sure, from a strictly code-wise view, retaining the 1MB limit is conservative and lifting it is a big change. But from a Bitcoin-the-economic-system perspective, the 1MB limit is a ticking time bomb, meaning that lifting it in order to retain the usual economic situation of "limit much higher than usage, limit not really limiting anything" is conservative and leaving it in is a big change. 
Now one can disagree that the 1MB has been having an effect all this time, say because it avoids some spam attacks. However, in terms of a fee market the argument (Jeff's argument) hits the mark undeniably. I have been advocating for both a fee market and higher limit, but the stalwarts are arguing in particular for a fee market to develop at 1MB, then the limit to be raised later, then another fee market to develop at the new limit, etc. The basic idea is at least a plausibly sound one: optimization should happen when the limit is still small, so that it will be lean optimization. It's a good heuristic. The flipside, as Jeff points out, is that this amounts to repeated changing of economic policy.
The fee market is needed to achieve maximum capacity and ensure rational allocation of scarce resources. However, it may be best to forego the heuristic notion of lean optimization and only have that fee market come into effect when we reach the real maximum potential blocksize limit. That means a situation where adoption is booming and there is a broad consensus that additional increases to the limit would be too risky at that time. (Whether the limit remains hardcoded or is set by miners and nodes as a result of removing the hardcoded cap.) 
The refrain of "free shit army" (the idea that people who are for upping the limit are just looking for a free lunch and are blissfully ignorant of the scaling difficulties of the blockchain) is then no better than the claim of the other side that the stalwarts want to retain "1MB forever." Both realize there are tradeoffs, and both generally realize eventually we need both bigger blocks and a fee market. It's just a matter of which we allow to happen first, and Jeff's  arguments here make it seem unnecessarily disruptive to allow the fee market to develop first (and undevelop, and redevelop, over and over again).

Yup, despite the top replies in this thread so far by upvotes, for most people in stable, advanced countries who don't want to use the black market for anything, right now Bitcoin is only useful as an investment.
That's just another way of saying that the things it could eventually be useful for are very compelling. Investment involves people identifying Bitcoin's future uses and judging their viability, thereby increasing the price in the present to account for the odds of that future success. Since a lot of people dismiss Bitcoin (especially those who don't understand it), the price is much lower than it arguably could be, or will be, once people start to get it.
If you're looking for a high-risk, high-return investment that you can carry in your brain anywhere in the world, and if you have some talent or interest in finance, technology, and economics, Bitcoin is worth a look.

That wouldn't double your stash because it's a zero sum game.

Marxism?? Who? There are some socialists/statists here, and I think the reason they can like Bitcoin is often that they think it's some kind of lower-fee Paypal. Basically just a better mousetrap as far as online currency. Such people may see the deflationary and investment aspects as "necessary evils." Or maybe they see the other applications are more important than money (plenty of socialists in the Ethereum sub). Also, some people really haven't connected all the dots and are just compartmentalized. 
There have been many people whose understanding of Bitcoin prompted them to re-examine their economic and/or political views. Someone recently said there are more Austrian Economists (or at least AE fans) on Bitcoin forums than on all the AE and libertarian forums combined.

No one can know the real reason, of course, but it should not have come as any kind of surprise. Just look at the [1-month chart]( The price was rising in a series of steady peaks followed by ~50% retracements, then it surged upward way faster, and then retraced about 50% again, but this time the retracement was bigger (in terms of absolute value, not percentages) because the increase was bigger. 
Markets don't move in straight lines. This is the most important concept to internalize. The faster it rises on the daily chart, the faster it will fall - even if it continues rising dramatically *on average* over several weeks. Study the historical logarithmic charts when the price rose 100x in a year, in [2013]( There were tons of crazy thrills and scary spills on the way up, as that's how the market moves. 
Try not to look at the daily chart unless you're right about to make an important trade, like once every few months. The weekly, monthly, and yearly charts are what you should spend the most time examining if you want to make money. Bitcoin goes haywire on the daily chart all the time, usually meaninglessly.

Well the point of the blockchain is to reach that consensus, and that's we can't in general rely on "common sense" or whatever. Isn't the argument you want to make rather something like, "If a miner generates a block that is so big it only propagates to 49% of the network (in terms of hashpower), then it's not an attack on those less well-connected miners but rather a bet they're likely to lose as other miners send out blocks that reach more of the network and build out a longer chain on them"?
That seems to place the "economic blocksize limit" near whatever blocksize would download too slowly for 50% of the network by hashing power. (The fairy tale seems to go that miners could freeze out half the network, then raise the blocksize and freeze out half the remaining network, etc. Seems this doesn't work because the more poorly connected class of miners would have much more hashing power as a group, making the big block makers irrelevant.)

They were right, the price went down and now they can get a 5 times better deal on bitcoins. Meanwhile startups are looking overheated as you say.

Your thesis is way, way too broad and also not concrete enough. Assuming a 5- to 7-page essay, you just want to focus on one single point that many people would disagree with, then marshal arguments to change their minds. Essays are fundamentally argumentative pieces. The thesis has to be controversial, and since it's hard to change people's minds the thesis has to be very narrow and very specific. If you choose an fluffy/abstract thesis you're end up with a fluffy essay that accomplishes nothing. If the thesis is too ambitious, it will be impossible to change the audience's mind in the space allotted.
Try something more like, "Bitcoin can greatly contribute to ending global poverty." Any single point with that level of scope where multiple arguments can be brought up.
A very standard and easy to write format for an essay is this: Start the first paragraph with general statements, working down toward the thesis with more and more narrow statements until the final sentence of the first paragraph, which is the thesis. It must be clear and simple, and controversial.
In each paragraph after that, bring one argument per paragraph, totaling 3-5 paragraphs and saving the big guns for the last of those paragraphs. (Examples of arguments for the poverty thesis: Bitcoin can help with sending money home from developed to developing countries, Bitcoin can help merchants in impoverished nations not served by banks and credit card companies/Paypal sell their products, Bitcoin can save citizens of corrupt governments from inflation like in Zimbabwe by being a gold-like store of value that cannot be stolen if handled right and that can be fled with when escaping from the country without being noticed).
Then in the next paragraph (the final one in the essay) restate the narrow thesis in slightly different words, now much more credible to the audience, and spend the rest of that paragraph driving home broader and broader implications that follow from the thesis you have convinced people of.

Exchanges make far far less money if BTC is single digits, no way the VCs are getting a return on their investment that way. Payment processors process way less because few people would be using Bitcoin (else it wouldn't be single digits). Same with remittances. Same with wallet sites, storage sites, hardware makers, hardware wallet makers...people will not pay for wallets, storage, hardware, or hardware wallets unless they are securing substantial amounts of money.


The VC model is "bet on 10 companies, lose on 9." Now maybe VCs don't buy commodities usually, but in Bitcoin's case there is a reason: [owning BTC is like owning an ETF on the whole Bitcoin space]( Chamath Palihapitiya, for one, owns BTC in his funds.

Not just a wholly new system, a wholly new ledger. 
The basic problem with the altcoin crowd is they look at Bitcoin's limitedness and how much money they would have been able to make if they got in early compared to now, and they decide they want to have it all and go out on their own. This is wishful thinking. They think that just because "it would be nice" to do that, they should just go do it. 
The world doesn't run on sunshine and lollipops. There are hard realities you have to face, and only being able to become a billionaire instead of a trillionaire for building something major and innovative, because you started in 2014 instead of 2010, is one of those realities. And if you really find Bitcoin too limiting, you can still take advantage of Bitcoin's network effects by using Bitcoin's ledger for your coin distribution. Of course no one does that, because that takes away the possibility of being a trillionaire.

Rushing merchant adoption is dumb, but it's part of a larger delusion that "Bitcoin is *the currency of the Internet*," right there in the sidebar. No, Bitcoin hopefully *will be* the currency of the Internet, but it sure as hell isn't yet. Right now it's a way of moving and holding money that is extremely useful for certain niche applications, as well as an investment that will grow mightily if those applications expand.
The misconception that Bitcoin is already mainly a payment system rather than mainly a way to store value out of prying hands, and an investment in future applications including it becoming a payment system, is the greatest misconception in Bitcoin today. 
Millions of dollars and countless hours are being spent pursuing inefficient adoption angles based on this premature notion. Investors and supporters are continually confused by this. And clearly many people are pissed off by the knock-on effects. On Bitcointalk this is relatively well understood, but on Reddit hivemind it isn't. 
However, I must say that this is just Reddit, and if you'll going to be put off of a technology by someone community behavior, that's almost as silly as what you're railing against.

Austrians are wrong about one important thing: gold is NOT a medium of indirect exchange in the sense of people simply accepting it "because there's always someone who they could fob it off on because some people value it for its decorative uses." The decorative use represents only a tiny portion of gold's value. Gold is primarily valuable because of the convention to use gold as money. If it lost that status in society and reverted to its decorative value so that its only use for most people would be to sell it to a jeweler, the guy that accepted your gold in payment got a horribly raw deal. He only accepted an ounce of gold for a fine tailored suit because of he social convention. If not for that convention he might have asked for 20 ounces.
Gold isn't a medium of indirect exchange; gold is a token in the Gold ledger system that exists in society by convention. When you understand this, Bitcoin's value becomes starkly obvious.

Uber is basically a reputation and identity system. To make a decentralized version of Uber, AirBnB, Yelp, eBay and markets for everything including journalism, what we need is a reputation and identity system.

I can sort of see why this is a bit contentious: the presumption of guilt/innocence came in alternating waves. When the news was breaking a lot of people were careful to insert "alleged" and such, but after a while of debating it over multiple threads eventually many people got convinced of one theory or the other and/or got lazy and dropped the "alleged" out of habit or out of actual presumption of guilt. At some points later the "alleged" would be re-emphasized off and on, then forgotten again. That's how it always goes, isn't it?

Indeed. There could be a temporary dip as Kraken sells/auctions off the coins, then a surge as they buy back to send BTC to creditors. Or if they keep it in BTC I'm guessing most people will hold, since they were thinking it was a good investment at 4x the price, so it must be an even better investment to them now. But you never know what people will do. Opportunities abound if you are in Japan.

I sometimes deliberately use the term "hoarding" when defending the act of saving money, in an effort to neutralize the misuse of the term by the Keynesians by showing that hoarding goods and hording *claims on goods* (i.e., money) are pretty much opposite actions. It betrays a great amount of economic ignorance to use them interchangeably.

Once you understand that money is just a ledger, the idea of printing and shuttling around stacks of paper and coins in a low-tech effort to keep track of the ledger, let alone constructing giant expensive buildings in every town to engender trust, seems amazingly wasteful and environmentally damaging. Even under a purely digital system the trust needed to make it work ends up costing a fortune at all scales, which ultimately means more environmental destruction.
It's understandable that people look to an alternative to "wasting" energy, but they don't understand that the energy "wasted" *is itself* the verification of consensus truth. All efforts to avoid proof of work in decentralized ledgers, insofar as they end up being effective, will just end up being roundabout ways of proving work (i.e., expending energy).

Coins "sitting around in wallets" *are* an investment (in the rest of the economy) and *do* provide a return to the owner (if and only if the economy grows). Holding coins in a wallet is like holding shares in an index fund covering the entire economy. 
Not only does 10% economic growth give holders a 10% return, but investing in specific companies instead of holding just diverts some of the available resources away from the companies you didn't invest in, to the companies you did invest in. The act of investing doesn't magically create more resources by itself, it just changes who commands more of the available resources and who commands less. If you have talent at selecting good companies, you should do so and you will make money, but if you don't there is no reason to think your choice of which companies shall be able to command more resources will be a net benefit to the economy, nor that you will get a return instead of a loss.
The total amount of money doesn't matter at all, because money is just a ledger. A dollar, a bitcoin, or an ounce of gold simply represent a certain percentage of the total money supply in the Dollar, Bitcoin, and Gold ledgers, respectively. Magically destroying half the dollars in everyone's bank accounts and pockets, half the BTC in every address, and half the gold held everywhere, would not result in any kind of liquidity issue. People would just halve all the prices once they realized what had happened, and that would be the end of it, since no one's *percentage* of the total money supply ever changed.

It's not about stability. It's about having control over your money.

Yes, and keep in mind that a year ago they were burning far more and the price only slowly wafted downward over many months. There are a ton of people on the sidelines waiting for a bottom to buy.

I've never seen so much hemming, hawing, philosophizing, and theorizing about "what could possibly be the cause" of a relatively tiny price movement that is well within the historical norm for BTC. 
If only there were a historical chart showing percentage movements so we could compare the current action to see if it's ever been this bad? Oh wait, [there is]( Not only has it been worse in the past, it's been *much* worse. 
And regarding this current dip itself, not only is a 30% move over a few weeks not anything major given the historical norm, it's not even anything *minor*. This is the norm. Stability like we've had for the past few months is the outlier, but somehow - like clockwork - people have an incredibly short memory and get hypersensitized to price movements whenever we have a bit of stability, and we have to have this conversation all over again.

There are two types of Bitcoin-enabled remittance. 
One we might call the early-stage rebittance: send fiat-to-fiat via Bitcoin through a third party. That may or may not prove to have compelling advantages over other services (though in unbanked countries I think the advantages are more clear cut).
The other we might call late-stage remittance, or by that time simply "sending money," where everyone is already using Bitcoin and there is no need for any conversions. That use case is unquestionably very compelling and extremely cheap, but it requires Bitcoin to be ubiquitous. 
The question is really if early-stage rebittances make sense, or where they make sense.

It's more an issue of perception, based on what other people do. With bank accounts, torture has been tried and tends to fail because the operation gets too elaborate. If torture initially works with Bitcoin, it may become temporarily popular among thieves, but just as quickly you can bet every Bitcoin user will start using storage methods not amenable to torture. Then word will get around that it's not generally worth the risk, just like torturing people with big bank balances.
Eventually personal drone security will do away with this kind of problem altogether, and sure thieves can play too but you won't generally want to mess with nerds (which Bitcoin early adopters will be thought of as) in such a technological future.

ITT we basically have two Buttcoin themes going on here that are mutually contradictory.

They are based on the contradictory premises that "Bitcoin is mainly the currency of the Internet" and "Bitcoin is mainly an investment based on the possibility that it will *become* the currency of the Internet."
If Bitcoin is mainly, today, useful as an investment, then hoarding *is* using. And harassing merchants to accept it is a mistake.

You can't know automatically, but the bottom line is that this sub does double as a Bitcoin fan sub, and many do not feel the obligation to address arguments over and over that have been discussed so many times.

I think it will go up in value, because people will want to use it for things like offshoring wealth, black markets, grey markets, remittances, and eventually e-commerce. As more and more people use it, its usefulness will increase. Later on it will be incorporated into prediction markets enabling decentralized stock markets and many other things. All this is possible only because Bitcoin has all the monetary properties of gold without the fixed physical location problem. It's a fundamental shift in the physics of value storage and transfer, and its implications are only just starting to be felt. Once people realize what is happening, everyone will scramble to get themselves onto the universal ledger of civilization that is now called the Bitcoin ledger. Those who realize this early can buy land on that ledger for very cheap still, especially during this price dip.

Manipulating actual free markets is harder. Or, you can do it, but you have to make the market a lot bigger in the process. Just think if you and I were the only two holders of an asset that we both believe will be many orders of magnitude higher in 5-10 years.

The investment phase we're in now will last until Bitcoin is either dead or well over $100,000 per coin. After that, it will be mostly be like gold and silver used to be in say 1800s USA: the money everyone used. You could ask all sorts of complicated questions about how economics would work at that stage, or you could just note that the USA in the 1800s experienced the greatest increase in standard of living in the history of the world, and conclude that things should be OK.

The above three comments make me think you don't appreciate the difference between centralization of power and merely things like consensus of a protocol or having a large-ish company that will look out for your interests.
The Internet continues to abolish the centralization of media power and the power of indoctrination (i.e., education), and is on its way to abolishing the power of superstitions like organized religion and arbitrary territorial nationalism. Bitcoin is abolishing the centralization of monetary power and financial markets. Things like OpenBazaar and its offshoots will eat up the judicial system and eventually all the rest. Government will not disappear for quite a while, if it ever does, but large central governments will continually devolve to smaller and smaller territorial units until their services actually start to make some market sense. (And if/where they never make market sense, they will dissolve completely.)
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:10:02
The cryptoledger space operates by consensus of the *economic* majority, which is as close as you can get to "voting by people who have the most stake in the outcome and who are continually vetted by a market process where the voters best at choosing the protocol that adds the most value gain more and more influence, and those who are worst at it lose their influence." 
This process would be even smoother if exchanges were set up with the ability to buy and sell coins in different forks in the event of a hard fork, because then the voters would completely include even solely Bitcoin investors, not just miners and altcoin arbitrageurs.
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:06:01

We will almost certainly see "altcoin-type tech" that does provide some utility that Bitcoin doesn't, but it's highly unlikely that it will do the most crucial thing that Bitcoin does: unimpeachable money with uncensorable transactions uncontrollable by governments and the establishment bankers.

Any tiny currency is universally accepted within some economic community if you delineate the economic community right.

Its progress will be one of ever lighter shades of market infiltration.

They won't, or at least not very many of them. 
Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency; there are no cryptocurrencies yet. Bitcoin is a cryptoledger that may one day have enough global adoption to be called a currency. Right now Bitcoin is an investment asset whose upside is based largely on the possibility of it becoming the world's currency, in part or in full. The altcoins are just alternative bets on generally the same upside target (though some are more limited in scope). 
The reason there is a bunch of cryptoledgers coexisting right now is that many people haven't figured out which one will take over and become the global ledger of civilization. Sure, there could be a use for a few sub-ledgers for niche purposes, but not more than a few (however, *centralized* private ledgers will be myriad). 
As a Bitcoin "maximalist" (another stupid term coined by people that don't get it), I would say that the altcoins each represent a different flavor of how to misunderstand Bitcoin.

I've always seen Bitpay and the merchants they sign on as mostly a release valve for the steam produced during bubbles. As the price rises and people inevitably want to convert bitcoin to fiat in order to rebalance their portfolio (take profits on the investment gains), since exchanges are still difficult and people are feeling rich, they can skip several steps by buying whatever they need through Bitcoin-enabled merchants. That enables a partial skipping of dealing with exchanges.
Since Bitcoin has risen a lot since its inception and will need to rise a lot more in order to be successful, and since exchanges are likely to continue to be a friction point for quite some time, Bitpay seems a moderately viable play on Bitcoin's value. Though since it doesn't seem to be a very leveraged play I'm not sure there's that much point to it as venture investment.
In short, I think Bitpay's main competitors are the exchanges. They're a minor help in reducing friction in that way, but I think they are part and parcel of the very premature push for merchant adoption and "Bitcoin is a currency!" idea, which is also jumping the gun. Bitcoin, being a tool for getting around things, will first be useful where there are things to be got around. The bigger and more formidable the obstacles to commerce in a given area, the more Bitcoin can be useful. Bitcoin adoption will continue to happen organically at the margins, driven by pressing need, not minor convenience. Meanwhile, investment drives up the price, though in humongous fits and starts ( spectacular rises and drops on a net upward path, if it is to succeed), to make future ubiquity more and more likely. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:42:50
Anyone can do what they want, and that's fine, but pushing merchants who have no compelling reason to adopt yet is just going to backfire. It also leads to harmful misconceptions like that "the block reward is paying for the transactions," when it's mainly paying for the secure value storage.

Thanks for the useful answer. Speaking as one who has highly non-mainstream views on many things, I agree the group dynamics are always interesting to watch even when I'm part of them. In any group, whether it has mainstream views or not, there are never many people who got to their position by critical thinking, but rather they heard arguments/propaganda somewhere and were amenable to them for whatever reason. So there will always be a lot of groupthink. 
With the Internet we are leaving the age of propaganda, where convincing people of a view was mostly about bombarding them with your side of the story and not so much about covering the objections that could be raised, or at least not covering them with complete charity. Now with these kinds of lightly moderated open-participation forums becoming commonplace, propaganda doesn't work as well because there is often someone there to tell the other side of the story. More and more one has to present both views and show why one is preferred. 
Groupthink is under constant assault in such forums, and that is part of what we are seeing here. It helps keep arguments honest and balanced, anticipating objections, being as clear as possible. Now many bitcoin people will jump to say that often the buttcoin people even refuse to listen to reasoned arguments. Of course, because there is groupthink in both directions, in all factions. 
When meeting people of different views, then, I think the most fruitful thing to do is attempt to present arguments with maximum clarity and patience, always looking for holes where someone could object and filling them in so as to make things easier for everyone. Because if there is any hole someone will stick their finger in it. This place is a pretty good dojo, except for the fact that ongoing debates are difficult on reddit. (For that, there's Bitcointalk.) Reddit lends itself to sniping, which doesn't go very deep.

Of course it's a reasonable investment idea if Bitcoin is to succeed. People still haven't internalized the most basic point about markets: *they don't move in straight lines.* 
What goes up too fast, will go down a lot and/or for a long time *even within the context of a larger overall bull trend.* 
The price fell 94% in 2011, and didn't get anywhere near its previous peak for almost two years. There were sob stories galore, but every single one of those people who bought at the very peak and wrote a sob story online is now up at least 700%, and most more like 1000% or more, if they are still holding (which, of course, most aren't, because they were just price chasers with no real conviction about the long-term investment proposition).

If it doesn't skyrocket again, it's never going to succeed. There's simply no way to get from current prices to mainstream adoption prices within a reasonable timeframe without large percentage gains each year on average. And large steady gains inevitably mean skyrocketing and plummeting, because of market psychology.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:23:40
Of course it can be raised. Minimum fees or blocksize limits are functionally very similar to raising the 21M coin limit: in either case the percentage of coin held by miners increases and that held by users decreases. 21M is arbitrary. It could be 42M if we doubled the balance in every address simultaneously. It wouldn't change anything economically. 
However, it's unlikely to be raised by changing the block reward schedule any time in the next few decades, simply because people would sell the coins in any fork that tried that, because it's an unpopular initiative. If it ever did become absolutely needed, like because miners weren't getting paid enough and increasing fees or lowering max blocksize wasn't an option, then it would stop being so unpopular. Nothing to worry about in either case.

The amount of investment money that's going to finance dead-end tech in this space will be unprecedented. There's a big learning curve to truly understand Bitcoin and related technology/economics, and there are plenty of misconceptions floating around. This one is a prime example, but it also functions as a sort of trojan horse because by the time these companies have spent a year or two trying to pointlessly de-bitcoinize Bitcoin, they'll have had time to really appreciate the value proposition. The slower ones more entrenched in the old paradigm will learn the hard way.

Tabooing the illegal uses for Bitcoin backfires. People start wondering how marginal accretion can happen when there are no solid seeds. Lured in with talk of remittances, cheaper shopping, and 2.0 whirligigs, they gradually find that none of these are ready yet. The black market has been the solid seed. True need feeds the greed. 
At higher valuations, more and more compelling uses will open up, but for now there is a firm backstop to Bitcoin's valuation. The binary bet of "zero or moon" has been slightly upgraded to "likely double-digits or moon," with a commensurate increase in market price.

Easier ways to acquire is far more important.

The price fell to the low hundreds *after rising from the low teens a little over 2 years ago*, and the low single digits two years before that.

Is this basically a service that verifies existing oracles and puts their data streams into Bitcoin/Counterparty-usable form? Because that could be a very useful service in the meantime, before it becomes standard practice for oracles to publish cryptographic feeds.
For example, the National Weather Service might release a stream of weather data. With Counterparty's contracts-for-difference you may be able to make bets (or take out an insurance policy) on weather conditions in your area, but only if the NWS published their stream data cryptographically.

There were compelling reasons then, and there are many more compelling reasons now. That's what much of this sub discusses daily. The way to argue against the investment proposition of Bitcoin is to address those reasons when they are brought up, not to point to price noise that is well within the historical norm for the asset and say the sky is falling (nor "to the moon" for that matter - get used to volatility in both directions).

"Month Day, Year" makes sense because in the majority of situations the order that allows for fastest and most useful apprehension of the general time something happened is month first then the day second and the year last. Since most things are dated within the past year, of course the year is last. But the day is usually too fine a level of precision to get it first. You want month and then day in most situations, and the traditional usage reflects this basic reality of the contours of human affairs that don't always align with clean mathematical progressions.
I gather the reason Europe uses Day/Month/Year and the gag-inducing "5th December, 2015" style is some central planner's wet dream of feigned scientism and schoolmaster sticklerish order that "will make everything soooo much more efficient," just like central planners always want to take something that developed over centuries of trial and error and replace it with their theoretically better system. Socialism, socialism, everywhere!
Or maybe times have changed and the standardization was actually needed because of computer systems :)

Better response: collusion deals just create a bigger prize for breaking the collusion. "We charge no lower than $80! Agreed!"

No legs, wasted VC money... yes, true in the sense of merchant adoption being premature. Many mistakenly see Bitcoin as Shopper's Paradise already, and there are startups trying to make that happen soon, but both are premature. Both "now" and "soon" are too early. This leads to a lot of wasted money and disappointment, even disillusionment if the people thinking this way fail to see their error.
While there are some great niches for Bitcoin already, those niches exist for specific reasons that do not apply to general retail. Shopping for the general consumer of general goods will be one of the very last apps for Bitcoin. Right now it's very early days, so still the main way to play in the space is as an investor. Investing is simply the act of recognizing that if everyone already used Bitcoin it would be a superior system, but that there's a chicken-and-egg problem in getting there, and you stand to make money by recognizing that, and wonderfully your investment money simultaneously helps resolve that. If you want to do something with merchant adoption, look at niches where Bitcoin is helpful or even indispensable.

Intermediary generally implies significant cut taken, some other person or group has some control over your money, and it can be regulated. For Bitcoin none of this is the case. 
You could perhaps say that the Bitcoin miners, etc. are a group that has control over your money, but the whole idea of Bitcoin is that it is not a group that is credibly *going* to exercise such control, because of the incentive structure. If we assume otherwise, we are then already assuming that Bitcoin is broken, and if we are assuming such a thing there is no need to talk about intermediaries in the first place.

No no, for the *near* term it will be in the transport layer. Later, as it becomes ever more mainstream, more and more end users will use it, directly or indirectly, to store their wealth (and those that really value privacy and non-confiscability are already doing so). All the while, investors will be pouring money into the Bitcoin space in anticipation of these future developments, and a lot of that goes - in waves - into buying bitcoins directly.

He says, "Forget Bitcoin, it's about the blockchain." Given yesterday's Align announcement and strategy, I think this is actually just a crypto-embrace (no pun intended) of Bitcoin. They're saying, "Forget that Bitcoin is money and that there are people invested in it, scams run with it, thefts and heists of the currency, etc. Forget Bitcoin with all its complexity, stigma, and user-unfriendliness. It's what the blockchain can do for your business that matters." 
Companies like IBM are taking that too seriously, thinking they can just make any old blockchain and use it. No, the operative word is "the." THE blockchain. Bitcoin's blockchain. The coin is what creates the incentive that enables it, but you - the consumer, the business, the regulator - don't need to know that. Only those actually building things in the space or investing in that infrastructure need to know that. Later, when Bitcoin is silently mainstream, its use as money will come to the fore.

The blocksize limit is effectively infinite right now, in the sense that it's not limiting anything. Blocksizes are being limited by other forces for now. It's only a limit that comes into play later, when tx volume is higher.

If it were an urgent issue, it would already have been raised.

Wences Casares was the one who made it first, to my knowledge.
However, even if it is wrong (gold is actually quite pretty compared to aluminum), the larger fact that a reversion of gold to its decorative value would bring it to some tiny fraction of its current price is enough to destroy Krugman's argument. 
Oddly enough, this is also the Austrian argument against Bitcoin. Both are wrong because they don't understand that money is memory (all money is ultimately just a ledger). 
Even more oddly, the head of the Minneapolis Fed does understand this, and did as far back as 1997 when he predicted that something like Bitcoin could - if invented - put the central banks' control of money in jeopardy.

Paper notes are government promises. If you can't get your government to redeem its promises when Bitcoin comes to town that's between you and the government you placed your trust in. Do you think the governments of European nations didn't redeem their francs, marks, etc. for euros when the euro was rolled out? If we're seriously talking about the last community to adopt Bitcoin, that means the government and everyone else is already on the Bitcoin standard. If the government doesn't redeem its fiat promises that is on the feds.

Investment has been coming, it's just been going into mining and startups instead of into buying bitcoins. The three move in cycles.
Here's [BTC price and mining difficulty (log scale)]( and here's [venture capital investment]( Notice how difficulty and VC rose during 2014 as the price was falling. A lot of money continues to flow into Bitcoin, but it was flowing to mining, which seems to have tapered off as the tech is getting advanced, and the money is still mostly flowing to VC. Once the startup space gets too crowded and bubbly, the money spigots - assuming they remain on, and I see no reason why not - will have no place to flow but into buying BTC again.

That's just a handout to arbitrageurs, or even anyone watching multiple markets. A dump on one exchange, even if it ripples somewhat over to other exchanges, just gives an easy arbitrage opportunity because the dump elsewhere will rarely be as deep.

It's either a short-term mistake but a long-term win, or a win in general. It could be a short-term mistake because Core is now headed by a guy who thinks consensus among their devs is required for all changes. But either way it is a long-term win because sooner or later - depending on how counterproductive the Core dev gridlock becomes - Core will be forked away from. 
Having no one central implementation is the biggest win of all. Perhaps Gavin sped up that process by abdicating his "throne," but in so doing, despite any short-term pain, he may have facilitated the highly beneficial and necessary process of eliminating thrones in Bitcoin altogether.

I don't really support general merchant adoption at this time, but the pervasive myth that merchant adoption drives the price down assumes Bitcoin is not mainly an investment asset, which is false on its face. People don't just blindly spend away something they want to be invested in and say, "Oops, looks like my 80% allocation to bitcoins is now 40%. Oh well." They would buy back unless they actually wanted to change their portfolio allocation in the first place, in which case they would have sold anyway if they had not spent, so it doesn't matter even in the worst case where the merchant immediately dumps the coins. 
The simplest and most obvious reason the BTC price went down is because it went up an enormous amount in a very short time. No special theories are needed.

One thing we know: BTC is a 5x better buy now than it was at the peak. And that's being conservative, because Bitcoin's prospects - if you clear away the optimism that was merely driven by the high price - have improved a lot since then, infrastructure is much better, VC investment has skyrocketed, and the network continues to chug along without any failures (it now has a 6.5-year track record instead a 5-year track record). 
If you bought at $1200 thinking there is a fair chance it will go up to $100,000 or $1 million eventually and you would make 100x or 1000x gains, that argument is now at least 5 times as compelling. Unless of course you thought it would go to the moon *merely because* the price was rising so fast. 
If Bitcoin does go "to the moon," we will look back at $1200 and say, "That was a great time to buy;  it's just that the following year was even better."

Even then the idea that spending happens in a vacuum has been thoroughly debunked. Insofar as Bitcoin is held as an investment, it is subject to portfolio targeting. People who want to hold half or 80% of their wealth in Bitcoin won't just spend all their coins away.

A universal language would make a lot of sense if not for how intertwined language is with culture and how hard it is to learn a different language. Switching to a single digital ledger instead of a physical one (paper, gold, or an eclectic mix of centralized computer ledgers owned by banks and governments) is a whole lot easier for each person once the infrastructure is in place.

No, why is policy always seen as one big *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy? 
The typical government move is simple: try to ride a wave of grassroots public sentiment that is already there, then forevermore take credit for creating the wave. Do we really think that racism is lower now because of the law change? If the law were abolished would we start seeing some businesses put up signs prohibiting certain races? Imagine if that were to happen, anywhere in the US. Instant business destruction, instant identification of who the racists are. That would be lethal in this day, purely because the culture has changed, not the laws. The idea that people are not adult enough and the culture is not mature enough to do this without government help is quite odd and paternalistic.

You mean deposit insurance? That's to guard against bank runs, which are only possible because of fractional reserve. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem in the first place. Maybe you mean the bank can get you your money even if you lose your password, so it's a kind of insurance against password loss. That one's true, but it can only ever be "solved" by trusting a third-party custodian.

Andreas is great on a lot of points, but he misses or partially misses some of the more important economic aspects. Also, his "there will be thousands of altcoins" thesis has issues, and I think that belies some of his economic misunderstanding. He is very very good, but not a complete source. Satoshi is of course wonderful. 
When I think of what isn't covered by those two, the multiyear megathread [Gold collapsing. Bitcoin UP.]( comes to mind. It keeps abreast of anything you'd miss from listening to Andreas only, and is followed by a lot of heavy hitters who chime in from time to time.

It's true that they could pivot to altcoins, perhaps, but many of these business models don't work without crypto. (It would be nice to make a list of which ones do and which ones don't.)
There are two alternative reasons I find more likely:
1) The price was overheated, people wanted to get in, but especially since a major point of the narrative was that price had exceeded the infrastructure build-out, the big players naturally turned to startups. Chamath Palihapitiya even said near the bubble peak that he wants to invest a lot more, but "not just yet" (I think he was implying the price was frothy). His tweets mentioned in another comment further support this thinking.
2) Startups are simply a lot more familiar as far as investments go, also easier to wrap your head around than Bitcoin itself. The perceived ability to pivot is probably a factor, but the weirdness and uncertainty of holding actual bitcoins is a hard point. The ETF should take a lot of the edge off that. 
EDIT: Another point is just the security issues with owning/holding bitcoins, especially when your firm doesn't have the structure in place to do so (m-of-n schemes, cold wallet protocol, etc.).

Money does beget money, but without a bribe-able central authority who can beat down your competition and leave loopholes just for you, you have to actually continue to provide value to people in order to keep living a wealthy lifestyle. 
Money begetting money on the market is in general a good thing: the best value creators are empowered to create even more value, the most prescient investors who invest in actually useful technologies and bid up the price of resources that actually would have experienced severe shortages had they not done so - these oracles helping society most efficiently direct and ration its resources - gain more and more power to influence resource usage (though one big mistake and they're out, with no government to bail them out). Meanwhile bad investors, bad entrepreneurs, and other people who waste society's resources by diverting them to less valued ends continually lose power to influence resource usage. 
As the market matures in an anarchic condition it continually improves and becomes more rational, harmonious, and generally flourishing, just like an ecosystem. For more on this, check out Hayek's writings on spontaneous order.

Well just like any other investing you have to make a bet and turn out to be right. If you're just asking where you can make bets, there are platforms for Bitcoin loans, stocks, altcoins, and many other investments. Almost all of them are money-losing of course, but there are opportunities sometimes. 
There is no magic way of turning money into *guaranteed* income, neither in Bitcoin nor in any other kind of money. Even in a bank account there are various small risks, commensurate with the small return.

You're mixing up absolute and relative measures. Sure, the BTC will be moving by more dollars per day, like it might go from $9000 to $9100 in a day, which would be a huge $100 change at today's prices, but as a percentage it is only about 1%, whereas today a move of 10% in a day isn't uncommon.

I would guess the larger problem is mathematical. How are you going to get significant sales out of a group that, at present, constitutes a tiny portion of the population? If you don't have a great reason why Bitcoin uniquely enables your business, it's probably not worth dealing with at this time unless you enjoy being an extremely early adopter. Examples of when merchant adoption makes sense:
1) Commerce is difficult or impossible without the benefits Bitcoin provides (black markets)
2) Anonymity is an issue (VPNs, porn, seedboxes, local regs)
3) Your country or customer base is largely unbanked or unserved by credit card companies and Paypal
4) You're a very large merchant so the economies of scale make it worthwhile, and even if they don't yet it's worth investing in training now to get your corporation ready for when Bitcoin is more ubiquitous (Overstock.com, NewEgg, Dell, Microsoft)
5) There's a concentration of local bitcoin-accepted businesses in your area, so that bitcoiners will go out of their way to visit (Berlin, Ghent, wherever else)
6) You want to have an image of being on the cutting edge of technology, or you're just interested in Bitcoin, especially if you won't be converting much to fiat
7) You're an online business that relies (or could rely) significantly on small payments or tips
8) You cater specifically to the Bitcoin community
9) You hope to make use of the programmable money aspects of Bitcoin

I see concern trolling (the type that gains traction) as just another signal that not enough people in the community understand something, so may as well have the discussion again, repetitive as it may be. If a concern, whether genuine or trolling, can get upvoted or elicit worry in some segment of the community, it's a sign we need more education, so I see the issue of trolling as pretty neutral. No one's upvoting blatant trolling, so the goal is to make anything that is so trivial and debunked as to be trolling *look* blatant enough that it gets ignored - through education.
If very few people pay heed to the concern/troll (or they downvote it), it's of no consequence, and if not then it's a good chance to correct a misconception.

*current reference implementation
Though I don't think the word "reference" adds anything to the rest of the description. It is simply the main implementation at this time. By including signatories, the letter passive-aggressively tries to imply that this state of affairs is something to be preserved going forward, and that if you are not with us, you are with those who would go rogue and destroy "Bitcoin." This cajoling is incredibly transparent, yet unlikely to be noticed by those who are easily suckered into social bandwagoning.

Rather than "alternative implementation," since people have some issues with that wording, how about "alternative protocol for maintaining the Bitcoin ledger" (including the issuance schedule)?

That way it's clear that as long as it is adhering to the monetary properties of Bitcoin, it can refer to any protocol that preserves those properties regardless of how it does that.

Altcoiners in general are the people who never really fully got Bitcoin, usually because they never really understood money and economics. Each altcoin shows off a different aspect of how Bitcoin is misunderstood. Each altcoin community is a different group of those who in the past would simply have been Bitcoin skeptics.
* Dogecoin represents a general discomfort with investing, so it appeals to people with its silliness to subvert the direct feeling of making money on an investment. The later decision to have continual inflation was the ultimate reflection of that. This felt good to the people who never understood hard money, who felt money was dirty, and who failed to appreciate Hayek's point about community ethics versus the ethics of a large "extended order" where colder economic transactions have their place. 
* Ethereum and Ripple (XRP) both represent a cognitive dissonance about money, a kind of two-faced "it's not money, it's just spam prevention/gas...but we'll be funding development with this non-money." All the 2.0 stuff, though very interesting, at present mostly serves as an a magnet for people who were again uncomfortable about the hard money aspect of Bitcoin. Ironically these kinds of people are no less greedy, they just obscure it with more justifications. Hence massive ICOs or premines to "fund dev." They also represent a lack of appreciation for the the importance of the objective consensus that proof of work provides, but since this can just be put down to creating something very different from Bitcoin that is fine as long as it's not presented as an alternative to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-04-25 04:51:12
It's inapplicable either way. Bitcoin isn't a currency yet; it's an investment that's designed to *become* a currency later on, by which time the inflation rate will be quite low. 
Now even at that time it's still not comparable to money printing by a central bank, where government and its contractors get the money first creating Cantillon effects that invisibly shift wealth toward the government and the corporations close to it.

He raises some great points, but ultimately insofar as what he fears actually turns out to be a legit fear (particularly, "raising the blocksize allows the system to be controlled because of centralization"), then the blocksize will be raised as much as it can, scaling transactions as far as they can go at that size without allowing too much centralization, then if there are still a lot of compelling applications that require a larger blocksize there will be a fork, with Classic Bitcoin and Big Bitcoin. Every holder will own an equal amount of coins in both forks at first, and people can sell one for the other if they prefer one over the other. 
Amir Taaki, if you're reading this, do the points discussed [here]( mitigate some of your concerns? Given this kind of investment arbitrage of forks, it seems that the insane "buy every coffee with Bitcoin" fork would get sold off in favor of the "real revolution" fork. Or even if it were the other way around, Classic Bitcoin would live on. The shopper's paradise fork could go do its own thing without harm to Classic Bitcoin nor even to Bitcoin investors since they'd have coins in both forks. 
Of course a fork like that where both prongs live on will *only* happen if there is an irreconcilable trade-off, such as scalability vs. decentralization, if that actually turns out to be a necessary trade-off.

Trade coins between the original fork and the proposed new fork, coming to an exchange near you. That functions as a prediction market that takes a few seconds or maybe minutes to come up with a definitive answer (overwhelming market cap lead).

I don't know where you're getting 4 cents per transaction (seems high), but zero fees are never going to happen without centralization and trust. In general, zero fees means trusting the admins for every zero-fee transaction. For that you don't need anything fancy, just an internal ledger like you already have. 
Now what you can do is offer a hybrid system of zero-fee small transactions where users have to trust your admins, but settlement in Bitcoin every X number of transactions or whenever an account balance reaches a certain threshold. Users deposit bitcoins and only withdraw bitcoins sometimes; the rest is kept track by your internal ledger. 
Basically you recreate Changetip internally but don't charge a fee but instead offer it as a free service. Legal issues may arise though.

Although programmable money has some amazing possibilities, it would be a grave error to be so awestruck by that future that you dismiss the revolutionary nature of just the narrow use of Bitcoin as an unimpeachable ledger system (i.e., money). There are plenty of Bitcoin enthusiasts for whom just that use is already mindblowing in its implications for the world. In fact I think they are the vast majority. 
People that don't understand the immense importance of what we might generically call "sound money" are easily led off toward altcoins promising the moon. They were the skeptics that are still skeptics of the money aspect, often because money is a very touchy/dirty subject intertwined with government authority and the like. But tell these same skeptics about anything else that is one step removed from the money aspect and their cognitive dissonance and general misunderstanding of money is no longer there to hold them back. They eat it up.
The sad part about that is that the canvas, as you say, really does require that sound money component and the network effect that comes with it. We will have a whole generation of cryptocurrency enthusiasts who don't get the basics but only the advanced stuff, so they will go off building and investing in castles in the air.

Holding is the main thing that gives Bitcoin its value, because Bitcoin is mainly a replacement for gold. Spending gives it slightly more value because it gives merchants a reason to use it (though this is contested by some), and some spending is required at least as an original backstop for the value. But merchant adoption for brick and mortar shops is several years premature. There's simply no way that the average bitcoin-accepting business is going to to see &gt;1% sales from a group that is far far less than 0.1% of the population. There will be niche exceptions, but the average goods merchant is unlikely to be one.

Totally agreed with everything except for billionaires giving away their money. If you give it away it really depends on who you give it to. If you could give it to everyone equally and simultaneously that would be equivalent to burning it (or forever hoarding it), so it's a wash in that case. But certainly most billionaires are not giving away their money in the best way they could, which does result in a lot of wasteful spending, if that's what you meant there. Besides those who lobby the government to increase their wealth, most billionaires only became billionaires by being exceptionally good at offering services/goods/expertize that was extremely highly valued by society, so if anyone should (for purposes of maximizing the general welfare) be deciding where that money goes it should be them.

No mention of the elephant in the room: a more popular Bitcoin means - all things being equal - more full node auditors, and more of them actually using their full nodes for transactions of import. 
"All things are not equal; bigger blocks makes nodes harder to run," you will say. But which factor is greater: ease of running or popularity and importance? If blocks are so big that only 1/10 of the users that currently resources to run full nodes are still able to, but these large blocks enable a 100x surge in Bitcoin's popularity, we have likely experienced a 10x net increase in nodes...and probably more of those nodes will be used for monitoring transaction of greater economic importance as well. The end result would be tremendous boon to decentralization, even if a far lower *percentage* of users were able to run full nodes.

Yep, hoarding money is like anti-hoarding resources, that's the irony. If you go out and spend all your money on stuff, you end up with a lot of stuff, and although maybe you consume it all or maybe it's all services that can't be physically hoarded, the effect is the same: you sequester those goods and (tie up the labor time of those service workers) from the rest of the economy, so there is less for everyone else. 
In contrast, hoarding/saving money is taking *fewer* resources out of the economy, leaving *more* for everyone else. Hoarding money is effectively the opposite hoarding goods.
However, because of the negative association with goods-hoarders, Keynesians and other government/banking interests who benefit from inflation like to use the term even though its meaning is actually reversed in effect when talking about "hoarding" money.
It's the same semantic trick as how the regulators want "transparency" for people's finances, taking advantage of the positive associations with the word "transparency" when it is used with regard to the government. 
Transparent government is good; transparent citizenry is a horrible breach of privacy. Hoarding goods is (sometimes) bad; hoarding money is a nice thing to do, as you leave more resources available for everyone else.

Not to defend Greenspan, but I think when people armchair on the Internet about being heroic and changing the system from within it is extremely difficult to appreciate the social effects of actually being part of a given social group, where your friends and friends of friends and people you have lunch with are all entangled with the system. 
Same goes for things like the Bitcoin Foundation and a lot of these premined altcoin schemes where there is face-to-face meeting with investors and collaborators. The Internet gives this great feeling of anonymity that, coupled usually with physical distance, makes it feel safe and not socially messy to criticize errors openly.

Interesting, Eragmus. You don't seem to be arguing in good faith like you always used to, as there are three obvious overreaches here: 
1) I made a point of *not* defending cypherdoc, as I neither know (nor care) of his guilt or innocence here.
2) Let's just assume he is culpable for now. The case has been ongoing for a long time, but this is the first time I've seen it on the front page here getting upvoted. This case and his gold thread on Bitcointalk flew under the radar until this blocksize debate heated up and his thread was suddenly locked by mods. This isn't conspiracy, just bare fact of convenient-timed censorship as you - to your credit - acknowledge. But to suggest that the censorship of alternatives is what single-handedly caused the surge in support for alternatives is an head-scratcher. 
3) The current Core devs have been around for a lot less than 6 years, and ironically Gavin has been around the longest. But it's particularly odd that you would dismiss the idea that there is a majority who wishes to "overthrow" the Core devs (decentralization does not entail overthrowing anyone...that's the whole point, overthrowing and coups are concepts in *centralized* governance) because it's clear to all that there are many people dissatisfied with their handling of blocksize. I would call that a groundswell, and I didn't mention a majority even though it seems fairly likely to be one. If the Core devs refuse to budge, I don't think it's controversial to say that people will naturally look for alternatives. But beyond that, I also wonder if you really wanted to take a stand for centralization of development. That's taking things to another level. Perhaps you could argue that it is impossible to decentralize dev, but to argue that it would be a bad thing seems to come from left field.
Just overall this feels bizarre. I would have expected a response more like, "Some people are taking low blows, but this has no bearing on the validity of the arguments. A bunch of bitcoiners are worried about blocksize and fronting like they're supporting other implementations, but that's not going anywhere ultimately because the Core devs will come up with a decent solution before things get out of hand, then any such groundswell of support will vanish." That's something I can at least understand, even though I doubt it will play out like that. I did not expect pushback on the idea that development should - like everything else - be decentralized if possible.

As to whether it's possible to make it more efficient, the answer in terms of general security is no. 
Efficiency = Efficacy / Cost
Or in this case:
Efficiency = Security of the network / Electricity used
Phrased to make the point clearest, we can write:
Efficiency = Electricity required to attack the network / Electricity used
Lowering the cost without lowering efficacy *would* be an efficiency gain, but the last equation should make it clear this is a nonsensical endeavor in proof of work, because the numerator and denominator of the right side of the equation are inextricably linked. Since anyone can participate in mining and there are no privileged participants*, the amount of electricity required to pull off a successful attack is always going to move in lockstep with the total amount of electricity used. That is, efficacy increases and decreases in lockstep with cost. Thus efficiency as far as securing all the transactions is always roughly constant. 
However, we can say that if the maximum number of transactions are not being processed the system is operating at lower efficiency than it could be. But when the whole world is using it, the network is processing all the transactions in the world, so barring alien civilizations it is working at maximum efficiency by all measures.
*This becomes important when you look at non-PoW systems, such as Proof of Stake, where we can see that some privilege must be granted and so far a kind of centralized checkpointing system has always been required. The generalized criticism against PoS, as a heuristic, is that "a network where anyone can join and no one is privileged leaves no way to determine who is 'honest' and who is not; therefore the network operates on pure brute force and hence must be as roughly as expensive to maintain as it is to attack, so all such systems devolve back to roundabout PoW."

Bitcoin has been a horrible store value in terms of medium-term stability, but a fantastic one in terms of retaining value over the long term since its inception. Despite the huge plummet over the past year, it is still up an average of 4x per year since early 2011, and that's deliberately excluding the phenomenal 200x rise from 2010 to early 2011 just in an effort to be fair to critics. "Retaining value" technically only demands that the price remain the same, but no one's complaining about 4x per year on top of that. 
It's also a fantastic store of value in terms of non-confiscability and teleportability. That includes non-freezability, non-capital-controllability, and other things that are too awkwardly new to have names yet.
Bitcoin certainly does not meet all the functions of the best forms of money, because to be the best you need to be accepted everywhere, used by everyone. But to an investor that's a *good* thing: you make money by identifying something that people will find very useful in the future, not that people already find very useful. If people in generally already valued Bitcoin highly, it'd be, well, valued highly. That means no more upside for the investor.

If you look at the situation with, say, nightclubs, men already basically know the score: you pay $30 to get in, and they will kick you out without refund for any reason (if a female complains it's almost automatic). People still go because of the value they perceive it provides. 
I'm sure there is a large variation of awareness of how these dating sites are run, with some guys knowing they could get shafted out of some money with no recourse if they aren't careful (or even if they are), and some not knowing. I think in communities that discuss this kind of thing it probably is fairly well known. 
Unfortunately the solution for now is a little like dealing with the state: just try not to stick out. I've found on the dating sites that it's all about image anyway at the early stage, so a quick mundane/pleasant very brief three messages back and forth talking about nothing, then asking for contact info is the way to go.

XT didn't need to succeed, it just needed to light a fire under Core dev, which it apparently has.

XT hangs like a Sword of Damocles waiting to strike if and when it becomes clear that scaling is urgent and Core dev *really* won't budge. 
Even if most users are in favor of a major increase, that doesn't imply XT would immediately gain a bunch of nodes. People are definitely still holding out for Core getting in gear and  scaling, as should be obvious. XT's effect will only be seen as matters come to a head.

That's investing. No risk, no reward. Really you could say "many have lost their shirts" about any asset that had any major downturn, which is just about every asset out there. Bitcoin is more volatile than most, sure, but it's strange to focus on the price fall when the most conspicuous feature of Bitcoin as an investment is how much it has risen. Overwhelmingly so. Unless you think this downturn happens to be a one-way course to zero, there is no reason to focus on the current downturn over any other past downturn (there was a bigger one in 2011, for example) or the many past upturns that have been much, much bigger in total.

A portion of that sell pressure would be there anyway, because anyone who wants to sell bitcoins but sees something they were going to buy anyway available to buy for bitcoins, they will spend instead of sell. In general if someone wants to unload BTC they'd be wise to first look for purchases they were going to make anyways, rather than sell on exchange, wait for wire transfer, pay with credit card, then pay the credit card with a check. If you already have bitcoins burning a hole in your pocket, spending makes a lot of sense - but if there's nothing available that you want, you sell on exchange instead. In that case merchant adoption just broadens the scope of when that dynamic applies.
So at least some, if not most, of the notion that merchant adoption creates selling pressure is a myth, based on missing the unseen: the bitcoins that would be sold directly if they weren't able to be spent.

At least they are finally catching on to the proper way of taking advantage of network effects: don't duplicate ledgers, just use an existing ledger by distributing the coins to every existing holder in proportion to how much they hold. Of course they won't be using Bitcoin's ledger, which has the biggest network effect, because of spite or something. And they have all sorts of special rules that will surely end up pandering to special interests and people close to the project. 
Once again, Bitcoin early adopters are seen as greedy because they got lucky, so their solution is to make their own luck, rather than realize that anyone who buys Bitcoin now is still an early adopter - especially with the current bear market.

Nevertheless, I think it's hard to deny that once adoption of Bitcoin-as-investment reaches a high enough threshold there will be massively increased demand for transactions in Bitcoin-as-money. We'll need all the scaling juice we can get in order to not miss that opportunity, whether that comes from bigger blocks, other solutions, or a combination.

This is a common fallacy, born out of a misunderstanding of money. Any amount of gold, for example, is enough to run the entire global economy (assuming it can be divided small enough and still be recognizable - which is not a problem for Bitcoin). 
To see why this is a fallacy, consider that magically doubling or halving the amount of money that everyone holds does nothing to change the economy assuming everyone notices and understands what has happened. Prices would just quietly be doubled/halved for all goods, people would mentally adjust, and everyone would be as rich/poor as before. The quantity makes no difference. All that matters is *the percentage of the total money supply* you hold, and that never changes in this scenario. 
Any amount of total money supply is fine as long as you can know what percent of the total you hold.

As for your wife, this volatility is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING compared to the usual. If she's not prepared to lose it all, or at least lose most of it temporarily, or to be up a ton then down a ton, and for that whole emotional roller coaster, there will be issues. For example a lot of analysts are calling for a temporary dip to a bit under $100, even though most of these same people expect prices to far exceed the previous bubble top in a few years. The recent level of volatility will not prepare you by any stretch for what's coming, whether it first goes up or down.

Or price simply got ahead of infrastructure during the bubble. This was widely recognized in 2013, and now we are getting that infrastructure built.

There are at least two good counterarguments to the wrench/rubber-hose concerns:
1) Confiscating physical gold that can be searched out and metal-detected is a lot easier and less likely to incite political backlash than *physically imprisoning or torturing millions of people*. 
2) If this becomes a thing, people will start taking more care with plausible deniability, security, m-of-n schemes, and mixing, as well as having some token amount of coins to give up while keeping the real stash secret. Jailing tons of people you know have a good chance of actually being able to give up their coins is one thing, but doing the same when you really have no way of knowing is quite another.

If everyone believed bigger blocks meant substantial harm to decentralization (in the practical sense of Bitcoin becoming easier to attack or control, which is all that matters), there would be very few in favor of bigger blocks. 
I think the opposite, and I also feel it is fairly obvious that staying small and graph-theoretically decentralized will make Bitcoin more vulnerable than being large and somewhat less graph-theoretically decentralized. The vision where everyone can run a full node and most transactions happen over Lightning is an odd one: who is going to want to run a full node if it doesn't ensure trustlessness for the Lightning transactions but only the on-chain ones? Seems like people will only go through the trouble of running a full node if they are using on-chain transactions, and since very few people would use those there would be little motivation for most people to run a full node - even if it were only as difficult as it is today (or even three years ago). 
In contrast, if we have quite large blocks and on-chain transactions remain cheap with billions of people using them, many will have the incentive to run a full node even if it is a lot harder to do. A much lower percentage of on-chain tx users would run full nodes, but it seems to me that their absolute numbers would be way higher.
At the very least, it is not obvious that the opposite would be the case, as is so often assumed.

One of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin is that the mining is "powering" the payment system, and that more mining power is required to process more payments. This is part of the more general misconception that Bitcoin is mainly a payment system. Bitcoin is, by value, mainly a money system for holding wealth, like Gold 2.0. What mining is actually powering, and what additional mining power correlates with, is how much value is being secured by the network, something like the total "market cap" of Bitcoin.
As the market cap grows and Bitcoin becomes trusted for bigger and bigger transactions, the amount of money that could be made in a double-spend grows, so the mining power needs to grow to maintain sufficient difficulty to thwart such attacks. Fortunately, as market cap grows the mining reward value also grows, which incentivizes more mining, and the process thereby maintains adequate difficulty.
If the whole world used Bitcoin, then the amount of electricity used for mining should work out to somewhere in the ballpark of how much electricity some fraction of the global money supply (the amount of money that could be made on a double-spend) could buy. 
You might think that's billions of dollars worth of electricity every ten minutes, but I doubt people would do billion-dollar transactions with only a few confirmations, so I would guess something more on the order on millions of dollars of electricity every ten minutes. Which is probably tiny compared to the electricity required just to power all the heating/AC and lighting in the world's bank branches, not to mention the myriad other direct and indirect uses of electricity for all the staff, transportation to get those staff to their workplaces, energy to manufacture the office equipment they use, etc.

That's the whole point. Bitcoin is just the ledger (including coin issuance schedule and control by the private keys for each ledger entry), not the whole protocol. Changing the technical manner in which the system accomplishes its job of maintaining the ledger does not change Bitcoin proper. Blocksize shouldn't be part of the consensus layer, or of what constitutes Bitcoin, but rather part of the transport layer. Various implementations can fall into and out of consensus on that, while the ledger is unaffected. If your preferred implementation fall out of the main chain consensus, you can stay with it in an attempt to vote with your feet, or you can relent and start using the more popular implementation.

Actually the EM can just choose (i.e., invest in) a fork that takes away miners' power by, say, changing the hash function as  last resort so that their ASICs no longer work or are slower. It's only something that would happen if miners tried to step out of line, not knowing the pecking order. It would be a last resort and would cause friction, but mining equipment is always a short term investment anyway, so miner "trust" is far more dispensable than investor trust.

A soda machine ordering drinks for itself doesn't require this, or even Bitcoin; it merely needs to inform the owner's computer by which the owner can automatically or manually order drinks. The price is already known, there is no negotiation with another machine needed.
A use case for this is when a machine wants to use a resource that another machine of a *different owner* also wants to use: road space, ad space on a panel, bandwidth, water during a drought. The machines can benefit by negotiating, whenever one machine knows its owner wants the resource more or is willing to pay more. 
Machines bargaining or trading for scarce resources without the owner needing to witness it on the fly is the use case. 
If owner input is required for every negotiation and every payment, most of the intelligent resource allocation that is possible simply cannot happen. Instead a clunky system of usage rights and plans prevails (the current system!), where people have little incentive to economize and others are unable to use the resource on the fly even if they are willing to pay a high price (and even if other users would be happy to economize in exchange for a payoff). 
This could all be done with a centralized system that enables such negotiations, true, but 21 seems to be angling for an IoT system that allows this to happen in a fully decentralized manner. This means, for example, robust and efficient meshnets that cannot really be regulated.

That's because people who are healthy in all ways strongly tend to just want to enjoy life in the more natural modes that lead more surely and directly to satisfaction, like mating, socializing, and physical endeavors. Being highly social their whole lives, they will not be set up for thinking outside the norms of society nor immune to the pull toward prioritizing social ladder climbing even if they are in an intellectual field. 
It's the rare people who by some accident of happenstance end up cast out of the social structure for enough time to learn to think independently, despite being mentally very healthy, who can end up making some of the greatest contributions to civilization. They have the mental hardware to kick ass in conventional matters and social gamesmanship, but end up turning their formidable mental resources toward abstruse things anyway, and there they are able to dominate because their peers are only there because they had no choice: their messed up health forced them to either lead a life of mediocrity or attempt the longshot path of gaining some social cred through academic achievements.

$400,000 isn't much for a final return, because you won't see most of it due to raking (unless you take irrational risks with quasi-life-changing amounts of money on the way up, you end up selling a lot along the way).

You're right until the end. Bitcoin's value must also rise to become useful for many of the applications. At single digits the volatility would be insane and security would be weak. Even exchanges wouldn't make much on their commissions. 
What is happening is simply that investors sensed (correctly) that Bitcoin was in a bubble and more specifically that infrastructure had fallen behind price (as was a common observation near the end of 2013). It was natural to then invest in mining and infrastructure. 
Consequently, mining continued to increase by orders of magnitude all through 2014 while the price dropped, and venture capital set new records in 2014 and the pace is even faster in 2015. As VC overheats, the stream of money cannot go there anymore, nor to mining as that's played out for the moment, so where does it go?

Money of today, currency of the future. 
The main thing that is needed for something to be a currency is for just about everyone - or at least everyone in a certain area, geographic or otherwise - to accept it. If we were already at that stage Bitcoin would be a heck of a lot more useful. Rebittances really would be extremely cheap and blow away the competition, for instance, rather that just being somewhat cheaper is certain niche situations.

Excellent comment! 
The idea that small, graphwise decentralization is better than adequate graphwise decentralization coupled with just being way more useful to way more people way more quickly is an exceedingly narrow view. Which scenario results in more people running full nodes sooner? Only a narrowly code-focused perspective could possibly argue that it would be the former. It's also telling when a discussion of decentralization factors makes no mention of price and popularity, which are paramount considerations for the final result. To some coders, apparently, only code and other techy things count in these discussions, despite Bitcoin being just as much an economic and sociological phenomenon as a technical one. 
With regard to trust, we don't need to argue for or against trusting anyone if we can all agree that there should be competing implementations so that users (and, if it comes down to that, investors) are the ones making the choice.

Actually *this* is a common misunderstanding even among bitcoin enthusiasts (and many skeptics as well). It assumes that the main or only function of Bitcoin is to process transactions, when in fact the main function is to maintain integrity of the ledger. 
Imagine you are merely going to hodl your coins for the coming year. Would you be fine if the hash rate dropped to almost nothing during that year, as long as it returned to normal before you wanted to make a transaction? Of course not, you'd take it on the chin as the value of your holdings dropped precipitously because of rampant doublespending throughout the year.
The lion's share of Bitcoin's value arises from its "store of value" functionality, which is where the block reward goes.
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:02:00
A further error with the word "hoarder" is that Bitcoin is still mainly an investment, hardly a money at all yet. Hoarding money is a complete 180 from hoarding goods, so that word usage is already silly and backward, but with Bitcoin (being a candidate currency, to perhaps become a full currency in the future) it makes even less sense. A long-term investment is by definition an asset that you hold/save, so labeling it with the sort of negative implication of "hoarding" is just bizarre. 
I think in the Bitcoin community it mainly stems from the big confusion addressed [here](

Agreed. Here's an attempt at better wording:
Say you're a small-time health insurance provider. If the law requires you to provide insurance at the same price to a 40-year-old who has a strong genetic predisposition for early cancer, and a 40-year-old who doesn't, either both people are going to have to pay more, or if the law forbids this as well then your company will have to insure the at-risk person for a price that may not make any actuarial sense. That is, you may be forced to provide insurance to certain people for a price that will cause your company to go out of business. Larger companies and those more well-connected may be able to shoulder those costs and basically provide welfare/unprofitable insurance policies, but smaller ones may not. It tips the scales in favor of big business, which is really no surprise: who do you think was lobbying for Obamacare? Not the little guy.

It's a one-sided story made to look balanced by semantics.

There is nothing to say that the smallest blocksize currently feasible for greatest robustness isn't 10MB, for example. In fact it would be a miracle if 1MB were even close to ideal.

He shouldn't be trashed, but it also seems a little naive to think a payment method used by far less than a fraction of a percent of the economy is going to result in more than a fraction of a percent of sales. Though I would agree the implicit premise in the drive to get merchants on board is that it'll help their bottom line significantly, and that is for most everyday merchants quite mistaken. If you're doing something like selling soap, you should accept Bitcoin only if you're already interested in it or want to understand it better. Unless maybe you're based on a relatively unbanked country. It's really time to stop harassing and luring in brick and mortar merchants especially, and everyday goods merchants who don't fit niche use cases.

The measure we really want to have is "percentage of population that has both the means *and* the motivation to run a full node." Keeping the blocksize small helps more people have the means, but unless alternative scaling happens in time it vastly diminishes the number of people likely to be motivated to do so.
I feel like the question of which factor is bigger is the crux of the debate, and it seems fairly obvious that the latter factor is more important. But at the very least it is not at all obvious that the former factor trumps the latter.

Hi Justus, 
You're one of my favorite posters so I'm gonna give you my opinion straight-up. 
First of all, until you actually say what the inoffensive question you asked was, it's impossible for anyone to judge either way. Secondly, even if you simply asked, "Do you like peanut butter?" if the girl took offence the general policy of these sites is to side with the female. It's not fair or just, but they see it as maximizing their profits, because the females are much harder to attract and keep than the men. This is how much of the world operates, from clubs to sexual harassment lawsuits to whether it's acceptable to go shirtless in Japan. How the female feels is all that usually matters to the arbiters, whether we're talking governments, private businesses, or even just a group of bystanders. 
This can result in sucky outcomes, but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin or even the business involved insofar as every such site is probably the same, even regardless of country. They won't refund you because they have nothing to lose by not doing so, whether you paid in credit card or bitcoin.

Even more in 2015: 
In summary, Buttercoin is full of shit. 2015 is already on pace to *double* 2014 investment, which itself was more than the entire investment in the Internet in 1995 and was a giant leap over 2013 investment, which was a quantum leap over 2012 investment.

Deregulation in patchwork, which is what your examples all are, is not necessarily any kind of *net* deregulation, since many regs compensate for other regs. Privatization usually involves government still backstopping the entity, which can mean the worst of both worlds. 
Judging the free market based on some "deregulation" is like judging a cancer patient's health based on detumorization. Cutting out the whole network of blood vessels a tumor redirected to support itself isn't necessarily going to be a net help to the patient. It's similar to saying we should eliminate the Supreme Court since that would be a move toward "less government," and if things got worse people say, "Told you we don't need less government!"
One thing in government checks another, so piecewise removal doesn't necessarily constitute any kind of rolling back. And the kind of piecewise removal that the government itself approves, like all those you mentioned? Even more unlikely to represent a net decrease in government power.

That's true, but they can just turn around and say that money is a special case. There might eventually be a constitutional challenge based on freedom of speech, but they've shredded the constitution enough that I wouldn't expect the Supreme Court to be of much help. The only reason to be optimistic there is that free speech is one of the few things that remains relatively untouched.

All? Your argument doesn't imply that we should arbitrarily limit blocksize to 1MB or even 10MB. No argument I've seen in this thread makes a case for any particular limit, just that it should be limited to some degree. 100MB is limited to some degree. So is 1GB. There is no avoiding the actual question of where to set it, and more importantly how to set it and who really should set it - actually might as well cut to the chase and look at who *will* ultimately set it: miners, holders, exchanges, and investors.
And it's not correct to call two orders of magnitude difference in the base layer "absolutely no difference." Sometime the transactions have to be made.

Censorship resistance is conferred just as much by the popularity of Bitcoin as uncensorable money (which can only happen if Bitcoin is allowed to scale) as it is by graphwise decentralization.

This is misunderstood. I gather that the court or their agents (Kraken?) will - or perhaps already have last June - liquidate all the bitcoins first, to convert them into yen. Then that yen will be distributed to creditors. Meanwhile, Kraken is offering to convert that yen for you and send it to your BTC address, since that would be a useful service and will help get them new account signups. 
If they already converted the BTC back in June, that would explain part of the 2014 bear market and could mean a substantial price rise when a portion of these get converted back into BTC.
EDIT: Actually this conjecture may be wrong. It looks like the BTC will be liquidated, perhaps by Kraken, and perhaps after they figure out how much of the claims will be paid out in BTC. That would save on conversion fees, but who knows if the court will allow it. So that means price-negative? Or perhaps Kraken will sell them down on a very illiquid Japanese exchange and someone will have a chance to get very cheap coins, somewhat screwing over the creditors?

We have, and the money has been pouring into the Bitcoin space the whole time, just not the price itself. In 2013 price got far ahead of mining and infrastructure, so 2014 was a year of intensive investment in mining and startups while the price deflated. Mining has topped, price has bottomed, and startup investment is still increasing. Some are calling a VC bubble, so if that pops, price should be favored once again, if not sooner.

Presumably he's speaking as a senator for his state. Ron Paul's position is to ban abortion in his home state of Texas, but not have the federal government be involved. That may be Rand's position as well. There is no libertarian position on abortion; you can be libertarian and be pro-choice or pro-life. It's just that the decision-making process should be devolved to the smallest government scale possible: state is better than federal, municipal is better than state, etc. Some libertarians believe that could go all the way down to the individual, so that it really is "none of your damn business," but others see abortion as murder and presumably would not want a "murderer" in their community. 
(Note for all discussions of abortion: in practice very few pro-choicers who have a considered position are for late third-trimester abortions, and perhaps relatively few pro-lifers have the hardline "life begins at conception" stance. Ron Paul is an obstetrician so he's had to take babies about to be born out of the womb and leave them in a corner to cry to death while all the hospital staff pretend it isn't happening because for some legal/technical reason the baby didn't count as "born" yet. I can understand if you've had that experience why you would be pro-life to some degree at least.)

Untrue. ProHashing has been forced to use Litecoin to pay some of their miners because Bitcoin fees are too expensive for their profit margins. Higher fees due to an arbitrary blocksize limit don't make Bitcoin a settlement layer, they just force people to altcoins that aren't arbitrarily limited.

We are due for a correction, yes, but you're posting over and over with the idea that Bitcoin price should exactly mirror adoption. Markets just don't work that way. Adoptions surges, mining skyrockets, infrastructure explodes, venture capital balloons...price does nothing. Then you're surprised that price explodes randomly? The better question is why did the price ignore a continual stream of exponentially better news for 18+ months. Price does not move on news alone, but on news and sentiment. Sentiment is finally shifting. News is finally going to be priced in. Maybe not quite this explosively, but maybe. We cannot tell.

Right now, unless you are a merchant with one of a certain set of niche use cases, you're probably not going to benefit from "using" Bitcoin directly.

Anonymity and sidechains, but the community can't really be divided and conquered. Ultimately the market will either choose one side or the other on each issue, or - in the rare case where both sides of the coin (excuse the pun) are valuable to the market - we get two copies of the ledger continuing, with every holder's coins represented in both. As an investor, you incur no losses.
In such a rare scenario, the market was simply telling us that we *should* be divided for maximum strength, so it wouldn't be divide and conquer but rather make a few different ledgers being spun off for mutually incompatible purposes. People would use both, and all current investors would default to having equal holdings in both, so nothing off-putting happens there. (Though personally I doubt any such split will be necessary.)

Well it's true that the altcoin enthusiasts are the first to see the effect, but unfortunately for altcoin investors it won't go their way ultimately, because Honey Badger *will* react once it notices its lunch being taken away. The market will not tolerate an artificial cap that is way lower than it needs to be. 
Note that this is not a large blocker argument I'm making here; it can be read as equally compelling from the small block camp's perspective, because if the artificial cap is *not* much below the optimum, the altcoins will suffer crippling effects from going above the optimum. 
The end result is that either blocksize cap will be raised up to near where is optimal (if that is much higher than where it is now), or these altcoins will fail to take Honey Badger's lunch. Either way, Honey Badger gets to keep eating :)

It's probably closer to 10%, but the argument retains plenty of force either way. Money is just a ledger chosen by societal convention. Gold is just a low tech version of Bitcoin, where people maintain the ledger by passing around bits of metal. Because of that, the metal chosen tends to be pretty, but that is incidental to its money function. Gold's value is backstopped far more the social convention to use that ledger than the decorative/use value of the unit. With Bitcoin, the social convention is all it has, and all it needs.
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:03:53


I never got why you would even need Bitcoin for that. An internal ledger interfacing with your bank could probably do the same if banks make a few changes.
To see what Bitcoin will be able to achieve, I think the first step is to isolate the unique features Bitcoin offers. When do transactions need to be trustless, remote, instant, in small/large amounts, irreversible, programmable? When does money need to be anonymous, impossible to confiscate, as good as gold but teleportable?

If we're relying on charity, we may as well give up and go home. Cryptocurrency isn't going anywhere in that case. 
The only way to do it is to have people *economically* motivated to run nodes. That's a complex question that transcends blocksize. There are arguments for smaller and larger sizes on that front, and the most obvious ones of course point to a larger blocksize being more motivating as it would - all else being equal - enable a multiples larger economic sphere than otherwise. This statement doesn't change even if we have LN.

I don't think it's fair to characterize Gavin and Mike as caring less about censor-resistance. Boosting adoption can be one of the most effective ways of making something censorship resistant, and slowing adoption can be one of the most effective ways to leave it vulnerable. Having multiple competing implementations - *especially* during controversy - can also be a very effective way to avoid the central control possibilities afforded by having a central group of devs controlling one overwhelmingly dominant implementation.
@_date: 2015-11-07 05:21:33
It seems like a tacit premise in your view is that a too-low cap would merely slow adoption and that we could raise it later if that happened so we may as well err heavily on the side of too-small just to make sure we don't slip into too-large. What do you think about the argument that the level of too-smallness translates into the degree to which the transactional demand simply spills over into altcoins? At least one mining pool (ProHashing) already claims that they're being forced to do payouts in Litecoin in order to maintain their profit margins, because apparently Litecoin has cheaper blockspace. 
In other words, it seems the assumption about having too-small blocks was that it would merely result in higher fees and later use of things like LN. But what actually seems to be happening, and which seems obvious in hindsight, is that the fee pressure in Bitcoin ends up pushing people to altcoins. Of course if 1MB (or 2MB or 4MB, etc.) is very close to the optimal size then for example if Litecoin tries to entice people to use LTC by offering cheaper blockspace they will suffer the ill effects of too-large blocks, eventually backfiring on them through failure or loss of security so that Bitcoin has nothing to worry about. However, if the optimal blocksize cap is something like 30MB and Bitcoin is capped at 4MB, that leaves a whole lot of space for altcoins to absorb transactional demand. If so, we might easily end up with a situation where altcoins take the lion's share of transactions and net fees, which eventually has bad implications for Bitcoin's market share and network effects.
So isn't picking the blocksize limit a game of trying to get closest to the optimal size, rather than a game of simply making sure it's plenty low? And since picking the optimal size is likely to be a bit like throwing a single dart while blindfolded, having a bunch of altcoins also throwing darts seems of course likely to result in one or more of them hitting near the optimal number while Bitcoin doesn't. This logic seems to inevitably lead to a need to let blocksize be somehow market determined, with no hard caps (or just a very high one as a sanity check) and instead just incentives against excessive sizes (natural ones like orphan risk seem preferable, but that's an argument for another time). Doesn't at least this part of the argument make some sense?

The best statement I've heard on volatility was from a reddit post I can no longer find, but it went something like:
"Draw me a graph starting at today's price and ending up at $1 million without volatility."
Try it out. Is it a straight line? A perfect exponential curve? Whatever you try to draw, if it is at all predictable or not peppered with hundreds of violent whipsaws that scare the bejeezus out of people and make them worry it will go to zero, it becomes obvious that the resulting very safe and rapid gains will result in an unsustainable parabolic pile-in from time to time, which of course must be followed by a gut-wrenching crash or else all those people high on "it's a sure thing, gonna be rich by next Tuesday" will just keep piling in, confident that the Easy Money Machine will deliver on their preferred time scale.

It seems reasonable, but predicting adoption rates (transactional demand) and predicting the actual size beyond which larger blocks would be a net harm - both of these are like shooting in the dark. 
If we set at 4MB and the real optimum cap is 6MB at that time, we'll probably be OK because only some transactional demand will spill over into altcoins. But if the optimum cap is actually 30MB, we'll likely see massive transactional spillover into altcoins, simply because the fee pressure in Bitcoin will end up exceeding the switching costs (for example the cost, hassle, and security risk of having to exchange the LTC one is paid with over to BTC, which is a few percent translation loss versus perhaps something like 6x higher fees; and what if 100MB blocks are actually fine? Then we end up with almost all transactions happening on altcoins, which seems ungood.).

Note that investing money (instead of saving it) does not in general increase the economy's working capital in the slightest. Working capital means goods and labor. Investing does not in general increase the actual amount of stuff in the economy. So what *does* it do? It directs incentives toward directing those resources to some projects over others. That may result in a net gain in societal wealth or a net loss, but there is no way to tell *a priori*. 
Saving the money is exactly equivalent to investing in an index fund covering the entire economy, whereas investing in something in particular is just favoring that particular use over the rest. The average person is more likely to do good for the economy by saving (i.e., investing in everything) than by trying to invest in something useful, because the average person is a terrible investor.

If you are concerned about that, you should be equally concerned that a bunch of miners might centralize and coordinate to 51% attack the network. If you think that possibility means Bitcoin isn't viable, you should believe it's already not viable.
As for nodes, this is really just the same argument in new clothes, because the only way nodes don't have the ability to stymie excessive blocks by their non-fwcilitation of their routing is in your "centralize and coordinate" scenario. Again, you might as well fret that Bitcoin isn't viable because of 51% attacks.

So coding itself is the only thing that counts as "actual work"? Not basic research, not argumentation, not building scholarly publication platforms like *Ledger*? Implementation of an idea into code doesn't even seem as important as coming up with good ideas (assuming implementation is straightforward, which of course it isn't always). Would you say Satoshi didn't do any "actual work" when he wrote the whitepaper, until he actually coded something?

A thread dedicated for that purpose is not sufficient, especially if meta-discussion is not allowed. The scaling issue (and the issue of forks) being off the table colors all manner of discussions by erecting invisible fences where people know not to tread.

Except that the 1MB cap was itself just a hack change. To argue that it "works beautifically" when the excess transaction load is [already spilling over into altcoins]( seems blissfully ignorant of the situation on the ground. The market will always punish the protocol for not optimizing things like blocksize, if the error is big enough. If the actual optimal cap is say 30MB and Bitcoin stays at or near 1MB, then until LN or something comes to the rescue, altcoins are going to have a field day gorging themselves on Bitcoin's delicious market cap. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 13:19:38


You have it exactly backwards. He wants his implementation to be like that, but he understands - unlike many here - that Bitcoin isn't any one implementation. Bitcoin is whatever fork of the protocol for maintaining the World Wide Ledger that the users decide to run, the miners decide to mine on, and the investors decide to support. 
This means that, exactly opposite to what you thought, Mike Hearn does *not* want anyone to maintain strong control over Bitcoin. In fact the whole point of having alternative implementations is to get away from that very situation of having a certain person or   small group in control of Bitcoin. A person or small group can control each implementation, but anyone can create an implementation, and users/miners/investors can support whichever implementation they want. 
This would seem to return control over Bitcoin from the Core devs to the market, but that would be an illusion. The market was always in control; it just prefers conservatism as long as that is viable. As blocks fill up and transaction volume spills over into altcoins, that conservatism becomes less and less viable. At some point, if the conservatism of trusting Core becomes no longer viable, the market will not hesitate to diversify to other implementations.

Although I'm in full agreement that scaling needs to happen ASAP, I also cannot deny that fees actually ramping up a bit will make room for a ton more transactions. Scale now by all means, but even if we don't it won't hit all *that* abruptly. There will be time to scurry around and upgrade, even if that isn't ideal.
I am careful to avoid my certainty that scaling should happen now from spilling over into a false sense of alarm if it doesn't. We'll be fine either way, but we will be a lot *more* fine if we get the scaling done before the next adoption wave hits.

Except the argument doesn't require blocks to max out, only that bigger blocks result in higher fees. The basic economic fallacy being debunked here that high prices are automatically the way to maximize profit. This fact is summarized in the Japanese word 薄利多売, which means "high volume at low profit margins [results in great overall profit]." 
The same fallacy would have someone naively think Ferrari makes more money than Toyota, just because Ferraris are more expensive.
Whether blocks max out or not, what is definitely *not* the case is the notion that limiting TPS will push the price ever higher. People will simply use altcoins before they'll pay hefty fees. Nevertheless, as per 薄利多売, miner profits can be high in perpetuity without any kind of limit to increase average fee size, since there is no necessary correlation between typical fee sizes and overall fee take.
@_date: 2015-10-05 01:01:34
I think you have misunderstood my point.
I mean that the very fact of how *any* implementation is run will inevitably turn off a lot of would-be developers. It's not necessarily anything bad about Core governance per se. The very fact that there are some guys deciding what goes in and what doesn't, will always turn off people who have different enough views. Thus we get a degree of alignment of opinion or basic orientation. Hence, since Core has been the dominant implementation up to now, there is selection bias effect if we start to try to argue about "the devs" or "the majority of devs." 
This would be the same with XT, if XT had been the reference client with Gavin and Mike setting the tone of what submissions would be accepted.
(As for XT showing no momentum (yet) this is proving Peter's point about alternative implementations serving as a kind of user vote. As for fork arbitrage being nonsense, the idea of arguing on forums is you should actually say why you think so. No one benefits from he-said she-said.)

There are clear plusses and minuses to Bitcoin vs. dollars for this purpose, but I don't think the plusses can be denied.

If hard forks are out as a way to resolve contentions, nothing controversial that is of importance in Bitcoin is ever going to get done. Consider what eternal stagnation would do to investor value. Of course it will not actually go this way: the notion from the early days that everyone will somehow "pull together" is quaint, but as a creature of the market Bitcoin cannot be ruled by consensus among devs, but by users running the software they choose and investors supporting the **fork** they like. 
Forking is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin as it's the only way for the market to voice its choices. To take away forking when there is a contentious and urgent matter is to attempt to remove the market's voice; the market will not take kindly to this.

If you google for example "define stonewall," it just says:


Who is to say whether someone is being evasive or merely not answering an irrelevant (sidetracking) question? Sidetracking clearly means avoiding the relevant topic, but what is relevant is largely a matter of one's position in a debate; indeed the blocksize debate has often centered on the very question of what things should be considered relevant. Focusing on something the other side deems irrelevant will be considered sidetracking by them, while the user feels they are being stonewalled. 
It's no use trying to instill a patina of "objectivity" to a debate by pretending that these things aren't all subject to interpretation. Perhaps the idea is to only moderate away the most clear-cut cases of egregious and persistent stonewalling and sidetracking and strawmanning, where the user cannot possibly have had sincere intentions and is caught in a chronic pattern of disruption without any value being added, but that is still very subjective in these controversial debates. Besides which, such people are likely to be downvoted (hopefully *even by their own side*) so there should be no need for moderation in that case either. Weigh the tiny benefit against the insidious effects of having your entire user base feeling like they have to tiptoe around, not mention certain unmentionables, and avoid assuming anything whatsoever about the other side lest they be accused of strawmanning (but assume too little and they sound obtuse and like they are stonewalling).

VC overheated just in time for the price rise, and this probably isn't a coincidence. Price, mining, and VC take turns rising. People are simply deciding which avenue of Bitcoin investment is highest leverage. After a two-year bear market in the BTC price itself, with mining and VC topped out, there is now simply no other effective way left to grab a stake in Bitcoin than to buy the coins themselves.

Who cares? Consensus isn't required. All you need is assurance that bitcoins in the new fork will trade at a much higher price than those in the old one, within minutes after the fork, and then several orders of magnitude higher within hours. It's an investment judgement, and I wonder if even the "leave blocksize alone" crew actually think the old fork would win out in that market arbitrage. I know where my money would be.
Exchanges should prepare to deal with BitcoinA and BitcoinB so that the arbitrage process can play out ASAP, but that's a given.

Red Flag 2: They conflate mining pools with direct mining companies. 


Red Flag 3: They show zero financial understanding, falling for the oldest trick in the book. All the premined coins have a *vastly* overinflated market cap, because most of the coins aren't on the market at all as they are being closely held by the founders, in this case Ripple Labs. 


Red Flag 4: Continual mentions of "white paper" and now the length of the "paper" as if that grants these trashy-forum-post level arguments some kind of authority.

Any holder who is holding as an investment is targeting a specific ratio of BTC to fiat and other assets. Perhaps 80%. If they spend so many coins that they are now down to 60%, they will of course buy back if they are diligent about investing. Purchase and rebuy is the norm among hodlers if the purchase(s) add up to a large enough percentage of their holdings to be significant.

Look at the log chart. When it curves upward on a log chart, that means it's growing faster than exponential, headed for "straight up" (infinite growth rate). As it does, it must inevitably correct downward, fall below the exponential curve a bit for overcorrection's sake, then - if the bull trend continues - return to the exponential trend. 
For example, it wouldn't be strange for the price to fall from $420 to $340, then bounce back up to around $360-380 within a few days where the exponential trendline will be then. And then reach $700 in another month from now, challenging the all time high by Christmas (looks like a 5-week doubling time trend so far).

The bitcoins aren't in your wallet. What's in your wallet are the private keys that can authorize the numbers in one slot of the consensus ledger maintained by everyone to move to another slot in that ledger. Those numbers are called bitcoins. Shifting those numbers to a different slot in the ledger is what we call sending bitcoins.

It's oversimplified and there are some minor errors, but the points ring home. 
TL;DW: Government can't do most of the things people don't want it to do, especially war, with a money like Bitcoin that they can't print, because absent the ability to inflate the money supply the government would have to tax directly, and people won't actually pay for most of the things they clamor for (e.g., welfare) or get morally indignant about (e.g., drug war) or worry about (e.g., war on terror).

Tainting coins for feel-good reasons like catching crooks sounds nice, especially right after a big scam where feelings are hurt, but for businesses the bottom line soon takes over. Will BTC-e, and anyone else taking part in whatever tainting crusade they may decide to start, gain more business by this than they lose? I think not, but the market will decide. 
If people are willing to use an exchange that may refuse to honor their withdrawals because they like the exchange's stance one crime fighting, they can make money and their practices will be copied. If not, they won't. I think the answer is obvious enough. Censor fungibility and you will get routed around, cut out of the economic loop, up taint creek without a paddle.
More likely what is happening here is simply that BTC-e is worried about the mule situation that the Evo dudes are trying to create. I bet BTC-e understands perfectly well what side their bread is buttered on, and would be aghast if they saw that people were thinking they intend to mess with fungibility because that means a major loss in business reputation for them.

Everyone draws the line, anywhere they want. The question is, where do the incentives lead people to draw the line? I think the answer is they lead people to avoid blacklists because they are generally unprofitable. If any business finds that it gains more customers by respecting a blacklist than be not respecting it, perhaps because their customer base is extremely moral, then they can do so profitably, but I doubt such a situation exists outside of a few niche pockets.

But it doesn't. This is one fallacy of many that are all based on the idea that "Bitcoin is a currency." It's not. It's a candidate for a currency, but its main purpose now is as an investment. Gold costs a lot to transmit, but gold isn't a payment system. It's a settlement system and store of value. Bitcoin is also a settlement system and a nascent store of value (high risk, extremely high long-term return so far, even after the bubble prick).

In 2014 the money spigots didn't dry up, they were just redirected from the overheated asset itself to mining and venture capital. Hence the price fell and difficulty soared while startups got record funding. Now it's mining's turn to top out and venture capital also looks overheated, so where do the money spigots get directed?

"Private blockchain" is just the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down at the big financial institutions. It gets them hiring the staff, dedicating millions or billions toward private blockchains to the joy of those parasite companies that have sprung up to cater to this temporary misguided demand, then when they realize what they really need is the Bitcoin boockchain the transition will be smoother so less embarrassing. They'll just quietly pivot.

Well I do get the need to not look like a pumper. The fact that investment is central to Bitcoin, and that that has weird social effects, cannot be avoided but many people will have to tiptoe (or think they have to) their way around it. It's like the fact that price gouging and speculation save lives but still get deplored almost universally. Almost everything about economics and money is counterintuitive to our tribal instincts.

They can wield more power by banning it, but for the same reasons they mostly won't: a countrywide ban/blacklist gives every other country the opportunity to steal its business by not banning/blacklisting. Regulatory arbitrage. Same thing with the Internet. To ban it because it is a threat to statecraft, which it is, simply cuts your country out of the loop on a gigantic part of the future economy. 
In a decentralized system, friction just gets routed around.

It's not just handwaving *if* the merchant immediately turns around and sells the BTC for fiat, which most currently do. It balances out the merchant sell-off effect some people used to worry about, making it so the total amount of bitcoins held by holders does not decrease. However, if you are a hoarder you will do this automatically because, say, if you goal is to hold 80% of your wealth in Bitcoin, and you now have 80% in Bitcoin, then you buy a car with BTC and now have 60% of your wealth in Bitcoin, you are going to want to buy more BTC because you want to bring your holdings back up to 80%. To assume otherwise is to assume holders just choose how much they hold arbitrarily.

Note that an exponential trend started about a month ago. In the past few days it got ahead of that exponential trend, and today it corrected back onto the exponential trendline. It could even go a bit below the trendline today/tomorrow, but then assuming the exponential trend continues it will take out $500 decisively in a week or so.
Study the history log charts. Bitcoin rallies are about exponential rises, and when they go *beyond* exponential they soon peter out. This happens on the daily, weekly, and monthly levels in fractal form as well. Exponential growth is exciting enough; there is no need whatsoever to get greedy and hope for faster-than-exponential growth.

Whoah whoah, hold up. If Rakuten ([楽天市場]( the Amazon of Japan) starts accepting Bitcoin this would be *tremendous* news pricewise, because of three facts people here may not be aware of:
1) Bitcoin has a very poor reputation in Japan due to MtGox. It made front page news several times. This happened right as it was starting to attract interest and get mainstream coverage in Japan. Result: hardly any Japanese investment money is in Bitcoin yet.
2) Big companies enjoy much greater status in Japan. The No. 1 e-commerce company  in Japan accepting Bitcoin would be a mind-blowing reversal from the average investor's perspective. Rakuten is everywhere. Suddenly Bitcoin would be all over the news.
3) Japan has a gigantic amount of money to invest. Also Japanese are pretty big on holding gold compared to in the West.

That is a kind if decentralization. Sites and arbiters can collude, but arbiters have their own rep to protect, and since they can't exit scam for much their incentives are different.

Assuming there is some ideal blocksize cap, those who wish to keep the current cap are gambling that the current cap is the ideal one, with no evidence for why Satoshi's original arbitrary stopgap choice would be the ideal one. Meanwhile there will be various altcoins with various size caps, and one of them will hit upon the ideal cap. If it's different from Bitcoin's current cap, then keeping the current cap is simply a disadvantage and will cost Bitcoin market share.

Which is good. The market prefers conservatism...until things get dicey enough. 
The blocksize *debate* has been dicey, but the pain of full blocks has not been felt yet, so the blocksize limit issue itself has not yet gotten dicey.

Doesn't make sense. Suppose there are million coins, I spend/sell them all into the economy to make them more widely held. Well first of all I'm being made very rich just off that, which is why premines are disliked. 
OK, you may say, but suppose I only sell off half and sleep on the rest. Well the effect is the exact same, except I get even richer. OK, suppose I sell only one single coin and keep the 999,999. The effect is the same except I get even *more* rich. Because of infinite divisibility, one coin is enough to be divided among everyone. One coin for everyone else is just as useful to achieve such distribution to make it useful. So this cannot be the argument.

He's sort of right that nerds will be the first to trust Bitcoin, but there are a lot of nerds out there. Moreover, how many people really understand how and why gold is rare, and why it is difficult to counterfeit? It comes down to arguments like, "If it wasn't rare, people would easily mine it and sell it," but of course the same applies to Bitcoin: if it were easy to break it, with a billion-dollar incentive for doing so someone would have done it. People underestimate how much of their entire knowledge base about the world is simply trusting other people. When it becomes accepted by the experts, everyday people will trust it.

 All the people who don't run a full node any more because they simply *don't have to use Bitcoin-QT anymore* and can just use SPV clients seem not to have deemed it worth replying. Obviously such people are an overwhelming majority. 
And what loss is it really? People that don't know or care enough to run a full node weren't doing much for decentralization anyway, so the node count was effectively hyperinflated back when QT was the only option. People replying in this thread are those who actually cared to run a full node and no longer do for *other* reasons. 
Edit to note also: Not replying are all those people who only run a full node now because of the popularity Bitcoin has enjoyed thanks to it scaling up to where it is now. Had Bitcoin been capped lower we would see fewer dropping out due to bandwidth/storage requirements, but also far fewer people ever getting interested in Bitcoin in the first place to even be in a position to consider running a node.

Lack of government does not mean lack of governance. One example is international standards, but others include merchant law, maritime law, private police, private courts, etc. 
I don't say "voluntarism" is the answer like the other poster, because it just pushes the question back to "how do you define voluntary?" Similarly with the non-aggression principle; what really constitutes aggression? 
Customary law is all about the intricacies of those very questions, and the answers the free market has come up with to minimize violence in society. As custom varies from community to community, there is no one answer to the query, "How would governance work without a territorial monopoly on law enforcement?"

Altruism is just a crutch. Network security will be powered by economic incentives, or it won't be secure. The main "problem" is that scarcity has yet to become a big enough issue for an economic structure to develop, where miners pay nodes or whatever, so that pricing develops. 
By all means let's try to stave off anticipated issues with the network just in case the market somehow cannot handle them, but let's not make the mistake of assuming that this means it is *unlikely* for the market to be able to handle them. In other words, don't let solutions to as-yet non-existent problems make us think we *need* such solutions so badly that we would have to rely on something flimsy and unsustainable, like altruism. This network has to be strong enough to resist the fiercest, most motivated enemies.

There's no such thing as perfectly random anything. Random is just a word we use to mean that no pattern can be detected, but that's of course a counterfactual that cannot ever be proven.

Practically, though, it will just mean there is no known way to get anywhere near able to figure out the pattern, if there is any.

The problem is when democracy is applied over such a huge population. In a family some democratic decisions are fine. You can't agree on everything, sometimes you have to make compromises, but that sphere should be as small as possible and you should have to be lumped in with as few people as possible. 
Democracy starts getting violently ridiculous when it's applied beyond a few hundred people.

Addendum on terminology: 
It looks like the nature of decentralization is that efforts toward ostensible decentralization can in some cases actually end up producing less decentralization than the alternative. There is a certain fuzziness in the word "decentralization" to contend with; if we [replace the word with the substance]( (replace the term decentralization with a term that expresses what benefit we are aiming to get from decentralization), we might end up with something like "more nodes and a greater number of powerful nodes" or "greater resistance to control by any one person or group." 
This reveals quite a bit of additional nuance. Bigger blocks might lead to more nodes overall, or it might lead to fewer nodes but a greater number of powerful nodes, or neither. It may lead to greater resistance to control of the whole network by any one group, but it could possibly reduce the granularity so that someone could control a few powerful nodes and maybe do some damage that way. I'm starting to think the word decentralization is too rough a term.

Business idea: start an oracle service for judging the winners of games/tournaments. If you gain some reputation, you can take a small cut of all gambling or prize winnings via Counterparty betting or whatever. Whoever is first stands a good chance at being the most trusted. If you're a tournament organizer, or perhaps even Leetcoin itself, you could make this part of your business model. Of course if you're judging gambling matches, you might want to operate anonymously. 
Anyway, someone is going to be the first trusted oracle, then I predict we'll see a massive flowering of oracles for everything. Oracles feed betting and other prediction market services, which feed oracles, so this could bootstrap quickly once it gets underway.

There can't be a perfect system, but the endgame here is that as Bitcoin grows in value there will be more and more *financial* incentive to game the voting system, so ultimately either a financial disincentive will be required or a reputational one, which is tantamount to the same in some ways. Without that, someone will just pay people to write sockpuppet bots, or just bribe moderators. There must be a real, transparent cost to messing with votes.

Oversimplifications I think even he would acknowledge; that's just the kind of speech it was, a lot of broad strokes about the sweep of history. One specific error was when he implied that "there isn't enough bitcoin" to fund certain wars. There is plenty of bitcoin at the right price. The reason Bitcoin protects against wars is that it cannot be inflated by the government as a stealth tax on holders, and he focuses on that argument later so it's only a minor issue. 
These are nitpicks, but the point was to inoculate unsympathetic viewers (like themusicgod1) from being turned off by small flaws they find.

Hmm? XT doesn't raise blocksize unless most of the people now running Core abandon it, in which case it seems a foregone conclusion that Core would concede and adopt the change (I think some Core devs have said as much, but am happy to be corrected), making their bandwidth requirements the same. This holds whether XT is adopted or not. In no case, then, would XT bandwidth requirements ever exceed those of Core. Not now, not in the future either.

The market of course prefers conservatism (in this case, sticking with Core) as long as there is some hope conservatism will work. The moment it becomes clear that conservatism will no deliver what the market needs, the market will opt for the slightly more radical step (arguably in response to the radicalism of refusing to scale the blocksize as was originally intended, making sticking with Core the more radical choice).

I'm not sure it provides a useful market incentive to simply pay nodes. It matters who is paying them and why, because if they just get paid no matter what, they may be in it for the wrong reasons and open the network to Sybil attacks. Payment should be organic, as agreed-upon compensation for services rendered, such as relaying big blocks for specific miners if blocks grow large enough (after cap is raised) for that to become an issue. 2 birds, 1 stone.

For better or worse, most people hold Bitcoin as an investment for now, or at least mainly as an investment, so whether people are buying actual bitcoins or just otherwise bidding up the price doesn't matter much to them.

If someone had such problems with Core's governance, why would they have ever gotten intricately involved with Core? Or why would they stay involved? There's an obvious selection bias here, in that we likely would not know the name of talented coders who came to develop for Bitcoin, took one look at how Core was run and ran the other way. Or who tried to get something in but were met with what they deemed unreasonable opposition.
These devs could have developed an alternative implementation, you may say. Sure, but precisely because of the lack of controversy up to now, alternative implementations haven't enjoyed much user support (since no *raison d'etre*) so there would be relatively little appeal there for most star coders.
Now for the first time we have something substantially controversial: the blocksize cap. Now for the first time, there is a chance and a pressing reason for alternative implementations to blossom. We may see an explosion in the number of Bitcoin devs going forward, especially as more controversial issues arise that necessitate arbitrage of forks on the actual investment market rather than decisions made among a few guys. This seems natural as Bitcoin comes of age. It will need the invulnerability this model confers.

EDIT: The solution isn't to ban the potentially questionable content, but to create an environment where intelligent posters moderate (through votes) for you. In particular, activist moderation tends to drive away some of the most intelligent posters, since they know the thread they are posting in could be deleted any time (even the top post on the front page, with over 100 comments) and they are less likely to be the type who enjoy writing cursory comments.

Distinguish between the Bitcoin ledger and the Bitcoin protocol. 
If Monero's ring signatures, for instance, prove unquestionably superior to Bitcoin, that still doesn't mean you should invest in Monero. It just means either ring sigs will be incorporated into the Bitcoin protocol or someone will start a Monero spinoff that pre-allocates a commensurate amount of monero coins to every bitcoin holder based on what percentage of all bitcoins they hold. Then that Monero spinoff becomes an alternative protocol for updating the existing Bitcoin ledger, not an alt-ledger like Monero currently is. 
Same for PoS. Though I doubt PoS is viable, even in the event that it turned out to be superior it's not going to help Peercoin, NXT, or Ethereum holders. The protocols will simply take stewardship of the Bitcoin ledger, and users+investors will support the best protocol of the pack, whether that be the Bitcoin core protocol updated or the NXT protocol, or whatever, *in any case that protocol updating the Bitcoin ledger* and leaving the now-defunct Peercoin, NXT, and Ethereum ledgers by the wayside. 
New ledger-maintenance protocols are cool, but there will only be one main ledger to maintain...the ledger currently known as the Bitcoin ledger.

Well, why is centralization worth avoiding? Because it opens up single points of failure. When considering whether something is harmful centralization or merely useful consolidation, the question then is whether it actually introduces single points of failure, and what the trade-offs are of having a single point of failure with good consolidation versus having no single point of failure with less consolidation.
For ledgers, the "centralization" of having a single Bitcoin ledger that could get messed up is a risk, but it is very strongly offset by the monetary network effects wherein investors can only trust (and will only really invest in) a system where the ledger is preserved come what may. Consolidation outweighs single point of failure. (Or, have a few altcoins at very low market cap waiting in the wings just in case.)
For protocol implementations, a single point of failure is very, very bad. One guy or one small group could mess things up or block needed progress indefinitely. People can be compromised. One might argue that dev resources are limited, but that is an odd argument considering we have mostly the same major Core devs as we had at prices orders of magnitudes lower than now, years ago, when Bitcoin was considered orders of magnitude less of a big deal by the global community, orders of magnitude less prestigious to develop for, orders of magnitude less likely to attract the attention and interest of top coders. 
The folklore theory for why there aren't more Bitcoin developers seems to be that crypto is too arcane so only a shortlist of classical cypherpunks will ever be fit for the job. A simpler explanation is that Core is viciously insular, perhaps with moral backing from arguments like those made by defenders of centralized development in this thread, and hasn't been a welcoming environment for new entrants for quite some time.

Although anyone can contribute, this isn't decentralization because any Core committer can veto those contributions. Final say on what goes into Core (which for now is de facto Bitcoin) is centralized. "You can have any color, as long as it's not blue or orange." This becomes relevant only when there is an issue on which the Core committers are divided; other various noncontroversial contributions from diverse entities will of course get through, but that is no indication of decentralization. The real test is when a controversial change is proposed, as with the blocksize cap. 
You will say XT has been proposed and has gleaned relatively few supporters, but this pointing to the low support is exactly the kind of voting Peter is talking about. The market has not seen it necessary to adopt XT at this time. Pain from full blocks is not an everyday concern at all yet, XT has some unknowns, controversy, etc. Plus Core may well raise the blocksize in time. So I think most supporters of larger blocks are like, "Why bother? If blocks get full and Core refuses to budge, XT is there as a release valve and I'll start running it then."
The market tends to be conservative until things get down to the wire. Having multiple implementations that are more equal in share would allow the market to choose its direction *before* things got down to the wire, not having so much inertia to deal with, thereby avoiding such last-minute "will they or won't they" changes by a reference client team.

Thank you for the tip, eragmus! I appreciate your many efforts toward good faith in this debate.
I agree that ProHashing may not be good evidence since they and their customers deal with altcoins regularly. The fact that they are a business and have apparently been forced into this choice (of course it's possible he just wanted to make it appear that way because he has a soft spot for altcoins) does seem ominous though.
Blockspace certainly has a cost, but like any investment it may pay off and metaphorically recoup itself, even in all aspects. For example, it seems quite plausible to me that bigger blocks --&gt; greater adoption enabled --&gt; more people running those centralized servers than the number of people that ever ran the decentralized servers/nodes. I avoided putting centralized and decentralized in quotes, but it seems clear that the meaning of the words has reversed in this scenario: if we taboo the word "decentralized" and just say that more nodes is better, the scenario where bigger blocks speeds adoption could lead to more nodes than a smaller block scenario. 
Similar reasoning applies to the point that an altcoin with bigger blocks would have weaker security. There aren't just two variables in the tradeoff (1. blocksize and 2. resources required to run a full node) but three: 1. blocksize, 2. resources required to run a full node, and 3. the number of people motivated to run a full node (and how motivated they are). 
This is an argument you've probably seen before, but if increasing the blocksize increases the number of people motivated and able to run full nodes because it allows for greater adoption and Bitcoin achieving greater importance in the world, the net effect could again be one of decentralization / greater resistance to attack, either by more total nodes or a greater number of nodes that are motivated to do validation properly. And separately, government attack becomes less viable if adoption is accelerated, because as with the Internet the theory goes that the government will become more and more reliant on the income generated by the innovation, thus less likely to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.


To recap, I differ on this point in two ways:
1) Compromise suggests a balance between two aspects of a tradeoff, whereas I think there are at least three aspects or moving parts here: blocksize, difficulty of running a node, and motivation to run a node - which is affected by adoption, which is affected by blocksize limitations. That could even mean that there is no hard tradeoff as it may appear (see next paragraph).
2) The reasoning in my first (grandparent) comment was that there *is* a free lunch, in a manner of speaking, in the scenario where we are raising the blocksize cap from far below what is optimal up closer toward what is optimal. Although it is true that any increase in the cap will make it more difficult for certain people to run a full node, it doesn't follow that it will result in fewer full nodes overall (it may, but it may also do the opposite). In other words, it's not a free lunch for those node operators, but it could well be a free lunch in terms getting more security *and* scalability. 
To see that this is at least true is some cases, note that if the blocksize cap were only 10K, there would definitely be a free lunch to be had by raising the cap to 1MB, even if - again - some node operators couldn't keep up. And this free lunch would almost certainly entail more decentralization and more censorship resistance...all the good stuff we both want.

You seem to be equivocating on the word "Bitcoin." 
In the event that miners have a substantial difference of preference from the other contingents (nodes, investors, infrastructure, etc.), the possibility of a fork immediately looms. That makes the word "Bitcoin" now refer to two different things: the miners' preferred fork and everyone else's. 
Miners only have such powers on their chosen fork. Investors alone, for example, can dump coins in the miners' fork in exchange for coins in the other fork, rendering the miners' fork [economically useless]( (unprofitable to mine) in a matter of minutes. 
This is a semantic error more than anything: "Bitcoin" doesn't refer to any one protocol; it refers *dynamically* to whatever the economic majority chooses. Miners have some cards to play in the outcome, but they are far from being a trusted third party.

I don't think there is any reason for exchanges to be able to lose your funds unless you want to be able to make instant trades. If you can put in an order that only fills if the price hasn't changed by X number of confirmations, then it seems you can do it with a 2 of 3 system where no one who doesn't know your private key can access your coins. This still leaves man in the middle hacks where the person you are selling to through the exchange has a spoofed address, but at least there would be no need to keep coins there. You would of course still bear the risks of having your fiat money on the exchange, but fiat security is a lot easier and familiar.

Still I seem to recall several threads getting deleted like that. 
The more hard-hitting point is perhaps that talking about controversial subjects is being allowed if you're on the "right" side of the debate.

He just means that how however much "honey badger don't care," that doesn't necessarily mean it is useless to help law enforcement groups avoid the pitfall of being uselessly draconian. As much as it may look like it, and as evil and dysfunctional these groups may be, their actual list of priorities doesn't look like:
1. Screw over Bitcoin.
2. ...

There are other things they are trying to accomplish. It is easy to make horribly draconian laws without the industry's help. Accomplishing what they want, as otherwise bad as it may be, *without interfering with Bitcoin more than they deem necessary* - that takes a lot of help from the industry. 
The Bitcoin Alliance could just be a front, but at least the ostensible idea of it is help law enforcement not feel forced into dumb laws that mess with Bitcoin (read: delay its success; honey badger don't care about getting delayed, but some of us do) when that isn't actually their goal.

There's nothing inconsistent about believing that exchanges are within their rights to blacklist coins but that such action is bad for Bitcoin. The libertarian solution to that would be to either harden fungibility or refuse to do business with the exchange. 
I personally think this is a tempest in a teapot, because the loss of business will likely be plenty to get BTC-e to rethink their position (if in fact they are actually blacklisting and just appearing to because of the mule issue), or at least keep this from catching on.

By larger blocks I meant larger than 1MB. 1GB may be too big, the rest being scale and balance, sure, but it is not by any means valid to assume that the function is monotonic: it can still be that 20MB results in vastly more decentralization than 1MB or 2MB. (Greater adoption resulting in more people wanting to run full nodes.)

The cost of respecting a blacklist/whitelist is ultimately the cost of cutting yourself out of the larger economic loop. 
The market will determine how much pain businesses and governments are actually willing to endure in their efforts to stamp out marginal criminal activity. I think the example of the Internet shows the answer: "not much." Governments and businesses care far more about the tremendous profits that can be gleaned from having such systems operational, at least once they get a taste.

More seeders aren't needed for the well-seeded content. The idea here is that the seeding that's provided through altruism doesn't necessarily line up with what each consumer wants, and even less what each consumer wants enough to pay for. A price system introduces a whole additional layer of for-profit seeders and enables dramatically faster speeds for what will tend toward the actual cost of data transmission - i.e., very cheap.

Don't know why you're being downvoted, you're absolutely correct. In a trillion dollar network, transactions of $100 million or maybe even a few billion would be routine. At the current hashrate the equipment necessary to perform a double spend would cost way less than that. Now sure it would be more profitable for the attacker just to mine the extremely valuable bitcoins, but that argument applies to all 51% attacks. Unless Andreas simply means to say that no government or other group would bother spending a few tens of millions of dollars to mess with the network, ever. (Which seems highly implausible.) 
What protects Bitcoin is the fact that the hashrate is driven by the market cap incentives. It scales with price, for good reason. At a $1T market cap it's going to take a metric fuckton of money to try to mess with the network through mining capacity.

What matters is the economic majority ledger. It doesn't matter, in some sense, what protocol is updating that ledger. It doesn't even matter what blockchain. It's all about the ledger. That is why altcoins that don't strap themselves to Bitcoin's ledger are fundamentally misguided. Ethereum may need a separate blockchain, but it doesn't need to divorce itself from the economic majority in an attempt to get money to fund development. If it does, and if it proves useful, it will simply be forked into Aetherium, which is tied to Bitcoin's ledger even though it's a separate blockchain.

The bitcoins are being sent to Factom instead of burned (i.e., donated to every other BTC holder)? 
That's a serious dock against goodwill. I guess the justification is, "Look, we're helping Bitcoin, so don't feel bad for making us rich instead of you bitcoin holders." But Factom says they can easily switch to a different blockchain for verification, and may do so in the future. 
Does no one see a problem with this? It's an altcoin that temporarily plans to be tied to Bitcoin.

At that point bitcoin has become some sort of techno-democracy and the "trust in math/crypto!" slogans can be tossed out the window.
You implicitly argue for a democracy, just one where there is only one choice. That would be an odd position, except that there is actually no democracy in Bitcoin at all, and there never can be. Yet it is not math nor crypto we are trusting, either. 
"Trust in math," as far as consistency of the protocol, was always a false rallying cry. "Trust in the market" is all there ever is. Both democracy and dev-ocracy are illusions existing at the pleasure of investors. Piss them off enough and the power of node/dev/miner majority gets revealed as a paper tiger.

The Core devs are doing a fantastic job. However, there is no amount of coding talent (nor even governance talent) that can make central governance of development a good thing.

@_date: 2015-03-26 17:35:54
As a long time adherent of Austrian economics, it was a little unnerving to realize that even the Austrians got it wrong about money. Not just the regression theorem, but the whole idea of a "medium of exchange" itself distorts the picture or least misplaces the key emphasis. I will make the case in this comment.
The key point is subtle: it's not really proper to say that money is exchanged for goods, or even that goods are exchanged via money.
It's fairly easy to see that one can't really speak of "exchanging via bitcoins" without tacitly referring to Bitcoin the system. It is much harder to discern that one can't really speak of "exchanging via gold" without tacitly referring to Gold the system (with a capital G). Because Gold doesn't seem like a system; it seems like a gram of gold is accepted by merchants for a new wheelbarrow because some people will always value it at some similar level. 
But that value from being able to find someone who wants gold for its beauty or whatever is much smaller than the value imparted by the social convention to use Gold the system. And again it doesn't *seem* like a social convention; it seems everyone just uses it because it has the best monetary properties. However, I think we can be sure that very few people are actually cognizant of any such thing. What they are cognizant of is Gold the system: the fact that giving someone gold is the primary or most efficient way to get them to give you things you need in society.
Most rich people in a society that uses Gold are not smiling because they have so much shiny stuff to look at. They're smiling because they have a lot of points in the Gold system. They can get other people to do a lot for them. If their society were to move to a different point system, their wealth would be reduced ten- or twenty-fold. In a society in those times that could mean the difference between affluence and destitution. 
Fundamentally, trading gold for goods/services wasn't ever (or not for very long) about giving someone something they want in exchange for something you want; it wasn't even about giving someone something *someone else* wants in exchange for something you want. The Austrian story is not quite right. Rather it was primarily (in terms of the lion's share of the value) about chalking up points to someone in a point system, and Bitcoin simply functions as a better point system than Gold.
The phrasing "exchange bitcoins for X" leads people toward thinking there is something special or desirable about these points themselves, to someone at least. And surely there is to a few people, and that is relevant for the regression theorem, but it is beside the point: the vast part of the value imparted to a bitcoin is not from the fact that a few people want them for esoteric reasons, but from the realization that the world (or a sizable part of it) is switching to the Bitcoin system.
Under Gold, we could get away with the loose phrasing and the subtle fiction of "medium of exchange" that suggested a conflation of gold's monetary value with its decorative value. We could get away with it because there was no real penalty for getting it wrong. The conclusion was right for the wrong reason. The loose phrasing did no harm there that I'm aware of, which is why Austrians are still able to make a lot of good commentary on the economy in general.
However, under Bitcoin this phrasing does do harm because this time the misconception happens to lead people to the wrong conclusion instead of the right one. It's just the common situation where subtle flaws in an old way of conceiving something that didn't really matter before start to matter now when a new phenomenon or deeper analysis requires more rigor. 
Schiff is caught up in this. He needs to rethink the story of money before he can see past it.

If a user believes they are arguing correctly, because the arguments for one side appear rational and the arguments for the other side appear largely fallacious or inconsequential, they will naturally end up making a lot of arguments for one side and against another. If that alone is enough to be pegged as a campaigner, it seems that no real discussion can be had as people cannot express even their reasoned opinions even if they are perfectly civil and cogent debaters (which is itself a standard very few people can maintain at all times). 
My fear is that the net effect will be that anyone in support of the wrong things who argues too effectively for them will be banned either for minor debate errors that almost everyone makes or simply for being too effective (mod discretion + selective reporting by users who are attracted disproportionately to such an atmosphere). Worse still would be of course if those on the other side, even if equally or more guilty of such debating tactics, would be largely untouched.

The reason it hasn't taken off yet is that Bitcoin is still primarily used as an investment, and because there is a certain threshold necessary before it would make sense to be passing through somewhere and actually look for Bitcoin-powered wifi, and therefore a certain threshold before people will offer this.

It seems to me that anonymous payments are worth more than enough extra to pay for small mixing fees in mixer services, and probably eventually there will be a near zero-fee solution. 
Growing Bitcoin large enough ensures that the pool of people wanting to mix bitcoins at any given time is large enough to maintain anonymity, and that the economies of scale to drive fees toward zero exist. So I think the problem is solved by size rather than conversion to an altcoin, which also entails a fee because of the need to sell Bitcoins, which can be used with Counterparty and Colored Coins, for the altcoin (and back) and there will always be a spread on that.

These kinds of comments might be warranted if Peter had attacked Core or said Core devs are incompetent, but having multiple implementations doesn't constitute an attack on Core, nor does suggesting a situation like that shown in this pie chart constitute a criticism of Core.

You, like just about every other skeptic, are not even informed about the basics. You haven't even thought through the most elementary questions with an objective mindset.

If your claims were true none of this would be debated.
You can claim all you want, but if you'd like to debate you have to actually bring substance. For example, the mining reward and how it affects incentives has been debated in hundreds of very detailed threads both here and on Bitcointalk. You might not notice just because people get tired of rehashing the same debates so they only come up once in a while.

In summary, we want the greatest number of people to be able to run full nodes, but we also want the greatest number of people to *want* to run full nodes. In fact, we want the greatest number of powerful, important and/or wealthy independent people and organizations to want to run full nodes, because this results in the greatest erosion of political will for governments to attack Bitcoin. 
These two goals interfere with each other in the sense that larger blocks than 1MB do eventually limit the number of people who *can* run a node, while eliminating the present limit on how many people (and how important of people) *want* to run a full node. 
CAN vs. WANT
Which is more important? Low blocksize capping maximizes CAN at the expense of WANT. The maximization of decentralization (in terms of invulnerability to attack, which is all that matters) requires finding the optimal balance between CAN and WANT. 
My biggest beef with the small block proponents is the blanket tendency to focus fetishistically on CAN while ignoring the WANT aspect entirely. It's particularly telling when there is no mention of price or adoption rates in these discussions. Alternative scaling *would* be a valid point to raise here, but it is not ready yet and there are too many unanswered questions for it to be relied upon in the event of a major adoption surge. The low-hanging fruit for scalability is quite obviously more likely to be the magic 1MB number that has been treated like a sacred cow. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:26:15
You keep referring to a tradeoff that has always been extremely questionable: that bigger blocks = less decentralization. Sure, "in extremis" anything is bad, but that doesn't say anything about, say, 8MB blocks. How surprised would you be if 8MB blocks led to *more* decentralization instead of less? This could easily happen because it will allow for greater adoption, which is of course what drives people to run full nodes in the first place. The tradeoff premise is specious, yet you're treating it like a foregone conclusion.
@_date: 2015-10-14 18:21:48
You're right. The ultimate solution is to decentralize reddit and have upvotes cost a small amount (Bitcoin is going to require a rethinking of almost everything, communication platforms included, because now everything involves direct financial incentives). Until then we have to walk a careful line of imperfect solutions. Within that space of imperfect solutions, though, I think there are major pitfalls in over-moderation. It's a vicious cycle once you get ingrained personalities feeling like they have no choice but to try and game the system because they feel gamed by the political structure of the moderation system. 
Edit: Alternative subs are a good solution, too, but it is a pity to waste a perfectly good platform as has been for several years. As it stands there is a lot of value leaking away to other subs and forums due, in my opinion, to an excess of moderation and a general sentiment that feels like "it's acceptable to shape opinion through moderation as long as it's the right opinion."

Price stability is certainly not superior to falling prices. Steadily and predictably falling prices would be best of all, but only if this is a natural phenomenon.

Fungibility scares have come and gone in the past. I think tainting is one of those things like works in theory but not in practice. If the Internet, insofar as it's decentralized, treats censorship as damage and routes around it, it seems by the same logic that Bitcoin will treat tainting as damage and route around it. Efficient business doesn't involve voluntarily taking on additional friction for vigilante justice unless the market supports your vigilante justice. Is BTC-e and anyone who follows them going to gain more business than they lose by this tainting attempt? I doubt it. Then who else will want to copy their money-losing initiative?

There are quite a few things people have to understand clearly before they can see the value or potential in Bitcoin and why they should invest.

It's rare to see a critic who actually has some critical thinking to back their objections. However, it sounds like you haven't gotten past the fallacy that "what Bitcoin is supposed to be" (i.e., how it is marketed by some) has anything to do with what it actually is. 
Many proponents, including this subreddit in the sidebar, call Bitcoin a currency, thinking that will make it so, but it just allows people to attack it for not being a currency. Bitcoin is actually a *candidate* currency, now just an investment based on that future possibility. People are using it as an investment. That is why most don't care so much about anonymity and such. 
In evaluating Bitcoin, it's not enough to rely on what its proponents claim, but to look at what Bitcoin actually is. It's primarily an investment, and it will continue to be primarily an investment for several more years at least. It will continue to be volatile, and difficulties with it will continue to appear wherever it interfaces with the fiat system. It really couldn't happen any other way.

Money is merely a claim on actual goods and services, not those goods and services themselves. Hoarding money != hoarding goods or services.

A word is not its referent. 
Our instincts impel us to consider a word referring to a sacred object as itself sacred. The word "moon" becomes on some instinctive level equivalent to the moon. This makes it difficult to redefine words as needed, and perpetually confuses people who are so socially inclined that they cannot notice their nonverbal thoughts at all and thereby fall victim to all manner of verbal traps and systematic equivocations. The error has been talked about by various people all through history: Zen monk Nangaku, Bishop Berkeley, David Hume, Alfred Korzybski, Rudolph Carnap, Amorey Gethin, and many more.

This reminds me of the Federal Reserve and the interest rate hike. 
They keep hinting they're going to raise rates, have meetings about raising rates, mince words about raising rates, everyone thinks they're going to raise rates in December, but if they do raise  they'll have to raise by a lot and then their whole scheme to keep their centrally planned incentive structure intact will unravel. But if they keep bluffing people will catch on, so they try to wait until some "unforeseen issue" can be blamed for further delays. If there is no unforeseen issue, or worse the opposite happens, they will be forced to raise by a tiny token amount just to show they can do it, and probably everyone will say they have achieved something and extrapolate the trend out to further raises. They say they are "data dependent" and have to wait for employment levels of rise before raising rates.
You wanted central planning of economic parameters by Core? You got it! 
Perhaps they will say they are waiting for fee levels to rise in a fee market before raising the blocksize. Isn't it fun guessing at the meaning of various Core conference titles ("Scaling Conference") and phrasings? Perhaps they will be "patient" with the raise and give us a "considerable time period" like Janet Yellen did so we can theorize how to interpret those words. Perhaps some transactions will be labeled "irrational exuberance" (SPAM) by some Core dev "Maestro" who thinks he knows better than the market. It's a good thing we have that poster here who gracious puts the weekly ~~FOMC~~Core dev meeting minutes in layman's terms for us :)

Two easy reasons:
1) The "tainted coins" narrative has died down. Take a look at Monero's floundering market cap. A lot of the auction participants were probably in there to get "government-approved clean coins" because of the fungibility FUD that was floating around last year.
2) There are much bigger and more liquid US-based exchanges available and open to institutional investors. Thus less need to resort to auctions to avoid having to deal with price slippage or shady overseas exchanges. 
EDIT: 3) Perhaps the biggest one: experience with the previous auctions showed that these auctions are *not* necessarily a good way to get bitcoins at fire sale prices, as many had undoubtedly believed.

Not close unless the pace of exponential adoption slows down extremely, which is a failure scenario for Bitcoin anyway. 
Anyway, block reward and miners fees are really not that different. If you support artificial floors for fees, it transfers money from users to miners similarly to how increasing the inflation schedule would, since every spender is a holder and vice versa, so you should also support raising the block reward eventually if the economic majority supported it. It's no biggie as long as there is no centralized mechanism for control, which is effectively what the devs implementing the hard cap try to do.

In general the question of "whether or not something is priced in" depends on the level of maturity of the market. Bitcoin's market still isn't that mature in that most of the players are still amateurs, and many of the experts are occupied by winning (or manipulating, if you like) money away from those amateurs through price scares and other tactics. There just aren't that many experts capable of properly pricing in things so as to guarantee that everything known in the future is priced in. 
Oh and it also depends on how radically uncertain the future is over what timescale, and in Bitcoin that timescale is quite short. We don't even know much about where the price will be on the auction day. So that also makes it harder to price things in, at least until they are very close to happening.
 The auctions are arguably mostly priced in, but who knows. The nice thing about this auction is it's happening at a much lower price than the last one, so the overall impact should be much lower.

You view decentralization as black and white.

Quasi-decentralization is plenty for most purposes, as long as you can pay extra for more.

It does, but it runs off Bitcoin *and* it was issued through burnt bitcoins, meaning that instead of selling bitcoins to buy an altcoin (thereby decreasing the value of everyone else's bitcoins and enriching the altcoin founders) the bitcoins were destroyed to produce XCP (thereby *increasing* the value of everyone else's bitcoins and given no money at all to the founders). 
It was the only altcoin issuance that added to Bitcoin's market cap rather than subtracting from it, and that gave no money to the founders. Contrast this with the $25 million Ethereum got last summer when they have yet to launch a product.

Antifragile means two things:
- Attacks make Bitcoin stronger.

It's just that the current daily coin issuance (whatever is left after miners who are "mining to hold" take their desired amount) seems to just about evenly match current investor inflow.

Where did I say that? All I am saying is that assuming a sizable contingent demands larger blocksize caps, the availability of implementations like XT that provide such larger caps (and many people deem viable) puts the Core devs in a position where they either raise the cap substantially or they lose some of their market share. They always have the choice to raise the cap or not, of course. It just becomes a tradeoff. Do they want to fritter away political capital (dominant/reference client status) on such a minor thing? Maybe, if they deem it not so minor.
You are right to point out that Core is much more likely to raise the cap if things get dicey. That is why this debate worries me less than some of my fellow large cappers.

The risk of holding through a devaluation storm is offset by the degree and speed of devaluation. For example if you think there is a 2% risk BTC fails during the devaluation period but the devaluation is 20%, then holding BTC your expected loss by converting to BTC is 2%, whereas your expected loss by staying in yuan is 20%. (Neglecting smaller BTC market moves.)
If the risk of failure of Bitcoin during a given period is a lower percentage than the expected percentage of currency devaluation during that period, it would be an asset protector.

Yes, every time Bitcoin grows an order of magnitude in average price, the user base grows roughly an order of magnitude. For now Bitcoin is more of an investment since many of the mainstream benefits won't come until later, but consider at the next order of magnitude or two how much more of a user base there will be to serve by offering Bitcoin as a payment option. 
The implications of Bitcoin's investment growth rate so far alone have dramatic consequences for the size of its user base. At 10x or 100x the users, offering a Bitcoin payment option becomes not just a novelty but good business.

This is funny but as a tip it is worse than useless. "Past performance is not an indicator of future returns" is a bullshit legal disclaimer, not good investment advice. Ever hear of the time-tested investing adage, "The trend is your friend"? Past performance, while by no means a guarantee, is absolutely an indicator of future returns. The trick is not to get distracted by the short-term shifts. 
Now, if you can identify what drove past performance and you know that those drivers are no longer present, then you have reason to doubt the continuance of the long-term trend. But only then. In no other area of life would you imagine that the past trend tells you nothing about the future. Things have fallen down when you dropped them so far, but that's no indication that they won't fall *up* today??

You're equivocating on the word "speculate." To speculate as in simply chase prices is one thing, but to speculate as in buy in anticipation of long-term gains is quite another. Price chasers serve no purpose,* but long-term investors provide the biggest driver to innovation by incentivizing all the companies to take an interest in the space in the first place.
Investing in bitcoins directly and investing in infrastructure are two money channels that tend to find balance as they leapfrog each other in the meantime.
*Edit: Actually this isn't true: unskilled short-term speculators create volatility, but skilled short-term speculators decrease volatility by buying the dips and selling the peaks, cooling the hype and softening the scares. Unskilled speculators have less and less influence because they are constantly losing money, whereas skilled speculators have more and more influence because they get more and more money. Speculators who know what they are doing are very helpful.

No incentive because full nodes are not really in short supply yet. When blocks get bigger and miners have to start relying on full nodes to propagate their big blocks, they will start getting paid. Need is what creates incentive, so there won't be incentive until there is need. Trying to volunteer and donate this into happening preemptively is a nice gesture but it's just not going to be big enough. 
Not a tragedy of the commons, by the way, because a commons requires ownership to be illegal. Everything in the Bitcoin network is privately owned property.

It sounds like you have a comic book interpretation of libertarianism where "there are just, like, no laws or something."
This kind of exit scam is a vulnerability of fully anonymous, *centralized* markets that don't use multisig. Users chose to take the risk because they wanted the benefits. If you're just saying there's no recourse, well yeah, but that has nothing to do with libertarianism. In a libertarian system there is law enforcement, it is just private. But in this situation neither private nor statist law enforcement can do much.

Once there is a need for the market to work, it will work if we let it. Most of this debate arises just because we're anticipating future scenarios. A fee market only deals with current fees, and right now there is no economic need for fees to be set carefully since we have plenty of resources versus the demand; of course the market does anticipate future scenarios in the broad sense: the Bitcoin price.

Deflationary spiral is a holdover from the age of propaganda, where authority figures could simply point to some aspect of something to make an argument that favors their interests while ignoring the other aspects. Deflation is bad for the borrower, but good for the lender (and this is only if the contract doesn't specify adjustments for inflation/deflation). A weak currency is good for exports, but bad for imports (and bad for the factors of production imported to produce those exports). Deflation is a fantastic blessing for everyone but a few specific people, but in the age of propaganda all this could be safely ignored by the authorities by simply not commenting on those benefits. 
There is no characteristic that more strongly identifies someone as an authority figure than their ability to state whichever side of two complementary aspects of an argument suits their needs, especially the weaker side, and even to switch between them at will like we see with the Fed's comments on low oil prices being a good/bad thing depending on their agenda and propaganda message of the moment.

I would have said the fact that van der Laan banned him for such a thing is at least as questionable in terms of professionalism and maturity. But no, maybe you're right that he's not the best team player in terms of "playing ball" with Core's governance. If that is the standard, we are simply looking at these events and quotes from different perspectives and therefore seeing different things as acceptable. If forking causes chaos or is considered to be forcing his way, then I guess I am not familiar with the proper etiquette. To me, it seems that if you have a large enough difference of opinion, forking is the natural thing to do. I don't see Bitcoin as Core, or as a monolithic project. I see it as whatever combination of contributions that serve to maintain the healthy operation of the ledger and its monetary rules. This view doesn't treat "causing chaos" as necessarily or inherently a bad thing if things need shaking up due to inertia. It doesn't treat Core governance or desire for consensus as necessarily something to be followed if there are large differences of opinion. 
If you don't hold that view on what Bitcoin is as a project, I can see how you will disagree when I say Mike seems benign while some other devs seem out of line at times. The disagreement then is not really about people, but about the fundamental question of what Bitcoin really is. My perspective can be summed up as saying that Core has nothing to do with Bitcoin except that it happens to be the most popular implementation up to now. 
The implications of this starting point include: 
- The idea of "majority of developers" becomes a less known quantity since it is unclear how many devs there would be if not for Core's dominance thus far
- Bitcoin isn't an "inherently team project," but rather ultimately (once under enough attack, at higher prices and adoption levels) a looser collection of contributions that come together in various ways and in the form of various implementations whose popularity is determined by market inclination
- Bitcoin isn't any one open source project or repo, in that it can be forked without necessarily stopping the various forks from contributing to advancing the very same ledger
- Someone can perhaps cause chaos (more like make waves) by forking off, or by arguing with governance policy, but that can be just what was needed (since rigid adherence to team solidarity norms is not necessarily a good thing, especially if this is becoming the very source of the problem). I think Mike has been unfailingly polite. Rather the things he actually suggests are what ruffle feathers. He makes blunt suggestions at times, doesn't avoid saying things that people might find alarming for the sake of preserving group cordiality at all costs, etc. That could be called immature depending on your perspective, but again I think it comes down to a tacit assumption about what it is we are doing here: teamwork on a single project, or looser collection of contributions as described above? 
- The same goes for my claims of bad behavior by other devs: the things they do and say will be considered bad only with my perspective on what Bitcoin is; with the perspective that Bitcoin is a single monolithic project (Core) where teamwork and solidarity are essential, their words and actions may be completely unobjectionable. The same goes for Blockstream, and the logic by which it was founded.
I think we are mistakenly arguing about persons when it is really a difference in starting assumptions about visions for how Bitcoin development is to ultimately move forward. I would say yours is the default/obvious view, and mine is a view that attempts to take into account future pressures that would make centralized development too vulnerable (if we additionally disagree on blocksize, the urgency of this kind of thing will also present differently: I see dev centralization as a clear and present danger plus a likely future issue that will absolutely have to be remedied even if we get past the blocksize issue without doing so, whereas to you it may look like a theoretical and questionable long-term goal not very relevant or worth talking about today).

Unfair was something you could have said back in mid-2011 when the price surged to $32, but that criticism ended forever when the price fell back down to $2. Bitcoin was in the news, people had a chance to buy, but they were too busy penning obituaries. And again when it fell from $266 to $60. It was massively in the news then. People had their chance. People still have their chance, but they won't buy because they don't have the vision or the fortitude to take such risk. Early adopters that still have any sizable amount of coins held through extreme risk, watching their notional fortunes get 10 or 20 times smaller but they still refused to sell. Unfair my ass!

It's so far in the future, especially in "Bitcoin time," that it just can't be rationally talked about now. Keep in mind that significant miner fees to spend whatever coins you have held are functionally similar to raising the 21M coin limit. 21M is just an arbitrary number; what matters is what *percentage* of the total coin supply you hold. 
Dilution of your coins' value through a 1% inflation over 5 years leaves you with exactly the same amount of purchasing power as if you held your coins for 5 years then paid a 1% fee to use them to buy a house.
Artificially subsidizing miners so that 1% of the coin every 5 years goes to them can be done through fee floors (blocksize limits) or through block reward increases. Satoshi set it up that the 21M coin limit will remain for plenty enough decades to set it up as a flagship for sound money. After that the economic majority will decide.

The next thing is a new protocol for updating Bitcoin's ledger, not a new ledger. 
It makes sense to upgrade your protocol, and if the core devs won't do it then maybe an "altcoin" dev will, but to create a whole new ledger is just a money grab. A serious altcoin dev would take the Bitcoin ledger as given and create an alternative protocol for updating that ledger. This can be done fairly easily by creating an altcoin but distributing it to every Bitcoin holder proportionally to how many bitcoins they hold. For example if you hold 1% of the Bitcoin market cap, those same private keys now also control 1% of the altcoin's market cap. In other words the two coins share the same ledger, making the new coin just an alternative ledger-maintenance protocol, not an alternative ledger.
Every hodler is free to switch between the two protocols, and people that don't care will still have their money no matter which protocol wins.

Not deleting valid discussion would go a long way toward disincentivizing bandwagon voting. If you want to ban something, you have to be able to control every avenue. You cannot control voting on reddit, though, so restrictions on content and people naturally leads to vote brigading.
It's very strange in the first place to ban something you don't want people to see, because what normally happens is people post that thing and then it gets refuted to death and is no longer posted because it will no longer get upvoted. Censoring it just aborts this natural process; it doesn't abort the ideas though. They will always find their way in somehow, but this time without the benefit of open discussion to squelch their tempting falsehoods. 
If the content the mod team wishes to censor were really so horribly wrong that readers of this sub needed to be shielded from it, letting it all be aired out for a few months would have defeated it easily as people would learn how to refute it.

For most XT supporters I think it is - most like it just because of 8MB, not for XT's mission qua alternative implementation - though as the debate wears on more and more people see the problem is being not limited to blocksize caps in particular but centralized dev in general. As this sentiment revs up, more people will gradually switch to XT (or something else), but nevertheless I think the real surge comes when/if Core were to fail to move in time, since then there is real urgency. Or whenever the next big controversy happens (blocksize again, or some other issue). Peter's point is about the longer trend, I think, with the caveat that Core could speed up the trend dramatically if they obstruct blocksize cap increases for too long.

Controversial issues (like blocksize) are where this model shines. Users can vote when the issue comes to a head (it hasn't with blocksize; only debate on it has, in advance of the actual pain of full blocks, because of not wanting to get caught with our pants down when the  mainstream comes knocking). 
For really controversial things, this model even opens the possibility of on-exchange fork arbitrage - a kind of prediction market for fork success, which I see as the gold standard for definitive decisions.
In short, this puts investors in the ultimate position of control. Or rather, it reveals that they were always in control, but allows that control to be exercised more finely. Rather than just "sell BTC if Core doesn't do what we like," we have the much less damning situation of "sell Core BTC for XT BTC during the first few seconds or minutes of the fork if Core doesn't do what we like and XT does." Or if XT then starts going in a bad direction (say blacklisting*), they can fork back to Core (or something else) by the same market process. Either way, hodlers can just sit back and relax.
*It's doubtful we'd need to take it all the way to fork arbitrage for this one, since it should be almost universally rejected. However, one can imagine a future where significant corporations support blacklisting. In that case we say to them, "try your idea on the market and see which gains the overwhelming market cap." It'd be a joy to watch them waste money trying to support their version. In fact, the winners would be taking their money. It's a beautiful system, but only possible when we have multiple implementations each with substantial support

To see why this is wrong, just think through what happens if you are one of those people.
 You invested a sizable portion of your net worth early on, and IF you never sold you ended up with 100 or 1000 times as much wealth. Even if you only invested 10% of your net worth initially, you are now 10 or 100 times wealthier than when you started. If you had $10K (and invested $1K), you now have $100K or a million. If you had 100K to your name (and invested 10K) you are now a millionaire or more. That is a major life change, but only if you sell some coins or spend some. Otherwise you would be a millionaire on paper but living like you only had modest savings. Why would you do that?

Or, if you think you have a better protocol, build it around a snapshot of Bitcoin's current ledger. That way every Bitcoin holder has the same percentage of the market cap of both coins, making the new protocol merely an upgraded Bitcoin, not an altcoin at all in the sense of being an alternative ledger. If the new protocol proves to be superior then that becomes the new Bitcoin. No need for sidechains either, since every old-Bitcoin holder already holds an equal amount of new-Bitcoin. People who slept through the change will just notice Bitcoin got better. Their private keys are safe. Their wealth is safe.

If those cryptocurrencies were serious about the actual success of their system rather than just making a quick buck, they would ride on Bitcoin's ledger. They would make every Bitcoin address's private key able to access an identical percentage of their new coin's total supply, thus making it not a "new coin" (new ledger) but rather a new protocol for updating Bitcoin's existing ledger. Then all Bitcoin holders would automatically be holders of both, and then when and if the new protocol proved superior (it would take at least a few years to gain a track record) they would have no problem moving to the new protocol since they still own the same percentage of the original ledger (currently known as the Bitcoin ledger). 
So alt-ledgers are just pump and dumps, but alternative protocols for updating what is now known as the Bitcoin ledger are quite welcome innovations.

The argument is correct, but not about Bitcoin the protocol. It is correct about Bitcoin the ledger (including coin issuance schedule). The protocol may fail for some technical reason, but the ledger can always live on and be adopted by a different protocol. Every investor/holder's money remains secure that way.
Alternative ledger-updating protocols are good competition. Alternative ledgers are just silly. Bitcoin the ledger is what matters. Bitcoin the protocol is replaceable.

Smart contracts are absolutely part of Bitcoin's future, but without an infrastructure to work with a lot of them can't really be implemented yet. OpenBazaar is using them, for example, so a lot of the talk about smart contracts is veiled because the interesting thing is the applications, not just "smart contracts" in the abstract. Counterparty is doing smart contracts on top of Bitcoin, but until actual applications arise there will be a lot of development that flies under the radar.

No one really hit on the core reason why Ethereum has this vulnerability where it might commit a quasi-suicidal hardfork to roll back investor errors: Bitcoin's first-mover advantage and network effect has forced competitors to take all sorts of short cuts in an effort to achieve high market cap quickly. ICO/premine is one such shortcut, and this "funding of development" caused centralization of influence, as well as an incestuous connection with TheDAO incentivizing insiders to continue recommending it as completely safe even as hundreds of millions of dollars poured in, all as part of the effort to pump as fast as possible. 
In I've noticed a pervasive tendency to conflate short-term market cap with success, validating the basic principle long held by many in the Bitcoin community that altcoins are *fundamentally* pump-and-dump schemes, in that they use a bran new ledger when they merely want to introduce a change in protocol,and if they wanted their project to succeed they would use the world wide ledger already established.

If it is twice as easy for the average person to understand Bitcoin's value proposition, they are twice as likely to invest, from which we can expect roughly a doubling in price once the new way of explaining is incorporated into the community repertoire (insofar as Bitcoin the community recognizes the utility of the new method of explanation). Innovations in explanation can be extremely powerful in moving adoption forward. 
Edit: However, I think to get the kind of gains that will make for explosive growth we'll need a visual method of explanation. Not just visual aids but visual or mechanical metaphors with content where the aspects and "moving parts" of the metaphor correspond clearly and cleanly with whatever is being described.

As a quick response, if people support what is in their best interests and converge on a single consensus (I agree with this), then why would there be 25% stragglers resulting in two separate high-market-cap chains? 
I think people's interests (i.e., their investments) necessitate convergence on a single ledger and single set of monetary rules. We can perhaps call this the "monetary consensus layer." Meanwhile, I think the blocksize should be (though currently isn't) part of the transport layer, not the monetary consensus layer. Some have noted that this aspect of the transport layer has crept into the consensus layer, producing the current situation. In other words, I don't see that the blocksize (nor many of the other non-monetary consensus aspects) need necessarily be part of the consensus. For example, some have floated the idea of a user-selectable blocksize cap. Set it too low or too high and you will have problems due to either being out of consensus or due to getting onto orphaned chains, but that could bring about self-regulating behavior through the incentives at play. This approach seems too much "leaving it to the market" to some I'm sure
Core dev have done a great job so far, but if dev need not be centralized, it eventually must not be. Again the point about majority/minority of devs only applies within the context of Core=Bitcoin, which is the very issue in contention. I don't really think many people are rallying behind Gavin just because it's Gavin (some surely are; he has fans, as do other devs), but rather because he is proposing larger blocks. This is entangled with the issue of dev centralization, since the blocksize issue is revealing the problems/benefits (depending on your perspective) with centralized dev, and yes XT is about both bigger caps and dev decentralization so it makes sense Mike continues to push it. It also makes sense that it hasn't got much support yet, since most of its supporters don't really care who offers a larger cap implementation: they default to hoping Core will do it, so their support for XT (or whatever turns out to be the larger cap flagship implementation once we are at the point where blocks are getting too full) is only a kind of "yeah if it comes to that and XT is the most viable big cap implementation, I'll sign on then." For now it'd only be symbolic to run it. The test comes when blocks are seriously full, fees are surging and mainstream adoption is at our doorstep. Then if people continue to hold out for Core's scaling or for LN, we can say XT is ineffectual. I myself don't have a great preference: bigger cap sooner through Core dev increasing it would be nice, but bigger cap later but with the added bonus - in my view - of decentralization away from Core would also be nice.

Starting with POS means centralized distribution as an IPO, which seems unquestionably inferior as an investment because people do not want to invest in something that so closely resembles a deliberate scam, even if the intentions of the creator are presumed good. If you really wanted to do POS, bootstrapping the distribution off the existing Bitcoin addresses would be the best way...but that means no extra windfall for the creator.)

It seems a little unfair to say Bitcoin is hard to secure, bar none. Email is hard to secure. People choose their level of exposure depending on how competent they are and how much time they are willing to invest toward security. In the early days of email, you could take a risk and send naked pics of yourself to your S.O., but if you weren't either competent or took the time to be sure of what you were doing, you might have accidentally CCed your entire office and lost your job, or worse. Or a business might have attached a misnamed file of its internal data in an email to a customer, etc. 
Businesses and people that want to gain something from new tech will take pains to use it properly. Considering Bitcoin will for at least the next few years be mainly an investment, the care an investor will take to protect their net worth is the standard to look at. Some people will lose some coins, but as long as people don't try to hype it as "safe and mainstream ready" or already "the currency of the Internet" people will enter knowing the risks, and they will keep most of their coins in cold storage that simply involves writing down a set of keywords.

And to be fair, the same applies to the upside. If the price rises $30-50 it means zilch. A rise to about $800 would warrant an eyebrow raise. Above $1000 maybe look into the cause (likely the halvening). Above $10,000 time for a mini-celebration.

Miner consensus don't mean jack without investors and users and other infrastructure. They can fork off and mine their own coin while investors dump it toward zero. 
But to the original question, the 21 million coin limit is merely symbolic when you think about it. It could be raised if the economic majority agreed, and that's not a bad thing at all, because it's not essentially different than transaction fees. If you pay 1% toward fees per year on average or 1% toward block rewards on average, the effect is the same: 1% of the wealth went from users to miners. You could say you will just hold forever and not pay the transaction fee, but holding literally forever is the same as burning your coins. If you ever want to spend them, you pay the 1% fee. 
So although it can be argued that raising the 21 million coin limit will affect saving vs. spending incentives, what cannot be coherently argued is that a market-driven increase of the 21 million coin limit impairs Bitcoin's sound money function any more than transaction fees do (assuming the actual wealth transfer effect is the same). 
People like the 21M limit because it's *hard*, because they are stuck in the old paradigm where without a hard limit the central government and central banks will run amok and break promises, inflating away your savings and hurting wage-earners through Cantillon effects where the politically well-connected get the newly printed money first before prices have been bid up. 
Bitcoin is not centralized, though, so there the hard limit is merely symbolic. The market will decide, via the economic majority of investors and infrastructure operators and users, how much miners make in perpetuity - whether through block rewards or fees or whatever combination. If ultimately fees don't provide enough security because they are too low, it may make sense to raise the 21M limit instead of creating fee quotas (and note once again that the effect on Bitcoin's sound money status is virtually identical).

How the quote applies to fallacious economic thinking in monetary policy and in relation to Bitcoin:
Since money is just a claim on actual resources, not those resources themselves, hoarding money is just hoarding claims, not exercising those claims. It takes nothing from society when you hoard money; in fact spending money is what takes resources from society. 
To hoard food, for example, is to leave that much less food for everyone else. To hoard money is the opposite: you forego those resources to which you are entitled, leaving that much *more* resources (food, etc.) for everyone else.
Moreover, from Bastiat it is also clear that hoarding bitcoins is a temporary loan to everyone other bitcoin holder, making all their coins temporarily worth more because there are that many fewer coins chasing the same amount of goods. And burning bitcoins is simply a donation to every other holder, as you have taken your claim check that entitles you to goods and services within the Bitcoin community and ripped it up, again making everyone else's coins worth more, but this time permanently.
So hoarding and burning money should be thought of as the very opposite of hoarding and burning resources. It is in fact, respectively, loaning and permanently donating those resources that you would otherwise have claimed from the rest of the community.

You're right, but the reason is that intrinsic value is a dead end. 
Bitcoin units are valued in the market because Bitcoin's excellent potential utility as a money system has led enough people to store wealth in them and accept them for goods and services that in effect a social covenant is formed whereby Bitcoin is treated as good money among a sizable community. 
That's where the lion's share of gold's valuation comes from, not from its ~~intrinsic~~ **non-exchange** value (such as the demand for its use in jewelry and electronics). If no one used gold as a store of value, central banks stopped using it in settlement, etc., its price would be almost nothing compared to what it is now.

DAC isn't quite right, because the lines of what constitutes the corporation are dynamically shifting. Functionally a Bitcoin-based DAC/DAO is more like a set of interacting contracts in the blockchain that, when the conditions are right, weave together temporarily to form more complex business structures, or more generally incentive structures, that may (or may not) also incidentally mobilize some kind of human work.

I don't wish to defend Ethereum, but splitting into "different coins" isn't really what happens in a practical sense when we look at the ledger. Everyone retains equal stake in both, the market decides a winner (or sometimes both win), and holders benefit from any and all wins. New investors must choose which they want to buy, but either way holders benefit equally. In effect, for hodlers, there is only one total ledger and they continue to benefit financially from any and all successes in any "sub-ledgers," while any failures in any of the sub-ledgers just result in the money getting reabsorbed into the other sub-ledgers, resulting in no change in the total ledger from the hodler perspective. 
In summary, there is no loss of purchasing power from isolated failures of a sub-ledger, but a gain in purchasing power from any successes. Seems like an unmitigated blessing to me.

You're just describing why a dramatic price fall wouldn't kill Bitcoin's functionality, which is true. 
The actual reason for the price to rise or fall would be fluctuations in how many people know about, understand, believe in, and are able to invest in Bitcoin. The one we can do the most about is the "understand" part of the equation. There are so many arguments and points that need utmost clarity in order for people to really get them, that I think a visual presentation would help immensely.

It should cover everything from the basic workings of Bitcoin to the nature of money itself, open source software, and all the implications of decentralization.

Updates don't require consensus. A determined majority (or even a minority) can update any way they please, and they *will* do so the moment they judge the friction of changing the PoW algorithm (to really fork away) to be less detrimental than the update is beneficial. 
As for blocksize, the deadweight loss from 1MB being low is still quite small. That may change soonish, though. Eventually either we get consensus for an increase or a subset of the community finds the change  compelling enough to do a PoW changing fork to split off.

It's important to note though that deflation doesn't *force* you to find high-reward investments just to see a return.

Not a bad situation by any means; it's what a prospering society looks like.

Not exactly. It is dangerous because it gives an additional incentive to mine, meaning that an attacker is no longer limited by the inherent unprofitability of a 51% attack, since as an interest group they may be able to benefit in other ways from the work. They can gather huge resources and mine at a loss, monetarily, if they have an interest in the other work being performed.
In fact, the more useful the work done by mining, the less secure Bitcoin would become. This basically negates the whole point of PoW, which is that an attacker cannot gain anything without losing much more than they stand to gain.

As an opponent of Core and someone excited by the Chinese rumor, I have to admit that your statements here are correct. A number of people in where I hang out, have this wrong. 
However, let me add some more nuance on the practical relevance:
Indeed, miners alone cannot decide a fork. Miners' ability to exert influence over a fork is exactly the following: a majority of miners can hard fork against the will of the nodes and thereby force the nodes  (including exchanges, businesses, etc.) to themselves hardfork to change the proof-of-work algorithm, because if the nodes don't do this they could be 51% attacked. 
Since changing the PoW algorithm is a big deal and entails a lot of friction, miners have considerable influence to push through a fork, but not at all unlimited (if for instance miners ganged up to double the inflation rate, we'd all be hardforking to switch the PoW method in a jiffy).
It's also important to note that miners would never want to do something like hard fork against the will of the economic majority (investors/hodlers, businesses, exchanges) anyway, as they'd not only be wasting their money, they'd also damage the BTC price and risk having all there mining equipment be rendered useless by a PoW change. 
The only conceivable situation where a miner "revolt" comes up is when miners have a distorted view of what the economic majority wants, especially when the economic minority is substantial. Remember that miners have no special ability to ascertain the will of investors, businesses, exchanges, etc. They know just as much as any of us about it. If they're forced to go by forum posts and polls, reddit votes, and tweets by high-profile pundits and business reps, they could easily get it wrong. 
Hence even if they're pretty sure the economic majority  supports a change, they have incentive to retain a degree of status quo bias since they cannot be sure (and the consequences of forking in error are potentially fatal to their business). 
In summary, miners would usually only fork when they are quite sure they will be mining the chain most valued by the market of infrastructure businesses, hodlers, and other investors. If it came down to it, it is conceivable that they could push through a fork that the economic majority was against, as long as they were only mildly against it (the case where opposition to the fork &lt; friction of changing PoW). The 2MB bump *might* be such a fork, but I think it's clear why miners are not interested in trying to force through a fork via such friction power, unless maybe the user experience situation ends up dire (in which case it is unlikely that the economic majority would remain unswayed anyway).
Therefore, for situations where it comes down to the wire, where it is hard to determine which way the economic majority wants to go, or where the economic minority has a very compelling long-term investment proposition from many miners' point of view and Bitcoin is running into major issues, the ability of miners to ascertain the will of the infrastructure and rest of the market of investors becomes crucial.
Under the system Satoshi originally envisioned, the miners didn't have to wonder about the will of the economic majority, since the economic majority were miners themselves, or had the easy capability to mine. In the event of a controversy, they could vote with their hashpower by mining and building on blocks that followed their preferred ruleset. They could even buy more CPUs to vote more strongly. The orphan risk made it so this system functioned like a prediction market: a user-miner could place their bet on whether blocks following their rules would be accepted, winning extra BTC if they were right (since they'd be mining more blocks as some of the rest of the hashpower would be off mining blocks that would be orphaned - that is, betting wrong in the prediction market), and losing their would-be block reward if they were wrong. 
Thus market information would have been distilled in the block prediction market and miners wouldn't have to wonder about whether a fork would be accepted, except maybe in the most extremely controversial situations. However, mining has since become a highly specialized field, with very few users, infrastructure businesses, hodlers, or other investors mining themselves. Maybe when ASICs commodify and mining becomes ubiquitous again this will be remedied, but in the meantime there is a pressing need to restore *reliable market coommunication*. In other words, miners need reliable information about what changes the economic majority wants and doesn't want, and even how much it cares and how big the minority is on a given issue. 
This can only be done through a *market in changes*, i.e., a market in forks. Fortunately, this kind of single-issue prediction market can be effected by allowing investors to trade fork-futures on the exchanges. Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, etc. can offer options to buy coins in each would-be branch of the fork at a future date (after the scheduled fork). 
Then two sides of the fork then compete on the market, in advance of the actual fork event, until a clear winner emerges (in most cases this should be seconds or maybe minutes). Beautifully, this gives both sides of the debate a chance to win money at the other side's expense, thus restoring a somewhat more friendly relationship between the two sides as "the more suckers who have wrong ideas about how Bitcoin works, the more money I make in futures trading." This put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is dynamic makes the vote far more meaningful. Miners then have the legendary accuracy or a prediction market to guide them, rather than the usual methods of polling the users in various unreliable ways, and can reach a level of certainty suitable for business planning. 
This futures market helps heal the miner/user split and goes a way toward restoring Satoshi's original vision by building a sturdy bridge of market communication between the users/investors/businesses and the miners. Greater controversy requires more accurate market data for the miners to resolve, so eventually it would be ideal to create a decentralized prediction market for forks, but for now simple futures trading is to me the obvious step.

As a staunch Bitcoin maximalist, let me explain: in some sense, "ETC is the un-altcoin." I oppose altcoins precisely because forking away to implement new tech doesn't require starting from a new ledger and scrapping the old one, as ETC shows. Holders can invest and not worry about constantly having to guess right on the next premier coin that will kick ass for a few months or years before falling to another newer one. [That is crucial]( 
Now, if I forget for a moment that Bitcoin is the original ledger and note that Ethereum had a lot of original investment from completely new entrants to the crypto space who bought bitcoins just for that (thus was arguably "the" ledger from those investors' perspective), there is a concept of "Ethereum and altcoins," where again it makes no sense to start a clean slate ledger every time there is a disagreement about the way forward or when a new tech is introduced. ETC/ETH is the first rational "altcoin" from that perspective (not an altcoin in the traditional sense, since it *preserves* the ledger; or rather the pair both preserve the ledger).
That is why I have a grudging respect for ETC, as it follows the principle of "maximalism" (a name I find silly; how about "preservation of investor interest in the world wide ledger"?).

It's another reason NOT to keep the blocksize cap tight, because tight blocksize cap means it's easy for a spammer to clog the network opportunistically and actually steal funds that way due to LN breach clauses. Far from being a way to go against Satoshi's plan by keeping small blocks and letting them get full, LN in fact moves full blocks from a potential annoyance to a serious potential exploit for those who want to steal money from normal Bitcoin users. 
Small blockers took a giant blow today and have yet to realize that LN, the perceived golden liferaft for their economically ignorant ideology, actually doubles down on the need for blocksize cap to be much higher than average tx volume. It turns small blocks from a throttle on growth to a major attack vector. This whole "we know better than Satoshi" thing really isn't working out.
Look how the top comments here are pointing this out and are going completely uncontested. Blockstream has painted itself into the mother of all corners and must be scrambling to figure out how to respond.

I've looked into it a bit since posting the OP, and it seems like for Japan-to-US, once the MtGox and Coinbase accounts are set up it only takes a trip to an ATM, then a few online clicks a few hours later at mtgox.com and then at coinbase.com, then waiting 2-3 days for ACH transfer to clear. However, this may not be killer-app territory except for people that make a lot of wire transfers.
For US-to-developing-countries, I'm guessing the major issue is language barrier. Most bitcoin news is in English. Simply doing a nice specialized video in Spanish showing how easy it is to send money to Mexico, for instance (if it actually is easy), could open the dike.

Stability of an investment that is either going to zero or to the moon in several years is simply not an available option. If you think so, draw a graph of what that "steady moonshoot" looks like. 
To add an elaboration, in attempting to draw such a chart, you will realize two things:
1) It is impossible, because anyone noticing the steady increase will start to anticipate its continuation and people will pile in, causing bubbles and crashes.
2) Even if it somehow were possible, it would be a terrible thing, because then the wealth in Bitcoin would never be distributed very much. The early adopters would just hold, knowing it would just keep rising, selling only when they really needed the money. The rest of the population couldn't get in on it, because if they tried they would drive the price up too quickly, contravening the assumption.

No need to worry, this is natural when you look at the big picture of adoption, and it also helps with network security because it makes miners  more profitable. The big picture is, those who understand the future first make the dough. Sure, many don't understand and are just lucky, but many more don't understand and are unlucky (have dismissed bitcoin).
People will always spend once they reach their dishoarding point. Just imagine your net worth changed by an order of magnitude or two, but it was all in bitcoins. You really think you'd by so sure that Bitcoin will keep going up that you'll not take any profits, either by trading or spending them?

I feel like not many people here really understand reddit culture. Those nerdy, self-deprecating "BITCOIN USERS UNAFFECTED" memes are the best idea so far: they have to be funny and **anti**-pretentious to work on reddit. A series of the best of those memes as an ad campaign could get people talking.
The general idea is that simply giving the benefits doesn't work nearly as well as couching those benefits in humor and un-pretentiousness. Even throwing in a few pure comedy ones that purely make fun of bitcoin users with no mention of benefits would be great, because novel for an ad, and it would keep users checking the ads out for the possibility of more comic gold.

Even if so, since the good guys will always vastly outnumber the bad guys, the higher the average hashing power of any single node the harder an attack becomes. Right now it'd be possible for a large agency to attack the system by spending perhaps a few hundred million dollars to build an ASIC farm. Once ASICs are the norm they'd probably have to spend billions. Coordinating bad guys for a concerted attack also gets harder as the mining network grows, simply because it's harder to coordinate a larger group of people.

The end goal is nice, but starting with all the money in the company's hands and keeping "maybe" 20% (of the net worth of the whole world?!) to pay for their very closed-sounding development with undisclosed employee names and numbers, with the promise that the centralization is just there to kickstart things, after which the centralization will fall away...reminds me how Marx tried to sell Communism. "We need all the power now so that we can give it away equitably to everyone and the state will simply fall away."
It looks like a businessman took a look at Bitcoin's early adoption and decided he wanted a piece of that kind of massive price growth, asking, "How can we turn that into a business?" Well you have to centralize it, but sell it as a system that will "eventually" decentralize. You get other businesses in on it and pay off the bitcoiners to make them happy they have their cut, get prominent bitcoiners to support you and argue for you, maybe even arguing for changes that would help cripple Bitcoin, then you proceed. 
Nice business model; terrible model for open-source spontaneous order. Or if not, worst PR ever. But the very fact that PR is relevant should be a giant red flag that this is primarily about making a profit off the cryptocurrency movement without understanding the fundamentals. What kind of asshole says they're going to have all the control because it's "simpler that way"? 
This looks like some jaded Coca-Cola exec's idea of scooping up the latest trendy grassroots movement and shoehorning it into a business model, set up to secure their bottom line as first priority. "We start off with all the cash because hey, that's just the way it's setup. Nothing we can do about it." 
EDIT: I want to make clear that the concept itself sounds fascinating and very useful, especially as a complement to Bitcoin, but it looks like it was co-opted into a traditional centralized business model.

I could see a cheesy video of this going viral; the "Captain Bitcoin" part really pops in terms of meter, and it's a hilarious image.
@_date: 2013-03-03 16:51:46
Not at all. We are still in the early adopter phase, so just like if you bought a 4K TV there are currently very few things to watch on it, there aren't *necessarily* that many compelling things you can immediately use Bitcoin for, at least for the typical consumer. But there are some quite favorable applications for certain consumers right now, especially consumers of online goods like VPNs (many VPNs explicitly recommend paying in Bitcoin for full privacy), and the list is growing very rapidly. At Bitcoinstore and Bitcoinin there are some deals to be had on a wide range of products, but perhaps not compelling enough yet to go through the trouble of learning about Bitcoin. Overseas remittance stands out as something that is already clearly much cheaper, faster, easier, and more flexible in Bitcoin, especially if the receiver also handles bitcoins. 
However, as the Bitcoin economy expands there will be more and more people for whom it will be worth it to make the switch. Right now I'd say the most compelling reason for everyday people is for investment and wealth-preservation purposes, based on the growth potential. Not being seizeable and having no limits on how much can be sent is a serious, game-changing benefit for high net-worth individuals. Privacy is a serious benefit for others. Global wealth transfer is a serious benefit for those who send money home to their families. Low fees are a serious benefit for merchants (and eventually for consumers).
So as it stands there are certain groups of people for which Bitcoin offers clear-cut benefits that far outweigh the learning curve, and these groups will increase in both size and number as the technology and its surrounding infrastructure matures and adoption by business picks up. Whether you are part of any of those groups right now is a question only you can answer. If not, there is always the investment aspect. If you're interested in none of those things and don't feel comfortable speculating, then you may just want to come back in six months and ask this question again.

From where I stand, even in the absence of any hard-coded limit, I see incentives for miners to limit the blocksizes they will accept, and even to blacklist block-inflaters - even if the inflation would boost their bottom line in the short term. No matter how fast a miner's bandwidth may be, they participate in the network only at the discretion of the other miners.

Awesome! I recommend offering candied yuzu peel as well ([these]( are available at almost any convenience store, though the one at ASNAS stores is by far the best - I think it's [this one]( albeit packaging is not nearly as nice). This is always the biggest hit when I bring candies back from Japan. 
Also the gummy candies are outrageously good, especially [Qun]( - which are sour gummies with concentrated sour fruit juice paste inside, and in my opinion the pinnacle of sour gummy snacking - and just about anything else sour and gummy by Meiji ([果汁グミ]( is another nice, non-sour one). Kanro's Pure sour gummy line is also classic, especially [lemon]( Those fettuccine gummy candies that have shown up recently are also a hit (Sicilian lemon [here]( but boysenberry is best).
Also, where are the original Bakauke? The 250% happy powder DX ones are also good, along with the Camembert cheese ones if still available.
The [Calbee Pizza Ridges]( you have on there are a classic, should be pushed more. 
If you can find the holy grail of all savory snack foods, Takoyaki-tei 2x Size, which are a takoyaki-flavored cheetos-like ball and for some reason taste way better in the 2x size, that would be a must get. I was obsessed with those things for several weeks, and I don't even like takoyaki. Unfortunately I only see the [normal size]( on the website. (Yes, the 2x size really do taste *much* better.)
Also, these [ginger maple candies]( are fucking incredible. The most powerful and delicious ginger hit I've found, and I'm a big ginger connoisseur.
If you take away nothing else from this: candied yuzu peels and Qun. Those two always make a splash and get requested.
EDIT: Forgot about [Bontan Ame]( (those old rice-paper covered soft orange chews that are positively narf-ilicious) and [Suppai-chu]( (bran new sour version of HI-CHEW that I think is way better than the original).
EDIT 2: Also people often want the [myriad Kit Kat flavors]( Japan keeps putting out. For example, they have more than one *type* of strawberry (different strains of strawberry).

I recommend using two separate sources to crosscheck the outputs. You wouldn't want to lose your fortune due to a typo/glitch in the way the program displays the wallet keys. You can use an old Android phone with all mobile data and wi-fi off and sitting in a faraday cage if you're paranoid, perhaps generate a wallet in a Bitcoin app then export the private key and crosscheck it in Bitaddress. Then physically destroy the old phone :)
This seems a lot easier and more secure than booting up a LiveCD or whatever, unless you're prepared to destroy the PC you use.

Albeit ony slightly, it obviates the need for BTC-to-cash exchanges and their fees and delays. If you do a portion of your shopping in BTC, even if it is 2% more expensive, it could still be more efficient than selling BTC for cash when needed.

The notion I'm suggesting is that certainty and stability currently accrue from the actions taken by the consensus of nodes, not - at root - from the devs' protocol restrictions. This is a subtle difference obscured by the fact that most of the actions nodes take, as well as the net effect of their collective behavior, are within the confines of the protocol, presenting the illusion that the protocol is enforcing "the rules" for the system. It is a testament to how well the protocol was thought out that nodes rarely seem to need to act outside of it. Mining pools seem to be one exception where the miners did something to boost security due to a problem that may or may not have been able to be obviated if the protocol were better constructed. The idea is that perhaps Satoshi, et al. just built it so well that the autonomous, self-correcting capabilities of the Bitcoin system have not made themselves very apparent yet, nor in very many cases, but that that is simply because there has been little to correct so far.

In a way, Bitcoins for Pizza* functions as another Mt.Gox, just one that is limited to *selling* BTC. Even though these retail sites often sell products more cheaply and easily because of Bitcoin-enabled efficiencies, even if some of them are a bit more expensive and cumbersome they still may be easier than going through an exchange and dealing with the banking system when you need to offload coins.
If you are a large-scale Bitmit seller, you could probably avoid exchanges entirely in many cases, because then both the buy and sell side would be handled.
It seems that the larger the BTC economy grows, the less prominent of a role exchanges will have, relatively speaking, and that's good because it leaves the system less vulnerable to attack.

You could always cross-check with a second, independent address generator. I'd do this anyway just to make sure there weren't any oddball typos or errors in the way the keys are displayed onscreen.
Ultimately it strikes me that the only safe way to get grandma handling her own bitcoins is to provide her with three independently coded address generators in an air-gapped setting and have her generate brainwallets with the same phrase on all three, manually check that the private keys are identical (annoying but not prohibitive), and carefully transcribe and photograph/polaroid the keys.

Yes. This is a very nuanced issue and there are valid concerns on all sides, but there are inherent limitations to centralization within the market itself that prevent any kind of "death spiral," especially since the issue is out in the open well in advance.
Also, even a relatively small number of market participants are enough to keep prices low. Only collusion by a small group can cause inflated transaction prices, and there would be a tendency to watch out for such practices and blacklist suspected colluders.

You can buy less than a whole bitcoin. I know people who only invested 50 cents. 
A starving man who makes only a dollar a day, and lives on a dollar a day, can invest half his savings (say $10) to buy 0.4 BTC and have that investment grow just as much as anyone. If the price triples, his life savings have doubled, and that would be a big deal for him as he now has 40 days worth of savings instead of only 20. 
Initial wealth is immaterial. What matters in the *percentage* of money you have saved up versus what you need day to day. Investing in Bitcoin, since there are no real limits on the size of the capital, can benefit a poor farmer with a few months' wages saved up far more, relatively, than some rich lawyer who lives exorbitantly paycheck-to-paycheck (of course the downside risks are also more dangerous for poor people).

I say we start with those companies for which the value proposition is highest. While it's nice from an ideological perspective to be able to buy groceries and beer with bitcoins at local merchants, the real competitive edge is in online businesses - even more so ones where privacy is an issue.
No reason to start with the hard, meatspace cases when there are so many low-hanging fruit: online businesses that are foregoing substantial profits by not accepting BTC.

Well my idea is that the restrictions on cheating come - at root - from the nodes (humans, after all, who don't want others cheating). That's part of what I meant when I said the stability of the system derives from consensus and standards, not so much from which rules are pushed from core dev, at least not fundamentally speaking. Anyway I turned that into a main post to get more feedback; I'm very interested in self-regulating systems.

To think that way would be a classic example of missing the forest for the trees. 
First, as others have pointed out, if it is successful enough to constitute any kind of major global energy usage, Bitcoin - through its reduction of corporatism, etc. - will be the biggest boon to the environment since the Internet itself.
Second, the energy is not "wasted" at all; it is used to secure the network. It is certainly way better than gold mining, which is an environmental nightmare, and obviously superior to dealing with printed fiat paper, not to mention all the energy wasted in shuffling it around the globe. 
In essence, your question boils down to, "Is there a more environmentally friendly way of securing the network?" Perhaps, but so far no one has found one that works anywhere near as well as Bitcoin, judging by adoption rates. 
In the big picture, then, if you really care about the environment, whatever cryptocurrency can get us out of corporatism the fastest is far and away the best.

Think in terms of "private key" rather than "wallet." The private key is the only thing that lets you sign transactions so that you can spend the bitcoins in the corresponding address (public key).
Backing up your private key just means writing it down, memorizing it, etc. As long as you generated the private key in a way that you are *sure* no one could have any idea what it is (truly randomly generated and never seen by anyone else), you can be sure you are the sole controller of the bitcoins in the associated address.

I don't understand how so many libertarians could grok Bitcoin yet be more interested in other things. Until Bitcoin came around, being a libertarian had to have been extremely frustrating. The most you could really hope for is slow, grinding progress in raising the sanity waterline of the general public through education. Now, with Bitcoin, the tools for building Libertopia are sitting in everyone's laps just waiting to be used.
I dare say any libertarian who is not excited about Bitcoin hasn't understood it or its implications.

The hoarding effect is inherently self-limiting: everyone has their dehoarding number, where they will take profits for their personal use - perhaps make some luxury purchases using some of their now-giant stack of BTC - once their hoard is large enough.

Nice analysis, probably a bit on the high side due to some people making scads of accounts and addresses, so I feel more comfortable guessing 200,000-400,000 users.

@_date: 2013-02-26 10:52:28
I'm toying with a possible refinement on what Bitcoin (the system) really is, as in the most useful or accurate way to conceptualize it, and I keep coming back to the idea that Bitcoin has a life of its own as a social agreement or standard/convention among nodes, and that although the devs and the main client set the standard right now, they do so only at the pleasure of the nodes. 
That is to say, my sense is that Bitcoin is ultimately the consensus of the nodes, and that the Bitcoin system's stability, coin scarcity, decentralized nature, and all the other things people love it for derive from the social/incentive structure itself. While this structure is affected most clearly by the original protocol and vision and what the devs think and put out, fundamentally I feel like it may be a mistake to attribute the solidity of Bitcoin to these quasi-"top down" rules, and that human convention is really what makes it work. 
For example, what if there were some kind of hard-coded restriction on mine pooling, so that pools couldn't form? That would seem to discourage centralization, but it might have backfired because individual miners would have a harder time hedging their gains in order to stay in business. It seems like pooling was a natural response to this issue that arose, and possibly restricting pooling would have led to many fewer miners and a less secure network.
Now this line of reasoning could be used to support *not* raising the blocksize limit as well, because the nodes/miners would find a way around it. However, I think ultimately if this view is correct, from a big-picture perspective the fewer restrictions the better (because, again, it's not really fundamentally the restrictions that keep things in check but the incentives inherent in the nature of standards). 
A generalization of this view might be that, now that the Bitcoin 'organism' is alive and kicking on its own, "anything suboptimal in the core protocol will be corrected by some workaround arising from the spontaneous order of the nodes," like an organism adapting to suboptimal conditions. 
Of course I can't end this train of thought without finishing what I started: if top-down restrictions aren't fundamentally what restricts nodes to the Bitcoin vision, one must conclude that even the 21M coin limit need not be hard-coded anymore, now that Bitcoin is basically established as a convention/standard. That's taking this logic to its ultimate, scary-sounding conclusion. But my general sense is that no one would dare change it, anyone who tried would face immediate blacklisting and ostracism, and really what is the difference if it's coded into the main client if no one is forced to use it? In short, isn't it this mechanism of the nodes reacting in this way that is the real protector of Bitcoin and ensurer of the foundational soundness of the system? (This is not to say that the limit should be removed, but that it may now be ineffectual.) 
In other words, perhaps the conventional view that "Bitcoinia is a nation of laws, not men" or that the rules from Satoshi, et al. are what make Bitcoin what it is (as opposed to what made it what it was) is putting the cart before the horse. Perhaps Bitcoin - the system - is at its heart just a voluntary consensus among nodes to adhere to certain accounting standards, even though Satoshi's original vision set the standard and the core developers continue to have great pull in the wills of the people behind each node.
While this means the system is ultimately at the whims of the nodes, it has always been so, and merely recognizing this will not make the Bitcoin ecosystem any less stable. In fact if this view is correct, recognizing this may allow devs to "get out of the way" in terms of keeping certain restrictions in the core protocol under the illusion that they are needed, even if they were once necessary before the ecosystem had developed its own organic order.

@_date: 2013-02-16 19:43:04
Some claim, for example, that Litecoin is better because you can mine it quickly on CPU. The idea is that that would make it more decentralized, hence superior to Bitcoin in the decentralization aspect - which is indeed one of the important aspects of a currency. However, I don't know enough about Litecoin to judge, and there may be a resulting trade-off that would make it worse in other ways.
@_date: 2013-02-23 15:43:50
The price bounced against the emotionally touchy 2011 all-time high, when so many early adopters dreamt of Bitcoin taking over the world and them getting rich, and then suddenly it all came crashing down. This has to have been a major psychological event for many people, for some even shaping *who they are*, so when the price approaches $32 those emotions all come flooding back and they lose confidence.
For the same reasons, when we finally do breach $32 the enthusiasm will be that much greater. It'll all pan out in the end as we revert to the major bullish growth curve.
@_date: 2013-02-25 20:13:54
It is true that the scarcity of blockspace is important and that creative workarounds should be preferred to jumping to an increase right away, but there is a bit of sensationalism in comparing it to the 21M coin limit. Both are scarce, but increasing the blocksize is in no way akin to increasing the coin limit in terms of *diluting the value of each coin*. 
This is a rhetorical phrasing I've seen come up a few times, but it has an element of guilt by association, which isn't conducive to clear thinking on the issue.

The thing is, the price of bitcoins is irrelevant for transactions (as long as they clear quickly).

Humans are tribal; words feel like they carry added authority when they subtly reference quasi-united tribal opinion as objective truth, so we are in the (epistemically messy) habit of using objective language to refer to subjective phenomena. 
Turning verbs like "value" into nouns is a great way to hide that equivocation in a tidy semantic package. This maneuver is called the fallacy of reification. Once we refer to the subjective human act of valuation as a noun, we can easily and silently move from "That has value to him, her, and me," to just "That has value." From there it is easy, because of tribal instincts toward universal agreement without acknowledging that tendency, to get confused and start talking about things having "intrinsic value" or "objective value."  Even Ayn Rand fell prey to this.

More specifically, we're growing much faster (2.5 to 3 times faster) than other similar-sized subreddits. There is unfortunately no stat or ranking on Stattit that quantifies this, but you can tell by looking at the last graph on the page.
Percentage growth rate doesn't capture it, because tiny subreddits will always grow fastest percent-wise, and new subscribers doesn't capture it either, because giant subreddits like r/funny will always win there even if they are growing at a tiny percentage rate. If there were a ranking of the fastest-growing subreddits *for their size* that would probably be r/Bitcoin's strongest ranking category, maybe in the top 50. It's a small/medium-sized subreddit growing at the speed of a tiny one.
EDIT: Same for the current activity ranking. r/Bitcoin is  but 90% of those ranked above it are larger than r/Bitcoin. r/Bitcoin would be in the top 50 in activity ranking among all subreddits with 20,000 subscribers or less.
