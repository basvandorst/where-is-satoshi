Well done on not being swayed by FOMO and instead waiting to buy in at a good time.

Am I the only one who noticed how poor their grammar was? In a press release, on an important issue such as this, that is worrying.

Awesome! Shame it's only in the US :P

This kind of positivity and selflessness is amazing to see. There is no way for me to express how grateful I am that there are people like you. Hopefully one day - if crypto doesn't hit rock bottom :P - I will be able to do similar.

If you don't mind me asking, how did you acquire your bitcoins? Mining? Purchased?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:20:53
What an admirable decision! Great job.
I would argue that buying cigarettes was you losing money, so by putting it in BTC you are instead making money - even if BTC hits rock bottom, you will still have more money than you would have had whilst buying cigarettes.

It's hard for me not to dislike Coinbase; support is useless, different staff provide you with different answers. Coinbase is unusable for me, I use other exchanges instead.

I saw the release on nicehash.com, that one has pretty bad grammar.

Market cap is circulating supply x price, NOT total supply. Next, ROI is gain from investment, minus the cost of the investment, over the cost of the investment multiplied by 100: (gain from investment - cost of investment) / cost of investment * 100.

Depends on the person. I wouldn't store more on an exchange than I am willing to lose. You don't want to be holding your whole portfolio on an exchange. So yeah, if you only had 1.5 BTC, 1 BTC would be a lot. Although if you had 40 BTC it wouldn't be much.
Likewise, a hardware wallet is a great buy, although will set you back roughly £60 or $80. Personally, if that cost was &gt;3% of the value of my portfolio I wouldn't bother. Though, that is simply personal preference.

A large decrease in spending/increase in saving would be bad for the economy as a whole. If everyone cut the spending greatly, there would be a massive increase in unemployment.

Time for me to go and create a bunch of failed Coinbase transactions which I can come back to in a year or so :P

Good time to buy some more Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:28:29
I agree with most of the sentiment in this, except that altcoin statement which is incorrect and short sighted.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:36:23
I'm against wasteful spending of course, it's bad for the environment and bad for the general person's bank balance. Although, if everyone started buying only the bare minimum and saved the rest, there would be a large loss in jobs. If people are buying less, business' revenue will fall and they won't be able to afford to keep on all of their staff.
However, I do think the likelihood of people's spending falling massively, in exchange for greater saving, is quite low. People prefer to have things now, they like to treat themselves (this can be seen in the increased use of credit). Also, if amounts of saving were too high, central banks would likely introduce negative interest rates (Japan).

Some countries are already doing it (Morocco).

Most with large amounts of cryptocurrency avoid holding their coins on exchanges (Coinbase, Bittrex, Bitfinex etc). Exchanges hold your private keys, which technically means they own your funds. There is also a history of large exchanges being hacked with customer funds taken. Exchanges like Coinbase differ from banks as your crypto funds are not FDIC (US), FSCS (UK) etc, insured. Although, Coinbase/GDAX do insure US customers' USD deposits.
However, storing your own private keys does have a risk too. If you lose them, your money is gone, if your computer is hacked, chances are your money has been stolen. Hardware wallets (Ledger Nano S) do alleviate these problems to a certain extent. Although, as you mentioned, someone could kidnap you and force you to hand over your private keys (so avoid sharing how much money you have!). And yes, once your BTC is gone, that's it. You won't get it back, you just have to move on. Sucks, I know :(.

Arguably, Bitcoin is becoming more centralised with it's PoW mining system. An increase in the difficulty of problems being solved coupled with the reduced profitably/yield due to this, alongside the development of specialist mining equipment, has forced most miners out. Thus leading to multiple large mining pools, many in China, who have access to cheap mining hardware and low electricity costs.

Because of the users, if everyone was hodling the value would not be increasing. For example, if the first Bitcoin purchase of a pizza had not been made, the value of Bitcoin would not have grown.

I do think Bitcoin is due a correction, it's going up too fast for it's own good right now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:18:07
Not quite true, ethereum is the 'king' for a lot of alt coin trading. The majority of ERC20 tokens really.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:16:35
Got in at under 1k =P

+$10k due to those fat RDN gains today, nice! Maybe diversify a bit more? IOTA? Monero? Lisk? They're making some good gains.

Of course Bitcoin is the main cryptocurrency (or the 'king' as you mentioned) and yes, Ethereum is meant for building DAPPS. What I meant was that Ethereum has become the 'currency' that the majority of these ERC20 alts are pegged against, as that is what they are most often traded with (ETH/ERC20 trading pairs).
As far as centralisation is concerned, Bitcoin is also incredibly centralised with a small amount of mining pools holding &gt;50% mining power. Although, Ethereum does have a planned solution to this: Casper, a hybrid PoW, PoS system. Whereas Bitcoin doesn't.
Btw, I'm a proponent of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, holding both (Bitcoin more so). I don't want it to seem like I'm some Ethereum fan boy that hates Bitcoin =P

He didn't say buy 1 bitcoin at ~$10k, the initial investment of $10k could have been made a year ago, or earlier.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:07:39
Exactly, Bitcoin was the first successful example of a cryptocurrency but it has too many flaws to be the the go-to in the long-term. Ethereum is more likely to be the big player in 5 years.
