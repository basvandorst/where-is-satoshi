I sent bandcamp an email today asking if it'd be possible to accept bitcoin as payment. Hopefully a few other people will do this too, thanks for the suggestion :-)

Very interesting. I don't have any suggestions that haven't been said already but I appreciate the post and all the useful responses. 
This digital landscape is still very new and, as a musician, it's really amazing to see the opportunities being created.
An exciting time to be alive!
Best of luck, OP

A beautiful way to honor the memory of a beautiful human being.

So... what happens to all the cash in the machine?
...it makes sense to me that it would do the reverse as well just to make things easier for the operator.

Excellent! I had no idea this stuff was possible!!! Thanks, mate!

Thanks teckers, excellent analogy.

I feel your frustration, mate.
It's an uphill battle against people's technological ignorance.  After a rant I tend to tell people to research it for themselves - 'cause that's really the only way for them to become informed... but, I'm a musician, so I'm playing with the idea of making some media that explains bitcoin in a more entertaining way... e.g. a "bitcoin rap"

I was at a gig on the weekend and talking to some random dudes, none of us had met before. 
We were chatting about the crappy banking system and they were hypothesizing about how to "take down the banks" when one dude said "oh, I know! We just have to get everyone to withdraw their money!"
I paused and replied "...have you heard of bitcoins?"
They both said "yep."
I'm like "...serious?"
To my surprise not only did they both know about bitcoins, but they had and used them. 
Either that was an unusually cool nerdy crowd or bitcoin is becoming... maybe not "mainstream" but at the very least well known. Maybe a bit of both.
