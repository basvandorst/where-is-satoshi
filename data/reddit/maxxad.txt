Is there routing software to test?

Look at this chart: 
If you have 1/10 of the normal capacity isn't it logical that you get 10x higher fees?

I came here asking a question and got an answer for some other question. And when im trying to be more specific about what i was asking about I'm being dishonest?
I want lightning to work since core pretty much put all our eggs in that basket, but I havent seen any solutions to the problems I see and yet I've red the lightning white paper and every top post of this subreddit for the last couple of years.
Can you be a honest actor and give me a resource that gives a solution to the problems I see?

That article only tells that a prefect network is plausible, not how a client will choose which nodes to connect to and how that client will find the most efficient route to a recipient.
As far as i know there is no algorithm for solving these problems.

I have tested it from Sweden with my visa-card and i got the funds added instantly. I sent the btc's to another wallet and that transaction was verified about 5 minutes later. The amount of cash withdrawn from my bank account was about $2 (15 SEK) more then the amount i got in BTC's.
I am very pleased!

Swede here! I used safello untill circle was opened. 
I switched to circle because my bank account doesn't connect to swish so I had to wait a couple of days for safello to get my money. 
With circle I get my bitcoins almost instantly and so should you if you use safello + swish.

How are we going to unite the community with one side being censored?

What im saying is that if a vendor has only one channel that channel has to be funded from the other side in order for the vedor to be able to recieve funds. That is why I suspect vendors will have to pay hubs in order to get incoming channels. This is a problem for as long as you want to recieve more funds then you send. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:55:12
I wonder how it will work for nodes that wants to recieve more funds then they are sending. They will probably have to pay the other side of the channel in order to set the channel up, am I correct?

Hard to tell. I think the regular monetary system will have to screw up pretty bad for it to completly flip. I have been holding for a couple of years as an insurance against our monetary system. Technically there is no big upside to bitcoin here in Sweden, we have free and instant transfers between most people with the normal banking system. A couple of years ago we talked about helping the unbanked but I guess that is not a thing any more. The only time I actually used bitcoin was when I were buying stuff from the darknet that I wanted to keep secret. I dont know if monero took over that market yet but I bet it will with the stronger technology for anonomity.

If the banking system of today would be set up so that the bank would have to lock up funds in order for a merchant to recieve more funds then they spend im pretty sure the banks would charge a fee for that service.
As a new vendor you will have to have  incomming channel(s) with the amount you want to be able to recieve. I think for someone to set that channel up they will want to have the onchain fee payed and some intrest on the funds that are locked up. Thats ehat i ment with the vendor paying the onchain transaction. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:43:50
If I as a merchant want to get payed in bitcoin over the lightning network I have to open a channel to someone and that someone need to lock up the funds I might recieve.
Am I correct? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:05:52
The concept will clearly work better when everything is done on the lightning network until then its important for onchain transactions to be available
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:28:56
Why would someone set up a channel to a vedor that has no outgoing channels without compensation? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:22:10
I see. Is there a market for outgoing channels yet and at what daily percentage are you charged to get funds locked up for you? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:14:32
If you open a channel to amazon with one bitcoin on your side amazon wont be able to pay you if that is your only channel you. The bi-directional part is that you can send funds both ways but not if the side you want to send from is empty.
I have been intrested in bitcoin since 2011, long before the community divided. I am interested in the technology behind lightning but I dont see it as a replacement for onchain transactions. Thats why I bought 2x tokens before the split. I dont think its wise to put all of your eggs in the lightning basket. If that makes me a concern troll i guess I am one.. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:09:18
I ment if you want someone to open a channel to you just for the purpose of being able to receive payments you will probably have to pay that someone a fee for the funds that is locked up. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:42:19
So a vendor that only wants to recieve funds will probably have to pay someone for an incoming channel, right? 
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:15:39
But if the merchant doesn't have any other channels it's pretty much locking up the funds right?
If i understand it correctly a new merchant will have to pay for the opening of the channel and probably some percentage of the locked up funds in order to just be able to receive funds. To me this must be one of the biggest obsticles to get the network going. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:18:42
I doubt many will take their liquid assets and freeze them in a hot wallet for just 1% yearly return, but I guess we have to wait and see :) 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:40:02
Im saying that a new vendor will need to convince someone to fund a channel towards the vendor. I believe that in reality the vendor will have to pay that someone the onchain fee needed and some other fee for the locked up funds. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:15:50
Isn't it enough that one party doesn't have any channels? 
If a merchant wants to accept lightning transactions the first thing to do would be setting up an incoming channel with a well conected hub. Since this hub will have to lock up funds that can only reach this one merchants node the hub owner will probably charge the merchant for the onchain transaction needed and some percentage of the amount locked up. I doubt people with capital is willing to lock it up without some kind of return. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:28:03
If A is the merchant that wants to be able to receive up to 1 bitcoin the funds on that channel will be 1 at B's side and 0 at A's from the start. That one bitcoin wont make it to anyone else but A until A opens up more outgoing channels. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:57:38
But you wont lock up funds with another node without connections unless they pay you first, right?

I get it now after watching it a second time. I thought the refund was from Bob originally and not the same money that Alice locked from the start.
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:00:13
What keeps Alice from taking the refund money in the end?
