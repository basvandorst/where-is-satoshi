So if I'm understanding you correctly I can generate the code on the wallet app and then scan it on the ATM, when I get back home to my wifi it will then be available on my phone?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:08:30
Nice thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:00:47
Where should I look then for the real price?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:27:32
That sucks. I've been watching some YouTube videos right now and it seems your right. Same shit. I hadn't read anything about Bitcoin for years in the media. Now their all over it again but I figured there was some sort of change for the renewed attention. Until Bitcoin has a secure way to convert Bitcoin into USD then it will never take off.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:11:24
How can I easily check the balance on change tip?
Edit: oh so changtip is gone?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:10:21
I just checked a real old message and found out I have 0.7 USD so it's nothing lol. But I have been out of the game so long I forgot how all this works. How would I take it out and then make it into cash if I wanted to? I remember I got out of it after being ripped off on some dogecoin and that there wasn't really any exchange that was secure. Basically you sold Bitcoin and then a day or 2 later PayPal would refund the buyer screwing you. Is it still like this? Where can someone who is essentially a noob like me that has missed the past couple of years catch up on what's been going on? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:54:21
But so are banks. Regions has a policy of refunding your first overdraft. On the other hand when I was a little less smart I was told a flat out lie by my credit union rep that giving out my routing number to a company wouldn't allow that company to withdraw funds whenever they want. I'll buy into this credit Union hype when the way they are structured is different than a normal bank and isn't based of "the teller gave me a warm feeling in my tummy".
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:51:40
Ahhhh I see. So if I have it right, I fund a bitfloor account and then use that account to buy bit coins via bit floor and they are deposited into a wallet provided to me by them. I will look into cold wallets thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:24:05
I think the issue is that Bitcoin is a commodity and a currency. Its as if we are back to using a store of value as a currency instead of as well ... A Store of value. If you were robbed back in the day there would be insurance (I,d imagine)  for your gold, silver, etc. Idk. Maybe that's a market that can spring up. Bitcoin insurance. You wouldn't get the full amount back but maybe a portion in exchange for a service fee.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:39:41
Damn. Well thank you. You're the polar opposite of the other posters. Appreciate the effort. I actually don't know anything about pools and just figured I'd ask to get some leads on what this was all about. I do appreciate the posts warning me and others not to do it. But as you said I don't like others dictating what I can and can't do. I paid for my tablet and my electricity and if I want to fuck it up I without any doubt can. I won't be though.
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:54:19
Patois is more than english
@_date: 2013-03-19 06:52:14
So what do you use now?
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:30:24
DA NA-ZIIIII'S
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:50:33
I'm not asking if its a good idea.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:15:47
How do you cash out your btc without PayPal?
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:44:59
I thought it was bit cents?
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:23:56
Thanks homie.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:46:27
Nah nigga air it out.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:54:52
So when they show up in your bit floor account you can then move them to a more secure location?
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:03:38
Yea but what did you say? I want you to teach me.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:41:27
It as been going up all well though. What was the reasoning before the hearing?
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:52:38
See I don't understand how that works (writing it onto paper). How does that protect the coin on my comp? It has just dawned on me I don't really even know what a coin looks like. ....kinda bad huh?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:44:29
But if a bit coin was worth 100,000 then how would you buy smaller priced items. Can bit coins be broken down into something like pennies or dimes?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:20:28
Thanks. My amount of btc is small. (.10) I sold of all my coins in may when the price was Around $100. Was kicking myself when it hit $1,000 and then I remembered I had a .10 tip from someone a long time ago. So that's $100 I got. Not as good as the thousand I could have had but thank god for those bitcoin samaratins or I would have nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-30 23:49:40
Lol why would you print it?
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:45:53
Gotcha. What I want to do is transfer my bit coins onto an android device and then transfer to a USB. Total noob. Have no idea what I'm doing. Are they safe in the exchanges wallet for now?
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:49:55
I think you may misunderstand. I don't think anyone thinks that the money is invisible to authorities, Its that there is no middle man for them to put pressure on to take your money while you are unaware. They will physically have to come take them from you and if they do then you probably were up to some shit other than hoarding bit coins.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:06:55
Lol wow just looking at those. How much space does a bit coin take up?
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:04:05
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:08:44
Well I can't say I have that range of experience, but there is a circle jerk about credit unions without ever really going into detail about what the exact benefits are. They will still charge overdrafts, they will still charge fees for no money in the account. I tried applying at one and was told flat out they wouldn't open an account for me because I was planning on spending it within a week ( them never thinking of any future deposits I might make). 
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:14:38
I was thinking of them. Do I Need a BOA account? 
@_date: 2013-06-04 22:35:48
Please.... Leave the departments of Puerto Rico out of this.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:52:43
Understood. I want to take it one step at a time though as this is day one. My android tablet is my primary device. Any resource you could recommend to learn how to successfully transfer bit coins to USB drive via android?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:25:41
No I mean can I just use my bank account?
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:23:10
Hmmm. Non of what you said I am familiar with. Let the YouTubing begin. (Sigh)
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:33:26
Any thoughts on block chain? Is it really dumb to keep it in the exchanges account?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:00:37
Funny I heard of bit coins years ago but got distracted by "life" I've seen them jump $10 in a couple days and don't want to miss out. What is the best place for a noob to buy?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:42:22
People say this but they're really not. I've had the same fees and problems from both.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:56:31
Well what in your mind are the denominations
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:40:27
I'm seriously considering just funding a PayPal account and using their debit card when I need too. Tired of the banks right now. ...and yes I know PayPal fucks people out of money. If google wallet had a way to fund it I would use them exclusively.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:55:39
I emailed them. No response yet. I do see on the order that there is a box saying order timestamp and a time. Is that the time that I will receive the funds. Because it isn't the time the order was placed. Sorry for being a noob. My first time selling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:18:53
Using a tablet and the app seems to work well for other people.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:36:26
Cool thanks
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:11:40
Call the 800 number. They are usually better than the in store people.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:53:58
I appreciate both. Honestly I don't even know what the bit coins I own look like they're just an amount in a wallet. I can't wrap my head around how you can write it on a price of paper and it not being on a computer.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:49:53
This... I did not know.
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:42:35
Yea I was going to go the cash route with bit instant but the amount of middlemen is off putting. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2013-05-05 17:51:00
Couldn't this be solved by someone creating a wallet that showed it rounded down. Or something. Idk. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:10:53
Anyones that pay via Paypal?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:45:42
The same logic could go for banks too. But you're not saying all banks are the shit are you?
@_date: 2013-05-19 00:09:42
Maybe your just gay.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:30:40
That's smart. I'm dead broke right now and am probably going to cash out. I can't see .10 making me millions anytime soon. Although when people said $1,000 by the end of the year I thought it was wishful thinking. Plus I figure I can always buy more later if bitcoin keeps going into the millions or something. Really sucks though.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:09:40
There's a pretty chill shibe on the moon somewhere pissing all over you with much wow.
@_date: 2013-03-19 06:52:39
So who do you use now?
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:49:04
Wow. Bit coin is fucking awesome. Thanks for the best upvote ever.
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:22:47
I don't want them to be tangible. I just don't understand how there is a key as you say and that that secures it. I don't understand what the coin is (even though I own some.)
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:41:31
Wow thanks. Didn't even know you could do this. How do I accept? I clicked accept all and was taken to a send message screen.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:36:49
How long does it usually take for them to send the money to my PayPal?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:38:15
What did you say?
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:11:16
I really don't understand why people insist the government is going to shut down Bitcoin. First off every politician is in someone's pocket but no one ever asks if they want to be? Cutting the banks out might be an unforseen positive to them. As you pointed out the state has more advantage with Bitcoin than other means. I think governments realize this is an evolution and will act accordingly.
@_date: 2013-05-11 18:20:10
What's with all the down votes. Is this site not legit?
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:14:24
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:52:16
Cool. Thanks
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:39:33
How far up do you see it going?
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:01:11
Are these bit coin wallets something that are online/through a service? Or are they programs that encrypt your coins offline? I imagine they could be stored in a folder that's encrypted right?
