Gavin is certainly correct about the "marketing hype"...
Drak, you have to admit, it does borderline on unethical behavior for you to raise $300,000 - $400,000 in the Viacoin crowdsale, and then 1 year later, your main focus is Bitcoin trading...certainly not improving Viacoin and the ClearingHouse technologies.
I participated in your Viacoin crowdsale, and it's rather disappointing that you didn't even give it 1 year of your full effort, energy, and work...
"con-man" is short for confidence-man...he's able to accomplish his schemes **because of** his perceived trustworthiness, NOT _in spite of_ it.

Obviously you didn't read Peter Thiel's "Zero to One"...
You might want to do that _before_ you start making ridiculous proclamations...lol

I couldn't agree more!  It's just sad that it's obvious they're _more_ motivated by their large stakes in bitcoin _than_ seeing a technology be built that could truly help humanity...obviously Bitcion itself was revolutionary (but so was Napster, so was MySpace, so was askJeeves...etc.)

The Ethereum Foundation could _easily_ sell some of its coins to VC's and raise 10's (if not 100's) of millions of dollars...
to the haters - don't forget Vitalik is a Thiel Fellow, and if you don't understand all the implications of that, then sadly, you're just a troll.
to all you trolls who are obviously too stupid, lazy, and unscrupulous to check the ONE piece of evidence in this conversation that truly matters.
Seriously, this thread has been up for over 20 hours now, and no one was smart enough to check the evidence...just more proof to myself that 95+% of ppl online are just mindless trolls who should be _reading/learning and not typing_
