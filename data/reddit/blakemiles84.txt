Wow. I just read this. 
You think that's an insurmountable hurdle for someone with training and access to resources? 
I'd suggest you do your own thought experiments before telling me I don't know what I'm talking about.

The more people come into conflict with their respective governments over fights about bitcoin and taxation, the closer the conflict will move towards a 'one side or the other' approach. Fiat vs Crypto.

I'm fairly certain that making fun of Obama's record at this point is something a majority does. 
Unless you're PC, brah. Microaggressions are 'wack as hell' too.

My guess is the network of miners (particularly the large ones) will necessarily drive the price up as high as they can prior to the halving so that they do not go into the red after the halving. Otherwise, they will take a major hit. 
As a matter of fact, I would guess that this is already occurring in many respects. The price floor of bitcoin could be found at the average cost of electricity necessary to mine at the current difficulty.
If this is true and the numbers bear out, please send me the Nobel Prize in economics via UPS :)

I would hypothesize that the number of LocalBitcoin transactions would correlate as well. 
At first glance, my thoughts were that the market cap is so closely correlated because the global adoption percentage is so low. As the amount of people using bitcoin increases, I would guess the market cap would take on a life of its own outside the constraints of the number of transactions due simply to a greater potential for transaction volume.

"centralize" means a bit different than how you are using it. 
Decentralized pockets of centralized momentum is what makes decentralized networks work. You're turning the term centralization into a straw man.

I think the Chinese are clever enough to find ways around government dictates. 
The Chinese govt. would have to restrict use of the internet on a much broader scale and I don't think the Chinese Government would want the resulting riots that would occur.

text of the declaration:
History may not repeat, but it certainly rhymes. 
When in the Course of human events it becomes apparent that the bands of control and power stem from a universally common source, the necessity of separation from these powers become a matter of survival. 
For as long as the printing press has existed, the whole of civilization has quietly fallen under the influence of sovereign entities with the ability to control the value of expended work through the manipulation and control of currency. The 'sweat off the brow' ceased to be represented by any discernible value, but rather through an unseen, uncontrollable force of entities outside control of the masses exchanging their representative currencies. 
The expenditure of energy by man, machine, and Nature is the sole source of Value. These sources and their result have been devalued through the intentional inflation of printed currencies. Money and currency as understood by the global population are no longer an expression of the collective output of exertion, but rather an arbitrary calculation of unaccountable individuals and organizations that hold them in their influence. Humanity has fallen under the domination of control through Fiat, but this domination has only increased the pressure of humanity seeking a viable escape. 
When entities acquire the power to artificially create Value with the stroke of a pen, bribery and collusion become a trivial matter for those with that power. Those with access to this power naturally develop a bubble of judicial protection, accelerating disparity of wealth. As a result, the Value of Work has been wholly degraded by arbitrary calculations of political expediency. The integrity of Value within all societies has been literally and figuratively forced to the brink of irreconcilability. 
This viable escape has come in the form of provable and irrefutable math through the expenditure of energy -- Bitcoin and its derivative cryptoassets. 
Prior to the proliferation of cryptoassets, the option of the State abdicating control over the supply of currency was never a viable possibility due to threat of forgery, and the costs to secure the integrity of the currencies. The State, and only the State, could secure the integrity of a printed currency through the threat and employment of Force. The maintenance of this integrity is a noble cause and necessary to the stability of a state, because it ensured the exchange of value could be trusted. However, the maintenance of that integrity can, has, and is fundamentally manipulated. 
Whilst the State still maintains a justifiable monopoly on the lawful application of violent force, its monopoly on the control of currency has been demonstrably displaced by the implementation of Bitcoin and its cryptoasset derivatives. 
Where value was once proven by the strength of the State "at the end of a barrel", humans have developed, demonstrated, and proliferated a technology capable of proving value through the expenditure of electricity via the irrevocable proof of math. Such a concept has never been accomplished prior to the initiation of the Bitcoin blockchain. 
As use of cryptocurrencies has spread and adoption rates have grown throughout the world over the past decade, the paradigm of 'value' has shifted in the minds of those who truly grasp the capabilities of this new technology of 'value transfer'. Whereas the Internet changed how humans viewed the transfer of information, cryptoassets are doing the same with the transfer of value. 
We are not declaring Independence from State Controlled Currency -- We are declaring Controlled Currencies through fiat have been rendered Obsolete. 
Our reasons for declaring obsolescence are plentiful. Many deaths and crimes of the previous Century can be traced to unaccountable entities with control of currencies who have gained control of the many levers of power in order to direct the course of Humanity. 
Those who create our currencies have conspired to assume Total Control of the global money supplies, while obfuscating through suppression of media and education the fact that they are capable of conspiracy. 
They embody the systemic risk with the hypocrisy of providing loans to public banks that must provide transparent audits, while avoiding any such audits themselves. 
Their behavior has consistently tipped the scales of potentially Open Markets in favor of providing newly printed currencies to those they trust, as opposed to those the Free Markets trust. 
They have ingratiated themselves through the selective support of lawmakers and regulators whom enact policies that ensure their actions are exposed to minimal risk and maximal gains by diverting consequences on the populations which use their currencies. 
They have degraded the public trust in elected representatives and the equal application of justice by collectively avoiding any accountability for creating systemic risks. 
They have become Cause and Solution to financial crises, to which there is no means of recourse for the rest of Humanity, which bears this burden as a result of Their behaviors. 
This Declaration of Currency Independence is a direct response to the continued manipulation and destruction that stems from the deliberate degradation of Value across the whole of humanity. 
We, the undersigned, will dedicate our lives building networks and systems that restore the Integrity of Value and directly challenge the authority of those who seek to destroy Value.

I don't think 'terrible' is a proper descriptor, especially when there are plenty of 'more terrible' options out there.
Also, how many notarized documents do you know require a precise time of stamp? Not really necessary if you're trying to notarize a letter or something.

SirReal14 - Do you still have access to the raw data? I'd like to play around with some of it and I'm sure some other folks out there could come up with some more interesting analysis as well.
Great work. If you don't get some high scores on this paper, either your prof is a fool, or you're more than ready for the real world :)
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:59:30
Absolutely. And I see those objections as a dangerous conflict of interest given the time and money invested by all stakeholders in the market. Despite this, I think the ecosystem is resilient enough to defend against a problem coming from that. If the market demands something, it will find a way to go around obstructions, particularly in an atomized market like this.
I think there are good things coming from the entire ecosystem, including Blockstream, Core, and Classic. Lots of individuals are contributing. 
The actors behind the stuff I reference are only delaying the inevitable.
Great questions. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:28:05

I agree. All that can be done right now is slowing the giant yacht as it speeds off into the distance
@_date: 2016-02-23 02:54:59
Where did you get the notion that I was trying to argue that an economic majority didn't exist? I see this technique as slowing it down. Killing the idea of digital currencies is impossible at this point, thankfully. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:42:39
Hm. I would argue strongly that the conversation about this topic was a net positive. Keep an eye out for future conversations scratching at the question of whether or not someones intentions are legitimate or trollish. If elements of the ecosystem start to identify, challenge, and isolate this sort of behavior, it is a net gain. 
If the scope of this behavior is minute compared to the scale that I think its operating, the question is whether or not added suspicion/awareness of social engineering attempts is a positive or negative. I would argue that increased suspicion and awareness of these players is a definite positive. 
I would much rather be more prepared for possibilities than assuming and unprepared.
There will be more coming from me and others on the topic. I have plans for different directions as well. The only unique thing I'm passionate about that I bring to the bitcoin community is the unconventional warfare angle. And on that note, anyone operating globally that could be titled a "terrorist" is probably using bitcoin or other digital currencies to finance and conceal activities. I would be if I were them ;)
Along that note, I wrote this a while back and think it adds value: (

Hah thankfully no.

You're presupposing that the idea that cryptocurrencies *could* be killed. I'm viewing it like fire, or the lightbulb, or combustion engines. 
Cat not going back in the bag.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:20:15
If there is a will, there are lots of ways. Pretending like it's not happening seems a waste of energy. 
Much of my research focuses on whats possible and extrapolating from there. If you don't see a value in that given my background, fair enough. Some obviously see a value in it and I will keep writing regardless.
EDIT: Bitcoin is immensely valuable regardless of what malicious or greedy actors do with it.

Think its a possibility that maybe I'm passionate about bitcoin and I'm capable of writing? 
I wouldn't call it "desperate". Perhaps working for an income? :)

The ability to wage unconventional warfare is related to a mindset. 
You're probably right. No active Green Berets are engaged in disrupting open source software experiments. 
Just letting folks know what is in the realm of the possible AND what is in the realm of the likely.

Hah. Expect more of the evidence content in the future. This is a big topic and more research is required. 
Anecdotes aside, do you disagree that there is social engineering taking place to shape the trajectory of bitcoin? 
Don't worry. The government doesn't pay me anymore ;)

Eh.. to be honest, its better knowing that it wasn't stolen. There's always that hope now that I'll stumble across a wallet I forgot about and enter the seed to find the mystical wallet sitting there. Or I'll find out Hashnest fucked up somehow and they'll repay me. But that would require customer service that cares and the ability to speak Chinese, likely. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 06:01:38
The other day I was moving 2.2 BTC out of my Hashnest account to store in my primary wallet. 
The first thing I noticed in the withdrawal field was that I didn't recognize the address at all (you know how you can glance at your wallet and know its yours?). This one was not.
So I change it to my main wallet, intending to follow up immediately and change it from my settings. So I hit send... and slap myself because I forgot to type in the TX pin. Screen resets, type in the 2.2BTC to send and my pin, hit send. 
Oh fuck. The address reset.
I frantically tried to hit the stop button, but no luck. It had already been sent out. 
For the past day I have been searching frantically trying to find wallet seeds that I had lying around, running through all of my browser histories, apps downloaded, and my Authy logins trying to find what fucking account this could have been to. No idea. 
My first concern was that I was hacked, but the damn coin is still sitting in the wallet. Not moved an inch. I have no fucking clue how to get to it. I'm trying to get Hashnest/Bitman to tell me the timestamp and IP address of the default withdrawal address being changed, but the bastards either don't read my message, can't read my message, or refuse to respond with anything coherent. 
Not fun. At All. If anyone knows someone from Hashnest or Bitmain, tell them to get me the damn timestamps so I can at least attempt to do some sleuthing. I want my coin back :(

Just take heart that an American company is doing something in the physical Bitcoin realm. If more people learn about Bitcoin through 21.inc, then it's a net gain. If not, some investors lose some money.
The Chinese mining behemoth can and should be disrupted, however. Getting there is another story.

pretty good breakdown .. but you missed the most important part that it uses QR codes at Walmart... using smart phones and QR codes at POS at the  retail company in the world is good for training users
@_date: 2016-07-05 04:11:25
If you re-read your sentence and question how your use of the word "value" plays out, you should see the flaw in that thinking? 
All "those bitmining megawatts" is confirm, store, lock, and propagate a ledger of value that anyone can read. If you call that "wasted", I would hate to see what other assessments you make on things.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:20:18
Except before proof of work, when we burnt coal or utilized any other form of natural resource to generate energy, that was all it did. 
Now it can be converted into a fungible currency IN ADDITION to everything else it used to do. 
It generates transmittable value that would otherwise not exist in the process of generating electricity.  
"produces nothing of value" is a remarkably subjective statement and the valuation in the markets alone demonstrates that.
