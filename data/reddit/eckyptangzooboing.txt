All these guesses pulled straight from their butts
Absolutely twaddle

I bought for 300euro at 14K, that was dumb in hindsight :|
I'll just hang on to it anyway

A whole bunch of people got filthy rich with domain names. ebitcoin.co.uk does not seem to be worth much. But I noticed you bid $1, which would definitely be a good deal.

GTFO with your spam shit
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:45:47
Are you seriously suggesting rich people to keep $100K in an online wallet rather than buying a $80 hardware wallet?

You have to declare it yourself

Here's the plot for this edition:
"Oom Dagobert is dol op zijn miljoenen munten en bankbiljetten omdat hij daar zo lekker in kan zwemmen. Toch laat hij zijn hele fortuin omzetten in bitcoins (digitale duiten), want zo kan hij nóg rijker worden. Maar daar betaalt hij een hoge prijs voor…"
in English:
"Uncle Dagobert loves his millions of coins and banknotes because he can swim in them so nicely. Yet he lets his entire fortune be converted into bitcoins (digital pennies), because that way he can get even richer. But he pays a high price for that... "

So did he put it all into bitcoin or in paper?
I don't get how he wins his fortune back if he put it all into crypto and can't access it anymore

I love how he tells you when to buy by looking at charts of the past... Oh really, buy just before a breakout? Genius
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:06:17
Solid argument

I know right, why does this have so many votes?
It's based on absolutely nothing, comparing 2 totally unrelated charts over completely different time periods. Rubbish

Today is the decision deadline.
They approved it, it's just not announced yet.

There's 2 things I regret in life:
1) Not buying Google shares when they hit the stock market.
2) Not buying a single Bitcoin in 2013.
