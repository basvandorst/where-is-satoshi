Roman soldiers didn't want to be payed in bags of pepper.
You guys preach how it's not only an investment; you truly care about it as a form of money. If retailers won't accept it as a form of money how can you spend it?
Even if you had some sort of system where your bitcoin wallet had a debit card, thus the retailer never knows you'd still be:
A. Relying on conversion to the dollar/euro etc.
B. Truly wont be able to balance your budget on the fly. Because with bitcoin, whether you like it or not, you have to be an invester at all times. ''Before I swipe for this ice cream cone, let me see if bitcoin can break thru this resistance line.''
And who takes on the conversion fee? The retailer? Not without him accepting it first (growth). 
You? Enjoy paying more than the guy behind you with debit card a debit card.
Growth equals spendability and growth equals a more stable price.
As an investment or a monies; Bitcoin does require growth. 
T Boone Pickens isn't going to tweet tomorrow that hes reevaluated bitcoin and feels its being proactive and cutting costs better than the market shows. No. Bitcoin goes up or down because people want to make money and are increasing their risk tolerance a shit ton because of forum posts talking up bitcoin or you bending your coworkers ear for hours about how great it is.

You didn't/couldn't predict the future. That's like saying I shouldn't have paid for that laptop for school in 2012 with bitcoins, because it would be worth 200k or whatever.
