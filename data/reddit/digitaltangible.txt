We tend to want to "lean in" to the discussion because we serve both sides of the gold and bitcoin markets. Customers use us to trade into gold from bitcoin as well as trade into bitcoin for gold. 
It's our position that smart investors take the strategy that best suits their needs at a particular time. We have a few gold investors that are looking for reasons to liquidate into bitcoins in light of gold weakness against a strong dollar. Thus, we hope we'll encourage more goldbugs and gold investors to consider bitcoin and the freedom to move into into and out of bitcoin as needed.

We're glad to partner with other Bitcoin startups like Melotic to hep onramp more traditional gold buyers into Bitcoin. 
As we bring more gold buyers buy Bitcoin, we expect to contribute to an appreciation in the Bitcoin price movement.
There's about $5.4 Trillion in physical Gold trading each year. We'd like to see more of that move to Bitcoin.

Congratulations to the hard working Factom team. Given their expertise, I expect this will be both a successful sale and a successful software project.

Interesting. This is very helpful. What was hard about trading the 100g bars against bitcoin? We've definitely improved trade time with physical gold since we actually move physical gold for you vs. paper gold so we'd welcome thoughts on the new experience. 
We could definitely do a better job with marketing and raising our messaging. Thanks for this. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:11:36
No worries at all. No, we're not Netagio. 
We're  and we understand the gold/bitcoin trading interface from Netagio. Your customer experience is helpful. I apologize as my answer was irrelevant. 
I'm sure the team from Vaultoro will have an improved and better experience given your feedback above.

Thanks for the response and clarification of the service. Congratulations on the launch as well.

Great choice. ProAurum is a great company. We work with them as well for gold storage for our customers in Europe. 
However, ProAurum doesn't supply gold smaller than 1 Ounce. How can customers purchase fractional gold if your supplier doesn't supply such options.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:39:02
Where's the proof of the actual gold in holding? What type of bars or coins are you trading? What's the quality?
We're glad to allow all our customers to call our depositories and verify all holdings. You can even visit to "inspect" your holdings under your Bitcoin address.
