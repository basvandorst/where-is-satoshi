Alright I'm lost. What's the point of Bitcoin at *all* if it's now being distributed no better than a debit account or cash? I mean, a fucking ATM machine? This is so far from the original values I remember reading here about what people wanted Bitcoin to be.  
  
Now it's just another currency, slowly going to be regulated by the Fed and creeping its way into mainstream cash registers everywhere *near you!*   
  
Seriously I have lost all interest in Bitcoin as a thing now, someone please explain to me why Bitcoin is at all interesting and unique anymore.  
  
From the sidebar:  
 &gt; Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks.  
  
What a load of shit! It's centralized in key websites, it's EXACTLY like dollars (it's always converted into dollar value before purchases in the minds of people), they are GETTING controlled by the Fed (which I think is a good thing, as we've seen with all the illegal drama), And resistant to inflation? [My ass!]( Corrupt banks?[My ass!]( (websites are like the new banks for Bitcoin).  
  
This is a joke now. Unsubscribing..

Basically, HD is rare for free streaming, and torrenting takes time and you have to fish.   
  
If you're broke stick with the torrents, but if you drink higher beer than PBR you can probably afford HD vaginas.
