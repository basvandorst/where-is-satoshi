Your point is correct only if the road network expansion keeps pace with Bus size increase. And it might - I wouldn't even say you're wrong.
However, Bitcoin has always looked primed for explosive growth based on its positive attributes, and I see no evidence of normal nodes exploding in capacity to handle the resultant load (rather, nodes would end up in data centers - see the paragraph above regarding 1 TB blocks)

**Shrink Pods for the Bitcoin Bus**
Extending the ‘Crowded Bus’ Analogy of Bitcoin’s Block Size
The best argument for big blocks is, in my opinion, the Bus Analogy:




[image] The Bus, Full
Let’s say The Bus holds no more than 5 passengers. This is extremely frustrating for us who love riding The Bus because we want more people to also enjoy it.
Some of us are saying “More Decks!”, urging the Bus Makers to upgrade capacity to 10.
[image] Modified for More Decks
 
Instead, most Bus Makers are installing racks of unusual seats. This seemingly elaborate upgrade probably only increases capacity to 8.
However, the true benefit of the new seats is that they also fit **Shrink Pods**. Exactly the forms these Pods will take is still being determined, but the spoon-shaped seats are there to accommodate them when they’re ready.
Each Pod will shrink a crowd of passengers into the space of a single seat, to be carried and delivered to their destination in the same condition as regular passengers.
[image] Modified for Shrink Pods
 
In contrast, the “More Decks” strategy expands the bus only for regular passengers - and hinders installation of Pod seats. With each new regular seat, passenger numbers would increase at a linear rate, while the comparative advantage of using The Bus diminishes.




Before The Bus becomes more cumbersome than a cruise ship, we would all cry out for Shrink Pods. But would The Bus still be receptive to that upgrade, or did we miss the opportunity?
Right now, Bus Makers can add the Pod seats and only a few disgruntled pedestrians will protest. But if the bus has 100 seats, still no Shrink Pods, and has once again reached capacity, I expect Bus Makers will choose to add yet another deck for regular passengers. Their alternative is to anger throngs of important (stability-minded) passengers while they retrofit Pods onto the increasingly colossal Bus.
[image] Bitcoin’s Scaling Future
Shrink Pods - Segwit, Lightning, Sidechains, and other Layer 2 Solutions - are rightly a top priority for most Bus Makers. Importantly, Pods will have a multiplier effect; When The Bus expands, as it probably must, each new seat could hold a crowd.
Then everybody gets a ride.
@_date: 2016-11-21 16:12:52
Would this go in the end section? Like "Looking forward, we shouldn't be worried about *if* the bus can add seats. When everyone agrees to do so, it will happen easily."

If I could make a suggestion: I like the way bc.i (and surely others) shows the stream of blocks being added to the chain. 
I'd like to see blocks stack in similar fashion (with its block number) and next to the block, the block reward amount. I think something like that would have a great impact if you've been seeing **25** next to a grounded rocket for a few minutes and then the action

I disagree. The danger posed by 2X cartel and Blockstream are not remotely the same.

Also worth pointing out that the hundreds of Core devs are not centralized, and are [welcoming of new developers]( Blockstream (the target of most 2X propaganda) is only about 1/4 of the Core commits. The tired argument that they are synonomous with Core has been [thoroughly dismantled](

I think it's just a shorthand for smoother discourse. Otherwise there would be arguments about what the likely average size would be in both cases, how **weight** should figure into it, what counts as being "in the block", etc.
You're right, though, that the increased centralization from 2x is understated by thinking in terms of a 1MB bump.

From my vantage point, Core implementing 2x block size is politically expedient, as it prevents an outside force from taking the Bitcoin mantle from Core. That's where I agree with Erik - it *seems* like the right way to proceed.

It's more like some shady startup took the recipe for Sprite, replaced a preservative for some carcinogen.
They also worked out a deal with grocery stores, gas stations - basically wherever most people get their Sprite - to where their nasty version would be labeled exactly the same and would be swapped in to replace the old recipe.
Of course, manufacturers of the Sprite I like (Core) hate the turn of events as much as I do, but most customers won't notice the difference.
I don't want to drink that and I don't want to see it replace the old Sprite at every merchant. It's not *forced*, but it's treacherous.

^ This
Astounding how many people think this tweet is a dig at their business models.
The problem is not off-chain transfers, exchanges, or payment processing. The problem is that these companies want to do that stuff on *something other than Bitcoin* - inviting the chaos of transaction replays among different blockchains.
The 2x (btc1) fork is a small, controlled development team rather than the widely distributed team we've got with core (only 20% of core is in Blockstream, which - by the way - was specifically formed by core developers to grant themselves autonomy). 
If the miners and exchanges get to modify the protocol at will, in defiance of user desires, *that's* the centralization problem.

Core is only in control of Core's software. The market - by far - holds their implemented protocol as the true Bitcoin.
If Core implemented 2x, the choice* for the market is then Core's 2x vs BTC1's 2x. Miners and Exchanges choosing BTC1 at that point would showcase the actual intent of S2X: Ousting the motley crew of Core and replacing them with easily controllable assets. The bad PR could be enough to dissuade them from that action.
So then the world moves to Core's 2x. In that sense, Core is "in control" of the software, and the users / market remain in control of Bitcoin.
Honestly, though: The vast majority of devs think 2x is a bad idea on a technical level. For them to betray the technical merit of Bitcoin to appease political opponents is a bad idea...
*We'll ignore the existing Core (1x) version. It's a moot discussion at this point, but I doubt many would stick with 1x if Core officially went to bigger blocks.

I have a feeling you created that account just to stir up conversation about China's knockoff coin, but I'll bite..
The feature separating Bitcoin from something like US dollars or World of Warcraft gold is that it's decentralized. BCH is much more centralized. 
Bitcoin is useful because of its tech, and BCH is technologically inferior.
- Much larger blocks reduces the set of individuals that can run a node, due mostly to bandwidth constraints. This is good for miners, because they have the $60,000+ for a few nodes, which means they can dictate changes to BCH without pushback from the network. That's the peril of centralization. (
- On Bitcoin, Segwit and Layer 2 (e.g. Lightning) are solving this problem, but BCH has rejected this solution, and so BCH scalability will be much (~10000x) worse. (
- ASICBOOST provides an advantage to Bitmain and is the most rational explanation for why they would rather support a technical dud over actual Bitcoin: It makes them more money. ( 
- Segwit is often touted as a scaling solution (it enables *major* scaling) or a blocksize increase (allows about 70% more transactions per block), but it also fixes transaction malleability. ( Ironically, the attack Segwit prevents was a problem for BCH
 immediately after it launched. (
- BCH is supported by a mining cartel in money and mining power. It's written by devs that worked on prior (failed) Bitcoin usurper projects, which were sponsored by - you guessed it - the same mining cartel. 
 ( Their interests don't necessarily align with that of the users.
- The BCH crowd is also pushing for "Emergent Consensus", which basically enables miners to modify rules whenever they want. That alone should cause centralization warning alarms to ring. Mining centralization is bad enough (power to make coins and authenticate the network concentrated in too few hands) but power over the network rules compounds the problem. For example, if the people who have total control over the rules are the ones who receive newly generated coins, why should they maintain a 21M money supply cap? ( (Bonus: that article mentions earlier coup attempts, similar to the BCH and 2x stuff)
I've put down some of the ideas that get discussed regularly here on the bitcoin subreddit. If you are just an anti-Bitcoin shill, perhaps you'd have better luck calling Lightning "vaporware" - You'll probably get another month or two of FUD out of that. (

2MB blocks seem fine to me. I agree with what has been saying: Bitcoin Core implementing 2MB blocks seems like the right way forward.
That is because on the spectrum of "Slow and Methodical" engineers and "Fail Fast and Adjust" engineers I fall toward the latter end.
This self-knowledge has helped in my career and grants some perspective on the block debate. I've worked with people like Adam Back (frustratingly thoughtful and meticulous) and recognize the value in having them serve as filters; They sift through complexity, identifying and defusing landmines. That's exactly what Core demonstrated with their [Scaling Plan in 2015]( The plan laid the groundwork for massive (Layer 2) scaling as well as block size increases.
We point to the chorus of developers shouting **NO2X** because it represents the technical viewpoint of a technical issue.
But NYA is not just a compromise on a technical level, it is an attempt at compromising the development path - toward authoritarianism and away from decentralized value creation.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:47:25
Yes, Core released their roadmap two years ago, which allows for bigger blocks. The plan was to implement foundation for exponential scaling first (segwit), and then continuously evaluate the block size parameter.
It makes sense to evaluate block size parameter once exponential scaling offered by Segwit is widely implemented. Otherwise, we weigh increased centralization against small jumps in transaction throughput.
