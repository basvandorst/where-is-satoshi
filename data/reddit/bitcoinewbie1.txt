he owns bitcoin.com, yet never stops complaining about censorship on a subreddit. Not even all of reddit just a subreddit
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:16:54
what did you get banned for? I thought they were supposed to be anti-censorship
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:23:49
are you sure? maybe he invented a new term, like hodl

i'm really getting sick of these old parasitic goons that are trying to stifle innovation to keep their sick parasitic tentacles alive

why does savings imply "investing in money"? the point of having savings is to have a comfortable buffer when you're out of work or retired

We have enough shopping malls already. I'm tired of believing this bullshit that we have to constantly work ourselves to death to make more useless shit even when we have a surplus of useless shit.
It doesn't have to be the end of the world when someone is temporarily out of a job because the work doesn't need to be done.   We've just accepted that it has to be that way because most of the money we do earn is plundered from us, and we are given just enough scraps to keep our heads above water.

do you really need to fud him with this? pulling out your initial investment is a great strategy imo and actually helps prevent you from panic selling
not everyone has been in this as long as you and has a heart of iron

Haha, lookie here, he's claiming to be both groupthink and skeptic at the same time
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:13:54
But isn't the relationship between the number of transactions and demand a bit more complicated?
More demand means more transactions, but then more transactions means higher fees, which makes people less willing to do more transactions
the relationship between # of transactions and actual demand for the network then seems a bit complicated to me

Uh, what the fuck is he even saying here? Go all in and trust the federal reserve?

Whats the most crypto friendly bank?

Because some of us want to escape our wage slavery for employers that flaunt their power and dominance in our face
maybe you are independently wealthy and/or enjoy your job, for some of us that is not the case, we don't have the luxury of being hippies

is this the legitimate Trezor site?
Also, do I have to buy the Trezor hardware? If so, is there a solution that I can first just do on my computer?
Edit: I think I'm going to give bitcoin core a try: 
So I'm synchronizing with the network, which I assume means I'm downloading the blockchain onto my computer
One question I have, let's say I transfer my bitcoins to my computer via Bitcoin Core, and the blockchain grows to a size that my hard-drive can no longer handle (like 500 gigs or something), what happens? Will I not be able to transfer my coins out of my computer anymore because it is unable to sync with the network? Hopefully I'm misunderstanding something here
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:24:50
Cool thanks, electrum seems pretty good until I get the hardware wallet setup
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:40:00
While we're on the subject, it's this right?
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:24:57
Fair enough, understood
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:35:13
you know I can't help but just feel a little nervous about a supposedly decentralized coin, when you say huge longterm gains depend on the actions of one man =/
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:35:52
What if the developers stop working on the project and nobody picks it back up? Is this a highly unlikely event?
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:27:21
right, that's sortof what I was getting at. I should have worded my question a bit differently. What I meant was, I will still with the current version of electrum always be able to legitimately export private keys, which can then be used to access my bitcoins on something else that is more up to date, right?
Reason is just thinking down the line what if electrum stops updating, etc. Would be nice to know that I can always have a version of electrum stored somewhere that I can always use to generate my private keys from the seed, even if electrum stops updating its software

haha, now i understand the "Give Edge a chance" popup XD
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:56:09
Thank you all for the great responses!

It was rough, I feel like I built up an iron stomach for 30% drops, but not 75%, it's hard to see what you know represents a lot of slave labor fly out in the window in such a short time
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:26:11
actually everything that is done on the stock market can be done with cryptos, but better
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:17:06
What happens when a person buys another investment (say, precious metals) with bitcoin? can losses there be deducted?
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:30:51
a crypto is basically a database governed by a protocol, and once the network is up and running it's very difficult (if not impossible) for anyone to corrupt the data, because the information they broadcast to the network will break the rules of the protocol and it will be rejected
this means that we no longer need middlemen to manage databases
banking is just one institution with accounting data that relies on middlemen, the stock market is another one, and plenty of others
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:47:35
^ what this guy said =D
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:22:00
thats why i sell in many small amounts, and i would just stop using that exchange if it stopped working and eat the loss
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:35:36
From wikipedia:


^ That's called a centralized database, a massive computing infrastructure managed by middlemen
No idea what point you're trying to make
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:21:03


I agree
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:35:54
for a system designed to keep us in debt, it would be counter intuitive for them to teach us how to manage our finances, remember your patriotic duty is not to balance your checkbook but to go shopping
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:39:55
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:28:59
i dont think its all bad, but it does mean that for the long-term bitcoin is more of a store of value, and may not be practical as a payment mechanism for low cost goods/services
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:08:35
Damn, was worth a try. I trust that you're right, but can you elaborate a bit? I am basically going off this article,  where they say "Like-kind is broad":
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:34:54
This, would be interested to hear a response from theymos
To me, the only way you can get to that "less than a few million dollars" statement is by arguing that it is overvalued, not giving a lecture on the circulating vs total supply
he does seem to be implying both, but the language strongly suggests that the "less than a few million dollars" is a direct result of the circulating vs total supply argument, which doesn't make any sense
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:36:58
Right, but it does mean that those individuals who called all other alts "shitcoins" were essentially incorrect :)
@_date: 2017-05-30 02:10:26
Understood, thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:06:08
the fee may not depend on the value of bitcoin, but the dollar value you lose to fees is greater if the price is higher
for example, lets say the average fee was 0.0002, if bitcoin was only worth $1, I could buy something that costs 5 dollars with bitcoin, and the fee would be negligible
but now, if I want to buy something worth 5 dollars with bitcoin, its going to cost me 40 cents just in fees, raising the price to 5.40
if it eventually becomes worth say $10,000 or $20,000 like some people are predicting, for that 5 dollar purchase I will also be paying possibly 5 dollars worth of fees to do it!
am i misunderstanding something here?
