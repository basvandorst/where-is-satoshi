I would vote for you as world president - you have beautifully summed up the truth about government and how unfit for purpose they are. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 10:31:58
The reason Bitcoin is the biggest revolution since the invention of the wheel is that it will get rid of tax - which is just theft - started by false kings and queens and continued by corrupt governments. Bitcoin will remove centralised govt from this planet. Governments are no longer fit for purpose. Goodbye tax - hello BTC. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 14:36:02
I am. I am building a Bitcoin POS transaction system which will enable the 5 billion unbanked to use Bitcoin and buy and sell goods and services without any cost.
It will also be a tool that enables mainstream adoption of bitcoin and is a direct replacement for the entire world financial system. Be ready in 2015.
@_date: 2014-10-29 11:56:09
Tax is Theft - Bitcoin will end the policy of a few people raping humanity for whatever reason they feel. Governments die without the ability to steal money from its citizens and not before time. Bitcoin will change the planet in ways you can not imagine today.

The purpose of altcoins is mind blowing. You have to do about 6 months work in altcoins to get the revelation of their purpose. You think Bitcoin is big? Altcoins are going to be even bigger. Here is a hint for anyone truly seeking an answer. Altcoins are to Bitcoin what domain names are to the internet. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 16:21:57
Die - they are no longer fit for purpose - do not serve humanity and will be dethroned over time like the banksters. Tax is THEFT.
This is a beautiful "sidechain" effect of Bitcoin and why it will be looked back in history as the largest revolution to ever take place on planet earth.
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:03:38
Ending the evil of taxation will become one of Bitcoins great achievements. Tax is slavery - Bitcoin is freedom.
@_date: 2014-12-02 09:48:25
You can smell the fear they are starting to feel about Bitcoin. This fear is going to get worse and worse for them. Soon they will be loosing not only their income but their jobs and not before time. The revolution has started and will continue until Mastercard, Visa etc.. do not EXIST. The worlds largest and most peaceful revolution on earth is starting to felt by the evil in the world.
@_date: 2014-10-30 08:09:59
When is humanity going to wake up to these evil thieving crooks ??? Do you not realise you are being raped every day by these people and all they have to do is pay a little bit back that they stole. This is why Bitcoin will succeed. When the humans wake up they will run to it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:26:21
Truth should be the way forward on this. Bitcoin by design will eradicate most of the functions of government. Especially anything the government manages is something that Bitcoin will do better.
No-one tells these crooks the truth. Their days are numbered - It doesn't matter what they say or do - Bitcoin could not care less what rules are in place - It has its own rules and eliminates the need for government intervention. This is what the government needs to know. Not the current bullshit of false cooperation.
Governments can only steal and make people dependant. Bitcoin liberates, government enslaves. Using Bitcoin means governments will no longer be able to enforce their stealing through tax.

The whole point of Bitcoin is to get rid of banks. Don't be upset that they wont play ball. Every Bitcoin is a silver crucifix to this evil group. Just follow the BTC as much as you can is that is what will slowly but surely remove this disease from the planet.

Excellent observation on the future effects of Bitcoin. This is what people dont yet understand. Bitcoin WILL eradicate the disease of government by eliminating their ability to steal/tax us. This is the real revolution of Bitcoin - the complete destruction of ALL government who are no longer fit for purpose. Of course most humans think they can't live without daddy government, but the reverse is true - we will thrive.

Bitcoin is THE ultimate tool that will eradicate taxation and the disease of government which is so corrupt that it is of no benefit to those it is meant to serve. We do not need to fight with government - we just need to become like the blockchain - free and transparent - that is our future - not big daddy.

Calling me names shows that you have no response that would help anyone reading your words. Your words are of no benefit to anyone. I only speak truth, so of course you just call me a name. You will see in the future that what I have said is not so delusional, and is directed to the audience that I am addressing, which are generally Bitcoin supporters. Bitcoin is a revolution - not a get rich scheme.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:56:03
The disease of bankers is finally over. Bitcoins growth is going to be huge and these pointless thieving crooks will no longer exist. This is a FACT from the future.
@_date: 2014-11-20 12:48:49
Don't worry in a few years Bitcoin will deny these arsewipes of funds due to the worldwide adoption of Bitcoin and people not paying any further taxes to them.
I know no-one believes that - but people used to say the same about the Internet back in the 90's. No-one believed me when I told them that in the future they would be able to buy their shopping from tescos online.
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:05:00
You may think that your masters are all powerful and you have no power. But you are wrong. We can win, we will win, because we will not stop until we do. Your support is crucial, and your doubt gives fuel to the thieving crooks that rule this planet. We will see it in our lifetime. In fact  within the next few years. Have a bit of faith.
@_date: 2014-12-29 19:11:40
As usual missing the whole point of Bitcoin by anal izing. Bitcoin is a revolution and has nothing to do with kwhours, miners, price of fish fingers. Its going to completely transform this planet even more than the Internet did. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 10:53:44
I also have been around since 2010 am a merchant and building bitcoin technology. I believe that in the near future when BTC is mainstream once the payment hits the blockchain it will be considered as PAID. Why, because we will have a long history of seeing that double spends are virtually non existent. Compared to the evil of chargebacks Bitcoin is heaven.
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:17:28

You are spot on sir. Bitcoin will be known as THE largest revolution in the history of mankind. Bitcoin will end bankers, government, end wars and poverty. Bitcoin will replace ALL money on Earth. For the first time EVER we will have money used for the benefit of the people. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 08:31:18
Nicely said. I have been a retailer for over 15 years online. The banks are not only thieves but the creators of fraud with their systems. The true revolution of Bitcoin is the complete destruction of existing banking systems. There is an app in development that will allow retailers and buyers the ability to effortlessly transact without bankers. Bitcoin IS a bankers guillotine. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:50:38
Chargebacks are the merchants having to pay for bank fraud. It is pure theft by bankers and a major reason for eradicating the spawn of bankers on this planet.

Alt coins are NOT competitors to Bitcoin. They never have been and never will. They have an entirely different purpose than what we see today. Just to give you a clue - Most businesses in the future will have their own coin - you will have to use your intuition to find out the reason why.

The long term effect of Bitcoin in society is the removal of government from our lives, as they are no longer serving us. This is Bitcoin the Revolution and governments only exist by forcing us to pay tax. That's gonna go first. Tax must be seen for what it is - THEFT.

@_date: 2015-03-01 09:32:33
None of the above - Bitcoin will do for money what the Internet did for communication. Bitcoin is a revolution against people who think things should stay the way they are because it has always been that way.

Bitcoin is not an experiment as the uninformed believe, it is a REPLACEMENT to the existing financial system.

Marijuana is better for you than meths. I am mid 50's and have more Bitcoins than most, due to the fact I have a better understanding around it, and its purpose than you.
Bitcoin was created out of the idea that banks and government are no longer fit for purpose. Bitcoin will eradicate both groups over a period of time. Whats ridiculous to you, is a fact to me. I could give you a lot more reasons but you will only call me names, because your understanding of the subject is so limited.

When the planet takes on Bitcoin it eliminates the idea of taxation. Tax is theft and no longer needed. You need to realise that no-one has the right to steal your money. So this is why Bitcoin will end the situation where we all work for a government, and why it is the biggest revolution since the wheel.

The criminals that run this planet at the moment don't want you near bitcoin as it WILL end their reign on earth. You have to take the attitude at this stage, that you are a warrior fighting the existing system and that its not easy. Once you pass through the grief you are experiencing and start working with Bitcoin you will understand my meaning. Keep persisting and you will get there. It will be worth it and you and the world will reap the benefits. We need traders in the Bitcoin eco system, please keep your head up.

As you only see Bitcoin as a tool to make a quick buck, it is correct that you leave as you missed the point completely.

You are just expressing the fear that bankers and government feel when they realise Bitcoin is the revolution that ends their way of running this planet. That is why Bitcoin is the biggest revolution on planet earth. Bitcoin is designed to end the reign of Rothschild in a peaceful way. We understand your fear of going up against the big boys, but Bitcoin is David.

Bitcoin is the future of ALL money. People will start transacting more and more in Bitcoin and will realise the benefits like those of us who have been around if for a few years. Basically Bitcoin will be the currency of preference. Bitcoin ends the need for paper money, its just that the world has not caught up with that FACT from the future.

Tax is THEFT - Bitcoin will end the idea that a small group of people can financially rape humanity without consequence. Bitcoin is the end of tax and why we are at the beginning of a world revolution that will end the slavery model that we all live under. Thats the real point of Bitcoin - Its freedom from the existing system.

Bitcoin is the biggest revolution in planetary history since the wheel, yet nobody knows that yet. The point of Bitcoin is nothing to do with the price. Bitcoin has been designed to remove bankers from the money chain and remove government who can only rape or create dependents amongst its population. Both groups are unfit for purpose and WILL be no longer needed in a post Bitcoin economy. I am aware that nobody will agree with this post, yet it will happen.

Bitcoin is designed to eradicate the evil of taxation, started by false kings and queens.
