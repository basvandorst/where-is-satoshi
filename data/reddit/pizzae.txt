But is there a guarantee for resiliency specifically in crypto or better yet bitcoin? This is sort of like natural selection, but even then, it's not possible to always get stronger and survive because circumstances or stronger external powers can prevent an organism or a species from surviving. Kind of like how even though there is a constant evolution in chimpanzees these days, humans have the capability to decide their fate because we are simply much more powerful.

Definitely, technology will not improve. We will never see IOT, Cloud and VR go mainstream, no. We will forever stay with the current technology that we have for the next 100 years (if we can even last that long).

But how can you explain the high gas fees of bitcoin? I've seen examples where you have to pay dollars worth in gas, for small transfers of a few dollars. A $1 beer becomes $10 total, with a long verification time. How does bitcoin address the ability to handle smaller transactions?

Then would Bitcoin somehow solve these NP Complete programs in P time? What is the alternative to ethereum, and how is bitcoin any better off considering that they both have scaling issues?

Thanks for taking the time to answer. I'm wondering if the upcoming change on August 1 (segwit?) is the change that benefits the miners, or the users? I've heard that the miners want to do some other change to ensure they make more money, whereas the other change/fork is for the best of bitcoin
