Lol where did you pull that stat from? Out your ass. %100 not true 
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:18:28
You have proof on those stats? 
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:26:45
Do you know how the market works? There is always a correction after a rise. Just how it is. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:19:44
What makes you think its crashing? Its called a correction.... Especially after the bullish 10 months we just had. Your spreading fud.... This is normal, look at bitcoin for example, still correcting from the pump this year. What goes up must go down my friend. Just hodl!

Iv been taking the bus. Saving all the money i can for my first opportunity to buy some Bitcoin. ������
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:20:58
Believe in yourself, tell yourself you can do it abd go get it. Be driven to succeed. And own digital assets.... Lol 
@_date: 2019-02-10 23:56:13
Bitcoin is just an example of what this space can offer, it is an eye opener to the possiblity of tremendous gains for early adopters. There is alot of opertunity .... And realistic is a personal preference, whats un realistic to you may not be for others. But i do understand what your saying. Just live life with a positive attitude, good things will happen. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:44:17
Then how did you type this? 0_o
@_date: 2019-02-24 11:49:40
Ummmm if i was to make an educated guess i would conclude it it be fake? Lol 
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:54:24
Fucccckkkk wouldn't that be a dream lol
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:19:38
Why would you insinuate i ride the bus? I make 100k + annually. So you can get fucked. And i said it as a joke, no need for your pessimistic negative views. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:29:43
I live in Canada and bank at td. I have not had an issue with making crypto payments. Have not tried withdrawals.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:32:09
This guy is posting his opinion and proof to back it up, why do you have to be so negative and a hater. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 16:05:12
Is that what that 300$ push was lol? Naaa that was not a bull. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:13:15
Your right, alot of Alts are scams. But i believe that there will be Alts that will be market shakers. There is a big issue with pow. Is it sustainable? Hmmmm.... The crazy times we live in. The fight for block chain dominance.
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:24:55
I think the underlining issue hear is to know when to take profits and when to hold. The truck to success. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:52:30
What's the fees like? How do you go about tax's?
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:52:21
I hope so lol
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:41:32
This is the reason i hodl. Better days to come! 
@_date: 2019-02-23 11:31:18
Fuck i hope so lol i need that cheep BTC. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:40:54
Well with a negative vibe and a pessimistic outlook on things id say your not going to far in life, may be unattainable for you but for some its completely possible. I can %100 tell you i will own a car like that, if not better. Dont set limits to what you can do. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:27:42
What bank?
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:05:19
Ouuuu look at you mr big words. Means you must know so much.... You can keep your pompous ass narrow minded opinion. You will be the one left behind. Have you seen bitcoin? The king of pump and dump. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:40:17
Clearly very ill informed and haven't done much research then.... You realise that blockchain and digital assets is a space? Not just bitcoin. There are lots of projects that are very promising. Lots of digital assets that will be worth lots in the future. Don't be so narrow minded. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:19:04
That hair tho!! ����
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:34:42
Sounds like your a bitcoin maxi lol chill, they pose a valid point. The energy Consumption of btc is not sustainable. We all know that, something will need to dramatically change, or country's like China will ban it.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:31:15
That all ya got?
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:24:59

Shovel snow, cut grass, paper route ? Sell your kidney? Youll thank yourself in the long run lol
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:04:16
In 100 years from now we will all be dead not looking back at our bitcoin investments lol 
@_date: 2019-01-26 11:50:59
You realise no one cares about you or how big your portfolio is..... Good for you dude, give yourself a big fucking high five. People invest in crypto because it is revolutionary, internet 2.0, evolutionary next step for humanity. If you say you've done your TA and know for a certain this space is dead ( which its not ) why proceed to tell people who invest in it that they are all idiots. You sir are a sorry excuse for a human, i feel bad for you. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:24:30
I have no issue with the platform, i have an issue with the online management. Why are you so but hurt over my opinion if your pro free speech? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 21:07:19
Down vote for a joke? I dont see you giving the kid ideas. Your a joke.
@_date: 2019-01-30 20:53:40
I feel you dude, i was where you are when the internet came to be. I always told myself i wouldn't miss the next one. Maybe get your parents to help you buy it?.... Or wait till your old enough to invest. You will have lots of opportunity in your generation. Enjoy being a kid.

@_date: 2019-01-08 11:40:10
And why would i do that? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:17:04
The unprofessional image that Gab gives off on Twitter. I would not recommend anyone. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 19:32:19
What am i looking at exactly ? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:41:59
Good one.... Thanks for your two cents tho. I could really give a fuck what you think. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:20:29
This has to be the biggest piece of shit article iv read all year. Vary ill informed and calling all coins shitcoins. Don't waste your time. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 01:05:54

@_date: 2019-01-08 11:39:20

@_date: 2019-01-26 20:10:06

@_date: 2019-01-13 21:19:52
Clearly haven't learned much then. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 14:04:01
Cant have another blood bath if we are still in one. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:35:19
Well i guess the real question is .... Was that your password and were you chuching it? 
Crying while masturbating and using your tears as lubricant. Also called ''chuching it'' or ''chuchin' it''.  
If so.... Send the bitcoin lol. 
Best of luck.

You guys ever think that's why XRP has such a high cap? Just thoughts
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:16:23
Lmfao if you don't have the balls to play this game then GTFO. 
You sound like you put in more then you could afford to lose. 
That's your problem bud. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:39:44
Just asking for opinions on the current situation our world is living threw? 
Don't be as childing as to shun a name. 
Grow up and go home, maybe put your big boy pants on to. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:06:16
You dont think they know about the success crypto will bring? They are not stupid people, that already have there hands in. More then you probably think. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 20:24:44
Or when Coin Market Cap decided to stop including Korea's exchanges all of a sudden, dropped 30 Billion overnight. Everyone panick sold and the correction started. There were a few reasons as to why, it is all orchestrated by the big players to get there hands on as much crypto as possible. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:24:28
You think tbe steep drops are roger ver selling his btc to pump Bitcoinabc?
