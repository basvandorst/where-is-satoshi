If you expand upon this and get it to work please let me know - I'd love to use something like this on my sight.

thanks for the advice and the tip. i'll take a look at your link and will PM you for the code if i think it will help. again - appreciate the quick response.

Actually it's one of the big 4. Pwc kpmg ey and Deloitte. They all offer core services such as audit tax and advisory (risk consulting). All 3 save Deloitte sold off their consulting branches which gives Deloitte a solid competitive advantage now. Arthur Anderson went under after the Enron scandal even though aa was acquitted of all charges. They did nothing wrong but their reputation was tarnished so they folded and most partners / professionals joined the other big 4. Deloitte and pwc are considered the market leaders w ey right behind them and kpmg trailing.

I didn't know that. I was always under the impression anyone can use Bitpay for donations - no need for a charity.
If that's the case though, then I will not use it as well.

I don't think it needs lower prices at all. People quote entire bitcoins with price. Maybe they should refer to bits instead.
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:50:31
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2015-01-31 20:24:20
One of the major reasons I pulled the trigger recently and scooped some Bitcoin is the amount of VC $ flowing in from people much smarter than me. I think the block chain is amazing technology but on my own I couldn't fathom all of its applications. When you see a few hundred million invested into a project and you have the ability to get exposure you should take the chance. Most normal people can't invest in the projects VCs support. But in the case of Bitcoin were all eligible to get exposure to the potential upside by buying Bitcoin on our own. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:56:41
I have a question on this. From everything I've read all these VCs are super excited about the block chain technology. There are more and more potential disruptive adaptations which is all great. I'm wondering does the value of the block chain automatically mean that bitcoins themselves have to have value? Is there a world where the block chain is extremely useful yet the value of bitcoins are worthless? I guess this is one of my fears although I'm happy to announce that I made my first btc purchase today so I am now one of you.

Jeez. I'll collect it. Shoot some change tips this way.

What if miners were instead paid a fee of say $50 usd or some other fiat currency to correctly discover a block or whatever the proper lingo is. Wouldn't that render btc useless? 
I'm all for Bitcoin. I'm just a bit concerned - maybe my concerns are unfounded. Thanks for your answer thought. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:31:34
In your model or idea of what banks will look like given the functionality of the block chain will there be a need for bitcoins themselves? If not what incentive will miners have? 
@_date: 2015-01-28 12:46:47
What do you genuinely expect to happen in the next few years? In terms of fiat currencies you allude - what is your price target? Or do you expect btc to become the dominant form of all transactions?

You're absolutely right. The problem with the bitcoin community is that people aren't building. Everyone just shouts "to the moon." There's no compelling development taking place. This is what is drawing so many to Ethereum - including Mike Hearn.

I like that you're taking the time to do this and gauge the interest of potential customers and the community
Nothing to dislike as of yet.

I think u/sprrd is referring to no more wild swings in either direction. You can have a stable currency on an upward trajectory. It's just difficult to have people use/accept bitcoins when the price can fluctuate 20% any given day. I think long term it is clearly going up, but I'd much rather see a stable slow rise than huge swings.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:09:07
Trying to time any trade is just dumb. If you believe in the fundamentals then just buy and hold.

I don't see how it would be stupid to accept Bitcoin. If you believe in the currency why not allow your customers to pay with it?
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:35:24
Maybe - in my mind it doesn't really matter all that much. So long as user adoption continues to rise it benefits all of us.

Agreed. Having big named billionaires behind it should provide some staying power and add comfort to those of us who are holding.

I wonder how much total investment dollars it would cost to build the infrastructure mentioned in each state. Seems like it could be better than VCs investing in another exchange.

Currently the reward is 25 btc for a mined block. That drops to 12.5 sometime in mid 2016

"People who said bitcoin would be banned are turning out to be wrong. I don’t think anyone is going to ban the NYSE anytime soon," he added.
This is a good point many here don't fully grasp. Whether or not you like / support coinbase and their practices - you should recognize that they have major backers that have cozy relationships with our govt. in my mind this means it is unlikely that said govt will try to ban Bitcoin or stop its use. That's a huge plus for us all. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:02:32
How can you suggest the price tone a gradual rise? What defines gradual? If there is a large event the drives the price everything can mo every quickly in either direction. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:18:52
If you accepted bitcoin and didn't want the exposure you could set up a program to sell it at spot on an exchange and therefore minimize risk of holding it. Accounting would be marginally impacted. You would have one additional line item for profit/loss based on translation of btc to your local currency. What you will do is empower your customers and seem more open and accepting to the public. As btc enthusiasts we should all try to give our business to those owners who are willing to accept Bitcoin thus improving upon the adoption rate.

I'm pretty sure it is way more than 3x. you can get exposure to gold buy buying the GLD which is an etf that tracks the price of gold - but just note you do not own gold. You only own a financial instrument. Gold is a bit pricey for me and I like all of the industrial uses of silver so I prefer to buy silver bars as a hedge. Mind you don't put all of your eggs in one basket. As far as getting silver exposure - you can buy pre 1965 coins which have 90% silver or you can buy silver rounds/bars. I personally have bought from apmex and found the process simple.

I don't think this is indicative of the Bears running out of ammo. It's impossible to figure out when or how much bears are willing to risk to drive the price down.
