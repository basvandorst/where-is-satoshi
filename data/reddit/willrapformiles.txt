Thanks, that’s another good reference. My takeaway here is that this stuff is kind of still a mess at this point.

Mind providing a source on that? Like, where you read it... Stuff online seems to be saying it must be FIFO. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:06:26
I think the legality around cost basis rules is still unclear (though FIFO is indisputably the most conservative, and the least likely to draw IRS attention). I feel like bitcoin.tax is just choosing to give ppl more options. Idk if that means they’re all necessarily viable. Really depends how aggressive/risky you wanna be imo.

Yeah, after doing some research online I think I’m gonna do FIFO, just to be safe. My ST and LT cap gains rates aren’t even that different this year, so why take the risk.

Hi guys - I sold some BTC this past year and I’m trying to figure out what I owe the IRS. Does anyone here know if it’s required that we use FIFO when calculating capital gains? Obviously I’d rather use LIFO or specific identification if that’s possible, but I don’t want to run afoul of IRS rules surrounding cryptos. Thanks all for the help!

Trying to figure out what I owe the IRS in BTC capital gains. Anyone know if you HAVE to calculate using FIFO, or if can you do so using LIFO/specific identification? Just trying to avoid problems w/ the IRS, but would prefer to do LIFO if that's a possibility. Thanks all.

Can someone help me for a sec here (warning: long post incoming). I’ve got a more nuanced question about capital gains for crypto… I’ll explain using an example: let’s say I bought 5 BTC at $2k earlier this year, and then sold last week at $15k — for a $65k realized short-term capital gain. The same day as the BTC sale, I poured the entire $75k in proceeds into ETH at $750 per coin (i.e., I bought 100 ETH). ETH then, hypothetically, plummeted to $250 overnight, and I sold it all — and got back $25k (i.e., I took a $50k capital loss). My question is this: can I use the $50k short-term capital loss on ETH to offset the $65k short-term capital gain on BTC? That’s question one. If the answer’s yes, that's fine, my next question would be: if I theoretically have a net short-term capital loss in the stock market this year, can I use those losses to offset some of the net $15k in short-term capital gains I have in crypto? Thanks in advance to the kind soul that helps me out here!

Idk what binance is, and clearly I'm cashing out at least some if I'm asking about taxes. What was the point of your reply?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:25:35
Just did a little more research, and I think it all goes on your Schedule D -- any assets you owned and sold that appreciated in value trigger capital gains, which end up on this tax form
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:05:27
Thanks for the helpful response. I just wanted to make sure cap gains and losses could be offset between DIFFERENT cryptos. Sounds like the answer is yes. So my next question is whether cap gains and losses can be offset between different asset classes (i.e., cryptos and stocks), and I'd suspect the answers yes, and that it's all just tallied up on your Schedule D, but I'm trying to see if I can get a definitive answer.

Keep telling yourself that buddy 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:03:32
It was hypothetical, as clearly stated above. You should probably stop commenting on posts before you make a fool of yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:09:13
Yeah no I’m completely aware of that. I just have some smaller crypto losses (in LTC), as well as a small net realized loss in stocks, and I wanted to make sure I could offset those against my larger crypto gains (in BTC and ETH). Thanks for the help!
