Nice, but just to play devils advocate you could argue that Bitcoin did change: mining costs and transaction costs changed, segwit was introduced, less bitcoin are left to be mined. Also the quality of the people changed together with their quantity: now some less knowledgeable people entered the pool as it broadened, and some institutional investors too (and there are futures). Also exchanges changed, taxation changed, altcoins are much more numerous, with even some countries starting their own crypto. It looks like the landscape is different, even though it is not clear which effect these changes will have.

Sure, and most of the time what it reveals is the utter shittiness of the person wielding it.

Fiscal deficits are quite sustainable. They have been around for decades.

This is an issue with OP’s misuse of the lightning network. The main bitcoin network is entirely safe. Use large sums of money over a beta feature at your own risk

The dumplings though. The fucking 包子, dude. Those make up for all the rest

How so?

Exactly. They saw the end of the dollar coming. You can’t force every petromonarchy to sell oil in USD forever. The public opinion didn’t like the last two or three instances of international peacekeeping required to do that, and foreign powers such as China would eventually catch up. So if USD hegemony has to become a thing of the past, why not set up the future so no one can control the world currency? Better a BTC centric world order than a Yuan or Ruble centric one for sure. Plus you can have “Satoshi” conveniently mine a couple million units of the new currency to keep in store in case they are needed once the whole world switches away from national currencies.

I do not know; but fiscal deficits per se are no big deal.

So a computer would be using electricity and converting only part of it into heat. Where does the rest go?
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:56:31
Most thermodynamics books define efficiency this way though.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:58:50
This is a pretty decent example: 
As you see they use the wording “coefficient of performance” rather than efficiency, possibly because calling it efficiency is somewhat misleading, as we found out in this thread.
If I remember correctly a similar definition was provided in Thermodynamics by E. Fermi (which I used to study) under the name efficiency.
In any case it’s the same concept.

Good old custodial services. I know it’s against the spirit but it may boost adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:09:07
Understood, thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:08:53
Ok they you are comparing invest now VS DCA. I can believe that investing now is better than DCA with some high probability (or empirically in a fraction of the past historical data). But there is no way to know if now we are at the bottom of a dip. You are basically saying “the dip is now” (almost) all the time.
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:02:05
LOL 
@_date: 2019-12-24 09:20:17
It is a synonym of efficiency in the context of heat pumps. There is no other widely accepted definition of efficiency for heat pumps that I know of. The important point here is that this number can be &gt; 1 and this does not mean we have a perpetuum mobile or any other violation. Do you get it?

SJWs will say that democracy is bad because “populists” win
@_date: 2019-12-26 23:20:10
Not being confrontational here, but my definition of scam is different. Fiat/banking system is based on lies, but exactly because of its popularity its not a scam (i.e. I am definitely not going to lose all my money tomorrow because I trusted a bank with it today, except in special circumstances). Similarly money put into EOS or even steem was not lost overnight, unless you invested at ATH. But then again that would be true for bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:46:49
The US dollar dominates the currency landscape, so they have no incentive adopting something else (bitcoin) institutionally. Other countries at this stage do not trust bitcoin yet, possibly because there are a few million in Satoshi’s hands and no one knows him. What if it turns out they are under US control? Without institutional adoption it is hard for the regular people and even corporations to switch to bitcoin, as they still need fiat for taxes, fines and paying for public services.

Indeed heat pumps are over 100% efficient and break no laws of thermodynamics. Here we are defining efficiency as heat released into your home divided by electricity spent. A simple heater runs electricity through a resistance and converts electric power to heat. It cannot beat 100% efficiency. A heat pump on the other hand moves heat from outside your house into the house, even when outside is colder than inside. By the first law of thermodynamics heat released into your house is equal to the electric energy used (work) plus heat removed from the outside. If the latter is not zero, efficiency can be above 100%.

EOS is still  on cmc, probably not doing great but still in line with other altcoins. I do not like it nor did I ever invest in it but I would not call it an outright scam.

I think there is two kinds of people who do not like the democracy chart: SJWtard types because reee brexit bad and people with valid criticisms of the “democracy” we are supposedly living in. You seem one of the latter

Surprise surprise those who hold power don’t want to give it up.

Can you point to any video where he was promoting scams?
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:49:25
This is simply not true. Difficulty adjustments are designed to make mining viable at at least some scale.
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:38:46
Tbh he could help adoption by investing ~10 million and being public about it.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:46:58
True. Analysis does not have to be TA though.

Clearly buying the dip is more profitable if you know when the dip is. On the other hand if you do not have superior information wrt the market trying to buy the dip may not work out, and you may even lose money.

No. It’s easier to multiply 37*29 than to factor 1073.
