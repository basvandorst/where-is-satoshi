The fundamental argument I've seen against BTC being some anarchist dream currency is the public ledger killing anonymity to some extent.
I don't mind it, because that's not my end goal of using crypto, just an idea I came across.

I actually wish AOL keywords still existed as a sub DNS. 
Right now I still do the same behavior, but by typing _______ word into my adress bar and clicking the first google result. 
I never even had AOL, they just had that idea right.

Nah you said


And my mind jumped to indium, which has a higher, more tangible industrial demand and I know how to recycle it from the other elements in the periodic column.
My mind wanders sometimes. haha.

I always wonder what might happen if I start hoarding blocks of indium...

I know this has been asked countless times on this sub, but can someone grab me a link to "best way to get your coins off the exchange and into long term storage"?

The amount of charges that can be brought against you are points in the graffiti world. 
The ultimate grail of grafitti is to decapitate a man with a Geneva banned weapon and write your name with the spouting neck geyser like some kind of a war-crimes sharpie. On a Holy site nonetheless.

I'll take "The exchange of goods and services for other goods and services, with fleeting bullshit in the middle" for 2 blowjobs, a cheap painting, and a hamburger, Alex.

orrrr it just stays stable and it gets less volatile?

That's the fun. 
I thought about setting up a QR that leads to an empty wallet that equates to "take a penny, leave a penny" but I have some fuzzy difficulty on the implementation.

You dont know the pain of explaining the concept of "investment" to a suicidal person.
Not talking about "bitcoin as an invesment." That's objectively open to argument. I truly mean "investment". 
And you know what? They're technically not wrong...

Soooo is mainland china a deadzone for all things?
I see a lot more than money maps where you just dont see nothin' going on at all, in an area with a metric butt ton of humans.
Ruskies and Brownies excused, y'all got shit weather and low pop densities.

Dunno what you guys are in a tizzy about. Go back to using BTC as a grey market currency. 
Edit: *Use* is value. Hate to gatekeep, but if you don't know what a dollar is for, then it's worthless to you. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 07:29:42
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:49:05


Yeah as an investment rather than a currency...is weird to me. If BTC crashes to $2, I'm still using it for its original purpose.

Yes.  Appropriation of dwarven mining culture.
