I get it. But damn Bitcoin is slow, clunky and expensive. Ethereum, litecoin, monero, zcash, dash are all light years ahead in speed and technology. Bitcoin seems like a dinosaur at the moment.

I can get that. I don't really follow all of that stuff.

Yeah, but when everyone else is pushing faster cheaper transactions and you don't update it, it becomes outdated. They should copy paste Ltc's lightning network code and be good :)
I hope they figure it out. Cause nobody is using it as a currency anymore.
Sir we will have your coffee ready in 4 to 6 hours as long as your transaction is actually processed. That will be $6 for the coffee and $21 for processing fee :)

Ethereum is processing thousands more transactions everyday than Bitcoin. Problem is no lightning network and 1 mb block size. The technology to fix Bitcoin exists, but all they want to do is fight and not fix it.

I'm pretty disappointed in Bitcoin lately. It has turned from a currency to store of value. Too much infighting.
Litecoin is was Bitcoin wanted to be.

As a currency Bitcoin has already lost. There are many faster, cheaper and anonymous coins that are better then Bitcoin as a currency. Litecoin, monero, dash, Zcash, Ethereum just to name a few.
Bitcoin is really like gold at this point. I own lots of different coins including BTC. I was extremely bullish on BTC for a long time. But it seems that Bitcoin moves very slowly on improving itself. Much like a large company :)

Not sure why everyone hates bch so much. You got free money, faster transactions and lower fees. I think litecoin is better. But with all of the shit coins out there not really sure my people hate bch so much.

You need to do a RIDICULOUS amount more research before even contemplating this.

I'm sure the billions of investment dollars they are losing out on has nothing to do with their prediction :)
