Bitcoin is the first and most popular. I wouldn't use the word "superior". In 2018 we'll see the rise of many great alt-coins. It's good to embrace diversity.

I don't know why I'm so excited about this, I don't even have a Canadian Visa anyway
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:35:30
Good to know!

There's a actually a scene in Mr. Robot where a guy tells his partner, who is refusing to buy "E-COIN": Gotta buy e-coins man, dollars are worth shit!

Great share. Thanks!

WHAT? hahaha. Actually, BTC is too mainstream to hipsters now. HE SHOULD KNOW BETTER
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:02:30
wow... there must be a lot of work to be done!

Why is it that everytime someone supports a different economical/sociological concept, they use that adjective. It's not even about that at all.

It would be interesting to do the math with Venezuela

I think at the end only the really good ones will survive and coexist. When the "boom" passes

Is it entirely for free?

Thanks for sharing your experience

Great read. Do you know if the quote "Today's crypto is 90's Internet" is originally from this article?

Are the specific reasons all that important? Or should we be looking at the fact that communities around the world are slowly turning to alt coins and cryptocurrencies as a rejection to current economy standards?

Love the headline. 
It's nice to see the dollar being a bit "humilliated" for a change, sorry, I come from a hyper-inflation economy and this is a fresh perspective for my sore eyes.

Happens to me too. Everyday ♥

I think everyone's afraid of another "Mt. Gox" episode :/
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:26:13
I'm worried that is "battle" is actually driving all the attention to bitcoin and taking us away from other new, promising cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:50:42
Security is the major issue right now. Take the time to look for the cryptocoin that takes good care of your interests
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:31:25
I often wonder about this. Wether it is a good thing that these things are happening so fast for BTC and crypto in general
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:55:24
I actually think it's a great project. Are you only going to accept bitcoins... or might consider other coins?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:14:11
Wow! amazing.
Did you any particular intermediary for this?
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:43:26
So true!
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:39:54
True, a lot is happening
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:59:14
Haha. True. I'm starting to dig Bitcoin memes.
