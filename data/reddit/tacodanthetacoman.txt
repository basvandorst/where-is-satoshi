Yup. This may be why Helloblock is dead, but I really don't know.


I hadn't considered that specifically, but have considered a similar option. The problem is that I don't want the server hosting the application to touch the data going to the blockchain. The problem isn't technical, but legal. I want the server to provide a general purpose tool, and then remain completely ignorant of how the client uses it. I would rather take the project out of the browser than require the server to handle data coming to and from the blockchain.

That whitepaper was interesting, but I'm still keeping my private keys in paperwallets and encrypted flashdrives for the moment.


I hope you are correct. If you're incorrect, you may have a ton of users lose their coins overnight. And whereas Mt. Gox was primarily an exchange that happened to store coins for unsavvy users, the product you are offering is primarily a wallet. You are advertising it as a secure solution. If the shit hits the fan, most users are going to see this as yet another failure of Bitcoin (instead of seeing it as a failure of breadwallet, or Apple, or some three-letter-agency that ordered backdoors). I do wish you the best of luck as far as security goes, but I also find myself hoping that users don't trust your service.

Since last I posted, their mainnet API is also down. I still have very little info, all I know can be found in [this post.](

The reference to heartbleed was meant as an analogy, but I see how my intent could be confused.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:08:44
Is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:15:51
I don't know how to steal bitcoins from your breadwallet, but I don't feel comfortable saying it can't be done. Until heartbleed, OpenSSL looked pretty secure. Now OpenSSL looks pretty secure again, and it will remain that way until the next heartbleed (if there is another heartbleed). I'm not putting bitcoins on an iPhone, and I don't feel comfortable recommending that option to anybody else unless they are dealing with small numbers.

Hey man, the API seems to be broken again. It's about 8,200 blocks behind my locally running testnet client now. Looks like maybe it stopped verifying blocks 9 hours ago, and hasn't been trying to catch up? I have no idea why. It was working fine yesterday.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:24:15
That is an interesting option, I may use it. Thanks for the input.

What if [your GPU has a keylogger in it?](
I understand that this is an uncommon, almost unheard of attack vector. I still don't put private keys on an internet-connected system unless I intend to immediately build and propagate a transaction. I'm not telling you that you should be this paranoid, you can take whatever risks you want, but acting like there is "nothing" an attacker could do once you're out of the live distro is misleading. If your live distro uses the same hardware as your normal distro, you're relying on the fact that your hardware isn't compromised.
Paperwallets generated on systems that never again touch the internet are not susceptible to this sort of attack.

I don't really feel comfortable telling most people that they should use bitcoins. Quite frankly, most people have terrible security practices and cannot be trusted to handle their own private keys responsibly. Think about how many people in the current community got burned by Mt. Gox. If you can't handle your own private keys responsibly, you probably shouldn't have private keys. I hate to say it, but being coddled and throttled by creditcard companies is perhaps preferable to keeping your nonrefundable bitcoins in hot storage. Until there is a safe, secure, simple system that your grandpa can use to make Bitcoin transactions, Bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream adoption. Sorry. I love cryptocurrencies, but I only argue for their use when I think I'm talking to somebody who can actually keep their private keys secure.

Most people have plenty of training keeping cash stored in a *relatively* secure state. The problems with storing private keys are different. It's impossible to leave cash lying on your harddrive waiting for somebody to run off with it. If you're using paper wallets that have been securely generated, the problem of storing cash is very similar (there are still caveats). Most people probably aren't going to use paper wallets, and if they are they're not going to generate them in a manner that remains secure.
I understand the parallels between bitcoin's nonreversibility and the nonreversibility of cash, but the reversible nature of creditcard transactions is only important to this discussion because of the parallels between a creditcard pin and a private key (both can be compromised by compromising the computer that they are stored on). 
Physical security != information security.

Your breadwallet is definitely more usable and convenient than paperwallets or encrypted flashdrives, I never contested that.
Remember, I'm not arguing that paperwallets and encrypted media are a suitable solution for the typical user; I'm arguing that there is no satisfactory solution for the typical user yet (at least that I'm aware of), but that *when used correctly* paperwallets and encrypted media provide more reliable security than a smartphone hotwallet.
I've never actually spent funds after encrypting them, but when I do I intend to decrypt them on a secure machine and convert them into a paperwallet first.

I don't think we've seen all of the implications of distributed, uncensorable data storage play out in the legal system. See [Cryptograffiti]( about page, where they claim to have no legal responsibility for what comes and goes through their servers simply because it is transmitted as hex instead of in a human-readable form. I'm not sure that this would stand up in a court. I'm not sure that even being in possession of the blockchain is a safe practice, legally. As far as I know, there haven't been any court rulings on it yet. Everybody in possession of the blockchain may be committing a crime, and somebody operating a website that intentionally allows arbitrary data to be put on the blockchain might be a more obvious target for prosecution than an average user.
This is my fear, well-founded or otherwise.

Helloblock's testnet api is functioning again.
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:33:06
You guys should read the comments in these two posts, if you haven't: 
 
 
Note that while the helloblock api is now ahead of the biteasy api by almost 10,000 blocks (a few days ago the biteasy api was ahead), it is still verifying new blocks ridiculously fast so I'm pretty sure it's still trying to sync with a more complete copy of the blockchain. I'm not actually sure what the largest block height that has now been mined on the testnet is, so it's hard to say how long this process will take. I suspect this will work itself out soon, but I completely sympathise with your frustration at suddenly having an api break. It threw a wrench in my works as well.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:24:37
Yo, it looks like the helloblock API is about 8,700 blocks behind my where locally running bitcoind seems to top out. It's a moving target, obviously. I'm just guessing, but maybe another 30 hours or so before they sync?
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:37:31
If anybody cares, it seems like the hello-block api is currently attempting to sync back up. You can watch it here: 
Note that the blocks are significantly earlier than the latest blocks on the biteasy api.
Right now the hello-block api is at about block 331735 and the biteasy api is at about block 350226, but the former is gaining on the latter.
