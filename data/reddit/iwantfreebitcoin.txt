Thanks for all the detailed info! Can you please remove the link to the scam site, though? Let's make sure nobody accidentally clicks on it.

It usually arrives at around the same time of day that you placed the order, give or take an hour or so (but no guarantee). So if you place your order at 3 PM, it'll likely arrive between 2-4 PM or so on the day it is supposed to arrive.

They mean a safe place to buy and sell BTC, and that they hold their BTC in a local or hardware wallet, not a web wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-10 04:38:16
I hate to tell you, but you've been scammed. That's a fake site designed to steal your deposits. As of right now, this is the real site: 
By the way....don't take my word for that! I'm just a random person on the internet, and it would be a really bad idea to do so. That being said, at least right now, you can probably find other sources that would corroborate that this is the appropriate link.
As for your question about what to do....I suggest moping around for a few minutes knowing that you've lost your coins. It happens to everyone. It sucks ass.
@_date: 2016-04-10 05:03:57
There are some people (hopefully not you right now) who lose dozens, hundreds, or thousands of BTC that way. It's a cheap lesson, honestly, if you don't lose too much. Makes you way more savvy in the future, I'd think.

is saying that the high fees for Bitcoin are largely a function of its price increase. Essentially, you are "blaming" it for its success (in the price dimension, denominated in fiat). You must compare like with like. Yes, if you transact with ether, you will pay a lower fee. But this doesn't say anything about how well it handles scaling.

Regardless of efficiency, we are discussing proof size. The proofs for starks are substantially larger; that is a primary thing that has held them back. Perhaps they've managed to reduce the size recently and I'm not aware of the details, but at least for a while, it seemed there would be three-figure kb proofs.

Unless they pass the cost of the transactions off to their customers.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:14:47
Agreed. I'm not sure why people seem to care about this so much. I suspect it is a semantic confusion. We talk about the virtues of decentralization so much (rightly so), but it is in a different context than this. A "centralized" topography is not particularly important when there is minimal counterparty risk.

It doesn't seem necessary that he would have mentioned it in the whitepaper. Satoshi did not foresee everything that would happen in the bitcoin universe. If he made this statement years later, so what?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:37
If you cannot have any loss than you cannot hold bitcoin (for now). You do realize that bitcoin is insanely volatile and probably will be for another decade or so, right?

That's totally fair, I think.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:12:10
I definitely respect your viewpoint here and it sucks that people got scammed. But the reason it is good that BCC collapsed is that it means no more people will be scammed by them. I take it as a given that scams will exist, so it is always a good thing when they die. 
Think of it this way: those who were tricked into buying BCC were scammed *at that point*. The collapse of BCC isn't the problem, it has just *revealed* the problem.

STARKS are what he was responding about. SNARKS aren't nearly as large.

Beating fiat money could go a long way towards bringing about that world you are hoping for :)
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:41:09


I think this is an apples to oranges comparison. You are properly measuring inflation of Bitcoin based on the increase in the money supply, but you are measuring "inflation" of USD by increases in the price level as determined by some (flawed/imprecise) index. I don't know the actual numbers for USD inflation of money supply, but I bet it is substantially more than 3%. Comparing simply based on an index, Bitcoin has been massively "deflationary", though I don't think this is the proper way of comparing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:00


Where did I say this? My point is that a few years ago, people would toss their hard drives whether they knew they had BTC on it or not, because they didn't necessarily expect it to be worth holding onto. That won't happen again. I'm not blaming anyone for anything, just making a really obvious point that you seem resistant to acknowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:18
Well *obviously* you can have known about bitcoin for longer than the existence of your reddit account, but there is no way for us to verify your claim. The claim that you made was that you were "here" - aka on reddit - back in the day. You weren't, at least not with this account. 


And what do you think the relevance of SPV is to your point?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:03:31
Some nodes need to store the full state so that new nodes can sync from scratch in a trustless, verifiable way.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:57:18
Thanks for bringing this up. It is disgusting to read the posts on this thread telling you to post elsewhere and or suggest something better or anything like that. If the specs make a security claim that is wrong, this is a problem. It does not matter which "side" you are on. You could be a total FUDster (you don't strike me as one) but if we play our cards right, all you are doing is improving the protocol for me to use. 
Anyways, privacy on higher protocol layers is an interesting problem. I may think about this some more :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:37
Your link is not about SPV. You could use that in an argument against RBF if you want, but it has nothing to do with SPV.

Very few random people on the Internet care about what some confirmed random douche "plans". A very significant sum of money was donated to a cause that you clearly support, and here you are calling the benefactor cheap. Meanwhile, what do you do?

If anything, 0-conf goes against the concept of bitcoin. Now, I have nothing against 0-conf, if people want to take that risk I don't have a problem with it. But 0-conf transactions literally have zero proof of work, so I'm not sure you can say that they have anything to do with the "concept of bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:43:53
With blind merged mining, the sidechains could share the security/hash rate with bitcoin instead of needing their own PoW bootstrapped.

Yeah, that's a good point actually. I can imagine self-driving cars with  LN wallets and getting invoiced automatically based on sensors on the roads...or something. A nice, elegant technical solution to a not substantial problem, because private roads are already reasonable :)

If it cost you a large amount of money to forget where you put your keys, then you would pay more attention. Generally, we know we'll find our keys again, or be able to get someone to help and mitigate whatever harms come from that loss.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:09:27
The more valuable it becomes, the more careful people will be to prevent loss. But very, very gradually, perhaps!
@_date: 2018-09-13 21:54:17
And if we assume that all miners are following the first seen rule (not that we should), they won't propagate tx 2 which performs the double spend. Do you know whether the transaction with the unconfirmed parent (the first one, or tx 3 in the gist) would be propagated since it is the child of a double spend that isn't received first? I imagine it wouldn't be, since it will appear to be an invalid transaction to any node that hasn't seen tx 2 yet, and that won't be propagated when following the first seen rule.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:14:42
There is more to it than this, but the starting point is that a larger block size increases the resources needed for running a node. The more difficult and expensive it is to run a node, the fewer people who will do so. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:23:31
No clue! I've got to imagine it has received fairly little thought at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:43
Seems plausible to me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:55:59
Right, but the point I'm making is that one would expect people to become more careful as bitcoin's value increases. There might always be some amount of loss, but I predict it will be rapidly decreasing.
@_date: 2018-09-25 23:59:17
Also, imagine trying to use bitcoin safely if you are blind (for example).
@_date: 2018-09-18 23:11:20
Excellent. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:53:57


This is misleading. The transactions don't use any electricity. As bitcoin grows to be able to process more transactions, the cost per transaction goes down because the cost isn't directly related to the transactions themselves.

There is an approximately five minute cancellation period from the main transaction page, though this isn't really advertised heavily. Also I don't believe it is strictly five minutes - but you CAN typically cancel a transaction if you change your mind immediately.
@_date: 2015-12-08 19:33:09
I believe it is just your main transaction history page, and it literally only lasts a few minutes. So if that window closed, you wouldn't be able to see that option anymore.

Possible, but that seems a bit premature. Some attacks were found against Schnorr in the bitcoin context that weren't understood when first proposed - and I believe that solutions to known attacks were found, but that may scare us into some added caution. I *think* I saw Pieter comment recently that he thinks Schnorr is still approximately 3 years out, but don't quote me (or him) on that, since I am taking this from memory.
I sure hope we get it by EOY 2019, that'd be fantastic.
@_date: 2018-05-25 00:16:02
I think it is a bit premature to be recommending this as a serious privacy technique. The reality is, we do not know how well LN protects privacy. It likely helps in some ways \(no permanent data stored on chain or broadcast to the world\) and hurts in others \(providing more information to certain specific people, like channel partners\). Hopefully in the future this will all be improved \- maybe some Schnorrified CoinJoins to join channel factories, or something. I can't wait.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:22:52
You are correct, the attack will start close to the tip of the chain with recent blocks.
@_date: 2018-05-08 00:46:24
We are likely several years away from Schnorr sigs though, sadly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:02:35
I've been here for some time, actually. I, like you (maybe?) was around for a while before creating a reddit account, but you can see that I've been around here since 2015. 
More importantly, you don't seem interested in tackling the actual point regarding SPV, so I'll just mention (in case anyone is reading) that SPV still requires validating proof of work. It does not require downloading the whole blockchain, but it doesn't make 0-conf any more viable, since the whole thing with SPV is that you do validate that a transaction was included in a block.
Feel free to stop being a douche at your leisure, and show me how ignorant I am.

In short, for security reasons. It is more difficult to have a fork or orphaned blocks with a longer block time because:
1. Network latency means that when one miner finds a block it takes some positive amount of time for that information to be received and confirmed by the rest of the network, and some other miner may have found another legitimate block during that time.
2. More proof of work for a block in general makes it harder for someone to mount attacks. 
There are obviously tradeoffs (transaction throughput, for instance), but the point is that it creates additional certainty in the integrity of the ledger.
EDIT: Note that there is no "cap" as you mention. The system is meant to have one block mined on average every ten minutes. It can take longer or shorter than that, but over time the system continuously adjusts in order to maintain that average.

As u/SeemedGood said, there HAVE been debt crises, but as the issuer of the world's reserve currency, the US has some significant advantages in terms of kicking the can down the road. So did Great Britain. Countries/regions that aren't as lucky have debt crises more easily, such as Greece, Puerto Rico, etc.
When you include unfunded liabilities, the debt to GDP ratio is poised to explode over the next twenty years or so. [Source: CBO](
But more important than debt-to-GDP is the debt-to-revenue anyways. The government doesn't have access to 100% of the GDP, and even substantially increasing taxes will *not* substantially increase revenue. So if the interest owed on the debt is rising every year but tax revenue isn't, the situation becomes more and more precarious. Reserve currency status helps here in terms of kicking the can down the road, but monetizing such a massive debt can lead to some pretty serious inflation. 
In any case, it makes paying for social programs a lot more challenging, which was the original point.
@_date: 2016-03-04 14:00:19
The 3% fee is probably for credit cards. If you buy from your bank or using the credit card as a backup, it should only be 1%. And if you use your USD wallet and trade on the exchange, the fee is either .25% or 0%, depending on whether you add or subtract liquidity from the market at that time.

Things like homomorphic encryption, which allow researchers to work with data and perform operations on it, without decrypting the data itself. This would maintain the privacy of peoples' information in the database while still allowing research to be done with it.
Unfortunately, we're still a little ways away from this being reality. Some people at MIT are working on a project called Enigma that has similar goals but uses bitcoin. Eventually, this kind of tech will exist and solve the problem.

You can verify your credit card for 3D secure in order to buy bitcoin from them on credit, and that incurs a 3% fee. But you can also verify the CC to be used as a backup payment method; in this case, you still buy directly from your bank account using ACH with a 1% fee, but if there are any issues debiting your account, the credit card would be charged.

I'm not sure why you replied to my comment, but I think you are missing the point here. Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin adopt Algorand. This is academic - it can be implemented in an altcoin, but Micali has written an academic paper describing a new method to achieve consensus in a permissionless environment. It is similar to proof of stake, yes. But as I said, he describes in the paper a new algorithm for byzantine agreement in a permissionless setting. This is a novel academic result, not a waste of time.

I was aware of this, which is why I figured that as long as you can SPV-on-SPV on the side chain, most big blockers could get the capacity they want with the SPV security they expect. 


Do I need to trust that they operate the drivechain correctly? If I don't use the drivechain, it seems to me that I can just pretend it doesn't exist and continue on without being impacted, but that's the point I want clarified. That is, if I do not pay attention to the drivechain and don't care whether drivechain users get scammed, does the existence of the drivechain have any impact on me as a mainchain full node operator?

You only have a loss when you sell or use the BTC. The reason your wallet says that BTC value is less than 10 is because the USD/BTC exchange rate has likely decreased in the hours since you purchased. You have the same amount of BTC, but what it would trade for in USD is now lower. 
If you are getting into bitcoin, learn to expect volatility. You will drive yourself insane if large price changes cause you anxiety :)
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:00:53
Very true. It'll be interesting how things play out. But there will probably be more and more cases of corruption (like in the Silk Road cases) where government agents realize they can do quite well for themselves. Perhaps we'll see stuff similar to local police getting bought off by drug cartels to let things slide. And maybe the elite will just hedge their bets: buy bitcoin while crusading against it, and then the outcome will be hard to predict.

It's kind of interesting that this is frequently ignored, but the purpose of money is to coordinate spending *over time*, which implies some amount of "hoarding" - although hoarding seems like a loaded term. Obviously for it to be useful it needs to be spendable/saleable, but the point is that it can be spent, not that it  is spent.

For future reference, even if fees are very high, if you are just sending the BTC to yourself and are hodling, you could set a low fee and not care that it takes days to confirm. Of course, for most of 2018 you can easily get confirmed within the next few blocks for a few pennies.

Thanks for the detailed comments. 


Is there no such thing as SPV for sidechains? That is, if there is a big block sidechain (for example), would anyone who wants to transact on that sidechain need to run a full sidechain node? I know the security would at least be reduced, but is it not possible to have a light sidechain node? Most big blockers are fine with the reduced security of SPV already and don't want to run full nodes, so this would be a very important point to clarify.


You seem knowledgeable. Can you elaborate on how Drivechains differ from the non-federated SPV proof sidechains in this regard? If I want to run a fully validating node but don't care about a particular Drivechain, is the existence of that Drivechain going to drive up my bandwidth consumption?
@_date: 2016-12-15 05:13:40


You are making the distinction between absolute and relative rates. In health related fields, the media often reports relative amounts (the 100% you mention) because it makes things sound more sensational, even though the absolute change is typically far more important. In this case, the absolute case continues to be more relevant - the rate hike is pretty insignificant in absolute terms. Imagine you personally get an extra .25% interest on your bank account - I'm betting you wouldn't particularly care.

Second, has there been any progress on non-federated sidechains over the past year or so? Drivechains just started a testnet, but this is different from the SPV sidechains originally discussed.

@_date: 2018-06-01 22:31:12
Why would this not happen within a single industry? The idea of a deflationary spiral is simply that if people expect the price of a good to decrease over time, they will withhold purchasing, decreasing the demand for the item, and accelerating the fall in price. Presumably, this is supposed to be a bad thing which causes businesses to fail because people stop buying their products. Why would this need to be economy-wide? If everyone was thinking "I won't buy a computer because it'll be cheaper next year", and this thought process caused demand for computers to drop, then should we not be seeing computing businesses failing left and right?

The energy used in bitcoin mining is used to move the chain forward, but doesn't "power" anything that has already occurred. The Lightning Network doesn't need to be "retrofitted" - once deployed, we can use it and enjoy its benefits. 
Energy expenditure follows revenue and therefore price. Miners will mine as long as it is profitable, so after initial hardware costs, it is mostly electricity. People will use this electricity if the value of the block reward &gt; expected cost to mine it.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:21:53
We don't want to prevent a fee market because doing so would lead to the utter collapse of the coin within a decade or two. Fees need to be sufficient to entice miners to mine and keep the difficulty high. Since day one it was clear that bitcoin's security model would need to rely on transaction fees as the block subsidy decreased - consider the early days of free transactions a "loss leader" for the network to bootstrap adoption.
Imagine a decade from now, when the block subsidy is 1.5625 BTC, and contrast the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks at that time. If BCH can manage to fill 32 MB blocks with 1 sat/byte transactions, that's .32 BCH, for a total reward of 1.8825. Bitcoin, on the other hand, was able to get 10+ BTC in fees for some blocks. Which chain will be the secure one: the one where miners get 1.8825 BCH, or the one where miners get 11+ BTC? You would be counting on the purchasing power of BCH being at least five times as high as BTC just in order to split the hash rate evenly.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:18:05
The high value just ends up increasing the competition, which leads to faster blocks, which leads to a difficulty increase, which brings the profits back down.

When the difficulty goes up, the costs of mining increase. It takes more hashes, and thus more electricity and equipment in order to find a block.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:00:11
I know this has already been answered, but I'll point out that payment channels *without* segwit wouldn't have been able to stay open indefinitely. At least I'm pretty sure that's the case. Obviously, this is now irrelevant for Bitcoin, but if a non-segwit competitor wanted to add payment channels, this would be an issue.

@_date: 2017-11-05 15:44:18
The mining effort is not intrinsically tied to the number of transactions made with bitcoin. The metric "energy expenditure / transaction" isn't useful here, because the bitcoin network could process many more transactions without increasing hashrate.

@_date: 2015-08-30 21:51:06
I still don't understand what you mean - my apologies! Currencies are generally considered fungible, and one dollar is indistinct from any other dollar. The "quality" of a given paper money is basically just how scarce it is. The more scarce, the higher quality. What does it mean to print "better" money? 
I'd also argue that most governments aren't particularly concerned about their currencies surviving - at least not until the point is reached where there is a very serious threat to its survival. Until then, it seems that governments like to do everything in their power to destroy their own currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:01
Unless I'm missing something....competition would drive the profits down to zero. Whatever amount of hashing is applied, the difficulty will adjust and whatever margin was enjoyed for the prior ~ 2 weeks would quickly evaporate. 
Now of course, as long as mining is profitable, then SOME profit could be had with this...but it seems awfully wasteful, and definitely not enough to fund any major government programs.
That being said, it wouldn't surprise me if governments got in on mining at some point. Interesting times we live in!

See the paper called "On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains". It is getting old by now so the numbers are imperfect, but in 2016 their claim was that anything above 4 MB would be explicitly dangerous, and allowed for the possibility that lower numbers would be dangerous as well if there were factors they hadn't considered. Most likely that number would be more like 6-7 MB today. But these numbers would be to maintain decentralization at "current" levels (or 2016 levels), but Bitcoin's mining was quite centralized at the time. It seems to be improving a little bit.

For far less hash capacity than that, they can double spend anyone who is relying on solely them for blockchain data and accepts payments with few confirmations.

I would add that there should be a distinction drawn between two types of "medium blockers": conservative and aggressive. The people you listed would fall into the aggressive camp, whereas I and perhaps others would be a conservative medium-blocker. The problem is that a block size increase requires a hard fork, which has serious security and centralization risks (and as such, sets a bad precedent). If we could magically just have a 2 MB block size (8 MB block weight) without needing to fork, I would wholeheartedly support that. An understandable lack of consensus makes the hard fork dangerous, but in 3-5 years I suspect that consensus will emerge for a hard fork. 
And if we've managed to figure out how to make Bitcoin scale without ever needing to increase the block size, that'd be great! It's also another reason for pushing off a hard fork, because research may find ways we can delay it even further.

@_date: 2019-01-17 16:11:28
Indeed - I've been doing a little bit of preliminary work on a high-level design for a steganographic relay that may be able to conceal membership in the network (or rather, conceal membership from all but a known, bounded, and small number of peers), with the goal being able to run at least a neutrino-style client from "behind enemy lines" so to speak, without being detected. My model relies on not having an Internet blackout.
I guess my main question about the satellite, phrased better, is whether a censor could target this signal specifically. Because if a powerful entity could stop Bitcoin from flowing without disrupting much else, they may be willing to do it. But if the signal is "tangled" with much else, then the entity may need to do block satellite radio, GPS, etc., causing much more damage. 
Governments have shown that they are willing to at least occasionally do a complete Internet blackout, so if the satellite was already "jamming resistant" in the way I mean it, then I should stop thinking about an Internet-based design, because it would automatically be inferior.


This is absolutely what I'm hoping for, but I think we are still years away from this reality. I'm glad that people are working on it and recognize its importance, though.

I think this is a cool idea. But it requires adding a lot of metadata to transactions in the wallet in order to be used effectively, right? As in, any tx that contains a change output needs to be labeled for what the tx was for, and the output itself needs to be labeled/connected to the purpose of the original tx. Obviously, this requires some work for the user, which is fine, but it also means that the wallet/app itself will have a lot more data about the user, and those labels may be recoverable from memory on the device. It might be wise to include some counterforensics for this info.

Source on it being a glitch? The behavior makes it look clearly malicious. 
And sure, after surpassing 50%, they (eventually) went away. But my point is that they acted maliciously, had their behavior revealed, and then were effectively *rewarded* with a doubling in hashrate over an extended period of time. In other words, miners holding mining pools responsible for bad behavior is far from guaranteed.

As a counterpoint though, GHash launched double spend attacks in September 2013, which were made public that November. At that time, they only had 25% of the hashrate, which means that even after it was revealed that they were misbehaving, they were able to double their hash rate in well under a year.

CoinJoin does not require revealing your private key to anyone else. Basically, everyone agrees to a set of outputs, and then each person signs their input individually after making sure that their output is included in the transaction. Then everyone passes signatures around so everyone can construct the full transaction.

[On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains](
tldr: The upper bound of safe scaling via increasing block size is 4 MB. Unknown factors may make it less than 4. As mentioned in the paper, that is *without* taking into consideration that at a block size of 1 MB, the top 10% of nodes received blocks 2.4 minutes faster than the bottom 10% of nodes, which can impact mining fairness and give significant advantages to more well-connected miners.

Doesn't matter. Both buyers and sellers give each other feedback. But you are probably better off with smaller orders at first.


20% off seems pretty standard. Usually my orders are between $30-100 with 20% off, and they are almost always picked up within 24 hours. I once tried asking for 30% off, but it wasn't picked up for five or six days so I adjusted back down.

True, and that's what makes investing and day trading difficult. Buying bitcoin at the top of the market at $1200/BTC may indeed have been a good idea, if, for instance, if the price of 1 bitcoin rises to $10000 tomorrow, and you didn't need to sell your holdings in the past year.

I've reused Amazon wishlists and it has worked. I can't confirm this, but I think it is an issue when a Purse order hasn't completed before you reuse the wishlist. In other words:
1. Use wishlist A to place order on Purse
2. Order is accepted, bitcoin in escrow
3. Reuse wishlist A, now empty
4. Place new order with wishlist A on Purse
I think that this causes issues. However, every time I've waited for an order to complete, reusing the wishlist seems fine.

No doubt physical objects are more costly to protect (at least for basic   users, ie, people holding small amounts of bitcoin for themselves. This may or may not be true for exchanges trying to secure hot wallets, though.)


I feel like I know what you mean by this, but "when used correctly" most things are fairly easy to protect, including gold. And perhaps it is easier to use gold correctly than it is bitcoin. Even if you use a hardware wallet, you are susceptible to phishing attacks - and I suspect it is far easier to fall victim to bitcoin phishing attempts than gold phishing.
