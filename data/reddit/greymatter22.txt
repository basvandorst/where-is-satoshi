You can transfer to Quadriga via your quadriga bitcoin address.
Not to bank account unless you cash it out first.

It is safe to tell people to invest in a balanced mutual fund after they answer a standardized questionnaire, keep them invested in conservative funds, a bit of an equity fund but document their account accordingly.
This is industry wide, reason being is if you advise clients to purchase stocks, or let them speculate in the market, it can turn to shit very very quickly.
Should your recommended stocks or say bitcoin here goes down even by a little bit, customers will rush to regulatory bodies to complain against you, which means you might pay hefty fines and loose your job.
This is VERY common, hence banks and advisers will recommended conservative funds with mediocre returns according to their answers on the questionnaire.
If customers want bitcoins, let them leave to figure out themselves than risk yourself drowning in lawsuits.

It’ll come with all their typical Wall Street games, the *real* volatility will start once Wall Street traders start up their shenigand, expect fake walls, bids/ask manipulation like you have never seen before.
However, this means smart money is coming with big bull signals.

I bought at $6000, it went to $7600 in 5 days, I was super happy on how easy it was.
Two weeks later, it crashed to $5500, I went red, it then went to $19500 in 4 weeks, this shit is insane yet so much fun hodling.

I watched the documentary recently.
Respect to these two guys, back in 2010 these guys used to go by the New York Stock Exchange and auction Bitcoin, the dude even risked his savings buying a 'Bitcoin Exchange' around the area. They are the true MVPs, putting all the hustle when Bitcoin had almost no recognition.

I haven't lost on bitcoin yet, however I am no wizard, I have missed out on bull runs or held my shares longer to miss out on a sell outs as well.

Read this diagram for some perspective, enough money in this world makes Bitcoin's gigantic market cap just a drop in the ocean:

This is ACTUALLY realistic if people stop trading and just hodl in complete synergy.

I kept reading 'bitcoin to the moon' posts since it used to be $500, finally did my research and brought it at an all time high of $5700, almost doubled my investment.

I am more happy on BCH crashing than our own Bitcoin reaching new highs.

Kraken is in my opinion pretty ideal. I usually buy using nTrust, no fees so I buying on every 'dip', however the spreads at 2% over asking which is insane.
Once I buy my bitcoins through nTrust (free funding so I use the exchange as a funding account only) i transfer to Kraken and then life gets easy, pretty of liquidity. I am from Canada btw, so not as many options as my neighbours down south.

The Russian media is actually very smart in their programming, more smart than we credit them for.
It is anti-U.S imperialism and government but will support the American masses, to win the hearts and minds of the people and support them against their government, meanwhile it’ll be no big deal if Russia does some shady dealings on the back end.

AI being prominent in fund management would mean an end to most finance jobs across financial hubs around the world. 
So, if AI becomes widespread, what effects do you see on the work force as a result?
