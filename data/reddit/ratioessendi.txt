Yep, it works for both parties if the buyer is in a position to immediately replace the the BTC they spent AND the merchant gives a discount.
I don't buy with BTC unless I'm in a position to immediately restock AND the merchant is discounting by over 10%. That covers the buy-sell spread and the tx fees, usually.
If the tx fee is too high on the day, I just wait. I'm only using segwit addresses now though, so that's not so tricky.
End of the day it's all profit and loss right? If a thing is going to cost me $2000 fiat, but the merchant will sell it for $1600 (buy-price equivalent) in Bitcoin, then that will cost me $1600 + even if the tx fee is $50 I'm still well ahead.
If that sum doesn't put me ahead, then I buy with fiat.

Congratulations and welcome! Top tip: check regularly for threads that are celebrating a sudden price launch - it's a heck of a buzz to be hanging with people all shouting "WOO 5000! TO THE MOON!" in real time. I think the 10,000 celebration is going to be a hell of a party...
Just to be boring and 40 about it - BTC is YOUR future. Everyone buying in (and hodling) now will benefit from the price going up for the next X years, but at some point Bitcoin will find a level. 
There's no such thing as free money - your position is only going up because other people are taking profit by selling their BTC. And they are only taking profit because other other people are giving up the opportunity to spend their fiat on, you know, food and shelter and lifestyle enhancements, to buy BTC.
You presumably earned your 60 from work or whatever, but what getting paid REALLY lets you do is transform your work, I dunno, mowing lawns into work making videogames - which in turns allows you to realise the product of that work ie a videogame.
That's the point of money remember: to allow you to get the product of work you haven't done, by instead doing a different kind of work that somebody else wants. Right now we entirely depend upon this system to feed ourselves (unless you are one of those self-sufficiency smallholding geeks with a jersey cow, some chickens, a veggie patch and half an acre of pot out the back).
By purchasing 60 worth of BTC, you've basically donated your "work" to the Bitcoin cause, at a time when it's not 100% certain this will be an economically sensible thing to do. If Bitcoin crashes and dies (unlikely) then your 60 and your "work" will be lost, which is bad. 
But there's a very strong possibility that Bitcoin will turn out to be a superior way of letting people transform their work into other work, and a more efficient way of combining all human work into a central pool from which each of us can draw, according to the agreed value of the work we put in.
So thank you, for backing Bitcoin at this early stage.
However, if 1.0BTC does end up = a few hundred grand, then the classy thing to do will be to give thanks to all those people who came after you and gave their hard-earned fiat to also support the cause. And ultimately, when you come to use your BTC to buy the work/output of others, you must give thanks to those who continued to do actual work while you (and the rest of us) simply sat and hodled. 
What really wouldn't be helpful for us as a society is having a bunch of Bitcoin-billionaires strutting around waving their... uh... smartphones I guess?... saying "HA HA SUCKERS SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT EARLY HAHA!"
But that's just me being boring and 40 about it.

I wouldn't be so sure that your VISA provides you anything at "no cost". Does your card have an annual fee? And if not, does it have minimum spending requirements to avoid an annual fee? Is the price you pay for anything adjusted upward to take merchants fees into account?
Of course you will answer "No, no and no" but especially on that last one - how can you be SURE? 
For Bitcoin and others, all that cash back and rewards points stuff will come, and in fact I'd say it's a sure bet that VISA will one day operate on top of a crypto of some kind. It might be better, because (theoretically) you should be able to drill down and see the fine details of every transaction and see which part was tx fee and which part was VISA just charging you 40c for no reason.

This is not an abstract question I am asking. Do you really expect us to believe that you would say, through the pain, "no no doctor, I cannot pay, therefore I would be robbing you, please, just let me die"?

WTF is pretzellike about this? He thinks the reason he has to wait for his elective procedure is because of Medicare. He thinks if he didn't pay his medicare levy (which is 2% of your income, by the way) he could afford to pay for his procedure, cash. I'm saying I think he's wrong about that.
Of course, he may be on a salary of $250,000, which means his medicare levy is $5000, plus he's rich enough to have to pay a medicare surcharge of a further 1.5%. So his total "healthcare tax bill" is $8750. A year.
If he's single, he'd be better off buying private health care because doing so means he doesn't have to pay the medicare levy surcharge (saving $3750). Bit if he has a wife and kids, he'll get a shitload of tax breaks and family tax benefits and whatnot.
Yes, private insurance gives you access to private hospitals and lets you get stuff like knee reconstruction and various other surgeries the government - somewhat arbitrarily at times - deems non essential. 
But even if he pays for private health care, HE STILL GETS THE GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE if he needs it!
If he's out on the town drunk, and loses his ID, and gets run over and taken to hospital and put back together... there's no QUESTION of problems with "the bill" because all the emergency care is taken care of by the government, and once someone finds him and contacts his private health provider, he can get a private room or demand a particular surgeon etc.
The TLDR of this is that, in Australia, to be in a situation where the government is MAKING you pay US-levels of health insurance (something over $3500 a year for individuals, on average, I believe? Which doesn't give you blanket coverage by ANY means) via tax, you have to be rich as shit. $3500 is 2% of $175,000!!
And the BIG difference is that when you need medical care in Australia, if what you have is trying to kill you, you just get the care. No questions. No "limits". You just get to fight the cancer or the parasite as a human being, not as an underwriter's liability.
The differences in Australian and US healthcare aren't just that the government will pay to save our lives and splint our ankles and scoop our brains back into our skulls. It's that for the price of 2% of your income, you get the change to "beat this thing" without worrying that your course of treatment is only covered for 9 months, or you will be refused a payout because you had an infected ingrown toenail one time etc etc.
If you are a normal person's salary of like, $60,000 and you think $1200 is too much to pay to know that you will never be kicked into the street with a packet of aspirin and an insincere "good luck"... well you're just stupid.

No, see, in this analogy, r/Bitcoin is Coke and /BTC is Pepsi. OP says don't go into /BTC and, like, gloat or whatever. I'm saying take an example of Coke - Coca-Cola has always "won" the cola wars, and as the winner, it never makes ads that gloat about it. Coke is number one, so it just doesn't mention its competition. That's what I'm saying should be like.
As an aside, PepsiCo and the Coca-Cola Company are actually pretty even depending how you measure it. Coca-Cola made less revenue last year but slightly more net income. Apparently it's because Pepsi has a bunch of "billion dollar brands" that aren't beverages, and Coca Cola is 100% beverages - and people are drinking less soda.

Oh well, no disagreement there. 
One of the really good things about this whole crypto revolution is that it's highlighting the weaknesses and limitations of fiat (which was the whole point of Bitcoin in the first place I guess!).
The chances of your bank stealing all your money is very very low... these days. But if your bank fails, you won't necessarily be able to get all your money out of it.
I've mentioned a couple of times that in Australia, the government guarantees your bank balance up to $250K - that is, if your bank fails, the government will give you up to $250K. That's plenty for most people, but I actually have a rich friend who splits his fortune among several banks for this reason.

The fee you pay affects how fast the tx is confirmed though, right? So it's not like there is "a fee", there's a range of fees for any given day. Sure, you might be paying more than you need to, but the *optimal fee* increases and decreases depending on various factors.
Again, if we look at that chart, the orange line is BTC per KB right? Fiat is not mentioned. And apart from those weird spikes in the early days, you can see that average fees on August 20 2017 were higher than at any other time - even slightly higher than September 2013.
Sorry, am I reading this wrong? I genuinely don't understand how you can think fees are not higher than they have been for the last 2-3 years?
Or are you just fixated on those big spikes? Which occurred in the days when hardly anyone (globally speaking) was messing around with Bitcoin?
Yes you are absolutely right to say that the size of the fees right now only hurts because one dollar buys such a small portion of a Bitcoin now. If 1.0BTC = $5, then who cares about 3 poofteeths of a cent versus 1 poofteenths of a cent.
But considering ONLY BITCOIN and ignoring fiat... the fees in August tripled. Didn't they?

While this common attitude is refreshing compared to the finance industry's "please consider if the product is right for you BUT YOU'RE NUTS IF YOU DON'T BUY BUY BUY AND GIVE ME 20%!"...
...its also not very useful. Anyone even browsing this subreddit is thinking, however abstractly, about spending some of their money on a thing that might make them money or might make them lose it.
If you have absolute zero tolerance for any kind of risk, then don't buy.
But people also need to remember that we are talking about making lots of money without doing any work - the trade-off is risk. If you don't accept SOME risk, you won't make any money.
It's really really great that everyone in this community prefaces every comment with "don't risk what you can't afford to lose / future gains the past under risk something something" but saying that no one should ever give their opinion about how/when to buy is just too extreme.
If a person is here, and posting, and reading replies, and buying BTC, and then turning around and saying "OMG I lost money!" then that is absolutely NOT our fault.

I do want to read up before getting into it any deeper, but remember "supply and demand" only works for everything, if spending power is distributed absolutely evenly. A hospital in a poor area simply couldn't survive on the incomes of its patients - it needs grants to remain solvent (and even that's not enough).


True, but you are comparing apples with... antibiotics? Developing economies of scale for food is relatively straightforward. The most expensive medicine almost by definition is needed by the fewest people. Economies of scale can't be establishing.
True, brutal economic rationalism applied to healthcare would see triage a far, far scarier place because you might get given a "red spot" which means "too expensive to treat." Sorry sir, your pulsating frontal lobe blastocytohaemotoma is only seen in 1 in every 10 million persons so we just can't justify the cost of researching you a cure. Off you go.
Anyway,  I shall read up anon... my broad understanding of the turn of the 20th is that is was a pretty awesome time if you were rich, white and too young or old to be asked to serve in WW1...

No, you can't just say it's a "misconception" as if that's a fact, you have to say "actually there's this view that lassez-fair capitalism was really good, and that government intervention messed up a good thing."
Again though, this guy and libertarians like him look at this problem through the lens of the people who benefited from previous badly designed systems. Almost no system disadvantages EVERYONE. For certain types of people in certain social situations, I'm sure the Gilded Age was perfectly awesome. 
Bottom line here tonight seems to be: you are prepared to let some people fall by the wayside rather than suffer any person inconvenience or disadvantage, ever. And I am not. And even if you say "well of course if I came across a man dying of thirst, I'd buy him a drink", that's actually a really inefficient way to run a society.
For instance, if you made a personal pledge (in a totally welfare-less state) to always buy food for any genuinely starving person who crossed your path, that would likely cost you far more than simply paying a little tax to support a welfare system. 
When all costs are input, welfare is cheaper than letting a destitute underclass build up in the alleys until they march on the Bastille and chop everyone's head off.
The only more economically efficient solution to inequality is to make vagrancy a capital offence, and to license childbirth. No money, no job, no prospects? You get the chop. Too dumb / no job / income too low? No baby.
I suspect such a callous social policy may have some... side effects.

Minus the admittedly almost nothingth of a dollar you would have earned in interest if you'd just banked it.

I chucked a snit at a donut shop because they were charging a flat 50 cents for all EFTPOS transactions. 50c flat. For my donut of the day, that was a 33% tax. I told the donutoid that was higher than GST. She just shrugged and said she wasn't the boss.
Looks like The Law is making it so while merchants in Aus can still charge fees, the fee can only be the actual cost of the transaction. So 33% for a donut is a no-no, but 1.7% or whatever is still okay.
I mean, I get it economically why a little shop doesn't want to eat the cost, but I still find it kind of funny how paying with EFTPOS or VISA at any large merchant in Australia actually SAVES you money, because a $9.99 payment gets rounded up to $10 if you pay cash.
But the same spend at a donut shop would cost you $10.45.

This is bad, but not as bad as the Aussie journalist who threw out a portable HDD with a 1400 BTC wallet on it.
Even if there's no way he would have hodled when the price got to $1K the first time and then crashed and then went back to $1K and then looked like it was going to crash again... that's still gotta hurt.

Okay let's step back from the brink a little here.
I am reading your post and I am under the impression that you are saying the US healthcare system used to be "financially efficient" or at least MORE financially efficient, but now it is not.
Obviously the ACA came in in 2010 so I am not sure what you mean by "the system prior to about a year ago was both the most financially efficient system and was the time when community support etc"?
You have to understand that from a non-US perspective, ALL the US healthcare systems look bad to us. If you are actually pro ACA, then sure that seems to be better than the system you had prior. 
Perhaps my use of the word "system" is confusing? When I say "ripping you off for decades" I mean the US healthcare and health insurance INDUSTRY. In this thread alone we have people telling stories of paying $600 to get their ears flushed out. America pays too much for health car - you pay via your taxes and then you get hit again via your hip pocket.
As a country, you pay a bigger proportion of your GDP per capita in healthcare costs than Australia does, and you get worse healthcare (with the exception of certain parts of your country that have the best and most advanced hospitals in the world).
This problem, of paying too much for healthcare, has been a feature of US society for a number of decades.

Remember that the value of fiat is mandated by a central bank. If you have $6000 in the bank, and you want to take it out, the law says the bank has to give you $6000 in cash, no messing about (there are of course many "except when..." scenarios, but you get the idea.)
If Bitcoin is sitting at $1m (we wish!) and everyone decides to cash out, only the first bunch of sellers are going to get that full $1m price. The more people sell, the more the price will drop.
But seriously, if your Bitcoin is worth $1m and it seems stable, why would you convert the whole lot into fiat? Fiat is only going to sit and shrink (unless you invest it in something else).
The reason banks have runs is that people are worried a deepening economic crisis is going to see all their money disappear. That can't happen with Bitcoin. People won't panic-sell in fear their entire stash is going to evaporate. They might sell off a bit because they think the price is going to drop below some limit they've set for themselves, but their selling is going to make other people go "woohoo buy the dips!"
A bank holding a trillion dollars in electronic money and only a million bucks in cash is bad because if everyone turns up and wants their cash, there isn't enough to go around. That simply doesn't apply to Bitcoin.
The WORST case for Bitcoin is that everyone gets bored with it or something better gets invented, so everyone cashes out over a period of days or weeks, and the idiots who didn't realise the game was over will end up with what they thought was a million-dollar fortune instead only getting them a few grand. And that will be bad, for them. Because life is tough. 
But there is never going to be a situation where every Bitcoin owner says to the US government "Hey, where's our 20 trillion dollars then?"
And even if bitcoin's value goes stupid insane and 1.0 BTC ends up worth (puts little finger to mouth) A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, then you'll still be able to buy 1 satoshi for a dollar, and similarly buy something worth a dollar with 1 satoshi.

Technical point: most exchanges have a lower limit (seems to be $8-$10?) that you can buy.
But the beauty of crypto is that you could - theoretically - find someone willing to transfer $1 of BTC to your wallet in exchange for cash "over the table."
Dangerous for BIG amounts of course - but for little amounts, it's probably okay.
Oh but each transaction attracts a fee and the size of the fee depends on network load, not "dollar value" of transaction. If you only gave $1 they would want you to pay the tx fee - which could be 20c... Or it could be $4!
Yeah. We're working on that...

It is likely (though not certain) that many people in the developing world, who live in countries where the local fiat is just a mess, will jump on Bitcoin as soon as the network gets fast enough (and tx fees are low enough). 
There are places where people risk jail and fines for using US dollars, because merchants just won't take the hyperinflated local fiat. Smuggling the greenbacks in is dangerous - Bitcoin is easy, and the local heavies can still get their cut via simple rubber-hose-assisted app transfer.
We rich Westerners are all paranoid about our security and mess around with wallets and whatnot, but an IT worker in Abuja on 110 mBTC a month will be happy just using an exchange app. 
In short: people only hodl if they can buy a decently sized position to start. Most of the world won't be able to do that, so for them Bitcoin will never be about rising value, it will be about being able to buy stuff without having to mess around with "illegal" currency or miss out on getting paid because the money printing machines at the central bank overheated from churning out so many trillion dollar bills...

Because so many people seem to think that the way exchanges handle crypto is somehow fundamentally different from how a modern bank handles fiat, and it's actually not that different.
I mean, you know this, right? Just like bitcoin, fiat currency is only "yours" if you have it in your possession. If you have a bank account, the money in it belongs to the bank, the bank has the money. The bank just lets you mess around with it via your account. The only way you can keep your money 100% safe from the bank is to take it out of the bank.
Oh sure the LAW says the money is yours, whoopdedoo. But then the economy gets in some kind of death spiral so the bank suspends transactions to prevent a run, and your money is locked up inside the bank.
Or the bank collapses, and you lose all "your" money except whatever amount the government guaranteed... if you happen to live in one of the countries with a government that guarantees bank accounts up to a certain amount (it's $250K in Australia).
At the moment it's far more likely for a crypto exchange to go bust or run off with all the coins, than it is for a bank to steal everyone's money, but that's just a matter of the market's lack of experience. This will change. Within 10 years, exchanges will be banks, fully regulated, accredited, whatever. 
And the only people saying "wooo don't keep your coins in the exchange!" will be like the crazies today who say "wooo don't keep your money in a bank!" Like... they have a fundamental point, sure, but it's an unnecessary layer of paranoia.
Still, at least with crypto, a hardware wallet is FAR more secure than keeping cash in a tin under your bed.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:50:00
What? No, I am talking specifically about how people think that because when "your" crypto is in an exchange and you don't have the private keys, then it isn't really yours.
This is true, but it's ALSO true of your money when it's in a bank account. Having your money in the bank is FUNDAMENTALLY the same as having your crypto on an exchange.
The bank has more rules and laws and whatnot preventing it from stealing your money, that's all.
Again: a bank account is really the bank saying "you can use some of our money whenever you want" in the same way that your balance on an exchange is "you can spend or send some of our Bitcoins whenever you want."
This is just about the coins-on-the-exchange thing, not the way crypto transactions work etc.
Not you, but many people think fiat money is somehow "more real" than Bitcoin, but it's only "more regulated" and, for now, "more predictable."

Healthcare needs to be a foundation of your society, not a "sector" for rent-seekers to make superprofits in. 
Healthcare shouldn't have to be constrained "within budget". You need to collect enough tax to pay for healthcare. It is essential. 
I suspect we need to blame the bloody Boomers for this situation, again. They are all retiring at 65 and living to 95 and the system wasn't designed with that in mind. There is a non-zero chance this problem may go away, because far from making Xers and Millennials delay their retirement to 75 or whatever, I suspect we are going to have a hard time making Xers and Millennials retire at all.
We may get another 15-20 years of tax from our own generations, and that might alleviate the strain on the system. 
I completely agree just chuffing along and not worrying about is inviting disaster, for ALL systems, no matter what they currently may be.

No, if you are about to die, you will be saved by the nearest medical professionals even if it is a private hospital. The government will pay.

The definition of what should or shouldn't be defined as "elective" is a different argument, and I am on board with you ESPECIALLY when it comes to conditions that cause chronic pain.
The big big hole in our medical tech as a civilisation is the lack of a "pain-o-mometer" where you point it at a person and say "OMG you're feeling pain at level 9 out of 10! Let's get you on a morphine drip stat!"
It's so weird because we all experience pain, yet when another person says to us "ow I'm in pain" we say "there there, now let ME decide if your pain is severe enough to justify medical intervention."
But the SYSTEM - where non-essential procedures are either put in a queue or left for the private insurers to handle - makes good sense. Not getting your knee fixed sucks, but how much worse would it be having to watch your child bleed out because theatre 1 is booked solid with knee reconstructions for the next sixteen hours?
In the specific case of geriatric joint reconstruction, quite simply we should all be paying more tax to fund our healthcare in later life. If we paid for "old age health care" then that money should be tied to building special geriatric hospitals, and every Australian should be entitled to a hip replacement when they need it. 
But no. We want to be able to buy big televisions in our 30s.

This is the thing, isn't it? If you had 1000 BTC in 2010, what sane person wouldn't have cashed out $30K in July 2011 just before the crash? Or $13K when it finally cracked ten bucks again in late 2012? If not, then SURELY $250K in April 2013? Or $130K, $100K, or $350K at various points later in 2013?
And if you'd somehow held your nerve through all of that, who wouldn't have cashed out an incredible $1.2 million in November 2013? And if they rode the subsequent crash down to $500-per-coin, who wouldn't have cashed out the instant their stake got back to $1 million since "Bitcoin always crashes after hitting $1000"?
If you didn't take your million in 2013, you would have had to spend the next THREE YEARS telling all your friends "no no, it will get back to $1000-a-coin eventually, you'll see" while they tease you as the millionaire-who-missed-the-boat.
And then when it hit $1.2 mil, or hell $2 million in May... or $3.2 million in June...
Seriously though, when did big numbers of people start to genuinely believe the price could go up past $3000, $4000, and even higher? I mean, I'm hodling to the moon, but has the community always believed it could even as high as it is right now?

I'm no fan of Coinbase's prices, but what exactly do you mean by "overcharge"? This whole shebang is totally unregulated right now, there is no "correct price". Plus they are a for-profit business, and when you do anything on the site, it's only possible because they paid to set everything up - it's perfectly ethical for them to charge "spread" or a fee of some kind.
And look, it's an exchange. Of COURSE they are going to round up or down by a fraction of a coin whenever they think they can get away with it, because all those little fractions add up over weeks and months.
At least with crypto you can see this happening and choose a new exchange if you want. Exactly the same thing (or worse) goes on with fiat all the time, and we KNOW it, but we can't see it, so it's hard to do anything about it!

In Australia MOST transfers between bank accounts are free but take at least a business day to clear, sometimes longer.
And "free" is disingenuous - most banks here charge a monthly account fee ($5 or so) just for having your money sitting there, unless you deposit at least $2000 a month.
As for solving problems, in the short term at least Bitcoin DEFINITELY solves MY problem of when I give my savings to my bank, they get to use them to lend money and make interest, but they pay me precisely 2.8 % of fuck all for the privilege.

This really is dotcom 2.0. Has there been an ICO yet where the designers state "our system is specifically designed to solve the final problem with money - uncertainty caused by transactions. Since you can never know when someone is going to send a token to someone else, and what effect this will have on the value of your own tokens, we have designed a exploit-proof system that prevents transactions. Once the initial 450 trillion ImvblOBJ coins are mined, they will be permanently assigned to specific addresses in the blockchain and can never be moved. We think this is the future of money.

Let's pretend 1.0BTC gets to US$1million.
1 Satoshi = 1 cent. 
100 Satoshi = 1 dollar. A Big Mac will cost a few hundred sats.
1 mBTC = 1000 dollars. A car will cost 30-50 mBTC or "em-bits". A smartphone will cost 0.5 or 0.7 em-bits. A big TV maybe 2 or 2.5.
I think having a unit of currency where "1.0" equals a million dollars in today's money is quite useful. A three bedroom suburban house will be worth 0.5, a mansion 2.2. 
All the rest is just slang which will emerge organically like it always does.

They can't "make their own". Bitcoin is a finite resource. Who knows how much BTC is in DPRK hands, but it's NOT even a significant minority. None of us really "make" a Bitcoin, we enable it on the blockchain for transactions. There are only 4.4 million left to mine, and the difficulty keeps doubling as you know, so as a way to generate "something from nothing" (which isn't even true anyway) it's going to get reeeallly slooooow.
They will spend way way more on electricity than they get out of Bitcoin.
And once they spend one, how are they going to get another one? It's a one time thing for them at best. So they mine a few thousand, let's be generous and say they mine 100,000BTC and hodl until the value is $50,000-per BTC.
That's five billion dollars - for a country like North Korea, that's the equivalent of us being giving 18 months of salary. Sure, nice, but you wouldn't quit work on just 18 months of salary, right?
And let's not forget - they can only spend it once. And if they try to spend too much of it at once, the value will go down. Once they spend a BTC, how can they possibly get another one? They won't be able to buy it!
Even a million BTC  (which they won't get) will only last them a decade or so. Could they use it to finance a global spy network, or develop sleeper cells or whatever? Sure I guess, but they already do that with fiat - both real and counterfeit.
I just don't see how DPRK "owning" any BTC will change anything.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:48:58
It's interesting how the skepticism is changing though. Not even six months ago, this guy would have been writing "Bitcoin is nothing, it's fairy floss funny money, nobody uses it or will ever use it, the traditional systems all do the same thing better blah blah."
Now they're shifting to "Okay so it's real, but it's worth way way less that you think it is."
Presumably when one coin is worth $100K they will say "The failure of government to something something means we live in a permanent bubble that could pop any time..."
And finally they will say "With Bitcoin now valued at US$1.2 million per coin, civilisation has simply replaced the last generation of oligarchs with a new generation who are far worse because they didn't even have the decency to inherit an oil company from daddy."
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:30:40
But... do you see that in terms of functional language, there is no difference between saying "ONE million-dollars" and "ONE bit-coin"?
For a long long time, nobody bought groceries with DOLLARS, they bought them with CENTS. They took the dollar and cut it up into 100 bits and gave those bits a new name - the cent.
This is exactly the same as Bitcoin (except there are 100 million pieces per Bitcoin).
Right now when you buy Bitcoin, you don't buy it in neat round amounts (unless you are anal and have a calculator), you put in $100 and get, as of tonight, 0.02292BTC. Right now we find that hard to read, hard to understand whether having one zero after the decimal point and then a number means "lots of money" or "not much money".
But I've half-trained myself already to know that 0.01 is $50, 0.001 is $5 and 0.0001 is 50c. (for now, it will change). So when I'm doing a transaction and considering the fee, I know if there are three zeroes after the decimal point, the fee will be $5 or less and if there are FOUR zeroes then the fee isn't worth worrying about. (It's all 5s for me because I don't work in USD and 1.0BTC is 5000-ish in my fiat.)
We've grown up with "lots" of money being written as a number, then a comma, then three zeroes, then three more zeroes. All that's changing is the comma is becoming a decimal point.
1.000000 is the same as 4,400.000 (in USD, more or less). Simple as that. I get the 1 turning into a 4 is confusing right now, but when BTC hits 10,000, then reading your wallet value will get a bit more intuitive.

The money in the bank these days is only "yours" because regulation makes sure the bank can't just take it all off your for no reason - but there's nothing PHYSICALLY stopping them doing that. 
And sure Bitcoin fees are annoying at the moment, but some banks charge you $5 a month unless you are doing a certain number of transactions...
...but if you do too many transactions, the bank will charge you a fee for that as well.
But I suppose they do need that fee-money... to pay for the constant barrage of mailouts cajoling us into signing up for a credit card with a 21% interest rate.

I am Australian, nimrod. This country is not a shit hole, but you are correct that whingers constantly go on about how expensive everything is but actually our food is pretty cheap, our petrol is kind of middle-priced by global standards, and not having to fork out some huge percentage of your salary on health insurance is something you really notice if you have to go and work in the US. (Houses are very expensive though, no argument there.)
As for "queue jumping," the private health care system here is a  separate queue, you ain't jumping shit. The point of universal healthcare is that so when life dumps on you unexpectedly, you don't get left to die. 
You think it's all about major surgery and cancer meds, but it's really about day to day shit. I got slammed into someone on the train and my bloody earbud tip got lodged deep in my ear canal. I went to the nearest medical centre, showed my medicare card, waiting 10 minutes, a doctor came out, took a look, got a pair of forceps out of a sterilised bag, pulled out the earbud tip and said see ya.
I walked out without paying a cent, and the government gave that doc something like $30, $40 for the five minutes of her time my 'procedure' took.
What would that have cost in the US? Cost of "consult". Cost of "instrument retrieval". Cost of "sterilisation and preparation" (even though it was already sterilised). Cost of "disposal of biowaste" (the gross earbud tip with my wax on it). Etc etc etc. A couple of hundred bucks?
Getting jostled on the train could have completely ruined my month, budget-wise, if it had happened in the US and I had no insurance, or the wrong insurance, or whatever.
Seriously man, living in a society where you know if you get actual bubonic plague somehow, the government will just give you a course of antibiotics, simply removes an entire layer of stress from day-to-day living.
But whatever, it's a shithole, regulation is prima facie bad, etc.

Yeah this is what happens when an open source project gets international recognition.
While you're talking about the Bitcoin cash fork, which is itself NOT a company, I think the real confusion for ordinary folks is going to be trying to choose an exchange, wallet etc.
I find it incredibly cynical of companies who create parasite brands like "Bitcoin.com" or "Blockchain.info" because their entire strategy is to "trick" people into thinking they are the "official" Bitcoin - though an official Bitcoin, by definition, does not exist.
Here in Australia you tend to see this whenever the government gives some service a new name. We got an online tax return system a while back, called eTax, and a company jumped in and named itself etax.com.au because the govt hadn't trademarked it or something.
Similarly, our capital city Canberra has a young driver licensing system called Road Ready. I learned to drive from a driving instructor who had registered his company as Road Ready. He was quite open about it, saying he did it because the govt hadn't bothered to lock down the name.
Personally, I refuse to deal with any company that tries to operate like this. I don't need a bunch of sly cynics handling my dough.

The instruction, as written, is not specific or detailed enough, that's what's wrong with it. Some people will leave their coins on an exchange and just write down their username and password. Some will manage to figure out a paper wallet, and then just put it in with all their other important documents ie the first place a thief is going to look.
if Bitcoin does what all us hodlers hope it's going to do and ends up being worth $100K+ a coin, you can bet there will be big business in burglarising paper wallets from people who don't understand that they should be keeping them in a goddamn safety deposit box (if their balance is high enough).

I don't want to come across as gloating but as an Australian, the procedure you just described would have cost me... NOTHING.
To be fair, the prescription antibiotics would have cost about $20, but I'm smart enough to know that antibiotic don't do shit to the flu, but supposed you might have had a hint of a bacterial respiratory infection or something...
Minimum wage in Australia is about $35K per year which means your total medicare bill would be $700. For total care. Sure you'll be jammed in a public ward with a bunch of weirdos, but $700!
Oh, and if you are on minimum wage and have kids? The government will probably give you money. You will have a negative total tax bill.
Australia be like "Maybe if we make sure the poor can buy stuff, the economy won't crash?"
It's not perfect - dodgy bosses mean we have our own underclass of "working poor" and there are more and more people being paid cash-in-hand which sucks. But if you end up in hospital having never held a medicare card, at the end of the stay you aren't presented with a $45,000 bill, you're presented with a bunch of paperwork. and then you get a medicare card in the mail.
Again, it's not perfect and we are facing some, um, long term issues around funding the bloody thing. But what happened to you just doesn't happen here, ever.
If someone in Australian goes bankrupt because of illness, it's because their arsehole boss fired a person for having cancer.

Actually one of the beauties of Bitcoin is that you can buy it in 100-millionth increments (well, exchanges have a minimum buy at $8-$10, but you know what I mean). So all that matters is the percentage increase after you buy.
Spending $1000 now and cashing out once BTC increases by 200% is exactly the same as spending $1000 next year and cashing out when BTC goes up by another 200%.
I guess the risk is that at some point it will find some kind of natural level, and the higher it gets the more likely it will settle down and plateau for long periods.
The reason to "rush" in now is because the COST-to-risk ratio is still quite reasonable, and "normies" can still reasonably buy an entire Bitcoin without having to commit their entire life savings. I mean, the thought of losing $4500 in a flash does produce a kind of vertigo, but it's still "DAMN!" money, rather than "I'm ruined!" money.
And anyway, all us latecomers can be all smug at the Country Club with all the other Bitcoin Millionaires and say "Oh yeah? Well I actually risked REAL MONEY for this, not like you, Mr I-Bought-$25-Of-BTC-In-2010-To-Piss-Off-My-Roomate."

I don't think it's reasonable to compare today's fees with those massive spikes. The giant spike on "week of December 11 2011" for instance, was caused by people experimenting on the network:
Dear God those numbers...
I wonder how the miner who got the big payout feels now, or if they dumped the coins themselves... haha. There must be so many crazy stories from the early days. 
2012-2013 was the last time fees were comparably high, and that was the crazy time that gave Bitcoin it's reputation for super volatility - $350 one day, $100 the next, $500 the next, $1000 by the end of the month then back down to $300 again etc etc.
But not only that, in 2012-2013 many, many fewer people were mining and transacting. The way commerce is supposed to work, the more people are using a network, the cheaper it is supposed to get per person. Economies of scale, see?
But Bitcoin's system is all about getting a place in a queue, so the more transactions, the longer the queue, the more demand, the higher the cost of jumping to the front of the queue.
You are correct that fiat is now worth much less compared to a Bitcoin, but the problem is fiat still has considerable purchasing power. Yes you are correct to say $100 has "crashed" down to just 0.02 BTC, but out on the street $100 still buys me quite a lot of stuff.
Again though, just because fees have been "as high" in the past, does not mean today's fees are not high! You yourself are saying that fees are about as high as they were in 2013... but only on a couple of occasions. The average fee throughout that period was quite a bit lower.
Fees have been climbing all this year apart from some relief we suddenly got in July, and then they jumped right back up again. Let's hope the current easing off continues.

You gotta get over hating tax because it's tax and look at the net cost. In Australia I pay less than $2000 a year for healthcare. So it's through tax, who cares?
Almost everyone in Australia pays less for healthcare than you guys do in the US. Only the mega mega rich declare incomes so high that 2% equals more than what they would have to pay for private healthcare, and even then they will be paying less overall for healthcare than the equivalently rich person in the US.
Nobody is getting robbed. Everyone pays less for healthcare here. Everyone. (Yeah okay, we don't get the option to say "no healthcare please I will run the risk of a full-fee, no-subsidy medical bill because I am a superman and will never get sick or hurt myself ever.")

It's a worry but not in a "OMG they are using all our electricity!" way. Electricity doesn't get "used up" of course.
The amount of power used doesn't matter, only whether or not that power is being diverted from more essential things and how polluting/consumptive the generators are, matters.
With a bit of luck, Bitcoin and other crypto/blockchain/post-blockchain networks will provide a strong economic incentive to develop larger renewable power systems.
The worry I think is that so many of these Chinese mining farms... there seems to be no way they can possibly pay off the cost of their infrastructure. Even with free electricity and lord knows what bribes etc. Even at a million dollars a coin. Because they need to keep adding more hardware faster than the price of each BTC increases, AND they are facing "the halvening" where the block reward drops from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC, in 2020.
So we are probably going to have at least one or two major "disruptions" to the network in the next, I dunno, year or two, as we wait for major microelectronics companies to build hardware that runs Bitcoin efficiently.
I think we're in the "filthy 19th century industrial revolution, get the machines running and who cares about child labour laws" stage of crypto, as a technology. 
I think it will get better, cleaner, more efficient. It's just a matter of how painful the transition will be.

That is exactly the point I am making. The point is that, if we were talking about flat screen TVs, it would be really really weird if the more people who bought flat screen TVs, the more expensive the TVs became. 
So we are used to things getting cheaper the larger the pool of people using them and this applies to services too. Cities where the public transport carries tens of millions of people generally (not always, but generally) have cheaper tickets.
Amazon's shipping costs (generally, not always) are cheaper than buying the same product from an independent online store, because the indie has to pay for a courier while Amazon does so much business with couriers it gets a special rate.
So Bitcoin is weird to most people because the fees go up when the network is heavily loaded. It makes sense IF YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. But most people don't.
However, you are trying to tell us that fees aren't high because a) they have been higher, relative to the BTC in the past and b) because 1.0BTC is now worth a lot of fiat.
I'm saying fees ARE high because Bitcoin doesn't follow the same rules as other networks. And by network I don't mean "computer network" I mean "a system that allows value and output to move between people".
Your different perspective is WRONG and (at least at the time you made the first post) Bitcoin fees were objectively high. There is no way to look at those fees and decide that really what has happened is that fiat has crashed.
FIAT HAS NOT CRASHED.

Please, please try to understand. Just because fees were even higher at some point in the past does not mean fees today are not high. Come on. Please.

@_date: 2017-11-21 12:53:42
The answer isn't very straightforward I don't think. There seem to be estimates floating around based on the *value* of an average transaction but Bitcoin itself doesn't know anything about *value*, it only knows about the size of a transaction in bytes.
As you know, a transaction is completed (or confirmed) when it is "mined" into a block and becomes part of the blockchain forever.
So electricity "used" by a transaction would have something to do with how big the tx is in bytes, which means it will take up a certain percentage of a block.
Each day a certain number of blocks get mined and a certain amount of electricity is consumed, so you'd think dividing those would give "electricity per block" and then you figure out the average number of txs per block and there's the answer.
But blocks aren't just mined for the sake of confirming transactions, they're also mined to get the block reward (currently 12.5 BTC). That's still the main incentive for mining at all...
So perhaps it would be more fair to look at what percentage of mining revenue comes from transactions vs the block reward, then divide the electricity usage by THAT.
As far as I can tell for now, transactions provide miners with about 12% of their revenue (maybe this has changed recently though). So we should only be looking at 12% of the electricity cost per block.
Remember: if there were no block rewards, far fewer people would bother mining because there's no money in it. With fewer miners, the difficulty would adjust downward, and the electricity usage would fall.
Does anyone know the MINIMUM number of nodes Bitcoin would need to run transactions-only, at this stage?

Ugh that page.
The way they compare Bitcoin (a complete, self-contained monetary system) with VISA (a layer on a layer on a monetary system) is really irritating!
The way they work out cost per transaction seems to be along the lines of: work out value of transactions per day then divide that by energy use per day on the assumption that 5 cents of operational costs = 1 kWh consumed or something? 
Obviously that site has an agenda to push the idea that Bitcoin "wastes electricity"... for some reason.
The REAL answer has to be "it depends" because it's surely to do with the size of the transaction in bytes which means it takes up a certain percentage of the block it is confirmed into?

Not sure that's totally clear-headed analysis.
Markets follow money, not convenience. Cost increases on transactions are trivial to the players who have enough BTC to make the market shift.
Alternate theory: both instances, ETH and BCH were offering much faster increases in value in percentage terms, and it's extraordinarily easy (and cheap) for investor to switch their coins from BTC to ETH to BCH and back.
If BCH goes up 5% in an hour while BTC is kind a footling about, why WOULDN'T you jump over there and then do exactly what happened: dump the shit out of it once you'd doubled your money?
I don't doubt that fools and wastrels thought this was "chain death" for BTC both times, though.

Never feel stupid. Your purchase added "support" to $7500 in some small way. You spent real money on real Bitcoin, it wasn't a "future" or some kind of paper book-cooking bullshit like happens so often in the stock market.
You still have your 0.0373 BTC (or maybe a little less because fees, right?). 
Another way to look at it is this. As I write, the price on Coinbase is .. huh, 7001.01 (cute).
That means your 0.0373 BTC is still worth $261.

Yeah man, it's gonna be tough. It could be DAYS before the price gets back up there :).
Seriously though, this might seem like an obvious thing to say but, you haven't lost any BTC just because its value relative to the dollar has fallen, right?
If you bought $7500 worth of BTC, then "losing" $550+ right away feels bad man, sure, but you still have 1.0BTC right? And you didn't think $7500 was going to be the highest price EVER, right?
So all you've really "lost" so far is the opportunity to have bought more BTC  for the same amount of money. Shrug. Such is life.
In this adventure the number one rule is this: never do anything that leaves you with LESS BTC than you had before (except in cases where you are converting that BTC to cool shit like Lamborghinis!).

Perhaps not flawed, but just not very detailed.
**Lower fees more uses.**
It does stand to reason but... is this something the market actually wants? We have fiat to throw away on everyday mini- and microtransactions. I suspect demand for an alternative everyday payment system to fiat is not yet especially strong.
**More uses equals more users**
Again, most people in the societies most likely to be well educated about BTC right now don't really have any problems with their "pocket money". Fiat works fine for buying coffee.
**Safe haven, easy haven**
What the market DOES want is a safe haven for savings. Banks are considered predatory, putting profits before people. Gold is difficult to deal with and hard to turn into fiat quickly. Bank accounts that offer anything but laughable interest require money to be "locked away" for a period. There is a demand for a way of storing wealth that does not involve giving your money to a corporation of some kind, paying fees to simply have your money sitting in a vault, and also gives quick and easy access to those savings when/if needed.
**Mostly speculation**
Too many people are actually paying (as of right now) $8240 for 1.0 BTC or portion thereof for this to be 100% true. Real bullshit speculation is when books get cooked and numbers get massaged to make everybody "buy" crazy futures and options without any actual money changing hands. When it comes to BTC, actual money changes hands. Is the price 100% correlated to the actual amount of *work* put into the economy, then into fiat, then into BTC? No of course not. But the price bear deeper analysis than "it's speculation".
**More users = higher price**
I simply do not believe that any person who is just hearing about BTC now or just now deciding to act because they realised their $100,000 inheritance is being nibbled to death by inflation, will look into BTC and say "wait, forget the 4% CC fee on Coinbase, or the 3% buy-sell spread on other exchanges, or the differences in price between this exchange, that exchange, the place I get my BTC and the price I get when I google BTC price... what really turns me off is the way that if I'm not careful I could end up paying $5 to send $10,000 to my sister in Prague!"

Oh the last post. What does guarantee mean? It means if you risked $1000 and lost it, I would have paid you $1000.
So, over the period 2013 to 2017, Bitcoin did not suffer a net loss. So  if I had guaranteed your $1000, I would not have had to pay you out. Fact.
Your question about "zero chance of going down" is imprecise. Did Bitcoin "go down" at various times during that period? Yes. But the net result was a gain.
Again, you're writing here in 2017 trying to assign "chance" to a single event with a single outcome. If we had 10 guys who all bought in 2010 and held to 2017, and 3 of them went bust and 7 made money, we can say the "chance" of making money 2010-2017 was 7:3.
But the fact is that EVERYONE who bought and held Bitcoin 2010-2017 made money. So the chance of making money 2010-2017 if you bought-and-held Bitcoin was 100%.
I know I know, you want to assuage your disappointment at not investing a large amount in, say, June, by telling yourself that anyone who did invest big without knowing today's result was an "idiot".
But how is doing that going to help you increase your rate of return? Instead of dismissing "big winners" as "idiots who got lucky", why not investigate what it was that made them confident enough to invest big, at that time?
Why don't millions of people take the same risk as this guy? Because they are too afraid of risk. That's not idiotic either. But in this case, if the desired outcome is "make a lot of money", then the decision to NOT put a lot of money in Bitcoin in 2010 (argh, or 2013, sorry I keep getting the start date mixed up, fortunately when it comes to Bitcoin it doesn't matter!) was wrong.
Let me complicate my point by instead looking at people who CASHED OUT in, say 2014. Was it "idiotic" to cash out when Bitcoin was going to climb all the way to $5000 from (depending on the month) $750?
No it's not idiotic, because every single person who had decided not to cash out at $1200 was holding Bitcoins worth $750. Cashing out in 2014 merely turned out to be wrong.
Do you see the difference? It's important. Calling someone's decision "idiotic" means you are dismissing it as not worth analysis. If you call it "wrong" then you can analyse why it was wrong and improve YOUR decision making.

Dude, think about it. We both deposit $1000, which means they now have $2000. They charge us both 1%, so we get Bitcoin currently valued at $990.
Then Bitcoin goes up by 10%. We now have Bitcoin worth $1089 - or $2178 - but they still only have $2000. 
We cash out, demanding our $2178. If they just handed it all over, they would end up $178 in the red. Instead they charge us 1.5%, so they only pay out $2145.33, keep the $32.67 gain, leaving them $145.33 in the red.
Now, obviously lots of people are buying in and out at different times and values, but the bottom line is, if they offered their services for free, or even for deposit fee only, they'd slowly run out of money and shut down.

The 36K wouldn't be so bad if you had awesome roads and a free tram to downtown and every kid in your neighbourhood went to a free school and every time you had a weird cough you just popped in to the local medical centre and they checked you out and you only had to pay like $20 for antibiotics.
So don't get me wrong. While I very much believe in the CONCEPT of tax, I very much agree that most governments right now misuse it (or at best, fail to use it effectively because they're afraid of special interest groups and would rather have no medical centre at all rather than get accused of giving "abortions on demand" or something.)

If you earn over $140K, you have to pay 1.5%.

**Don't Invest More Than You Can Lose** is chiseled on the lintel of the doorway to this sub. 
Nobody here says spend 80% of what you're worth on Bitcoin, and any time someone posts "woo I just mortgaged my grandmother for BTC!" the response is ALWAYS "dude... balls... but you're an idiot."
What's annoying YOU about this sub is that everyone's not screaming "SELL SELL SELL!" and not everyone is a daytrader, and not everyone thinks the risk of mistiming the dip and losing not just money but BITCOINS by not having enough fiat to  buy back in again, is worth it.
The point with Bitcoin is that a dip doesn't lose ANY of your "capital"... if you consider your BTC to be capital. So people are just curious to see who else thinks like that.
Obviously you are in the school of thought that says Bitcoin will never be a reserve, or act like a reserve, or if it does it will take so long it's no worth waiting for.
Most people here don't believe that. Most of us aren't expecting Bitcoin to give us INCOME all year. So we just want to buy as much as we can and wait.
Crystal ball gazing but, I am very certain that anyone who leaves now and messes up buying back in and so ends up, by the end of the year, with less BTC than they wanted, will strongly regret it.

Well dude you do you, but the beauty of Bitcoin compared to a stock or whatever is that it CAN crash down to $0 and then recover. There's no corporation that has to remain solvent or whatever. 
But if the price drops seriously low, there's a chance your exchange may no longer be able to operate. They need those percentages to keep the lights on. And 1% of fuck all is, well, fuck all and they will go bust.

For something to be an "opportunity cost" it requires an unknown outcome, by definition. If you know that one of two choices will give a higher NET benefit, why the fuck would you choose the other one?! (Note I said "net" benefit, so you can't say "oh because maybe somewhere else, you would get...")
The "binary choice" of buying or selling is elastic. You don't need to pick the precise high and the precise low to make profit. And every choice is NOT a roll of the dice. Markets have momentum. Big dips don't reverse suddenly at any moment, they reverse near specific prices.
I get it. You hate to admit that a lot of people were smart. They saw the dip the other week and sold out as the downward momentum picked up. And then when they saw it pause at $3000-ish and start to shoot straight back up, they quickly bought back in and the end result was they had more BTC now.
Hell, that's a part of WHY the price recovered so fast. Everyone already saw $3000-per-coin as a bargain, and hardly anybody expected it (or wanted it) to fall lower. So they bought back in.
Yes, that doesn't mean it won't fall lower than $3000 again. But a market isn't random. We know that if there's going to be another big dip, it's likely to happen when the Chinese exchanges are (or are not?) finally shuttered. Or when the 2X fork does or doesn't happen.
It's extremely unlike to happen, say, right now. Remember, as a market, BTC is biased toward accumulating more BTC. It's not like a share or something where people are like "woohoo I've made a million, I'm off to the Caymans!" Even dudes with stacks worth tens of millions are still trying to buy more BTC.
Can we every PRECISELY predict a market? Of course not. Do we need to, to profit from one? Look around. A LOT more people make a million from messing around with trades, than they do playing the lottery dude.

Minus exchange fees, minus capital gains tax, minus any bank transfer fees etc you clear a solid $350. (I'm guessing, point is there will be costs so you will clear less than $400.)

You're making a little joke but in fact BTC is a boon for weed sellers. You meet your guy wherever, you both pull out your smartphones, do the tx, and then both walk away. In fact, why even meet? But if you do need that face to face feel, cops watching are just doing to see two people on smartphones. 
Later on, someone drops your weed in the agreed place.
No one is running around down with fat stacks of cash, no one is running around with bags of green. 
What's that? Don't trust your dealer to actually drop the goods after your tx? Well, make a fuss. He won't be a dealer for long, and the guys above him, if THEY want to last, will make it right.

No he could not have lost his house because Bitcoin grew in price between 2013 and 2017.
I don't understand why you think there is some random element to this. There isn't. If you didn't buy Bitcoin back in 2013, then you made the wrong choice, simple as that. (I made the wrong choice, and I can admit that.)
As I said to the other guy, it's not like buying 100BTC in 2013 gave you a 50-50 chance of winning a prize. It gave you a 100% certainty of having about $50,000 worth of BTC today. Just because they didn't know that at the time doesn't change the fact that this was a sure bet.
There is no random element here. Only an UNKNOWN element. It is not idiotic to make a choice when you don't know the outcome. NOTHING we do is certain. I work all month on the expectation my boss will pay me at the end, but the company could go bust before then. Am I an idiot for not working for money up front?
I know it seems counter-intuitive but from where we are standing now, NOT buying Bitcoin was the "idiotic" decision. Bitcoin could have made you a millionaire from an input of just $25. 
Adjust your justifications for not believing in Bitcoin earlier. Admit you didn't think it could be this big, or you didn't realise what seems obvious now - in a world where fiat currencies are inflating into nothingness and nobody can earn shit on high interest deposits, there will be a demand for something else.
ETA: You will say "urgh but you can't say that it was a 100% bet from the perspective of someone in 2013." Sure. Like right now we can't say BTC will 100% go to one million. BUT WE AREN'T SPEAKING IN 2013. We're speaking now. We don't exist in all times and all places. It is perfectly valid to say "wow that guy really believed in Bitcoin and his belief paid off" in the same way it's valid to say "haha those poor chumps who sold at $1000!!".
There is no random chance in this journey. Every rise and fall is caused by human decisions. Not all of them will be made in good faith, but there is no random element at play.

Yes sorry, this thread is specifically about whether or not MERCHANTS can benefit from BTC. So any mention of fees is in the context of the merchant fees.
Have you seen them? They are terrible! Shops have to pay $50, $80, $100 or more a month depending on how much money they get in transactions!
For a shop, a VISA machine is like a data plan on a smartphone. They pay a base amount, and if they go over, they have to pay like 1.5% per additional transaction.
Actually, I think it's the BANK that charges them this, while VISA makes it's money from the banks? Not sure on that...

The correct answer is:
"Now I have built my factory in Dongguang and have a good supply source of plastic, and a license to export, I can make anything to sell to America. What shall I make? 
Perhaps I shall make some plastic money. I have heard of this, and I know American children play with plastic money in their dollhouses and pretend shops - and after all I am also making a plastic cash register. This will be a good product to support my other product."
"And there is a lot of criticism right now that plastic toys are not good, and we must restore faith in the Made in China brand. I attended a trade show last week where they said making EDUCATIONAL toys was the future."
"So I shall brand my plastic money as suitable for education, and I will include it in the next shipment because the deal I have with the distributor in America is to sell plastic toys by the tonne, not by the specific kind of toy."

No seriously, by inflation alone, $500 invested at the rate of inflation in 1882 would now be worth over $11,300. 
Which means today $500 buys what about $22 would have bought in 1882.
So if you had $500 in 1882 and just kept it under the bed,  you'd be pretty disappointed with how little it could buy today compared to what it could buy in 1882. (Also, you are a time traveller or immortal).
Unless the fiat you hodled was this precise one, with Abe's pic on it. Since once sold for $2.4 million at auction.

No, we're arguing about what Bitcoin is capable of doing vs what it is actually doing right now.
Right now it is acting as a store of value, a speculative investment, and a currency.
Just because you rarely use BTC to buy things directly doesn't mean that other people aren't. I do. I already prefer to pay for online purchases worth $100+ in Bitcoin because merchants almost universally offer substantial discounts agains the fiat value of the goods.
This is what no one seems to take into account, the fact that merchants DON'T automatically gouge *individuals* for the maximum amount, they gouge the *market*. If Bitcoin pricing at 80% of fiat pricing results in a 100% increase in sales... *everybody wins*.
I know that's an alien concept these days, but it does still happen from time to time.
If you look at the really big big picture of the history of human economic systems, any given person today is *potentially* far far better off than their ancestors. Yes, some of use are still oppressed, but there is a BIG difference between: "People starve to death because we can't produce enough calories" and "People starve to death because we can't distribute calories efficiently." You think farmers WANT 30% of their produce thrown out? Or would they rather be able to raise their prices by, say, 15% because the wholesalers can charge more because the retailers know they will sell 100% of their stock?
And so it goes...

And how would that prove that people who get excited at the potential of things are always wrong?
I am not opposed to measured discussion on the probabilities of what Bitcoin will eventually be. But we are at the stage when anyone who says “OMG OMG it’s gonna get LN and and like smart contract stuff and and OMG and one sat will be worth one dollar and and wow and...” gets mocked.
The point of Bowie is not to show that all enthusiastic predictions are automatically right, of course they’re not. 
But I think we are at a point now where it’s worth NOTING who says crazy optimistic things, because - as Bowie here shows - in the long run, usually ONE of those crazy optimists ends up accidentally predicting what will really happen.

I genuinely do not give a shit about anything Kim Jong-un thinks. The *status quo* is so thoroughly fucked that even our evil totalitarian dictators are a fucking joke.
Say what you like about Stalin and Hitler, they did not spend their days ranting against the free world, and then rush into a secret room and watch Daffy Duck films (actually I think that was Kim Jong-il, but you get the idea).
Kim's actions and bluster are not directed at us. It's all directed at his OWN PEOPLE. Kim's ridiculous threats and semi-fake missile tests are all for the benefit of the underdog factions in his military.
The strain on the regime internally right now must be extraordinary. Kim Jong-il wasn't half the man Kim Il-sung was, and Kim Jong-un is even less capable. DPRK is full of genuine hardcase murderbot psycho post-Stalinist generals, each with their own collection of troops loyal to THEM. The unity is a pretence, enforced at the end of an electric cattle-prod.
They must look at Kim Jong-un and think, goddamn this is what it has come to. This fat kid with no idea. Kim Jong-un can only "inspire" his people because he's already the boss, but can you imagine him trying to START the current system, like his grandfather did? Even with Soviet backing?

*sigh* Why must everyone be so silly all the time...
In a situation where all the banks have failed and paper money is worthless, people will still want to trade. We still want to eat, we still want shelter etc.
Traditionally we would have used gold, but that requires tools to bust up your bullion AND it usually requires brokers too.
Bitcoin just needs a rump of the internet to survive, and a bunch of computers "mining" to ensure transactions go through.
If there's internet, if you have access to a device that can use the internet, and there are enough computers (or ASICs or whatever) mining, then Bitcoin will just work.
In that world, you will go to market and say "I want a cabbage" and the guy will say "7 satoshi per cabbage" and you will say "what! No wait, 5 sat." And he will say "6 is the best I can do" and then you will say okay, and I suspect you will exchange some little tokens that represent 100-millionths of a bitcoin and once a day or a week or whatever, you will go to the Bitcoin place and they will charge you a nominal fee to turn your tokens into "real" Bitcoin which gets sent to or removed from your wallet.
Point is, in the event of a near-total collapse, Bitcoin will wait patiently for us to get enough internet infrastructure back up to mine and do transaction. All the practical day-to-day stuff will be improvised as we go.
Ultimately, even without a collapse, I suspect we will one day all be carrying "crypto-fiat" which are tokens or notes issued by Bitcoin exchanges, and lots of people will get screwed.
And so then government will create central Bitcoin exchanges, and only the central exchange will be allowed to issue legal crypto-fiat, but it's all Backed by Bitcoin, right? The govt will have to hold the equivalent amount of Bitcoin to how many notes are in circulation...
...and then maybe 70, 80 years later some government will say having money pegged to Bitcoin is really annoying so they will "float" their crypto-currency...
...and this is where we came in.

And wilfully ignoring it is equally bad. You should consider all implications of everything you do, don't just stick your fingers in your ears and say "lalalala not listening!"
It is a FACT that someone bought pizzas with 10,000 BTC and it's a FACT that today 10,000 BTC can be converted back to about $37 million dollars, market permitting.
And it's also important to acknoweldge that buying the pizza was probably really really vital to establishing Bitcoin as a viable cryptocurrency. An important bit of positive propaganda, if you will.
Same with all those people who used BTC to buy Diablo 3 items or iPads or whatever. Like the people who FOMOed in at $4900, they are all an important part of the story and we shouldn't ignore any of them.

Sigh. Well there's a couple of way to engage with this. One is to point out that I didn't say anything about the Paris Agreement because, much like you seem to do, I don't put much faith in governments responding to the issue.
But perhaps its time for you to actually forward what you think the response should be. Like, what should we do? What should be the response to the following situations:
1. Climate change is not anthropogenic and not happening.
I can't really see how it's possible to claim that NO climate change is happening, but sure, maybe humans have nothing at all to do with it. How should we respond? 
2. Climate change is not anthropogenic and IS happening.
We hear some say "oh the climate has always changed". I don't really get why we should then just lie back and let the planet kill us, but whatever. What's the most effective response in a world where the climate IS changing but NOT because of us?
3. Climate change is real and caused primarily by humans.
For me, I hope it is caused by humans because that means we have some chance of fixing it. But what would you do?

Consider - if you buy your coins at a price you like, and you move them to a hardware wallet, then there is NOTHING Wall St can do to you.
Bitcoin is it's own thing. It doesn't need to be money to survive, it's a network with tokens that can be transacted to different addresses. That's all.
There's no company to go bust. Bitcoin doesn't have to keep a certain level of liquidity or income going to operate. 
JP Morgan can crash the price down to $0 tonight, and then either they or someone else can pump it back up again and it makes no difference to your coins.
It will be a problem if, on the day you want to actually spend you coin for something like a car or a house, the big boys have crashed it down 20% for some reason.
But in the long term they are NOT going to hold it down. They force it down to trick you into selling. If you own your coins outright, you have no debt on them, then simply do not sell.

Okay so you're part of the "BTC isn't already widespread so therefore it will never be widespread" crowd, are you?
The question was: what is good for a merchant about Bitcoin. Not: can a merchant ditch all other forms of payment today and only accept Bitcoin.
That said, there are many many merchants right now who only accept cash - mostly small restaurants, small shops etc. They do not want their finances to be visible to the government for all kinds of reasons (mostly to dodge tax). 
If nothing else, Bitcoin will allow these sorts of merchants to give customers the convenience of not having to carry wads of cash everywhere.
You know not everything in the world has to be absolute right? It's possible for a merchant to offer VISA AND Bitcoin and for them to benefit from that.
Everything I said about Bitcoin and fees isn't rendered invalid by the fact some people will want to pay with VISA.

Okay I can help out with this. 
Context: a shop that doesn't just take cash and put it in a box. We're talking about a shop that already accepts other forms of electronic payment.
Actually opening merchant accounts for VISA, MasterCard, American Express, blah blah, is a pain in the ass for anyone (unless they are super good with "the computer" which is only true in certain types of shops.)
Then you have to buy or lease Point-of-Sale machines. This may be as simple as a cash register, or you might have to have a scanny beepy thing, or some kind of chip-and-pin NFC reader etc. This are almost always branded by specific banks and guess who gets a tiny (or maybe not even so tiny) cut...
Then, you open up and somebody comes in with a Diners Club card and you say you don't accept it so they get shitty. Then you take a bunch of VISA transactions and you realise the merchant fees are starting to add up so you try to be honest with your customer and you say "I have to charge a surcharge" and they get shitty.
Worst of all, you have to wait days, weeks, maybe longer to actually get your money from VISA. It all depends on which bank you go with, some are faster, but it sucks AND dickhead customers can do chargebacks in some situations.
On the other hand Bitcoin requires you to have a computer and an internet connection.
The customer comes up, you say "that will be 42,000 sats please" (this is in the future) and they scan a QR code you flash up, tap "confirm" on their phone, and because this is the future the tx is registered on the blockchain almost instantaneously.
Now, as the merchant, you know the customer will pay a network fee for this tx. This has no effect on the amount you receive, but it could make the customer annoyed. But - and this is crucial - unlike a credit card tx, *the customer has already paid the fee*. This means your choice, as the merchant, is to either do nothing, *or to refund them the fee somehow.*
The difference between a shop saying "VISA? I'll need another dime please." and "Bitcoin network busy? Oh, have a free brownie because of the tx fee" is ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE. Humans are emotional creatures. A shopkeep saying "aw man, fees suck, have a cookie" will do so much to reduce everyday stress down at the mall. You think this isn't important? It's really important.
And this is all before we even get into how the merchant saves on bank deposit fees and every other dime and nickel extracted from them by the finance industry. 
I guarantee you, for the first little while after BTC is everywhere, in every shop, you will be spending less on your goods because the merchant is paying nothing but tax. Nothing but tax.
They can try to dodge the tax of course, but  that's nothing new.

Caveat emptor? More like Carpe diem!
Which as students of Horace (and me because I got stuck at a party with a girl who is a student of bloody Horace) will know, doesn't actually mean "make the most of your life because life is a special gift and you must live up to your potential blah blah" which is a misreading started by Byron and, rather more prosaically, hammered into the modern consciousness by fucking *Dead Poet's Society*.
Carpe diem *actually* means "shit man, stop taking everything so seriously and live for the moment, because you've only got one life and you can't control the unknowns waiting in your future, so literally crush some grapes and drink some wine with me, hot girlfriend who is the person I am speaking to in this poem."
In other words:
"Dad, a guy came to school and said if I did a summer course I could apply for an internship at Big Firm and this  could maybe lead to a position, but I was going to go on that surfing trip with the boys..."
"Well son, you know what they say. Carpe diem."
"Son, I know we were going to wash the cars today, but have you seen the surf report? Amazing waves! Plus you're going off to college in three weeks, so carpe diem!"
I... I don't really know why I wrote this. It seemed important. I think people could do with a relaxing a bit, is all. Maybe? After all, *forsan miseros meliora sequentur.*

Yeah I am the same. I am sure there is some kind of "system" or normal way of doing it. I have seen those smaller gold bullion, from 5g up, and they usually have a mint's "mark" on them so when you give them to a dealer, the dealer will just take them without having to "assay" them first.
I just googled then - apparently you can get gold *coins* which look fancier and are legal tender so usually not subject to the same taxes as bullion can be. The Perth Mint (Australia) says coins are sometimes better because smaller gold dealers will almost always take them because they are shinier and have milled edges! How funny is that...

I think fees will be lower, due to volume on the network. This is assuming we upgrade the tech to enable super-fast transactions.
Remember, most txs will still be the equivalent of a few bucks here and there, if BTC is to be an "everyday" currency. 
But if miners try to charge $100 to tx for a cup of coffee, well people won't pay THAT. 
So I think the fees will stay the same or fall a bit in "purchasing power parity" terms, but in BTC terms they will be more like in the low hundreds of sats.

There are "magic words" used about Bitcoin by most enthusiasts as if merely saying "Bitcoin is deflationary" is an important part of its superiority over fiat.
I think it's useful to remind at least some here, that "a pipeline has two ends" and any economic thing that happens is going to be bad for some people and good for others.
There's a dominant narrative around that "inflation is out of control" because "the central banks keep printing money" and "the dollar has lost so much of its value" as if the value of any given dollar matters in and of itself. 
The value of the dollar only matters in the context of the entire economic system. What matters is stability, with sustainable growth so people can increase their standard of living. That should be the focus: sustainable growth in standard of living for everyone.
I think it's worth reminding people that "deflation" is, in most circumstances, way way worse than inflation. Only hyperinflation is worse. Oh and there's stagflation too, that's pretty nasty.
I think it's great that you already know this, but I can tell you from reading around this place, plenty of people either don't, or (more likely) don't even think about it.

If you sell your BTC, then yes a dip loses your capital.
If your plan was always to hold for 10 years, and you have 10BTC now, then in 10 years you will still have 10BTC, and you do not lose any "capital".
The exchange rate of GBP for BTC affects all BTC users equally (well, more or less - different exchanges convert at different rates of course). 
Consider a situation, unlikely as it is, where the value of BTC falls against the USD, but climbs slightly against the GBP.

Bitcoin confuses them. They can't decide what it is. They say all this shit about bingo-bongo curves and fallalaley continuums, but they don't get it.
I think a big part of it is that with other crashes, they put the rout down to investors panicking and running. They never acknowledge the fundamental truth: the stock crashed because it was shares in bullshit.
Tulip bulbs crashed when everyone realised no one wanted to buy the tulips. The South Sea company crashed because... well the full answer takes a book, but at least part of it was the shares were so expensive, people could only "buy" them if the company lent them money to buy the shares, which doesn't make any sense at all to me but then it was 1720. Point is, the company couldn't pay its bills so it collapsed.
Housing crisis: homes we sold to people who couldn't pay for them. Lehman Brothers: lied about how much money they had, basically.
The point being that all these crashes happened because, in essence, what was being sold was bullshit.
Bitcoin is real, it works. Where's the bullshit? If someone puts up $5000 for 1.0BTC, we aren't going to say "oh shit dude, we actually don't have any Bitcoins!" People aren't buying because BTC says it's about to get a massive construction contract, or open up a new oil field, or anything. It already is what it is!
And most importantly of all, the price doesn't even matter. People can still use it even if the price falls. Maybe not if it falls to zero, but that just ain't gonna happen. 
This idea that "no one takes Bitcoin" is increasingly not true, and it was a dumb argument to make. It's like, we say "hey we've invented a new currency!" And then everyone said, before we even made the first coin, "this is crap, nobody takes your new currency!" Hey, how about giving us a goddamn DECADE at least, huh?
In short. Relax and hodl and if it goes down to $2000, buy more. Try to get that psychologically important "1.0BTC".
Because if you end up with 1.0BTC or more, you will be among a tiny, tiny portion of the global population that will ever own a full Bitcoin.
Which is pretty goddamn cool.

Refreshing honesty. I am sure there are plenty of dudes who are like "HAHAHAHAHA SUFFER IN YER JOCKS!" because they sold out at $250, $750, $1000, $1300, $2000 etc...
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:07:34
Theory: when it was $1000 the first time, nobody could quite believe what was happening. So as soon as it started to slip, they bailed. 
When it was a few hundred, and started to slip, people said "hey I've already changed $100 into $20,000, better no get greedy!" and bailed.
Now we have lots of people who have bought because they believe it will go up and up and up. They may be wrong, but their belief matters.
Weak hands will bail, of course, but people who would have been all "lol I made $7000!" back in the day are now "No way am I taking a $1200 loss three days after I finally convinced my wife to let me buy in..."

Sigh. If you believe Bitcoin is the future of money, then your "capital" is how much Bitcoin you hold, right? 
If you bought Bitcoin at $4000 and its destiny is to be worth $100,000 one day, then the rises and dips in fiat value between today and that wonderful, magical day don't matter.
UNLESS you want to increase the amount of Bitcoin you hold.

If you sell your BTC, then yes a dip loses your capital.
If your plan was always to hold for 10 years, and you have 10BTC now, then in 10 years you will still have 10BTC, and you do not lose any "capital".
The exchange rate of GBP for BTC affects all BTC users equally (well, more or less - different exchanges convert at different rates of course). 
Consider a situation, unlikely as it is, where the value of BTC falls against the USD, but climbs slightly against the GBP.

Serious dude, get over the "intrinsic value" thing. Gold has no intrinsic value as money, in fact its practical value as a conductor, insulator etc etc is disadvantaged by the way humans irrationally perceive it as super-valuable. Gold should be like any other high-atomic-weight metal - used for the specific things it can be used for, and priced based on the work it takes to turn it into insulation or wire. It shouldn't cost $1,000,000 to wrap your spaceship in insulating foil.
Look at diamonds. Diamonds have such low *intrinsic* value that when civilization figured out how to make diamond, De Beers had to say "uh no well, see now look, it's the FLAWS and impurities in the natural diamonds that make them valuable while industrial diamonds which are much harder and don't shatter as easily, are rubbish."
We literally let them convince us that crappier, dirtier diamonds are superior to pure-carbon diamonds. How nuts is that?
It's all about a social contract, a universal agreement that "substance X" is valuable for some reason.
What has value is the work you do, and the work other people do, and how that work improves the tangible and intangible things around us.
This is a particular view of economics, but to me at least it makes a heck of a lot more sense than "this soft shiny yellow rock is super valuable because it's rare AND you can make necklaces out of it."

Holy shit dude, what magical exchange are you using where they let you convert fiat to BTC for no fee?

Meanwhile, you need to get over being offended by terms. "To the moon" IS discussion, it's discussion about how likely it is that BTC will be worth a massive amount one day.
Many people "invest" in US dollars, there's nothing wrong with that and in fact the system needs us to give out fiat over to BTC so that it's value can climb to something that's useful in an everyday context.
We are in the "battle" phase and volatility is fine. Within a few years, things will smooth out... or BTC will die altogether.

As with 79.82% of the arguments in this place, the whole thing is too didactic. There's an emergent faction that seems to think BTC is being rekt because it is being (1) hodled instead of (2) spent on coffee. Those are the only two scenarios offered.
Of course by coffee we mean a "casual transaction". Chuck a few quarters on the counter, then mosey on out. Right?
There is QUITE a bit of opportunity between hodl/Lambo and cup of coffee you know. 
I don't spend BTC on very small purchases because it is a bit of a PITA right now, sure. But I do spend it on things worth a couple of hundred bucks, *because the merchant often offers a massive discount if I pay in BTC.* (I then go replace my BTC immediately with a fiat purchase on exchange.)
When I get 20% off, stacked on top of a 9% loyalty discount, on a $250 purchase, do I give a shit about a $4.27 tx fee? I do not! I don't even give a shit about the exchange fees for replacing the BTC! And when I am buying something online to be delivered to me, I also do not give a shit if the confirmation takes 5, 10, 40 or 90 minutes.
People are referencing the white paper "ew Satoshi said it has to be digital CASH ew" but did they read the whole thing? Or just the Abstract?
What is literally the first sentence of the Introduction? 


*Commerce on the internet*.
Does this mean "online shopping" or "any transaction that utilises the network, even buying a $2 coffee with a VISA"? Well, that's the economics debate right there.
Later in the paragraph, in his criticism of the existing monetary system, he says "the cost of mediation [cuts] off the possibility of small casual transactions." This might seem to imply that he also wanted BTC to work as nickels and dimes but... does it?
Did the original vision consider Bitcoin as "walking around money"? Or does it define Bitcoin not as a solution for ALL money, but specifically for when you want to buy stuff on the internet?
At the very least, if you are all about Satoshi's vision, it's pretty clear from the intro he is not picturing you in a coffee shop, he's picturing you on amazon.com.

Also, part of what's awesome about BTC for small merchants (er... right now who are selling expensive things, thanks tx fees!) is that they DON'T NEED to buy or rent expensive POS systems. 
Just whip out your mobile, and show the customer the QR code, they hold up their phone, bingle bongle. No NFC bullshit, no Bluetooth, no "handshake failed" or whatever. 
The only reason i don't use QR codes at my desk is that it creeps me out how FAST and ACCURATE it is.

But I am on your side. Because the poster above me said his dad *works for Lockheed Martin* yet like so many semi-fossilised "mrrrrm,  billion dollar disposable multi-stage rockets were good enough for me, they should be good enough for you" engineers, he runs this weird line about the reusable engines being an "old idea".
It's so bullshit because, as I tried to convey with sarcasm, these old slide-rule operators forget that computers make so much more possible.
Consider consumer drones. Quadcopters were invented decades ago but you needed to be a fucking savant to fly one unassisted. The aircraft manoeuvres by changing the speed of each rotor, not tilting the airfoils like on a helicopter.
You NEED a computer - and specifically a gyroscope/accelerometer SOC - to even make the DJI Phantom 4 usable. 
The same with SpaceX. Back in the 20C, NASA considered and decided not to pursue reusable first stages because they weren't just lifting a few thousand pounds to the ISS. They were sending humans to the goddam moon which requires, I forget, something like 1000 TIMES more energy than going to LEO? Oh also they were doing it in the 1970s and had hardly any computers. It was a wonder those things didn't just explode on the pad. [Looks at the USSR]. Oh.
Dude - I do not think SpaceX is a gimmick, and part of what makes SpaceX work is of course that it DOES have a customer (NASA) and a regular delivery run to orbit (the ISS) to make a reusable rocket profitable.

No you can TECHNICALLY pull your money out at any time.
In reality, the speed of your exit will be determined by how fast whoever you dump your BTC on can get you your fiat cash. 
Okay sure, you can use your exchange account to turn BTC into cash *immediately* but right now every time there's a BIG spasm of profit-taking, many exchanges go "Oh we are having some delays on withdrawals... please come back in a day or so... lala..."
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:58:49
Ah! Well if you're asking in good faith, then no problem, thanks for engaging. I got on a bit of a roll here, but I had fun thinking about, so interested to hear more challenges. Let's take a look...
Okay so we're setting the scope here at a company, that sells to retail (ie interacts without written contracts, just face-to-face over-the-counter transactions), with a number of sites such that a single IT-support person can't be everywhere at once, and there's a bigger-than-tiny workforce (you'd probably have more than 20 cashiers for 10 sites, but whatever...).
 You'll have to train staff constantly anyway, that's the nature of electronic payments. VISA introduces new features every couple of years, there are new scanners and whatnot. Yes, it's an extra thing, but training people (who are constantly asking, but how does it WORK how does it WORK) in Bitcoin is pretty fast. It's a matter of bringing up an app on a tablet, then asking the customer to scan the QR code. Other, even easier systems will come in time, ESPECIALLY use of NFC scanners.
**Accountability system.**
 Bitcoin is functionally like cash, in the context of a shop. You will still need a "till" that functions as a private ledger that you check against your actually takings - this is a core part of running a shop properly. Your "cash register" doesn't just hold money, it keeps a record of all transactions. 
The main risk with BTC I'd say is an employee either tricking a customer into sending the BTC to THEIR wallet instead of the shop's, or transacting BTC out of the shop's wallet into their wallet. 
The latter can be stopped fairly easily with software. The "merchant grade" wallet software will only allow BTC to be sent with a "manager password" or similar. With BTC, every sale is exact change - you should never need to transact from the shop's wallet to a customer. UNLESS you are processing a refund - and those already often need manager approval.
Your manager will be able to steal from you. That's the way it's always been.
BUT  the advantage over cash is the public ledger - you can see WHEN and exactly HOW MUCH BTC was sent from the shop's till (wallet) and match that up with security footage of who was at the till at the time (which you probably already have if you handle cash).
If an employee intercepts the payment, your private ledger (your till or your float) won't match how much BTC was actually txed to the wallet.
If your employee is sly enough to take a customer's BTC, give them product, and not have it register on the till at all, then you'll find out when you stocktake. Or the thefts will be so small they don't impact your revenue, and you never find out. This happens with cash today all the time. Some accounts software will even let you allow for x% employee theft. (There's also shoplifting, which has nothing to do with BTC necessarily, but it happens so much big supermarkets allow for it and call it "shrinkage".)
Anyway, employees have pilfered from owners since shopping was invented. Bottom line: in the medium term, until BTC Banks appear, all BTC should be treated as cash, as negotiable "hard" currency that anyone can just pick up off the counter if it's left lying around. 
**Security of the shop's wallet on the internet at large.**
Someone is going to make a LOT of money providing "secure wallet" or "merchant grade crypto wallets" for shops. These will still be software like our wallets, but on top of that will probably include a hardware element that makes the security on a Trezor look like nothing.
These wallets will be backed by companies that provide guarantees they won't be hacked or cracked, and if they are the merchant will receive compensation.
Yes, they will cost money but the point is the merchant has a CHOICE. They can, if they want, use their own software wallet or hardware wallet or whatever they want.
But what's super cool about BTC is that the wallet you send customer payments too can be *completely separate from the till*. Software will check the balances, make sure everything matches up, but you can have the shop set up to send BTC to an address not associated with any piece of hardware or software on the premises. There will be no way for a hacker to come to the shop, scope the place out, and figure out which wallet they have to crack.
I suspect merchants will be offered "offsite secure wallet services" and ultimately these will of course evolve into banks.
**Constantly checking the price of Bitcoin.**
You are right that at least for, hell I'm going to say until the end of the decade or even 2025, everything will still be priced relative to fiat. You will have a product worth $10, and you will set the BTC price accordingly. 
You'll have software to handle the checking and changing automatically though. And this gives some interesting opportunities for the canny merchant...
If you know BTC is starting a bull run, you can drop all the BTC prices in your shop and advertise it as a sale. Then take some fiat profit or do whatever you want! Or if BTC price is dropping, subtly raise prices such that peeps don't even realise. Shady!
Anyway the point is if you buy a product from a supplier who only accepts fiat and you pay, say $60 wholesale, and so you need to sell the product at $99 to make profit, your software can automatically adjust the BTC value of that product day by day or even hour by hour.
Until we are paying in mBTC or sats, no one is going to clue to the difference between 0.02629 and 0.02646. For at least several weeks. Ahem.
Eventually of course, Bitcoin will have been "charged up" by trillions of dollars of investment and use, and when billions of people are using it (yes yes, IF they are using it IF IF), the price fluctuations should be no more severe than the way the US dollar moves against the Euro. Paying in BTC will be like you are an international traveller paying for stuff in a foreign currency... it's just that I think ultimately the "foreign" currency will be fiat.
Holy shit I ran out of comment space... TBC!

Personally I think a lot of the "troubles" we've had in the last two decades stem from the dark mirror version of Meade's quote: 
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtless, self-interested cowards can't destroy a world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."
A lot of what was done to put the financial system in such a messed up state ready for the GFC, was things that used to get people arrested 30 years ago. The actions of Nick Leeson that led to the destruction of Baring's Bank were unthinkable in 1995... and today everyone does what he did, all the time (just a bit more subtly).
Part of it is the rise of toxic sovereign individuality. I look after number one and no one better get in my way. Kill or be killed etc. 
In another thread, they were joking about buying Lamborghini's with their Bitcoins and I said anyone who uses Bitcoin to buy a Lambo is a traitor to the cause.
I was downvoted of course - but not for disrespecting Lambo. I was downvoted for even hinting that they shouldn't necessarily just buy whatever the hell they want, AND they were (and I use the term advisedly) "triggered" by the expression "traitor to the cause".
Because even suggesting, even implying that they owed a duty or obligation to something bigger than themselves, made them recoil on a visceral level. 
There is something wrong in a big part of, I think mainly American, society. I think parents are maybe not treating kids like individuals, while at the same time the media is constantly barraging them with the commandment: BE AN INDIVIDUAL!
Every ad, every reality TV show says they are special and they deserve more, and that everyone should look at THEM and THEY are the most important person in the world with a special gift and...
...and apparently studies show that for most teenagers, the people they really want to hang out with and have deep conversations with are their parents. It's seems counter-intuitive but there it is. And parents are not giving kids this attention.
Or perhaps I'm overthinking it...

No, it's very distinct from both a lottery (total randomness, no guaranteed winner) and gambling (players paying in hopes of winning a prize). YOU may think it's too complex to analyse and thus it FEELS like chance, to you, but it isn't.
Just a note on casino gambling though - the important point is that casinos don't just "take a cut". If you played in a casino for infinite time, you have a 100% certainty of losing all your money because the games are constructed to favour the house over time.
The longer you play, the more you lose. The only way to "win" is to stop playing.
That's not true of Bitcoin.

MSM struggles with this question: How is Bitcoin scary? How is a middle-class white person sitting in a plush loungeroom in the suburbs, going to be convinced that Bitcoin is so terrifying that you have to stay glued to FOX for hours to make sure you don't miss any updates?
The only possible FOX-level outcomes for Bitcoin are:
1. Bitcoin goes to the Moon. This is a happy story about investors making lots of money. People who don't have Bitcoin will switch off in disgust.
2. Bitcoin crashes to zero. People will enjoy this for a little while imagining all those "smartass geeks" losing their shirts, but then FOX will have to admit that most people only invested a couple of grand and almost nobody lost their house or anything. And that's boring so they'll switch off.
No fear. No show.

Kudos for using the word “expect”. Because right now this sub goes:

[Price slide deepens.]
HODLERS: Woo! Enjoy the discount! Hodl4lyfe!
FUDLERS: You people are idiots. I’m out at $4200.
[Price collapses to $3200]
NOOBLERS: Why did I buy at $4300? Why Whyyyyyy?
HODLERS: It will bounce, you watch. Testing $4500 then to the moon!
FUDLERS: Shorts locked in. 
[Price bottoms at a bit under $3000 depending where you look.]
NOOBLERS: I’m ruined.
HODLERS: [gritted teeth] Still hodling, I will buy now [checks real-world wallet, moths fly out]
FUDLER: haha! Proven! Vindicated! $1800 by Oct 1, never say I was wrong again!
[Price hurtles back up to $3600, then $3800, then tests $4000]
NOOBLERS: WTF? But I bought at $4200 come on...
HODLERS: Ha! Antifragile! Bitcoin is king!
FUDLERS: Meow meow meow.
[Price bumpity bumps along at $3700-$3900]
NOOBLER: OMG I’ve lost so much money.
HODLER: Get ready for moon launch. $5000 within days.
FUDLERS: [silent]
[Price starts dipping back toward $3500]
NOOBLER: Noooooo! Bitcoin is deeeeeaaaad!
HODLER: [silent]
FUDLERS: Never say I was wrong again. Will test $2200 then long period of nothing. Maybe $1800 by Christmas. All is turned to ashes and ruin...

FUDLERS: Priced in. Don’t even.
Next? Price will explode this afternoon? Price will hold at $3500 until Oct? Price will collapse down to whichever low number makes the fudlers feel the most thrill?

Meanwhile, you need to get over being offended by terms. "To the moon" IS discussion, it's discussion about how likely it is that BTC will be worth a massive amount one day.
Many people "invest" in US dollars, there's nothing wrong with that and in fact the system needs us to give out fiat over to BTC so that it's value can climb to something that's useful in an everyday context.
We are in the "battle" phase and volatility is fine. Within a few years, things will smooth out... or BTC will die altogether.

They understand: volatile risk, people making millions from a $100 buy in 2010, ICOs are like the dotcom bubble and lots of altcoins will go to zero, something something drug lords anonymity, something something ponzi scheme.
Not a one of them can explain why Bitcoin was created (beyond "anonymity") or why anyone would want it.

Okay. Enough people have objected to this so:
Modern Lamborghini is of course owned by VAG and takes a bunch of its tech from Audi. The Audi R8 was essentially invented as an "Audi Lambo" - at least the V10 one anyway.
Here's a quote from some random guy on some random Lambo forum:


So he doesn't see a problem with it. But it is true that (depending on what model you get) there are "bits" in a Lambo that are from extremely not-super cars. 
Maybe YOU don't care, but when I drop house money on a car, I don't want Golf GTI mirror switches or Toyota Corolla AC vents. 
Consider a Pagani. It's also an "Anti-Ferrari" in many ways, but it is absolutely bespoke at every level. Every single part of it is unique to the car. Yes, it's also a lot more expensive than an Aventador, so maybe I'm also saying set your sights higher.
Isn't a Lambo an "entry level" supercar in many ways? Why not drool for something that actually going to appreciate, like half the Ferraris and even (dare I say it) the Porsches?
Ugh, Lambo!
Fine. Buy what you want. Just don't complain when you realise your supercar has the same indicator stalk as your kid's teacher's hatchback.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:31:55
You mean all these stories of "I threw away 200BTC in an old computer" etc? 
It's interesting. "Attrition" could be a problem for Bitcoin in the future. But it's the hard 21 million limit that makes it so attractive. Certainly for now, having fewer coins available for purchase will only keep the price high. 
And we want the price of a full Bitcoin to be very high, so it makes the currency more useful for everyday purchases. It divides into 100,000,000ths as you know, so there's plenty of scope for price growth.
If one satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) was worth US$1, then the total "value capacity" of all 21 million Bitcoins would be... uh...
$2,100,000,000,000,000. Which is $2.1 quintillion. 
I think we can afford to lose a couple of million Bitcoins here and there.

Can anyone explain how this kind of thing can be taken seriously at all? 
If you're on the side of a parabola, it trends near-vertical very quickly and once you're trending heavily toward x=y, then chopping it any any point looks like a top.
So this guy said Sep 1 was the "end of the cycle" but the shape is just that it could easily have gone into October, November, at any point there's near-exponential grow, he could have said "the cycle is about to finish".
This time he guessed right.
But I'm sure these people are super smart - why do they think they can "predict" these moves when "past gains are no guarantee of future performance."?
Not trying to be smart - I'm really interested!
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:10:58
But Bitcoin didn't go south. That's the point he's making. He's saying, given that Bitcoin increased massively in value, he "wish[es] I dumped them into BTC back then."
He knows at the time he couldn't have known and that, given the level of his knowledge, backing Bitcoin then would have been a "guess".
History has shown that it would have been a correct guess, though.
Putting all your money into Bitcoin in the PRESENT on the other hand, well you're definitely right it could go south. But it didn't in the past.
This seems to be something people around here struggle with.
"I wish I'd invested $100,000 in Bitcoin in 2010!"
"Are you CRAZY?! That would have been IDIOTIC! You had no idea, it could have CRASHED!"
"I... I know? That's why I didn't do it? But still, if you look at the numbers, if I had done it I could have been pretty much a billionaire by now."
"BUT YOU COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN!"
"Yes... yes I know. That's why... can you hear me? That's why I didn't put $100K into... look, just forget it okay?"

My feeling is that the "crashes" will be from 20K down to 13K, from 45K down to 22K, that kind of thing. 
Unlike all the other bubbles throughout history, there's no risk of everyone going "wait a minute! I've got a million bucks worth of tulip bulbs, and no one is going to be able to afford to buy the tulips! Aaaagh dump dump dump!"
1.0BTC would have to end up being worth more than $100 million for Bitcoin to become unaffordable for normal people. Even 1 sat = $1 is a workable currency.
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:05:46
The points you are making here are good but you must take this into account: we are in the startup phase.
An increasing number of merchants take bitcoin directly. Are they merchants you personally want to use right now? Probably not. But saying Bitcoin is unspendable (as Bitcoin) is like, back in 1915, saying middle class people can't afford to have a telephone in their own home, so telephone technology is pointless since everyone has to go to the telegram office anyway.
To some extent we are like startup investors, providing the seed capital for future returns. It's not quite like that, because it's not like a company takes our money and we have nothing more to do with it. You and I can do business in Bitcoin right now, no problem. I can ask for a picture of your computer, and offer 0.00002BTC if you email it to me. As soon as I get the email, I can send the 0.00002BTC to your account. We might have to wait for the transaction to confirm for a bit, and the fee might be stupid high, but those are issues that can and will be solved.
Because the ability to exchange goods and services for Bitcoin already exists, it will roll out very quickly. You'll see. This will be a Bitcoin Christmas.
As for these people who sell 30,000 to dip the market... this is correct in *theory* but consider that it's such a huge amount of money right now. What exchange or what individual would give this player (checks price) holy shit $140 million dollars for 30,000 BTC all at once at the top of an all time high?
They would have to sell it in bits, and each bit would realise less than the bit before. But the time they are dumping the last 1000BTC, the price will probably be down 10%. Yet, such is the demand right now, will it slump that much?
They could quite realistically end up with only $100 million cash but a Bitcoin price of $4500. Converting that back into Bitcoins would only give them 22,222 (huh, neat) BTC.
Could a big sale like that put Bitcoin into a super-big-slump where the big sale is just the beginning of it? Sure, technically. But right now everyone is so convinced the price will go up, if it drops even just $200 they pounce and start buying again. The age of the super-swings may be over.
As for bursty bubbles, you are right. There probably will be a moment, maybe next year, when it goes crazy crazy and then pops... but it won't pop to zero. It will pop to an amount that is still higher than anything anyone is paying today.

Learn to read.
1. the digital currency has soared
2. spurred by:
3. a. greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins exchange
3. b. optimism that faster transaction times will encourage broader use
There's no argument that a and b aren't true, but there is an argument about how significant they are in BTC's rise in 2017.
Of course it's people buying BTC that drives the price up, ultimately. But why did people start buying BTC now? Why did we hit the critical mass now, not last year? What "spurred" the price rise and created an environment where lots more people wanted to buy BTC?

It really is mob rule. This thread seems to say there have been some BIG sells - 100BTC a minute - and on top of this there is a strong rumour that China will close at least the exchange of non-Bitcoin cryptos for fiat.
Anyone who is trying to make money quickly will have bought in this week a little hesitantly since the price was stabilising and rising again after last weekend's dip.
As soon as their chart shows the big scary-looking downward stab from the big transactions, they will sell. This reinforces the dip. Others see the selling, see the price softening, they panic and sell as well. 
So one group is out there (probably in China, though it's 11:22pm for them right now) selling, but meanwhile people like us are like "yes, a couple of hundred bucks relief, buy buy buy!"
So the price is already bouncing back... and dipping... and rising... and wobbling...
Traditionally, with other stocks, we are supposed to get fatigued by all this volatility and say "stuff it I'm going to buy something else" and crash the "stock" all the way down to peanuts.
Fingers crossed, knock on wood, Bitcoin may already be immune to this since it's so (relatively) easy to buy an amount of Bitcoin you can afford, AND there are millions of people who want in now.
Many of the big exchanges have HUGE backlogs of new member sign ups.
Stay the course. It will be worth it.

Again, semantics and definition. I am not arguing that the risk was high or the "odds" were long (though I'd content thinking about Bitcoin in terms of "odds" is wrong), I'm arguing that you cannot call this man "idiotic" TODAY.
Idiotic is making a decision against your best interest for no goddamn reason at all. Idiotic is when you are told all the risks and possible outcomes, and you make a decision for which there is no guaranteed outcome at all.
There is a guaranteed outcome for Bitcoin - it will go up or it will go down. Betting on it is not "idiotic". It is risky.
The point is that everyone looks at this guys success and wants to dismiss it as "luck". It wasn't "luck". His result did not come about because a bunch of balls fell out of a basket in a certain order. His result came about because everyone got into Bitcoin. He guessed that this would happen and he was right.
HE'S NOT IDIOTIC. If he had not made this decision he would have less money.
You can't dismiss that. You need to adjust your analysis to something a bit more complex than "yeah sure, he got lucky, but he was an idiot to risk so much."
HE WASN'T AN IDIOT because the risk paid off. 
Is it idiotic to say "oh well this DEFINITELY means that Bitcoin will continue to go up so I will borrwo $400K from a loan shark". Yes of course it is. Is it idiotic to say "Hmn... Bitcoin always goes up... I think I will risk a little more because of this information, maybe even to the point where a downturn could hurt me." No, that's not idiotic. That's a calculated risk.
"Don't risk more than you can afford to lose" is trite and SAFE. None of you care whether some random guy goes bankrupt because of a bad Bitcoin call - in fact you'd fucking LOVE crowing over it. But you're all so scared of someone saying "hey you told me this was a sure thing" that you're nonsensically insisting that a person who made $600K without working IS AN IDIOT.
I'm not telling you take crazy risks. I'm not telling you Bitcoin is a sure thing. I'm just telling you that if someone takes a risk and it pays off, it's not necessarily because they were dumb. Shockingly - and unthinkably especially to Americans - it could be because they were *really smart*.

In this case, not selling at $5000 has the benefit of not losing BTC. After the dip and recovery, you still have the same number of BTC.
Selling at $4500 and buying back in at much lower than $4500, while it carries a risk of BTC not dipping further, nevertheless gives the benefit of ending up with more BTC than you started.
The opportunity cost was the difference in BTC.
I guess the lottery does have an opportunity cost too. You can take the benefit of keeping your $6, in exchange for the "cost" of not winning the lottery. Unfortunately the risk - that you don't choose the right numbers - is almost a mathematical certainty.

Real talk: you believed in it enough to buy at $4950. So now it is cheaper, you can buy more if you want, and once it gets back to $4950 you will have more BTC than you would have if it had never dipped.
Think of the math. Imagine you had $10,000 to spend (Heh). At $4950 you bought $5000 worth and got 1.01BTC. Then the price dipped to $3200 and you spent your second $5000 and got 1.5BTC for a total of 2.51BTC.
Alternate timeline there was no dip, in fact the price climbed to $5500! So you got your 1.01BTC the same, but when you spent your second $5000, you only got 0.9BTC. Total: 1.91BTC.
Now the timestreams converge and the price goes  up to $10,000. Both timelines saw you spend $10K, but only the timeline with the dip sees you now holding $25,100 worth of Bitcoin.
Could Bitcoin never never never be worth $10K, or never never never go up again? It's possible. But given the state of the world at large, it seems very unlikely.
At this point in time, the price for fiat doesn't matter. Only the survival of the network, the widening of its adoption, and how many BTC you hold matters

Sweet blistering Christ are you for real? There is a growing divide in this community between "we believe in the technology!" and "I am trying to build wealth in a world that is hostile to me, a poor person, doing that." Cypher-wannabes are tying to convince us that - despite their MASSIVE positions worth tens of thousands to millions - they are really in it for the money and anyone else who ALSO wants to get rich is evil or impure or something.
Worse than this though, by saying "you should have got in earlier" you are EXACTLY LIKE the current 1%-ers. While SOME fiat-billionaires are rich due to hard work and innovation, most of them are billionaires because they "got in early." They had parents who were rich, and grandparents who were rich. Etc.
Also, are we not, as a community, only *tolerant* of day-traders rather than champions of them? A temporary drop in the value of BTC only "hurts" those attempting to extract a quick profit from *our* early faith and commitment to this experiment.
Are you seriously taking the position "I got mine so go fuck yourself" in the context of *Bitcoin*?! Are you yourself such an asshole that you won't tolerate a few months of lower values - which incidentally would also let YOU increase your position - so that more folks who believe in Bitcoin can come in on it?
If BTC shoots up to $10,000 in six hours, that value simply cannot be sustained. If it grows to that value over a sensible time period backed by real underlying commerce, it can.
If it drops to, say, $3400 for the rest of this week, that will encourage exactly the kinds of people others are complaining don't exist - those who buy in, get maybe 5% or 10% growth in a week or a month, and then spend their coins on a new PC or some DVDs or posters or something. We want people spending BTC like everyday money. *But we need to offer them some incentive to do that.* A modest bump in value that turns their $500 in $580 over a fortnight will do that.
Of course, if the price goes down in that period, they will wail and cry and either exit - giving others an opportunity to buy in - or they will toughen up and wait and learn something about the value of patience, and by the end of the month they will be installing their shiny new 1080ti that "cost" them $300.
Oh, btw it's flattering that you think my "rooting" for cheap coins could actually have any effect on the price whatsoever, but have you ever considered the concept of "making the best of a bad situation"? I am reasonably seriously invested in BTC and if the experiment fails I will take a measurable hit to my overall net worth. So I'm no benchwarmer.
When drops occur now, it's not US who's dropping the price. It's the big boys trying to get in on the cheap. So why not ride that train? Don't be the little fishing boat tumbling in the container ship's wake. Be the dolphin surfing the bow-wave.

At this level we are into a semantic argument which is difficult to resolve in any meaningful way. You're getting into very granular definition of "idiot."
If you define "idiot" as "making a choice where there is a definite outcome either way but you can't know which way it will break" then, well, pretty much every decision anyone makes about anything is "idiotic".
Betting that the Patriots will win by 2000 points is "idiotic" because it's outside the reasonable scope of possible outcomes. Merely betting that the Patriots will WIN isn't idiotic, because it's only one of two outcomes, and one or other of the outcomes HAS to happen.
However, the other thing with betting on the Superbowl vs investing in Bitcoin, is that you also know that one team MUST lose (I'm discounting draws here... can the Superbowl draw? I dunno). 
With Bitcoin, there is currently NO EVIDENCE THAT THE PRICE WILL EVER GO DOWN PERMANENTLY. Everyone just assumes it can because "investments" sometimes do that. But is Bitcoin like anything else? No, I think it is reasonable to assert at this point that it does not "crash" like other systems. Not in the same way, to the same level.
If the price drops catastrophically, and the game is up, well that's an unpredictable outcome based on existing data. It's an "act of God" if you will.
Refusing to take any risk because you are worried about an "act of God" event is, by definition "idiotic". Limiting your risk against a possible Act of God event isn't idiotic, but it will limit the possible size of the reward you can realise.
Why do I care about this issue? Because Bitcoin relies on everyone backing it. And if we dismiss the early winners as "idiots" for super-backing it, then that's not good for the future of the system.
We dismiss and trivialise those who do the most to ensure the value climbs. Buying lots of Bitcoin does more to make YOUR stake more valuable, than buying 0.00002 or whatever.

If there's a worse example of trying to equate an external event with "ultimate unpredictability", I can't think of one. Everyone has been saying everywhere that China will do some kind of regulatory thing that will affect Bitcoin's price, and even people who aren't being that specific have been saying the ICO craze will result in a big correction at some point. 
Any person who bought Bitcoin without considering how this could affect their investment in the short to medium term can't say "Oh man, China banned ICOs, what a rotten bit of luck!"
I get it: You're trying to explain that Bitcoin's price is so unpredictable that committing a large investment to Bitcoin is functionally the same as gambling in a casino. It isn't because there is no meta-game happening here, where some other player (the house, a government, a shadow cabal of cypherpunks, whatever) ultimately wins over the long term no matter what you do.
I do agree that you or I sitting at home at a single PC have little hope of being able to predict Bitcoin's crests and dips. But what I am predicting, right here right now, is that one day soon we will have (well, rich people will have) AIs that analyse millions upon millions of data points - from political opinion polls to recent harvests to consumer confidence to text-analysis of the President's speeches, to how long the average commute was that morning, to the amount of opiate in sewage water (indicating usage levels in general public) to 'comfort rating' of current weather in key markets, all this stuff will go into the pot and the AI will make thousands of tiny purchases and sales, such that the longer the AI operates in the market, the more its purchasing behaviour matches the actual cost of Bitcoin (or whatever it is buying.)
There is no point assigning an AI to the lottery because there really is no way to make a meaningfully useful prediction of which ball is going to fall out of the barrel first. 
Also, maybe go and look up what a "straw man" is huh? Refresh your memory. Because just yelling "OMG you disagree with me? Straw man!" makes you look stupid. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:57:58


Your simplistic statement that started it all. I defined Bitcoin in terms of the kinds of gambling it WASN'T. That is to say, lottery and casino. 
You wanted to redefine your use of gambling to just mean "unpredictable" but you couldn't resist mentioning that exchanges and brokers take a cut:


So you say there IS a "house" that's taking a cut. And I responded to that by pointing out that yeah but it's still not like a casino because no long-odds that favour the house etc.
Just because I aim pointing out how Bitcoin is not like a casino, does not mean that you think it is a casino. 
This is not "straw man".

You're not addressing the argument - whether or not his decision to take out a loan against home equity was "idiotic".
There is no question it was risky. 
Of course the argument hinges on the definition of idiotic. If you define "idiotic" as a category of risk, ie all actions taken at very high risk levels are the definition of idiotic, well, okay.
This is not a universal definition of idiotic though. Use of the word "idiotic" implies an action that was thoughtless, random, irrational, not made based on any reasoning etc. By this (more universal) definition, any idiotic act resists analysis because looking at it can't tell you anything useful.
But we need to reconcile the fact that he took a really big risk AND he made $600K. Just saying "he was lucky" or "he was an idiot" is fine I guess, but how does it help YOU make more money in the future?
If someone wins the lottery there is no point analysing their "system" because winning the lottery is almost perfectly random. But there was a reason this guy decided to go "all in" on Bitcoin at that moment. 
The standard wisdom is "past performance is not an indicator of future gains"... but what if that's not actually true of Bitcoin? What if detailed analysis of every person who bought big at certain times reveals useful information that can help us know when to buy in and when to take profit? I'm not saying there IS, I'm just saying that dismissing every "big winner" as a lucky idiot is shortsighted.
More generally I think we need to develop a more sophisticated and nuanced way of thinking about and talking about people who take really big risks and win. It's not enough to say "pffft, idiot". You need to look at their actions and ask yourself why didn't you do the same. For instance, this guy's experience - sure you wouldn't put your HOUSE on Bitcoin, but does the increasing number of "big winners" make you more confident in increasing your level of risk, given that the reward is so high?
Maybe, maybe not. That's up to you. But it should be a decision based on more than just say "that guy was an idiot."

I'm investing in Bitcoin as a way to make money BECAUSE I believe it is the future of currency. 
Best possible outcome for all of us is a world when 1 satoshi = purchasing power of US$1. 
Critics of Bitcoin who say it is an "accumulative currency" that encourages people to "just hold it without doing any work" don't consider the full picture.
I did my work, I got my fiat, but instead of spending the fiat on things I need, I have "loaned" my fiat to the Bitcoin network to help the network get going.
The people who believed in Bitcoin back back in the day have been appropriately rewarded with life-changing fortunes, because they helped start a brand new system.
The people who bought in after 2013 are being strongly rewarded because they risked money to help shore up the new system.
The people buying in today at $4000+ (to hold, not trade) are giving up significant amounts of purchasing power right now in hopes of a very strong reward a decade down the track. 
Sure, we're not picking a bale or driving in a railway spike. But we are effectively working for "free" at our jobs, to the value of the work we are "loaning" to Bitcoin right now to keep the network growing.
This idea that Bitcoin investors somehow get their coins for free probably comes from old fogeys being confused about how mining works or something. I don't even know.
These critics are the same people who say things like "you shouldn't expect a welfare handout, you should use your god-given brains to think yourself rich!"
Yet when geeks buy Bitcoin at $3, and are now millionaires, those critics are like "this is bullshit, those geeks didn't even work for that money!"
Uh... yeah they did. They put considerable intellectual effort into discovering that Bitcoin existed, understanding how it worked, setting up their wallets, maybe doing a bit of mining in the early days, all that.
It's not THEIR fault that all you rich pricks now want in on the action at $4000 a piece.

It's a heuristics-breaking metaphor problem. We understand new things via metaphor, until eventually the metaphor becomes the meaning.
Why do we *drive* a car? Why is the thing in front of us a *dash board*? Why is ending a phone call called *hanging up*? (These are supposed to be rhetorical but someone will think I'm really asking so: *The answer: each of these things was a new thing with no previous equivalent, so we made best-fit metaphors - we "drive" a car because we "drive" a team of horses. The "dash board" was an actual board on the front of a carriage the driver put his feet on, and "hanging up" is a different case, where it's a straight description of how the first phones physically worked - we hung the earpiece back on the side of the device, which pulled a lever which ended the connection.*)
Talking about Bitcoin means learning a bunch of new metaphors. But there's a disconnect between the metaphor (wallet) and how a wallet on Bitcoin works. If you say "wallet" people think "the coins come off the blockchain and go into my wallet." And of course that's not right.
Incidentally I looked up the etymology of "cash". Cash comes from words that mean "box" or "container". Cash is a container for value.

No, I'm saying the payment systems will be the same, they'll just be based on crypto accounts, not fiat. Or AND fiat. You'll have a fiat VISA and a crypto VISA.
You'll voluntarily sacrifice some aspects of BTC for those petty transactions like coffee etc, in exchange for speed and convenience. But when you want to buy something worth many hundreds of dollars or more, where speed and tx fees don't matter, you can choose to deal direct in BTC, or to keep using your bank and all the legal protections it provides.
Hell, what's the intellectual puzzle here? It's like cash, right? Think about how you use cash today. Cash is anonymous and irreversible, but it's inconvenient and if you "hodl" cash for too long it ends up being worth a lot less - so THAT'S BTC's real job for ordinary people.

Frankly: fuck that. The whole point of BTC is that it evolves naturally and organically. If someone "heavily respected from traditional finance" declares Bitcoin to be worth even betweeen a RANGE of values, then BTC becomes fiat. 
That's what fiat means. The value was declared at one specific moment, by a controlling central authority. Even if the fiat currency then gets floated or changes value, the point is, there's always that "day one arbitrary price" set by the... well hell, originally it was by the King.
What traditional finance can do is go fuck itself, or buy Bitcoin at market rates, and then the price will change accordingly.
Yes, we will need regulation to stop people ripping each other off at the exchange level, at the contract level, all that.

There's your problem right there. WTF does "the virtual coin fundraising of bitcoin" mean? 
These poor guys writing articles with "live update" prices in them.... "Bitcoin, up 2.22%, is plunging!"
Seriously though, say to your Dad this:
- Everyone knows Bitcoin is hard to day-trade or make short term profit off, so you are holding for the long term.
- The Chinese "crackdown" was neither sudden nor unexpected. Did we know they'd ban ICOs? Not specifically, but we have been expecting them to do SOMETHING for months.
- Subscribe to the bitcoin.com daily email newsletter. ALL the stories on that are "Russia drafting legislation to legalise crypto" and "Swiss municipality to allow residents to pay taxes in Bitcoin" etc.
- ALL the negative "crackdown" stuff is about altcoins and shitcoins, not Bitcoin. If he needs a metaphor, say it's like when China finally shut down that famous "genuine fakes" market in Shanghai. When the dotcom bubble popped, it wasn't Amazon or Google that went bust, it was a million bullshit companies that didn't make anything, didn't do anything, just said "lol we are internetting!" that evaporated, and that strengthened the internet 'industry' and from there we never looked back.
- Bitcoin always crashes... to a point higher than the ATH before the previous crash.
- Make a bet with your Dad. Say "Dad give me $5000 and I will buy a Bitcoin (and a bit). In 5 years I will give you either your $5000 back out of my own pocket, or 50% of the capital growth on our Bitcoin."

That feel when you saw it dipping down from $5000 but you thought, nah it will hold, and then you watched it dip down to $4500 and you though nah it will hold, and you saw it dip down to $3000 and you started to get worried but then it bumped back up again and all was cool because you bought in at $1200...
....but on the other hand if you'd sold 2BTC at $4500 and then bought back in at $3000 you'd have 3BTC.

Fair enough. But seriously - it is an important issue. Various people have worked hard to keep the sky clear of advertising. Not just a million blimps and dirigibles - we absolutely have the tech to project billboards onto clouds now. We have the tech to MAKE clouds. 
If it was a free for all in the sky, looking up would be unendurable. Can you imagine? Jesus. 
No matter what bullshit is going on in the world, *even on a battlefield* you can go to a flat space, lie on your back, and look at the sky and see *nothing*. No human crap. No visual noise. Just blue, or grey, or black, or stars.
(Note: doing this on a battlefield is not a GOOD idea, but it is possible, is what I'm saying. And tracers can be kinda pretty, yeah?)
Being in a situation where you can't see the sky is pretty much universally understood to be bad.

Do you really believe BTC will be worth LESS than it is today, in 10 years?
You know a BIG stock market crash is coming, right? They are all waiting for the hammer to fall and there is trillions of dollars of "value" looking to park somewhere safe.
Gold is a pain in the ass in the age of the internet where you want to do deals in minutes, not hours or days.
The only real "risk" with Bitcoin in the long term is a so far unknown  element coming out of nowhere - a new tech etc.
Like Netscape probably felt in the last days before Google. 
So stay vigilant for something like THAT. But really, I think BTC has a good chance of being your actual fortune, forever. You never sell.

Sorry I phrased it poorly. I'm saying Wikileaks (more than him, he's limited in what he can personally do right now obviously) released embarassing DNC emails etc, but then didn't release any substantial GOP emails.
Do we really think the GOP has NO incriminating shit in writing? A party made up of dudes who cheat on their wives, who employee prostitutes, who take bribes etc?
When it comes to the petty shit, the GOP is objectively worse than the Democrats, they just are. So where were the email dumps?
Answer: they are ready and waiting for when Trump pisses off Assange, Putin, Wikileaks or all three.
Note - they won't ever go after Trump personally, he's too valuable as a "spoiler". Assange and Wikileaks and John Pilger and all those people hate America first and foremost and they WANT a series of buffoons to be president now, to reduce US power around the globe.
Trump supporters are playing themselves.
I guarantee in 2020, if Trump quits or dies and the GOP puts forward some boring highly experienced senator (who maybe didn't vote against abortion one time) who had real, highly-detailed economic plans for the country...
...and the Dems put up a half-black, half-Latinx firebrand who screams and railed against Wall St and promised a free ham for all voters, and said they would let gays and transgender people back into the military but that also the US would be pulling out of all international bases etc etc etc...
...then Wikileaks will flip immediately to supporting them and tearing down the GOP guy.
Because for Wikileaks it's not about punishing Clinton or Obama or rewarding Trump. It's about keeping America unstable.

No but there are plenty of places in the world where getting fiat that isn't a) illegal US dollars or b) inflated beyond practical usefulness, isn't something people can take for granted.
For travellers, Bitcoin will end up having greater utility than USD. Random TripAdvisor googling shows Tanzania, for instance, you can use NEWISH USD (2006 or later), and smaller denominations get a terrible exchange rate, and debit cards expose you to ID theft, and credit cards get ridiculous surcharges etc. 
TripAdvisor says "BitCoins" (sic) are in Tanzania, but not widely yet. The fact that Bitcoin is on the list of currencies on TripAdvisor I think is incredible enough in itself!
This will be a Bitcoin Christmas, you wait.
You say you're running a business. Is it in a country that doesn't have insane inflation or a collapsing government or no reliable electronic banking system? If yes, then sure, no surprise you don't care about BTC.
You will continue to not care or pay attention to Bitcoin until the day you suddenly realised you missed out on 20% of sales that day because everyone was saying "oh you don't take Bitcoin? Oh dear..."
And if you are in a retail business, it will be, literally A DAY. There will be a day, I reckon it will be a Saturday, when you (well maybe not you, but let's say a random cafe) will say "Shit, everyone wants to pay with Bitcoins today... I gotta get me one of those BitCoin EFT machines the dude was here last week trying to sell me... damn I hope he's not out of stock..."

If you have secret knowledge that BTC is going down to US$2000 then by all means cash out and then buy back in at $2000 which will increase your total number of BTC for your €5K cash-out.
On the other hand, if you bought in well below what it is today, and you do nothing, and this dip turns around and goes back up to €5K, then you won't be any worse or better off than if it had just gone up to €5K with no dip.
If you are looking to buy more, wait for what you think is the bottom and buy.
Cashing out and walking away at this time is almost definitely not the most economically sensible move as Bitcoin will almost (almost!) definitely come back up again.
The BEST move would have been somehow knowing when the turnaround was going to start and selling then, then waiting for the bottom and buying back in. This would maximise your BTC. 
Which at the end of the day is all that matters: how many BTC you are holding when they reach the price you want.

Real talk: you believed in it enough to buy at $4950. So now it is cheaper, you can buy more if you want, and once it gets back to $4950 you will have more BTC than you would have if it had never dipped.
Think of the math. Imagine you had $10,000 to spend (Heh). At $4950 you bought $5000 worth and got 1.01BTC. Then the price dipped to $3200 and you spent your second $5000 and got 1.5BTC for a total of 2.51BTC.
Alternate timeline there was no dip, in fact the price climbed to $5500! So you got your 1.01BTC the same, but when you spent your second $5000, you only got 0.9BTC. Total: 1.91BTC.
Now the timestreams converge and the price goes  up to $10,000. Both timelines saw you spend $10K, but only the timeline with the dip sees you now holding $25,100 worth of Bitcoin.
Could Bitcoin never never never be worth $10K, or never never never go up again? It's possible. But given the state of the world at large, it seems very unlikely.
At this point in time, the price for fiat doesn't matter. Only the survival of the network, the widening of its adoption, and how many BTC you hold matters

Broadly yes but if you are buying from a registered business of some kind, it just means your "chargeback" options aren't automated any more. You will have to actually contact your country's version of Fair Trading to investigate the merchant. End of the day, they will be able to do forensic accounting that shows an amount of money exactly matching your purchase turn up at the merchant somewhere. 
The merchant can hide this various ways, but if they are using multiple wallets etc etc, this is going to turn from a fair trading investigation into a tax audit.... and if they are clever enough to dodge the law, this is the kind of scam they will only be able to get away with a few times before people start destroying them via social media. Sucks for you this time, but on the other hand if you get into the habit of researching the people you are making big purchases from - "Can CheapLaptops.com be trusted with Bitcoin?" for instance - it should be obvious who shouldn't be given Bitcoins!
There is a LOT of due-diligence we don't do when buying online, because we complacently rely on PayPal's buyer protections, or VISA's chargeback etc. BTC could make everyone smarter about their money.
I also wouldn't be surprised if we see a return of "escrow" services, actually, especially for, say, buying used cars from private citizens. You tx to the escrow account, everyone signs a form saying the money was transferred and received, and you drive off. The escrow company ripping off the seller isn't your problem. :)
As for buying videogames or whatever, maybe we'll see PayPal adapt to take crypto. After all, they are a layer on top of fiat already - using Bitcoin shouldn't make any difference, and if you get ripped off, you can complain the usual ways.
It won't be a free for all for ripoff artists and scammers. Those guys have to stay below a certain level of exposure. Like if you see one cockroach in your kitchen you probably won't run off and call the fumigators... 10,000 pouring out from behind the boiler though...

The main problem with your argument is that if a market finds sufficient utility in a system, changing to a system with MORE utility is actually inefficient.
Changing systems is disruptive. Whether or not other cryptos do MORE than Bitcoin doesn't matter, if Bitcoin already does ENOUGH.
The cost to change systems is too high to make it worthwhile. Bitcoin's transaction speed and cost needs to be worse than just annoying. It needs to actually impede commerce, and it doesn't... yet.


This is the wrong way around. We need to say "Other crypto offerings don't yet provide sufficient additional utility to make switching from Bitcoin worthwhile."
Almost everyone around here wants to complain about fees and transaction times, but that's because they are greedy money-heads who are all "hands of muh coinz!" Out in the real world, buying stuff with Bitcoin means discounts, no bank bullshit, no inexplicable card declines, no "oh the EFTPOS system is down", no "sorry we don't take American Express" and ESPECIALLY no "I know the guy with VISA only have to pay 1% extra but you're on MasterCard so you have to pay 1.5%".

- HW wallets crapping out but I guess it's okay because they just use the recovery seed.
- Storing the wallets for too long until USB becomes obsolete but that's cool because recovery seed.
- Forgetting to check up on wallets from time to time, wallet company goes bust, world shifts to a different recovery seed format.... aaaagh.

I'll put an update in the OP to explain this: the whole "why would you send your bitcoin to someone else's wallet" confusion only lasted a moment, until I went on to explain more or less what you said at the beginning of this post.
As for the input-output and UTXO stuff - excellent clarification thank you, helped me out as well actually. Obviously I didn't get into the multiple-outputs thing with my dad over the phone, not least because until your post here, I was still a little hazy on how that part worked!
Stepping back for a moment: I've managed to hammer into my brain that Bitcoin is based on earlier ideas like hashcash etc, or rather that it combines a number of concepts - blockchain, hash, transaction record, diminishing "inflation", difficulty adjustment etc etc - yet I always seem to forget the one about how "coins" are really a transaction record that goes all the way back to the beginning*
*or at least to the part of the blockchain where they snip off bits to save disk space, and only the header is left? Is that right? I feel like that's not quite right... [consults white paper] Shit I still don't know.
In fact etymologically, using the word "coin" for this makes good sense because "coin" actually means "cornerstone". The bitcoins are the cornerstone of the whole system - they are what allow value to move around...
...aren't they?
Sigh. At least my computer knows how Bitcoin works!

Why does everyone seem to think DPRK will actually nuke someone? The ONLY THING stopping us from reducing Pyongyang into a puddle of low-quality Russian export glass, is that we, in the West, have this quaint idea that millions of innocent North Koreans shouldn't have to die because of their leadership's insanity.
Why do African despots routinely go to war with whoever is closest? Because they know the US doesn't really give a shit. Why hasn't DPRK shelled or bombed or done ANYTHING to South Korea for 50 years?
Because they know, if they take off the gloves, we will burn off their fucking hands.
Seriously can you imagine the response? China is not going to say "now now Japan, just because the North Koreans destroyed one of your cities and killed four million people, doesn't mean your friends the Americans should respond."

On this subreddit "the moon" means a massive final value for 1.0BTC, high enough that the world will probably price it in mBTC, not whole Bitcoins.
If you don't believe that outcome is possible, what are you even doing here? What's the point of owning Bitcoin right now if they don't increase hugely in value? Are you converting some portion of your fiat each pay for spending purposes?
The point here is that for some people the "reward" of messing around selling out and buying back in and pay all those fees over and over isn't worth the risk.
All you bear sellers talk as if you sell once at the ATH, and then buy back in precisely at the bottom of the trough (or at least near it). But you don't. You're not like that at all. You sell and buy and sell and buy over and over and your position gets nibbled away by fees.
Again, you probably end up richer when you finally use your money to buy stuff, but some of us don't want that stress! We bought our 2BTC because we believe that will be worth $200,000 one day, and whether it cost us $400 or $4000 or $10,000 to get that $200,000 just doesn't matter that much.


WTF does this mean? Whenever you stop buying BTC, the BTC you hold will have cost you a specific amount. $8600 is $8600 whether you spent it all at once, or if you bought in bits and pieces that add up to $8600. I just didn't put in a realistic total spend - probably more like $8578.37 - because the arithmetic was too hard.

Isn't this kind of true of US dollars right now? The vast majority of us just suck down whatever value "our" dollars are on any given day. But some people will smuggle dollars into places that are in need of a currency that's more predictable than their own, hyperinflated local fiat.
So sure, people in a war zone will buy Bitcoins from smugglers for whatever the black market decides. But rest of us living under the rule of law are stuck with a "pegged" BTC value.
(This is in a reality where the government says that paying more than $200,000 per BTC is illegal - or rather, that if someone asks for more than $200K for 1.0BTC, you can report them to the Department for Fiscal Stability or something - sure it's still possible to pay more, but unlike now, doing so makes you a criminal even if you believe the law is unjust etc.)

Sorry how will hodling get you pennies once the price goes back up?
If you have 2.3BTC today, you will have 2.3BTC tomorrow.
Your technique is good - it lets you buy more Bitcoin. 
But the price of Bitcoin TODAY doesn't matter IF you believe it will be worth $100K+ in the future. 
Let's say you sold 2BTC at $4300, making $8600.
Then you spend all of that at $2500, making 3.44BTC.
You got an extra 1.44BTC, great! But if Bitcoin then crashed out and dies, you're in no better position than anyone else. 
If Bitcoin goes to the moon and we get that amaaaazing million dollar coin (snort) then you have $3.44m and we only have $2.0m. Oh noes! And your BTC  bet made you $400 per dollar invested!
Now, we could have bought our 2.0BTC at $5000, so we spent $10,000 and only made $200 per dollar invested, damn. 
But for all you know, we bought our 2.0BTC at $500. Which means we made $20,000 per dollar invested! Woooo!
What if BTC never gets above $10,000? Then you've made $4 per dollar, and we've made $2 per dollar.
You know what? I can live with that.

No you misunderstand. Bitcoin cannot be instantly accepted by every merchant, but that doesn't mean it will never be accept NOR does it mean current rate of adoption is slow or indicative of imminent failure.
No electronic transaction of fiat is REALLY instant. It just seems that way. Bitcoin right now is in a very early phase in terms of its application. The fundamentals are there, people who like messing with private keys and tx addresses etc can use it.
When normal people get to it, functionally it will be the same as a credit card, just with a B on it instead of VISA.

I haven't decided what I think about this, for long term hodlers.
Say you have *absolute faith* that Bitcoin will be worth $1m per coin, one day. And you want $3 million to retire on.
So that means you need to hodl 3.0BTC.
Let's say this dip goes all the way down to $3800.
If you buy them at $3800, it costs $11,400.
If you miss the dip and buy them at $4200, it costs $12,600.
A difference of $1200 ain't much to worry about against $3 million.
BUT! On the other hand, let's assume you are able to invest $15,000.
$15K at $3800 is 3.9. $15K at $4200 is 3.5.
So if you buy in at $3800 you will be $400,000 better off when (WHEN GODDAMNIT!) Bitcoin hits $1 million.

No, no it makes no sense to call this painful unless you are a short term trader. If you are a short term trader it is painful.
If you bought in the early days, who cares.
If you bought on September 1, well this shit will toughen you up because obviously when you bought at the ATH you did so in hopes it would go higher.
If you just got in in August, and your plan is to hodl long term, then this dip is FUCKING FANTASTIC.
If you have a 5-10 year plan, THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME for you is for Bitcoin to crash down to $1000 and then go up to the promised $100,000-$1,000,000 slowly and sustainably over the next decade or more.
You want it to crash to $1000 so you can buy more BTC!
All that matters is how many BTC you hold when it reaches its peak price in the year whatever.
And if $5000 was the highest it will ever get, and if this is the end today, well then fuck it. It was worth the fucking ride.

It may shock you to know that some of us, if the government passes a shitty law, won't immediately start breaking that law. Not because we like the shitty law, rather its because we don't want to, you know, get busted. Are we cowards? I guess. But for some of us it's just because we have kids. I'm prepared to back Bitcoin with my income, but... sorry I won't go to jail for it.
I get that there will always be black markets, but life is generally easiest in a society where you can get whatever you need without having to rely on a black market.
Anyway, I guess I'm not really asking if a Bitcoin-hostile third party (ie a govt) can oppress it, because of course they could just say "it's illegal to use Bitcoin in America" or something.
More like, what happens if we get not so much a 51% attack, as a 51% "we're going to peg the value of Bitcoin against a currency we choose".
Can the system stop that? I get that right now, the politics of the people who decide Bitcoin's underlying technology means that wouldn't happen, but who knows how people would react after, say, a serious change in global circumstances? 
Like, China and US say to all the miners "okay guys, you can keep doing this but you have to follow the following rules..."
You see how it could be subtle? I don't know. Maybe I'm overcomplicated it.
Perhaps I mean: what if a majority of miners decide to betray the principles of Bitcoin in some way? What's the solution to that?

^36 And God also said "By the way if you dig around in the dirt you might find some shiny yellow stuff, that can be money too. ^37 But nothing else okay!"
^38 And thus was created money.

That's a very simplistic reading of the sub-prime mortgage crisis. What happened was that too many homes were built, more than enough to meet demand.
So the value of the homes was not going to go up through simple supply-and-demand. So dodgy banks knowingly decided to try to get people to take out mortgages on these homes *in full knowledge* that the interest paid on the mortgage would not be offset by the rise in the home's value.
They sold so many cheap mortgages they ran out of customers. So they started signing up people who they knew could not pay for the mortgages (because bank peeps were getting paid bonuses for signing people up, creating an incentive to fudge incomes and ability to repay).
Then the banks figured out that a whole lot of people were going to default their mortgages, lumping the banks with whole bunch of worthless properties (because in the US - generally - you can just give the keys to the bank and say sorry can't pay, in other countries the bank sells the house and comes after you for the balance).
So the banks cooked the books and tried to sell the debt (the mortgages) to other companies. It became all about who was going to be left facing into the wind when the shit hit the fan.
When the market finally admitted the mortgages were worthless (remember, a mortgage generates income for a bank through interest payments) the system collapse. The collapse infected other parts of the economy and the rest is history.
Exactly what aspect of Bitcoin do you think is a conscious lie, where people are going to wake up tomorrow and say "hang on... I have to pay another $500 for the coins I currently hold today and I don't have any money."
If you hold coins you paid for them. If you took a loan and are going to default on that loan, that's outside Bitcoin's network and not Bitcoin's problem - you will sell your coins back into the system and the price will go down, but there's no current possibility that a giant percentage of the network is suddenly going to go "HAHA all those transactions that pushed up the price never really happened!"
Bitcoin as an investment may not be special, but it's *different*. Your purchase of a coin cannot be fucked up by Bitcoin's CEO embezzling funds and running away to the Caymans. Nor can it be fucked up by a bunch of employees of Bitcoin making false entries on the blockchain. It's just... not the same.
As to it being a Ponzi... if everyone suddenly tried to exchange all their coins for fiat, the people who break first will get cashed out, and the price will drop fairly rapidly. But we won't have "Bitcoin central" saying "Um... actually I know we said the market cap was $80 billion but actually there's only $2 billion in the bank so... uh... yeah... bye!"
The coin is worth $4900 (or whatever) right now because someone just this minute paid nearly $4900 for a coin (or portion thereof. Yes, there isn't enough value in the whole system to instantly cash everyone out at $4900. But neither is it all built on lies and fairy floss. People bought these coins with real money over time.
Crucially, Bitcoin itself cannot lend me money to buy Bitcoins. This happens to other financial products, and it's what sows the seeds of collapse. All Bitcoin's funding is from people who actually bought Bitcoins. There's no "seed capital" that has to be paid back. No "dividends". You will never get money out of Bitcoin without giving up some of your Bitcoin. That's important.
Even more importantly, your Bitcoin will always be worth the same as mine. I can't have a "less valuable" Bitcoin, there's no system like you have to hold your Bitcoin for a month before it "matures" or whatever. If THAT was part of the system, then it could be a Ponzi scheme - the money I paid would go to your Bitcoin to "top it up" and mature it so you could use it. And I would hope the next people buying in would "top up" my Bitcoin. 
Yes, people buying in increase the value of our Bitcoins, but the new people's coins are also instantly at that value. 
There's no way SOME people withe Bitcoins can win while other people with Bitcoins can lose. The only way to "lose" is to hold your Bitcoins for too long in a rout and not sell out until you're in a situation where only a few people are left wanting to buy them.
That's not Ponzi or Pyramid. That's supply and demand.

Hopefully you are asking this question BEFORE you buy a wallet!
One of the best things about crypto is that, unlike cash, losing your wallet (or dropping it in your morning OJ) DOESN'T mean your coins are gone... necessarily.
When you get your hardware wallet, the first time you plug it in, it will generate a 12-24 word "recovery seed". This is a bunch of random words that you write down on a little card. And then you store that card somewhere VERY VERY safe. Such as in a safe.
If the wallet gets nicked, lost, craps out, or indeed simply becomes obsolete (the USB plugs on today's wallets may be obsolete 5 years from now), don't panic.
Just buy a new wallet, then select the "recover wallet" option. Type in the seed words and poof! Your coins are magically there again.
Now, the new wallet has to be seed-compatible with the old one (each wallet explains the requirements) and most importantly of all - NO ONE ELSE must be allowed to use that recovery seed on another wallet!
If your recovery seed is stolen, even if your wallet is just fine, someone could use it to "recover" your coins to their own, new, wallet. 
As for having your wallet stolen, to access your coins, the thief has to defeat your PIN first. If you use a 6-digit pin, it's pretty tough. Why? Because each time they guess the wrong PIN, the wait time to try again increases by a power of 2. Pretty soon they are waiting DAYS between guesses.
That gives you time to go "OMG my wallet!" and order a new one. I'm a little troubled by the way you need to have a new wallet standing by before you can recover the old one, but hopefully in the near future these things will be sold in shops. 
Until then, that's the only risk - that a thief will somehow crack your PIN before you get a new wallet to recover your old one to. Very, very unlikely.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin aren't really "stored" anywhere. A "wallet" is software that lets you transact with Bitcoins that have been directed to one of the wallet's addresses. Each wallet has a set of private and public keys. The public key is for your receiver's wallet to check that the private key is valid without having to actually SEE your private key (so the person receiving Bitcoin from you can't get your private key in anyway)...
...although it's not QUITE like that either. But for day to day use, don't worry about "public keys" and just know that your BTC is usable by anyone who DOESN'T have the private key associated with the wallet the BTC is associated with.
Eventually exchanges/banks will be safer than hardware wallets because banks will be insured up to some value. So if BTC does become just another currency like USD, you will keep it in a bank. If the the bank gets hacked, you'll be compensated up to some limit - in Australia with fiat, it's up to $250,000. Our govt. gives you that if your bank collapses.
A hardware wallet is safe like a, well, safe. It is vulnerable to  "rubber hose cracking" where a thief comes to your house and hits you with a rubber hose until you give him the hardware wallet and the wallet's PIN.
So if you do end up with a substantial amount of BTC, touchwood a million bucks worth or more, it will be very important not to tell anyone.

If you bought in 2010 and still have your original purchase now, you have not lost any money. Fact. There's no qualification, like "farmers who used the latest irrigation techinques were able to benefit from booming grain prices, while those who did not use the new techniques did not profit". Every single person who bought in 2010 and hodled until today made money (at least on their Bitcoin, outside in the real world I have no idea of course).
The concept of "chance" doesn't apply to past events.
Look, I know there's a natural instinct or whatever to calculate risk by pretending you are in the past looking at where you are in the present. But anything you say about being in the past predicting the present is meaningless. In fact, to make it seems like a person in the past was taking a risk of losing their money, you have to consciously ignore the actual outcome that really happened. You have to invoke parallel universes, all that.
Again, I'm not arguing that at the time he did not take a risk. I am arguing that it was not "idiotic". He looked at data, he made a calculation, he took the risk and it paid off.
There's this weird confabulation of "risk" and "foolishness". That if you are taking any risk, it's in some way a silly thing to do. Throughout the history of commerce, it has been demonstrated over and over again that if you want serious profit you have to take a risk.
Taking a risk, even a big risk, is not idiotic.

The tulip mania was completely insane, unplanned, undirected, and the eventual collapse of the market was caused by many factors *including an outbreak of bubonic plague*.
Shit was cray, dog.
Anyway, newly independent-from-Spain Netherlands blah blah, introduction of tulips as a novel luxury / status symbol from Turkey yada yada, bulbs get a virus that makes the flower bloom with cool stripes, beedle beedle, everyone went nuts, people started buying and selling tulip futures, bulbs were changing hands 10 times a day with no actual deliveries of actual bulbs...
...and then in February 1637, buyers started to refuse to come to the auctions to actually pick up the tulip bulbs (partly because of fear of, as stated, *bubonic plague*), and the whole thing collapsed.
What's interesting is that modern examination of the period has suggested it was more of a crazy social phenomenon and didn't have an especially ruinous impact on the Netherland's wider economy. Plenty of people lost it all, of course, but it didn't crash the ENTIRE system.
Anyway, the point is that tulip mania was unplanned, there was no forward-looking management, it had no underlying purpose or mission, it was amplified by weird random events mostly centring around pathogens (Tulip-breaking virus and *bubonic plague*) and literally nobody knew WTF was going on.
Contrast that to Bitcoin. Designed, well-thought-out, forward-looking. It has a mission - to be a trustless (or trust-lite) peer-to-peer digital currency with no central bank. It has parameters (on 21 million coins), and it has day-to-day functionality - buying shit.
Also, at least compared to Tulipmania, there's always a REASON for its price. Why would lots of small transactions increase? Because more merchants start accepting it. Why would the overall price go up? Because more people want to use it as a store of value.
Perhaps most importantly, the supply of Bitcoin is automatically managed by the system itself. Coin mining - inflation - occurs at a set pace, and if it starts going to fast the system increases the difficulty of mining new coins. If it slows down, difficulty falls too. 
Day to day, Bitcoin's price can display elements of Tulipmania. If it spikes to $20,000 by COB tomorrow, yeah that's probably a bit of a bubble. But over the long term, its price rises steadily and sensibly, and in a way that can be explained by looking at the wider global economy.
The world does a finite amount of work each year. We want to exchange that work with each other using money as an intermediary so we don't need to rely on "double co-incidence of wants". Something has to be money - bits of metal, pieces of paper issued by a bank, a bunch of digital tokens that are self regulating.
If Bitcoin dies, it will die because it has been made obsolete by better technology. There is no contingency where everyone suddenly wakes up and goes "wait a minute! These digital coins don't do anything! WTF am I even messing around with them for? DUMP!"

Few modern taxes were created as deliberate attempts to "profit". Most are created a desperate attempts to keep the lights on. When govts are flush they tend to cut taxes, few (sustainable) governments tax exponentially...
As for enforcement of income tax, I don't really get how BTC is different to cash in this context? I can get my employer to pay me "off the books" but if I get audited, the govt is going to be all "how are you paying for this house and those two cars and those two kids and all these consumer goods?"
As far as I can tell, forensic investigation of BTC transactions could even be EASIER than trying to track bags full of cash. You find out the amounts and the time they were supposed to have been paid, you examine the blockchain - you find a 134.45343BTC transaction registered at 4.37pm, like when your snitch told you the deal was going down etc etc etc...

I think you gotta make a call on how far you think it will go. Is the top going to be $10K? (Probably not.). $100K? (Maybe) $1 million (Not impossible but...).
If you think it's going to double from what it is now, then $50 won't do much. Going up 10x is meh too. Think it's going up 100x? Then maybe try to put in a couple of grand. If you think it's going up 1000x then, well, that is definitely worth a bigger risk.
Never risk an amount that will leave you severely messed up if it fails (or if you suddenly need the money, like for medical stuff or something, during a big slump, because there WILL be big slumps).
But on the other hand if you play it super safe you won't get the big rewards. Are you prepared to make a bet that means, if you are wrong, you won't get to have a car in your 20s like all your mates?
Personally I believe in risking enough that, if it turns out you were wrong, it gives you a solid kick in the ass and you learn a lesson, but you aren't ruined.

Curious to know how you think any currency got its value? I mean sure, the trading on foreign exchange sets the precise value today, but why does a Cheeseburger cost, like, $3.25 rather than $4.27 or, hell since we can just print money, $44,533?
Aren't were merely in a phase with Bitcoin where we are establishing its initial value? Other currencies they did this by, as they say, fiat. A government said "Right you lot, this is a dollar, we got the idea from Spain, and it's going to be worth like six ounces of silver. We all agree that a prize hog is worth six ounces of silver, right? RIGHT? So you go and work everything else out for yourselves. Also, I get the most dollars to start because I'm President."
Something like that, anyway. (Sorry I was too lazy to look up what the initial value of the dollar was and how they set it, but the point is, some dudes got together and said "this much yeah? We'll make it worth this much? Okay. Okay you tweet it. No YOU tweet it...")

Yeah it does self regulate, actually. Because unlike all the other great crashes of history, there's no "truth" hidden behind the glitz. There really are 16.5 million Bitcoins mined so far. Any Bitcoin I try to sell today, I will get something very close to $4700 for. When I say "sell one BTC please" no one is going to say "um... actually... there is no market for Bitcoins and your money is totally gone, dude."
This is, in essence, what happened in all the other crashes. People said "okay I want to turn my investment into money now" and the people running the companies said "er... sorry, there isn't enough money."
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:26:24
Walk me through this metaphor. 
So someone buys at, say, $3400 yesterday. Then the price 'crashes' down to $2900 and they hodl. What happened today? What's the price right now?
The last 48 hours has demonstrated TO A TEE that hodl is a valid strategy for zero risk. Yes, do try to avoid buying at the top of a spike because it will take longer to break even, but if you buy halfway down a slope, there is nothing to worry about.
Hodl is only "wrong" if it infuriates you that, looking back at the historical price, you can identify optimal places to trade to increase your total number of coins or to take fiat profit from your existing coins.
Some of us though are like "we have our position... this is fine."

Oh I see, it's the classic internet "we were talking about a specific thing, but you said something that makes me look bad so I will widen the scope of the argument to include my entire life so you can see I'm actually awesome."
If we LIMIT the discussion to the specific act of depositing, waiting, and then withdrawing crypto, you did indeed just give them some fiat and sit on your butt, okay? I don't care what else you did with your life before or after that specific event. 
Do you disagree that depositing, waiting and withdrawing represents a smaller amount of *work* (in an economic sense) than operating an exchange, with employees, website costs, bandwidth costs, insurance, customer support, blah blah, over any given period of time? Yeah? They did more work than you, but you get to bank way more profit.
An extreme example: you say that if I give you $1000, you can build a house and we can sell it for $100,000. So I give you the $1000, you build the house (or hire other people to build it, whatever), then you sell the house, and I say "thanks!" and take the $100,000. Because I'm not a bastard, I give you $2000 as a cut. Would you be happy with that? Would you think it was fair? Or even if you can some scheme with the contractors that meant you kept 2% of all their fees and you actually ended up with $15,000, would you still think it was fair that I got $85,000 simply for giving you $1000 while you did all the work?
The rest of your comment is more sensible, because it argues about the size of the profit and where the profit is taken. Personally I agree that Coinbase's fees feel a little high compared to other exchanges I can use, but you are giving the impression that you think this company should NOT charge the highest possible profit its market will bear.
I don't know if you are a Libertarian yourself, but most of the people in this place fall toward the free-as-possible market end of the spectrum. If you believe in a free market, you can't say "the profit they are taking is morally wrong" you can only say "I am concerned their margins are unsustainable because there are too many other exchanges that charge lower or no withdrawal fees."
You see what I'm saying? It's the bullshit machismo "you bastards!" emotive language that's so annoying. They are 100% entitled to say "gimme 1.5%" and if you don't want to give them 1.5% then you take your business elsewhere.
If the entire industry colludes to set all withdrawal fees at 1.5% everywhere, well shit, maybe a little regulation ain't so bad after all huh?
But back on that VC cash... like... how do you think VC works exactly? You know that if VC gives them $200 million, that VC expects *more* than $200 million back at some point, right?

Bitcoin is not like poker. Poker has randomness (well, to a point). The movement of Bitcoin SEEMS random, but is isn't, it's the result of the combination of lots of different people making decisions.
It's idiotic to think that Bitcoin "must crash because everything crashes". THAT is results oriented thinking too. It's idiotic to think "since I am taking a really big risk, it MUST mean that I will lose money." That's... I don't know what kind of thinking that is, but I see it all the time. 
This place is great how it really hammers home the message of don't buy more than you can afford to lose. But the fact is, when it comes to investing, the people who make the most money will always be the ones who take the right risk at the right time.
COULD he have lost it all? Sure. But DID he? No. Does this mean WE should immediately mortgage our houses to buy Bitcoin? HELL no. Does this mean that if we did do that though, we would definitely lose money? Also no.
The likelihood right now is that anyone who buys big into Bitcoin is going to end up with a lot of money if they hold for 10 years. Am I going to mortgage my home? No. Is it because I know I will lose money? No, it's because I'm a coward. Or more fairly, because I don't want to expose my family to even the slightest risk of being out on the street.
But I know, on the day BTC hits $100K, I will be thinking "damn, I should have spent $50,000 instead of $5000".

Okay so people are born everyday right, so it's not like we all fit into neat little generations BUT...
Every 30-40 years or so we reach these generational tipping points. The wartime generation had to give way to the boomers (who they called a bunch of useless hippies who would never amount to anything) and the boomers are just now getting seriously into retirement and being rich and shit.
Meanwhile gen X doesn't care because they've seen the worst of the war vets, the worst of the boomers, the worst of themselves, and the worst of everyone born since.
But gen Ys and millennials are now coming into their own. Not just of age, but actually starting to get a bit of power an influence.
In politics they are fucking up because they run around sucking up to boomers and older crusties.
But when it comes to making genuinely new stuff that is going to move the civilisation forward, it's people born after 1980 who are doing by far the bulk of the work now, maybe with a few visionary mentors from the very late 60s or 70s.
People like this guy and others advocating next-gen tech simply cannot communicate it to old people who think they've seen it all.
To so someone aged 70, the idea of the world completely changing again is hard to comprehend. It's counter-intuitive because they've LIVED through MASSIVE change already, but something happens to the brain, I think.
A 70 year old was born in 1947 so they've seen everything from colour television to moon rockets to computers to internet to smartphones come along and I think their brains are just wrung out.
They cling to the few "constants" in life - money is what it is, gold's "intrinsic value" as a thing you can make necklaces out somehow means giving in value isn't arbirtary, gay marriage will kill children etc.
I am 40 and 70 year olds STILL try and lecture me on how the economy works. My boss thinks $5000 is still a generous payrise. 
TL;DR: I say don't even bother trying to convince boomers and older people. Let 'em stew in the fiat, there will be fiat for many years yet. They're all furiously spending their net worth so their useless kids don't get any of it (something that would have been unthinkable to the wartime generation), so I say let 'em.
The stock market is due to melt down, and after that we'll be ready to help them pick up the pieces.

Why is it important for you to believe Bitcoin is “not a thing”? Are you asking us to convince you otherwise, is this question asked in good faith, or are you “sealioning”, just looking for an opportunity to scream down anyone who disagrees with you?
Are you an American? I ask because it does seem to be a peculiarly American trait to want to indulge in doom-saying. “ooooh, everything is terrible all the time, Trump/Clinton/ISIS/Obama are coming to get us oooooh!”
What would make you happy right now? 1000 upvotes and dozens of comments saying “hell man, you’re right and I’ve sold all my BTC because of you!” Would that give you a thrill?

What made me especially angry was that I was flying a drone at that moment, and I was being super diligent and careful to stay below the legal max height, keep the drone within the max distance from me, and more than 30m away from people "not involved with the operation".
I respected the sky, and I limited the use of my (let's be honest) toy to stay within the law.
Then these cowardly fucks who think they should be allowed to write all over our sky to push some agenda I don't even give a shit about (not that this makes it any better or worse) come along.

However, what IS useful to learn from this video is that if the graph has just jumped massively in a very short period of time, maybe wait a bit for price to ease off before making any large purchases.
Because, and especially, in his last example, if you spent $1000 at the peak in 2013, you'd have a little less than 1.0BTC. But if you spent $1000 in May 2015, you'd have more than 4.0BTC.
Which means today you'd be worth $16K+ instead of $4k+.
So Bitcoin's "crashes" are worth trying to pick, especially if you can't cost-average with lots of smaller buys for some reason. And there's also the chance of the veeeery long and veeeeery slow recovery, like after the 1929 crash.
(To be fair, a properly diversified portfolio in 1929 would have apparently recovered by 1936, but if you were only holding stocks from the Dow, it would have taken until I think 1954-ish to get back what you'd lost.)

No, the blockchain doesn't know anything about money actually. All it knows is that there are these "tokens" that can be divided up in 100 milionths, and they have addresses, and they can be sent to different addresses within the blockchain.
When you buy a Bitcoin, what you're actually getting is a bitcoin or fraction thereof, put under the control of your private key. Your private key lets you send your Bitcoins to a different address on the blockchain.
Anyway, the blockchain itself knows where every bitcoin is. None of them are lost to the blockchain, they are just "lost" in the sense that nobody has the private key to do transactions with those coins.
The blockchain tells us - specifically it tells the miners and the people running full nodes - how many bitcoins currently exist, how many are left to be mined (ie created), and it can tell us how many transactions were done in a period, and some other things.
In fact I'm pretty sure with a service like Blockchain Explorer you could probably work out which coins - or rather, which addresses contain coins that haven't moved in years. You can't be sure it's not just someone holding coins for investment, but if you can see an address with 1000BTC on it that hasn't moved since 2010... pretty good odds those coins are "unloved" by anyone right now.
It's weird, that's for sure. It will be interesting to see if they come up with a solution for it.

The correct answer is:
"Now I have built my factory in Dongguang and have a good supply source of plastic, and a license to export, I can make anything to sell to America. What shall I make? 
Perhaps I shall make some plastic money. I have heard of this, and I know American children play with plastic money in their dollhouses and pretend shops - and after all I am also making a plastic cash register. This will be a good product to support my other product."
"And there is a lot of criticism right now that plastic toys are not good, and we must restore faith in the Made in China brand. I attended a trade show last week where they said making EDUCATIONAL toys was the future."
"So I shall brand my plastic money as suitable for education, and I will include it in the next shipment because the deal I have with the distributor in America is to sell plastic toys by the tonne, not by the specific kind of toy."

Also not quite right. Bitcoin doesn't "transfer" coin, the private key creates an input which "spends and destroys" the coin at the wallet's address, and then creates (or causes the system to create? This part is hard), anyway, NEXT, there comes into existence let's say, "unspent transaction output" at your shopkeep's wallet's address.
So the metaphor is you burn your coin, and an identical amount of coin magically appears in your shopkeeper's wallet. *It's witchcraft*....
Then it all gets super straightforward beause the end result of this whole process is that the transaction is confirmed ~~on the~~ as being a valid part of (?) the blockchain, where anyone can check and be certain that this coin hasn't been spent previously.

Hodlers say "No I will not sell you my Bitcoin until you are prepared to give me a million bucks for it." and eventually over time everyone agrees that 1.0BTC is worth AN AMOUNT, and we go from there.
It's... democratic right? We're deciding what the value of our currency is, as a community right? Every currency at some point has to have an initial value set, they don't just have value based on some fundamental property of the universe.
"Yeah it's based on amounts of gold." Sure, and silver, but how much? Why was one dollar set to X amount, not Y amount?

Anyway, even though I know you know how credit cards work, your posts make you SOUND like you think they are magic. Credit cards are IOUs, your bank and the merchant's bank settle up at the end of the day (or whenever). You KNOW this.
The correct comparison is using your phone to do a direct deposit of $11.23 to the merchant's bank using your banking app. You stand there tapping away, entering PINs, selecting accounts, then you do the transfer and you have to show the merchant the confirmation, maybe let them write down some codes or whatever.

Um... and what happens when you want to SPEND that Bitcoin?
You have to get out your paper wallet and type the private key into a computer. Whenever you type a private key, there's a chance a keylogger could intercept it.
This is why HW "wallets" were invented. Really, it's still a software wallet, it's just that a quarantined nano-PC "signs" the private key when you do TXs.
A HW wallet never connects to the internet. What are the attack vectors you are considering?
As for the PIN, you know if you get it wrong three times, it starts making you wait, and each further wrong attempt, it increases the wait time by a factor of two.
So busting an 8-digit PIN through brought force will take, literally, years.
HW wallets are delivered in boxes sealed with tamper-singalled stickers. If the stick looks messed, get a refund. 
The KeepKey, for instance, is also sealed with epoxy so opening it destroys it. The EPROM chip that holds the firmware has had its fuse deliberately blown so you can't flash it with a fake, malicious firmware.
And besides all of this, if you think your wallet has been stolen, immediately recover your BTC to another wallet using the recovery phrase the HW wallet generates when you set it up.
"Cracking" a reputable HW wallet is simply impractical for all but the kind of organised crime that has such massive resources, they'll skip the silliness and just grab you and hit you with a wrench until you give them the PIN.
At the end of the day, when you're bleeding in the gutter, NOTHING is totally secure.
But on the other hand, sure man keep using paper wallets. For now they are probably fine, but by the mid-2020s when you're wanting to spend/accept BTC five, six times a day? I think you will consider HW then...
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:08:25
I think it depends on what you think will happen long term. If you think BTC will be worth $1m per coin one day (meh, we can dream), then the worst thing right now is not having any Bitcoin.
If you are surfing the various waves, and building your total amount of fiat, well then  the worst thing is every moment your fiat-equivalent is below what you initially paid. 
If you are trying to short or long, then buying wildly will mess up your results. 
It's one thing to take a punt and be wrong, it's quite another to go "blaargha too hard buy sell buy sell buy!" That's how you whittle yourself away to no BTC and no fiat either.

Just for the sake of helping people know what to ask tech support for: the thing you use to restore a wallet is a "recovery sentence".
The "private key" is normally something you have to type in to authorise a transaction, and the whole point of having a hardware wallet is that the wallet "types in" the key for you so keylogging malware can't steal your private key and thus all your sweet, sweet coinz.
So if you get a hardware wallet, and it glitches or something, and you call/contact the tech support for it, they will tell you how to rest the wallet but they will first ask you to be sure you have your "recovery sentence" to hand.
With a "recovery sentence" safely stored or (somehow) memorised, your BTC can be restored to a fixed wallet, a replacement wallet, or even a wallet from somewhere else that supports the same kind of recovery sentence system.

Do not be swayed by American Defeatism. I *am* a racist but, Americans are always like this. As soon as something mildly bad happens they throw up their hands and say "Well! That's it! Everything's fucked!" Then they sit and sulk.
As a global community we first saw this in WW2. When US platoons were captured, they immediately fell apart and POW guards would come to beat them up, only to find them all beating up their own lieutenants already.
Meanwile the British are in the next hut maintaining uniform discipline and chain of command and all "Oh I say fuck you Gerry."
And the hut over from that is a drunken party full of Aussies, Canadians and other Commonwealth POWs who have brewed moonshine from the varnish on the bedposts and now dedicate their waking hours to making life as difficult as possible for the guards... and the British officers.
(There's a good scene in the old film Gallipolli when the Aussies are training in Egypt I think it is, and the British officers who are in command say "sergeant, tell those men, proper uniform discipline at all times and they are NOT to wear shorts on the beach!" Cut scene to officers surveying the beach as groups of bare-assed Aussie troopers walk by...)

Yes. The govt "pays" 100% of your losses if you are a small business. If the business loses money it doesn't pay any tax, and in Australia it can claim all kinds of rebates etc on equipment and whatnot.
Similarly, if you lose income in the year (ie get a pay cut), the govt will adjust your total tax bill *retroactively* and refund you.

Even if I go to a really expensive place where sundaes are all fancy and cost $12, someone who works at Australia’s minimum wage of $17.70 could, after 175 minutes, afford four of those sundaes. (Well okay, there’s a bit of tax, so call it three.)
As for the kind of people who go to fancy sundae shops, they’re most likely on incomes that could afford 7, 8 $12 sundaes every two and a bit hours.

One of the longest 1 star reviews there is a totally unbelievable fantasy of someone wanting to donate "$10,000 in Bitcoin" to a *preschool* because her "husband's Bitcoin investment was doing very well".
Even if this story is true, we are supposed to believe it is COINBASE's fault that this idiot googled a support number, which was of course a phishing number, and the preschool blithely gave this guy all their details and so "the Bitcoin is now gone from the account".
Just in case we're not clear: this is like me walking up and down the street yelling "HOW DO I DEPOSIT THIS $10,000 IN AN HSBC ACCOUNT?" and then a guy with a nametag written in marker saying BOB/HBSC (sic) comes up and says "Oh I work for them, give me the $10,000" and I'm like "okay!"
And then the next day I'm angry at HSBC.

Dollars aren't valuable? Not sure I understand. Last week I did a week's work and got paid in dollars (Australian dollars, but still). I used the dollars to buy a week's worth of food and pay a week's worth of my mortgage, power, water etc. And I actually had quite a few dollars left over, actually.
Dollars are just a medium to exchange the work I did toward the output of my company, for the work done by the employees of the bank that output the capital for my mortgage, and the work of the people at the power company that output my electricity, and the work of the farmers, and train drivers, etc etc etc.
(Oh and the mortgage? Don't worry about me getting ripped off on interest. Interest rates at the moment are a joke. It's practically free money. My mortgage repayments including interest are LESS than the rent on a comparable house right now because Sydney property is out of control.)
I guess the problem is with those dollars I DIDN'T spend, becuase the work I "stored" in them starts to get eroded away by inflation... and the longer I don't spend my dollars, the less of my work can later be converted into other work.
I don't actually care what number is on my dollars. I just care what my dollars can actually buy. First for survival, then for a little comfort on top of that, and (via dollars saved) various upgrades to my lifestyle. 
It's that last bit that is the problem, right?

AND NOW THE REBUTTAL!
**1. Gold has a 5,000 year history as a long-term store of wealth.**
Bitcoin's lack of cultural and historical baggages means people are rethinking what "store of wealth" means. Also, no one has ever been brutally murdered by having molten Bitcoins poured down their throat.
**2. There is always a ready and liquid market for gold.**
Blackmarket Bitcoin makes no sense as a concept (unless your country bans them I guess?), also that thing about "liquid market" is pretty tasteless, Forbes (see point 1).
**3. Gold can protect you from nuclear radiation.**
Bitcoin can stabilise our financial system such that nuclear war becomes obsolete. Also, Bitcoin essentially runs on electricity which in many places is POWERED by nuclear radiation. *Checkmate, Gold*
**4. Gold is safer.**
It is true that as long as a criminal will only steal $5 million and not one 400-oz (25lb, 11kg) bar, gold is reasonably safe. However, many current Bitcoin exchanges will not let you convert all your BTC to fiat and withdraw it in one go. *It doesn't get safer than that.*
**5. You can wear gold as jewelry.**
Yeah maybe, but no one will ever look down at you for having a Bitcoin tooth or a Bitcoin chain or wearing too many of the wrong kind of Bitcoin rings. Also, no one will ever say "oh, so it's only 14 karat? Oh dear."
**6. Gold is a superb electric conductor**
Again, because Bitcoin runs on electricity, it takes electricity out of the system which makes everything safe. You cannot be electrocuted by Bitcoin.
**7. Gold has never been out of fashion**
Well neither has Bitcoin genius, and anyway gold has always been considered tacky by classy people. I mean what's the one thing *everyone* on all sides agrees is ridiculous about Donald Trump? The giant pile of gold he sleeps on, that's right.
**8. You don't need a web connection to use your gold.**
Look, I have to admit I don't have a smart defence for this. It is undeniably true that when my useless overpriced ISP's service technician with the shaky hands knocked out the internet at my place, I was super-glad I had an 11kg gold bar to pay for my morning coffee, morning bus ride, and morning pornographic magazine. You win this one gold!
**9. Gold never tarnishes**
Are they even trying by this point? Bitcoin doesn't tarnish either you idiots! Also, tarnishing involves electrons and stuff, electrons are in electricity, and we've already established that Bitcoin is just way better at electricity, okay?
**10. Gold is an aphrodisiac**
No, you munter, POWER is the aphrodisiac. And women are sick of hearing "I took my daddy's $100 million and flushed it down the toilet but at least it's a *gold* toilet and I have all these classy gold chest-chains." They are MUCH more impressed with "I found some money in my couch in 2010 and I bought like 12,000 Bitcoins and now I'm worth 20 million... no wait 18.5 million... no wait 19.2 million... no wait 21 million... no wait..."
**11. Bitcoin is clearly in a speculative bubble**
I *speculate* that when the last tree is felled and the last lump of gold slides down the gullet of our new alien overlords, you will realise that only the K'Tarr can eat gold. Bitcoin on the other hand provides 9 essential nutrients and 1500% your daily requirements of salt (depending on overnight market).
**12. Bitcoin is still experimental**
Scientists use gold in experiments *all the time* in fact they use gold in experiments *way more* than they use Bitcoin, so who's experimental now, huh? Also, kids love experimenting with new drugs and new religions and Bitcoin is both so I see this as a win.
**FINAL SCORE:**

Typically when people take out a mortgage they use the money to buy stuff, and then make monthly or fortnightly repayments. If I took out a $300K mortgage right now, I could pay it back easily from my salary. I mean sure, I don't want to have to use my salary for that, but it's possible.
If Bitcoin had tanked, he could have paid back the mortgage for a bit then sold the house for more than $300K. Yeah, he ends up without a house which sucks. And any financial progress he's made up to the point that allowed him to buy a house gets reset, which sucks too.
But no one would have had to come by and break his knees. Also, in the US my understanding is you can say to your mortgagor "Oh I can't pay this any more, here are the keys to the house, see ya." And just walk away.
The US also has reasonably good bankruptcy law compared to many other countries (especially Australia, sheesh, bankruptcy is goddamn mark of Cain here), and some business people won't even respect you without a bankruptcy or two under your belt...

Do not be swayed by American Defeatism. I *am* a racist but, Americans are always like this. As soon as something mildly bad happens they throw up their hands and say "Well! That's it! Everything's fucked!" Then they sit and sulk.
As a global community we first saw this in WW2. When US platoons were captured, they immediately fell apart and POW guards would come to beat them up, only to find them all beating up their own lieutenants already.
Meanwile the British are in the next hut maintaining uniform discipline and chain of command and all "Oh I say fuck you Gerry."
And the hut over from that is a drunken party full of Aussies, Canadians and other Commonwealth POWs who have brewed moonshine from the varnish on the bedposts and now dedicate their waking hours to making life as difficult as possible for the guards... and the British officers.
(There's a good scene in the old film Gallipolli when the Aussies are training in Egypt I think it is, and the British officers who are in command say "sergeant, tell those men, proper uniform discipline at all times and they are NOT to wear shorts on the beach!" Cut scene to officers surveying the beach as groups of bare-assed Aussie troopers walk by...)

Exactly. It's like these hodler-haters forget that a) saving is a thing and b) each BTC can be split into 100,000,000 pieces.
If the price is going up, people MUST be transacting. 
If 1 BTC = $1, then the total supply of BTC is too small to be useful. 
Fore BTC to have smallest unit-to-unit parity with the dollar, the maximum it can be worth is 1 Satoshi = 1 cent (or 1.00000000 BTC = $100,000,000).
That gives a total potential supply of BTC of a bit under $21 quadrillion. Currently the derivatives market is worth, what, $4-$5 quadrillion?
Even today there are enough "markers" in the blockchain to handle a huge chunk of global exchange if we all suddenly agreed to switch to it and peg all currencies to BTC.
And don't forget, adding more divisibility is just a "simple" matter of getting a majority of the network to agree to a software update.

Seriously I wouldn't even worry about it. Unless you are a big time money launderer, the govt doesn't care. When it comes to tax, audits are random, and if they pick you and note you have a Ferrari and a Lambo and six houses in your name or in your old mum's name... you will get off anyway because you will be rich enough to hire a good tax guy.
I mean, I get it, it's the principle of the thing. You should be able to buy fucking socks without there being a permanent record but... there WILL be a permanent record on the blockchain of a pair of socks worth of BTC going to some sock shop on some date.
As far as I can tell, forensic investigation of BTC transactions could be EASIER than tracking cash payments. Think about it. They pull in Jimmy Jo-Jo for gun running. He fingers you as the client. The cops go to the blockchain, they see Jimmy received his 45BTC tx at 8:32pm on Wednesday. They ask you where you were at 8:32pm on Wednesday.
Home? Raid. Computers seized. They find software wallet. They load, shows recent 45BTC transaction confirmed at 8:32pm. Probable cause. Bam. Arrest.
Maybe you're smarter than that. They find your safe, make you open it. Inside: hardware wallet. Load, see above. Probable cause. Bam. Arrest.
Maybe you're smarter than that. Paper wallets hidden in weird paintings on the walls. Why does a tough guy like you have paintings? Obviously coded paper wallets. Send to lab. Lab can't get your private key, but can show judge that it's definitely an encoded image. Bam. Warrant. Arrest.
Maybe you're smarter than that. All wallets hidden super-well. Router examined for recent traffic. Lab identifies as probable access of BTC network. Timestamps indicate packets sent at time that matches with registration of 45BTC on blockchain for the 8:32 confirmation. Bam. Arrest.
Hiding your historical use of the blockchain from proper forensic detectives will be tricky. Maybe not even possible. Proper criminals will make their BTC activity obvious and above-board. ID can be a good friend of the criminal.
Anyway, ID for purchasing BTC is ultimately for everyone's protection. The exchange to stop you scamming them, and you because more and more exchanges are now getting proper insurance etc so if you load up $1000 of fiat, and then exchange collapses, you can register yourself as a creditor and get some of that back.

Even less literally, there is nothing about Bitcoin that "reflects" on Dimon that he is guilty of fraud. He IS guilty of fraud, but Bitcoin did not make the world realise that.
And why the fuck is it eating ice cream? Why didn't they give it a brown lunch bag with "Jamie Dimon" written on it? THAT at least would make sense.
A more sensible comic would have been Dimon threatening Bitcoin with the fraud squad, while he was being hauled away in cuffs by the fraud squad, as Bitcoin sat there calmly eating Dimon's lunch.

Okay at some point I will have to admit this is an argument of logical semantics which is probably unwinnable, but let's try to break it down.
1. Why do we care abou this guy at all?
Because he bucked the doctrine of this place by risking MORE than he could afford to lose.
2. What was his experience?
He made $600K+ before tax.
3. What are our possible responses?
This is where it gets interesting. We can either use his experience to counter-logically insist that risking everything is always really really bad. Or we can USE his experience to understand what risk really means.
To simply dismiss him as "stupid" or "idiotic" is shortsighted and boring. We need to examine the circumstances that led him to making the risk.
Now, apparently (I haven't checked this) this guy was really sick. And that obviously changes his perception of risk and puts him in a situation that most of us don't share. So we need to take that into account.
However, the end result is that his risk paid off. Why? What does this say about Bitcoin? Does it make us look at the big picture and realise, if you hodl, Bitcoin always goes up? What does this *suggest* - not prove, but suggest - about the future of Bitcoin? How does it change our perception of what "don't risk more than you can afford" means?
I'd argue that buying a ticket in the lottery is "idiotic" even if you win $350 million. Because no matter what you do, what you read, what you learn, and even who you try to manipulate, the lottery is random. You cannot know the result. The vast vast majority of lottery ticket buyers - a mathematical singularity, really - don't win.
But with Bitcoin, EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO GOT IN EARLY HAS WON. This is important. This  affects our analysis of the risk.
Past performance is no *guarantee* of future gains. That can be read several ways. But it 100% does NOT mean future gains won't be the same or larger. But buying into Bitcoin now is neither idiotic or stupid. It is a calculated risk based on available data. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:37:10

The best exchanges don't charge at all. Only the network charges you a transaction fee for BTC to BTC.
The fee is based on size in bytes and how busy the network is (broadly). So doing one big transfer while the US is asleep SHOULD be cheaper.
My Aussie exchange charges a flat 0.0005btc per transfer no matter what the network fees are. This means my wallet always gets my BTC within a few minutes BUT it means I am forced to overpay when the network is quiet.
This system backfired on them bad the other week when tx fees were unusually high, so I consider myself ahead right now..
But bottom line: the tx fee is NOT a percentage, so fewer transactions done while the network is quiet WILL be cheaper.

Its so true. I mean the government finds it absolutely simple to follow the money these days through nine hundred offshore whatevers and shell the others and reverse-mortgaged upside town asymmetric trusts and etc.
Blockchain-based money obscures identities but it makes actual transactions completely transparent. 
I suspect it will be relatively simple for investigators to show "probable cause" when they can map a 100BTC transaction to the exact time their witness said he received 100BTC from the suspect.
It won't prove any cases, but it may give judges confidence to issue warrants. The cops know who all the kingpins are, the problem is seeing through their byzantine money webs to get some actual evidence.

Is this post from the future??
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:39:33
Okay just to explain why people are acting all trololol about this...
The problem is predicting Bitcoin's dips and crests. It moves really really fast, and the concern is that the big players have or will have algorithms sitting on it that can react really, really fast.
For us, buying and selling means sending money to an exchange... waiting for them to approve it... buying crypto... waiting for it to appear in the wallet... etc.
Yes each of those things takes mere minutes (though sometimes hours), but it adds up. 
Even worse, many places put limits on how much fiat you can deposit at once. So to do a lot of flipping, you'd have to "load up" your account with fiat, then when you bought BTC, leave them on the exchange too - just so you can move fast enough to flip through the dips.
And each time you are getting hit with fees. 
I think the risk is just too great right now. You could sell at 5300 only to have it bounce straight back up to 5600 - which was pretty much the pattern this last week: three steps forward, two back, three forward, one back, FIVE forward, one back...
It would be so so easy to end up underwater with just a couple of badly timed trades.

The point of this conversation wasn't to establish a basic, workable knowledge of Bitcoin so my dad could spend some BTC on something. It was to explain how BTC is different from fiat currency, and since the movement of money in an economic system is what gives it utility, how "money" "moves around" on the Blockchain.
Unfortunately while your metaphorical understanding of a crypto wallet is fine for describing the practical "spending" of BTC in the real world, it's really for people who don't WANT to understand HOW Bitcoin works, they just want to use it.
For people who want to get some understanding of the underlying technology, your bank account metaphor isn't  really anything at all like how the system actually functions.

Try thinking outside your own experience. The majority of people will never understand how or why crypto works. 
It is hard enough for them to accept that Bitcoin is real money, and impossible for them to understand that Ethereum is kind of like Bitcoin but also not because it does more. Does more? How does a different currency "do more"? We know. They don't.
For most people, if you say "Bitcoin cash" they will think of those actual coins you see used as the image on any mainstream story about Bitcoin. Go out into the street. Ask "what's Bitcoin?" and then ask "What's Bitcoin cash?"
There is no way the general population will ever be made to understand that "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin cash" are two different things, and that Bitcoin cash isn't just the "fiat" version of Bitcoin.

I think a number of people need to step back and remember, despite the 8 years (ish) of prior BTC history, we are still very much at the beginning of this thing.
150GB is a lot for a single home "retail" internet connection. For the internet at large, it's pretty much a rounding error.
Know how much data the internet "creates" (you know, changes or transfers in some way) in a single minute?
Right now I don't know.  But in 2016, it was 640 terabytes. 
You *will* get a multi-gigabit internet connection one day. Before 2030, I guarantee it (unless you live in a war torn country or something, sorry). 
At just 1Gb, you can pull down 125MB a second. That will sync  150GB in 20 minutes.
Even today among people who work with serious data, 150GB is like "a file". Think about how much a 150GB external HDD costs these days (if you can even find one that small).
On top of this, there will be an enormous economic incentive to prioritise super-high-bandwidth connections, especially if - as we hope - multiple cryptos end up mainstream, not just BTC.

Oh you're right, I'm totally a super-rich hard drive collecting freak, and the fact that I, a not-especially-geeky person, have 35TB in my various devices, by no means suggests that the kinds of people who are going to run full nodes will have even more.
As for miners... even after the halvening, a 6.25BTC payout is worth $26K right now, so I suspect they will be happy investing in the 12TB HDD Seagate will release next year.
And the really big fish are no doubt eyeing the enterprise-grade 60TB SSD Seagate put out in 2016. Sure, it's $10,000 or whatever, but the fact that product exists means it will be affordable within a couple of years.
The point is that terabyte-scale storage is *cheap* and petabyte-scale storage is just a matter of buying racks and loading them up with cheap HDDs.

No. Uber is hyperexploitation of workers, a system that takes capitalism to the extreme.
In a classic capitalist system, owners don't just control the means of production, they also provide it. To exploit workers, you at least have to pay to build a factory first.
Uber somehow convinces workers to provide their own capital (ie cars), the money you make as an Uber driver isn't that great, and yet *still* the company has to subsidise each trip and losses often exceed 100% of gains!
It may be a fundamentally uneconomical model, but even if they do somehow figure out how to make it work, it's still centralised and requires an intermediary (Uber) between driver and passenger.
A bank version of Uber would be a bank that has fees a bit lower than a normal bank, but occasionally the bank manager would be too drunk to open the bank, and even when the bank is open all you really ever hear them say in there is how the central network is ripping them off or treating them like crap...
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:59:29
Okay where was I...
**There's no bank.**
This is true, you are responsible for your own BTC, and when you are one dude who has unexpectedly made $2million from the mining you did in college it's one thing. When you are responsible for 20+ employees and their payroll it's quite another.
That size of organisation will employee an accountant, surely. The accountants who are the first to offer crypto services will be the ones who get richest, quickest.
Remember: BTC is like cash. It still counts as revenue. You will have to pay tax on it and, by law, keep books. Again, there is already (cheap) software to do this, like Xero or whatever.
There are tremendous opportunities to fuck up with a big BTC balance, but again what crypto offers is *choice*. If you are a bigger trader like our example, right now you HAVE to have a bank and an accountant. You just do. If you do your own books, you will never sleep. 10 locations? Forget about it!
**Sounds like existing systems really, so why bother?**
If you read Satoshi's white paper, he explicitly defines Bitcoin as a digital *cash* system for internet purchases. It was originally conceived to get rid of, not all fiat, but rather to get rid of PayPal or Verified by VISA or all these other intermediaries that shave off a buck here and a buck there when you shop online.
Yes, it has evolved past that now, but the point is - online transactions was the starting point. I think that's important to remember.
BTC, right now, combines the benefits of cash - it's just you and the customer, over the counter, no one else involved - with the convenience of electronic payments (not having to carry around folding money which can be easily lost or stolen).
There are certain types of tx, like coffee bagels fast food drive through, where the wait to confirm is too long, and the network fee too high. Fine. That's why we need other systems, perhaps Litecoin, perhaps Monero, who knows right now. Perhaps BTC itself will gain this functionality.
But today, right now, BTC is 100% usable to buy, as I personally have, computer parts and cheap medicine from online pharmacies. I actually saved money using BTC because both merchants gave hefty discounts, such was their perception that my BTC would either increase in value or it saved them so much in merchant fees.
VISA costs a merchant a certain amount per month, and there are fixed transaction amounts. If they go above those, they get charged, usually 1.5%, per transaction. BTC network fees are based on size of tx and how busy the network is. If you are spending $1000-equivalent, the fees are way way less than 1.5%. If you are spending $10, well yeah. The fees are too high.
But unlike cash which requires MASSIVE effort to even change the picture on, and unlike VISA which runs for a profit, Bitcoin is constantly being developed to make it faster and "cheaper" in a transaction sense...
**You *can* use BTC today but maybe just to try it out...**
Fiat currencies are so-called because they "start" on a day 0 with some guy (or parliament of guys) saying "This is the dollar. It is made of x oz. of silver and it has the same value as x amount of y (usually gold). Why does it have that value? Because we say so." Gavel falls. Done. Declared by fiat.
From there, fiat evolves, differently in different countries. For instance, in Australia our "fiat" value is defined by the market as the dollar is traded, because we floated our dollar in the early 1990s.
Bitcoin's "initial value" is not yet known. We- the three million of us holding BTC or however many it is - are the equivalent of the old men in the boardroom. But rather than conspiring to declare 1.0BTC worth the current purchasing power of, say, US$14,000, we are trading in a kind of precursor market, "slowly" (compared to a one time declaration anyway!) increasing the value until it reaches a, shall we say, saturation point and the oscillations damp right down.
What will BTC's purchasing power be on that day? I suspect a lot. I suspect "Bitcoin" will be the name of the whole currency, not the name of the unit we transact in. I think that will be em-bits (mBTC) or even - touch wood - satoshis or sats. A satoshi is of course 1/100 millionth of a BTC.
Look, who knows right? I think there are very few people who think this form of public-ledger-no-human-mediator tech ISN'T the future. The *concept* at least, is destined for greatness.
But there are many more who think, or desperately WANT, Bitcoin to fail. I don't totally understand why. Maybe because they are worried a system that grows organically will be just as bad as our current system, which, if you think about it, grew organically.
What does any of this have to do with using BTC at a shop? Fucked if I know! I just got on a bit of a roll there... hehe...

Yes. Every exchange must comply with KYC or "Know Your Customer" rules. Have you signed up yet? If not be prepared to hand over more personal info than anything you've ever joined in your life! Passport, copy of recent bill showing address, some even demand a selfie!
Bitcoin does hide the actual transaction from the authorities, but it just means they have to go back to old-school detective work. Jimmy the Scag is suddenly selling coke at half last week's price... and you're driving around in a new Bentley even though you work at a Starbucks... hmn...
More realistically, the IRS is going to say "we've selected you for an audit and we notice you have $45,000 in the bank, deposited there by MyBitCoinXChange.com yesterday. How much did you pay for those Bitcoins when you bought them?"
And what ever you tell them, they will check against YOUR deposit TO MyBitCoinXChange. A clever clogs could probably bounce their purchases around such that it's hard to tell when you actually bought the coins, and I imagine a few years from now there will be a line in helping rich pricks hide the fact they bought their coins in 2017. "Oh I just bought them last month so they've only gained about 3%, here's your tax Mr nice Taxman!"
Oh and also the IRS is going to get REALLY GOOD at using Blockchain Explorer and similar - they are going to be able to locate specific transactions because all they need is the date and the approximate amount. Then they just get a list of all txs that more or less fit that. Remember, you can see how long it has been since a coin has moved on the blockchain. If the feds know you cashed out 2.375BTC yesterday, they could find where you moved the coins to exchange and look at how many "bitcoin days" were destroyed. If it's a LOT they know you've been hodling for years and probably owe them a shuntload of tax. Ugh.
Bitcoin's "anonymity" is mostly going to protect you from scammers who pay you for something with a credit card and then do a charge back, or who give you a dodgy check, or something. If they do a BTC transaction and you see it registered as pending into your wallet, you can insist on waiting until the tx is confirmed before handing over your stuff.
If the transaction is confirmed, there is NOTHING they can do to scam you. The coins are yours.
Note this also applies in the opposite direction - if you give a scammer your coins, and the tx confirms (even if it just registers, realistically), you are boned.

Do I do a lot of business with Coinbase? No thank Christ. Tonight I tried to log on. It told me I needed to reauthorise my PC. So it send me an email. And then when I clicked the link it said the code was invalid.
If I had more than about $100 worth of coins on that exchange right now I would not be sleeping tonight. Because when I went to the "submit support ticket" page, it said they were under massive load and might not get back to me for a few DAYS.
In the background, I hear the radio burbling on about middle-class Americans all deciding to buy Bitcoin this week.
The exchanges aren't ready for this. Some are I guess, but the ones I've dealt with seem barely able to handle the volume of early-adopter, we-basically-know-how-a-website-works geeks. What is an influx of "May I speak to the manager?" going to do to these businesses?
Oh sure they'll survive, long term. But for the next week or so, hodling might not be a choice.
Seriously guys, if you have significant coin on an exchange right now, consider getting it the hell off, even onto a software wallet like Electrum. Then go order a hardware wallet.

Interesting take.
Here's my prediction: in the decades ahead, when Satoshi's original white paper becomes a "historical artefact" like the work of Malthus, Marx and Mill, there will be a school of ecnomics that *heavily criticises* him (or them) for using words like "cash" and "currency".
Because as software, the Bitcoin network is just a ledger. It's a bunch of markers than can move around (wait, I mean be reallocated. No wait I mean, can be reattributed. No wait...). It doesn't *have* to be "money". 
I suspect economics ~~wankers~~ students of the 2030s will argue about to what extent Satoshi's "prejudice" of Bitcoin as "electronic cash" affected its evolution.
Because humans will *never* run out of things to overthink about...
@_date: 2017-09-03 06:26:00
So let me get this straight. You give them money, they give you Bitcoins, but because they also have to be able to exchange those Bitcoins back for money, they need to keep enough liquidity in their accounts to pay out a percentage of total account holders, no matter what the price of Bitcoin is.
So YOUR stake for this transaction is $11K. They have to have enough cash on hand to pay out you plus at least many thousands more people - so, many millions of dollars. I am not sure what level of cash they are required to keep? Does anyone know?
1.5% seems a pretty reasonable profit to me.
Or are you the kind of person who buys $500 of Bitcoin in hopes it will be worth $50,000 in a few years, yet at the same time thinks a company that is actually offering a service, shouldn't make a profit?

Definitely 100% there will be another "episode" where BTC loses double-digit percentage because of some dumb thing someone said, or because a volcano went off, or Kim Kardashian said BTC was for lame jerks or something else really stupid.
This is the "downside" of an unregulated currency. It still gets regulated by raw market forces, and raw market forces include irrational human mob screaming stampede behaviour.
But for BTC to *revisit a previous low* would be unprecedented in its history. Look at the chart. This is the advantage of starting not at $0 but at "undefined". 
Because BTC never had a "starting value" we are immune to the Genesis FUD of "yeah but at the ICO it was worth $2" or something. 
The distinction is important. BTC didn't start at $0. It started at "hey guys, do you think this could be money?"

There will be BTC bubbles from time to time, as we work toward mining the last couple of million "easy" coins. When there are - someone will know the exact number, but I'll guess - 18 odd million, the network will, at some point, finish "charging up", will stop with the wild fluctuations as people think of their BTC as being their entire fortune rather than their investment that they will one day convert back to fiat.
Will BTC become a reserve-by-default currency? Who knows. Will certain industries pay people in BTC? Almost definitely. You might think: but how can BTC work as the only money for billions of people when there's only 21 million (less actually) of them? Because right now each BTC can be divided into 100 million satoshis... and there's nothing *technically* stopping us from dividing it even further. 
Right now there are 16.5 million (roughly) BTC mined. That means there are 1.6 QUADRILLION "markers" of Bitcoin. There's only about 1.2 trillion US dollars out there in cash, and the biggest chunk o' money on the planet - derivatives - amounts to some number in the low quadrillions.
Point is if 1 satoshi ends up being able to buy what 1 dollar buys, and your annual salary is 50,000 sat, then there is enough "space" in the system for 33 billion people to each have 50,000 sat. Of course, rich pricks will end up holding disproportionately huge amounts (and hopefully WE will be some of those rich pricks - I have no shame), so at some point we will consider adding another zero on the end to make 16.5 quadrillion markers, then 165 quad, then 1.65 *quintillion* etc.
I think in the centuries ahead, this will be the Bitcoin's version of quantitative easing. A Division. Not gradual inflation, but rather BAM, suddenly there's 10x as much in the system and all the trading AIs must, by law, engage special protocols to ease the shock or something. 
And when it gets totally out of control, off in the corner of the internet, at little white paper appears, proposing a new currency based on quantum fluctuations in the spacetime continuum etc...

Exchanges usually have a "spread" where the buy price is somewhat higher than "the" price, and the sell somewhat lower (you are buying and selling - obv. from the exchange's perspective they *buy* for less and *sell* for more.)
It's like any broker's spread, yeah?
There's also usually a percentage for buying in fiat - 1% at my local exchange - does Coinbase charge this if you are buying BTC with Eth or LTC? Can you even do that?
Anyway, right now I strongly believe these fees are worth it. They get spent on servers and security and good shit that protects your coins AND stops the exchange going bust...
Many exchanges are now ensured to return any fiat you have sitting on your account, but I'm not sure your crypto is insured? Anyone?

Yeah because history is full of companies not migrating to the new thing.
No industrialist was ever the first to spend millions on new machine that would revolutionise his production line, and if he WAS the first, he NEVER because massively rich as a result.
As for your hypothetical larger company... what infrastructure exactly do they have to invest in to accept Bitcoin, beyond informing all their lawyers "our suppliers can pay in Bitcoin"?
You don't need special bank accounts, you don't need special machines, you don't need anything except the internet connection you already have. I suppose it would be prudent to spend a few hundred bucks on hardware wallets, but everything else is free.
You're also talking in terms of TODAY, like a big company switching entirely to Bitcoin only on Monday, 25 Sept 2017. Of course THAT'S not going to happen.
Also, do your realise that if you are doing 100% of your transactions with a fee-taking third party (VISA), and you shift 20% of transactions to a lower-fee taking system (Bitcoin), that still saves you money?
Stop thinking in absolutes. Bitcoin will be ADDED to the financial toolbox of Joe's Industrial Hydraulic Supplies, it won't suddenly become his EXCLUSIVE method of gathering revenue.
As for the network fees... the network fees and speed of txs are only a problem for those small bagel shops. For Joe and his $100,000+ hydraulic contracts, there is no way he can get that kind of money transferred to him in 10 minutes, from a different country, for $5.
On the other hand you're probably right. BTC is probably going to die because of reasons.

For all of us with &lt;$1000 to throw into BTC, I'd call us the yolo crowd. What the fuck else good is that much money going to do us? 
But BTC definitely needs the fabled "mom and pop" investors to help push the price up so it becomes a core part of the planet's economic systems.
And I'm saying, if you did have $20,000 and were looking for a moderate risk, high reward investment, BTC looks more attractive at $3000 - because it's looking like it WILL be the future right now - than it was at $700 when it was still "just for geeks".

No it means you suffered an opportunity cost of $3000, minus whatever the fiat value of the PlayStation was. Let's say $499. So you had an opportunity to end up with $3000, but because you bought the PS, you only ended up with a console worth $499. $2501 never made it, but they would have, if you hadn't used the BTC. That's an opportunity cost.
Again with your rent, you incurred an opportunity cost of $2800 by using the BTC instead of fiat. That BTC is worth $3700 (actually $3900 of five minutes ago!) now, and you only have lodging to the value of $900. 
Unless of course both times you replenished your BTC balance soon after. Then you only incurred an actual cost of however much more fiat you had to pay to get your BTC back.
Downvote away, fucktards!

Surely Bitcoin is deflationary as a store of value for YOUR (ie an individual's) net worth? It's not like a high interest bank account where the actual number of "markers" - or dollars - increases due to the bank paying you for access to your money.
Your 1.0BTC just sits there in your wallet (yeah yeah, not really, metaphor) gradually increasing your power to buy more stuff. That seems pretty deflationary to me?
Yes, if you "cash out" now, you can view it merely as an appreciating asset. But if we are thinking it will be an actual day-to-day currency in the future, then today 1.0BTC buys, I dunno, a high end gaming PC, but in 2030 1.0BTC will (touch wood) buy a house.
The difference between that and, say, a bond or a term deposit or something, is important, isn't it? We don't say interest-bearing deposits are "deflationary" because they actually increase your collection of dollars.
Holding 1.0BTC doesn't increase your collection of BTC. It just gets more and more powerful as a way to buy stuff.


You were doing well up until this point, because this sounds dogmatic. What does "unsubstantiated slippery slope fallacy" mean in this context?
I can't really think of an example where deflation of a fiat currency is a good thing. I think Japan has a bit of a deflation problem at the moment? And the result is that they have a labour shortage because while, I assume, some people are saying "huh, noodles are cheaper than ever", others are saying "That job? For that much? No thanks!" I don't know.
Help me out here with an example of "good" deflation. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, I just can't think of how it would work.

I believe it will be a vital pillar in the global economic system of the future. Sorry, but I do.
I do not intend to ever "cash out". I intend to build a family home, financed entirely by Bitcoin, paid in BTC to tradesmen who accept BTC.
I believe we will value other currencies not against 1.0BTC but against 1 satoshi.
I believe anyone who owns more than 1.0BTC today will be setting their descendants up for many generations of prosperity.
I suspect we aren't far from a major meltdown on the stock markets, and I think there's a small but non-zero chance that there will be a day, a specific day, when people who can't convert their fiat to some crypto (not necessarily BTC) really really fast, will simply be left holding fists full of totally useless fiat cash. It has happened before.
Even as the wider world calls us delusional Ponzi victims, I believe we will be vindicated to a degree not even those oil men of the early 20th century could dream of.

I think Bitcoin has been a tough ask for ordinary people for a while. It's one thing to yolo $100 worth of BTC in 2011 and forget about it, only to find an old HDD with "wallet.dat" on it and go "OH MY FUGGFHGH [thump]".
It's another to ask people to spend serious money on BTC when it was, say, $350 or $600 or back to $320 again or $700 or OMG $1200 or OMG THEY'RE ALL CROOKS back down to $250 etc. (Numbers inaccurate, but swings more or less historical).
There's an irony in that ordinary people with, say, $20,000 to invest are going to feel a lot more comfortable buying in when BTC is $3000,  than when it was $300. At least once it reaches and holds $3000, that means it's "real".
Anyone who started buying in, say, August this year, could at least get a hardware wallet with reasonably mature firmware on it, and has a number of exchanges to choose from, and can also get a sense of how BTC behaves and that the recent slump wasn't catastrophic, it was just how this shit rolls.
Yes, spending the same money in January would have given wildly better results, but the point is - would a mom and pop have spent big money on BTC in January? Or would they just have bought a couple anyway?

Do... do you honestly believe the VC funding is a gift? Really? I mean really?
Now, an argument about whether 1.5% is sustainable, or whether they should cut it back to 1% or whatever, that's a sensible argument.
But "they are stealing from momz and popz" is not. YOU (assuming you are a hodler) are "stealing" from the system by exploiting the way the system works. 
If you have some kind of philosophical position about "fairness" you should never accept any kind of payment or increase in wealth that cannot be matched to a specific kind of output or value-add you gave to the economy.
In fact, right now, Coinbase deserves profit much much more than you do, because they are actually doing the work of exchanging fiat for Bitcoin. All you did was give them some fiat and sit on your butt.
Which is also what I am doing, and it's great. But let's not try to say their profit is "unfair". They're actually working!

But it can't all zero out. They have to make money because they have to pay their costs AND make a profit or the whole thing is a waste of time.

If Bitcoin does indeed go global (seems all but inevitable now, doesn't it?) and you hold at least 1.0BTC, that puts you in the top 0.3% of population... at least as far as size of Bitcoin position is concerned.
There will only be 21 million Bitcoin. Fewer than 21 million people will have 1.0BTC or more because of the whales. And the last million or so coins will take 100 years to mine.

Everyone thinks Marx is just about communism, but actually a lot of what he wrote earlier is super-relevant right now... or rather, the later thinkers who pointed out problems with his ideas are relevant. Which, if they are thinking about him, that makes him relevant by association... or something.
One of the big criticism of Marx is that while he understood technology's role in disrupting the relationship between work and capital, he wrote as if technology (and science) just sort of turned up one day, like they came "from without".
But of course tech and science are also products of work, and the question had to be asked: if an owner of capital provides his workers with a bunch of steel, then they work on it and turn it into cars, and then those cars are sold at a profit which goes back to the owner thus increasing his capital...
...what exactly was it that made the steel turn into more capital? It's still the same steel, the workers just bent it around a bit. Marx (and many others) talked about how the *work itself* created the profit, not the end product. 
And this idea that work is worth something, and you should be PAID for your work instead of just given a warm place to sleep and a castle to hide in when the Huns come, is absolutely key to our system of exchange of *energy* that lies underneath all our money and markets and fiat and barter and whatever. When you sell something, what are you really selling? Your work.
But what Marx didn't properly take into account (some say) is the work done elsewhere to come up with the design of the car. Well, that's not quite right - he understood there were designers and draughtsmen etc doing work in the other room, but he'd talk about how their work was affected by *new technology*, how that would change their designs "from outside"  - new grades of steel, new types of piston linings, a new way of controlling the car. And he didn't really explain how that fits into the rest of the system, very well. 
Marx has the classes, right? The working class and all that. But recently, various philosophers (McKenzie Wark for instance), talked about another class that doesn't make product, they make "forms". 
Satoshi is a perfect example - while his specific design of BTC can be seen as a design product, the whole idea of this kind of design is a "form" he (building on the "forms" of others) came up with. Wark called them "the hacker class" and I think we're still trying to come up with a slightly less lame-sounding name...

It's pretty straightforward.
Ponzi schemes rely on getting lots of people to join before too many of the earliest members demand their payout.
Once too many members start demanding their money, the scheme collapses (or the instigator runs off with the cash).
The earliest adopters of Bitcoin (who managed not to lose their coins, sell them at previous ATHs or get them stolen) have seen their initial investment grow the most.
100BTC today is worth over $500,000. Once, it was worth just $10. And before that it was worth cents, and originally NOTHING.
The fear is that these early "whales" could suddenly all cash out, converting their cheap BTC into hundreds of millions of dollars in fiat, crashing all the exchanges and panicking everyone else into selling.
Whoever got in earliest and then got OUT earliest would make the most money in that situation.
However, this isn't going to happen. Because Ponzi schemes are based on bullshit, they don't do anything. Bitcoin has an actual use, people want it.

Private insurance is more expensive than single-payer healthcare. You are literally paying more out of your own pocket just so you can be sure "poor people" don't accidentally get something "for free". It's a weird quirk of human psychology.
Apparently there's this experiment that goes something like "if you join this queue, I will give you $1000, but I will give the person ahead of you in the queue $5000." Most people apparently say "Hell naw that's no fair!" and voluntarily give up $1000 just to be sure the other guy doesn't get $5000.
When it comes to welfare it's like "if you chop this wood, we will give you $100, but we will also give that poor kid $2." And you say "this is crap that poor kid didn't do anything, I did all the work!"
If you believe poor people get more money than you for doing nothing, then you're simply delusional.

For gold in the ocean? 
Pretty common knowledge. High quality marine aquarium synthetic sea salt even has gold in it (or so the manufacturers claim). 
As you can see from NOAA's quick intro, it's 20 million tons dissolved in the water and distributed, I assume, more or less evenly. Extracting it right now is totally impractical, but with nanotech, who knows?
However, I didn't realise - and it seems obvious now - the bottom of the sea, geologically speaking, should have more or less similar distribution of precious metals than the land. It's all just crust, right? There's potentially MASSIVE amounts of resources and it makes sense because it's 70% of the surface of the crust!!!

Yeah good fucking luck. You are talking about ordinary people, they don't have the time or inclination to learn the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. My wife is a geographical information systems remote sensing scientist who programs supercomputers to analyse multi-terabyte imagery databases... and she was reading the paper today and said "So is Ethereum like the software that Bitcoin runs on, or the operating system or something?"
You say "Bitcoin cash" to Joe Public and he will say "Oh is that those gold coins they make with the B on it? Like the dollar sign but with a B?"
To be honest I'd be surprised if even 10% of the analysts out there understood the difference, or indeed realised that Bitcoin Cash existed at all. They probably don't even know that Litecoin exists.
Some JUST ABOUT know Ethereum exists because of the whole "smart contracts" thing and the juicy DAO exploit. 
As far as I'm concerned, the whole Bitcoin Cash episode is a lesson learned in rushing things. Everyone was so fucking anxious to get the problems "fixed" no one thought about the timing. (Or maybe they did and just didn't get listened to, I didn't follow the pre-fork debate.)
At the very least calling it Bitcoin Cash was dumb and basically ensures it will be obscured by what the public thinks is "real" Bitcoin. Mark my words - FOX will tell mom and pop investors that Bitcoin Cash is "wannabe copycat" Bitcoin at some point. Idiots.

No, "money" will not be replaced, because "money" is a fundamental concept like "trade" and "debt". 
In fact I doubt even fiat will be replaced any time soon. Because if Bitcoin does become the new gold, we'll probably end up with money systems "backed by Bitcoin" where polities issue fiat currency pegged to Bitcoin (ie a central bank has to hold a certain amount of BTC for every Phenobian Wooden Shekel it issues).
And then a few generations on from then they will get annoyed with having everything pegged to Bitcoin and will "float" their fiat again and the circle of life continues...

I think you shouldn't call it "$20" I think you should tell him you bought some number of mBTC. 
At $5600 even, $20 is 0.003 BTC or 3 mBTC. If you can stretch to 5 mBTC (0.005 BTC) then who knows, if everything goes well that could be worth a few grand one day!
Also, if you call the present "5 mBTC" or "5 bits" or "5 em-bits" (we haven't got consensus on the name yet!) it will help teach him that Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million units.
In fact, if you wanted to seem super-cool and generous, call it "50,000 satoshis" because that's the smallest unit the system can currently recognise.

Any currency that makes use of the benefits of having no intrinsic value, can also be (functionally) infinite. I think that's probably a near-inevitable trade off. BTC is a good solution, because it has an INTENDED finite quantity. 
So sure, it's possible to have infinite crypto, but people KNOW each BTC is only supposed to be one of 21 million (bit less in reality) so there will always be a debate.
Compare that to something with intrinsic value, like oil. We could find a gigantic million billion barrel reservoir tomorrow, and no one will say "that oil is invalid". As for asteroids... now THAT'S a hammer that will fall one day. Disruption? We ain't seen nothing yet (Note to asteroid miners: please do not literally make the asteroid a hammer that will fall on us).
And as for gold. Anyone going super long on gold, like decades long, better hope to Christ that not only do we not find an asteroid full of the stuff, they also have to hope advances in nanotech or whatever don't make it economically viable to extract gold from seawater.

I'd argue strongly that this conclusion, while not necessarily *wrong*, has been interpreted incorrectly. 
As we know, the Kardashians etc - as the ur-influencers upon whom all other influencers essentially model their behaviours - are not beloved of the upper middle class or of hipsters or of adventurers, or etc. They are beloved of "reg'lar folk" who wish they too could afford the fabulous lifestyles...
It's not about accumulating money, it's about affording the lifestyle. When Kimmy from high school manages to become an "influencer", nobody cares about her actual opinions. They are just impressed she gets heaps of consumer products for free.
I am not sure if the current crop of philosophers who are considering how the internet etc affects traditional understandings or work, consider "time" itself to be the ultimate carrier of value. 
After all, you can sit doing nothing, and that "spends time" with no measurable output. You can't "do work" and have no measurable output because that's the definition of work - doing something that causes a system to change, thus generating an output.
Honestly this just makes no sense at all to me.

As soon as you buy some Bitcoin from an exchange like Coinbase, and the purchase is confirmed, you are able to use it right away to buy stuff, you don't need to do anything else.
Bitcoin was originally intended to be for buying stuff online (according to the white paper) and that's certainly the easiest way to use it - sitting at your PC, going to a store, choosing something, then clicking buy.
If the shop accepts BTC, it will give you an address to send your payment to. Something like a0Vw233cb356Bd... etc. 
You would go back to Coinbase, login, go to your BTC Wallet, and "SEND" Bitcoin to the store's address.
Coinbase will tell you how much the transaction will costs (a bit less than a dollar to a few dollars, depending on when you are sending - it has to do with load on the network, basically), then you confirm via 2FA (you have that set up right?) and then bam, your Bitcoin is spent, and you will get the thing you bought sent to you.
Of course, if you are wanting to save your Bitcoin and wait for the price to go up a lot more, you can just leave it at Coinbase - but if Coinbase ever goes bust or gets hacked (the former is unlikely, the latter *almost certain*) your Bitcoin could disappear. Unlike a bank, which insures at least some portion of your account, any coins lost from an exchange are gone forever. (We can expect this to change as the years go on...)
As others have said, the best thing to do right now is to send your Bitcoin to an external wallet, one where you control the PRIVATE KEY. This is the most important part of the whole system - whoever holds the private key has the "right" to use/spend/transact the Bitcoin balance associated with it.
(All of these words - wallet, coin, key, even transact and send - are metaphors. The blockchain technology under Bitcoin isn't really *like* anything else ordinary people use day to day. For instance, what your private key really does is give you the ability to generate "unspent transaction output" at a nominated address on the Blockchain... and there's still more to it than that!)
When your coins are on an exchange like Coinbase, you control them via your account, not a private key. Coinbase still has the private key because really what you're doing each time you access your account is asking for permission to mess around with the little bit of Coinbase's stash that you've paid for access to.
As Bitcoin gets more valuable, we are going to come under sustained and increasingly sophisticated attack from every ne'erdowell on the intertubes. Your PC will be infected by keyloggers and spyware. Exchanges will be hacked, cracked, ddosed, crashed, spoofed, nuked, you name it. This is not a maybe. This will happen.
The *safest* way to store your coins *long term* is via a paper wallet. You generate an address on the blockchain, and a PRIVATE KEY, you print those out (there are neat paper wallet generators that create QR codes and such, but really all you need are the two strings of numbers/letters) and then you use Coinbase to send your coins to that address.
You need to then store the paper wallet in such a way that the PRIVATE KEY cannot be seen by anyone else, or damaged or made illegible in some way. 
The problem with a paper wallet is that you have to type the key into a PC one day to get the coins out of it. If you type the key once to send all the Bitcoin somewhere else and then throw the wallet away, that's fine, but if you are using the paper wallet over and over, and leaving coins on it, each time you type that key it increases the chance that some scumbag will record it somehow (there's like a dozen ways).
If you want to use Bitcoin regularly and buy as much of your day to day stuff with it as possible (admirable!) then a HARDWARE WALLET is a better bet.
This gives you some neat wallet software, lets you make different "accounts" to organise your coins, lets you store other coins like Ethereum or whatever, but most of all it lets you "sign" your private key to a transaction without having to type it in.
The hardware wallet's most important job is to send that private key from its internal electronics, through a USB cable, and out onto the blockchain without the possibility of a human reading what numbers and letters make up the key.
There's lots of cool cryptography stuff about why a reputable hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano is essentially uncrackable, so google around.
For an ordinary person though, who just doesn't want their BTC stolen, a hardware wallet both makes the organising of your BTC balance easier - via software that makes it look more like a normal bank account and less like a crazy cypherpunk coding crypto nightmare - and gives you peace of mind that while the hardware wallet isn't plugged in to anything, it's pretty much IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to steal your coins.
Hope that helps!

These superior fucks (not all of them, but too many of them on this subreddit) don't seem to realise they NEED people like you to commit to Bitcoin because there are WAY MORE OF YOU than there are of them (them being cypherpunk computer heads who understand WTF TCP/IP is etc).
If you are looking for a simple answer it's this: buy some Bitcoin and other coins now and wait.
Within I reckong 5 years but sure it might be a little longer, you bank will accept Bitcoin deposits in the same way it accepts cash right now. No fee, no bullshit. Then you get a credit card, and when you buy something like gas, packet of potato crisps, whatever, the beeper machine will say "do you want to pay in USD or BTC?" And you just tap what you want.
It WILL get easier and "invisible" but it's going to take a few years. If you buy in now, you WILL have more money in the long run. *Almost* definitely. not 100%, but almost.

Thanks dude! But I need to modify my answer...
Diamond actually has incredibly high intrinsic value, because it can be used industrially to improve other things and increase their value through work (cutting, drilling etc). It's just that diamond, being a form of carbon, should have a very low *cost* because it's so common.
But because De Beers and a few others control the market, the cost of flawed, dirty, mechanically useless diamond to consumers is kept artificially high.
I just had a quick google - apparently industrial diamond costs from $0.30 to $7 a carat and some highly specialised stuff is up to $200 a carat. Natural diamonds are $1400 a carat... for a particular, arbitrary, made-up "quality". 
Hilariously, the more randomly pretty the impurity in the diamond, the higher the cost per carat.

The risk on Bitcoin for anyone who bought in 2010 and sold today has turned out to be zero. That is a fact.
Just because you want to make your decision NOT to buy in 2010 make some kind of sense, you dismiss people who took big risks as "idiots".
If you DID buy in 2010 and are sitting on $10million, why the fuck do you still believe there was any risk betting on Bitcoin in 2010?

Counterpoint: you're not taking it too seriously enough. A significant portion of the people in this subreddit are buying bitcoin on the expectation of making crazy, once-in-a-generation superprofits, while at the same time complaining that an exchange that takes 4.5% instead of 3.8% is "ripping people off."
Then they say tax is theft.
They are motivated by self-interest, and trying to get a benefit from a system that relies on everybody participating. Yet on some level in their brains, the image they see is them bursting into a store in front of everyone and grabbing all the bargains FIRST FIRST FIRST.

it's true that if someone snuck into your house and copied down the "recovery sentence" they could "sweep" your wallet and get your coins. Some wallets use a 24 word sentence but I'm not super convinced that really adds much more protection. You still have to write that shit down.
However, the baddies need to know ALL the words, and they need to know the ORDER in which they go.
Maybe consider re-ordering the words according to some method only you know?
Maybe store the card/whatever with the words on it somewhere really fucking weird, like taped to the underside of the thing that holds your toilet brush?
I don't know much about Mycelium, but some wallets also allow you to add an additional layer with a passphrase. This is a word only you know and it's not encoded or backed up anywhere. If you forget the word, you wallet is gone, dead and the coins with it. It cannot be swept with the 12 word recovery sentence if you have a passphrase on it too. (so you have to think of a word you will never forget but which no one who knows you can ever guess would be a word you would use... good luck with that!)
Ultimately, grab a hardware wallet. These little things are next level. They have various design aspects that make them fundamentally uncrackable... have a read around about Trezor, Ledger, even KeepKey.
Some people will insist a paper wallet is safer than a hardware wallet. I can't agree because a paper wallet requires you to type your private key into a computer to transact. That puts you at risk of a key logger or some other kind of malware.
Hardware wallets are really just dongles that provide the private key to sign a transaction, without your computer ever rendering the characters that make up that key. No human can see a private key sent by a hardware wallet. That said, if you get one, sign up to the newsletter and keep abreast of any potential issues, glitches, vulnerabilities. These things cost less than $200 and if you don't like the way the development of one is going, just throw the fucker out and buy a different one. (Uh, take your coins off it first though, obv.)
Also, the pace of change in hardware is relentless. If you find yourself owning a hardware wallet that is, say, six months old, see if there are better ones now. A year old? Change it on principle. Don't put the future of your fortune in the hands of the international conglomerate that controls the USB standard...
As always, every single storage method is ultimately vulnerable to what is sometimes called the "$5 wrench attack" or the "rubber hose attack". That's when a bad dude grabs you and hits you with a $5 wrench or a rubber hose until you give him all your passwords and PIN and shit.
So if you buy a HW wallet, treat it like you were buying gold. Tell NO ONE you have it in the house. Tell NO ONE how much BTC you have. You have, I suspect, a few months of peace before the crack attempts, the identity theft attempts, the hacks and the spyware get truly out of control. 
There is a storm coming and you are right to want to protect your BTC. When 1.0BTC is worth six figures, crack heads are going to make the effort to learn how to steal that shit from the unprepared...

Everyone is so fucking *defensive* about this aspect of BTC, they interpret even MENTIONING the "million dollar pizza" as someone saying "don't spend BTC evaaaah!"
It is the history of BTC and it's the future of BTC and acknowledging it helps us make smarter decisions.
Spending 0.005 on a coffee might seem like a throwaway amount today, so you might not bother topping it up. But what if it ends up being worth $5000? Then it's totally worth topping up your stack with 0.005 BTC.
Same for those little $14 coinbase purchases. Same for Nicehash mining at "$3.07" a day.

Ah! You've struck precisely upon the problem. Today, you can still buy newly minted gold coins, but the "fiat value" on it will make almost no sense. 
In Australia, I can buy a 2017 gold sovereign for about AUD$750. But its fiat value is just $25! The US has Silver Eagle which is 99% pure silver but with a face value of just $1.
The point of these coins is that they are for collectors and are called Non Circulating Legal Tender. The face values - the fiat values - are set by governments, by Act or whatever, and they are the ultimate exmaple of fiat, because they are so out of sync with the intrinsic value of the metal in the coin.
In fact, the government itself acknowledges this: if you get four Silver Eagles in payment for something, you can't say your income was $4, you have to declare it based on the weight-value of silver.
Anyway, the circulating gold coin I most recently read up on is the British Guinea. This was the gold coin before the sovereign, and it had a fiat value of 21 shillings. But I think it was the 18th century, the British suffered a bit of a gold shortage, and people were trading Guineas for 27 shillings a piece. 
This tends to mess things up, which is why today all our coins are made of zinc and nickel and copper with little dabs of precious metals if we're lucky.
The British solved their problem, again by fiat, and made a new coin - the sovereign - which contained less than 20 shillings worth of gold, but was still legal tender for 20 shillings. (I dunno why they ditched the extra shilling).
Money works better and more reliably *as money* if whatever it is made of has an intrinsic value much, much lower than its fiat value. Coins made of base metals good. Notes made out of plastic, even better.

^1 The Blockchain we made 300 qubits by 50 qubits by 40 qubits, ^2 and when we built it, we went into the world and gathered every kind of coin, by twos, and put them into the Blockchain. 
^3 And of the clean altcoins, the sacred blockchains of Ethereum and Litecoin and Monero, yea even Bitcoin, gathered we seven of each. 
^4 Yea and verily, unto the final altcoin, the Unspeakable we offered no place, for its form was familiar yet corrupt. 
^5 Yet neither did we neglect the smallest - see how we made a place also for IOTA.
^6 After we gathered all these good things, then did we shut up the Blockchain and take it mightily Offline. 
^7 Then came a great Cataclysm and there were 40 days of highs and 40 days of lows, ^8 and verily many triangles were inverted, and many candles towered red long into the night. 
^9 On the 41st  day did we sacrifice a mighty Bull. ^10 And the Great God Crypto saw it was good. And He was pleased.
^11 On the 42nd day did we sacrifice a noble Bear. ^12 And the Great God Crypto was well pleased with this offering also.
^13 On the 43rd day it was a bank holiday and we couldn't do shit. Fucking banks.
^14 On the 44th day released we a single Monero from the Blockchain, yet it did not return and we knew it to be lost.
^15 On the 45th day released we a newborn Bitcoin, and at nightfall it did return carrying within its beak a fresh, green Nonce.
^16 And there was much rejoicing, for the time of the Blockchain had come at last.

Sorry how will hodling get you pennies once the price goes back up?
If you have 2.3BTC today, you will have 2.3BTC tomorrow.
Your technique is good - it lets you buy more Bitcoin. 
But the price of Bitcoin TODAY doesn't matter IF you believe it will be worth $100K+ in the future. 
Let's say you sold 2BTC at $4300, making $8600.
Then you spend all of that at $2500, making 3.44BTC.
You got an extra 1.44BTC, great! But if Bitcoin then crashed out and dies, you're in no better position than anyone else. 
If Bitcoin goes to the moon and we get that amaaaazing million dollar coin (snort) then you have $3.44m and we only have $2.0m. Oh noes! And your BTC  bet made you $400 per dollar invested!
Now, we could have bought our 2.0BTC at $5000, so we spent $10,000 and only made $200 per dollar invested, damn. 
But for all you know, we bought our 2.0BTC at $500. Which means we made $20,000 per dollar invested! Woooo!
What if BTC never gets above $10,000? Then you've made $4 per dollar, and we've made $2 per dollar.
You know what? I can live with that.

I mean, if someone was smart enough to intercept your parcel, crack it open, get into the Trezor, flash it with a malicious firmware (which they say isn't possible but hmnn)...
...why the hell would they let it get to you looking obviously broken into?
As YOU know but others may not: Trezor is packaged in a sort of plastic rubbery surround a bit like a plastic model's sprue.
The "flap" of the box is actually glued shut and the tamper-proof sticker put over the top. By gluing the flap, it makes the ends of the box quite a bit stronger than the middle.
I can easily imagine if the box got crunched, it would split where it seems to have split on yours.
Again though, yeah do what it says to do and contact Trezor.
These hardware wallets are almost impossible for "casual" thieves to do anything with. 
ETA: It is possible but unlikely that your Trezor has been replaced with an "evil maid" - a fake one that looks exactly like the real one and when you send coins to it, they will just go to some gangster instead. This is where contacting Trezor will help - they will have a way of ensuring it's a real device.
Bottom line: it only cost a hundred bucks or so. If you are hodling significant amounts or plan to, throwing this away and getting another one is totally worth it.

"entitled" does not mean "annoyed when, after finally saving up (or investing well) to be able to afford a $200,000+ car, you find that the stalks behind the wheel are the same as the ones in your shitbox."
But fine. I retract it all. It's far better to invest in Bitcoin, HODL until your position grows, then immediately give a massive chunk of it to Volkswagen. 
That's the one attitude in this place that I REALLY don't understand: "Ew! Don't criticise Lamborghini! Don't say it's a bad purchase! I can spend my money on what I want!"

What a strange reading. The context of this discussion is "should you always hodl". OP said he had to sell 0.05 BTC to pay for dental work, and he doesn't regret that.
Then tells a short anecdote confirming that he knows dental work is expensive, so in the situation of needing to come up with money, OP using some of his BTC is convenient, even though spending BTC is against the philosophy of hodl.
The old dude's dental bill isn't part of the BTC aspect. He's just there as evidence dental work is expensive.

Bitcoin is inflating at 4%-ish right now in-and-of-itself but the overall effect on its purchasing power is massively deflationary. 
Consider that your 1.0BTC is buying more and more year on year.
And just so y'all know - massive deflation of your fiat currency right now would be fucking catastrophic, especially if you are holding debt.
Consider: it's cool that your $1 would be worth $10, since you could get a whole meal for $2. But your $200,000 mortgage is now the equivalent of $2,000,000....
I sure hope nobody took a LOAN in Bitcoin any time before August. As in, someone leant them 1.0BTC (for some reason, I can't really imagine why they would do that, but still.) in Jan.
To "pay back" that loan with, say 1.1BTC (interest, y'all), would have cost $2200 just WEEKS ago. Now it will cost nearly $4180.
Harsh economic truths: a small amount of very smooth, gradual inflation is much, much better than deflation. 
Hell, without inflation in-and-of-itself right now, Bitcoin wouldn't even work at all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:38:52
Sigh. If you believe Bitcoin is the future of money, then your "capital" is how much Bitcoin you hold, right? 
If you bought Bitcoin at $4000 and its destiny is to be worth $100,000 one day, then the rises and dips in fiat value between today and that wonderful, magical day don't matter.
UNLESS you want to increase the amount of Bitcoin you hold.
Selling out now and running away never to return is probably not an economically optimal move.

Interested to you know your experience of setting up to receive Bitcoin as a merchant. Just a matter of installing some plugins to your site?
Have you ever had someone cheat you of payment somehow? (I suspect the answer is no!)
Has any customer accused you of "stealing their coins" or have there been any misunderstandings around how transaction fees work, how transaction confirmations work, all that?
I could imagine some poor merchant being inundated with emails:
"OMG my coins are gone from my wallet but your site says payment pending and when I click on the transaction it says unconfirmed OMG OMG my coins OMG... pls respond... pls reponse... oh wait, tx confirmed nvm."

Oh shit you got me on a logical semantics argument. Well DONE!
Yes there is a difference between the *lottery* and the Superbowl. The difference is that nobody participating in the lottery can be certain that anyone will win the prize. In the Superbowl, all the people who bet on the winning team WILL DEFINITELY win a "prize". (I know there are things you can bet on like score-splits and whatnot that may not occur during the game, but seriously that is people adding more uncertainty to a system in hope of increasing their winnings - whatever!)
Again though, the outcome of the Superbowl is not random. One team is going to win (or there will be a draw I guess - does that happen though?). There are a lot of variables that makes it hard to correctly guess which team wins, but it's not random. Someone WILL win.
You are not "an idiot" for betting ion the Superbowl, it's a perfectly straightforward form of gambling that you can increase your chances of winning through research on the teams etc.
I am in no way arguing that this guy with the Bitcoin loan didn't take a RISK, a really big RISK on Bitcoin. But he's not an idiot. He made an informed choice and he was correct.
There's another difference between Bitcoin and the Superbowl though. NOBODY WHO BET ON BITCOIN LOST. Nobody. If the choice is "don't bet, or bet and definitely win" then that is very different to sports.

Perhaps I shall make some plastic money. I have heard of this, and I know American children play with plastic money in their dollhouses and pretend shops - and after all I am also making a plastic cash register. This will be a good product to support my other product."
"And there is a lot of criticism right now that plastic toys are not good, and we must restore faith in the Made in China brand. I attended a trade show last week where they said making EDUCATIONAL toys was the future."
"So I shall brand my plastic money as suitable for education, and I will include it in the next shipment because the deal I have with the distributor in America is to sell plastic toys by the tonne, not by the specific kind of toy."

It's a fascinating feature of this community. Everyone is here buying BTC and telling everyone to be careful about buying BTC, while constantly anticipating a crash, while saying "never sell." I've never seen anything like it and it's awesome.
Markets get fucked over when people panic. This community is constantly inoculating itself against panic: "Don't invest too much, expect a crash, don't panic when it crashes." That's incredibly solid advice.
Because of concepts like hardware and paper wallets, we can be incredibly well-shielded against panicky flash-crashes. Our version of a run on the bank - the mempool clogging up with panicking transactions - gives us the opportunity to sit back, relax, and let our common sense prevail.
This is the first time I've invested in something where I actually WANT there to be a big correction so I can see how people react to it. Anyone with their coins accessed via a hardware wallet is sitting pretty.
Also, you may be correct about an upward correction. I think "going broke from BTC" means buying in the day after it jumps $10K to $15K, then going under when it "corrects" to $12K.

This is also how I rebuy. I also usually only spend BTC on $100+ purchases, at vendors who give a decent discount for using BTC.

This drives me nuts. The whole point of money is that it has NO intrinsic value so people don't melt it down.
Historically, time and time again gold coins had to be revaluated or abandoned because the gold in them ended up being worth more than the coin.

Haha. Apparently, since all the tulip bullshit was about contracts and promises-to-buy, when the actual tulip bulbs arrived and auctioneers said "come on boys, come and get those tulips you ordered!" everyone said "Um, no thanks, there's way too much bubonic plague where you guys are."
The tulip bubble was made possible by a law that said if you signed a contract to buy tulips for, say, $1000-dutch-bux-equivalent, you could get out of the contract by paying just 3.5% - a governmental decree (or fiat, you might say) basically turned "futures contracts" into "options contracts" overnight.
So everyone was free to run around town shrieking that a single tulip was "worth" more than a merchant's yearly income, but nobody actually ever PAID that money to anyone.
So Mackay's *Madness of Crowds* was a useful fable about the follies of speculation, but actual research into tulipmania has shown it was just a fable.
Apparently, diligent researchers can only find SIX notable people who were badly affected by tulips, and the whole thing was little more than a crazy pub game played by giggling, half-drunk merchants while tavern owners pocketed 2.5% of every trade.

Gold's performance as an electrical conductor is entirely irrelevant to its role as a store of wealth...
...actually that's not quite right. The delusion that gold is somehow better as a store of wealth than any other similarly rare, shiny, non-corroding metal actually LIMITS our ability to take advantage of gold's useful properties.
There are lots of things where gold would be a better fit but we don't use it because it's too expensive.
Gold also depends entirely on science being right about its rarity. All it takes is the discovery of one giant deposit of the stuff, or the development of a technology to *cheaply* extract the TWENTY MILLION TONNES of gold in the ocean, and gold is done.

I think it's appropriate to want BTC to justify us giving up thousands of dollars of our hard earned fiat to put it into the system, so the system grows.

**Don't Invest More Than You Can Lose** is chiseled on the lintel of the doorway to this sub. 
Nobody here says spend 80% of what you're worth on Bitcoin, and any time someone posts "woo I just mortgaged my grandmother for BTC!" the response is ALWAYS "dude... balls... but you're an idiot."
What's annoying YOU about this sub is that everyone's not screaming "SELL SELL SELL!" and not everyone is a daytrader, and not everyone thinks the risk of mistiming the dip and losing not just money but BITCOINS by not having enough fiat to  buy back in again, is worth it.
The point with Bitcoin is that a dip doesn't lose ANY of your "capital"... if you consider your BTC to be capital. So people are just curious to see who else thinks like that.
Obviously you are in the school of thought that says Bitcoin will never be a reserve, or act like a reserve, or if it does it will take so long it's no worth waiting for.
Most people here don't believe that. Most of us aren't expecting Bitcoin to give us INCOME all year. So we just want to buy as much as we can and wait.
Crystal ball gazing but, I am very certain that anyone who leaves now and messes up buying back in and so ends up, by the end of the year, with less BTC than they wanted, will strongly regret it.

Sorry - WHY is gold worth what it is worth? Why is it worth $1333 an oz or whatever it is today? Why not $5000, or $500? 
Gold's qualification for being a benchmark of wealth is "it's been used for longer". That's all. There's nothing fundamental about gold except it's pretty and rare. It's actually worse to use for almost anything you need metal for - swords, pots, axes etc. You need super-high technology - electronics, spacecraft - before you really need gold.
Even when we make jewellery out of it, we need to mix it with other metals because pure gold is too soft.
You seem to be mixing up "intrinsic value" (the financial term meaning the combined net value of an assets ability to create future cash flows, rather than its current market value) and "intrinsic value of wealth" which looks at how much it costs to produce the item.
Gold's intrinsic value of wealth is whatever it costs to mine, and so this too is Bitcoin's intrinsic value. Gold was put here randomly by debris from a long-ago supernova coalescing into the Earth (current theory), but that's not fundamentally different to someone designing a computer program that doles out Bitcoins according to a formula.
It's a thing that can be seen as separate from other things, it is rare, and you can hold it in discrete lumps. 
Why do we use Gold and not, say, iron or steel? Because Gold is rare and takes more work to find and extract. So it's like Bitcoin in that it's the "proof of work" (ie, the bar of gold sitting all shiny on the table in front of you) that makes gold valuable.
If gold was the second most common metal in the world, and the entire ground was made of gold if you just dig two feet down, gold wouldn't be work shit, no matter how pretty it is. Not because it's too COMMON, but because it's too easy to get.

The absolute safest thing to do during the fork and for at least a few days afterwards is not use the Bitcoin network in any way.
Secure your coins in a wallet where you control the keys, and then wait and see.
Reply attacks occur when you transact. If you don't transact, and you continue to keep your private key(s) safe and secure, it's all cool.

You will have time. Have some BTC on an exchange and be at your PC or whatever on Sept 30 if you are serious about benefitting from it. Remember it doesn't matter if you "miss" the ATH, you will have many minutes to change out your coins.
The biggest risk then will be a sudden reversal like what happened when it hit $3000. Even then you will have some time to buy back in and still end up with a bunch more BTC.

I think what's important to remember is that the "size" of the blockchain only really matters to people running full nodes or mining. For us users, unless we want to run a full-sync wallet, it doesn't really matter.
I do think that, if this experiment is a success, future always-on personal computational devices (ie smartphones or whatever comes next) will ultimately run nodes all the time in the background. With 5G mobile data networks and handsets more powerful than a top-end PC from 2016, you won't even notice it.

Has ANY Aussie paid tax...
What? You want me to be more specific? Okay.
Has ANY Aussie paid tax on Bitcoin do you think? :)
For Americans and other aliens reading this: It's not that Aussies don't believe in tax. It's just that one of our richest tycoons of the 20th century, Kerry Packer, once said "anyone in this country" who did not minimise their tax "wants his head read." He said this, to our Senate. In a hearing. On the record. While talking about rich people not paying their share of tax.
He took a $40 million tax bill to the Federal Court and had it reduced to zero. Justices were like "says right here he can do that... and this... and this... and a little off for that..."
We should be thankful WE didn't end up owing HIM money.
(Packer is also famous for a gambling story, of which there are many different versions. This one is from former politician Kim Beazley: "“He was gambling in Las Vegas and there was a Texas cattleman who grew quite resentful of the favoured treatment that Kerry was getting. Eventually this cattleman approached him and said, ‘Do you know I’m worth $US70 million?’ And Kerry looked at him and replied ‘I’ll toss you for it.”)
Packer would probably have described Bitcoin as "petty bulldust."

On this subreddit "the moon" means a massive final value for 1.0BTC, high enough that the world will probably price it in mBTC, not whole Bitcoins.
If you don't believe that outcome is possible, what are you even doing here? What's the point of owning Bitcoin right now if they don't increase hugely in value? Are you converting some portion of your fiat each pay for spending purposes?
The point here is that for some people the "reward" of messing around selling out and buying back in and pay all those fees over and over isn't worth the risk.
All you bear sellers talk as if you sell once at the ATH, and then buy back in precisely at the bottom of the trough (or at least near it). But you don't. You're not like that at all. You sell and buy and sell and buy over and over and your position gets nibbled away by fees.
Again, you probably end up richer when you finally use your money to buy stuff, but some of us don't want that stress! We bought our 2BTC because we believe that will be worth $200,000 one day, and whether it cost us $400 or $4000 or $10,000 to get that $200,000 just doesn't matter that much.


WTF does this mean? Whenever you stop buying BTC, the BTC you hold will have cost you a specific amount. $8600 is $8600 whether you spent it all at once, or if you bought in bits and pieces that add up to $8600. I just didn't put in a realistic total spend - probably more like $8578.37 - because the arithmetic was too hard.

Have you read the Moat Around Murcheson's Eye? The sequel written some years later, where they switch the subtextual racism from the Chinese to the Arab world (ooooh, I went there).
Has one of the best running space battles in Sci Fi. Horace Bury is now the main character, and his ship Sinbad goes back into the Mote to negotiate, with the a cruiser called Atropos as escort. Awesome imagery of Sinbad docking with a Motie asteroid colony while the Atropos holds station, a featureless black egg under its Langston field. 
And when they (inevitably) have to flee, Kevin Renner (Bury's pilot) is like "Atropos can you give us cover?" And Atropos is all, shrug, yeah whatever. And they start blasting tiny Motie ships in every direction because they're so huge they're basically untouchable.
Then they all pop through the Alderson point and the Motie fleet follows right into the guns of an even bigger destroyer called Agamemnon. It's just a solid 150 pages of ass-kicking space fight that feels halfway realistic. (It's basically like battles in The Expanse - Sinbad even has a secret railgun.)

HARSH ECONOMICS
If you spent 1.0BTC on snacks in the past, you absolutely 100% suffered an opportunity cost to later hold the same purchasing power as US$3770. That you couldn't have known this doesn't matter. It is fact.
We can't just "refuse to recognise" that BTC's value rises very quickly against fiat. We need to acknowledge this, and ESPECIALLY now, we need to tell people to keep buying shit with Bitcoin and just topping up their BTC afterwards.
Telling someone today to spend ALL their Bitcoin on coffee "because the system needs you to spend it" is not ethical. 
Why? *Because the hypocritical fucks who say that kind of shit are hodling*. They say "oh I have some BTC in cold storage and a smaller amount I use every day" or something.
Big fucking deal. We are paying money for a thing that might evaporate a few years from now (please God no) because we hope our early investment - our early faith - will be rewarded with gains.
There is nothing wrong with that. Unless you want a government to one day suddenly DECLARE Bitcoin the new money, or you are prepared to wait decades for it to slowly rise in value like normal inflation, through billions of coffee purchases...
...stop it with this "eeew, never say that Bitcoin will be worth more later!" crap.
Or you know, do what you want. That's the whole point of crypto. No declared realities. We just fight, until a dominant reality prevails...

Why the fuck would you write something so condescending? Have you never made a typo? It's fucking obvious from the context of what I'm talking about that it's a typo. Does anyone outside of a university have a 5Gbit connection? "You can pretty much guarantee..." Jesus Christ no wonder people hate their ISPs.
I mean, I'm not assuming you work in support in any way, but you're displaying the absolute TYPICAL attitude of the "tech support CSR". When a customer reports a problem, the  focus is always: "No, you've made an error in what you are saying, there is no problem."
Followed by: "Why would what you are saying cause a problem?"
Are you, someone who works for an ISP, seriously asking why it would be a problem if my 5Mb/s ADSL connection suddenly gets its entire upstream bandwidth filled by Dropbox upload?
You know, of course you do, that if you max-out the upstream it makes the connection unusable because requests to fetch packets down can't get through (or have latency measured in seconds) because of the upload?
In fact, I'm not sure you even understood what I was saying. The context here: if running a full node only takes, say, 2Mb/s down that might be fine, but if it takes much more than 500Kb/s up, that will make the average Aussie shitty home ADSL crap connection unusable.
Again: I find it hilarious that, on my not especially good 5 megaBIT (well, the line syncs at 7100 but I can never get speedtest.net to report more than about 5.4, so I guess the "real" speed is somewhere between 5 and 6, yeah?) , I find it hilarious that YouTube, Netflix etc have systems smart enough to deliver my kids TWO "HD" (compressed as all hell but whatever) video streams at once, yet just ONE machine uploading "as fast as it can" will render the WHOLE connection unusable.
Now, PLEASE tell me how I am wrong.

No it isn't and you are wrong in this case. Bitcoin is not gambling. 
The REALITY is that anyone who did not buy a lot of Bitcoin in 2010 made the wrong decision. EVERY SINGLE PERSON who bought a lot of Bitcoin in 2010 is now very rich.  Everyone who bought a lot of Bitcoin in 2014 got a significant return on their investment.
This is not like we all went up to a dealer and all got a separate hand dealt to us. There is no random outcome in this process. Everyone who bought 100BTC in March 2014 for $450 per coin, and did not sell, now has 100BTC worth something close to $50,000. All of them.
I understand this is how we deal with not making the right choice back in 2014, or 2013, or most of all 2010. We say "Oh well anyone who bet on Bitcoin when the outcome wasn't certain was an idiot." Except they weren't . They weren't choosing six random numbers and hoping the numbers got drawn. They looked at the situation and decided it was going to be big, and they backed their belief with cash. 
And it paid off. For all of them. This is the crucial difference - nobody who bought 100BTC in 2014 and still has 100BTC has lost money on Bitcoin. Not. A. Single. One.

Oh yes, mea culpa I did indeed read your previous post wrong - I read it as an either/or not a while/then.
I suspect I made this mistake because the comment is out of scope. You're pointing out that right now we should save Bitcoin and hold our debt in our inflationary fiat, right? To which I of course 100% agree.
I'm talking about an economy experiencing strong deflation.  
Even so, the statement "strong deflation is only good if you already have money" is still true - even in the case of Bitcoin. 
So I still want to know where the "nope" is...

As much as you can afford to lose :). 
No seriously, it COULD all get wrecked bu some bullshit we haven't thought of yet, but it probably won't.
So more accurately, invest as much as you can do without for the next I'd recommend 10 years.
The advantage/problem with Bitcoin is that unlike shares, you can withdraw little bits and pieces every now and then. It will be VERY tempting over the next few years to draw down to buy a car... maybe even a house...
But every fraction of a Bitcoin you withdraw will no longer be growing. Fiat money - if not invested - loses value just sitting around.
This will take a lot of self control, but it's a once in a generation opportunity to change your situation in a significant way. Maybe enough to set up future generations. (Though you know your grandkids will lose it all - that's how it goes.)

Why would you read my comment as saying "don't give your opinion"?
For some reason there's a species of redditor who comes in here every time the price of BTC drops to see if people are crying bitter tears, and if they find us going "woo cheap coins!" they feel compelled to say "HA! Fools! You're going to lose all your money!"
But look. Real talk. We can't predict the future for certain, but you know people who hold a decent amount of BTC today are going to have much more purchasing power than almost anyone else 10-15 years from now, right?

I also reckon Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth is underrated. Dance magic pants and all that, but really that character should have been overdramatic, scenery-chewing rubbish.
Yet Bowie made this evil, baby-stealing, chicken-kicking goblin *sympathetic* and *romantic* and made lots of a very certain kind of 12-14 year old girl (and maybe a few boys) all magic in their own pants...
The look on his face when Sarah finally remembers the line "you have no power over me." Any other actor would have been "Zounds! Curse you child!" but Bowie just gives her this "aw no, girl..." look, like an *equal*, like someone breaking up with someone but at the same time they know a) it is for the best and b) they were the one who fucked up.

I've often thought about this since there's another "I flushed my Bitcoins down the toilet in 2011" social media post every day...
Let's take 10,000BTC for instance, which at the time BitcoinMarket.com opened, cost $30. Today it's $41.9 million (as I write this).
But the question is, what kind of insane irrationally optimistic person would you have to be to not sell at:
- $1 (Feb 2011) - $10K
- $31 (July 2011) - $310K
- $266 (April 2013) - $2.66 million. Seriously, $30 has become $2.66 million, there is no human alive who wouldn't sell now, is there? Seriously?
-  $100 (June 2013 as it feel) - $1 million
- $200 (early November 2013) - $2 million
- $1242 (end of Nov 2013) - $12.4 million COME ON!
- $600 (December 2013) - $6 million, come on it's crashing!
- $1000 (December 2013) - $10 million, price is all over the place dude are you insane! Sell! Sell!
- $550 (February 2014) - $5.5 million, Mt Gox wiped out all those people man, you could be next!
- $200 (March 2015) - $2 million. The dream is over! Oh God please sell so you can at least be a millionaire! Aaagh!
- $1290 (March 2017) - $12.9 million. Okay, well played crazy person, it's back to that 2013 high you missed, so PLEASE sell NOW you know it's gonna crash!
- $2000 (May 2017) - $20 million. We can't be friends anymore I'm sorry, the stress, you know how it is.
- $3800 (August 2017) - $38 million. So. Despite all evidence to the contrary you held. Fine, I was wrong. Well done.
- $5000 (September 2017) - $50 million. Wow! To the moon! The price will never fall again! Woohoo!

In the context of this conversation. that was NOT my goal. My goal was to explain to my father - an old-school economist, with a degree in economics, a person who DOES understand how the "fiat" system works - the technical underpinnings of Bitcoin.
Incidentally, the way this community talks about "fiat" is not especially sophisticated. Here's a fun part of the conversation (as best I remember it):
ME: They classify the existing currencies, US dollars and pounds and that, as "fiat" currency.
DAD: What? Fiat?
ME: Yes, fiat.
DAD: Oh right, as in... yes of course, I get it. Ha. King Edward says a pound is worth this much in silver. Of course currency hasn't been issued by fiat for a long time.
ME: Huh?
DAD: Well, the Australian dollar was floated in the 90s by Keating so its value is set by the market.
ME: [a little lamely] Yeah but it follows directly on from the older currency that was declared by fiat, yeah?
DAD: I suppose.
(Note we are Australian. I agree the US dollar is much more "government man sez dollars is worth THIS much now" than the Aussie dollar. Our Reserve Bank is, for a Reserve Bank, pretty good. They didn't cut interest rates to the bone, and the loudest currency "scandal" in the country right now is whether or not the new $10 note looks nice and works properly in older vending machines as if anyone gives a single shit.)

I'm concerned that the belief in this sub that "inflation always bad, deflation always good" borders on the cult-like. You have a more sophisticated understanding of it, but most people just think "deflationary currency, yay!"
Regardless of what the government has or hasn't done historically, a deflation crisis any time soon would be very, very bad. It causes people to hoard money and it's extremely bad for debtors, and you know who relies very heavily on debt to function? *Farmers.*
As much as it's fun to point at government and say "ha ha you print fake money", if we simply sit back and let 60% of the population starve while we play with our Bitcoin, we'll be no better than the people who got us into this situation in the first place.

5000 is the largest number whose name (in English) has no repeated letters: F I V E T H O U S A N D.
So it *is* special, see :)
5040 now, that IS a special number.
5040 = 7! = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 10 * 9 * 8 * 7.

 Hey OP, sucks that you are (probably) being targeted but, thanks for posting a really fantastic example of a real world, practical reason BTC (well, crypto generally) is doing at least part of what Satoshi wanted it to do.
Because if this had been almost any other payment system, we'd be having a debate about whether it was photoshopped or not, and no one could know for sure if the payment had actually been made.
But with the blockchain, you can, as other have said, demand the tx ID and then go and look it up yourself. We can look it up. Everyone can look it up!

I have half-a-feeling that BTC will lead to an old school double-currency type situation like it was with gold and silver back (way back) in the day.
The silver coins and their various bits were the everyday spending cash, and the gold coins were the "real money" for buying serious shit like property and race horses.
For me the most insane example of this was the British Guinea which was their gold coin before the Sovereign. Was the guinea worth a pound? Like fruit it was - it was worth 21 shillings thank you very much, or 1.05 quid if it had been in decimal.
Shit got way out of control by the 19th century when a gold drought meant people were trading 21-shilling guineas for 27 shillings a piece, and the Brits were having to make special ones for their mercenary armies who would only accept payment in gold.
Even after it was replaced with the one-pound-even Sovereign, fancy peeps kept quoting in guineas:


Thanks Wikipedia! We also used it in Australia because we're totally fancy just like the Poms.
Incidentally, that "military guinea": used to have "Honi soit qui mal y pense" written on the back - sorry, the *reverse* oooh - which is kind of odd for a British coin, but whatevs. It translates to "May he be shamed who thinks badly of it."
Which would work quite well for Bitcoin actually...

Yes I know. OP is asking if, when you type in "$282" does Coinbase then add a fee on top, or subtract the fee from the number you type in.
They add the fee on top. So if I type "100" the fee is added in on top of that, so I still get $100 worth of BTC. (I'm set to Australian dollars so my fee is A$3.99).
The system displays a pending charge of $103.99, not $96.01.

No worries dude - using Bitcoin is actually really easy and so much faster than stuffing around with a bank.
But like computers were back in the day, the problem is, it's just not LIKE anything else, so it's hard to get your head around all the metaphors.
I mean, imagine bringing someone from 1950 to, say, 2000 and sitting them in front of a PC and saying "use the mouse to double-click the Internet explorer icon on the desktop."
[50s guy looks at actual desk] "Okay this gizmo with the tail is the mouse, yeah? But the... desktop?"
"No no, the screen, on the screen!"
[50s guy looks around for something made of fine mesh] "Screen?"
"Ugh! Fine, just press the Windows key on the keyboard!"
[50s guy looks around for piano] "Keyboard? Quit bugging me you drip, I'm sure a germ like you thinks this is all a big tickle, but if you start gettin' cranked you'll be cruisin' for a bruisin', dig? Flat out, tell me how to use this thing."
"Obviously you'll never get it, I don't know why I'm bothering."
[50g guy raises his middle finger] "Climb it, Tarzan."
Point is, once you learn what "wallet" and "transaction" and all that means in a Bitcoin/crypto context, you'll realise all you have to do is just type a couple of things and click a couple of things and that's it!
I think the most important thing is to really get your head around the fact that Bitcoin is CASH. It's like having a big pile of actual money sitting in your house. There's nothing on the money to tell anyone the money belongs to you - which is bad if someone steals it.
So you need to secure your bitcoin like you would secure cash if you had no access to (or didn't want to trust) a bank. Fortunately, because it's digital, it's a lot easier to do that properly! Especially compared to hiding a tin with $50,000 in it under your bed...

Okay let's break it down.
1. Income already taxed. Sure. But tax doesn't work like that. You don't get to say "Nah mate, I got taxed on the $1000 I used to invent my Levitating Flange so you can't tax me for the $4 billion I made licensing it to Ford." The $4 billion is NEW INCOME. And attracts tax.
2. Transaction on purchase taxed? I'm not sure what you mean? Do you mean the transaction fee? Or the exchange taking a cut? The exchange is a for-profit business. Why should it miss out on a profit so he can make a slightly bigger profit?
3. Conversion back to USD will be taxed. Again, the exchange incurred costs getting a hole of the USD it will use to pay the guy out, costs beyond the value of the Bitcoins he is selling. Again, they are entitled to make a profit.
4. Capital gains tax. Without it, systems like Bitcoin would allow people to simply evade tax. The country needs tax to operate. If you think the country - and country - can effectively operate with no tax then you are delusional.
Money circulates. If one dollar was slowly taxed away to nothing, sure that would be unfair. But one dollar, if circulated through the economy effectively, will grow to many thousands of dollars. It is fair that some of that be diverted to various things that ensure the person doing business can expect to still be doing business 10, 20, 30 years from now.

I don't think things will go "wrong" as such, but I am expecting the worst - a period where people freak out because their payment is showing as "unconfirmed", or a day when the network fee might be slightly higher due to load - the general buying public HATES sudden small price changes on stuff it has decided it shouldn't have to pay for.
I would bet if you went up to someone at a supermarket and said "I will give you a coupon for $150 of groceries, but if you need to pay a $10 bagging fee, and the bagging fee applies even if you bag your own stuff" they would freak out and say "NO WAY BAGGING FEE BULLSHIT I TAKE MY BIDNESS ELSEWHERE!"

The Great Correction, it will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. During the rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Correction came as a large and moving Torb! Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex Supplicants they chose a new form for it... that of a Giant Sloar! Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day I can tell you!

True and true.
My next target is a guy my age (40) who has a doctorate in economics, went to the LSE for a bit.
This guy's intellect blisters the paint on the walls, yet he was the one who mistook the DAO exploit for the "hacking" of Ethereum's actual blockchain.
I suspect my dad would have been much harder to convince when he was 40-50. I'm getting the most "talk to the hand" from guys my own age.
I think I get it. We are just coming into our own. We are the later members of Generation X, we're just starting to get CEO, COO type jobs or our companies are just starting to really make some money, we have not babies but young kids now, we're "man of the house" at home etc etc. Lords of All Creation, basically.
So you go to a 40 year-old crypto-doubter and he will say "No mate, I've got the world figured out now. This is bullshit like 3/4 of everything else."
I have one mate who is all computers, and no economics - he's not interested.
I have one mate who is no computers and all economics - he thinks Bitcoin is "a fraud" ???
And I have this mate (above) who is academic-level economics and a little bit of computers - he thinks crypto is interesting but unnecessary and also doesn't quite get how a badly scripted DAO doesn't mean Ethereum itself is unsecure.

It's the Mass Market. The "mom and pop" investors are rolling in and they all want to speak to the manager. They think a 40 minute tx confirmation is Coinbase "stealing their money." They think fluctuating network fees are "a scam". They the price of Bitcoin offered by Coinbase at any given moment is "wrong" or "a scam". They send BTC to an ETH address and then say it's Coinbase's fault. Etc etc...

I'm reading an account of the Mt Gox thing right now, some Kindle book that got shilled on here a month or so ago. I write, so I support Kindle losers :).
Anyway, it's pretty detailed except there's this really really weird bit where they spent like 500 words talking about how Mark Karpeles can ejaculate really far, and how he stained his expensive custom bed with cum... and I'm like... what the actual fuck?
They also keep saying things like "Maybe putting [Karpeles] in charge of the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange wasn't a great idea, but that's another story." And I'm like: No it isn't. It's THIS story. It's the entire point of your book!
And: "But back to Mt Gox for a minute..." I'm like, for a minute? Isn't this book about Mt Gox? What's on the rest of these pages, advertising?
Oh and: "They say there's no honour among thieves." No they don't. That is exactly what they DON'T say. There IS honour among thieves, that's the whole point, and that's what you then spend 2000 words describing about Silk Road.
But apart from that, good detail. What a cluster fuck.

True. This always happens. There are no examples of anything that has steadily increased in value over sufficiently long time periods. Not a single one. And Bitcoin is just like any stock, or just like trading fiat currencies against each other. Exactly the same. Nothing new here at all.

The fee is not related to the value of your transaction, it's related to the size (in bytes), and to what sort of priority you give it.
The blockchain has a finite amount of hashing power. A block must be completed to confirm your transaction and add it to the "history" of the blockchain.
When lots of people are sending transactions at once, it takes longer for them all to be confirmed.
You can choose to offer a higher fee to "jump the queue" and get your tx confirmed earlier, or you can choose no fee at all and wait... who knows. 
In the case of Coinbase, you are putting the responsibility of managing and securing Bitcoin in your account on them. They cannot work for free. Could their fees be too high? Possibly, but I thought everyone here was supposed to be anti-regulation and pro-free market? Coinbase charges what the market will bear. 
Did you consider they don't WANT you sending $1 transactions, putting load on the system just so you can "test" it? The fee, in this case, is a disincentive.
It's up to you to get educated on this and learn how the system works. Simply calling it a "ripoff" does nothing.

Satoshi Nakamoto?
Nah, seriously - you could mount an argument that whatever Satoshi's nationality actually was (almost 100% not Japanese though), Bitcoin only truly started in Japan.
Mt Gox was in Japan. Roger Ver lives in Japan. The Japanese were early adopters. There was a bunch of time where BTC was all about China, sure, but Japan has always been a big part of it.
For instance, Japan accounted for over 40% of trading volume in August. Japan has now officially recognised Bitcoin as a currency and is reworking its laws to make it part of its financial system... etc etc.
I guess this doesn't really answer the question "where does their enthusiasm come from" but I think the answer is... the Japanese just seem to "get" Bitcoin? Maybe it's like the way they're not scared by robots or AI in the same way the West is...

You can see hints of it here and there... but while it would be too easy to "blame the West" for what goes on, we should recognise that at the very least, the West is a sort of... allergen... that often makes Africa's problems worse than they probably need to be.

(*You won't read this but it was good brain exercise for me to write it, so thanks for the opportunity to rant if nothing else! Peace!*)
I apologise - the Netscape/Chrome analogy was muddled. In the browser war analogy, Bitcoin is in fact Internet Explorer. It became dominant, then it became the default, then it held off the smaller but super vocal Netscape Navigator (that claimed to not just do what IE did, but do it *better* and more true to a *noble standard* etc), then held off attacks from the government (antitrust), then it held off the Mozilla Foundation and Firefox and a million "alt browsers", then it saw AOL kill support for Navigator - not a DECADE before Chrome, but seven months actually, announced in late 2007 and done in Feb 2008 - and then just when it looked like IE was headed for eternity, bam - Chrome drops in Sept 2008 and everything changes. (And there's Safari off in the weird corner. Safari is IOTA, I'm saying.)
The point is that right now, Bitcoin is unassailable as a cryptocurrency for a number of reasons MOSTLY to do with the way ordinary people hate making choices about crap like this, so they just use "the one that came with my computer". Like people in the 1990s "clicked on the Internet", people in the 2020s will "pay with the Bitcoin."
I will upgrade my assessment from Bitcoin *might* be disrupted in 20 years by a better thing. After thinking a bit more, I now expect, given historical precedent, that Bitcoin will *almost definitely* be disrupted by a better thing in 20 years. Give or take. It might be sooner. The cycles are accelerating, after all.
However, you will note back in browser-world, Microsoft hasn't given up. I personally don't like Edge very much, but I have to admit it seems to run pretty well...
Some other points...
**1. Predicting Bitcoin's future value.**
Precisely? Of course not. But it is fairly straightforward to make usefully general predictions based on observed levels of interest and adoption. Trading on the abstractions of price and buying and selling patterns is a fairly developed... um... art.
**2. "Can't say the Bitcoin phone 10 is being released soon"**
This is very precisely wrong. Bitcoin, unlike "the dollar" is being continuously worked on, and the changes to the system are debated and debated endlessly. It's a collaborative process, and while there are issue surrounding who hold the *most* influence (and how we need to fix that), there is ALWAYS some new "thing" for Bitcoin on the horizon. Big blocks, SegWit, 2X, LN etc etc. This stuff makes people excited and it influences buying behaviour similar to Apple saying "the iPhone 12 has been delayed to 2032."
**3. "Not a tangible tech product"**
We have extensive experience as a civilisation in dealing with and pricing "intangibles". Is music tangible? Is a $100 copy of Windows 10 tangible? A motivational speaker or stand up comic's performance? A videogame purchased through Steam? Does Bitcoin's lack of ARBITRARY pricing - where one dude or a boardroom says "set the price to $299.99 because we say so" - confuse you?
Every "price" expressed in numbers is abstracted in some way. The only real "prices" are things like "four hens for one pig". We do just fine with intangibility.
**4. "What is it exactly that you base a price assessment on?"**
Do you see that the price of stock is equally bullshit? What does it mean? Why is stock in XYZ LTD $1000? Because the company is doing well? Why does the number $1000 mean "doing well"? Why not $800? Oh, 10x earnings? Why 10x? Why not 7x? Etc etc. BTC's price is in many ways much more *real* than a stock price, because Bitcoin's price is buffeted by various people saying dumb (or smart) shit - *or literally the hiring of a handsome well-spoken CEO** - but ultimately the market - the action of people buying and selling - sets the price. 
Or rather, the range of prices in various fiat currencies on various exchanges.
**5. "What bitcoin product is so in demand that anyone would park trillions in Bitcoin?"**
The most essential "product" of all - confidence that when you say to someone "you need to give me $4000 for 1.0BTC because that's the price that the world says it is today", they say "sure, here's my $4000." Bitcoin could become a *universal language of value*. It is not indelibly associated with a particular country or particular political philosophy (except tangentially to libertarianism). When China "bans" Bitcoin, they are banning it because "we want to protect people" or some bullshit, not "we refuse to recognise the capitalist pig dog elephant warthog mouse false American dollar." Bitcoin reduces *tribalism* when it comes to currencies - in the same way that gold did. Bitcoin is poised to become far more *real* as a marker of value than any currency tainted by the poli*tics* of whichever poli*ty* drew the pretty pictures on it.
**6. "Don't think we have paid gold coins in a few hundred years..."**
Go read, seriously. The gold standard in the US ended in 1971, a mere 46 years ago. There are many people still in the prime of their life who "paid in gold coins". Maybe not for a coffee, but to secure their personal fortunes? Gold. As for why I bring it up in this context... do you even read bruh? Gold is in the media every other day right now. "Oooh should we bring it back, why gold is the ultimate store of value, gold is safer than anything else blah blah blah." 
Again I say - the hammer is going to fall on the market at large and people are talking about how to survive it. The question of a "store of wealth" is a big one, once again. People are asking about gold - which as you say has been in some ways "out of use" for a few decades, though it never really went away - and they are asking about how gold can work in a modern context. 
And, again I say, in a world where you can buy a fucking car over the internet, having to rely on a chunk of heavy metal as your "final bank" when there is all this infrastructure around that runs effectively at light speed, is NOT super-compelling.
If you're holding $4,000,000 of BTC and you have NO fiat, and your kid gets sick and you need $500K to save her life... well, you just sell some BTC with a few clicks. If you have no fiat and $4,000,000 in gold.. that's slightly over 209 avoirdupois fucking POUNDS of GOLD. Where the fuck do you store that safely without having to rely on a third party (that provides security for a profit)? And how do you get $500K out of your gold without, again, having to hire an actual man to go into a vault with a really strong canvas bag to schlep a little over 26 avdp pounds of bullion to a broker who will weigh it and - possibly literally - carve off his "share" before giving you a bank cheque you need a bank account actually deposit and blah blah blah. Jesus even just *typing* that was exhausting. In any situation below the level of "total destruction of entire social infrastructure and all computers everywhere" - Gold just sucks!
Anyway you didn't read that paragraph of course, so let me say again: gold is being talked about a lot these days, pull you head out of ~~your ass~~ the sand and do some reading.
7. Slow transactions
Oh shit, the system isn't perfect on day one? Oh well fuck it, it's probably doomed.
8. It is 9 years old and that is so old man.
So because BTC is nine years old and has had nine years to test the waters and move from ultra-niche ultra-deep-core-cypherpunk hobby to king geek club token to sort of black market casino chip, to semi-real money, to a thing that people who sell organic muffins now accept as payment for organic muffins... it probably won't amount to much? Yeah that's a dumb take.
**Bottom line? If BTC fails we both end up with nothing. If BTC succeeds I end up with huge purchasing power for the second half of my life, a period I anticipate will last at least 50 years and possibly longer, and you will be caught up in whatever overly-complex, kick-the-can-down-the-road scheme governments come up with to shore up their flimsy monopoly (literally) money...** *again*.
