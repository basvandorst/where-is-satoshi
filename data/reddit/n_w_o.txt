Thanks. I was sure it wouldn't have been that simple here.

If selling for bitcoin in the us, I believe, you need to keep right books on the trading price at the time of the sale so the IRS can tax you appropriately. They took it upon themselves to declare btc property, not currency. Reverting back to a physical note seems like adding much more work on the backend if you intend to claim your earnings on your taxes. Or am I missing something here?

God job. I accept them at flea markets and swap meets. Have to educate close to ten ppl a day what they are, argue with one that insists it's bs and get a high five from 2-3 ppl that know what is up. I accept litecoin to!
Everybody should get their fingers into crypto coins. This place  literally gives all types for free(can use fake info 
They are a multiwallet site that's in beta now...giving away coins. Get some then you'll be more interested on using them.

Thanks for your review and bringing this service to my attention. I'll have to do some research now. Any Americans using this card care to comment please?

It wouldn't be so gross I'd those watts were solar generated. But that won't happen until after the last batch is mined,2040ish...if we're lucky.
