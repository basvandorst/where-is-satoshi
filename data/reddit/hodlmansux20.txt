Just look at blockchain everyone mines 1MB blocks and respects the Satoshi's limit.
That's all you need to know.

Addresses shall not be reused. One reason is someone could premine a doublespend and dump it after getting the goods as described in the original satoshi whitepaper, second reason that the koblitz crypto suffers on low-randomness devices.

ask yourself the main question: How is doublespend resolved? A doublespend is when user sends the same coin both to the merchant and back to his own pocket.
in physical world the doublespend is duplicating card and withdrawing from two atm's at the same time.
or paying with a counterfeit bill.

It's not over yet they're heavily invested to manipulate the Satoshi Bitcoin rules, but fear not we stand strongly by Core and they shall not overcome !!
They can birbe some core devs but that is all, no the core won't change the BLOCK SIZE!!!!! This is not over.
