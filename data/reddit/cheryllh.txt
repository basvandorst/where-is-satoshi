The best way to get them is to earn them as income. What skills do you have? Follow Coinality.com. You may be able to find work you can do, and someone who will be happy to pay you in Bitcoin. Read or listen to anything by James Altucher, who wrote "Choose Yourself," and read The Teenage Liberation Handbook. Become a part of the Bitcoin community. Volunteer for a Bitcoin company, if you can find one in your area. Volunteer for one remotely. Offer to help people for free, until people start offering to pay you. That's what I did with editing and writing.

Are you telling everyone around you about Bitcoin? If so, what are their responses?

To be completely accurate, this is not a man who has "lost" something. This is a man who has been stolen from — by the very same people who told him they'd keep his money safe.

Keep it up, guys. Lightlist provides the perfect opportunity  to donate to a Lighthouse campaign for a cause that is local to me, to a charity that has so graciously accepted generocity from the Bitcoin community.

Like interactive video gaming was a fad because Atari died. Not quite comparable, but even if Bitcoin died, the spirit behind the technology wouldn't. It would be recreated as the Xbox and Playstation formats of Bitcoin.

There will soon be other options, such as Foldapp, which works with Starbucks now, but I hear they will be adding other merchants that accept gift cards, such as Target, Walmart, Amazon, etc. I buy my cards last minute at the register, too, after I've added all the items in my cart. Usually groceries at Target. I also buy cards while in line at Starbucks. I won't be happy if I can no longer do that.

I still have the option to use whatever Bitcoin wallet I want. Did this change come with an update? I have neither Coinbase nor Bitpay on my phone.
