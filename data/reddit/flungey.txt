I never once acted like I have a special case, what the hell is your problem? (other than the obvious rant above, did I really anger you that much to employ a full paragraph to convey it?)
Also, I'm not quite sure you understand what a "hobby" is, it is not a profit making act.
Thank you for your input regardless.

Excellent, thank you for taking the time to provide some advice, I will look into the ASIC miner option in a little more detail and see whats best to do.

Thank you, I do understand the basic's of bitcoin however did not choose my words correctly however again your advice seems to match the above, I will explore this option.

Ah, nice one, thank you very much, this type of thing is more likely the route I would be looking at.

Thank you for the advice, I was not aware that GPU mining is now basically not an option, I will explore the above options and take your advice.
The trip card setup would purely have been for BTC purposes, my current gaming rig is more than capable however it would have been a bonus to have some extra equipment kicking around.
Thank you for taking the time to respond.
