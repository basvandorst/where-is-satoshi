what about, hypothetically, someone had 10 bitcoins on a thumb drive and they died? Are those coins lost forever?
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:50:40
I'm hungry now
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:58:08
what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:00:16
but it was on twitter! it must be true!
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:07:13
the old half penny, anyone?
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:30:28
drugs are bad. bad as in good

You see that crap also on very expensive guitars that have mostly been built by machines in bulk, yet are still expensive. Price is subjective, like value - when do they ever correlate? 
A diamond bandsaw sounds like a nice bit of kit. What's the blade width? 
It is a great hobby, btw, I agree.

It wasn't intentional, sorry, I also dislike all caps. It's like someone is shouting at you. The caps were on from captcha solving. It won't happen again, I promise and everything

funnily enough I've just started selling jewellery in BC,  although I'd imagine there are a fair few women already using it. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 12:25:02
thanks, xrandr, that is enlightening. I did do all that although there was no drop down box for the categories. I'll try again &gt;&gt;&gt;wait there
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:04:55
yes, your majesty, anything you say
@_date: 2013-05-28 07:45:25
as if anyone would go out with me
@_date: 2013-05-13 07:59:21
It's an area I'm not too clued up on, I used to use gnu/linux but since my laptop died I've been on my girlfriends mac. I prefer gnu, personally. Thanks for the advice, I'm looking around for a new machine.

I've seen mother of pearl that is not even half a millimetre thick on black plastic, that kind of thing? Turquoise is opaque, though. Why don't you make jewellery anymore?  
@_date: 2013-05-27 21:33:03
just looked up Terrence Mckenna, he's on Boss Drum by The Shamen,  . Never knew who this weird voice belonged to
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:41:38
yeah. To be honest I use anything that's lying around, I'm not fussy as long as I get to spark it 
@_date: 2013-05-12 12:34:05
ah ha!!! I see. I'm hungover
@_date: 2013-05-12 12:27:53
there is a 'category' heading, like the 'description' or 'shipping to', but there is no dropdown box. oh well.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:25:11
my girlfriend is starting to get it, far quicker than I did. Surely anything that makes shopping easier and more fruitful is a winner regardless of gender? plus the middlemen taking money from transactions like parasites are getting diddly squat
@_date: 2013-06-03 05:12:31
very insightful, the guy knows his stuff
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:29:59
a thin slice backed with black .... what on earth are you on about? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:42:09
put some here 1Li6fgXqBPY2HyraDcBSkwf7SyvjdRUbxg there are worse ways to spend them
@_date: 2013-05-15 08:02:34
are you experienced ? have you ever been experienced? Bit of Jimi there. It sounds like you didn't and don't know what you're dabbling in. You say yourself, "risking". Would you spend two months picking fruit on a farm and then moan when you blew all the money at a bookmakers? I'd wager that you would. 
Don't give up, there are plenty of gambling sites accepting bitcoin or any other currency you might want to speculate with.
@_date: 2013-05-28 08:22:11
why are you trolling? do you have anything constructive to add? Real life means people actually giving me money for my services or products. In real life. A one bitcoin valuation? three months ago that wouldn't have seemed so expensive. In three months - who knows? Hold back on the insults and pithy remarks, please. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:06:08
take your time, enjoy the ride
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:15:07
it's also here at coingig 
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:21:07
you are sharp!
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:24:32
this is a force of human nature and it will prevail
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:16:43
This is a place to buy and sell real objects and pretty wares. I'm hoping it will become a verification portal for legitimate sellers as there seems to be a lot of scammers out there. Send me a link and I'll RT
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:50:06
will check them out

82% of all statistics are made up on the spot
@_date: 2013-05-28 07:57:08
in real life my work goes for around about that. I've never sold at craft fairs but I'd say your estimate is correct. A craft fair is one up from a car boot sale.
@_date: 2013-05-13 08:20:32
like Highlander, there can only be one

it is a faceless movement, anyone extolling its virtues generally receives derision. As soon as Mrs Smith or Jones or Wang or Watsernamey start doing their weekly shopping with bitcoin it will have arrived and will have won. Women are the key. I mean that in a non misogynistic way, women are better at spending money than men are, generally.
