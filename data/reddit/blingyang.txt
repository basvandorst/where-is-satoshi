Govts can issue currency on a bitcoin like blockchain, collect taxes, pay salaries and conduct experiments like UBI. It would make governance much more efficient and cut out so many middleman.  
The problem is we do not yet have a reliable scaling solution for blockchain that can handle a lot of transactions per second. When such problems are solved, we might have many competing currencies and most of them will be issued by central banks and corporations and there would be a fair market place for currency exchange based on supply and demand.
Like Someone else said, we might have Central bank currencies, Corporation currencies and Currency of the people.

If you live in a developed country, and the existing system works well for you, you might have difficulty envisioning a peer to peer based system to keep track of debts and assets. Many people today do not see the value of bitcoin compared to fiat currencies because their currency works well for them.
People maintained ledgers of debts and assets long before governments and modern states formed. 
Lets say you take a mortgage on a house and tokenize this debt. This means, we now have 10000 "MYHOUSE" tokens managed on a blockchain. These tokens total worth is the cost of the mortgage you took. The owners of these tokens get monthly cash flow. Now there is a marketplace for these tokens. There are buyers and sellers of these tokens. These are completely liquid tokens that can be traded with out any central party on a blockchain. You can do the same for other assets like "MYCAR" or "MYWINDMILL" etc. 
Because of the liquid nature of these tokens, you can assign a transparent ownership structure to assets around the world. You can do this at individual level, cities, municipalities, states etc can do in their jurisdiction. People can convert their money into ownership of great things humans build. Every town can have its own stock market and bond market run by protocols and algorithms.
The advantages we have over a centralized systems are, people can own these tokens anonymously and trade with each other without depending on someone else far away like the wall street or the federal govt.  
Blockchain does not know the value of tokens being traded, its just protocol and mathematics but a centralized system and the people running it know the value of assets traded on their database, it becomes a target for politicians to dip into it with disregard for the owners of these assets.

There will definitely be evolution in currency implementations depending on needs and wants of users and their context. 
People abuse pseudo anonymity of bitcoin, some other currency that solves that problem will become useful for certain txs.
Similarly, scaling or tx speed or some other usecase becomes important and people will gravitate towards it. 
As with any software, users loyalty to a product has limits. At this point bitcoin appears much better than the alternatives.

Debt money dilutes all money. Prices of everything go up. 
Access to debt becomes a commodity and people who manage to get debt money end up having an advantage over people aiming for organic growth bound by natural laws of supply and demand. 
With debt money you drive out all competition and conquer a market and cause monopolies.
If rate of growth of debt is higher than productivity, the debt can never be repaid and creates a never ending cycle of more borrowing, this divides the world into borrowers indebted to lenders.
The whole toxic cycle takes the market dynamic away and leaves the most productive people at a disadvantage and the non productive administrators at the helm of economy.
[Edit]: Please note that debt creation is not a zero sum game. The money does not transfer from lenders to borrowers, the money just comes into existence because of Banking process.

You cannot wake up one fine day and build something like bitcoin over night or in matter of few weeks.
Satoshi could have been thinking about the problem for many many months or years. There is a lot of background here. Computer programming, peer to peer networks, cryptography, finance, economy, banking, systems design, distributed computing etc. And then putting them all together into working prototype.  
We are talking about decades of experience and understanding of many complex subject matters.
It might be possible that the 2008 crisis showed the need for a system like this and could have played a part in Satoshi timing the release of the paper and the prototype software.

One Good reason people will have trouble with bitcoin deposits is taxation. With bitcoin, People have an incentive to keep their transactions private and avoid tax implications. 
With custodian accounts, taxing people becomes very easy and people will lose sovereignty over where their money goes. 
Bitcoin offers a voluntary system where people can choose where to spend their money. This distinction is why it’s a digital revolution. You cannot achieve this with bitcoin deposits.

Refer to Credit theory of money
By definition all debt is created as an entry in the bank's ledgers out of faith that the borrower can repay the lender. 
So "debt in general dilutes all money"
The problem is how would anyone know that the debt is bad debt? It takes an extended period of time and the borrower goes through so many ups and downs and some may be able to repay and many fail to repay.
Many people want to categorize debt as productive debt vs speculative debt. e.g if you want to gamble in derivatives on wall street thats a speculative debt. The problem in real world is there is a fair amount of speculation every time banks create debt, e.g in real estate.

Read more about 1MDB scandal, a wall street bank charged a country 600 Million $ to raise bonds, You can do something like that for almost free on a public blockchain.
Blockchain offers an automated system managed by computers and math and is tamper proof. I can sleep well at night that no one will be able to hack into the central database or no one with malicious intentions can change the debt I hold or the amount of shares I own in a company etc. 
If blockchain is good enough for bitcoin, it should be good enough to manage debts, assets and ownership of the entire world.

Why would anyone block a particular port? That's such a random thing to do. It's something like your parent not allowing you to use blue crayon for coloring. 
Ports are just a convention. 
When one computer wants to talk to another computer, port is just an abstract idea to make things easier. Many programs running on one computer can talk to many programs running on other computers via different host:port format.
If we have to live with one port, it would be difficult for multiple programs to run on same computer and would cause a major rewiring of software to route all different requests via one port. 
There is no possible use case for blocking a particular port globally. 
In small networks, it is possible for network administrators to block certain ports to avoid non tech people from using off the shelf bit torrent or other copyright violating software.

There is a lot of blockchain hype for sure. A shroud technologist should be able to see through that hype and evaluate for its potential. 
The reason for blockchain is it’s tamper proof. No admin can tamper with the value created and maintained on blockchain.
You seem to be turned off by all the marketing bs around blockchain. You are evaluating the complexity of the whole problem with blockchain as it is today. All the problems you have about losing keys need work. Multi sig implementations and biometric technology will be able to automate some of those risky areas.
Blockchain is a very slow database but that is the cost of data synchronization from across a wide geographical area with data tamper proof guarantees.
People exchanged land titles long before governments formed. When they had disputes they would actual go to a reputed arbiter to resolve things. Blockchain is a neutral tamper proof slow database that acts as a source of truth for arbitration.

In existing banking, there is no difference between hard money and debt. The way banks create credit is non standard and the society needs a lot of trust that banks and people running these banks do not act in self interest.
In blockchain technology, hard money is bitcoin and all others like debt, equity and assets are tokens. This is a clear separation between hard money and debt. The tokens are completely liquid and follow the rules of supply and demand. This is so many times much better than existing system and has the potential to automate the whole of Banking in the entire world.

Actually the transaction costs are a problem and inconvenience but the real "robbery" is not that. Not even close.
The real robbery is happening at the "credit creation" part of the central banks. Central banks can issue credit to big businesses and governmental causes just by adding some numbers to their ledgers with out this money coming from anywhere or with out equivalent assets backing up the credit issuance. 
This is described as credit creation theory of banking. 
This is a very bad system which loans money for financial speculation, bails out failing banks and many other credit schemes that are not known to public. This is an unsustainable practice that is taken over by political forces. This is the single biggest reason for economic inequality.
For better or worse we do not have any alternate option. Bitcoin is too early to handle such a huge burden of the failing monetary system.

Kings and aristocracies did not think democracy was a good idea, because kings could make decisions for everyone faster and can enforce rules better etc..... 
But somehow the world transitioned to Democratic rule of law and made the world better for so many ordinary people.
It's not surprising that the existing financial elite think, they can make financial decisions for everyone faster and enforce rules better etc. But reality is completely different. 
Look at the world around you. The existing system of finance enabled state, local and federal governments borrow so much from future generations and it is almost impossible to pay off the debt. Where did all that money go? 
There is an overwhelming evidence that is enough to convince that existing system of finance is irredeemable.

Ipfs offers content addressable file system. It is technically possible to build a dropbox like app on top of ipfs, but in my opinion, a better implementation needs slightly different building blocks.
For a peer to peer dropbox, you need to chunk files into smaller units and store them on multiple places for redundancy and loss prevention. Then there are problems of how do you implement file sharing with others with out a centralized server. Its possible to build a good simple implementation but same service implemented using a client server model would outperform a peer to peer one.
You never know, some one else who thought about this problem might solve it elegantly by also offering micro payments for sharing your network and disc space.

Your description about storing of bitcoin is not correct. There is nothing to stash under the mattress in bitcoin and your hardware wallet or computer does not store any "bitcoins".  
The wallets store secret keys to how to spend the bitcoins on the bitcoin network. 
Having an account with bank with username and password is same as having a wallet that has secret keys.
What purpose does it serve to have a bank app on my phone if I can use a bitcoin wallet app on my phone unless I get some payment from the bank for using my bitcoins?

Pipernet will eventually end up being the internet we have today.
We had peer to peer file sharing apps, peer to peer video and audio streaming apps, but over a period of time, these models of service did not take off. Thats mostly because they are very difficult to maintain and nurture. 
In a client server model, you can easily find where the problem is, how to reproduce it and how to get it fixed. In a p2p network, applications become really difficult to build and debug. You cannot control network latency or bandwidth among various users and you cannot guarantee service quality. 
There are some people doing interesting work in this area. Like libp2p, ipfs and filecoin. These projects offer new primitives on which you can build decentralized applications but it is really very early to speculate about any killer apps that might be built using these tools that might look like pipernet on silicon valley.

This well understood problem has well understood solutions. Your understanding in this subject matter appears to be very very theoretical. You need life experiences to see the utility value of blockchain and also understand how life is outside the developed nations is like in terms and money and governance.
Ethereum and it's garbage marketing machine made "Oracle" to be a problem for blockchain integration into real world. Ethereum is a very poorly constructed system that does not reflect the real world.
Other blockchains elegantly get over this oracle problem really very easily. They just imitate what happens in real world and for most scenarios you do not need a large complicated central authority who can enforce a contract.
Let's just say you and I want to make a betting contract. I put some money, you put some money and we say that if weather tomorrow is less than 25 degrees, I win otherwise you win. It is a very artificially constructed asset exchange scenario similar to asset contracts that happen in real world. Now we need an oracle to verify what the weather is.
In real world, we can find a common third party we both can trust with task of giving us the correct data. This third party does not have to know any thing about our bet. The third party we both agree to has a public key. 
We now construct a contract enforceable by blockchain. You lock some assets, I lock some assets in this contract along with the public key of the data provider. The only way to unlock the assets and spend these assets in this contract is to provide a piece of digitally signed data by the owner the public key. The winner submits the signed data and assets in blockchain are spendable by the winner. If you do not like one source of data you can have a multiple sources and majority wins contract. 
There is a level of decentralization to such model of enforcing contracts with out depending on heavy bureaucratic enterprises. In most cases, People who form such contracts can depend on reputed local third parties to be source of truth for resolving their differences. 
There are working systems to build and play with such smart contracts. Many people are trying to extend bitcoin script to do all this. Bytom's equity smart contract language takes this to a whole new level.  There is a lot of activity going on in this space but unfortunately people in America and Europe are not interested in this because they cannot envision such level of decentralization and detachment from govt provided solutions.

Banks are a paper and pen technology where the rules of the game have evolved over a period of time and enforced by courts and armies.
Bitcoin is a computer and internet technology where the rules are well defined in code and enforced by mathematics and computers .
What is happening is the possibility of automation of almost all financial services. Banks, Wall Street and most of governmental structures  can be reduced to an app or simple software.
All this thing might take a very very long time and there would be a gradual progression for people to transition from existing way of life to a new model of finance.
Banks in current model serve two important purposes. Credit creation and accumulation of deposits into capital. 
This can be automated by software. Banks will have to evolve into fintech companies where their primary service would be creating software and helping people use their software. They will no longer be able to create credit like before.

If you believe blockchain is not perfectly tamper proof, you should let the bitcoin community know, we would all benefit by making it tamper proof. 
 
I have not read anything that argues that blockchain data is tamper-able or mutable. Even with a 51% of hashing ownership, it would be extremely difficult to reconstruct an alternative chain that would qualify as tampering the chain.
It is very easy to imagine a solution for everything with a trusted central authority because blockchain is very complex and difficult. In future, the technology could become cheaper and more sophisticated.

Autonomous money is the first part of the equation. The second part is digitization and monetization of assets.
In many developed parts of the world, assets like land, building and natural resources are converted to money back and forth very easily because of stable democracy and a working banking system that recognizes a market for assets.

Your argument is govt is too powerful and they can do what ever they want, whats the purpose of blockchain, lets just trust it? Or blockchain does not fix this problem perfectly so lets choose a centralized solution.
If you have land/title on blockchain two people can exchange the title/land with each other without depending on the govt. This is a self service system that people can use with less dependance on Govt to do everything for them. It probably meets the needs of majority of people and encourages voluntary cooperation and exchange. Role of Govt will be reduced to protecting the rights of the digital asset holders. If a govt is bad at enforcing the rules in edge case scenarios, there is no technology in the world that will fix those problems. 
You can design an election system on blockchain with out trusting that many number of administrators or actuators.

Actually, Robinhood is an example of someone else holding your bitcoin for you. A popular saying in crypto world is "not your keys not your bitcoin". So do not trust anyone else with your bitcoin.
With traditional paper money, you have an account with your bank, If you want to transfer money from your account, you tell your bank to transfer money from your account to someone else's account. 
With bitcoin, you are your own bank. If you want to transfer money, you can use a software or hardware wallet and transfer your money to someone else.
You can download a wallet on your computer or mobile phone. This wallet manages all the keys for you. You just have to remember a passphrase to get access to your wallet. You should keep your passphrase safer.

1. Network. bitcoin has a very large decentralized network of nodes keeping the protocol alive.  
2. Fairness in distribution of initial currency. Bitcoin evolved when no one else thought it would become store of value or money. The later currencies like ripple started as money and gave the initial distribution of their currency to insiders. There is a sort of evolutionary randomness and fairness in bitcoin distribution.
3. Total Supply. In bitcoin the supply is fixed. you cannot change the total number of coins in bitcoin network. This offers a clear distinction between money and debt.
bitcoin's niche is store of value.

“ If what you're referring to is fractional reserve banking, I would remind you that nothing prevents fractional reserve setups in crypto “
This is impossible in crypto world. The supply of hard coins is fixed and only miners can create new coins. No one else can just add new coins to the total supply.
Banks take your asset and use it as collateral and loan you money equal to the value of asset by adding numbers to their ledger. When ever banks do this, they are increasing the total money supply in the system. They remove this money when you repay the loan and take back your asset. They act as gatekeepers for adding and subtracting from money supply.
In crypto world, everything else other than hard currency is a token. So you will never need fractional reserve banking in cryptoworld.
Op is not wrong at all.

"Capitalist economic systems of fiat currency" mind = blown
bitcoin will not be able to solve all the problems of humanity. It only provides a system of currency with well defined rules as understood by everyone. 
It's a better alternative because the rules for how existing fiat system of money works are too complex, not the same for everyone, do not work in many places and has lead to violence, wars, destruction and suffering. 
There is no proof that bitcoin will overcome the limitations of existing system but its just a product of "spontaneous order" a non-violent force of nature that just came to existence like language and common social law.

There will be a maximum of 21 million bitcoins ever created.
The cost of bitcoin depends on demand for it.

Those are the fundamentals. 
Your question about wall street, economy and China can be answered with those facts. 
There is no secret sauce for anyone to manipulate bitcoin. The best they can do is waste their money and cause price fluctuations.

Your explanation of fractional reserve banking is incomplete and very misleading.
Banks take in an asset or “plan for an asset” at market value, put them in their balance sheet and create a dollar deposit(money) of equivalent value in their books. This is called balance sheet expansion.
By doing this, they just increased the total supply of money in the world. 97% of money in today’s world is created by this mechanism.
If banks do more of this, there will be a lot of money in people’s bank accounts but not enough physical cash. That’s why the reserve ratio of 10% came into existence. Even in cases of bank runs, the reserve ratio protects banks from running out of cash and losing public trust.
With electronic money, this reserve ratio is not even necessary.
In bitcoin world, this is not possible because the total number of bitcoins are fixed and no one bank can increase the amount of bitcoin in existence. Every other asset is a token and token’s value can be measured in bitcoin based on supply and demand for this token.

There are so many practical reasons why reserve banking is not feasible with bitcoin. The market forces are different because the underlying asset backing the debt has different properties compared to gold as in gold backed currency.
So far, we identified bitcoin and iou bitcoin are two different entities and total amount of bitcoins are fixed and total amount of iou bitcoins could be infinite.
This is the difference between hard money vs debt. In the world of bitcoin, debt will not go away. A bank can come in and establish a franchise and issue its token called Ioubtc and there would be a market value for this IOUBTC. Reserve banking could be one method of creating too many ioubtc tokens. A different bank with different reserve requirements and different reputation will have different token for its debt and it might have different market value. There would be a marketplace for all this kinds of debt Tokens. This is a much better alternative to central banking.
A nation state can come in and standardize this setup and create a bitcoin backed currency. That is an acceptable outcome. 
The discipline to this system comes from the fact that the total number of coins are fixed and scarce, the usability gap between bitcoin and ioubitcoin is very small. The cost of redeeming gold in gold backed currency was really huge and there are security and storage costs involved. Where as with bitcoin, you can redeem the ioubitcoin to actual bitcoin in just 6 confirmations I.e 1 hour.
The market value of your ioubitcoin token will change based on how soon you can redeem your coins. Overall this game s a huge improvement over our existing system.

Probably. It's actually really complicated. 
Mortgage loans or even any other loans in the world of bitcoin would have to follow a completely different model of borrowing and lending.
In your case, you should create 100,000 tokens for the house you want to construct and borrow for. You will have to sell these tokens in the home funding market of the future. The cost of these tokens would be determined by supply and demand for these tokens depending on the locality the house is in and the design of the house etc. These are cash generating tokens with an option for the token creator to own these tokens back over a period of time. 
All this could happen with out banks getting involved. There are still a lot of undefined components of this model that will eventually evolve.
It is debatable if the token model is better than the reserve system we have, it's just a concept.

A bitcoin and an ioubitcoin are two different assets. 
In case of blockfi, they are borrowing bitcoin from you and are creating ioubitcoin. They will lend this real bitcoin to someone else at an interest rate. They will pass the earnings from their borrowing activity to the depositors. 
How much can they lend and borrow depends on the market conditions and the risk they are assuming with out any relation to reserve ratio.
There is a cost associated with holding and securing gold so people preferred to keep iougold instead of gold. In case of bitcoin and ioubitcoin the costs are non existent so people might actually prefer holding real bitcoin and loan it to someone based on expected returns. Governments  took everyone’s gold by force and centralized it, it might be impossible to do that with bitcoin.
Bitcoin backed currencies bring discipline  to the financial system because the total number of bitcoins are fixed. This makes sure that large entities always trade in real bitcoins.

First advice. Do not invest your money yet with out understanding a lot more about this. 
If we converted from pounds to kilos your real weight would not change but only the numbers change. 
Bitcoin is something like that. We are changing the way we measure productive value and trade with a new system called Bitcoin instead of many other systems like dollars, yen and gold.
Where does this bitcoin's "outperformance" comes from? 
Bitcoin has value because other productive people are willing to trade their valuable stuff to this new system because they think it's better.
But there is no productivity here. Just like Gold you can put it in a box and nothing will change in the world where as there are people behind a stock who are working hard to make something useful and increase the value of your investment. 
There is an early adopter advantage that you have for holding a bitcoin. Other than that once many people shift to this new system, we will reach an equilibrium and things will look much saner then.

Dr Richard Werner is optimistic that by following some better ethics and prescriptions based on empirical studies by qualified researchers, central banks could be reformed into much better engines for prosperity for everyone. The problem is economics is not like physics and the "Animal spirits" leaves everything to interpretation and it would be difficult for smart people to agree.
To everyone else it is clear by now that money should be automated with mathematics and computer networks and there should be a separation between money and debt.

The world should allow even the bad actors to issue their own currency, But people should be free to accept/reject them.
The problem we have is walled gardens, monopolies and an illusion of choice. In such an environment it is difficult to trust closed currencies with hidden rules.

Borrowing money from not yet born future tax payers to service current tax payers is an example of Ponzi scheme. Thats a great abuse for a money system and is un sustainable. bitcoin is the best alternative we have so far considering a gold based system would be much more expensive to maintain and not so user friendly unless we have gold backed crypto currencies.

bitcoin is a programmable money because you can take a bunch of bitcoins (utxos to be precise) and lock them with a program. You can provide instructions in the program for the conditions that will unlock this bitcoins for spending. 
Some sample programs you can try right now are. 
You can lock the bitcoins with a secret password and anyone with that password can unlock and spend those bitcoins. 
You can specify instructions in the program that the bitcoins can be spent by a person with public address p only after a future date.
You can specify instructions that two out of three of the following people should provide their signatures to unlock and spend this money.
You can theoretically build complex programs that involve multiple people, multiple public addresses, signed data etc. 
For ex. 
You can choose weather.com as a neutral third party and you can write instructions in a program that if weather.com can sign a piece of data that on a future date weather is going to be greater than 100 degrees, you can spend this money. 
bitcoin has limited capability of this programmable ness. Some other later blockchains provide much better ways of making it a programmable money.

May be they are being sarcastic.

Or it's the other way around.
To enforce dollar or any paper currency as a standard, you need a powerful military. Otherwise how would you handle bad actors who violate contracts and keep the playing field fair?. 
Invention of bitcoin offers a different approach where no one party has to enforce the rules of the game. Instead, machines and mathematics will determine the rules of the currency.

I do not know if designing a perfect monetary system or a fair monetary system is possible due to its obvious complexity. 
From the book 5000 years of debt, it turns out that societies have been switching from commodity based money system to debt based money systems and vice versa every time to fix the flaws of the previous system. 
The invention of bitcoin for a currency and tokenization of all assets on a blockchain to represent asset specific debt tokens with currency like liquidity might be the perfect combination for a better monetary system that would not have been possible before.

Let me rephrase your questions using a different technology metaphor. 
Now that someone invented a car,  
1. Does it makes sense for the horse breeders to buy cars to go to work?
2. Will transportation continue in same pace as today when cars become primary mode of transportation?
3. Will Horse breeders adopt a different way of transportation by linking the horses to cars to marginally increase the horse power of their cars?
4. Will they still continue to breed the horses?
5. What do you think privacy look like?
Bitcoin is new technology and you will miss the big picture if you compare it to an older technology it is replacing.

Your understanding is not correct. 
Bitcoin is a store of value mechanism for the world. It cannot build new phones, gadgets and other productive things that people in the world do.  
How ever they can use the technology behind bitcoin to manage value in stocks bonds and other human arrangements.

The reason for your tech phobia is due to the abuse of technology and disproportionate benefits of technology going to a very few people. 
If humans ever invent a mind reading device it would have been one of the greatest achievements for mankind. Right now it looks like a scary thought.

Andreas is a technologist who has independent thought on this subject matter and has some expertise in this area to back it up. 
You can not compare the two.
