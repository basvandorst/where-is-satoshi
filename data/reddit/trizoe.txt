I did like how even the guy that got "scammed" is still a big supporter of Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:57:31
He is certainly still active. He is the co founder of Coinjar. The biggest exchange in Australia. Its a good site but I certainly don't keep my coins stored there!

Great point mate. When I read a story like yours I think of an African country or something, certainly not Argentina. Sometimes many of us don't realize how different things are for others outside the major western countries.
I hope you find a solution, I hope your government sorts their shit out and I also hope Bitcoin goes mainstream. Good luck mate.

I have no doubt that they were, and are absolute dodgy cunts. That Ken guy looks like the text book definition of a douche bag.
However the this is the sort of media scaremongering that will hurt Bitcoin and I expect more from the ABC. They are suposed to be impartial and I feel that their first major story should have reflected the facts not an "a current affair" type report on the subject.
For the international peeps "A current affair" is like AUS version of Fox. Trash news.

Not a first mate. Get your hand off it.
