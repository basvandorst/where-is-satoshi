Looks like that page is another "gov" propaganda fail!

That is a very clever idea.

It's an honor being part of this revolutionary human experience. Solute to all making the blockchain network.

My opinion is that this is by design. Speculations say btc will moon prior to halving; now would be an opportune time to knock off the small miners.
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:40:56
Moon is a term used to indicate an up trend in BTC

If btc is not energy storage then what is in my coffee I bought with btc? And why can't I reuse the energy as I pay my electric bill with btc I have made mining btc. So numbers do store energy, and can be converted into other forms of energy. value=energy and energy has value. What you suppose is that bitcoin is delivered out of thin air. It is not, simple physics, you put so much energy in to product x amount of energy back. It takes so much energy to produce an automobile then the manufacture hopes it can sell said automobile for more value than the energy to produce it. If they can then this value is then spent on more energy to produce yet more value. At a subatomic level it take energy to hold a form. Is the value of that form worth the energy put into it to hold the form? Or in Bitcoin is the value worth the energy? Hence the energy is the value; it is holding energy.

Coffee, 2 cartons of cigarettes, and 2 months. You want old school... go old school.

Always had to use a bank before also

I would argue that it already is a form of energy storage. Energy is converted into coin which then can be saved to purchase goods and services at a later time. This is the way of all things natural and made. Plants store energy from the sun; we humans make aluminum cans with energy, which in turn stores yet more energy.
So we already do store electricity in bitcoin to use later. Even at current difficulty we are still talking about 25% at 0.16kw. Where else are you going to get 25%?

Until the bitcoin community stops transferring transactions to fiat when talking about them....  So how much btc was that???? Change the world, change your thinking.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:38:48
500 coins, agreed! Nobody has 500 coin and not a clue what to do!

Wow 2 hours late to this one, had to stop and get coffee with my btc. Then stopped at the local independent gas station for some fuel bought with my btc but found I was running low on funds so I hit their btc atm with my fiat debit card so I would make sure I could get home with plenty of btc in case something happen. And it did coz my wife wanted to book a flight to Florida on Expedia with btc... lucky I hit that atm.

No not 300k, but it was a lot for me.  And I am not sure how to do pictures here. In truth it's a pain in the bum. It's a very needy car and not something you can just go out cruzing with.

Never invest what you can not lose. Hang on to your coin. However keep this term in mind, "panic buying." This is when a noob (newbie) buys on the up swing. It's exactly like the stock market in this sense. If you see the price jump up and think you should get in on the ride; it's already to late.

Buy low, sell high...buy buy low sell high low, buy sell sell, hoard bored. Sell high, buy low..... Geez, already quit with the BS, and open an ice cream shop that only takes btc. Build the infrastructure.

There are many truths. Will society collapse and we all turn "road warrior" mad killing everything? Of course not, but the world 50 years from now will not be one we will recognize. The issue is, will that world be of benefit to mankind or to just a few men?
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:15:20
Yes, I agree with you 100%. The ideals of the past are changing; need to be dismantled. Rebuilt without the "masters of men", at the helm. Let each be his or her own master succeed or fail.
@_date: 2016-07-10 00:36:37
Fractional Banking, neo-classical economics, and domination. Why would they change a thing when with each "collapse" or "crash" they pay themselves off and start all over the next cycle. They plant their minions to dissuade the coin; the idea that each can be his or her own bank. Shout that you can not succeed without them on every thread; with each post hiding their fear mankind will learn the truth. Your banks and corruption are not wanted and for sure unneeded.

You might not get much response on this because what you've described would be stealing bandwidth and electricity.

On a cheap antminer s4 you could expect 0.0018, by cheap I mean you can grab one for about $250.00 off Amazon. So you could grab 4. however you will also pay electric so cut that in half at the very least.
