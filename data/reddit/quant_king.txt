Great idea. I won't get into the weeds here, but that is not just a little bit... but ASTRONOMICALLY harder to do, so that's not presently something we have the time or money to do atm, but a guy can dream right, haha? In the meantime, we appreciate your support and feedback :)

Check out the README; it is all explained there. It uses GDAX only for now, Bitfinex to come, and to your second question, no--that is sadly not possible. Let me know if you find it helpful and we appreciate your support!

Hey all just wanted to post a thank-you for helping to make the crypto whale tracking app so popular since I released the new version last week. Really appreciate your support in all ways, and here's to a great night of trading--hope my app can help in some way :)

So it looks like whales that build walls found a work-around to my whale-watching app. Sucks for them though because I found a work-around to their work-around, so now even if the whales stack different orders of the same volume AND same price, I can still see that it's just one person behind a particular buy / sell wall. For anyone that hadn't heard about this yet (I know a lot of you have helped and offered advice so big thanks to you all!) check out the GitHub here. All you need is Python installed and you can run it locally :)
I brought this here because with one line of code it can be adopted to to Bitcoin/USD. Just let me know (comments or GitHub stars) if this is something you guys want to see / would use. Currently raising funds to host this on AWS.
PS, linking the donation address here (hoping to raise enough to host this on a website via AWS). It's also on the GitHub for those who don't want to click through: 0xc90d298285C98Dd6a6260b691173F1269cD56397

Many things.
Absolutely not.
Read the README to see why. Not attempting to be terse here, it's just all already explained and easy to see from the code, so no sense in attempting to re-write it all here, but you are far off.

Hey all. The Bitcoin whale-watching app I shared a little while ago for Python coders is now hosted sustainably online so now coding experience is required to use it :)
Check it out and trade smarter:

Thank you! If you find it helpful at all please do share and leave feedback via GitHub :)
We're also raising funds to move this AWS asap and are only like $800 away, so any donations regardless of size are greatly appreciated. Have a great night!

Haha sadly that would require a little different code!
