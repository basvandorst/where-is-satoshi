I think it was a person from mIRC. Around 9/26 I went to bitcoin channel seeking help and tip 10 bucks USD in bitcoins to his address. This was months ago. He could've been a big time player since he was in btc trade channel. I wouldn't doubt that. I have no way of contacting that person.

I think he was  a major player in the bitcoin mirc trade channel. Perhaps that's why the address has thousands of bitcoins. I'm not near a computer to survey the MIRC channel

How to determine how much BTC to buy:
Pick a $ amount
Imagine BTC is worthless due to a software bug. All that money is lost. Are you OK?
Yes: invest this amount
No: pick a smaller number and go to step 1
