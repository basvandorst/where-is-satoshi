I agree that the most likely future price for most commodities is somewhere around the current price. In contrast, the OPs model is predicting continued exponential growth based on past exponential growth.

It's quite simple, actually. For example, I care about the Bitcoin subreddit and would be happy to donate, say, $100 to the market cap of these colored coins. Others who agree could similarly donate and this added value would be distributed among the limited number of colored coins. Beyond this donated value, the subreddit could also give it value by rewarding flair for certain balances, etc. Then, these colored coins could be traded or we could tip for good content on this subreddit. To further encourage good content and to enrich our community, people could continue to donate to the market cap. 
There is no way to create a system like this without colored coins.

Your edit gets it right. The government couldn't mandate something like this and really the government has nothing to do with coinvalidate. Coinvalidate is a private service that hopes to provide companies like Walmart a way to check whether the BTC they are accepting as payment is linked to drugs/CP/paid hitmen/etc. Anyone could do this already--it is not changing bitcoin. Large companies will want to do this to avoid scrutiny from Feds for accepting "dirty" BTC. This is inevitable if BTC is going to have widespread adoption due to the publicly available blockchain. But really it poses little threat even to people who have used silkroad, etc as it seems to be something that can easily be surpassed by mixing services. The reason why companies don't do this with dollars is that there isn't a blockchain for dollar bills.

There are two Bitcoin funds. One currently offered by SecondMarket, and one that will be offered (and has been filed) by the Winklevoss twins. These are both trusts that hold actual BTC purchased from miners and exchanges and base their value off of these holdings. This is consistent with how all other commodity based ETFs work.
The conspiracy that you are basing all of your speculations on is that ETFs are going to offer "Bitcoin claims" (your words). Of course, this isn't true.

I have a similar amount of BTC and have elected for paper cold storage in a secure area. I don't have the time/energy/focus to follow all of these steps, but I think it's great if others are able to implement this.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:51:59
That's not how supply and demand works. The "lost" coins and "future" coins are already factored into today's price. If there was a million coins created out of thin air, then yes, that would cause inflation. The steady production of coins at a defined rate does not effect price. Similarly, if a large amount of coins were suddenly "lost" (eg, a fire at coinbase), then there would be some deflation. 
tl;dr- only new news matters. The rest has already affected supply and demand.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:20:10
Now that we're on the same page, my point was that Bitcoin funds do not lead to the "claims" fiasco that you were speculating because you don't get a claim to Bitcoins through the fund. You just get a way to invest in the potential of BTC without actually owning BTC (meanwhile, the Trust owns BTC, but you have no claim to it). There is nothing wrong with this and it is a powerful tool used in all commodity markets. Wall street will be a huge asset to Bitcoin (and vice versa).
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:33:08

It took me awhile to figure out what all the numbers mean.
The big green number is the total number of BTC purchased with fiat worldwide since you started watching (via listed exchanges only).
The green numbers beneath the red country codes are the number of BTC bought in each country and should add up to the big green number.
The red numbers on the next line down are how much of the country's currency has been bought in BTC.
The purple number on the next line down is the most recent exchange rate from the last purchase.
Each flying bitcoin symbol represents one purchase and it flies toward the country where it was bought. There is not always an increase in the country's small green number because some are less than 1 BTC. The dots and numbers that scroll across the bottom of the map are a record of the most recent purchases.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:29:20
BTC "transaction volume" is not what you think it is. When I move 100 BTC between addresses in the same wallet, that is counted as a 100 BTC transaction. Actual transactions for goods and services make up a smaller (but growing) part of this.

If I understand correctly, the table (below) is projecting **what the price of BTC will be in 1 year** depending on the % penetration and how many years it will take to achieve this % penetration.
Apparently, the current price of BTC is at where it should be if BTC eventually achieves 1% penetration in 10 years. It is **not** saying that this will be the price in 10 years.

Yes, but if you have to choose one, I would choose coinbase since it is based in the US and backed by companies like Google. It is not quite as safe as having money in a bank, since it is not insured, but at the same time we would have recourse if Coinbase tried to run off with our btc.

I agree that the upvote/downvote system generally highlights the best stories. I don't have evidence for this, but this is what I think is going on: there are 60,000 subscribers. On any given day, 80% of the readers are sporadic readers that come maybe once a week or when Bitcoin is making big price news. These people upvote price news to the top. The other 20% are daily committed readers who either don't mind or are annoyed by this.
So, while the upvote/downvote system is technically correct in that it highlights the stories with the most upvotes, it makes the subreddit somewhat less appealing by over reporting on the price.

I reviewed it again, and the ISO does not have a symbol for bitcoin. The 'X' is used for supranational currencies that aren't used on a large scale. For example, XCD (East Caribbean Dollar) is used for several Caribbean countries. Larger supranational currencies like the Euro (EUR) don't have the 'X' prefix. Since Bitcoin is a global currency and *large*-scale, I recommend we stick with BTC. It is less confusing for all involved and is already ingrained in our vernacular.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:20:37

I didn't realize this, but you are correct. 
Really it doesn't matter what we use in our shorthand as the ISO will eventually assign Bitcoin an ISO code regardless of what the new fad is on the forums or subreddit. Hopefully it doesn't start with "X," which is used for smaller scale currencies.

The point of the graph is that the number of BTC needed to be a "Bitcoin millionaire" is decreasing exponentially. You can use the equation to estimate the date when the # of BTC you own will be worth $1m. I will maybe repost/rephrase so this is more clear.

The question should be: what's wrong with using BTC? This is tried and true. BTC is a new currency and to constantly change the symbol and abbreviation is needlessly confusing and is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. There are minor reasons why the bitcoin symbol or "BTC" is not 100% perfect, but that is true with anything. The dollar sign "$" has similar "problems" (it is also used for the peso, etc).

2. Other people are comparing Bitcoin "transaction volume" to Western Union, which is inaccurate, because a minority of bitcoin transaction volume is people sending money overseas.
3. A large proprotion of this "transaction volume" is people moving BTC between addresses, BTC change being returned for small transaction, and speculation. As much as I wish otherwise, bitcoin is not yet a major player in everyday transactions (paypal) or in international money transfers (Western Union).

Yes, but the price is a reflection of the market's assessment of Bitcoin's chance of viability. Higher price = the market is more convinced that Bitcoin will be successful.


This is often said, but BTC *does* have real value in the same way that the dollar does. The value of Bitcoin is its utility as a method of payment or to store wealth. It does a lot better job at this than the dollar.


There isn't risk from competing crypto currencies due to the **substantial** network effects of Bitcoin. No other cryptocurrency is going to be able to overcome the Richard Bransons and Winklevosses of Bitcoin in the near future. I *do* think that private currencies like Ripple can be succesful in that XRP is part of a greater service offered by Ripple, but I do not think that XRP will compete directly with BTC.


Protection from inflation, diversification, eventual ease of use, low/no fees, privacy, potential for appreciation, eventual universality.
A question that I don't think can be adequately answered yet is whether deflation will be detrimental to BTC. This remains to be seen.

If you think BTC is going to supplant all of Wall Street and conventional finance, you are wrong. If anything, it will aid both by making us more efficient and productive with a reliable currency. This isn't some bullshit.

I suppose, however I wouldn't recommend storing coins on an exchange, I would move them to a new address and put most in cold storage.

Next week is going to be big for bitcoin. Here are a few reasons why:
- In DC, there will be a lot of talk about different ways to regulate BTC. This will really piss off the readers here and on the forums, but will lead to a BTC rally among the public as it further legitimizes the currency. This same thing happened after the FINCEN regulations.
- Days of increased media coverage will also lead to a BTC rally.
- Tomorrow is a weekday. Even if standard investors wanted to buy BTC now, most don't realize that it is exchanged 24/7/365

How is this an improvement on Twitter? I imagine the blockchain would be ginormous and cumbersome.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:09:39
Yes, the trendline is exponential. I agree that it can't last forever. However, it has lasted ~~two~~ four years so far. For companies, exponential growth continues until the market has matured or they go bust. I think the BTC market is *quite* a ways from maturity.

There is no claim to a commodity with a commodity ETF. Looks like that's where the confusion lies.

You can always load a public + private key into blockchain.info and go from there.

I'm thinking that they mean that they saved the blockchain locally so it was easier to analyze on a large scale.

I think you're confused. You are supposed to buy low and sell high.

Found a place for you: @_date: 2013-11-13 03:02:31
Well, then I think this subreddit needs to decide what its goal is. Is it trying to cheerlead BTC price increases or is it trying to serve as a meeting place for those most interested in constructing Bitcoin's future?
I understand the need to bring new people into bitcoin. However, those that actually stick around are going to be interested in more than just the price.
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:31:58
Coinbase stores the majority (don't recall specific  of it's coin offline. And, those that are online are scattered in servers in many different countries.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:00:35
Like I said, it depends how it is done. If they flood the market, perhaps, but they are disincentivized from doing this. If they sell slowly over time (eg, what criminal do in after a robbery: spend slowly), then it will be largely unnoticed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:17:59
That's weird, because you mentioned "claims" twice in three sentences when there aren't any. Seems relevant.

Did everyone record the price they originally bought each BTC for and the current price when buying a product in order to calculate the net appreciation for which taxes are due in the US? Just curious.

Past performance does not predict future performance (regardless of # of years). True for everything in economics and this is no exception. However, the fact remains that 4 years of exponential growth is exciting.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:03:10
Agree 100%. My post wasn't supposed to be investment advice. Bitcoin could fail, but another cryptocurrency would pick up where it left off.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:28:53
Yes, I was/am talking about an unrealized loss, which is what you get when you hold. Of course, perfectly timing the market with frequent buys/sells is the ideal but improbable. If you are the underlying asset is solid, buying and holding is the best approach.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:55:09
The opposite is true: the value of Bitcoin is *not* driven up by usage, but is driven up by buying/cold storage.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:07:59
Agree, BTC is vernacular shorthand for Bitcoin.

This is my last comment on this subject: the graph is nothing but a logarithmic representation of a standard bitcoin graph.

When I move 100 BTC from one address in my wallet to another, I think it is disingenuous to call this a "transaction." The same goes for when I use 100 BTC to buy something worth 1 BTC, and have 99 BTC returned to my change address. This is not a 100 BTC transaction. I agree that bitcoin is great and all, but it is not seriously competing with Western Union yet.

You are right that you don't get the commodity. Where you are incorrect is in thinking that you get a claim to the commodity. You get neither.

Plus they are using the hipster version of the bitcoin symbol.

Even if it is only a theoretical risk, it should be addressed. The goal is to make bitcoin as secure as possible.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:05:26
This is equivalent from a practical standpoint to a bank vault that requires either your presence for access or that of a DPOA (designated power of attorney).

Maybe it is a stupid idea, but it surely isn't a threat to bitcoin.

When something "crashes" every six days before recovering, you begin to realize that it is not really crashing at all.

Nope. Bitcoin has many uses, one of which is a store of value and another which is a method for transactions.
