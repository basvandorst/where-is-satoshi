Im mining for pennies... I love opensource, and my kids enjoys it too, because with Gentoo we can have one good pc with multiseat :)
Kids and linux are my life, mining too if i can make it profitable..

So its impossible to track down those who steal? 19000 btc without any risk - btc is not so good when it comes to security.

Why people are playing lotto? Someone cant afford 2 watts electricity I know... Every hash can solve block..

Install bitcoind or bitcoin-qt
Edit or add bitcoin.conf in linux its located /home/username/.bitcoin add these, change pass and username
Then start mining solo
cgminer -o 127.0.0.1:8332 -u xxxx -p xxxx
I think -u can be walletaddress, cant test it now because dont want to stop mining. You can try.
Open port 8333 for more connections and help others download blockchain.
If your connection is low speed reduce maxconnections to 10 maybe, 20 is very good with p2poolmining

Keep that wallet empty, or compile it with -wallet option enabled if youre thinking security. Doesnt cgminer use every asic it has drivers enabled that it finds with hotplug? Not sure how things are with windows..

If you leave node up and running, why not put one usb asic and try to find a block with it - someday there can be 25btc in your wallet?
