Quote stolen from 'bitcoin and friends'
Like I said that show will become huge with some tidying up.

This is so blatant though. I'm really shocked how few people can see this is inevitable. This is why things are so quiet right now.

Cannot believe the trade  volume from the UK. nobody hardly cares about Bitcoin in England.
That must be 97% central london banksters.

And Beckham who scored that iconic goal from the halfway line all those years ago will really inspire me to buy a Carling or purchase a Elonex computer?
These ads are aimed at financially savvy people and people who are good with maths and numbers. The masses don't give a shit, it needs to be fast, easy and risk free. Bitcoin is still way too complicated, new and full of risks for the masses to touch it.

Your clutching at straws. I've seen rolex or fancy watches adverts everywhere all my life but had no desire to every buy one.
When the masses have an everyday and easy way to use DLT they will, right now they don't. No matter how much you advertise in big sporting events.
Not to mention Watford who have bitcoin on their sleeves are bottom, to understand how little people care, Huddersfield last season had a chinese betting site on their sleeves and even the site and logos where all in chinese with no English translation

Bitcoin was always the real Trojan Horse with the elite hidden inside ready to create 'FEDCOIN'.
Bitcoin and most likely Libra are experiments to get the masses to go fully cashless which has been the elites plan for almost 100 years.
In the long term i feel none of this will end well at all for the masses. The writing is on the wall with all the fake people at the top in Crypto, bending over and waiting for the big elites to take over, pumping their bags to levels of generation financial utopia for the few.

Few to  nobody ever pays attention to the advertising hoardings in football/soccer.
You need to also realized 30%-40% of the advertising hoardings are usually betting sites displaying odds or some gambling, investment company, some adds are even displayed in full mandarin/cantonese at times advertising odds.
This game wasn't crazy either. It was one bigger team in Spurs easily destroying the other smaller team playing like shit in Burnley.
