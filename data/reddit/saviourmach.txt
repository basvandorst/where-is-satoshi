I commented earlier and gave you some constructive criticism, but now you seriously need to stop. You are completely utterly and entirely out of your mind. Go take a breather, get off the computer for a few hours, and come back later. You're a laughing stock at this point.

I know, and that wasn't what I meant. Sorry. I was referring more to taxation, regulation and the like.

Truth be told, you're probably right. I hope you do see my point, though. It's still so damn risky. Dangerous. I personally would like to see first what happens when government legislations and all meet Btc before I'd get involved to such an extent, though.

That's not an argument. 
It's a FACT bitcoin is unsafe. I'm not against bitcoin in any way, mind you, I think it's amazing, but that doesn't change the fact that in its current state it is an extremely unsafe place to store your money. 
This bank is giving him a hard time accessing his own money. So switch to another bank. Besides, having a hard time accessing your money is better than having your money vanish in thin air.

My bad, I misworded. 
I was more referring to the unreliable value of a bitcoin. It changes too much to be a reliable place to store your "real" money, all of it. You can't deny that. Again, I'm not bashing bitcoin, but I am 100% convinced putting ALL your savings in bitcoin borders on lunacy. 
EDIT: Yes, I know it has been going up mostly, but we all know it's going to go down (probably only temporarily, but still) before long. And then back up. Etc. You'll never be sure how much your lifetime savings are even worth.

Whatever, pal. Have another drink. Or two. 
You're talking from your feelings and emotion, not from economics or any form of knowledge whatsoever.

I just wanted to say this is a very interesting thread to be reading, from an outsider's perspective. 
I'm not agreeing with anybody. However, for the love of god start paying attention to how you type. Unbelievably hard to take you seriously if you can't even type your own language properly. Presuming you are from the US, that is. And read back your discussion with boredsoanswers. You're so wrong it's straight up hilarious.
I don't own bitcoin, but I know finance. is spot on. 
EDIT: The image that popped into my mind is of the original poster as herald, or as one of the prophets on the market square in ancient greece. No insult intended, just a funny thought.

If this man's savings were to have been in bitcoin, he would have lost 20% of his savings in this evening. 20% gone. 
Investing in bitcoin gives hope for gains, yes, and should be done. But not with all your savings - with money you can miss if it goes wrong, instead. 
A 2% per year devaluation? I would consider that stable. Bad news, but relatively stqble. Bitcoin devalued 10 times that in one evening. Sure, it'll get it back, but still.

I would very strongly recommend you do NOT put all your money and savings in a bitcoin wallet. Just find a different bank instead.
You really want all your savings to be that unsafe? They could be worth half of what they are now in a week. Or they could just get hacked. Or any imaginable kind of new legislation could show up. 
Careful, pal. You wouldn't be the first losing all his money for no reason. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:04:33
Why would it? It's way more stable. For now, anyway. 
(Note I'm European, so if you get overly technical some slight extra explanation might be needed)

It wasn't a compliment.
