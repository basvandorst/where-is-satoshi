Can someone briefly explain the effects of the fed rates to BTC and real life please? I don't quite understand it. Is it inflation going from 2.00% to 2.25% meaning our money is worth less annually?

I buy. From CB then transfer to gateio and it works perfectly fine. I rather keep it in coinbase vault cuz I feel it's safer
