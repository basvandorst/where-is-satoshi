Same here. This is the only one I ha e that is fancy ;)

We were a lot of people pushing for silver at that time. Partly because silver and gold prices didn’t match the approximate ratio in the ground (still very very true... silver costs next to nothing in this context), but mostly for the wide range of actual industrial applications for which it is used. The fact that silver has intrinsic value and natural scarcity was what made it attractive as a store of value for us.

First - Yeah, there is a typo but the headline clearly states that crypto won. And it was for good reason. There is no discussion, even though you seem to be looking for one.
Secondly - comparing silver with helium is one of the dumbest comparisons I have heard so far, and I’ve been in this space for a lot time and heard a lot of dumb things. 
What you don’t seem to be aware of is that at one point, let’s say in 2009, there were two camps - one focused on the representative nature that currencies can have and one focused on the mechanics around currency. The first mentioned camp morphed into what was labeled “the sharing economy” whereas the crypto camp kept their head down and focused on delivering a viable alternative currency. The silver movement was somewhere in between these two camps - fascinated about the mechanics of currency but reluctant to compromise on “value”.

$12 for coffee... no, I really can’t believe it.

Well... I bought almost all the way down, so I’m well in black nowadays ;)

I have the exact same feeling! When I read about people panicking my inner voice is more like “Crash?... You don’t know what crash means, child”

The same year as it has been so far - The year where general awareness of BTC is low.

Hahaha... I thought you were being a dick. Sorry! I think it’s a 2001, if I don’t have it wrong.

Oh, it good, for sure. But it’s still the one I use the least, hence this thing. Don’t need to sell it and don’t need it. Why not experiment?

I hear you weren’t around when the Internet and WWW started to take off... Back then people didn’t see the transformative power of being able to connect to a global network, and travers it via links, and how that would come to impact e.g. commerce and much much more. A few did, but not the masses.
The pattern now is the same, and the people that are the most excited are the once which recognize this, I think. No one really knows where this will lead, but it will for sure be transformative beyond our current imagination...
