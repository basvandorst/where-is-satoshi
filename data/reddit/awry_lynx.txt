Yeah. I'm not saying it isn't possible or they can't be hacked, but it would be a super long con lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:34
Don't you wish you'd actually gone all in here? Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:48
It's more gold at this point. A commodity. It's not really a stock in any way. But people put their money in gold (bitcoin) and then hope it appreciates in value.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:12
But isn't that the point - that it's unregulated? How could someone even regulate bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:45
relax it's the volume. it'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:25:04
To be fair, the gold rush worked out for a number of people. Just don't die of dysentery.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:07
Even if they are computer literate the volatility is still scary lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:22
Even if it fell 20-40% in the next few weeks it'd still be more expensive than if you bought like, last week. Probably.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:25:11
Ouchhhh. The good news is, even though it feels like a huge deal - nobody could've predicted the future accurately back then and the people who did were mostly nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:33:06
Very likely. Still going strong though on the rebound.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:29:45
Yeah, bank accounts take longer bc the bank has to validate it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:00
Not a correction lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:48
Everyone is buying at $something and nobody is willing to sell except at $morethansomething so there's a 'wall' of people waiting to buy at the lower price. Or a sell wall which is where everyone wants to sell at a discrepancy to what people are willing to buy at.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:39
Why didn't it correct at the major point of 10k then?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:23:17
Is that even possible? Just thinking about the sheer volume of people who would immediately bow out because at that point it's lifechanging money... what would that spell for bitcoin's future?
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:00:26
I have a Coinbase buy transaction that’s been pending since dec 6, I’m not worried (yet) but the money was gone from my bank account a few days ago... so should I be? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:23:42
As soon as they build up a reputation they get shut down, pretty much. There are a few that might not be AS questionable but... still pretty iffy. I wouldn't do anything super-sketchy besides personal use amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:20:20
“BTC has been silent” Sorry how does it talk 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:38:41
You'll be fine!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:10
IT'S GOING TO 20 BABY
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:39
Yeah. For some people the value of the btc they're holding rn is lifechanging. I know HODL HODL HODL but seriously, if you can get out of debt and never have to work again...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:35
I do wish... god damn. It's crazy. Almost EVERYONE I know has that "oh god, I almost invested back when it was *x*, the regret kills me" story. Actually, a couple of my friends have a variation "oh god, I've been buying bitcoins for five years and immediately spending it on drugs" some of them have been brave enough to add up the totals...
I think it kind of changes things to realize your weed habit ended up having an opportunity cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars... *but* at the same time they never would have just held bitcoin without that? So. Uh. I don't know. Don't have useless regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:05
16k... the volatility is insane
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:40:42
It's what people thought about 100, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 10k, 15k, etc etc etc. I'm not saying those people were wrong because it may well drop  under, but timing the market rarely works out well. Sometimes unexpected things happen. I'm positive there will be a 10-30% correction this month or early next... just a question of what heights it rises to beforehand.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:38
and they're gonna have some outdated numbers haahhaa
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:36
holy fucking shit! this is unbelievable. i'm excited but also extremely anxious. when does the ride peak???? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:19
Also, it's not like the websites were just useless after that. Bitcoin might be massively overvalued now but once this many people have knowledge of it (and more will!) the actual use cases will grow.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:15
bitcoins are tulips
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:34:18
Not to mention, SO many people are waiting/practically begging for the dip that I imagine after it dips it'll be left at record highs basically in the same fucking day.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:11
Yeah, that they should get in faster on the next big thing lmao. Everyone knows "that one dude who got super rich off of bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:27:24
Aaaand here 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:34
Yeah my friends keep asking me to "let them know" when it's down to x. I'm here like, yeah, sure... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:29:20
It locks in to when you entered it BUT sometimes they cancel it if it doesn't get confirmed in time or something. You don't 'lose' money exactly, they aren't taking anything from you, but it still sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:33:50
Looks like they’ve updated things in the past month. Makes sense. Is volume higher than past peaks? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:53
HOly fuck it's almost 20k
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:52:43
Commodity is the word. It’s like gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:28
Yep! Kind of. Does it really still count as a correction if it's still up 20% from yesterday though? LMAO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:39
Yeah, no way. 20k I can see. 50k ain't happening before 2018 or i'll eat a dick.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:35:04
Anything is possible. It could go up to 50k before the end of the year. It could also potentially drop to 5k. None of that would be a more extreme % change than what's happened in the past. Isn't that terrifying? Volatility with crazy volume...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:05
Bitcoin has increased in value 2000% since the beginning of this year.
It could fall to 4k and it would still have beat just about any market over a year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:05:02
hot damn time to buy back lol
