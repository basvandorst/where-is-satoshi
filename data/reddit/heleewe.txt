Not a lawyer, but you're a gift recipient. Can you get in trouble if your distant uncle sends you a birthday present and charged it back? What about ? Now if you knowingly accepted a gift this way, maybe. Most buyers on purse.io seem like Mechanical Turks.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:51:20
Thanks for this. Did a quick search on App Store, and there are choices (most cost money, one costs $49.99). Anyone else use PGP and iOS?

Agreed. Bitcoins are a pain in the ass to get. Why would you pay fees to get bitcoins just to turn around and spend them?
I saved 20% on my last Amazon purchase through PurseIO. That makes it worth it. Then rebought on Coinbase.

I tried brawker, but they displayed my shipping address on their order book. Canceled but took much longer than I wanted! Purse uses Amazon to hide shipping address. I don't know about you, but I don't want my shipping address available to the public.
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:20:33
Go to "Buy Order" on Brawker. You can literally see everyone's public shipping address. That's where people live. That's fucking awful. I'm not even going to post it here because I don't want to promote exposing user addresses.

People are already doing this through [Purse]( AND saving 20%. Just bought a new MacBook Air for $600 in BTC. Plus, they don't sell your bitcoin, and it goes to someone who pays for it with Amazon gift cards.
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:39:05
Compare $1.3B annual sales at Overstock with [$74B at Amazon]( With that comes a heck of a lot more inventory and cheaper prices. Overstock is great member of the Bitcoin community, but this headline is exaggerated. Sites like [Purse]( provide access to everything on Amazon internationally and 15% discounts by providing a means to liquidate Amazon virtual currencies for Bitcoin.

Try Purse.IO. I think it works in the UK.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:23:24
Best stats I've seen for any Bitcoin company. Processing $1m daily from 44k merchants; 1/2 convert immediately. Hella sell pressure.
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:20:24
Even better. I put in an order for a $500 Amazon gift card at 35%. It went through... will update on whether it arrives.
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:17:50
PurseIO solved this problem. It's 10-25% cheaper to buy stuff on Amazon. It's one way to take advantage of the Bitcoin economy - make marketplaces that drive efficiencies.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:06:30
I think the buyers there pay a premium because it's an easy way for them to buy. Buyers can essentially buy bitcoins with a credit card. I don't think PurseIO charges fees for the buyer, so maybe they're willing to buy at a higher rate?
@_date: 2014-05-06 19:25:20
Agreed. Thailand is beautiful, has great food, and awesome weather. I spend a few weeks there every other year. Love it. A thriving Bitcoin community would only make it more awesome.

Bitcoin has been compared to many different assets including Gold, USD, Siliver, other commodities, etc. But the comparison to a private tech company is probably the closest to reality at the moment. Both in valuation / market cap and volatility.
Without getting to too technical, the value of Uber depends on its cash flows which I imagine are pretty high considering their margin.  Bitcoin's market cap, however, doesn't have inherent cash flow.  Even the Fed has cash flow that it pays back to its investors, but Bitcoin does not. 
Bitcoin's value is the ecosystem including the r/Bitcoin community (way more active than r/Uber), the startups investing time in Bitcoin, the investors seeding these startups, holders, traders, evangelists, etc. You can't place a valuation on the Internet, but interestingly enough, you can with Bitcoin.
So in terms of Bitcoin's price and market cap, I believe they'll be lagging indicators of the time and capital investments taking place now. I'm super bullish on Bitcoin.

My landlord in Shanghai charges me way too much rent for a 1 bedroom apartment ($4000 / month). It's the market price, and I signed the lease. 
If I were more than 1 month late on my payment, I'm certain my government connected landlord would take all my stuff and kick me out. 
If I forged his signature and created a new contract, I'm certain I'd end up in a ditch, no question about it.
Yes, Chinese business culture is different, but a country doesn't become a top economy without enforceable contracts.

How is this different from [Mason Eyewear]( They've been accepting bitcoin for a while now. I bought them a while ago for $95 fitted with a prescription. Tens looks like a more expensive version with lower quality.

That sucks. For everyone reading this post, I recommend CoPay or Bread for iOS.

We've seen this tape with major retailer hype before. Even if AirBnB accepts bitcoin:
* AirBnB will only get a small, short-term bump (we're still a small community that likes to HODL)
* 3 months later, AirBnB will realize a bitcoin logo at checkout will increase shopping cart abandonment and won't be worth the negligibly lower transaction fee.
* It won't help price (every payment effectively becomes bitcoin sell)
Since AirBnB is a marketplace (unlike Expedia and Microsoft), they could implement a closed loop solution, and _that would be awesome!_ It'll make it easier for AirBnB to expand to countries like Cuba and encourage more hosts which they desperately need!

Will be interesting to see if they continue publishing. $24k * 365 is $8.7M annualized. Overstock's 2014 bitcoin sales was below [$3M](

You mention banks, IBM, and Samsung repeatedly - can you provide details on what they're doing with ethereum with sources?
I have friends who work at both IBM and Samsung, and I'm sure Bitcoin / blockchain / ethereum aren't serious priorities. If these companies staff &lt;12 on exploring these ideas, it doesn't mean much. The value is likely being perceived as cutting edge to shareholders and employees. 
When these companies invest $100m+ on a project, let me know. Else, it sounds like brand name vapor ware projects on top of an open source vapor ware project.

90% realize it's just entertainment. Retards believe fortunes will come true and assholes have the nerve to charge back as justification. Perfect Bitcoin use case. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:44:36
I used to run a merchant processor, and this is commonplace. I don't know this merchant's particular business, but high % of international transactions + high chargeback rate (3-5%) are considered red flags in credit card processing. Bitcoin is perfect for a merchant like them.
The riskiest business we assessed was a popular fortune teller. Her chargeback rate was close to 10%, and she was willing to pay 7-8% to process her cards. When fortunes don't come true, people charge back.

From my experience, their escrow ensures funds won't be lost until you get the product you want. I've had to wait a few times for delivery or deal with cancellations, but at lower discount rates (~14%), I've had no issues. Have you been scammed?
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:31:44
Because bitpay or coinbase accept bitcoins on behalf of merchants. Usually they deposit USD to merchants' bank accounts. BTC (if elected) goes to merchants' coinbase account or address specified to bitpay.

I tried to get my mom to use a real wallet and lost bitcoins &amp; time in the process.
Instructed her to download Bread. When I asked her to save the seed, she took a screenshot with Photo Stream turned on. So we had to start all over. Couldn't figure out how to setup a new wallet with Bread then switched to Mycelium. This time, she wrote down the seed. Sent her 0.1 BTC (~$50 at the time). Few months later, she lost her phone and the seed.
All told, trying to get my mom to use a real wallet cost me 2-3 hrs and 0.1 BTC. I believe people should hold their keys too, but if your mom uses a password like "Main1992" on every web service, just use Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-09-09 22:49:01
I do appreciate &amp; use CoPay but point taken.

Save on Amazon with Bitcoin. The marketplace turns [illiquid value]( to Bitcoin. Amazon gift card balances are essentially illiquid. So if you can bring liquidity to them, you can hypothetically translate it to discounts for Bitcoin holders. The blockchain enables that, and Purse proved it out.

Their fee is [1-14.4%]( Most of my orders were at 20% discount, so 1.9% fee. My orders &gt;35% discount never get taken, so I'm guessing they're making 1-5% per transaction.
