yeah im there already.. mainly because i didn't pay for anything, someone gifted me a bunch of bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum. if it drops to nothing, i still am in at nothing. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 23:44:04
cool, can i have a few of em?

hi, - do us all a favor, and fuck off.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:10:23
i don't have -any- bitcoins and you've got more than 2! surely you don't need both of them!
@_date: 2014-09-15 00:11:56

@_date: 2014-12-01 03:01:25

different reasons to do different things. if im standing on the corner trying to get home from the bar, im more likely to hail a cab.
@_date: 2014-11-02 04:16:42

@_date: 2014-06-12 13:41:46

people actually eat that shit?
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:24:19
yeah don’t worry, just like the stock market, they’ll send an email out so you can sell before it drops.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:50:47
if it were a good idea, everyone would be doing it already.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:43:00
i sold all but 1 eth just before it dipped. 
but i also sold .25 BTC because i need the money...also just before it dipped again... and sold most of my litecoin also before the big dip. kept a bit because i wanted to keep my toes in, but i got out at the right time for now. i'll pay off some debt and get back in.
