wikileaks would not have had those documents to release if not for Russian hackers in the first place... and trump's campaign was colluding with russia, so looks to me like there are still some dots to be connected.


 
trump's campaign was working with russian agents. Russian agents used wikileaks (which had a decent reputation at the time) as a tool for spreading their distractions and misinformation. wikileaks was compromised in a similar manner to the current administration.
bitcoin may have definitely helped... some... but i really don't think assange or wikileaks would help the incredibly wealthy russians for free. considering the price of bitcoin when they received it, there's a good chance they received more from russians than in Bitcoin.

...that's not how logic works but keep trying.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:51:11
certainly had nothing to do with russian interference, right?
even though we've found out wikileaks was working with russian agents? they're obviously not just leaking ANY information, they obviously had a reason to specifcally target hillary and the dnc.


 
i'm genuinely interested in the reasoning behind your statement.

government has SIGNIFICANTLY more 'usecases' than bitcoin though. it's like comparing metrorail cards to an entire corporation just because they both happen to use plastic cards for different purposes.
a government is neither a store of value nor a transactional system.

check the edit and actually address the discussion please.

...it was just the first link i found on a broken phone. sorry for not finding your personal favorite source, but care to offer any information to actually contradict this?
google "wikileaks gru" and you'll find a multiple corroborating sources.

whoa buddy, you're shoving like whole novels into my mouth.
what am i missing? don't blame me for your inability to explicate your own thoughts effectively lol. my point still stands; time and ability to shop around  is a luxury not afforded to many when it comes to medical needs, especially emergency services. profit-motives and competition have no more place in healthcare, in my opinion, than necessary societal infrastructure like water and emergency services. we tried private fire departments, that didn't go very well lol.
edit: also, being invested into crypto in no way precludes you from desiring effective government programs, right? either/or fallacy there? government's gonna be there one way or another...

yeeeah shopping around is a lot of fun when somebody is in need of emergency medical services lol. ambulance bills are usually what screw over most folks with whom i've discussed this. they may have needed something important but inexpensive and still get their credit ruined by the ride.
and when the system is an insurance-run racket, shop around all you want but i doubt you'd ever find anything close to what its actual cost is.

you can but i'd be surprised if you get an answer. if you do, lemme know too, i'm curious hahah.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:18:49
yeah i have no idea why this is getting upvotes except pure ego-padding. this is a completely arbitrary correlation to make. there's not even information to establish the correlation in the first place, just words to put the association in your mind. this is pretty silly and ridiculous that folks seem to want to give this legitimacy. this is nothing but irrelevent words applied to technical charts.
you can try to convince everyone as much as you're a big strong man and not a weak one... but it has nothing to do with these charts and the effort usually outs you as a subordinate anyway. strong men don't need memes to tell other folks their strong. they just get shit done lol.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:48:34
...yep, sounds like a completely broken system to me, in which not paying medical debt is seen as an effective way to receive treatment lol. but i know for a fact you're not alone in that!

yeah it's a joke from a show called my name is earl. he sees Carson Daly talking about karma on TV and thinks he invented the idea, everytime somebody mentions karma in the beginning, he asks that haha.
@_date: 2019-08-04 12:25:34
oh you a Carson Daly fan too?

how is it any moreso than driving a fancy car in general?
not like they'll expect to steal your private keys lol.

oh no shit lol. never seen it but looks like it's free to stream, maybe that'll finally happen tonight.

stealing crypto is not easier than stealing cash lol. dunno why the caveat of 'all of their wealth' is necessary. it's not really ever realistic to steal ALL of someone's wealth. if you have all of your crypto in ONE wallet, you already fucked up lol. they're not gonna shoot you if they don't get ALL of your money. they'll take what they can get and gtfo.

reddit-is-fun or joey as well
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:11:19
yeah wouldn't it be claimed just like any other income when sold for cash? which is basically the same for Crypto too, yeah?

journalism used to be so much more involved and exciting back in the day... rushing to the scene in time to get your scoop, absolutely no such thing as clickbait because it wasn't easy at first and ink wasn't free. the whole point was to be concise and succinct as possible, each word had to be effective... these days nobody cares about the quality of their work in general, let alone writing specifically. everybody's got their own soapbox in the pocket of their pants and everybody 'thinks' they're friends with all these folks they hardly know just because they're allowed frequent interaction with no effort at all. social media is  ruining human culture in general, the more i think about it. i had just thought about the dynamics of interpersonal relationship and how folks get the validation of having been a good friend just because they clicked one of those faces... shit like that and notifications in general are pretty much nothing more than dopamine buttons, and we've seen what happens to rats when they have access to a dopamine button, just like those studies with the buggers and acess to cocaine in a solution of water.*
gonna look for a source on this 'cause i'm real out of it and could e mistaken.
man i feel like i've just been ranting about random shit all now.

what? how's that we're in a multi-trillion dollar federal deficit in the us, while wage-gap grows and wealth further concentrates at the top? seems the opposite of what you describe.
thanks for that vocab word though, hadn't heard of that specific concept. am genuinely interested in your explanation.
