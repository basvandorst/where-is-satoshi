As someone who never posts in ANY crypto coin subreddits, you hit the nail on the head.


This is the main problem I have with it. You guys seem to act like the tech side of doing all this is sooo easy, while mocking anyone who is confused by it all. The whole scene is very intimidating and it is NOT welcoming to new-comers. Bitcoin will never get big, just look at the amount of subscribers you guys have, and its already mid 2014. It will never be the currency of the future, its too complicated. Sorry, go ahead and downvote me to oblivion, but this is how A LOT people feel as outsiders to all this.

The kid doesn't have anything, except a father who is so obsessed with publicity and bitcoin, that he created a "business" to further his own interests and make it look like his kid is a genius . Jeez Reddit is fucking gullible...
Do you seriously believe some random 9 year old just happened to have soo much interest in Bitcoin, he just thought- "hey I should start a business selling apple stock". No, of course not.

How? Because he has an overly-pushy father who is screaming everything bitcoin at his child 24/7 and forcing/writing a presentation for him to present? Ya, maybe not.
