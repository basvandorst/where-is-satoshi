Oh yes the Charities that take 90-95% of it for themselves for "Administrative fees" and the rest is lucky to get past the corrupt government officials of different countries and/or their militia groups. 
Meanwhile, Dogecoin helped send the Jamaican bob sled team to the Olympics, Helped provide clean water for Kenya, and tons and tons of other such things. And guess what? They got the full amount :O Thanks to hardly any fees or anything.

You never know, Hopefully people will even then :). Not all people will donate of course but I think the fact its based on a 'fun' meme it will be a little more open. I hope they will continue to donate to causes, even if its for press such as Nascar and Jamaican bob sled team. Maybe it will go to a dollar per, or 50 cents per or even a penny per. 
Also, You gotta admit - the picture of the Doge in the back is pretty bad ass to think people will be staring at a cryptocurrency the entire time :P. It will be good for all crypto's not just doge :D.

+25 doge verify
No need to be so rude, I didn't mean anything by it. Good for you for doing research :) That is the majority of the charities. And also, You acted as if they haven't done anything but sponsor a single Nascar driver - Which is untrue and I was informing you. They are honestly some of the most charitable people I've seen online - And I'm sure not all of them is pulling a good paycheck.
