I've been waiting for a response for over a week*. Just saying.
Edit: * Nearly 2 weeks, but the request status has now changed from "Waiting for my response" to "Being progressed". But I can't blame them; it's not their money that's at stake... oh, wait a minute... :(

Filly, you are absolutely spot on; *silkroadreloaded* attacks potential friends and foes alike. The impression that's given is of someone with bad judgement and lack of humor, who is easily distracted by irrelevancies. Many  of the rants make no sense at all unless *silkroadreloaded* is shilling for Agora or Evo, because they're certainly not doing SRR/SR3 any favors.

Not sure why I'm getting downvoted. Just doing a tldr, answering questions for those who seem to have missed the earlier link to the bitcointalk forum. (Russian, because the hacker states that English isn't their first language, and 90% of the hacker's forum posts are in Russian.)

It's a Russian(?) hacker who thinks BitCoin is not just flawed but is a scam (nothing more than a Ponzi scheme), and who enjoys exposing Bitcoin's vulnerabilities in order to attract paid hacking work.
