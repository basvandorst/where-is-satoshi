I'd say no. Most of the top 15 coins are pumping, including BCH. This is just your standard back-to-school altcoin pump. Monero has fallen quite a bit from 0.031 to 0.013, so a pump was inevitable.
Most people will indeed realize, that with Bitcoin, _the whole world_ can see how you're earning and spending your money, and every merchant can know your entire financial and commercial history once you send a payment or sign a message. Unfortunately, once the realization is in, it'll probably be too late.
(And yes, before you start asking, I think that Lightning Network cannot solve this problem. It requires users to open and close channels, and Bitcoin blockchain simply cannot support a mere 100M people opening and closing channel _once a year_, not to mention a population of a country like China or India. Only way to implement LN is to make big banks and financial institutions act as a channel liquidity provider, which is kind of exactly the same as Swish or similar fintech solutions for instant payments. And whenever you introduce KYC/AML laws, privacy is gone.)

ECD started implementing new KYC laws. After December 26th you have to verify yourself before being able to buy or sell crypto, even on ATMs. Nothing good lasts for long.
In 2-3 years, expect to receive a tax statement to your home address, in which you'd have to pay 15 - 20% CGT ("porez na ekstra-profit") on any crypto you've ever bought, or somehow prove to tax authorities that you lost your crypto coins. ;)
And LocalBitcoins.com implemented full KYC/AML compliance earlier this year, you can't buy or sell BTC in person without being registered first.
All fiat ramps are closing down, fast. Soon only possibility of buying crypto would be on black markets. After that all prices will be back to 2014 - 2015 levels, because usability will be the same. Whoever made profit, made profit, playing anarchy is over. As we say, ком опанци ком обојци. :D

There can be no widespread crypto adoption without a new type of countries. Every single country and government in existence is part of a same cabal, and they are all synchronized in their endeavors. Yes, I do mean that North Korea is governed by the same people as Switzerland or France. Their "upper bosses" belong to the same group.
Therefore we need a legally independent state. A nation floating in LEO, or sea-steading on international waters, or situated on a land bought cheaply from another (failed) state. 
Citizens of this new nation would need to renounce all their existing citizenships, to avoid extradition. Governance will be completely transparent. All officials would have to wear POV cams 24/7, and there would be no privacy for them. No secret meetings, no hidden agendas. Total democracy. Bitcoin and crypto coins would be only means of monetary exchange. Budget spending would also be completely transparent, thus there will be no corruption.
Without this, it doesn't matter where you live: Somalia, Silicon Valley, Mars, Vladivostok, Zürich, you're part of the same system. There is no escape. 
Unless a completely new nation is created: where all men are created equal and independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent and inalienable, among which are the preservation of life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Bitcoin implemented over PayPal is still Bitcoin. People still don't understand the main quality about BTC: it's scarcity. There will only be 18-19M Bitcoins in the world, ever. Whereas new USD is printed every day and sent to foreign countries to buy off their real goods and products and natural wealth and bring it home to America, then print another few billions. Until the world is saturated with trillions of worthless dollars which price is held only by sheer military force.

Traditional banking and governments will either own 90% of all cryptocurrencies, or will regulate them to oblivion. If you have to pay 50 - 70% annual CGT on all gains that your crypto retirement fund made, then what's the point in keeping Bitcoin as a store of value, when the government will rob you of your money legally, and there's nothing you can do can stop it.
This is the key fact that you're missing: _we all live in countries_. There's no possible way of living your life outside of a country, outside the reach of the global legal and monetary system.
In ancient and medieval times, people could decide to move out of cities, and spend their life on no man's land, in a forest which _no one_ owned, at a sea which no king, emperor, or president had claimed their ownership.
Good luck living outside the grid today. Sure, you can take a trailer or a yacht and be self-sufficient, but you're still a ~~servant~~ citizen of some country. You're still living on _someone's_ land, bound by _someone's_ law, and are kept alive by the mercy of some king or emperor. They might be called marshals, presidents or prime ministers, but they're actual kings of their domain. Every human being that exists on this planet is a subject of their king.
You can say, "but I can purchase land in Canada, or US, or Russia, and it'll be my land, mine alone." But that's an illusion. Try being a citizen of Iran and then try to purchase land in California. Or the opposite. No, every "ownership" of land, property, or fiat you have, is a mere _lease_. You cannot own anything in a legal system. Anything you "own" is just your king giving you a 10, 20, 100 year, or life-long lease on something.
Think I'm joking? What about funds confiscation? What about civil forfeiture? What about imprisoning people, stripping them of all property and keeping them in a dungeon for _years_ without a clear reason?
When the first human baby is born that's inhabitant of no country, servant of no king, bound by no country's law, then and _only then_ can we say that we've ascended as a species and truly free.

But that's easy. Any BTC address that had ever been posted on any terrorist site or chatroom will be regarded "black" and any address sending Bitcoins to black addresses are regarded as owned by criminals. Likewise, any UTXO originating from a "black" address is to be seized at any KYC/AML point, be it a bank or an exchange.
Sure, you can receive ISIS Bitcoins, but good luck converting them to fiat. Out of courtesy, you can replace ISIS with TPB, Wikileaks, Ed Snowden, Communist Party of America, NAMBLA, or any organization or individual of your choice.

Few years later, Bitcoin is no longer a tool to enhance privacy, but a superb tracking mechanism.
- Every major exchange has KYC/AML; your bank accounts get frozen if you buy coins; there's no simple and easy way to buy Bitcoin with fiat
- Every BTC transaction is completely traceable, and mixers don't help much (other than painting your supposedly clean laundry into a shade gray)
- Chain analysis services are being developed

**Bitcoin isn't fungible**, it only provides a small degree of pseudoanonymity.
If you received 0.5 BTC that are known to be originating from a Silk Road drug trader, or which were at some time owned by ISIS, you'll have a hard time spending them. No exchange would want to deal with blacklisted coins. Furthermore, sending blacklisted coins to a KYC/AML exchange would mean involvement of LE; you'd have to explain where you got your Bitcoins from. Worst case scenario: your coins will be forfeited by the police or IRS.
Once Bitcoin becomes a global currency, it's complete traceability will be perfect means of mass human enslavement.
Very few crypto currencies have functional fungibility (Monero and few of it's code forks), and it's sad that no one understands the importance of it.

They can try this only once per exploit. What doesn't kill Bitcoin's blockchain, only makes it stronger. 
Once double-spending begins, Bitcoin developers would fix the exploit, fork the chain from a previous checkpoint (e.g. 1 week before the exploit was first used), and nothing of value is lost.
If Bitcoin developers don't want to fix the exploit, some other developers would. Bitcoin is an idea, and _ideas are bulletproof_.

Analysis is possible if:
- xmr.to operators are keeping IP address logs and BTC transfers. LE could send them a subpoena with a gag order to reveal these records. Right now, xmr.to keeps records only for the last 3 days, but we can never fully verify. This can be mitigated by accessing xmr.to from a trusted VPN or Tor network; that way you do not have to worry about IP logs.
- xmr.to servers are compromised by a high-grade agency which had installed a rootkit or a RAT to their servers in order to monitor all IP addresses and transfers and log them to a remote database. This can also be mitigated by accessing xmr.to from a trusted VPN or Tor.
- You use xmr.to from a compromised computer which has spy malware installed. This can be mitigated by accessing xmr.to from a computer that's booting live Linux (leaving no traces), and by keeping your Moneroj on a separete airgapped machine or hardware wallet.
- Quantum computers are used to break all 3 layers of Monero cryptography. That's still decades or maybe centuries away (at least based on the data available to general public).

Blockchain is crippled with 1 MB blocks. You can't use Lightning if you don't have Bitcoin on-chain, and because you can't mine it, you can only buy it safely on a KYC/AML exchange (gov't has your name and address and amount, how's that private?). You can't open a Lightning channel if the chain is clogged and only 6 persons per second AT MOST can open or close a channel (6 tps).

What comes next is the presidential elections in the US, fall of 2020. There are three paths of action, ending in a same event.
1. Trump wins popular vote, but loses on the electoral college. He calls for a vote theft, a conspiracy by the "deep state". As he's still the president in power, he will start a massive erosion of US institutions behind the curtain, endless vote recounts, subversive media action, ending up in a constitutional coup. Presidential elections are repeated, this time Trump wins, making himself a life-long dictator of the newly created US Empire.
2. Trump loses popular vote and admits defeat, but tweets that the world haven't seen the last of him. Everything seems calm for a few days. But then his massive army of brainwashed frogmen incels start gathering into local armed militias who start getting into clashes with leftists and the law enforcement. In more than half cases police is on the militia side, and starts following orders from Emperor Trump. Chain of command is overridden: Trump directly commands his minions' actions through internet mass media such as Twitter. Emperor declares a martial law on entire US soil, and during the interregnum, makes himself a life-long dictator of the newly created US Empire.
3. Trump wins the 2020 elections, changes the constitution, and makes himself a life-long dictator of the newly created US Empire.
So what happens next? You guessed it - BRICS countries form a loose federation that declares war on the US Empire and it's fascist regime. A new world war lasts for 2 to 3 years, ending with a few controlled EMP bombs going off in major cities. World economy and trust in the US and democracy in general is ruined for the next half century. Cryptocurrencies are forgotten. United Nations declare Chinese Yuan as the new world reserve currency. Iran annexes most of Arabian peninsula. Russia and it's allies strengthen ties with European countries as there are no more US-enforced sanctions.

Yes but you cannot transact 1 satoshi on-chain. Average tx fee that gets your payment in next block is about 10 sat/byte which makes about 2500 Satoshi the minimal amount you can send to anyone. If BTC is 1M$, then minimal transaction is about 20 - 25$, IF there is free space on the block.

I hope he's right. If BTC goes to $1M, and it turns out you cannot buy less than $5000 worth of Bitcoin (because of exchange fees and dust limit), then at least 60% of the world wouldn't be able to buy any amount of Bitcoin. This is an unsolved technical problem. Poor people would have to live with paper fiat that's "anchored" to BTC. A whole new class of aristocracy would emerge. We'll have a new French revolution, or Citadels and extreme poverty as that time traveller dude said.

Yes, it's a good X-ray scan of the cryptoscene.
Fiat ramps are the main and unsolvable problem in crypto adoption. Without an easy way of buying coins for fiat, or earning them though labor, Bitcoin is just a ponzi scheme.
Even the lead devs (Greg, Luke, Adam...) are advocating the use of fiat and credit cards over BTC.

How are KYC regulations going to be removed? Impossible, that's a one-way trip. It's more likely that Saudi Arabia will allow gay marriages and recreational use of cocaine, then any government in the world loosening regulation of Bitcoin and AML laws.
People bought Bitcoins for $30 - $50, and today I can't hope to ever have 0.1 BTC even if I dollar cost average a substantial amount of my (3rd world country) monthly wage for YEARS.  By the time Lightning is out of beta and implemented in most exchanges, 1 BTC will be over $100k. Such explosive price growth cannot be natural. A tipping point will be reached at some point, and then the price would simply crumble to a natural bottom, defined by actual use.
@_date: 2018-10-21 11:32:41
The difference between 2018 and 2011-2016 is that back in these good old days, very few exchanges required KYC/AML. Bitcoin was truly a money of the people. It was under the radar. You could mine it yourself.
In 2017-2018, big money entered crypto, and made sure to make it a rich guys country club. Regular folks have to provide their full details and identities in order to buy, or risk their life in back alley face to face deals. Adoption doesn't work that way. The gatekeepers have closed the gates. 
Also don't forget that mining has become super expensive (due to ASICs) and available only to selected few companies and individuals who are able to invest millions of dollars into equipment. Bitcoin is now a centralized, small-world network.
And no, 2nd layer solutions just aren't practical for the "unbanked". You cannot open a LN channel if you have no BTC. You cannot receive BTC without previously having some, and to be able to buy some you have to leave a selfie of yourself holding your ID card and smiling. "Here's my face, my name and address, I want to undermine the world financial system." What kind of divine mockery is that? Even Joker from the Batman couldn't think of a better way to destroy Bitcoin.

Exactly how "terrorism" paved a way for mass surveillance, increased authority of various "national security" agencies, and social networks that keep us trapped in our own bubbles.
People still can't imagine how bad they were played with Bitcoin. It paved a way for a centralized FEDcoin to emerge, eliminate paper cash, and complete our enslavement. They're already doing an experiment down in Venezuela. The experiment in India (withdrawing denominations and mass-marking of people) has already proved to be successful. And the results of the Serbian experiment (populist autocracy government that's impossible to be brought down) played out in America with the Trump presidency.

Blocks wouldn't have to be 1GB immediately. They'd grow slowly, limited by miners' capacity and the speed of network links. Like, 1.2 MB in 2019, 2 MB in 2020, 4 MB in 2025... 
A miner who'd mine a 1GB or 50MB block the very first day would soon find his chain orphaned and his PoW wasted. Slow growth of blocksize would allow miners to update their connections, as technological growth allows.

PoW transmutes electricity into a fundamentally valueless but still extremely volatile digital set of signatures that's entirely dependent on the indefinite continuation of that same PoW.
When you think about it, Bitcoin looks like more as some kind of life form, than an inanimate asset like gold or crude oil. While gold requires no energy to maintain, and can remain completely stable and mostly indestructible for _billions of years_, Bitcoin requires constant energy intake to survive. Bitcoin cannot happen without it's constant, extremely competitive mining operations. This is why I think Bitcoin is a very energy inefficient monetary system.
Until cold fusion or zero-point energy harvesting systems are developed, Bitcoin and the greed that follows it, is just going to fasten the pace our non-renewable planetary resources are consumed. In that sense we can call Bitcoin as one huge [paperclip maximizer]( without any solid purpose other than it's own.

1. Sidechains, Lightning, etc: coins on sidechains and Lightning aren't actually Bitcoin. Bitcoin is UTXOs on main chain address where you control the keys. If main chain fees are $100 - $1000, it's impossible for regular people to use it. Thus sidechains and super-fast settlement networks become new fiat to Bitcoin's main chain gold. A disguised fractional reserve banking, and we're back to 2008 again.
2. Implementing on-chain privacy would require a hard fork. Partial privacy (similar to Zcash or Dash) would mean a severe break of fungibility. Any transaction you send or receive with a stealth address would turn on an alarm with the IRS or LE, and you will be investigated.
'Tis the best FUD I could come up with!
Now, what would I do if I was in charge of BTC development?
1. Implement 1GB block size limit immediately. Let miners mine whatever blocksize they're comfortable with. Result? Bitcoin Cash = obsolete and eliminated. Litecoin, Dogecoin, the rest of clones = redundant and eliminated. Anyone can use Bitcoin. No more congestion. No more high fees. Anyone can open and close Lightning channels both today and in 10 years without overpaying for fees.
2. Big blocks allow implementing a protocol for efficient and fully private coin mixing. Monero, Zcash, the rest of private coins = redundant and eliminated.

Is it more likely that in 25 years the whole world adopts Bitcoin as store of value, or that the world is annihilated in a nuclear war?
No sane government or central bank would allow a permissionless currency to gain adoption. There's simply no way Bitcoin is ever going to be anything more than a darknet token, and this is one of the few things that all bankers, politicians, and generals in the world would agree to.
We have maybe 3 or 5 more years of building castles in the sand, before our parents take us home. I reckon there'll be one more bullrun after the halving, and that's everyone's chance to get out with some profits and buy themselves a little better life than the rest. After that, around 2023 - 2024 the curtain falls. There are 2 possible roads to demise: 
- Crypto gets regulated to death. Every single transaction must be thoroughly documented under KYC/AML laws. Individuals holding undocumented assets are facing decades of incarceration, and any private key discovered by LE is immediately confiscated on the spot.
- Cashless society takes root. Countries start removing physical paper bills from circulation, similar to how FDR outlawed gold in 1933. People hand over their cash and get electronic fiat in return. Interest in Bitcoin drops because now it's possible to send USD or EUR over the internet as easy as it was sending Bitcoin. In a few years Bitcoin is forgotten as overcomplicated, redundant, and energy inefficient. Cryptocoins become a novelty item, an expensive computer history thing for rich collectors.

Sure, all the dollar bills have cocaine and who knows what on them, and they have serial numbers too. But they're easy to shuffle around, and unlike Bitcoin, aren't tracked 24/7 by any interested party.

It's Bitcoin that passed through an address that's announced to be owned by a criminal individual or enterprise. e.g. coins that originated from a darknet market's hot wallet, or were proven to be previously owned by an individual arrested for serious crimes.
Bitcoin blockchain is fully transparent. Everyone knows the exact history of every single satoshi, right from the moment it's mined. As soon as you deposit tainted coins on a KYC exchange (e.g. Coinbase), expect your balance to be frozen, money seized, and you'd be questioned by the police to explain how you got your coins and from whom.
Blockchain transparency allows your merchant (e.g. coffee shop) to know how much money you have left in your hot wallet, so they offer you more products (because they know you can pay for it). Would you want for anyone to be able to look inside your wallet? Blockchain transparency allows anyone who has access to exchange's identity database (hackers or governments for example) to track your spending and earning. No way to hide from tax authorities.
In a way, it's way worse than regular banking.

Finally some sober reasoning! Collective salvation is impossible, and only realistic "way out" is individual financial independence.
Bitcoin (and most other cryptocurrencies) was a successful experiment, but for the most part it remained nothing other than that. It brought nothing truly substantial to the world other than a new class of short-term speculative assets. Without the heavy price speculation (even manipulation) coins would remain a purely academic endeavor.

(1) Some didn't agree with a protocol change, and now we have BCH-ABC and BCH-SV. Every time there's a non-agreement, we have a fork and a chain split. Basically free money if you don't want to keep the other side's coins.
(1a) Bitcoin does have it's own inflation due to mining. It's about 1-2% annually and slowly drops because of halving. It still remains to be seen if there will be any mining incentive once block reward drops to below 0.5 BTC.
(1b) Due to coin taint, imposed by our all-powerful law enforcement, you will always have UTXOs that are worth _less_ than others. Fungibility is a lost dream with Bitcoin the way it is now.
(2) It's divisibility depends on network fees, which constantly change. Theoretically, even if fees are 1 sat/byte, it's impossible to send less than about 200 satoshis, so that's your minimal division. Two and a half decimal places lost right at the start. As usage grows, there's more and more pressure on the tiny 1MB blocks, therefore fees skyrocket. It's impossible to put world population in an elevator, the waiting line will span across the globe. You will have only 2 - 3 effective decimal places; everything below will be eaten up by fees. Would you pay $1000 to open and close a Lightning channel? I know I wouldn't. That's not how I imagined digital money to work.
(3) Yes. I write an email to my financial manager, saying to relay payment according to invoice 12345 XYZ. They connect with their bank which supports international RTGS, and transmit $1M to the receiver in Japan, who's bank also supports international RTGS payments.
(3a) Yes. I login to my PayPal account, paste email address of the recipient, and send that $50 away, instantly. I don't even have to pay any fees.
(3b) Yes. I open Venmo, WeChat, or Swish if I'm in Sweden, and send that $50 of fiat, instantly, with zero fees.
(4) Then why only 0.0001% of all employed people in the world get their wages in Bitcoin? Maybe because using Bitcoin is a legal nightmare for any company, so there's absolutely no incentive to use it.
And betting on something is still speculation, no?

I have never seen a cryptocoin that's stable. If that was the case, we wouldn't be obsessed with bear/bull markets, pumps/dumps, or constantly convert BTC value to USD. 
Imagine you're a farmer, selling sheep. Would you sell your sheep for a fixed price of 0.1 BTC each, would you update the sheep BTC price _every hour_, or would you simply set the price to "$400/ewe, paid in Bitcoins"?


The very fact that I'm involved with cryptocurrencies and have learned how they operate on the technical level, shows that I have an open mind. My current impression that I've been wrong and/or deluded all these years only reinforces that notion.


Reality is my empirical support. Or perhaps I do not see the same world as you do?

There are services for that, but right now only FBI-level investigations can afford them. In a few years I expect it'll be cheap enough that individual merchants would be required to have this kind of check before validating payments.


There will be set a value threshold, say, $1 - $10, below which on-chain transactions wouldn't be regarded interesting. But if you received, like, more than $50 from a tainted address, red light would turn on somewhere.

I'd really like to know what exactly was fixed in Bitcoin, so that it's no longer a first-generation crypto.
We still have to run a full node if we want to be safe or use Lightning. We still have to be wary of chain congestion and $50 tx fees. We still have to worry about receiving tainted coins. We still have to pay CGT on crypto gains. We cannot open an LN channel if we don't pay on-chain tx fees. Channels are still unstable and your balance can always disappear in a poof of magic.
So what's changed? Nothing. Bitcoin is a gen-1 crypto still. It's a cloud-connected Ford Model T in a world of Tesla Roadsters.

I said Bitcoin was an _asset_, and I'm comparing it to gold, which is the second best asset that can be used as currency so far. Both have flaws.
Bitcoin is super easy to transact in a connected world, you can send 10000 kg worth of gold nearly instantly using Bitcoin, while paying a merely $1 fee. Gold cannot be destroyed, it will survive any downfall of civilization, but good luck transporting 10000 kg of gold from place A to place B.

I'd assume there's a much higher probability of criminal users on any private and anonymous service, than in places where you have to expose your full identity. A tainted UTXO is still tainting everything it goes through, making anything originating from DEX's escrow addresses potentially tainted. 
I'm not saying it's too easy to end up in jail just for the possession of tainted coins. But it can and probably would become much worse in the coming years. Everywhere around the world, openly fascist and Neo-Nazi forces are taking over governments. First thing which usually goes away is financial freedom and free media, because everything else depends on that.

When I see Ledger or Trezor selling a device which:
- you put on your roof and forget it exists
- it's a satellite antenna with 2 big solar panels so it works outside the grid
- "fire and forget" servo tracking mechanism so it automatically adjusts antenna position based on GPS data and time of day
- behind the antenna there's a small weather-proof PC with a 2TB SSD where blockchain is stored
- each device comes with some small uplink capability, so it's possible to broadcast txes to satellite network
- the device creates a local WiFi network to which your phone can connect to, and sync with the blockchain and mempool
- everyone from your village can sync the blockchain and send txes
- literally unstoppable Bitcoin network, powered by infinite fusion engine (the Sun)
...I'll know Bitcoin has some chance of adoption. For additional jamming resistance, instead of satellite links wait until transceivers with clusters of entangled photons are available, so you don't need radiowaves anymore.

Isn't that the easiest way to get tainted BTC?
If you really want to use Bitcoin anonymously, store your wealth in Monero, and use xmr.to to send BTC payments. Xmr.to automatically and seamlessly converts your XMR to BTC and sends them to the receiving address you specified. 
This has two advantages:
- Receiver gets money from Xmr.to and doesn't know how much money you have. Chain analasys next to impossible.
- Xmr.to service only gets your Monero, which is completely private blockchain, so the service doesn't know your address or how much money you have, or where you got it from

But what makes something a currency and not an asset class? I think it's the stability and widespread use, and Bitcoin is neither stable nor so widespread to be a currency. 
My main thought experiment is this: if you remove all the speculators and hodlers (which don't treat Bitcoin like a currency), what happens? I suppose Bitcoin would drop to about 2000 - 10000 transactions per day, and the price would be in $100 - $200 range.

Non-mining nodes have no say in the consensus. These do not secure the network, only the mining nodes do. It's like having a voting seat in the United Nations, compared to being a non-voting observer.
There are coins which are ASIC resistant and allow solo mining only (Nerva for example), where your home computer can join the network and be equal with a server in a datacenter (1 CPU = 1 vote). Bitcoin, with it's 200 GWh daily consumption is destined for centralization, because it can be mined with expensive professional equipment only. It's a big business club. Just like you said, miners are partnering with cloud providers, only caring about ROI. That's Bitcoin (BTC) today.

Bought at $10k, now my Bitcoins are effectively unspendable for about 3 - 5 years. If Bitcoin is $2500 next month, then paying a $100 item with my Bitcoins would actually mean I'll be paying $400 for the same item. Crazy, right?
Someone said stablecoins are the future, I could agree to a point. Bitcoin is nothing more than gold or platinum. It's an asset that's easy to transport and keep, but is extremely vulnerable to nuclear war and Internet disruption. Only stablecoins tethered to "stable" currencies such as USD or EUR can be actually used as _currency_. Saying otherwise is just closing your eyes to truth.
And that's why we have bubbles in crypto. For every ATH there's army of people who devoted their existence in getting their revenge for buying at previous ATH. Guys who bought BTC at $1500 in 2014 are the same ones who dumped it in January and February 2018. As more and more people get burned, you have less and less new ones interested in it. And slowly it all goes downhill.
You could say, with usage, Bitcoin's price would stabilize. I'd say no. It will forever stay a speculative asset, reaching a plateau at about $100k - $150k somewhere around 2025 - 2030, then it'll be forgotten as new technologies replace it. 
You could say, but USD lost 99.9% of it's value since 1910. That's true, but it took USD about 100 years to accomplish that. It took Bitcoin **bloody 8 months** to lose 85% of it's value and no signs of recovery yet. How's that for a currency? Far worse than Turkish Lira.
You _need_ institutions, central banks, _big guns_ if you will, to provide stability to an asset and make it a currency. Behind United States Dollar there's a country with a 240+ years old constitution (regardless of who's running the FED). Behind Bitcoin there's only whales, speculators, scammers, Lambo idiots, and people bitching because they bought it too late.

Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's an asset, like cooper or leopard skins. It has it's certain qualities, and that's it. Banks have no desire in stabilizing the price of cooper because it's not a currency.

1. You buy BTC in the street, pay with cash, completely OTC. They're deposited on your cold wallet generated on an airgapped machine. As far as LE is concerned, it looks like the previous owner of these coins just moved them to a new address, and you're not suspected.
2. Years pass. Bitcoin raises in price. Enough hodling, it's time to spend the coins. You sweep the cold wallet and move 5% of that money to a hot wallet in your phone. Send the rest to a brand new cold wallet. LE sees that the previous owner sent the coins to yet another address, but that a small amount went to other address. You were smart enough to broadcast that transaction from a shielded connection, so your IP address can't be linked with the transfer.
3. You buy a new laptop with some coins on your phone's hot wallet. Unfortunately, tainted coins bounce in the computer store, the merchant says something's wrong with your Bitcoins. You're pissed because the merchant kept the tainted coins ("until some background checks are done"), but your face and ID gets recorded.
4. Now LE knows that you are the owner of these coins, probably from the time since 5% of those coins were moved to a hot wallet. They are not sure for the remaining 95%. To them it looks like you bought 5% of what you actually own.
5. You say goodbye to civil-forfeited coins, pay a fine on 5% of your coins for buying them OTC and not paying taxes on them, and by some blind luck escape 30-day jail time for trying to transact with assets of criminal origin. What happens now? What will you do? Will you just sell the remaining 95% of your BTC stash in the street, same way like you got it, or will you try to "clean" it with a mixer who basically taints them some more for a 10% fee?

Already running a full node for another coin. I think there's no point in running a full BTC node, there's a lot of them already, and my holdings aren't that high to need that much security. Another reason is that if Bitcoin is going to continue in the current form factor (1MB blocks for the indefinite future), then only rich people and corporations would be able to afford on-chain txes as a settlement layer, so why bother _my_ equipment and _my_ HDD space and bandwidth in helping those who have 100x or 1000x more money than me. A Lightning node connecting to a remote full node is more than enough, and I've thought of setting it up sometime in the future.
ASIC equipment is simply too expensive and becomes obsolete quickly. Mining is a big money game for companies and (maybe one day) governments.

What if governments don't need money to fund wars? In times of Soviet Union workers in military factories and research centers didn't need money as everything was provided by the state. China or United States can declare that they're closing down their borders _tomorrow_ and after several years of crisis it would turn out they can be completely self sufficient.
You don't essentially need free trade or Bitcoin to make aircraft carriers, nuclear warheads, or keep people happy. See North Korea. Their people don't need money at all, and their society is completely self sufficient and can go on for centuries, unchanged. I'm sorry to say that the fate of North Korea or the Balkans is destined for the whole world, because it's a formula that works with the least effort. One part fear, other part populism and brainwashing people into whatever narrative is fashionable at the time. Places that are leaning towards authoritarianism will get their Kim Jong Uns, and other places which lean towards democracy and liberty will get their amplified version of Trump.
Above a certain level of power, only deep connections or membership in secret societies helps you to move an idea forward. And the world isn't run by money, but by these inaccessible higher echelons of power who make and break ideas and empires.

Not to the debt collectors. Remember how Argentinian debt was traded around by Wall St? Or was it Venezuelan? Doesn't matter. They come to your borders and demand 20% of your best territory as compensation, or they'll bomb your capital city. They don't even need nukes.
Think of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi. Now imagine the same thing, but with countries. Armenian genocide or the Holocaust was a video game tutorial compared to what awaits us in a few decades.

I was slowly buying pessimism all throughout 2018. I've got no cash left to spare, and a bag full of pessimism. Wait, I think the pessimism had died in the bag. Now it's just depression. An inflated, rotting depressed corpse that I paid big money.
Now you're telling me I have to wait 1 or 2 years for this depression to fully decompose? And 2 more years for bones to be cleaned by ants? And that there will be fools who'll buy these dry bones higher than what I paid for the fresh pessimism?
Fools indeed. Me included.

I tend to disagree. There are lots of humans in this world, and none of us will be missed as much as we'd like to think. 3-6 months tops. And what kind of depraved life would you have to endure for years after the torture? Would the medical bill put you and your family in debt for life? Would it be simply better to succumb to injuries and let your loved ones claim your insurance?

Humans can be mass produced in cloning vats, per demand. For example: Imperial Stormtroopers.
Or AIs can build humanoid robots that do all the things that a human can, plus they can survive in harsh environments, in open space, etc.

Hodl until 2030 when Bitcoin is worth $1 because no one uses that over-regulated coin for anything.
Pay $0.99 in taxes, cash out $0.01.
Now you have $0.01. Sum gud profits! If you can't afford to pay $0.99 in taxes, then what are you doing with your life.

This is all nice and sweet, but in order to receive 50 or 100 satoshi, one needs to have an open channel with some BTC in there.
A poor farmer in India who only has his phone and zero Bitcoins, cannot receive a 10 satoshi tip via Lightning. Impossible.

Hmm, that's an interesting observation.
You had a big country (Bitcoin), with a big army to defend it (ASIC miners), but becoming a citizen (BTC price) and paying taxes (tx fees) has become too expensive, so people started leaving. Economy crumbles.
Now you have the same big country, but 10% of it's standing army is sent home (offline miners). When 90% of that army is sent home without a wage, will it start robbing and plundering it's people? You ask the most amazing questions!


How can you stop the price falling? A single whale tops thousand individual hodlers. And if everyone are hodling in cold storage, then there's very little Bitcoin in circulation, so the price can be manipulated easily. What's Bitcoin price, actually? It's what's decided on exchanges, not what hodlers want.
If Bitcoin can be destroyed by sheer hashrate (which can be purchased by anyone with enough money), then it should change it's mining algo or implement another system to protect the network. Without users and adoption in trade there can be no cryptocurrency. Last thing users want is to have their money held hostage by miners.

What about someone's life savings indexed in Bitcoin, dropping 70% in _just one year_ because some whales wanted to play a game?

Now you only have to wait for 2040 when the network shuts down and Bitcoins are traded as novelty antiquity items for $2000 - $3000 each, and get out with only 40% - 50% losses. ;)

Countries with poor economies will suffer, some will crumble to anarchy and will be eaten by neighbors or global corporations. 
But that won't be the case with powerful countries, especially those who can afford nuclear weapons. Nukes are the two revolvers that you put on the table to end any poker game in your favor. Your country's money has devalued? 4X is the answer = Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate. You have a huge foreign debt? It will be erased, or we'll nuke your capital. Big fishes eating smaller ones. And we the people are ~~the smallest of smallest fishes~~ plankton.
What can Bitcoin do against ten aircraft carriers and seven nuclear submarines?
Okay, here's a more simpler dilemma. What will American people do when faced with a choice: economic downfall followed by a likely civil war, _or_, invading Mexico and getting hold of all their natural resources (because it's American by right of might)? I'm totally sure what will happen. So much land and resources going to waste in Central and South America. Who cares if some people die? Economy is important, yet shareholders are more important than economy.

**The Dream**
Back in 2014 I realized that Bitcoin and crypto in general was offering something that has never existed before, a totally new form of money with it's own special system. I thought it was the proper change that the world needed, that it could spark a revolution in the global economy and at least somewhat decrease paralyzing inequality. 
I remembered how my country in 2011 was one of the only 3 rare shitholes which didn't allow PayPal so I couldn't buy anything online. Bitcoin was permissionless, which by itself was super amazing. It was like BitTorrent but in reverse: torrents are an unstoppable abundance, BTC is an unstoppable scarcity. 
Sadly, as PayPal didn't work, nor there were any local exchanges, there was no way for me to buy BTC.
**The Miner**
So I setup myself a mining rig, mined some Dogecoins because they could still be mined with a GPU back then. It was just for fun. Somewhere in late 2014 it was becoming unprofitable to mine because Scrypt ASICs became a big thing, and I stopped believing that Bitcoin will ever be a thing: it would either be regulated to death, or fundamentally broken by NSA. Or simply there would be no real need for Bitcoins, because everyone will have PayPal and credit cards, every country will become civilized.
**The Idiot**
Fast forward to late 2017: my Dogecoins are now worth 10x more in fiat. Still no more than $100, though. I see an upward swing, got interested in trading because it required no money input. It was like magic (actually like sports betting), so I nearly doubled my Dogecoins. I wanted to buy more crypto so that I could trade some more. 
In the meantime, my country joined the world system. PayPal was accessible, credit cards started working internationally. I started buying tiny parts of Bitcoin. Sadly, at least half of my holdings today are bought at $10k. Idiot, idiot. Hindsight is 20/20. I should've accumulated in 2015 or 2016 when there was no price movement at all. Never buy at bullruns. Idiot. Idiot!
**The Trader**
So 2018 comes. The big downfall. I started trading with the Bitcoins I have, and so while you trade you normally read up on the assets you're trading. I made some nice gains but nothing spectacular. 5% here, 10% there. Almost laughable. Most of those were made riding XMR and BCH waves. Sadly I missed all Doge waves, which would've made me a fortune.
Comes the spring of 2018. I had some free money to spare that I'd waste on vacation or other dumb things otherwise. So I averaged in all these months, and the biggest mistake was that I averaged on an altcoin I totally believed in.
**The Bagholder**
\*sigh\* Yes. I still believe Monero is better than Bitcoin, offers better on-chain scaling, and full-on fungibility. But as with all things that you believe in, those things usually do not believe back in you.
**The Tinfoil Hat**
I was looking for a reason why Bitcoin has failed so miserably as a store of value, and why Monero has went so down. Without finding a reasonable answer, I turned to making a patchwork of believable theories as to why things happen the way they do. I still think now, as in late 2014, that Bitcoin will never be allowed to become a world currency, simply because it's too disruptive. But I hope there would be at least one big pump around 2021 halving. I don't ask much: just make it go to $10k again so I can have my vacation money back. I won't make the same mistake as before, and stop averaging in with extra spare money once the bears have finally done their work, so that could even make me some small money.
**The Hodler**
Though the exact vessel that'll keep this fiat multiplying until 2021 is still not as clear as it was in mid 2018. Should I keep it in Monero as I did before, or have at least a fraction in BTC? What about BCH? Diversification can't hurt, but too much of it spreads profits.
(Like you ever made any profits on Bitcoin, you idiot.)
So there you have it.

I wasn't expecting to become rich within a year, just feared Bitcoin would become too expensive and outside of my price range. It was a clear FOMO. But definitely I didn't expect for it to do down to $3000, back in late 2017.
And I'm not _that_ stupid to go all in of course. I got an untouchable emergency fund, no debts, no mortgages, stable roof over my head, and can survive and keep my family safe a few months without any income.
Right now I have no big utility for Bitcoin. Don't need anything from darknets, whatever I need I can buy using fiat or a card, nor I can imagine what I'd use Bitcoin for, locally. And I absolutely do not want to spent my coins because then I'd realize losses (as all prices are indexed in fiat). Maybe as gifts to friends, so it's pretty much like gold.
