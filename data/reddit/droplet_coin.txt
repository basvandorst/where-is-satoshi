This is getting ridiculous, if I buy Bitcoin on Bittrex and transfer it to Coinone and sell it for bitcoincash and back to bittrex. I will earn 10%(-transfer fees)!? Im doing it right now, the exchanges are not in sync.

Super Bitcoin (futures) is worth 320 dollars!? 
And I thought bitcoingold was way to high. These bitcoin forks needs to stop

Bitcoin is catching up to porn on google search stats: 
EDIT: Clearly China is focused on the important stuff while the rest of the world jerks off haha fun to see.

Oh okay, Thats a bit far, I live in Norway.
How nice, yeah im not a fan of lightbulbs as there is lightbulbs that doesnt wear out, but it is not as much money to earn if they make lightbulbs that last forever (so much resources wasted for money). Gooduck with your company, nice ideology :)

Can't wait for sells, Bitcoin is great, but Ethereum and Neo is fantastic. Bitcoin is less complicated, neo and ethereum is like microsoft and bitcoin is apple. There is room for both and they both have different strategies.

So you think Bithumb BitcoinCash trading down time 24 hours after ATH was planned? It might have been, but the koreans where clearly trying to flip.

Lovely, the world is falling apart because industries went away from this ideology, great to see you bringing back the good old days. Im using my fathers desk which my father before him used aswell, it is still in perfect condition!

There is a lot of fake posts atm, so sorry for my doubt. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:42:42
maybe the thousands of transactions that are stuck? Transaction fees?

The reason I belive in Neo is because China will use it to regulate ico's/chinese ico's will launch from Neo.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:13:30
Whats the company name? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:40:06
Yeah, so much fake stuff. Nice work btw, which country do you make these? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:52:15
lol why? I sold bitcoincash yesterday, earned nice profit on alts. Buying back in soon

Bitfinex is shady, their usd market shows the highest volume for all the coins they have listed, and its just dumping. Price manipulators, scammers hurting the cryptocurrency ERA.

Man you must be an idiot to say that. The staking is an improved pos called dBFT. You are clearly not a fan of Neo so I want you to read this:  
Maybe you will understand why im holding Neo after reading it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:05:47
Neo has a working proof of stake feature, you can create tokens on their platform, it is alot like ethereum but it is ahead of Ethereum in some places, POS. POW is horrible, im a miner myself yes but id much rather be staking, the power Ethereum mining consumes is about the amount of what a country uses.

I really want to belive you, but I don´t. It´s not very convincing, you could be some person wanting to defend bitcoin. I hold both Bitcoin and Bitcoincash and I belive that Bitcoin needs change for bitcoincash to fall.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:18:05
It doesnt really matter, bitcoincash is the better bitcoin right now so it should be "The Bitcoin" as segwit bitcoin has major flaws. holding 100 bitcoincash since the weekend started.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:36:21
The point is that they have a working product and a working platform, icos are being created on Neo right now and why talk with me, im just an investor, miner, and developer when you can go to Neo.org and read about it or watch a video explaining you why Neo isnt another copy coin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:55:49
Haha your are compaing Neo to ripple?! Do your research before stating anything like that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:07:06
Nice saying, I like buying stuff but hate replacing what I have as im happy with what I got and don´t want change.
