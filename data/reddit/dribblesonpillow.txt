Nice try, IRS ����

Article is from 8/22. Why post this shit again?
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:15:27
I’ll post the link here in about an hour! Full steps are included

I almost newsed my pants
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:02:34
Awesome! Glad to help. Let us know when you’re up and running 
@_date: 2018-09-17 05:43:38
Jail time. Destroying currency is illegal you bastard! Haha

You must have gone the “with wallet” route. I went with no wallet, but it sounds like (correct me if I’m wrong) that you need to do the wallet if you’re going to set up a Lightening Node, yes? 
Try adding “sudo” without quotes to the beginning of the command — and make sure you are logged in as the Pi user and not the bitcoin user. The Pi user is able to do sudo and bitcoin user cannot.
sudo ./contrib/install_db4.sh $(pwd)
If that doesn’t work let me know. I may start over if the wallet is needed to do Lightning as I am interested in setting that up too!
@_date: 2018-09-18 18:25:42
 No financial benefits. But for me personally, I am a big believer in Bitcoin and running a full node is my way of helping the network, the users, and the blockchain! 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:49:04
I’ve had my Raspberry Pi node running for a couple weeks now! It is very painless if you can read and follow instructions.
@_date: 2018-09-17 05:53:43
Only if they cash out 
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:07:13
Cannot locate the link. Does anyone have it?
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:24:39
Where can I find a dummies guide for an Unraid docker bitcoin full node + LN
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:55:11
K, call me 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:27:28
I just knee jerk posted and then came up with a clarifying question.. original post was: “Taxes?”
New post is: This sounds incredible! I’m in. My only concern is taxes. Will every transaction need to be reported (US) or will that not be an issue because it’s accounted for in the backend
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:54:41
Try this: 
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:42:38
It convinced me to run a full node too. Whether or not you’re interested in LN, full nodes support the infrastructure and are a critical part of decentralization 
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:44:27
Like a pimple
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:55:14
No, it is solely to help strengthen the bitcoin network/infrastructure 
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:49:54
Click it and find out?
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:42:10
My full node finished syncing yesterday. Count me in! 
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:24:09
Way too early. Please calm down
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:28:09
Nice try, IRS!!!

There was a post on here today that someone used Zelle via BISQ and they lost their Eth and $1000. I can’t find the post now but someone had replied with Zelles terms of service verbiage that it should only be used with people you know and trust and that it is against the agreement to use it to purchase crypto currencies
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:39:30
So which method is the safest for both parties?
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:10:05
@_date: 2018-10-14 18:25:19
I’m with you brother 
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:58:25
Agreed and well said! I started buying in November and continue to accumulate every payday. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:52:54
No lambo!  /s
@_date: 2019-11-27 15:01:40
The cost of electricity to run them would make it not profitable
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:53:46
Cool story bro

I’m trying!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:02:50
What dip?

@_date: 2019-04-08 14:05:13
I disagree. Change My Mind.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:08:38
Agreed, thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:27:10
Well said

My friend in California said he had to wear two tank tops today
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:56:44
Is this good or bad?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:10:57
This here. And the uptime is unmatched
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:18:16
Will you mine some stuff for me pls? ��
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:43:00
How do I sign up
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:55:33
They’d have to, or Bakkt would create something to handle the settlement. 
Consider this: How cool would it be for Starbucks to convert their app to use BTC+LN.. Load up funds, use LN to settle. Millions of people already use the app. Convert it and there would be no learning obstacle to adoption. It would be automatic and sbux would save a fortune on CC fees.
Starbucks/Bakkt, are you listening?
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:50:12
Charge your damn phone!! 
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:06:43
Thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:49:38
Question: Do having all these BTC’s tied up in channels have a negative affect on price?
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:55:33
bitcoin boner.

Do they have banana hammocks for sale too?
Edit: Asking for a friend 
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:04:16
thanks! that made me buy more.
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:18:04
That first sentence is a doozy 
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:29:32
We’ve been here before

You are very generous, kind sir
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:51:27
4% is dangerously low. I care about people plus OCD. Thanks for asking friend! 
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:19:41
Good luck brother! I am hopeful it will go back up soon. Either way I’m in it for the long haul
