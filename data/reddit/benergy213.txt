It’s for your own use. So you can put anything you like. I.e TREZOR wallet or ledger or big dong.

I haven’t been involved in crypto long myself. But I signed up to a few people who have helped greatly. The first thing I signed up for was with a man called Sam volkering, he is the editor for crypto profits extreme. (The first ico he recommended went up 10x) 
I also signed up to a group called signal profits. 
I have also recently started following  on twitter. 
Data dash and alessio Rastani are two I watch on YouTube. 
Not sure if the above is what you were looking for. But hope it helps.

Was this the charity you meant ?

In simple terms. If new tether is printed from thin air, and then they use that tether to buy bitcoin, then it keeps up demand of bitcoin, and therefore keeps the price higher. 
I’m sure there is a more detailed explanation out there. But I just think it’s like me making up my own coin which has no value, and then using it to buy something of value.

Holding is good, and I may be wrong in what I’m about to say, but I think it’s important to have information and knowledge to be prepared for a big market dip. I will explain why. 
The mistake I made was to watch my investment grow 10x and then hold on to it and watch it leak back to where I started in the first place. Yes I still had the same amount of crypto currency, but if I had listened to others who were selling and putting there holdings temporarily back into fiat and bought back in I would now have 5x to 10x more cryptos. 
I know hindsight is an exact science, but when you see the TA from the last bitcoin run up there was no support and it had to correct. 
I didn’t lose any cryptocurrency and I didn’t lose anything on my initial fiat investment. What I made in profits I lost l, and it wasn’t a small amount. 
I will not be doing the same in the future.  
Holding in my opinion does not apply to all situations. Yes I agree holding is good through small dips etc. But when it goes parabolic it makes no sense to just hold it all the way back down to the.
In a market that can drop 70+% to me it only makes sense to hold it to as close to the top as you can, sell and then buy back in as close to the bottom as you can.

I thought you were using Cockney rhyming slang.
