The ideal of communism is the same as the ideal of anarchism. The problem with both systems is that they are unable to account for the role of Power (not just Capital- but power in whatever form), so both systems would quite easily be hijacked by a motivated and er.... *able* individual. Some chairman or something with communism, some sort of ruling family and eventually king with anarchism. You can't just magic the state away with goodwill freedom and equality, the need for a state exists and if you ignore that fact the need for a state will still exist but will be available to be captured by some ruthless psycopath who don't give a shit for anything else than Power. Just my two satoshi.

I don't disagree with that, Anarchism (at least outside of the United states) is not considered a capitalist ethos so maybe I neglected to clarify that I don't mean 'Anarcho-Capitalists'... who in my opinion are just naive idiots. The ideal of Communism was that after a transition period of socialism into true and actual Communism- the state would just whither away and die (that was what Marx thought anyway) leaving a society that simply didn't require a state anymore- having outgrown the concept. This is what (real) Anarchists believe too, different routes but still a society without a state. Marx didn't count on Lenin as the first implementer of his ideas though, and how does anyone deal with a ruthless determined and sly bastard like Stalin or Mao anyway.
Leninists, Stalinists, Fascists... these people have their own ideas, they're all about Power and could care less about your communist/anarchist freedom loving *end state.* 
The thing about states and governing structures though is like any tool they can be used in different ways. As a tool to farm the local humanity for labour (in a given area of over-all military/political control)... and as a cage to Power. In fact I think the state always tends to act as a cage to Power somehow because it puts political and economic actors in a situation where they have to play by certain rules, make certain compromises, bargains and allegiances before they can finally proclaim themselves Furher or whatever. simply put- states impose costs- difficulty-adjusted costs at that, on even the very rich. In 'Anarcho-Capitalism" fuckit, just give it a few generations for some particularly rich family to emerge and found a new dynasty on private property that becomes basically their very own monarchist state. Standard really. How would 'property' even be defined uncder anarcho-Capitalism other than the usual way, by force.... it's not like any court structure would exist to settle disputes. All the new boss would need under Anarcho-Capitalism is military control of critical resources.

Bitcoin is like a function (if a math-muggle like me can dare to use that particular word), there's no reason why the relationship you describe cannot go on indefinitely, with the price of a dollar migrating it's way along those bitcoin decimal places. Some people say that bitcoins only use value is the idea that its value will grow in the future... like this is supposed to be some sort of outrage against justice- valuing something because you expect it to grow in value. Well fine, until global economic saturation and thus a fundamental change from anticipating increases in bitcoin value to increases in the overall value of the world economy denominated in bitcoin (decades hence). Basically the bitcoin "bubble" will only last while there's human activity for it to feed on. And no, I am not a libertarian (social democrat actually) and have nothing against fiat *in principal*.

Paper goes back thousands of years, the ancient Chinese where the first I think, and it evolved from the bearer-bonds of traders if I recall correctly. When the state endorsed the idea, they would have made paper acceptable for taxes, and thus from the very beginning of paper being acceptable to pay tax- it would have been a stable currency. Paper has probably been on and off many times over the centuries, not least because you need a pretty organized state to administer the system. In fact coinage was also an invention of states, a good way to share the spoils among the troops and a good way to have tax-payers provide the needs of the army and the state (troops paid in coin, and farmers for example expected to pay tax in those same coins).

Just technologing the fuck out of everything as if 'economics' holds any meaning in a vacuum is silly, as if one could create the experience of a glass of orange juice using grid-paper and origami.

I'm ok with fiat, and the credit system works well if you're trying to start a business or buy a house but need to borrow money to do so. What idiot would borrow a deflationary currency? sure it'd be nice if everyone who would like to live in a house but wasn't rich could buy a house money down, but unfortunately that's not the world we live in and anyway a lot of people who hate fiat would just scream and yell if the government subsidized with tax-money more house building and buying so that more average income people could money down on a shiny new one. Fiat-screechers would also screech and moan if the government used tax money to help the development of more private businesses or whatever, I mean any solution to help do the stuff that our deeply flawed fiat system does would simply bring whines of complaint against "big government". And in any case there's nothing wrong with fiat on paper, it's drawbacks are the extension of failures in governance, and capture by powerful elites. I like bitcoin and fiat, I want as many solutions as possible to use for the things I want to do in life, and for those solutions to keep each other more honest.

Because people consider themselves to know enough about a subject like when to cash out of this goofy new idea based on other factors that they do know about. For instance that goofy new ideas usually fail and that money is a serious matter. I dont consider bitcoin goofy but definitly does look like a weird and suspect notion from the incumbent perspective.
These kind of shortcut catagorizations and broader principals about  the world usually serve most of us pretty well most of the time. Not to mention the sort of group common sense body of knowledge built up over many iterations of the open source adventure that is human life. You do it too probably with subjects you know nothing about. 
"I dunno much about x, but i know a thing or two about the world." 
At a certain point you just know enough about a new idea to know when you can ignore good advice. Its a bit like knowing when to call high or low in the market though. Maybe you only think you know but actually dont know. Donald Rumsfeld refered to something called the Johari Window when he said "there are known knowns and known unknowns, but there are also unknown unknowns". You know what they dont know, sure but what dont you know? 
I'd just take it as peoples way of telling you to lock down your gains because the future is mostly unknowable when they dont understand why bitcoin is your way of doing exactly that.

It can be argued that if you're a poorer country that mostly relies on raw-material and agricultural exports and tourism, that your economy can be quite easily destabilised by a powerful agenda deploying political and economic means from outside of the country. Whatever else can be said, Maduro is certainly not handling the formidable effects of any such antagonist well. If you do want to topple a government, then attacking its currency is a good way to cause the sort of desperately maleable situation we see now. 
Is the US trying to topple Maduro's government? Well they've had previous. Is Maduro an incompetent and malicious fool? Possibly, and if so he'd still be even if he was a staunch right-wing Libertarian (small government ethos can quickly bloat into massive spending on security and cops clubbing crowds of hungry poor people). There's so much to get through before it's possible to argue the merits or not of socialism with Venezuela. It's lazy, at the very least (eta: to say that Venezuela is borked because Socialism).

I've always been interested in the invention of money, it's fascinating stuff. And I recognized bitcoin for what it was as soon as I heard about it. I'm not in this for ideological reasons, and in any case see no contradiction with social democracy, let alone government itself- and deflationary currency. 
Although currency was itself originally an invention of the state, what the state itself is about at the most fundamental level (and here even Libertarians agree with me although their descriptions are crass and unsubtle and loses a lot of important information) the state is about the management of power. 
All other services that can involve the state are built on that, including those owned or captured by interests (kings, preisthoods, aristocracies, bankers, corps...) and those not. It doesn't matter what you make your money out of; gold, fiat, crypto, commercial-IOU's, government ration-points, celebrity signatures, Picasso's, faery-wings... the state is about the management of power. When power is managed and we don't live in some sort of *perfect competition of violence*, we can start thinking about other stuff and for me, social democracy is a reasonable political framework. 
Libertarians often talk about how governments always inflates the money supply etc, but for me that like many government flaws is a management issue. Humans always fuck things up you see, it's how we help the universe do it's entropy stuff, any perfect on paper system you come up with we're gonna fuck up somehow, at least on the edges, including running ourselves on the large scale as some sort of polity. There's just no getting away from it, so how we like to fuck up fiat is by bail-outs and inflation and you can already see various ideas forming on how to fuck up this crypto thing we've come up with, because there's always some sort of management system in which failure and error and corruption gets to accumulate. It's our behavioural version of thermo-dynamics really.
Anyway, I want to be a free individual human being even though I live in an imperfect human world, and I have nothing against making my contribution to the general pot as it were (despite the spillages), I consider it the subscription we all pay to live in a civilised society, and the only way to take on its many flaws is to take politics and democracy seriously. I also recognize that the welfare of my neighbours- the teacher, and the doctor, the builder, the architect, the artist, the musician, the unemployed writer and even that fat slob who just likes to eat pie and all their children too is also my welfare. This will be the case regardless of whether we use fiat or crypto or whatever going forward. 
Thinking that where money comes from means fuck all in terms of the flow of power through a society is to my mind a massive and lamentable error. Bitcoin is cool yo, Libertarianism is in my opinion deluded and naive but Bitcoin is cool even though we will always have to consider the flow of power through society and the welfare of the commons, these aren't issues that go away because crypto money. Education is not a luxury product, it matters to me that your kid can read and write, more so when I'm old and perhaps again if reincarnation is real and I find myself a baby again. The car I drive might be mine but I drive it on roads built by tax-expenditures, I stand on the shoulders of giants as we all do, and the giants gotta eat too.

Not so good for savers, a lot of people want to own an asset that they know will be solid,  so their x amount of bitcoin is solidly whatever percent of 21 mill their x amount is...if that makes sense. Because bitcoin is a software protocol as well as a form of value, it's easy to assume that people want and expect the same as happens with any other software, with a high cadence of change and every other month a new revolution. It's not necessarily the case. Conservatism has its own value, prowling the crypto world every day to catch the next big thing is not always what most people want. I say...innovate by all means, but also recognise the value of the "Debian conservatism", people don't want their savings to end up being an app that was popular in 2017 but now here's this new next big thing.  It'd be great if thenextbig thing in crypto was based on btc as a settlement layer, if we could build on btc success instead of starting from scratch all the time and trying to overthrow what people have already invested in. In my opinion the next big thing in crypto will be something that leverages bitcoins accrued advantages... probably why BU was "so interested in our planet" to quote the movie Independence Day.

It's a dangerous misunderstanding to think that being scammed means you're stupid. Stupidity can be useful to scammers of course, but often enough they rely on their victims being intelligent. Intelligent people can be surprisingly easy to manipulate using their imagination or their ability to engage with abstracts but overlook deceptively simple relationships.

Bullshit, barter has never been a form of commerce, it is in fact a conceptual ideal to which money tries to be the most like, the massless invisible whooshing sound between dancing pairs of use-values.

There is no difference, economies of scale tend toward centralization like the converging lines of grand perspectives. What's needed is a core that can't be captured by insiders. Pretty difficult trick to pull off.

Ah,  the old Roman Firefighter approach. Actually not quite, the Roman Firefighters would offer to put out your fire for the right price, and if you didnt agree theyd just stand back and watch it burn to the ground and then offer to buy the wreck.

That doesnt represent me, a world that punishes trust and whatever it is you mean by "laziness" doesnt sound like a good world to me. More like the firey eyed vision typically laid out by antihumanists. Brings to mind the Spanish conquestadores on first arriving at Hispaniola and finding millions of easy going freindly nudist natives... whom they quikly put to the sword and enslaved for the greater glory of Isabella, Ferdinand and the Church.

"Core developers prefer to gradually, not rapidly enlarge bitcoin's transaction handling capabilities.[19] Core developers believe in the premise that barriers to running a full node should be kept low as possible so that the blockchain layer at the very lowest level remains highly decentralized.[18] Core has reputation for tending for being risk averse. This is demonstrated by the reluctance of Core developers to increase the network’s ability to process transactions."
I'm down with that. Core is a Process *and* a Principal.
@_date: 2018-04-14 19:24:17
I disagree. It takes all-sorts to make a world, thus bitcoin must account for all-sorts.
