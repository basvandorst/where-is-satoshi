They've been working like crazy for the last day on this maintenance. I'm sure a lot of their team hasn't slept or left the office in that time. Been there, done that... Looks like somebody went stream of consciousness.

Wow, that worked quick! Good job, everybody!

AYH! All-Year High!

Shoot. Just a bit outside my price range.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:14:38
It's okay. I've [got something for this](
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:26:24
Are you sure you did everything correctly when you submitted the transaction?
Because typically in situations like these, the problem is between the chair and the keyboard.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:17:04
To clarify, is this good or bad? The article is talking like it's bad, but it's also saying that when China clamped down in September, BTC was sub $5K, so it didn't seem to hurt it much then.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:11:29
Hodling fast. At this point, I'd rather risk losing it all than cut losses.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:00:48
Me going to sleep last night: can't wait to buy the dip in the morning!
Me this morning: heck
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:35:28
It all depends on perspective. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:07
Yup. If I had only held onto all of my investments when I bought them, I'd be up so much right now. But selling low and buying in later has hurt me. Hodling works.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:09:11
Buy at $1K, sell at $10K = $9K profit
Buy at $1K, sell at $10K, buy at $10K = $9K profit
Buy at $1K, sell at $10K, buy at $10K, sell at $9K = $9K profit and $1K loss
Buy at $1K and hold: no profit

I'm ignoring that I got out of LTC at $102 to buy BTC at $16000 and finding another hobby for a couple weeks until we're back above $18000 again. HODLing engaged!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:51:26
Good. That way you won't panic sell before it recovers. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:42:05
Heck, I'll sell people bullion for Bitcoin any day!
But this is cool. If I wasn't already pretty well stocked on PMs for the year and waiting to buy into more crypto, I might pick some more bullion up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:24:29
So you can basically have the same wallet active on two devices for redundancy (or recover it on a new wallet if one dies), but because the transactions all sync with the blockchain, there's no risk of the wallet having outdated balances on it?
That makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:49
Oh yeah, I keep track of everything in a spreadsheet. Definitely in the red right now. I didn't start buying until $10k. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:45:32
Move along, move along, nothing to see here. Don't you know the economy is doing great? Just ask the President! This is the strongest economy in the history of forever! It's definitely standing on its own and not propped up by smoke and mirrors.

Wait, wrong sub.

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:26:11
It's okay. I keep pumping more money in, so I'll gladly take advantage of the fear selling.

Me yesterday: "I'm going to wait to buy more until it dips to below $10k again."
Me today: "Sure am glad I bought more before it hit $13k."
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:26:27
Yeah, I bought the dip when the dip was $3k higher than it is now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:01:58
It's about 1% higher than the market price they list at any given time. I figure that's a baked in premium for them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:33:33
Yeah, but you're gonna HODL anyway so it's all good. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:43:06
Yes, yesterday was the bubble pop. Sell all of your BTC now before it hits zero.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:26:17
I did that when the ATH crossed 10k. Then it bombed to $8K and I was down 20%.
Don't get discouraged. I stuck around, kept buying more as it dipped on its way back up, and now I'm in the green more value than I originally put in that first day, and I'm up 20% overall.

How do you even fit four Lambos in a Tesla?

Brother. We're practically twins. But I sold my LTC for more than I bought it for, so I took a small profit. I can't be mad about that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:40:25
Dollar cost averaging. I bought on the way up, too.

Nothing. Students actually pay YOU for the privilege of being a student, if you're a university. It's like stealing candy from a baby. Or like stealing tens of thousands of dollars from a teenager.

I'm pretty sure it's a 360 boneless kickflip to nose manual grind.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:57
On 12/6 we dipped to $13K net of fees, so I bought $150 and it's now worth $198.
On 12/9 we dipped to $14.8k net of fees, so I bought $100 and it's now worth $116.02.
On 12/19 we dipped to $17.4k net of fees, so I bought $200. Let's fucking roll.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:07
That's the price point at which my original investment will be able to pay off my student loans. See you there.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:41:02
Main reason to go back to fiat, imo: to pay debt that inflates at a slower rate than your crypto deflates.
In other words, if $10,000 of BTC becomes worth $100,000 in two years, you can essentially pay off $100,000 of fiat debt (a mortgage balance, maybe) with $10,000 of investment. That's a huge deal.
If I can pay off my student loans with BTC, I'll pull out and do exactly that. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:44:50
Does it count if I bought at the beginning of the dip at $17k?
Of course it does. See you boys on the other side of 20. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:52:36
Nobody knows. But unless you invested more than you can afford to lose, there's arguably more upside to holding than risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:42:23
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.

@_date: 2017-12-01 14:40:07
Right. There are 10 coins on the Top 100 under $0.10 a piece.
37 under $1.
88 under $100.
If you bought one of each of those 88 and any ONE of them hit $10,000, you'd have more than recouped your investment.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:53:47
Sounds like unknowable speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:24:43
When it went from $90 to $160? Yes, I would have rather been in for that. ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:02:38
I've got buys at 9.8, 10, 13, 17, and 16, in that order, over the past couple weeks.
I might buy more if it drops to 10 or 11 again, but I'm HODLing until it gets back up to 20, 25 at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:06:05
Did you name him Bit?
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:11:48
The fact that they default you to the option with lower fees is shocking to me. The fact that you're upset about that is even more shocking to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:14:56
This is bones. I've been tracking my hodlings in drive, but manually updating the prices multiple times a day from coinbase and kraken. This looks way easier.

I'm interested in this guarantee of yours. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:48:23
I was expecting a drop at 11K. Then 12K. Then 13K. Then I stopping waiting for a drop and bought more at 12.9K.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:12
I'd give it some time. It's still up like, 20% since last week. Anything can happen from here. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:48:23
My math is off, you're right.
But that would still be a 1600% increase in whatever you put into it. Not terrible.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:34:08
Thanks! To be fair, it was a total crapshoot. I could have just as easily lost my hat. But as long as BTC keeps going up, I'm a happy HODLer. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:57:55
Maybe all the way down to the point where it's only up 10% month over month. The horror!
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:26:35
I boosted my overall gains by 4% by buying the dip. No complaints here. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:17:39
The dip to a price that's still double digit percentages over last week. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:21:00
And a merry Christmas to all of us!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:54:55
But I have a price alert set up at 10.4 just in case so I can pick some more up.

Noob question on this that I'm in the process of reading up on right now, so I figured I'd ask here:
If your coin is stored on a hardware device, what if the electronics in the device fail? I'm hearing about ways to back up your wallet, but haven't found a how-to guide yet.

If you want to get technical about it, you don't owe the tax until you file your tax return at the end of the year. Assuming it's the same in his country.
So as long as he's got enough set aside for the capital gains (again, assuming it's the same in his country), he's fine.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:35
Well, not yet! So thanks for catching my mistake on that. ;)

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:59:58
I don't disagree with you. But right now because of rampant speculation, it's a currency that's gaining value like crazy against the USD. If the Euro was killing the dollar, you'd be just as foolish to buy a car in Euros instead of dollars.
BTC is very much in its infancy. This too shall pass.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:56:56
I just want to say, the first day I bought in was the top of the ATH right before the dip from $11K to $9k, and as of today, I'm officially back in the green, despite ETH still being 16% below where it was that day and LTC still being in the red.
My BTC buys have saved my butt until the next dip. And then I'll just buy more...
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:40:18
So am I understand you to be saying that when BTC/LTC goes up, LTC will be more likely to go up regardless of Fiat/LTC?
That makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:43:21

Once I've got enough gains to pay off my student loans, I'll cash out that much and then reinvest over time.
If I never have that much in gains, I won't have lost much anyway.

Keeping my fingers crossed for you! I got in a couple weeks ago with a few hundred bucks, and that's about all I'm comfortable with right now. You and me are in a similar boat. I figure a few months from now, hopefully we'll be real glad we got in.

If investing 0% luck, why do half of managed funds perform worse than index funds? If it was so skill-based, you'd think the people getting paid to do it would hit better than 50% against the baseline.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:48:52
Yes and no. Real estate still has value even after the bubble burst. It's just not as strong of an investment as it was before then.
Irony being that an investment that's a bubble isn't really safe to begin with. Maybe productive is a better word...

There was some investor that did something similar with penny stocks right before WWII. He put some money into every stock trading under $100, and the gains from the wartime and postwar economy boom on the ones that hit vastly outweighed his losses on the ones than tanked. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:00
I bought at $10k right before it dropped to $8k. That original investment dropped 20% immediately and now it's worth 70% more than it was when I bought it.
You'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:43:33
I did some buying around then. I'm down double digits in percent. Not concerned. What I put in was no more than I'd be willing to lose. This is gonna be fun. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:31:16
I'll allow that. Then maybe I could pay off my student loans.

Goooootttt it. So really, the 24 code words are the access for the coins. The hardware wallet is just the device you can use to move them from place to place. Can you use the same seed words with most hardware and software wallets?
And who decides the seed words? Are they unique to the wallet or does the owner set them?
This all seems pretty reasonable to me. After I do some more buying this month, I'll probably move my stuff off of coinbase to a wallet and find a couple secure places to store my seeds.
Thanks for walking me through this stuff, dude! Huge help. There's a lot of noise out there searching for Bitcoin info, and having access to a community like this is a huge resource. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:20:03
I'm not sure I follow how that connects to why fiat money is inflationary.
But my answer is no, because I expect the value of BTC to go up, so paying back a 2 BTC car payment would be more painful later.
I expect the value of the USD to go down, so a $20,000 car loan will be less painful to pay off with future dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:11:07
I have like, $50 worth of BTC there that I can't transfer out because their minimum to withdraw is something like .005 BTC. I just really don't feel like transferring more in to be able to pay $16 to transfer it out. So it'll HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:07:33

Fun data point: I first bought in on 11/29 at the (then) ATH of $10,110 before it dropped back down to ~$8000 (-20%) in the next two hours.
I'm currently up 15% including buying more in bits and dips along the way.

**Nothing** has underlying value. If people don't want to pay any money for gold, gold has 0 value.
It's used in commercial, retail, and technological industries, so it has *expected* value, but it has no *inherent* value.
Nothing has inherent value. Only the value ascribed to it by what people are willing to pay or give up for it.
