Don't remember with Trezor, but keep key and nano S have on device restore so you don't ever enter the seed phrase onto a computer 
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:07:55
Mycelium supports 'Ledger HD' accounts. Not sure if that includes the nano s
@_date: 2016-08-28 07:08:46
Looks to be the case. Seems they shuffle the order, and add false words, but you are correct , it would reduce security after restore. Maybe another advantage to ledger nano s.
@_date: 2016-08-17 14:51:31
Because you need to visually see if the hardware has been altered to expose the private keys 
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:30:38
Depends on many things: what you do with your mycelium backup, how was your paper wallet generated, what do you do with your paper wallet after you've created it, how do you spend from your paper (if you ever decide to)...
Personally I prefer mycelium over other Android wallets because it is more feature packed; hardware wallet support for Trezor, keep key, and ledger being one of them 
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:15:14
That's not racist all at...

While I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your reply, and while I agree long-term scaling is absolutely a technical challenge, I still maintain that the inability for the bitcoin network to adequately handle transnational demand is due to politics, entirely.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but those 10k transactions won't cause confirmation delays for any transaction with higher fees correct ? So then those valid transactions (which you call spam), would in fact not be cause of the delays?

The transaction size doesn't depend on the amount of BTC or equivalent USD sent in anyway.

No, but we have ~131 years before that happens

Let's take the litecoin blockchain as comparison.


Litecoin has existed for years, and has survived any attempted 'hacks'. 


Again, litecoin is a solution to the distributed consensus problem. Albeit, in almost the identical way Bitcoin is a solution, it is a solution nonetheless. 


Bitcoin by far has the most widespread adoption, as it is far more popular than litecoin. However, I would argue bitcoin's and litecoin's popularity are closer to each other than say bitcoin and any other settlement/payment system. Keep in mind bitcoin is _very much_ not a mainstream technology in terms of actual use. It is in the popular lexicon however. 
 In terms of adoption rates then, clearly Bitcoin is more successful. If the article defines successful as merely 'the most widely adopted', then sure bitcoin is the only successful blockchain tech. But if that were the case then the article would have said 'most widely adopted'. As it stands, litecoin has widespread adoption (though less so bitcoin), has existed for several years, withstood 'hacking' attempts, and provides a solution to the distributed consensus problem. So yeah, litecoin is an instance of a successful blockchain technology other than bitcoin.

be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.


understanding render their risks widely acceptable _relative to the
risks of not deploying them_
I'm pretty sure the risks of not deploying them are pretty clear now. Is a BU fork and chain split less risky than additional 2/4/8 blocksize increase rescaled for SW increase? I don't think so. See Vinnys last article for instance.

thats not what i asked.


Why is SW + 2MB not viable?
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:18:16
@_date: 2017-02-18 04:04:09
 I understand raising the max block size indefinitely is not a long term solution. I also agree that not every transaction needs to be on chain, and off-chain scaling solutions are paramount to long term scaling. If i could choose for all of bitcoin, I would choose to have the community make a concerted effort to obtain more data / engage in more research. It's been said that a 2MB (or 4 or 8) hard fork will increase hardware requirements to the point where node count will drop and decentralization will be weakened.
Given the current node count, distribution, hardware requirements, hardware/broadband costs and availability, I'd like to see someone attempt to quantify what the effect of raising the max block size to various levels will likely have on the network.  What does an acceptable node count/distribution look like? What is a near 'optimal' not count/distribution look like? Is there a threshold for node count/distribution at which no changes to the network that risk reducing that to threshold should even be considered? Can we quantify or predict (with any sense of confidence) the relationship between transaction demand, max transaction throughput, new user adoption, new nodes due to new users? 
I don't have the answers to any of these question. I don't anyone has a clear understanding of the all the complexities involved (both technical and economical).  It's easy for me to see that 1GB max block size is probably not the best idea. It's difficult for me to see that a 2MB max blocksize would be somehow detrimental to the network / node operators, or that it would necessarily lead to a further kicking of the can down the road. So if it were all up to me, I would say HF SW + 2MB now, while further off-chain scaling solutions are being worked on and while further on-chain scaling is more research/quantified so that we may better understand what changes would actually be detrimental, and what changes would be acceptable. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:45:41

@_date: 2017-03-15 16:46:14


You're right of course, but other cryptos have ways of scaling beyond bitcoins current TX throughput. That's not to say that doesn't come at a cost, but "they'd run into the same [scaling] problem [as bitcoin]" doesnt mean "alts don't have higher tx throughput than bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:18:31
If SW is a compromise as you claim, then both sides BU and Core would be surrendering some piece of their desired outcome. What piece of Core's roadmap are they surrendering in order to reach a compromise with BU?
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:06:42
Yes, and I'm still asking about SW + 2MB. No one has provided anything that supports the fact that SW is viable, but SW + 2MB is not.

I've noticed that ACH transfers don't always post by the date coinbase says they will. No worries though, typically if it doesn't post on the date they say, it will likely be the next day.

You can actually have your seed, Trezor device, and PIN all stolen/known and unless you they also know your passphrase they can't access your coins. Of course, if you don't have another seed  backup or Trezor with the same account, you can't recover them either.

so you just throwing shit out there and seeing what sticks? or do you have any information that leads you to think this might be the case?
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:00:46
He didn't say it wasnt  important
@_date: 2016-11-03 14:34:59
It certainly is a payment method, I use it to buy things all the time 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:01:03
of course. My only point is that there exist other coins that could (and have for bursts) handle a tx throughput greater than bitcoin, for less fees. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:45:20
Haven't heard of eclair but I'll look into it. Doubtful that any alt will see merchant acceptance rates similar to Bitcoin this year. Users will switch to an alt that looks like it can scale better, without making too many  compromises; then merchant adoption will follow.
Edit: aww yes, I have checkout eclair. Very nice 
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:23:58
It won't take a few years either
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:34:32
Not all coins have / will have this much difficulty scaling. That includes on chain and second layer. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:42:29


That's not true. All altcoins have scaling issues, and of course, some sacrificial design decisions might be made in each various alt. 
Bitcoin has fungibility issues that have been solved in other coins, albeit at a cost. Bitcoin confirmations are slow, and other alts implement faster confirmations, albeit at a cost of security / centralization. Bitcoin is difficult to change, which may be considered a good thing or a bad thing depending on your perspective, other alt coins have regular, safe hard-forks that enable them to implement state of the art advances. Some coins have built in governance, with voting at the protocol level. 
To suggest that Bitcoin is the end all be all of cryptos, and somehow represents the best balance between security, privacy, and decentralization is naive. Currently it enjoys the highest security, but there's nothing inherent to Bitcoin that suggests no other alt dethrone could one day dethrone bitcoin due to its ability to, with out paralyzing stagnation, implement upgrades to the protocol which allow better scaling.

So you claim ETH should be  failure, because you _predict_ ETH will fail? OK. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 03:15:37
Credit cards, PayPal , Venmo, ...
@_date: 2016-09-22 00:32:55
Did you pay directly in BTC or was it a bitcoin debit card?
@_date: 2016-09-22 03:38:45
That's what I was thinking. Just wanted to eliminate the possibility they  had to do some weird intermediary transaction like customer paid manager in btc, manager paid on their VISA because BTC POS was down
@_date: 2016-09-17 03:13:37
Another r/bitcoin coinbase bashing thread, what a surprise

Capacity is independent of fees
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:58:17
No, the median blocksize is near capacity, so bad luck (which hasn't changed over time) will more frequently result in a larger backlog. Median blocksize near 1MB doesn't mean all blocks are full, or  that there wont be periods of small backlog, it means events like this are more likely to happen 
@_date: 2016-10-11 00:41:03
fee market won't increase capacity. surely you get this by now
@_date: 2016-10-20 00:26:59
Suppose I have half a billion dollars to blow on attacking bitcoin, couldn't I just create and broadcast transactions nonstop (paying a high fee so they'll be included in blocks quicker). My bankroll would effectively let me price out most other users. It would cause mass congestion that would force users to give up using crypto or transfer to another alt. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 00:21:22
I only have some answers. You determine monthly budget you'd like to spend, payouts are determined by % time spent on each site, and this offers the advantage of supporting content creators without relying on advertisement revenue 
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:41:28
full blocks plus bad luck results in a large backlog regardless of fee
@_date: 2016-10-20 14:37:17
Or ya know, myspace
@_date: 2016-10-07 05:40:11
He never said anything about fees, hes taking about capacity. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 01:46:00


Transactional capacity of bitcoin is independent fees. That is fact, true by definition. If you refuse to see this, I can't help ya. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 13:42:03
Didn't really answer my question
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:38:34
Fair enough, I'll use betamax as an example then. 
@_date: 2016-10-20 02:25:31
I don't have sufficient technical knowledge  to answer that. Hopefully someone else can answer 
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:03:27
Just curious, why would you prefer bitcoin be the only crypto?
@_date: 2016-10-19 15:16:09
Alternatively, how many transactions with high fees could you make for half a billion dollars to grind the network to a halt, and how long could you maintain that?
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:23:39
again, you should be looking at hashrate, not # blocks mined
@_date: 2016-10-08 00:20:47
Because coinbase provides a valuable service to many (but not all). I love coinbase (and circle). 
@_date: 2016-10-07 20:20:06
Capacity is independent of fees. This is fact. The maximum transaction throughput bitcoin can technically handle is independent of transaction fees. 
The maximum number of people that can all fit on a bus is not determined by the price of the ticket. The number of people actually riding the bus of course depends on tick price, but capacity is not a measure of the actual number of riders. It's the maximum number of riders the bus can accommodate .

What were the on chain scaling ideas discussed at the conference?
@_date: 2016-10-04 14:36:53
So your are actually correct. They've re branded their image, but they do allow users to buy/sell BTC
@_date: 2016-10-04 05:00:38
You're wrong
@_date: 2016-10-13 03:57:17
Who are the bad guys ?

That's odd. Have you not looked a hashrate  pie chart the last couple months?

It's shouldn't be used for cold storage of large amounts. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 05:49:55
Different use case than Trezor
Edit, from open dime website 
"Opendime is a small USB stick that allows you to spend Bitcoin like a dollar bill. Pass it along multiple times. "
"Should I use it for cold storage?
Like most electronic devices, if stored properly it should last decades.
But No. Opendime was not designed as long term cold storage. For that we suggest you use a device that allows you to backup private keys.
@_date: 2016-07-23 23:24:05
I've had this issue with the coinbase app, there's a delay before coinbase even propagates the transaction so it's unrelated to confirmation time 
@_date: 2016-07-23 07:41:56
I agree about POTUS whole heartedly =). I just believe non contributors are still entitled to thoughtful opinions without being reduced to claims of mere parroting. Can I contribute significant code or protocol advancements? No. Can I make value judgements on proposals made by other developers as equally competent as core developers? Of course. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:49:06
@_date: 2016-07-30 07:43:46
They're meant to facilitate off chain physical transactions, and moderate private key security that's very easy to use. They are not for large savings or long term storage. A backup would completely defeat the point of open dime.

That's what people do: read things, listen to discussions, think on them, and form their own opinions

You mean until core can no longer cripple adoption 
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:31:45
No tx throughput available for that

They aren't mutually exclusive. You can store your private keys on Trezor and manage your Trezor through electrum
