The paypal/visa transaction fee is a valid point, but that benefits the merchant more than the customer. It's up to the merchant to pass the saving along to the customer.
International orders is a great point, and also transferring money globally without the excessive fees. However, neither of these appeal to your average consumer. I'm *ok* with that, but if the benefits of bitcoin aren't for the average consumer, why would getting bitcoins accepted by a major retailer benefit bitcoin? An average consumer would have to go through another step/s in completing the transaction. 
Purchasing bitcoin to spend bitcoin seems terribly flawed at the moment. It's a novelty to the average consumer that might save a buck or two, but not worth keeping track of another account.

Like I said, that just makes bitcoins a slower, volatile prepaid visa card.
Where's the benefit to the consumer to keep buying bitcoins?

What happens when the current hype wears off? A lot of the buying/selling going on right now is speculation.
What's the value in a consumer buying bitcoins to buy something? What benefit does a bitcoin using consumer actually gain over a debit card? For me, bitcoin is an annoying middleman that confuses and clogs up a transaction (unless I've already got a stash of bitcoins lying around). 
Going from USD&gt;BTC&gt;purchase is terrible. And if you've got a BTC wallet for purchases, why? The price is so volatile right now, you won't know how much it's worth one day to the next.
Not saying this won't stabilize in the future, but I think a major retailer accepting bitcoins at this point would cause way more harm than good.
