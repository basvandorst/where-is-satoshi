Solutions in search of problems isn't the answer, and it certainly isn't Bitcoin 2.0
I'm not saying that smart contracts have no value, but you're misunderstanding the primary use case for crypto at this point and the reason people are actually using it in the real world.  Smart contracts &amp; related wont have even a semblance of an economy for at least 5 years, and even then the use cases will be far more limited than you likely imagine.

I agree that we have more security than we need right now, but if the value of Bitcoin goes up and the cost to attack the network stays flat, then at some point you run into an issue with no clear recourse if we've migrated off-network for the majority of transactions.  Under such a scenario out into the future, just when we start to need the security the most is when it begins to fail?
A higher bitcoin price and growing marketcap only creates a greater incentive to attack but the defense against that attack cannot scale without fees.  That's why my OP stresses the *relative* gap between block reward and market cap.

Coinbase is plenty safe in my experience, but there's also lots of other options like localbitcoins, circle, exchanges, etc...  If you get any trouble from your current bank just move your money to a smaller local bank or credit union and they're unlikely to care at all.
I think the horror stories you hear are few and far between, and likely we've only gotten one side of it.
