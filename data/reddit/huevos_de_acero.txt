this is a reply I posted on Facebook about the process of doing it here (USA) vs Canada: 
'the Robocoin process here in Texas is primarily identified through a goverment-issued ID (which i believe is deemed as proof of identity everywhere in the USA). 
the second is a palm-scan, which is performed 4 times (yeah, in case you wanna read again, a TOTAL PALM SCAN DONE 4 TIMES...
After 5 minutes you get an approval.
God bless the USA-NSA!'
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:04:46
There's also a perfectly visible screen eye-level that tells you real time the print you'll be making with your palm while your whole arm is inside that machine....INDEED BIZARRE.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:35:40
no, i believe the window said 'Document type' and 'Country', the default is 'USA' and 'driver's license' so I didn't explore that option

It was a somewhat painless experience. Here's the rundown: 
1. You click on the big (huge) button that says 'BUY BITCOIN' you get asked for a cell ph to text you a verification code, you enter the verification code sent to your phone.
2. Scan your goverment issued ID (in my case I used my Texas driver's license)
3. Scan your right hand (no, I'm not kidding, you have to introduce your arm into a 'palm reader' that scans your hand 4 times)
4. You create a PIN number.
5. The Bitcoin machine tells you that your application has been submitted and to come back once you have been approved (!)
6. Wait a few mins, got a txt saying my application was approved (!), so now whenever I put my phone  combo i'm ready to buy Bitcoins now.
7. After I logged in for the 2nd time (I was chatting with some people chatting, it's a bar after all), and put in my ph # and PIN, I was able to deposit CASH into it ($20), asked if I wanted to generate a new wallet (yes) and finally got a paper receipt with my Bitcoin address AND my private key along with a QR code.
Whole thing took about 10mins, maybe less.

there were talks about a new concept called 'cryptographic proof of solvency' for self-regulating exchanges...the funny thing is, I was sitting right next to Charlie lee (creator of litecoin and Coinbase guy) and he told me that it would take a whole lot for Coinbase to implement such thing because the way the cold wallets are structured. Interesting stuff. Oh and Charlie Shrem threw a rant so bad that he cried lol (true story)

this is a one-off, custom designed by a lady here in Austin that makes 'mascot' costumes. There's a frame inside built on flexible PVC. Material is really breathable and the actual costume is pretty light with shoulder and waist straps inside. I think when that picture was taken I was checking my FB/Reddit account WHILE INSIDE the costume
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:07:04
and in case someone wonders, that big hole on the right side is the PALM READER where you have to introduce your arm almost elbow-deep in that machine while an on-screen menu appears with the real-time imprint. BIZARRE.

bitcoin blockchain technology project is offtopic?
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:17:32
Interesting. Even though according to Landauer's principle, computation must be accompanied by entropy increase. 
But then again, in the end the Artilect discovers and masters the concept of 'reversible computation', after ALL the data has been collected. Thereby producing a 'Big Bang' explosion. 
The way I see it, blockchain=time. So in our Universe, at least, not possible to 'invert' the blockchain, until the end of times (literally).

Yes that's the idea, that 5 bitcoin will be later a ridiculous large amount of money, to make the bet super high stakes, and that's why Szabo backs out right away! 
@_date: 2016-02-02 07:26:04
Reversed as in... Deleting stuff from it? Because if that's the question, then no. It's and append-only log. Meaning it's a permanent database of what happened. 
If reversed as in... Time? Then is as reversible as time itself, so nope again. 
Reversed as in... Changing the version of what's there? With sufficient computing power, in theory, yes. But not practical at all.

@_date: 2016-05-10 02:58:45
It has EVERYTHING to do with Bitcoin. This is what Satoshi Nakamoto meant for average people to use bitcoin with (as a unit of account) and Bitcoin (the platform/blockchain) as a payment network.    Thereby rendering Chase Bank useless.     
Also, my Tl, Dr (too long, didn't read) mentions Bitcoin in one line paragraph. If you are too illiterate to read the whole post, then you are, my friend, an IMBECILE.     
TL, DR this guy /turpin23 is an idiot. How's that for off topic, you moronic, near sighted, piece of shit?
