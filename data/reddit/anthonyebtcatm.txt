Fair POV, thanks for the insight, but I don't believe having it show up on a couple website is obsolete in the slightest.

Our fee is variable and it's not the same for purchase and for sale, also not the same across each of the ATMs, it's calculated automatically according to market conditions and the amount of bitcoins that we have available.
A nice guideline that would be closer to the answer you're looking for is, around 10% for purchase (if you purchase BTC from the ATM) and around 8% for sale (if you sell BTC to the ATM) and please remember these vary from day to day.

That's actually a good idea. Yeah we only list the price of a full bitcoin as of now, thanks for the recomendation though, will definitely consider it.

This is it, the ATMs are place within the location, so if the place is closed, the ATMs are unreachable.
