I always give them change - i think they got it worse than us (regardless of their addictions - as i'm a recovering alcoholic so I know how it is).  and you're a drug user too (coffee, food, nicotine, etc.) but how are drugs judged?  by how negative they are for you or how therapeutic they are?  and this was actually a joke btw.  I already spent the $60.00 to get the $1.50 i needed before I posted the second post - I'm just new to bitcoins and trying to understand them better (is "begging" for a few dollars worth of bitcoins ok when you are a bit short or is it considered tacky?  Now I know!).  But your tone - wow - bad day at the "stick up your butt" plant today?  or are you just an unpleasant person who doesn't believe in explaining things to people or simply not commenting at all?  I just don't get it...

wow, I owe you a huge thank you!  Because of you I don't have to take out the garbage!  (I bet my gf that you would respond in a fashion that, combined with your other responses, will classify you as an "Internet Troll."  (She bet that you would just simply not respond, thus making you sort of a troll but not enough to be fully considered one).  Thanks again - the couch and a nug sure beats the trash and the cold!

asking politely is different - plus you can't beat that view - what a spectacular place!
