Seriously, what would prevent the NSA or any US gov branch from using their practically unlimited budget to fund supercomputers designed to mine and take control of 51+% of the blockchain? That would be bad, right?

Sure, but it gets the point across. Nobody fully controls Bitcoin, but anyone can control a small part of it (mining) or make the market grow by putting money in it.

Then what about the time when the average person won't even be able to afford 1 bit?
@_date: 2014-09-28 03:56:24
Yeah, but 51% is seen as the "biggest" problem in Bitcoin; anyone with more than half of hashrate controls the blocks, etc etc. Compared to that, doublespending the unconfirmed is pretty "easy". I wouldn't have the know-how on how to do that myself though.

Meh, it's easy to scramble money between addresses in such a way that it couldn't reliably be traced back to the guy. If he just does that for a while and wait a few months he'll have his bitcoins (minus transaction fees from scrambling) with nothing proving he owns them.

Doing anything with Bitcoin will affect the price in some way. This includes using it as an actual currency, like buying stuff with it on overstock. The market will eventually adjust itself to a stable value when the marketcap is high enough and enough people are using it.
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:04:57


Man, if I were a billionaire I'd be tempted to just fuck with the bitcoin market for my own amusement. Buy/sell a few millions worth for the hell of it just to see the price go up and down.

Could you imagine, though? You wake up one day and all the headlines are about the US Gov seizing ebay because illegal items slip through, and they also seize paypal because it was used in some case for money laundering. Then the headlines twist it into saying the us dollar is a currency only used by druglords.
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:45:26
and, if done right, is only used once and never again. And you have no idea if the coins it spent were simply sent to himself. Or another address. Or which address is the change address and which is the buyer's address.

There are so many variables in economics that you can't just pin point one and say "This. This is why the price has dropped." It's a chaotic system. It goes by pure supply and demand. If I burn a $5 dollar bills then everyone else's money is worth slightly more. But there are so many USD in circulation that this "slightly more" is not even worth considering. Same thing should happen with BTC is enough people (read: everyone) is using it some day.
What I don't like though is it's still piggyback riding on the USD: A merchant doesn't sell an object for 2 BTC because he thinks it's worth 2 BTC, he sells it for 2 BTC because he thinks it's worth 2 times whatever a bitcoin is currently worth in USD. Things like bitpay and coinbase make this rate automatic so merchants don't have to deal with changing the prices every time the rate changes. 
In my ideal world, everyone is paid in Bitcoin and merchants adjust their prices based on their suppliers' prices and so on.

But won't most convenient services end up being "Bitcoin Banks"? We'd have some of the same problems we have with regular banks. The cool thing with BTC is you can be your own bank, but it gets complicated, so you store your BTC elsewhere and, well, look at Gox now.

I'm seeing Satoshi as a great prophet, and every "major event" that happens related to bitcoin was predicted by the Great Satoshi himself, and every time something bad happens to bitcoin (some government illegalizes it) it's called a "Satoshi Crisis" and Satoshi gave us all the tools needed to deal with it appropriately.
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:07:25
He gave them breaking news for more than half a year, of course he would win the "Guardian person of the year 2013". All those other people on the list of nominees were there to make it look less pointless.

What will we do when the price will be millions of USD for a single Satoshi ? (Hyperinflation of USD + Hyperdeflation of BTC)
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:07:53
But it's a legit question. If the cost of BTC keeps going up exponentially, eventually a single satoshi will have a significant value. Even without caring about USD, a satoshi will eventually be worth enough value to buy some goods right? What do we do when we need a transaction of less than a satoshi?
@_date: 2013-09-03 19:57:19
Or people like you who dont get references
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:45:59
That argument makes sense to me. But let's forget about USD. Imagine the whole world suddenly adopts BTC, and every transaction is now done with bitcoins.
The 21 quadrillion satoshis will eventually all be mined so the supply of currency will pretty much stop for all intents and purposes. Some people will lose their wallets and their bitcoins, so that 21 quadrillion satoshis will actually decrease as time go by. Every time a satoshi is lost the value of all other satoshis go up a little (at least that's how I understand it?) so on a long enough time scale, does it make sense that satoshis will have more and more value? What do we do when a single satoshi has too much value?
Of course I understand that practically, these 21 quadrillions satoshis will take ages to be lost, I'm talking theoretically what would we do in a scenario where some rich dude decided to acquire a significant quantity of bitcoins just to take them off the market, making every satoshi so much more valuable?
