And yet that "worthless fiat scam paper" is the only reason why it means anything.
No fiat currency = no bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:58:08
Yeah? how do you buy bitcoin again?
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:16:54
Yes, it can, but the USD isn't losing value.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:14:28
Yes, because of inflation. As the purchasing power goes down, people on average have more money.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:39:52
That's why I don't talk about my bitcoin.
I had a very significant amount of bitcoin that I sold at $19.5k and just bought back at $10.5k, yet the only person I have talked to about it is my girlfriend.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:26:24
Yes but physically people have a larger number of dollars
Just stop, you have absolutely no clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:41:20
No that's just called inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:01:56
You have a lower than 5th grade understanding of how money works.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:02:15
Just wondering, but if bitcoin really does die, what will you think looking back on this comment?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:42:12
USD doesn't suddenly drop by 50%
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:52:51
I mean it's not broken, and that sounds a bit silly, so I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:47:06
No, but I'm pointing out that acting as if no matter what bitcoin will rise, as if you have some secret knowledge, is a bit irrational.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:53:33
Honestly I'm not some shining example of how to do bitcoin, I was risky and probably stupid and it paid off
We're talking hundreds of thousands. I bought in at low six figures months ago when bitcoin was at around $4.5k
Also not trying to brag, in fact usually I'm the opposite, which is why I mentioned how much of an impact bitcoin has had on me and how even with that I don't talk to people about it because I don't want to influence irl people into buying in based on my words and it possibly going badly for them.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:02:56
By a group of people whose sole job is to do just that, that know what they're doing, and have done it successfully for over a hundred years
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:08:47
Yes but you can obtain it more easily.
Each dollar going down in value is meaningless on it's own.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:23:58
What do you even mean by "going nowhere soon"
As in they're stable and won't see a sudden increase in value? yeah that's kind of the point, they're meant to be consistent and reliable with small changes over a long period of time.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a gamble. They're like buying gold but if it was really volatile
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:45:56
I sold at $19.5k.
I plan on buying back in, should I do it right now or do you guys think it will go lower?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:22:17
Do you even know what the alternative is with not bailing them out?
Either way, that has nothing to do with inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:54:39
Yes but the buying power hasn't changed much relative to inflation.
the USD is very stable
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:41:07
Something better could come around making bitcoin useless.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:17:37
Okay but factually bitcoin is a gamble. Factually there is a sizable chance that it doesn't even get back to $20k ever.
I personally wouldn't be surprised if it hit $100k at the end of the year, but I also KNOW that there is a chance it never does. It's not my opinion, it's a fact.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:52:00
How much will the electricity cost to mine to make that?
Also how much will it reduce the lifetime of your PC?
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:53:01
Yes, anonymously to anonymous people.
Not sure why you took it as boasting, sorry your feelings were hurt.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:05:37
Yes and there isn't a fixed number of dollars
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:16:27
If by several decades you mean like 100 years, sure.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:42:36
It's not on a downwards trend, it's just that inflation exists.

What a good reason to not hodl

Really it depends on the pet store
