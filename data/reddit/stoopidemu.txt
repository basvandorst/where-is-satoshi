My SO and I just moved in together and we are already talking about getting a fourth bookshelf.

The ability to purchase things isn't what makes a currency powerful.

If that is the case, be ready to sell when BCH collapses. It will come back down to its real price which is anywhere between 1900 and 2700.

So is there uncertainty now or not?

You can absolutely sell the highway system though. It can be privatized and people would pay for access. I don't think it is a very good idea but it can absolutely be done.

What a great use of money you were already spending. Good luck to you!

Yeah this is a bad presentation of the idea. Usually it is presented as a community getting together to purchase the car, a local government purchasing a fleet of cars, or a wealthy philanthropist buying the cars and setting up the ownership structure in a way that it is as if the cars owned themselves. 
The idea of a car owning itself doesn't rely on bitcoin but it does rely on blockchain contracts. Paul Vigna and Michael Casey go into this more indepth in their book "The Age of Cryptocurrency" which is a great read. It took me from BitCoin skeptic to Blockchain enthusiast.
