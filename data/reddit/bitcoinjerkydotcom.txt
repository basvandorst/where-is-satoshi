Just so everyone knows I sent OP a full refund and my sincerest apologies! Blew it hard on this one - working hard to be better.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:33:56
The main point is that the software available to people is using it, and we had to work around that.
I would have used something like bitcoinaverage from the beginning, but I wanted the storefront to match the backend payment processing for obvious reasons.
edit: in addition - everyone else using that plugin is getting bad pricing right now, and many of them probably have no idea of an alternative or even how to implement it.
I just wanted to make people aware of some of the effects of something like this that may be less obvious to people.

That's awesome I am jealous!
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:29:51
That's not the business I'm referring to, bitcoinjerky.com is a side thing


@_date: 2014-03-22 18:29:26
Hey I just sent you an e-mail - very sorry for the non responsiveness I was travelling on business and had no idea we were even getting any orders.
Ready and willing to make it right ASAP get back to me by e-mail!
Thanks and sorry again!
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:10:40
You are correct!
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:48:41
Back in December, I overhead people talking about it daily. Was thrilled whenever someone asked me about it, but it died down for a while. I have the feeling we are entering another period of popularity.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:26:19
Thank you for considering + bidding. I am also confused as to how flippa determines the end of the auction, but I am thrilled that people are willing to pay over $2k for the site!
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:09:56
tldr: coupon code "forsale"
link to auction to buy the site [here](
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:23:08
Please email support and I'll put them together for you
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:17:49
Agreed, there just needs to be more focus on creating these plugins and differentiating sources of information. I think it actually has a huge effect on bitcoin's future as a whole to make it easier for people to start bitcoin based businesses.
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:08:15
Just wanted to say your videos are great - on par with legit animation studios
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:24:57
Let me see what I can do...
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:57:36
Please PM me your order number and I'll look into it for you
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:17:19
I know, I know! Harder than it looks to accomplish - as soon as I figure it out it'll be there
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:12:04
Made you up a coupon code: Reallybruh
25% off your whole order
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:02:25
Yes, will ship to Canada - flat rate of $13
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:55:04
Not all - we don't!
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:39:49
PM your order # and I will tell you the order status, if you are the order I think you are everything looks good and it is confirmed.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:35:51
I go over the incoming payments and the unconfirmed orders each day - if it takes longer than an hour and still shows as unpaid I will manually confirm the order as paid, so no worries there.
edit: thanks for the purchase btw!
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:15:35
I feel weird saying that publicly, I will say I've sold more than $500 worth of jerky today and I am stoked about it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:16:34
Social media in general and word of mouth - it certainly helps that bitcoin has been receiving a ton of attention lately. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:33:57
Sorry about that, the flat rate is a great deal if you order a few bags at once!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:00:42
A few different brands and constantly adding more!
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:23:10
I will have some soon!
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:42:00
Thank you for your suggestion, I have added a contact us page: 
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:57:47
I will definitely be adding sample packs. Would you rather all different flavors for a single brand, or like a mix of the same flavor from multiple brands?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:43:39
You're right - just fixed it!
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:21:36
I flipped the switch on bitpay payments on my Shopify store  and within 24 hrs was featured on Shopify's blog and was receiving orders with customers paying in BTC.
Never expected it, very awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:22:47
I've watched the process, it is awesome but yea lots of work. I am stoked to try it!
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:55:51
I want to hire you to make a killer jerky themed illustrated banner to put atop [bitcoinjerky.com]( PM me if interested
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:27:49
My main business is as a wholesale supplier of housewares - so I wanted to give retail a try and see how it goes. No plans yet, but so far it is going better than expected.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:57:24
If you need some jerky, PM me and I might be able to uncover a hidden discount code ;)
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:13:10
Not yet - do you have a favorite brand? Would love to get some.
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:12:53
I'm on it - thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:33:26
That's actually a great idea, some of that stuff is delicious I'll find a source!
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:30:24
It's beautiful, would buy
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:37:36
Just added international shipping!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:27:16
That sounds so good, venison is so delicious I need to find some ASAP.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:58:57
Ah! I blew it!
Will work on international shipping next.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:33:57
Bacon jerky, got it!
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:13:56
I would love for some reviews to start popping up!
I will see what I can do to refine the rating system, and as we expand into more types of jerky better organize them.
Dog Jerky is a good idea, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:56:45
Thanks for the heads up - I need to add a bitcoin accepted here banner!
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:27:54
Adding some soon!
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:43:32
To make a long story short....yes
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:13:57
From the looks of that website that stuff can't be bad - sent off an e-mail about buying wholesale can't wait to try it. thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:54:46
Bitcoin Jerky takes dem coins
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:13:33
If you start to go commercial let me know - I'll buy!
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:23:03
I like this idea - we're still so new that there really isn't enough to show anything meaningful, but I will work on presenting some data in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:37:54
Yes, I will ship anywhere. It is a flat rate of $13 because that is roughly what it will cost me for the average order.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:29:51
I have some sitting in the office waiting to be loaded up - will be adding it soon and hopefully finding more types to buy
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:20:46
Yes I will ship anywhere!
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:12:32
Thanks we love you!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:37:24
Thanks, I am adding more brands and types, I've gotten a lot of feedback asking for certain things that I don't have yet. But it's new and will take some time (buying all that inventory is expensive!) There are many ways to increase the efficiency of fulfilling orders - the software tools available to online retailers are really great. That said, packing and shipping orders still takes time and is not the most exciting work in the world!
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:02:00
Hey guys I'd love to hear your suggestions, especially your favorite brands I should carry.
If you have any issues with anything please let me know, I'm here working on it and want to iron out any bugs!
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:52:09
I am currently having a mod to the cart software created that will show the up to date BTC conversion price as well as $ - surprisingly this is not as easy as it sounds. Should be up and running in a few days!
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:31:03
I would love if my suppliers accepted bitcoin - would make things a whole lot easier!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:38:10
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:05:16
Well to be perfectly honest, as far as I can tell every ad I have ever paid for has been a waste of money and has produced little to no sales.
