My personal opinion is that credit cards shouldn't be used at all, they aren't good for household economies. We should only spend money we have, not become slaves to banks because we wanted to buy something we can't actually afford..
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:32:28
Im fairly certain that even on Expedia if I were to have used a credit or debit card I would have had to wait at least 24-48 hours to receive my refund. 
Here is someones personal experience with Expedia: 
You can search and find many others, you can also call their customer service they will tell you its at least 24-48 hours if not a week..
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:00:00
Sorry I don't use PayPal at all.. I try to stay far far away from them. When using traditional payment processors they maybe able to issue an "instant credit", technically, but they never do, I have never ever, experienced it. I only pay with debit, as I don't like credit, and most people in the world don't have credit either. So when an amount gets debited from your bank account through an online debit purchase, if you want a refund, it will take at LEAST 48 hours.. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:11:21
Both of those required your intervention and communicating with the card company. They weren't simple refunds executed by the merchant.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:59:37
Try logging into coinbase first, then visiting GDAX.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:17:08
Well it seems to me that bitcoin has some added incentive to merchants for them to even offer immediate refunds. As I haven't seen it with any of my debit transactions ever.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:37:03
Many people in this world can't even get credit cards..
EDIT: Also it is not that every time you use a credit card you get refunded immediately..
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:49:20
Seriously... everyone who needs to get a refund is a "..compulsive indecisive idiot"...
Ok Im not conversing with you anymore..
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:26:37
For one yes, if you max out your credit card.
For two, most people in the world don't have credit cards. They use debit cards, and when using debit cards it is real money you spend, and may need to use for something else within those 24-72 hours, heck, I have even had to wait more than two weeks sometimes to get a refund back to my bank account from a debit purchase.
Yes getting my money back instantly, felt pretty darn good.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:26:50
Give me one example of someone paying online with a credit card or debit card and being able to have it instantly refunded back to the card.
EDIT: In regards to re-usage of an address, there is no rule "You should never reuse an address", I don't give a crap about anonymity, I have nothing to hide, reusing addresses are not a problem in my book. Also for Expedia to keep from being accused of sending the funds to a wrong address it is in their best interest to send it back to where it came.
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:06:53
Please explain to me how address re-usage hurts security, how it gives miners more power, and how it makes the network more centralized. In detail.. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:22:55
Im talking about a merchant site, not a site of a financial company providing services.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:08:23
I don't have a credit card now, doesn't mean I have never had one... And yes it does take 24 -48 hours.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:10:09
Actually its a credit limit, which means it has a limit, a finite supply,  and until you pay your bill, the limit can remain exhausted like a regular bank account. What if the purchase was with a debit card.. or what if the purchase was for an amount larger than what you have in your bank account (hence the reason to use a credit card) then what would you do.. 
This argument of, oh if your credit limit is reached then just spend your cash from the bank account, is completely avoiding the point that you cannot get an instant refund from an online retailer using credit or debit, but you can get an instant refund with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:37:44
Yes I did make a mistake in my OP, I forgot a step. I added it with an edit, please see. I apologize for the confusion
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:35:06
Obviously Im talking about purchasing goods, not gift cards.
Edit: And are you talking about using credit/debit to purchase an Amex gift card and getting a refund for such said card, when you choose not to use it?
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:18:41
Well at least a company is willing to embrace this policy with bitcoin, because I have never seen it embraced with debit or credit. Seems to me that there is less risk for the company to issue immediate bitcoin refunds, than to do so with debit or credit. I would venture to say more companies will adopt this policy if they have not already.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:47:50
There are plenty of ways to get bitcoins, and bitcoins are divisible, so a person can purchase only a fraction of bitcoins.. Or what if the person is paid in bitcoins..

Same billing cycle! My gosh, Im talking about seconds here, not same billing cycle.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:24:10
You are correct, its not a direct feature, but because of bitcoin's nature, this ability of immediate refunds seems to be to be possible where before with debit transactions it was not. So I attribute this feature to bitcoin, as I have never experienced it with any other payment type.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:56:53
Thank you for pointing these things out.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:19:02
Yes I know, if you can see my edit, Expedia uses Coinbase, and they sent the refund btc to my email I used to book the hotel. It was then refunded to my Coinbase account associated with that email. I subsequently sent it to my local wallet. Sounds long but it all hapened so fast I even forgot that Coinbase was involved at all.
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:21:21
I didn't use a web wallet to make the purchase, so they refunded the money back through Coinbase. I had the then claim it from my Coinbase account and transfer back to my local wallet.
EDIT: BIP70 sounds like a pretty good idea. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:51:31
Your wrong.. If I only have $500 left in credit and I buy plane tickets with it, I cannot use that $500 anymore.. If I ask for a refund then it may be reflected back into my account within 24-48 hours, only then can I use it again.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:01:21
They returned the btc back to the address I sent it from. 
EDIT: No they didn't ask or give any option of choosing a different address.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:30:46
I would like to see an example of an online debit transaction being refunded instantly, i.e. flight or hotel booking for example, or some other service that doesn't require you to ship a physical item back. Please point to a site that provides this. I just want one practical example. I don't accept anything PayPal provides..
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:17:10
Please then give me a link to one, just one website, where you have gotten instant refunds to your credit or debit card... that all I ask, just one site.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:44:13
Perhaps when you are returning a physical good to a physical store, you may get credit back to your credit card or debit, but this practice I have never witnessed with online transactions. They always say 24-48 hours (exlcuding weekends), in my experience it is always much longer. In any case seconds is much much faster than 24-48 hours.
@_date: 2014-10-22 06:37:36
Well I don't have a credit card, so instant buy is out of the question anyways. Can Celery be trusted? can you link me to any positive user experience?
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:18:41
Amex gift cards, they are not a website. To a website, it is just a credit/debit card.

Thats good to know!
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:24:21
Your points are all valid too. :)
Yes, it seems like someone would have to act fast to prove theft of stolen funds, and have that proof accepted, then have the address propagated through all the nodes before the thief transfers them somewhere else or mixes them.
But some malware may use a single address for a long period of time, those addresses could be blocked. Or a stupid thief that just keeps his stolen goods in one place.
I just wish there was some system of marking BTC as stolen, that wouldn't be able to be abused, and would be accepted by all the nodes.
I don't know how that would be implemented, or if it could even be implemented... anyways. Im sure someone will come up with something in the future.
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:39:47
True. Perhaps the only solution is more secure wallets that are easily to use for the layman.

Hahah. funny. really.... seriously..
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:03:30

It could easily be coded to implement a gradual change in block reward, and be strong code. It would still meet the original halving markers, which would equate to the same distribution rate that there is now, so that would not change, it would just be gradual and not abrupt, lending to less volatility. So your reply still does not satisfy my question.
@_date: 2014-12-14 10:33:00
Just put zero's

They also have a better fee structure than Coinapult, Bitreserve is only .45%, vs Coinapults 1%, the spread also seems tighter on bitreserve than Coinapult.
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:34:02
I total get your point, but I still think that the more we can smoothen out the bitcoin protocol, and reduce the things that hinder adoption, the better we will be. Volatility is a hinderance to adoption, and the concept of abrupt halving adds to volatility. If we could implement gradual halving I think this would help to a great degree to control future volatility that would surround the halving periods.
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:05:53
So what your saying is that Satoshi added abrupt halving specifically to keep people on their toes so to say, and that volatility is good because it causes people to pay attention.
I thought we wanted a stable bitcoin ecosystem, not just "attention".
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:16:48
So you are suggesting that someone would steal btc and send them to an address they do not control just to tarnish the reputation of the owner of that address?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:12:50
Funny after I posted this I noticed 5 other post about the same thing... :)
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:11:07
Well there would have to be some proof that there was theft of course, then consensus to add the destination address to the list, then propagated to all the nodes.
I agree, but nothing is fool proof, there will always be a way to steal, and there will be accidents. Thieves will become more and more clever, especially as bitcoin grows in adoption.
@_date: 2014-12-01 09:10:57
Had awful experience with Circle, took 5 days to tell me they couldn't process the transaction. Blocked my accounts for no good reason, shitty customer support. Told them to delete my account, and they replied they would delete it, but the information on my account would remain.. total crap, now they eternally have all my bank account and address information stored on their servers and refuse to delete it.
Edit: So no.. I shall not appreciate a shitty service.

You seem to think that you know me, and have decided that I do not have any knowledge of CS. You don't know what my education is or what my professional background is. How you can magically conclude that is beyond me. I am not going to scan my Computer Science degree and send to you nor do I feel obliged to send you my CV, who are you that I need to prove myself to.
In your original reply all you said that was directly pertaining to my question was, "Too complex, too risky, and not necessary." That was not satisfying to me, the rest of your reply was simply talking about distribution, which my question about smooth reward shrinking, has no affect on. The explanation in the BitcoinTalk thread was more along the lines of something I was looking for in a reply. Still then that thread showed that it was possible and simple to code.
My desire of the addition of smooth reward adjustment has nothing to do with "aesthetics", it is to help with volatility, and adoption. You also seem to just assume that I wasn't around for the previous halving. The bitcoin ecosystem then was totally different, we cannot compare what will happen in the future to what happened then.
Honestly I haven't sat down to try and code anything in regards to this issue, I figured I would ask around first and see if there was some actual reasoning behind these abrupt halves. If I could not find anything convincing enough then the next step would be to see if it is an idea people would be interested in, if so, then write the code. Why waste my time first.
My original enquiry was that I wanted to know why Sathosi coded it that way, I now have that answer. Im satisfied in that regard. Although I still know it is possible to have a more gradual system that would be universally compatible on all machines. It just a matter of doing it, the extra computation it would take is nothing in comparison to the rest of the code, especially with todays computers.
The only issue is consensus. Some like you think there is no problem, that the miners will anticipate, the market will adjust, and life will go on. Could be. But it also could cause a big disturbance. If we can solve that, then why not.
Andresen is already suggesting a fork, why not try to think of everything that we may want in a possible fork and do it once and be finished with it. 
EDIT: Spelling

But this was dealers, not Benthall himself. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:03:12
My concern is why did Sathosi implement abrupt halving, if a gradual system could have been implemented. Abrupt halving will in fact affect miners, and exchange prices, in the short term. Of course long term everything smoothens out, but these short-term "disruptions" cause a problem for adoption.
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:20:51
Well I have nothing to do with Voorhees, don't know him at all, so my post about blacklisting was a question, a discussion topic. It wasn't a "We have to have blacklisting!", in any case this post was simply me posting about something I like, I have nothing to do with Coinapult. Im just a user sharing my experience. The two posts have nothing to do with each other except they are both from me.. Anyways if you paint all posts by somebody as useless because you didn't like another of their posts.. well that is kind of childish.
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:27:22
Volatility may be natural, sure, but abrupt halving is not, and I feel unnecessarily adds to the volatility, when a gradual system could achieve the same affect.

Average block generation time is ten minutes but can also be one minute, or thirty minutes.
A lot of the time the average is actually below ten minutes:
Edit: And if you put a good fee, then you have a pretty darn good chance of your transaction being included in the next block, if not then surely the second block after that as your transaction is marked as aged. Still the OP was talking about 60 minute to 24 hr confirmation times. Way to long.

I second . I have had horrible experience with their .cn site's responsiveness, and lag / not working. This inadvertently caused me to miss many opportunities for profit because when I would click the order or sell button nothing.. I mean nothing would happen. I would then refresh the page, and maybe it would load the page and maybe not, once it loaded it may or may not work even then. And the load time on the page was horrendous, they really need to spend some of their profits upgrading their servers.
Needless to say I left after two days of trading there, it was too frustrating to deal with such site lag and unresponsiveness. In a rapidly changing environment like bitcoin trading you need to be able to move fast.. Okcoin.cn's web ui definite doesn't meet to those standards.
Now if I had found a suitable program like QT Bitcoin trader I would have tried their API, but I found no such alternative that would work with their API, I would either have to write something myself, or buy some bot.. which I wasn't willing to do either.
So Im back to Bitfinex.

Sure, but let us say right now our average world temperature halves, that would be pretty drastic, but we could tolerate, the second halving would put even more stress on many forms of life. Gradual change in temperature could give time for an ecosystem to adapt, abrupt changes usually cause catastrophe. What to speak of if the temperature doubled, we would all die. :)
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:53:52
I also find your remark "Enjoy fixing bitcoin for us", very naive. You think bitcoin is perfect as it is, and that there was never anything that needed to be improved upon.
You think the lead bitcoin developer that is suggesting a hard fork thinks bitcoin is perfect and doesn't need any "fixing" at all, no he doesn't think that, he thinks that there are things that need "fixing". So please give me a break.
In the life span of bitcoin there have been many issues addressed in the code and "fixed".

Look.. Bitstamp announced the need for verification over a year ago.. this has been a long time coming. Don't make it seem like all of a sudden, they have been giving updates periodically.
When I created my account a few months ago I was not able to deposit anything, BTC or Fiat until I was verified. Verification was simple took less than a day.
Only legacy accounts that were created over a year ago had the ability to deposit BTC without verification. Those are the accounts that are requiring verification.
If you were foolish enough to ignore their messages requiring verification for a year then you deserve to get your funds seized...

@_date: 2014-11-09 04:44:58
Seems to me like the customers are not including a miners fee if it takes longer than 10 minutes for a confirmation, otherwise one confirmation takes only 10 minutes or less, and you can be %99 sure that after one confirmation others will follow.
I would suggest that you tell the customers to include a miners fee, or their transaction will be delayed.
Edit: You can use blockchain.info's blackchain explorer to immediately see if a miners fee was included in an unconfirmed transaction, that way you can tell your customer.. look you didn't include a miners fee your transaction will have to wait. Also if you see that a miners fee was included you can "safely" assume that the transaction will be confirmed, and even deliver your product with zero-confirmation.
@_date: 2014-10-08 09:38:02
Sure ok. Now let us apply that to Bitcoin. If you knew beforehand a bitcoin "iceage" was coming what would you do?
If I was on Earth and I had prior knowledge of an impending global climate change I would take some drastic measures to protect myself.
EDIT: Also you could equate volatility with drastic change. Why is that a good thing? Don't we want stable gradual growth of the bitcoin ecosystem, that seems to be the most healthiest option. Otherwise drastic changes could prove fatal, or at the least severely disabling.

Im an ex-pat living in India and there are many many bitcoin buyers on LocalBitcoins.com that pay using IMPS, NEFT, and the money is in your bank account fast. The buyers give good prices too. I have sold there, and was very pleased, money was transferred to my account within an hour. You can also sell large amounts of bitcoins no problem.
Because in India we are able to transfer money between banks pretty much instantly. No three to five day wait like in the USA. 
The only problem is purchasing bitcoins in India, prices are steep and supply is limited.

Stable block subsidy for 4 years is not volatile, but abrupt halving is. In late 2012 bitcoin was not what it is now. Today the market, network and margins are a whole different beast all together, you will see in 2016 what I am talking about, you can set a reddit reminder of this post :)
@_date: 2014-10-08 10:41:54
In the long term no it would not, but for those periods before and after halving points, there would be a lot of volatility. Abrupt halving just seems to add unnecessary "waves" in the bitcoin ecosystem if gradual decreasing could be coded instead.

I never said I was "hot shit", nor did I say bitcoin was "broken", nor did I even say I would be the one to code or implement the change.
Thank you for the bitcointalk thread link, it helped to answer some of my initial questions as to why Satoshi implemented in this way.
And according to that thread, as I said it would be, it is trivial to code gradual reward changing, but as others also said the halving algorithm is more precise using a binary shift.
I still think a gradual reward change that could even coincide with each retarget, will help future stability during those halving markers.
But thank you for helping to find answers to my questions. But no thanks for your attitude.

A second thought though is what about blacklisting known theft addresses, i.e. destination addresses that stolen funds have ended up in. This would help to deter thieves from being able to spend their stolen BTC.
Just a thought.

Of course but in general discussion when someone asks about confirmation time we say 10 minutes like you said this is average, so why make the discussion more complicated.
For discussion you can simply say average time is 10 minutes. Typically it doesn't take longer, if so then not much longer, only rare occasions has it been dramatically longer than 10 minutes.
EDIT: Specifically the OP was mentioning 60 minutes, 24 hours, etc. those are not normal times for 1 confirmation.

Proof would surely be a more difficult burden for the single user, but proof would be easy for large organizations that are victims of theft.
Consensus would be with the node operators that the proof of theft is genuine.
I don't know how this could efficiently be implemented though, I just wanted to hear some other peoples ideas on the possibility.
I think in the long term the better solution would be more secure ways to store our funds, ways that are easy for a layman, and that are more resistant to user ignorance.

Well there would have to be some proof that there was theft of course, then consensus to add the destination address to the list.
How could the stolen coins move out of the blacklisted address to be spent, if it was not done by the thief himself?
Unless your speaking in terms of a theoretical situation where someone steals coins deposits them in his address, then immediately sells them to a "good actor" on localbitcoins, or similar place, before the original address could be blacklisted, well in those situations we can see what law enforcement would do with stolen goods. If I stole your laptop, and sold it to a "nice person" and the police found the laptop with this "nice person", the police would confiscate the laptop, even if the "nice person" paid for it.
Similarly we should also have some system in place in the bitcoin community so that theft is deterred, blacklisting, more due diligence when purchasing bitcoins from someone we don't know. I know if some random guy cam up to me on the street and said "Hey I got this really cheap laptop, you wanna buy it?" I would be worried it was stolen and not buy it. So we should also feel the same way with bitcoin.
Just some thoughts.

So you would suggest the average joe use a wallet on their computer, the same computer that they use to visit malware infected sites, and download key loggers that will install on their systems and compromise their software wallets... Or would you suggest a Trezor.. that requires a (possibly infected) computer to transfer funds to and from to a hot wallet.
These options are not realistic for the average everyday user. They need something more secure, easy to use, that is idiot proof.
This is why we don't have the level of adoption we need right now. There is a fundamental lack of secure easy to use wallet implementations out there. Any of the good ones use some sort of centralization, because secure servers that backup your information are much more trusted than the average user. The average user will get his information stolen, lost or destroyed somehow. This is why "cloud" services are so popular.
If the keys are encrypted on their servers with only information you have to decrypt them then their is no problem.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:21:49
The problem is when a bank lends out a percentage of its users funds (fractional reserve), and those debts default, the user is out a percentage of their funds, if many loans default, as have happened in the past, the institution holding the funds can collapse, and leave you high and dry with nothing. That is the problem.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:03:54
So you expect an average non-computer savvy user to be able to maintain secure back-ups of their private keys, on USB drives and paper wallets.. 
That is totally unacceptable for the everyday user. Bitcoin will never go mainstream that way, people want someone they can trust more than themselves. They need a way they can securely store their encrypted keys online so they don't have to worry about losing them.
In fact the layman user shouldn't even have to worry about what a private key is. At most all he should have to remember is a password and perhaps a secondary method of validation, fingerprint, phone sms, etc.
Right now all the layman has to do is swipe and type a pin number in (credit &amp; debit). If bitcoin is more complicated than that and requires the user to manage his own keys to his vault of money, it will never fly. That is why banks exist in the first place. People don't trust themselves to securely store their own money.
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:25:04
But what if I break into your house and steal your USB drive, or the paper with your seed that you have stored in your safe. Or worse what if your house burns down, with paper and usb drive inside.
So many things can happen. The regular mom and pop user or layman cannot trust himself to keep his funds secure, and he knows that. The user that has confidence will use back-ups of his seed in various places, but those people are not the masses. The masses need help.
EDIT: I have had USB's suddenly fail on me also.. 
EDIT2: What if the computer you use to have the HD wallet becomes compromised by visiting malicious sites and install malware or key loggers.. then your back-ups are useless..
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:40:37
And you think banks do.. In many countries of the world "regulated" banks have gone bankrupt and clients lost money. Trust does not equal regulation.

The beauty of bitcoin is that if you don't want to trust a third party, you don't have to. Although there should be options available for those who want to trust a third party with their security, and I feel most people are more comfortable trusting a third party.

@_date: 2015-01-21 08:24:27
Pretty much you have your own bank with bitcoin, but you have the option to store the keys to that bank with yourself or with a trusted third party. 
The choice is yours. But it is your bank, and it is not fractionally reserved. 
Your reserves are fully there, in your own digital vault.
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:23:50
Then you don't have to buy one. You can store your BTC however you want. Their hardware wallet is nice, the best I've seen so far (besides the fingerprint only part), this wallet will help adoption.
If you want to invest and make something better then go for it. That would be awesome. In the meantime, don't knock somebody for trying to make a strong secure easily usable bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:59:37
They use HD wallets.

Trust is exactly right, and for most people they, themselves, are the number one person they cannot trust.
We live in a world where people realize this, and use "cloud" storage to store data they don't want to lose.
In the case of money they don't want to just lose their hard earned money, so they store it with someone they trust more than themselves, the banks (even though they shouldn't trust the banks).
Until a truly decentralized trust-less system of encrypted storage of information is implemented, we will need to rely on partially centralized solutions.
Bitcoin is money, not just baby pictures, and needs much more than just "cloud" storage or a software wallet on your computer. The average person should not have to back-up their HD seed on multiple methods of storage (paper, USB) and stash them various places. This is unrealistic for the average user. No way bitcoin will succeed unless we have an easy to use, secure, user-proof wallet.
Im not advocating anyone to buy anything, I'm simply stating that Case is a step in the right direction, I like it.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:06:04
Your exactly right... it seems people are missing the point. Of course the banks are corrupt and keeping fractional reserves, we can fix that with bitcoin, but we still need to solve this issue of people not trusting themselves with their own money.
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:04:06
What about a credit union?
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:24:21
The point I make further down the comment chain is that if a user has a sole private key, or the majority a of the private keys in 3 signature wallet. Then the burden of securely maintaining those keys is with them.
The user is the number one person to not be trusted. They will lose their information, get it stolen, or destroyed. This is why most people trust a third party with their wealth, because they don't trust themselves to secure it.
Most people trust third parties because they know they, themselves, are incompetent, especially when it comes to backing up sensitive data, i.e. the popularity of cloud storage solutions.
I make sure I have back-ups of my encrypted HD seeds for my wallets on secure servers with daily back-ups, because it's not that I don't trust myself, but I don't trust my computer to not just die on me one day, which is totally reasonable. What if my usb drives with my back-ups fail, or my paper back-ups get destroyed or stolen.
Server based back-up solutions are a good options to securely store sensitive information, and people understand this, as long as the information that is stored is encrypted with information only you have knowledge of.
If a user feels they are smart enough to handle large sums of money by securely stashing private keys or HD seeds here &amp; there. Then they are, by all means, total able to do so with various other wallet implementations out there. 
For those that can't trust themselves (99% of the general public) the implementation that Case gives with server based storage of encrypted keys is better for the masses.
Now if Case gives an option to have access to the other two keys for those that feel confident in securing their own wealth, then that would be even better, but then those people that are confident don't need this wallet implementation anyways, they can handle secure storage and back-up themselves already.
We need to understand this hardware wallet is not for the bitcoin enthusiast that can maintain backups and secure his own funds. This is for the general public that doesn't even have to know what the hell a private key is if they don't want to.
My only critique of the device is if they could have a pin code required as well as a fingerprint swipe, to prevent fingerprint spoofing. They could also implement a locking mechanism after a certain number a failed attempts to access the device, requiring the user to contact Case.
If we want a solution similar to this but not dependent on centralized servers we will need to wait until a truly decentralized trust-less system of encrypted storage of information is implemented.
Until then, for the masses, centralized, secure, encrypted, server based storage of the majority of a 2 of 3 multi-sig HD wallet sounds good to me, as long as the two keys are stored on separate servers (which they are for Case's wallet implementation), and as long as the information required to decrypt the private key is not stored on the same server as the key itself. 
I would not want to leave the burden of securing my grandmothers wealth to herself, that is not realistic, otherwise everybody would already just keep giant safes in their house and secure their own cash, but they don't.
I feel this hardware wallet is very nice step in the right direction for mass adoption. It is user friendly and easy to use, and the burden of securing the majority of the keys is with a third party, yes, but people want this. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:16:18
Most exchanges pool everyones BTC into hot and cold wallets that can be hacked and swept. This is different to having your own personal encrypted private key stored on a server with only information you have to unlock the key. The server will surely maintain daily back-ups, so if their server fails they can restore, and if the server is compromised by a malicious hacker, then the hacker cannot do anything with an encrypted private key without the information to decrypt it. 
EDIT for grammar 
@_date: 2015-01-20 15:00:21
If you research a little better the two private keys they hold are both encrypted with only information you know/have. The first is your fingerprint, the second is security questions you set with them. So even if the encrypted fingerprint private key (which is hot, on their live server) is compromised, it is still unusable without the device and your fingerprint. The third key is on the device itself. 
The second key they hold is offline in cold storage, also encrypted. 
The security of the wallet implementation itself is sound the only drawback is if the only security method required to send BTC is your fingerprint, which can be spoofed, I wish they had an opt-in to have a two factor method of authentication, perhaps fingerprint and password.
@_date: 2015-01-21 14:01:35
Thats why the clueless average user should be using a system that is more secure than a simple encrypted single private key. HD is one step forward, but even more is a system of multi-sig where one private key is embedded in a hardware wallet that is destroyed when someone attempts to be open the case, the second key is an encrypted HD wallet securely stored on a server where the password is a special hash of the users fingerprint plus a pin code, practically impossible to brute-force, unless I physically attack you and force you through torture to give up your pin code, and the third key is encrypted with a special hash of security questions that you setup and stored on a server. All three keys are located in different places. Sounds like a pretty good solution to me, and I never need to write down a HD seed or create a "strong" password. All I need to do is remember security questions, have my fingerprint, and remember a pin code. Simple, and strong. This is what is needed for mass user adoption.
EDIT: added "and stored on a server" describing the third key.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:59:07
I also hope they have a better option for the final product than "fingerprint only", fingerprint + password, would be nice. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:25:41
Sure, they could at least make it optional.
EDIT: Well many people are accustomed to using a pin with their debit cards, so a pin with a fingerprint shouldn't be too much more to ask from a user, or from Case
@_date: 2015-01-21 05:27:09
But most people don't trust themselves. This is the beauty of bitcoin you have the option to use and number of wallet implementations out there you want. You don't have to use this device.

Yes, the block-chain is irreversible, but that is one of the benefits, and downsides to decentralization. This provides freedom, no censorship, or big brother blocking this or that, this provides truly free market, free speech, full freedom to share anything without it being censored or taken down. 
So yes, there is a concern for what if some "illegal" matter is posted, nothing can be done, the authorities cannot shutdown the "system", its decentralized. This may be an attractive aspect for some; most people won't care, as they don't have random naked pictures of themselves or secrets they are hiding. 
This "problem" / "issue" will really only concern the governments, and they are already concerned about bitcoin for this very reason.. they cannot control it.. 
So take it as you will this is the price you must pay for true freedom.

Gemini was pretty fast in getting verified, and they give you a 500 dollar a day limit on ACH transfers at first, which is fine for most people. Also they reset the daily limit at 5pm EST so you can actually get 1000 if you purchase right before and right after the reset. Also one nice feature is you can purchase and trade BTC immediately upon initiating an ACH transfer, you don't have to wait for it to clear, only caveat is that you have to wait for the standard 4-5 days for the ACH to clear if you want to withdraw the BTC out of the exchange. One thing should be noted though, is that ALL btc withdrawals are blocked if you have any money that's pending ACH clearance converted to BTC. 
For example if I have a 10 btc balance on the exchange and I deposit $450 and exchange it for .5 btc, now I have a balance of 10.5 btc, and even though that other 10 btc has nothing to do with the recent .5 btc purchase, since the .5 btc was bought before the ACH transfer cleared, ALL btc withdrawals are blocked until the ACH clears, or if I convert enough btc back to 450 dollars, only then will I be able to withdraw my previous 10 btc.
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:35:58
No, they do not have debit / credit card options. With ACH though you can start trading instantly after initiating the transfer. You only have to wait for clearance to withdraw.

I just noticed that is not what they said in the blog post, but it is what they said in the email I just received with that blog post link at the bottom, so I assumed the blog post said the same thing. In the email they mention they may consider renaming B2X to bitcoin, but they wont at first.
Here is the email:
Dear GDAX Customer,
 
We wanted to remind you that the upcoming Bitcoin Segwit2x hard fork is projected to take place on November 16 and will result in two bitcoin blockchains.
 
Following the fork:
GDAX will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin with ticker BTC and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x with ticker B2X.
GDAX will disable deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) approximately 24 hours before the fork and re-enable 24-48 hours after the fork for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin2x (B2X).
GDAX will enable trading of both BTC and B2X within 4 hours of the fork.
Any customer storing Bitcoin (BTC) on GDAX at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the Bitcoin2x (B2X) asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain.
If the Bitcoin2x blockchain becomes the chain with the most accumulated difficulty, and the chains are in a stable state, we will consider renaming it to Bitcoin and send an additional communication at that time. We will consider other factors such as market cap, community support, etc to determine stability. We will start evaluating this 2 weeks after the fork.
For a detailed timeline of events surrounding the fork please see our blog post and FAQ.
 
Thank you,
GDAX Team
