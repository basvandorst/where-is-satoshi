You've literally listed 2 exchanges that don't do fiat to crypto and Gemini, which is unavailable in Europe and I had other problems with Bitstamp. But thank you very much for doing your research in advance.

Same thing, I have a problem where I can't get verified on GDAX, because I need to submit a second form of ID (Russian passport), whereas I previously registered using my Netherlands permit card. I don't want to change my region to Russia, because I imagine that would I affect how I can send funds from my SEPA bank account. Relied a month later redirecting me to the FAQ page. Does anyone know of a solution to this? Or will I still be able to transfer funds from my SEPA bank if I change my location to Russia?

What do I use as a European then?

You shouldn't be worried about that and look on the bright side (very bright side). Also, if your friends get resentful of your financial gains, reconsider your friends, not your investments

At the moment the transaction fees are extremely high. Go way over the price of the transaction itself. This is due to the congestion of the network, which Bitcoin was not prepared for.

True if big

Constant development in Bitcoin? Altcoins with a formal team and foundation roll out developments and updates bi-weekly or monthly. Bitcoin doesn't have an underlying foundation and has definitely not been "constantly" rolling out new features. 
Lightning Network was the biggest addition in a while and even so, it is not an improvement to the underlying Bitcoin code, it is a second-layer solution.

No transaction fees and instant transfer? I'm sorry but that doesn't sound like bitcoin

Saw one of those on a bin somewhere around Groningen too.
