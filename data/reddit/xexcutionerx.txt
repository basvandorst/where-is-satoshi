@_date: 2018-06-18 10:02:13
Ty sir. One more thing. Dumb it down please. 
Does bitcoin and bitcoin cash share this problem ? Do all pow crypto has this problem ? 
And lastly isnt mining done in realtime. I mean as soon as the block is validated it is updated for all. 
I did not understand when the article said that the selfish miner will not update the ledger(?) and the other people will be mining an already found block ? 
Please could you explain it to me. Sorry for this. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:29:00

No he said mid july he said wait a month extra
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:03:03
He did infact. It takes 7 hours to tell the story and the heartbreaking lies he told me. This is just a summary i could type. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 09:24:51
Well to be honest. I fell for the scam because i had blind trust on him. He ran a ponzi within his circle of friends. I invested 46k USD and then another friend came to me and said that hows it going as a sleeping partner of a scrap trading company. The profit margin was around 4% per month. Which seemed very very attractive. 
Again if it wasn’t him , i would’ve looked the other way but we were best friends for 16 years. I had always trusted him and vice versa. We had never made money an issue between us and we used to spend on each other also. 
Never in my life could i imagine that this guy would scam me for money.  
It turned out there was no business it was a ponzi. He had scammed another friend of mine at the same time as me. 
Money wasnt the priority. I kept pleading to him that just admit it and say you wont repeat it and you will turn into a new leaf. and i swear ill make some stuff up and hide your “ ponzi” 
and i”ll help you pay back people in anyway i can. But you need to admit. 
After that the real shit began. Turns out the guy had been lying to us for 16 years hahaha
-his dad isnt his dad
-lied about his wife
-he was on cocaine 
-lied about how he managed funds
-put the balme on his other parner for the ponzi while he had money still in the bank 
-10 more stuff cant put down all together
And that was that. I miss him and i love him and i still pray for him but fuck him. 
-1bro scamed 2nd
-2nd bro wanna give another chance
-1bro was never his bro
-2nd bro down 46kud  and a bro
But im in the process of recovering some of the money

Bitconnect is better than bch
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:02:07
Ok noob here i heard that btc can be infinitely devised. Right now it has x.xxxxxxx it can increase the the sotoshi amount ?
So one day 1 satishi=1 usd and they add 2 more zeros so that 1 satoshi will be 100 usd :/ cos we added 2 more decimal places with satoshis?
Im confused please im nOt fudding i just want to understand this better. 
@_date: 2019-09-01 19:21:49
The supply didnt increase. 
But that pizza”s feeding power increases as demand rises ! 
Since one slice used to feed 1 person now same volume of pizza can feed more because of deflated value as demand rises for the pizza. 
That makes it a bit unsettling
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:06:56
One last question sir. Ive also reqd somewhere by altering the code the total supply can increase or decrease ? Isnt that dangerous ?
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:25:17
Keep on commenting every1 is trolling please help him
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:24:19
which alts
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:05:53
So what you are saying is we never needed 21 million btc. 
Only 0.00000000000001 was enough because that too is devisable.
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:07:23
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:04:01
Coz i join the crypto cene in jan 2018. 
And now everything falls hahahahahhaah
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:06:47
Sir im sorry i meant that th current btc. Can its supply change ? Without a hardfork. Can it change supply with a softfork? So btc remains btc without a new coin.( but with a higher/lower supply)
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:35:57
U send money over the net. Peoples computer write ledger of this transaction. They get money for writing your transaction. Your money is send and received in the other wallet. 
Downvote me for many flaws but this is the most basic explanation i could think of 
@_date: 2018-07-13 00:20:01
How much was dodge when u bought it ?
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:23:02
Nice retarded markup
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:59:34
Thats why i feel uncomfortable at times. 
Then supply is really unlimited. 
A year ago i saw exchanges with trading stuff at 
0.00000025 (8 decimal) 
Now i see stuff trading at 
0.0000002576 (10 decimal) it means the same. Well almost but point is 
If btc really hit off then 0.000000000000000000001  btc could mean 1 usd ? 
Or even 10 if total world domination. 
Then isnt this unlimited supply ? Kinda like what the usd is doing
And im sorry ! If im ill informed !!
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:54:09
Are you from pakistan
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:35:20
Thank you for reinforcing my point of view. 
So you agree it’s exactly like the usd
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:05:51
Ok thank you. I get it. I really appriciate the input from you guys.  Thanks again. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:45:27
So if i had 1 sotoshi and the code is modified to add 2 decimal place i will still have 1 satoshi or 100 satoshi ? 
@_date: 2018-07-06 17:46:50
So just altering the code would not change the usd value right
@_date: 2018-07-06 08:44:15
So if 1 satoshi is 1 usd
Then they add 2 more decimal places. The. The value of the last 2 wont count as satoshi ? 
I mean 0.00000001 = 1 usd and if they add 2 more zeroes 
 then the value will still be 1 usd but be written like this ? 0.0000000100 ?
Is this correct ? But wouldnt this be 100 satoshi ? 
Or satoshie cannot surpass after eight decimal places ?
@_date: 2018-07-07 14:29:19
Thank you all for clearing my doubts. I appriciate it. Some people are spreading false info. If it was the other case its a sure shot scam. 
Thanks again. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:22:24
Ty sir for the detailed input. I really appriciate it.

My cousin works for sorry forgot the company name. They give out loans to banks and also trade commodities. The company is huge. He also trades on thier behalf makes a really good living. I thought a person of his caliber would rule day trading in crypto. As soon as i talked to him about it , he just said 1 thing : “TA doesnt apply to crypto” he said  for starters do this 
sync all the exchanges 
Make the deposit (fiat) easy and fast
Make people believe this is actually something ( only 3-10% of the world foes this right now ?)
Then we will talk. 
He said arbitrage and price manipulation are the bane here. If this is fixed to an extent TA would be much easier to predict. 
Basically this is a young space with a 18year old buying 1 btc worth of doge atm not because he wants to buy dodge.  Because he might have gotten 10 btc when they were around 100 usd.
