But yeah, your coinbase account is the same as your coinbase pro. It’s just a different platform but with the same credentials
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:11:13
I don’t know on mobile but there are two websites.
coinbase.com and pro.coinbase.com
Coinbase pro is the exchange previously known as GDAX and coinbase classic is just the platform where you can buy some coins and keep it on an online wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:48:51
May I recommand you to use coinbase pro instead of coinbase (there are lesser fees) and also to use at least a software wallet on your computer or your mobile phone instead of coinbase wallet.
To transfert your coins from coinbase to a wallet, use coinbase pro also.

I don’t have an android so maybe the others will be more helpful than me but it may depend.
If you go only bitcoin, I heard about green wallet and Samourai wallet.
Maybe also blue wallet but ‘m not sure it’s available on Android.

So if I understand well, my 12 words from Jaxx are not valid on any other platform. I have to transfer the coins and loose some in fees ?
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:53:38
Hello, thanks a lot for your answer. The reason I want to change is because since the change for jaxx liberty, I don't find it "user friendly" for me. I don't have any complains about jaxx, it's juste that I'm not really fond of it.

@_date: 2019-04-26 21:31:07
Thank you for all the details. I’ll check that !
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:35:28
No problem

Don't touch it, enjoy your vacation and buy again when you come back

On the ledger nano you have to put your seed on the ledger and not on your computer. I always thought it was the same for the trezor.
I also saw earlier today a post on reddit where someone said there was a scam for the trezor asking to type your seed on the computer. But it’s a scam so I assume the real way to enter your seeds is only on the trezor
edit: here is the post on reddit about the scam:

25€ in september 2017
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:34:40
Yes that’s what I said. 24! Should be read as 24 factorial
@_date: 2019-05-15 13:19:31
So what’s the point to have a hardware wallet if you need a computer too enter your seeds ?
For me the point to a hardware wallet is to don’t have to be scared about someone puting some malware on your computer because even with that no one can access to your money.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:33:51
same here
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:23:21
You can use coinbase pro. Nearly no fees using your bank account, and no fees to send your bitcoin to your BRD wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-31 10:27:12
I think you can, because ledger live is just a mean to check your portfolio (and make some actions on your ledger of course) but in my opinion, you just have to create differents accounts and it should be ok.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:10:52
Oh, you asked in that way ? The answer is yes. When you create a new wallet it displays the 12 words that are your seed.
Since these words are the way you have your private key, it means that the bitcoin in your wallet are your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-27 20:02:58
Do you use coinbase/coinbase pro with a mobile phone only ?
I have to admit that I don't go on exchanges on my phone, I think it's easier on a computer.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:52:42
what's the matter with ledger live ?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:42:51
It’s the only one I use on mobile. Otherwise I use a ledger.
Don’t about the wallet, but I think I use the same address. I have to check.
Edit : I didn’t set anything myself but it seems that’s it’s multi addresses.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:10:31
I use it and so far I have no complains and think it’s a great wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-29 15:11:53
Where I live it depends if the people who you send the money is in the same bank as you or not.
When I send money to another bank it can take up to three business days, even if it take usually only one day.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:31:09
Something like 24! So 6.204484e+23  possibilities. If I’ m not wrong. But I don’t know how long it could take.
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:28:10
This one I can answer !
From what I read, when all the bitcoins will be mined, miners will still be needed so the will be payed by the fees on transaction. Hope I don't say any bullshit but that's how I understood it.
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:57:22
could you explain why is ledger live a "shitty bug-ridden wallet" ?
So far I didn't have any problem with it so I'm really interested by your feedback.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:21:46
And it's totally ok to send from legacy to segwit ?
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:33:25
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:14:11
I only have the ledger nano s and so far I’m happy with it. But I’m new in crypto so what do I know.
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:40:06
You don't need to do anything. Just connect to coinbase pro with your login and password from coinbase and it's all good.
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:04:43
Ok thanks, it's now clear to me.
But I think OP uses CB pro to avoid the fees linked to the purchase of bitcoins with credit card. 
Or maybe I'm wrong, who knows !
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:21:04
First of all, to buy bitcoin, you can use coinbase pro (even if some people don't like it, I personnally think it's good) or Kraken, I don't know well the other exchanges.
You should also have a hot wallet, on your computer or your mobile phone. There are plenty of them, some are good and some are less good. But it's important to take away your coins from exchanges and to keep it somewhere ou possess the key (private key).
When you begin to have a good amount, it's better to buy a hardware wallet (ledger, trezor) and send your funds there.
If you plan to only buy and hold your bitcoin, you can skip the hot wallet part and directly go to the hardware wallet part. It requires a small invesment but after that you will be safe.
Hope this will help.

Thanks ! 
I understood that deleting the account was to left no trace but I was not sure about the built of the history.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:19:18
Yes for you i understand. But what about those who say it’s shit but don’t use Windows 7?
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:36:53
Don't overreact ! You don't need to listen to people who complain whatever you do ! I think it's a great idea and hope it will work well.
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:35:31
When an exchange or a faucet or whatever asks you to send bitcoin to withdraw your funds it should always rise a red flag.
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:33:29
To send bitcoin recently from a hot wallet to my ledger nano I set the fees as "economic", it cost me 0.03€ and took arround half a day.
If you want instant transfer you should rise the fees or use the lightning network but I don't know much about this one (yet).
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:51:08
Can you explain what you mean by "you should buy debit" ? English is not my primary language so I don't understand your answer but I'm interested to understand it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:50:15
Because theoricaly you don't keep that paper near your device.
