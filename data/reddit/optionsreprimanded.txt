Send me bitcoin, internet money that requires me to have fiat money to access it most of the time. 
Bitcoin can’t be used to purchase things at scale like cash can. Sure there’s people allowing you to buy things with bitcoin but for a man who appears to be homeless I highly doubt he is able to use it in such a way that alleviates his poverty and makes his life a bit easier. 
This appears to be a scam.

How will they tip strippers in a cashless society?

I don’t know how to open many addresses yet. But then there’s the issue of keeping track of them or it being cumbersome. Can any of the addresses be used as throwaways?
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:57:18
Transparency is not for me and you. It’s for the government. They need to be transparent and we should have every penny they collect and spend be open and transparent. I bet you anything they would never do this as it would expose a lot of corruption. But then for us regular folk we should allow anyone to peer into our accounts at will? Doesn’t sound good to me. I’m sorry. Whether I understand the Blockchain transparency or not isn’t the issue. It’s the fact that I don’t need to share what my value is whether it’s 100 dollars or 1 million dollars.

People also said BTC would be at 27K by April 2018. It’s now May and nothing has happened. I don’t believe the hype surrounding price predictions for any coin. The markets can sway at any moment. One bad rumor or move by a government onto crush or regulate sends the market in a downward spiral. 
What’s to say tomorrow that doesn’t happen again. One more. The markets are the deciders of the price not mcafee or others who have a stake in coins say so.

It’s known that the government and bankers or customer reps working on your account will see your worth. It’s different when it’s open completely to the public. I guess back in the day your mattress or the wife’s bra was the place to hide money. Nowadays theres always some peering eyes. I’d love for it to be completely private. 
The only people who have to have their books exposed are the crony politicians. I bet corruption would sink to all time lows once we can see where the money is going.

How come there is no wizard in the midst of this all?
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:50:52
How can I get multiple addresses? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:52:24
Either way, whether I’m rich or not... really doesn’t make me feel comfortable flashing my wallet or my bank account. I’m sure the majority of people don’t just let everyone know their account balances or have it open to them at any moment someone else chooses. There should be an added layer of privacy here. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:08:14
Except BTC has inflated and deflated based on government intervention. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 18:12:25
I thought the game was to buy high and sell low?
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:26:01
Bitcoin only works if you can find someone stupid enough to buy it. All the people here with this open ledger bullshit. It’s controlled by 10 people. Sharks own bitcoin. Why would I give money for some line of code and to top that all transactions are visible on the ledger. I don’t need anyone knowing how much I spend and where, there’s already an uproar about companies using our data without permission but when we have bitcoin suddenly everyone has a glass house and open door policy. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:56:26
What platform were you using to trade because many exchanges don’t even have fiat, how can the government request we pay them fiat when they don’t accept crypto?
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:23:03
So bitcoin isn’t subject to manipulation? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:40:42
You’re completely out of your mind if you believe that. Let alone the fact that 10 sharks control bitcoin. Talk about centralized power for a decentralized coin. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:39:41
Blah blah blah. Save time the libertarian/anarchist  bullshit. How do you buy bitcoin? Answer: fiat. 
Can you buy mainstream products and services with BTC? Nope. So stop acting like it’s going to replace fiat. You assume bankers and politicians will just bow down and let you swoop in your idealist bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:53:31
What is an OTC service?
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:32:54
How can you access OTC buyers and sellers?
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:41:59
So can I pay the government taxes with bitconnect? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:58:15
Anyone here smelling a class action lawsuit? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:26:49
Why does bitcoin have to be tied to fiat. This tethering to fiat is one of bitcoins failures. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:20:00
Find a customer who is willing to sell you their land for some oepnsource lines of code. Cryptocurrencies are not what they’re made out to be.  
@_date: 2018-07-01 02:59:53
You can fork bitcoin as many times as you want. It’s open source code. There’s many bitcoin forks. Enough said. Stop being anal. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 03:55:13
I hope you can read. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:08:48
Bitcoin can be forked. Why are you ignoring this fact ?
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:37:12
I have no intention of creating another scam. I don’t believe all transactions need to be made publicly available. 
Furthermore, at least my banks can reverse fraudulent transactions. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:24:15
By design I can simply fork bitcoin and make another one. How many BTC forks exist already? Very many. This whole thing is a sham. I thought anyone against it was an idiot until I did more research. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:40:44
Bitcoin has greater flaws 
@_date: 2018-07-06 01:51:17
So the rumor spreads once again that it will hit $25k by year end. Suddenly it will rise to 15/18k in September much earlier than anticipated and the sharks will dump once again. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:08:23
Who gives a shit. You can fork bitcoin that’s what matters. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:22:21
Many people on these forums and on the internet are simply paid shills or AI chatbots. Say one thing in disagreement and you’ll be attacked and downvoted. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 00:43:53
Do you not wonder why bitcoin wasn’t shut down by the government and why does the government own so much of it? Does this ever enter your mind at all? 
Bitcoin transactions are bad because they take a long time, they’re all public and they can’t be reversed. They’re subject to hacks and forks which can cause inflation. 
Once a government bans crypto its done. Look at what happened in SK. It’s subject to a lot more forces of manipulation than you think and it’s tied to fiat. What more do you want me explain ?
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:55:20
In greater ways 
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:38:53
How am I mentally ill? Because I made one typo and said transactions are subject to fork and not the coin itself? 
I think you’re the one who lives in his own bubble. I can’t change what you think if your reality is whatever your imagination deems it to be. So I’ll go on my way. Keep thinking that those who disagree with you are mentally ill. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:35:45
You’re an idiot. The tech is OLD AF. It’s not new. P2P transactions are old. They just remarketed this old tech with a new name and a new image. 
“Speed and throughput come at the expense of decentralization, and the more you increase the former, the more of the latter you lose. Blockchains such as EOS and NEO may be ”faster” than bitcoin, but they’re also highly centralized because they rely on a much lower number of validator nodes, among other things”

Bitcoin transactions are not instantaneous. I can charge my bank card that will settle in seconds. The only reason why transactions with banks take long is if you’re doing a wire transfer and they are doing their due diligence and adhering to the laws. 
Bitcoins transactions are not reversible. Send it to the wrong person or to the wrong wallet and kiss it goodbye. 
Talking shit about me and asking me to see a psychologist because you’re a butthurr fan boy of bitcoin doesn’t help your cause and shows how much intellect you have.

Crypto currencies are actually unique because they function as both a medium of exchange and as a stock at the same time

Gold doesn’t get divided up like bitcoin does you jackass.

100s of addresses. It’s very likely that many addresses are linked to one person giving a false impression that there are thousands. The biggest bullshit we know of today is that mysteriously we can’t find the “original” creator of bitcoin which is nothing more than smoke and mirrors. 
- US government one of the largest holders
