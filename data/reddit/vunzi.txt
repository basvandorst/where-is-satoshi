I did the math on this one, can confirm

It takes a lot of creativity to came up with 1000 different ways of saying "we fucked up and have no idea what is going on"

Sure, you have someone from house Stark, you have different houses trying to achieve world dominance, it is now December so you could say winter is coming... I mean the whole thing screams GoT

thank you
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:48
Exactly :)

Came for this, was not disappointed (okay, just a bit, I had to scroll a lot)

Just a word of caution: think about if you want just to have the public data or to have a tool which does the trading for you as well. The latter is dangerous if you do not trust the tool because you have to provide API keys.

I am just saying that 1BTC==$0.00 is not going to happen on this planet. $340k would be enough to buy 17,000,000 BTC (rounded up what we currently have) at $0.02
For the record, not a downvoter
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:44:50
How exactly is the pushing happening?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:09:13
Yepp, I stand corrected. Now also found a list of the banks with their roll-out dates, most of them are indeed in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:14:08


You'd be amazed what people would/can do for $2,720,000,000 (assuming BTC is priced at $17k)
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:16:59
But is this true??
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:54
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:59:18
That is bullshit (or bearshit if you prefer). I'd personally buy ALL bitcoins if they drop to $0.01 - talking about just $170k.
And I am guessing there is someone out there having $340k ready...
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:58:45
Sure there are. The problem is: these banks might not be in your country, you might not be allowed to open an account there, there might be only some types of accounts providing 1.25% - most probably some saving account where you are not allowed to withdraw the money for 1 year. And even if all conditions are met - the inflation (at least in the EU) is surely going to eat up all profits, not to mention you have to pay taxes on this interest.

Too lazy to filter the raw data. Going to work as well.

"MTP is a statistic calculated over 11 blocks, and trails behind wall clock time by about 6 blocks. This means that the last common block will be approximately the 6th block with a timestamp after 12:20pm. The block after that will be different on either chain."
Shouldn't it be the 478552+7 = 478559th block?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:27:33
well it might go down as well but with this huge balance you won't feel a thing, mark my words
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:39:54
Not to mention the Vietnamese Dong

How on earth is this going to be hacked? It just generates a link which you can type yourself btw. I get that BTC is worth a lot but sometimes I think people are getting too paranoid...

HODL!!! Expect 1000% ROI in the next couple of months / milliseconds

Thank you. Should be like 2 minutes but the CD api is messed up and I really have to go to work now... But look at the cool progress bar :)
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:34:40
Be my guest.  - press on this as much as you can. I'll sign up for an amazon account right now and will post a referral link to a new display for you to buy (it's a win win for both of us)
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:38:55
I really don't see it coming. But if you know a way of getting BTC by IP + amount please let me know, I am really interested (asking for a friend)
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:02:07
Thank you!

Sure but having low fees and speedy transactions is definitely something I expect from the currency I intend to use. Just saying that it makes it harder to spread the word given the current situation and the advances on the evil side

With localbitcoins I meant mycelium local trader or however this feature of the app is called.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:57:42
Yes, you are welcome
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:33:57
 is better in that regard
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:58:48
My advice: use these $20 to buy some BTC
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:41:34
You don't need that many people. I am volunteering to do this, please just give me the gold bar
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:23:23
Agree, lots of people are going to get burned by the incoming market correction. But as they say - there is no bad press. Such popular sites help push the adoption so that is the good part.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:08:12
VTC ought to be Vertcoin - ASIC-resistant, 2.5 min blocks having their diff adjusted every block. They also promise SW and LN. It is getting some attention lately but it remains an altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:45:15
Localbitcoins if you want to buy BTC with EUR
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:16:02
The thing is scams and pyramid schemes are available for fiat as well and I also don't see anybody doing anything about it. Sure, there are some investigations here and there but that's it. Not to mention the whole fake money business. This is one point which is completely solved by Bitcoin. Overall I agree that there are some bad actors which throw shadows on Bitcoin but I cannot see this as a major point preventing adoption and/or causing huge crash
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:14:26

@_date: 2017-10-27 15:59:55
My idea: currently it is slightly more profitable to mine on the BCH chain as on the BTC chain (fork.lol)
Many miners would hop between the chains to collect the biggest profits. After some time the difficulty would adjust and all will be fine
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:33:09
It will drop until 4062 and then start a rebound. This is a scientific fact. We had that in first grade at our school.
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:34:49
Hmm that would be pretty simple static HTML page. I can even provide you the source here:

Just running a stream draining some faucet. Kind of bored on a Tuesday night. But might as well turn this into my job, depends on the feedback
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:33:12
Sure, pet project vs multi-million dollar company with hundreds thousands of users - sounds about the same.
For the record, not a Coinbase supporter but anyone who has worked professionally in the IT knows that there is a difference between a local feature deployment and something which impacts millions of users and funds
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:42:52
Both. Looking at the chart for 6th to 14th august, the rise is not healthy - even with SW activated. The recent drop is an expected correction; the market should continue where it did a sharp turn from the projected road. My analysis points this to 4062 (given past rise, etc.)
Of course this market is nothing like the things we've seen, so we should stay alert
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:40:30
No, $8142 by 28th February 2018
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:34:33
Was sceptical at first but ran some simulations and also can confirm that 2 &gt; 1. At least this was the result in 99.99999999% of my test runs
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:22:14
Mark my word, if we hit $8142 on Feb 28th, 2018 you better open YouTube and watch the live stream

Did you mean Jihan or is there some new alt-coin premined by ISIS that I was not aware of?
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:10:55
How did you determine the number 247?
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:36:05




Would you care to elaborate on that? Do you have some time range in mind or was that just a figure of speech? I like the maximum count argument but I also find the decentralization point important - it kind of gives one a sense of security
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:45:07
I see, found the list... Sadly could not find my name on it
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:47:30
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:27:34
I am aware of that but is there a list for the first 246? The number seems pretty arbitrary
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:20:01
Where? Where?
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:25:19
Feel free to do it. Got to believe in something

Man, I'd eat my d*** live on YouTube, I promise you this
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:53:23
I've never stated that governments would come apart - my point is just about fiat disappearing. I do understand that fiat and governments are tightly coupled (obvious given the fact that governments are actually printing fiat money) and I also support your point that governments do some useful stuff (most of them). I am definitely not the anarchist crypto enthusiast type who wants to see the whole world dive into anarchy.
And I find this a valid point that after the adoption of crypto the governments would just have to shift their focus on the money question. My whole question was just based on thoughts if the disappearing of fiat is an imaginable scenario at all. I am constantly thinking about poor countries, countries without basic infrastructure, etc. and how they don't have cellular networks, not to mention internet infrastructure, not to mention crypto

@_date: 2017-07-22 09:01:04
Okay, I must say I wasn't aware of and this shows quite big acceptance / adoption (will). Thanks for the hint.
I agree that some flexibility is necessary. The combination of hodling+spending is a viable solution.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:50:35
I definitely see this on all the exchanges and know of many services supporting / accepting Bitcoin though it seems to me that this is the smaller part of the users. But I could be wrong, of course. This is why I started the discussion
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:45:00
Okay, I must admit this statement is based on my impressions of the majority of users here on reddit and on bitcointalk. And I was thinking this is also where the majority of Bitcoin owners are to be found
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:00:20
I was also absent for a long time but I think I got the jist:
* A guy called Jihan wants to screw Bitcoin
* Look for a picture of a Bitcoin in a rollercoaster here on reddit - if it is pointing downwards -&gt; buy buy buy, otherwise just buy
* HODL
Please correct me if I am wrong
