If you can't laugh at a T-shirt with a current investment value higher than your house you aren't having fun :)

Absolutely 100% no question that only idiots think that the "principle" or Bitcoin somehow would let it survive some moronic POW switch. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:22:13
Oh dear. You seem to have no clue if how the world works. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:02:20
You can frame the end product. Still weird though. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:29:28
Oh sweet child. Judging users by age is sort of an idiot idea. My point is that Poloniex for example have trading outages that cost users millions due to them not being able to close positions. A short delay in withdrawals is not that bad compared, and kraken is well funded. It would surprise me if the issue persist. They solved it for me in less than an hour. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:38:14
That tonal Bitcoin bullshit nerdspeak needs to go. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:10:30
It's not irrationally overpriced at all. It's overpriced because of the completely rational reason that 90% of people still don't understand how to buy bitcoin any other way, want the tax benefits of the shares etc. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:17:52
That's sort of my point. Sure, it's all well and good to be a libertarian and want Bubu in Burkina Faso to be able to run a full node on a Texas T81 and a telegraph line but then you also have to be aware that it is a fringe network with no real value. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:05:08
Sellers gonna cry. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:07:33
You can't just use the collapse of Silk Road as part of some convoluted technical analysis marker. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:19:28
It's such a collection of idiot arguments for Bitcoin here you can't even tell if people are serious. If this is the state of the community, Bitcoin already lost. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:02:33
That's what everyone that holds no Bitcoin says. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:26:12
OK fair enough. I can't say that I 'like' Kraken (I think their trading interface blows in general). Just pointing out that 'so far' they have been one of the more reliable exchanges to date. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:04:06
Or call on them to sit down with the miners and reach a consensus instead of this retarded stalemate that will only cause price depression and an inevitable fork.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:44:25
Dat scaling though. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 15:23:48
There is a stark difference between having an issue, and making the blanket statement that everyone should stay away from using a service. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:55:04
No. It has 120% of Bitcoin value if you consider that there are 100 Billion XRP
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:23:36
You bought clearly fraudulent gift cards from Localbitcoin and now you are angry at Purse?
@_date: 2017-05-08 20:25:17
It's a Bitcoin exchange. The exchange part works just fine, they are having temporary funding issues. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:50:04
Not even close. A cheap phone in Africa cost far less than you would be led to believe. And even if you make $10/day $1 fee would make bitcoin uselessly unattractive. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:00:49
While I agree that decentralization is great. You (everyone) needs to realize that if we want Bitcoin to grow. We can't stifle it with pipe dreams such as the ones purpotraited by LukeJr etc. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:59:25
Agreed. It's not good. But it's less bad if you realize that they are a bank and have the expectation that when 1 million new customers sign up every few months they get bogged down with issues and support requests. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:16:13
That's not an argument if you claim that Bitcoin is worth money before you sell them. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:52:09
That was the advice at $650 as well. Didn't quite pan out. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:59:05
"$1 fee is not a problem". Westerners with $10k+ in BTC that doesn't realize that $1 represents a days income in half the world. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:39:22
Oh I totally understand that. I went through Buttfinex haircut. I did have the same withdraw issue earlier today and they resolved that so I'm keeping the faith. Best of luck.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:03:01
Not at all. If you aren't pressed for time and want to purchase a bitcoin or two Coinbase is an excellent option. People just live under the misunderstanding that it's an 'exchange' or 'trading engine' when in reality its a Bank that allows you to buy and sell Bitcoin. 
Use Gemeni if you want to trade ffs. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:12:41
Obviously not, since half the community wants to switch POW. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:53:14
Wow, you are a brave whistle blower! This post joins you with a select group of only 1500 people to whine about Cooinbase in the last 6 months. 
They are a BANK! Read the TOS! 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:55:05
This is exactly why the "but decentralization" argument is retarded. People on fucking modems in Albania don't run nodes as it is. Only idiots see it as some kind of human rights to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:47:04
It's not even that. Why should anyone care if Bitcoin exchanges gets a fine and an administrative slap on the wrist for acting like robber barons. Has nothing to do with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:55:53
Fixed. Support just updated the status.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:12:07
What kind of argument is that? "Yeah I was gonna buy shares in Tesla, but I think Ford might go bankrupt, so obviously cars is just a fad". 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:10:12
Just like only the first child you have is a real child. The other ones are just alt kids.

I am the proud owner of a $186,000 Bitcoin T-shirt. It's a quality Fruit of the Loom though so I figure maybe if I Hodl it long enough... 
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:46:42
Hah, I'll trade you my $230,000 Bitcoin T-shirt. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:01:31
Because it serves a purpose supported by Core and Theymos. I don't necessarily disagree, but it's fairly obvious and sad that they pick and choose when to enforce the subreddit rules they use widely to ban people but only when it fits. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:17:58
It will never happen period. UASF is a pipedream. Most half ass intelligent people realize that it would only lead to the miners forking and Bitcoin value to drop to a pittance overnight. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:32:43
I personally think the correction will come at $2600. There is MASSIVE amounts of USD flowing into BTC right now. Coinbase/Gemeni aren't even able to nibble at the pace of new account verifications.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:48:52
Crooks will be crooks. If you can't see through this and realize that Butfinex is arbitrage trading to become solvent using customer funds you are an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:57:18
The hell does that have to do with hardware centralization? You can't be THAT dumb. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:59:49
Not at all. CRYPTO developers designed and coded SegWit, for natural reasons they did so on the Bitcoin codebase. It's not a 'Bitcoin SegWit' it's just SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:16:19
The problem with "and I hope others head my advice" is that they have 3+ million customers and quite obviously the vast majority is quite happy. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:59:29
It's all fluff sales to get press just like the Bitcrystal sale which was more expensive. Pointless to even pretend it's "worth" that much since only one card sold for that price. 
I can easily create an asset and sell one of them for 100 BTC to myself and claim it's worth $160,000
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:23:05
You can't math. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:11:16
Or you know, twice as many Bitcoin. Damn, it sure takes a high functioning autistic to not enjoy making money. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:44:54
Well, in her defense she comes from a long line of batshit crazy racists and was backed by an orange retard and a Russian Oligarch. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:33:34
Unless the answer is a Bitcoin heavy private key. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:02:49
No it doesn't. The legal team and Mark has confirmed that they need an average Bitcoin price of $2900 to reverse the proceedings and claim solvency. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:50:33
If you purchased them through Localbitcoin there is a 90% chance they are far from legit. The fact that amazon hasn't invalidated them means very little.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:01:27
POW, right in the $50 Bitcoin if you are dumb enough to try to swap POW. No offense but it's an idiot idea.
