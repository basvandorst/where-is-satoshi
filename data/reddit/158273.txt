Brilliant! Thanks.
Would someone like the people who have MtGox's coins actually use this, or do they have too many coins to be able to use this service?

Then she should increase her skills, talents, and/or the value she provides.

Well... isn't there a certain level of trust with these websites based on past experience that others have had with them and/or how long they've been around?

Is that true though? Sending, perhaps. But what about receiving coins? Let's say you receive Bitcoin in a non-legal way and want to exchange it into fiat. The moment you try to use any exchange, they will ask for your ID verification, etc.
That was the basis of my original question... what would someone do in that scenario? Let's say they transferred all the MtGox coins into a Bitcoin wallet and are now trying to figure out how to exchange those bitcoins into cash...
