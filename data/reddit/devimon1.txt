yeah, if it were just duck or just go, would be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:03:25
Yeah, that's why any small company shouldn't even bother to make something like a search engine. You need investments.

BU supporters like to talk about how wrong it is to honor Satoshi and how unimportant he is.
lol, if you make false claims at least make them believable

Ah, well I assume there's no way to cancel the transaction now :/
I never changed the fees and didn't have any problems before, even when sending bigger amounts. I'm using an Electrum wallet by the way.

There are never delays when you send small amounts. Try to send 300$ in one go and you'll see that it takes a while for confirmation.

I still need it, I just PM'ed you!

FYI, Gemini isn't avaliable worldwide right now. Just tried registering and it shut me down, sad to see it happen since I'm form the EU and most sites like these support our coutries. It's not like I'm trying to register from the middle east.

Thank you so much. You didnt reply to me about the steam account though, you sure you don't need anything? Like I can gift you a cheap game or something.

Thanks so much mate, I will. 
If you won't take a steam gift, atleast take this movie recommendation that I think anyone at should see. [The Big Short](

Electrum is great for small amounts and multiple sends at the same time aswel, definitely recommending.

That field day  would be anywhere but here, because here it would get deleted into oblivion ;)

420,000 blaze it

It could be done. But it will still need to follow some countries rules, since the server will exist in some country. I mean you can't make it in outer space where there aren't any laws.
