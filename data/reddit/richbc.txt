This is reddit, no need to be politically correct..Watch his interviews to see how rude and disrespectful he was to all bitcoin innovators, Wences Casares, Winklevoss twins, Vitalik Buterin...

I would never work for a douche like you anyway

At this point in time he does not have the capacity to understand any of the technical stuff. Have you listened to his interviews ? Clueless! He should come back in 2018, we will have bitcoin-for-dummies infrastructure ready by then.

Nice try, troll. Good luck with your GUI-less shitcoin, mined only by botnets.

You're a terrible host, I've seen all your bitcoin related TechCrunch interviews and it 'hurts' to listen to you. Disrespectful. Who the fuck gave  you that job ?! You are also clueless about bitcoin, people like you don't have the necessary intelect to understand bitcoin.

Wow you are an idiot. Monero is dead. Real bitcoin 2.0 is Ethereum, ring signatures dapp will be released in a month or two..
