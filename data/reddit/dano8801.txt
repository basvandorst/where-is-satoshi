That's kind of the issue here.  
It's great because it's not regulated.  
It's fucked because it's not regulated.

No, actually you're giving the perception it's with more than cash...
By your logic, the GBP is worth less than the dollar...
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:20:26
Right. Which is exactly what I just said.

But your $100 in bitcoin is still USD. That's like saying $100 USD in euros is still $100.

Would it be possible to make the entire piece bigger for future jobs?  The cuts would then be bigger also, and you could use larger tooling.  
Would depend on how big is "too big."

If he's going that route, he could just program the CNC to cut each piece apart in the end.  He'd just have to find a way to have the fixture hold each individual piece.

Oh. I forgot this is a personal machine. I'm used to big industrial verticals. You obviously have fewer options.

Not sure what he'd want to use that would hold everything down but leave the face entirely open.  First thing that came to mind was a vacuum fixture, but that would only work if none of the vacuum holes line up with the location of the final separating cuts.  Otherwise, obviously, he'd lose vacuum and start throwing pieces.

What are you cutting with?  Just a typical endmill?  Can you beef up the size and take off more material with each pass?  Or are the cuts too thin to allow a larger tool?

My 2.5 cents is now worth like 11.
That's one hell of a return.
Fuck my life.

Ahh, no wonder it takes forever.  Damn tool isn't even 50 thou thick!
