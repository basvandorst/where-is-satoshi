[Code of Federal Regulations (Title 49, part 591.5(i)](  
Mind you, there are legal car dealers in the US that sell those cars (Lamborghini, Ferrari). Just in my city there's quite a few. They are regulated for US roads. They are not "right-hand drive".

If you live in the US, you have to deal with the import laws with cars. It's pretty crappy. IIRC, the car must be 20 years old to be imported directly to the US. I think it's 15 years for Canada.  
*edit* was corrected; it's 25 years in the US

Even with the wheel locked, they just prob pick it up you think?  
My co-worker was showing me a tracking device to order for my bike on ebay a couple weeks before this happened. Live n learn I guess!  
Hopefully we will both be back riding in the future then! Thanks for sharing your story. Sometimes I tell myself I'm avoiding a bad day by not having that bike; I was only a rider for about 8 months and I live in a city where people drive like fuckin maniacs. Had a lady in a Mercedes earlier this year, drive right past me in my lane (was in the right bike lane of the middle lane; 3 lane 45mph main road) at about 50mph. All she could do was shake her head and apologize when rode up to her at the light. A co worker of mine got slammed into at a red light a week later. Still, miss the hell out of riding.

Here's a tip; unless you're sponsored by someone, at that age, anything you can say that sounds elaborate will be met with skepticism, doubt, or some other form of dismissal. Don't expect people to think a 13 year old knows anything about the world. Make your own way, be smart, do research ... you'll be fine. Just always be humble and take any opportunity to learn from everything you can.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:49:50
True but then it would be a private seller instead of directly from Amazon. Still, victims can be had, unfortunately.

Hell yeah!! This is what I like to see. Already, Bitcoin is proving to allow someone who may have previously had much less control/input to make a huge positive impact.  
Well done!! I hope this encourages others who may have seen a similar success with Bitcoin, to help the world or their surrounding communities in a directly positive way. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:40:27
From what I understand, yes, but I don't think it is as simple as that.   
For example, if I want to purchase a 1992 Toyota Supra from Japan, well let's just say I can. I bring it here and drive it. Eventually, it needs maintenance and some parts replaced. Will that stimulate the US economy? More than likely not, as the parts will need to be imported as well. Sure you could tax that, but the auto industry doesn't profit. I'm sure the supercar dealers have a very profitable way of stimulating the US economy, seeing as how those cars can depreciate rapidly yet sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The auto industry has a whole bunch of rules that make it suck. Why do some cars break so easily here? Because the manufacturers are **required** to create replacement parts for 'X' amount of years. This is just what I know, but there is likely more to it.

There is not such thing as 100% security, theoretically, because that would be assuming unknown variables. Currently, cold storage is the most viable method of securing your Bitcoin.  
There will always be hacking or people being hacked. Through the use of social engineering, many people are scammed out of their money. Others, are affected by malicious software due to lack of security on their computer/mobile device (of course, many are attacked with a combination of the two).  
Be educated, be careful, and utilize the utmost of the security controls you have available to you.

Would you really claim your fidgetspinner collection as an asset on paper?  
Also, said "database" is decentralized; how would one claim that as an asset?  
It is difficult to argue against units of Bitcoin individually owned are not an asset themselves; I would agree that aspect is true. It does have high liquidity, and it is quite volatile.  
When people use their own assets to gain altcoin, it is in the sole pursuit of profit for many, but not for all. Do you know what gives Bitcoin its 'store of value' characteristic (thus making it an "asset")? The technology.

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:11:30
Yeah I have some reservations with certain points in this article. My understanding of an asset is anything that is not money that can be (more or less) easily exchanged for money (in simple terms), regardless of how the item works. Nobody would be able to sell the computer database, however, because it is decentralized and many people are a part of it. So...is it that simple?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:37:00
Being taxed is one thing; being completely invaded and controlled is another. That's what I care about ultimately. The title for this article is misleading.
I am not disagreeing that one should pay tax on any money they gain from trading Bitcoin for fiat (however corrupt the US tax system is).

Thank you for the insight. What do you think of this [article?](
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:52:19
Writing zeroes over the drive is known as a Low Level **Format**. Depending on how many "passes" you perform, the data is more difficult to retrieve.  
EDIT: To be clear, you're correct about him being "wrong" in the sense that a "regular format" it is not a "bitwise reset" of the drive. The sectors are just effectively ignored and will be overwritten eventually through normal disk operation.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:24:28
Fair enough the howtogeek links were in response to a post about low-level format and I did not read the links thoroughly enough. Why would low-level formatting tools give you the option run run 1 pass all the way to 32 passes if there is no point?  
EDIT: Found this [link]( interesting. User claiming to recover partial data after finishing writing zeros.  
EDIT: I think [this]( answers the question about 32 passes being a limit and the possibility of recovering data.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:53:45
From the previous article on a security forum that I posted:  
"Some data may fail to be totally obliterated by a single write due to two phenomena:
We want to write a bit (0 or 1) but the physical signal is analog. Data is stored by manipulating the orientation of groups of atoms within the ferromagnetic medium; when read back, the head yields an analog signal, which is then decoded with a threshold: e.g., if the signal goes above 3.2 (fictitious unit), it is a 1, otherwise, it is a 0. But the medium may have some remanence: possibly, writing a 1 over what was previously a 0 yields 4.5, while writing a 1 over what was already a 1 pumps up the signal to 4.8. By opening the disk and using a more precise sensor, it is conceivable that the difference could be measured with enough reliability to recover the old data.
    Data is organized by tracks on the disk. When writing over existing data, the head is roughly positioned over the previous track, but almost never exactly over that track. Each write operation may have a bit of "lateral jitter". Hence, part of the previous data could possibly still be readable "on the side".
Multiple writes with various patterns aim at counterbalancing these two effects.
Modern hard disks achieve a very high data density. It makes sense that the higher data density is, the harder it becomes to recover traces of old overwritten data. It is plausible that recovering overwritten data is no longer possible with today's technology. At least, nobody is currently positively advertising such a service (but this does not mean that it cannot be done...).
Note that when a disk detects a damaged sector (checksum failure upon reading), the next write operation over that sector will be silently remapped to a spare sector. This means that the damaged sector (which has at least on wrong bit, but not necessarily more then one) will remain untouched forever after that event, and no amount of rewriting can change that (the disk electronic board itself will refuse to use that sector ever again). If you want to be sure to erase data, it is much better to never let it reach the disk in the first place: use full-disk encryption."
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:58:53
Actually there are accessible and affordable technologies with the ability to do so. The more you know about data forensics, the more your reach. A quick Google search found this [software]( Also, refer to [this]( and [this]( which describe a method using Linux.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:23:54
Yeah BitLocker or some other equivalent is foolproof, especially if you implement it with TPM. I've been told there exist hardware ($$$) that can assist in recovering data from low-level formatted drives, but there seems not to be an proof that exists. Thanks!

I see your point and sympathize, however please remember access to this community is not exclusive by any means. With sudden mass adoption of the idea "Hey, BTC is a thing...everyone is saying it's a thing. It can get me rich quick, what? OMG ALL MY MONEYZ GO NAO WUTS COINBAE? HODL!" , there comes in a lot of people ranging from 16 year olds trying to find a way to bitcoin, to people trying to manipulate the crypto "market" (idk, is that the right word?), and people who just think it's a stock. A lot of people miss the point behind the technology and its true motive. Yes, the early adopter and people who support and seek to make the technology better for everyone are **rewarded** with some wealth. I think that's fair.
I stumbled upon r/Bitcoin not but barely a few months ago. I too, came in only with having watched a few popular Bitcoin documentaries and knowing the basics of cryptography and PKI. I still am learning so much and try to sit on the sidelines and not say too much. So I appreciate the openness of this community and how it has helped me both directly and indirectly.  
So my point is, please don't over generalize by pointing at the entire community. There are some really helpful, and extremely intelligent people here. I have had only good interactions, personally, in the past 3 months after actually communicating.

While I agree with you a lot of these types of people exist, 'vast majority' is a bit of a stretch without something to prove it.  
I think there are also a lot of people who just get lucky, or are indeed inheriting something substantial. That being said, I am someone who grew up in a shitty neighborhood and by my early 20's I got out completely on my own supporting myself and others. I make a decent living now and managed to start my own business. I am a computer teacher who used to work in construction/property management, so I feel that I definitely know what hard work is like.  
Create Sillybands? Mega money.  
Create Minecraft? What's after Mega money? (difference here? this invention took some serious thought, refinement and hard work...though I doubt the motive was money initially)  
That being said, based on conventional wisdom it seems a lot of people automatically believe someone with a lot of money is corrupt, born into it, or given all of it. It *does* make it easier to accept because it's one of those things that is hard to understand based on some peoples' life experiences. It is a byproduct of our type of society, though not perfectly fair, everyone does have a chance at freedom and opportunity.

It's easy to stay ignorant when the world shapes you to be skeptical of anything that seems "too good to be true".  
I remember one of my students encouraging me to buy when it was around $300. I told him I would drop $800 in it after he gave me all his reasoning and links to research. At the time I really didn't know shit about it, was just talking crap, and never did it. I bet I don't need to explain how I felt once I did take a week to watch some research and watch a couple docs. I finally dropped a couple thousand over ~50 days when it was between $3500-$5500

The technology is not about getting rich but helping change what money is defined as. That being said, it will be interesting to see what people will do with that kind of money, as many who do hodl 100 BTC may have been people living under circumstances where they never thought to escape minimum wage or something similar. I would like to see investments in businesses that do more to help people than make a profit. I would like to see more children being adopted and given a chance at a nice life.

I barely gave him effort as he did not want to listen. Thing is when I did start talking about the technology and some of the recent milestones (one thing I mentioned was Zimbabwe and how it's benefited many people there in their economic state) everyone got quiet and started listening, asking me more. Usually when I do bring up Bitcoin in a group, someone says something like that (bubble, scam, etc.) but when I refute it and start talking, everyone is quiet as fuck and all looking at me. Problem is, I'm not an expert. I have been researching every day and learning one more thing at least about BTC and cryptocurrencies every day. So I only try to talk as far as my knowledge carries me. I still need to understand better the blockchain technology and infrastructure. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:25:33
Unfortunately this is true, however we also want to get as many people on board with supporting the technology as possible, right? Even if a chunk of those people are uneducated and just throwing money at it, they are still actively engaging in Bitcoin. It doesn't help if *everyone* just hodls; we need people to spend and support their local businesses, especially those who just started accepting Bitcoin.  
Now people like you, who seem to have been around in the community for a while and know their stuff, have the opportunity to be educating these people. Nobody is saying you are required to, or even that you *should*, but the opportunity is there. Many probably won't listen or even care to understand (ow, my brain!) though what else can we do? It's better if we have 10,000 more people becoming a part of Bitcoin for the wrong reasons, than having 10,000 denouncing Bitcoin, or am I wrong?

I knew nothing about bitcoin at the time so educating myself in the first place to start understanding it is what got me on board. The reason ppl only seen it as a bubble is because they think it's a stock with no intrinsic value. The technology is what provides intrinsic value. People and businesses adopting the use of bitcoin throughout the world will contribute toward cementing it as a medium of exchange. Try to educate yourself on non biased sources, and ask questions here and r/bitcoinbeginners from a neutral standpoint. Soak up as much as you can and after you've learned more, you may have a different perspective. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:15:04

@_date: 2017-11-29 18:03:18
Yeah, that's usually the argument, especially for those who have had to endure hardships for quite some time just to survive. I can't say I don't understand that desire to "escape society" but money has its own problems. I do agree that if you have a substantial amount, you have more control and security. However, it really depends where that money came from (not that in the previous example it would matter as much, I guess, it's not blood money) but all I'm saying is you can sit my ass on a gold throne in my castle but there will be many a silent day, where I'd sit there and realize I have all this just because I did something I normally would consider self-deprecation (to me).  
I came from a shit neighborhood, and even squandered some of the little oppurtunity I had when I was younger thanks to sacrifices from my family. Soon after dropping out of college I woke up and educated myself, went out and got a great paying job. I've used that to make some good investments, and now it's just a matter of time. I've made some mistakes up to this point, but glad that everything I have earned was actually earned by me and what I learned.

Opportunists with a mountain of resources making their mark when the time comes...in any case your fear of everyone in the US from having access to the internet would put us in line with countries like Venezuela who experience government mandated blackouts but look at the state that country is in. International relations won't be so great cutting the US off from the world suddenly...and to "stop bitcoin" no less. That shit decision would be more of a threat than bitcoin. All of the products sold....they rely on this infrastructure. Even a 99 yr old in bed relies on it for their medication and even existing in documentation for that matter.  
Your claim mirrors that of the puppeteer cutting away at the strings of his own marionette.

Do you have any sources on this? Would be interested in the read.
@_date: 2017-09-02 03:34:17
Hey, so do I just search coinbase and look in the app store for a well rated secure wallet? Thanks for any advice you can provide.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:38:20
You would have to disconnect pretty much every computer every where. The internet is just a massive meshed network with countless redundant connections. The government and military rely on it too you know...there is no switch.

Honestly this post makes me think of *DC's Legends of Tomorrow*  
"Satoshi", not unlike the characters in the show, travels back in time in order to stop a future disaster (banking system + world debt finally popping the lid of disaster, lyk z0mg). Thus he introduces Bitcoin, surreptitiously but selflessly.  It's the perfect system. Like wtf? And he is so perfectly anonymous. He has nothing to gain from this, but change the entire...world.."potentially", anyway.  
So he time jumps to some I.T. convention and sees what is depicted in OP's post. "Yes...I think this will be my name." **Nailed it.** Kinda like how the Legends choose corny names to represent themselves in that current time period, but more clever.

I am honestly baffled how so many people don't realize how much of a world changing potential bitcoin has. It's amazing to be a part of this. It truly will be an interesting history book in the social studies class of the future!
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:26:19
"A paper" ? I am also interested and know nothing of wallets. I want to store long term as well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:29:16
You won't see huge returns, but you can still use that bitcoin so it has value.  Put a little at a time and it will add up. That being said, save like 100 and then deposit so you don't add up on the purchase fees.

Well, if they aren't your keys it's not considered ethical to try and use them. Just like if you found a set of keys in your neighborhood, you wouldn't try opening everyone's front door with it (hopefully). Also if you don't know who was using that storage device before, I consider you wipe it because you don't know what could be lingering on there.

You "brought" it from somewhere or you bought it? Those are asymmetric encryption keys you're referring to and if you don't know what you encrypted them with, then I don't know what to tell you. This likely has nothing to do with bitcoin but it almost sounds like you bought a hard drive that you found someone else's data on so...that's why I was asking for clarification.

I like the concept, but I feel part of the idea is moving away from paper, but that's just my opinion! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:36:01
Yup the commenters on the article noticed it. Pretty crappy he didn't insert any references!
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:52:20
Where's the joke?
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:44:46
I appreciate the help! Gonna do it :)  
EDIT: Been trying a couple days now (not very frequently), but mycelium seems to be down?

I always knew the term was associated with not selling your BTC, but admittedly, never understood what HODL meant. "Is it an acronym?", I thought. Well, I was always too lazy to Google it, til now.  
Snickers Fun Fact: I once interpreted it as, "Hold On for Dear Life".

Redditor for 2 days...what brings you here, speculation?

That's a really nice train.  
EDIT: 9/10 would watch again

Damn...45% of my $400,000? I'd rather just net less ...

GEE. I sure hope that *dollar* makes it down safely n all........

I thought he claimed he has "nothing to do with Bitcoin" from the documentary I watched. Is he just showing interest as a hodler/investor after that like casually?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:03:29
Looks like a drain cobweb is handing from his head
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:19:40
Meanwhile you still see on bitcoin subreddits those who sneak in their unrelated comments promoting Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:49:31
-_- 6298 isn't really "to the moon" news at this point. Sigh. Sorry for the salt I thought I was going to see some huge jump as a I shakily typed "bitcoin price" into my search engine.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:14:52
Nice repost.

You will have to setup port forwarding in your home router (assuming you're at home with the typical wi-fi setup).  
Depending on your device manufacturer, the firmware and graphical menu will look different. Find out the make/model of your device first. Make sure you know the admin login credentials for your device (great time to change the defaults if you haven't already)
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:21:59
Interesting. Thanks for that heads up!
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:24:10
Think about a conversation with your future self about 2-3 years from now. He will thank you if you hodl the line...love isn't always on time!
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:50:37
Interesting article but found it difficult (annoying) to read at a few parts. It brings up a good point though, people follow blindly what they see on social media. Nothing wrong with hodling if you believe in what you are supporting. A lot of people see BTC as strictly a "stock" but forget about the ultimate purpose of what its ideal use.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:29:04
That's really irritating about the Venmo signs. You were never able to get an answer out of that huh? I guess ESPN didn't want to affiliate themselves with Bitcoin for some reason...
