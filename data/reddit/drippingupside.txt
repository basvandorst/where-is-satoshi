Well obviously right?

Not as funny as creating a fee market... then implementing Segwit.... Then "Look at all the money we save with reduced fees because of Segwit".

2x is an attack?... I thought it was an agreement?

Its possible they believe there is more future profit there.  It does not have to be immediate profit.  But who cares... they can do what they want.  Permissionless is key.

I also thought this was already resolved with a landslide vote?

I thought it was like 85%+ of miners and major businesses.  
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:22:59
They are mining for profit.  They want to make money.  Thats how the system was designed.

Luckily in Bitcoin you can run whatever you want.  Regardless of which fork "wins" you can even continue to run whatever you want.  Thats how this works.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:33:52
Again miners are supposed to love profits.  Thats how this thing was made and thats what makes it continue to work.  It literally defines Bitcoin.  So if you hate a major part of Bitcoin... maybe you just hate Bitcoin.  There are plenty of alt coins out there without the "evil, boogyman" miners.  Maybe you love those coins more.

If you hate the miners you also hate Bitcoin.

Is 2x really that much different from 1x?  Are people upset that Core will not be the only dev team after 2x?  Honest question.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:21:17
This is incredibly misleading and obviously fake.  Hope you get banned.  
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:16:22
Ya and we wouldnt have to worry about having "consensus".

At some point the costs of government outweigh the benefits.  At that point it is the peoples duty to show them the door.

Seems like he just wants old Bitcoin.  Whats wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:09:44
Raising the blocksize a bit would mean just doing the 2x NYA.  If you do the 2x agreement then Core would no longer be solely in "charge" of Bitcoin development.  (as I currently understand the situation... Im not a pro)  This is clearly a non-starter for Core.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:32:11
Nice, do you recommend dumping 2x NYA Bitcoin if there is another fork? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:57:22
I didnt see a freak out :(

@_date: 2017-09-20 18:46:18
Why is this so easy to do... I thought Bitcoin was anti-fragile.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:42:11
Shocker/s.  Or they could just buy any other foreign currency.
