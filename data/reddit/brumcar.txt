Also, how do you know how many people are using non-renewable energy sources?

You should probably look all this up before looking into buying some...

Do your research before you come into a subreddit to berate the very thing it focuses on. Bitcoin isn't just a "get rich quick" scheme, it's much much more than that

They didn't directly reference it, it was a hyperlink where it said something along the lines of "more powerful than the top 500 super computers combined".
Bitcoin is using tonnes of electricity, yes. But there are much more energy intensive things around that are causing much bigger environmental issues than Bitcoin. It's like saying "stop using combustion engine powered cars!! There are electric cars for a reason!!", they're just not affordable, the same way renewable energy sources aren't.
I'm sure 99% of the people on this subreddit will agree with me when I say we all want more renewable sources of energy. It's going to benefit everyone (except the oil industry) in the long term - it's just not affordable yet.

Yes, but if you actually read the article that's where they got their numbers from. I can understand where you're coming from - we need to do more for the environment, but this is just another place trying to shoot bitcoin down.
