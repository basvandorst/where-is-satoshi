Nice try, but a few months of panic selling by non-believers and scammers doesn't mean anything for Bitcoin's long-term prospects.  Bitcoin is still the currency of the future, and after Ron Paul is elected in 2012 I wouldn't be surprised if he has the US switch over to Bitcoins from fiat.
@_date: 2011-06-22 00:28:37
Because I'm providing large amounts of evidence of what can be called at best "suspicious activity" occurring with MtGox's reserve funds?
@_date: 2011-06-20 15:16:24


This is plausible, but look at the times when the transfer occurred.  It's hard to pinpoint the exact minute/second it happened due to the nature of bitcoin transactions, but you can tell from the block time that they were right around the time of the hack (1800-2200 GMT).  So yes, it is a possibility, but due to the timing of the transfers, well... I'll leave the interpretation up to you.
edit: It's also at least partially incorrect to say that Mt Gox wasn't consolidated before that account.   was around since May 27th and had a value of 280,000 BTC before merging it all with the 432K account.
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:52:28
Either sell as soon as Mt Gox is back up or be prepared to wait a few months (at least) before cashing out.
@_date: 2011-10-19 15:12:13
A couple reasons:
- Back in May/June, a lot of people bought "mining equipment".  There were quite a few posts about people buying gear running $10,000 USD or more.  Most plans to recoup the investment cost were based on Bitcoins being at least $20 for 6+ months; obviously, that hasn't happened, so a lot of people lost a lot of fiat currency by buying mining.
- Let's not kid ourselves: a lot of the popularity of Bitcoin was due to the fact that it made some people really rich really fast.  For every person who genuinely believes in a cryptocurrency replacing fiat, there are ten people who don't give a shit and just wanted to use Bitcoin to get rich (in fiat money) quick.
Some people say, "I'm glad the get-rich-quick guys are leaving, so only the TRUE Bitcoin believers are around."  The problem with this, is that the less popular Bitcoin is, the less incentive there is for anyone to invest in the infrastructure Bitcoin desperately needs in order to be a success.
So basically, lower exchange rate (or, more specifically, a falling exchange rate) = less people joining in on bandwagon = less people investing in Bitcoin infrastructure = Bitcoin can't progress out of being a niche market.

The 432,000 transfer *to* the account happened on June 12, well before the hack (but apparently after Mt. Gox knew they were compromised).  We can see that there on June 19, that one 432,000 Bitcoin account was distributed amount 9 other accounts--proof of that is in the image that this topic links to.  The million bitcoin question is, *to whom do those 9 other accounts belong?*  At this point, nobody can say for sure.

Why would this trend suddenly be reversed?

@_date: 2011-08-07 01:19:21
True, they'll never "die" full stop; that's the nature of decentralization.  However, you have to figure that if BTC continues on a downward trend and gets to &lt; $1 (I'm saying IF, not that it definitely will), it will no longer profitable for Mt Gox et al to pay for hosting fees.  The exchanges being shut down would more or less mark the end of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:13:43
Is this really a surprise?  Odds are the next difficulty drop is going to be even more severe; for many people, $6-7 is the cutoff for when mining stops being profitable due to electricity costs, and I'm guessing BTC isn't going to rebound that high in the next two weeks.

Do you have any evidence of this, e.g. a link to a transaction?  As far as I can tell those 50k bitcoins have remained snugly in their wallets since the hack.  I value MagicalTux's word as much as salt at this point.


The same reason they lied about their database not being leaked (and now, who did the leaking), they lied about the CSRF vulnerability on their site (even going so far as to accuse users of not doing safe security practices!), etc.  They're a business that relies on the confidence of its users to operate.  Look at it this way: if Mt Gox opens tomorrow, saying "don't worry guys all your bitcoins are safe", either a) it's business as usual, which is doubtful, or b) people in a panick start selling off bitcoins.  In either case, Mt. Gox **makes a ton of money** off the commission from every transaction.  It's only when people try withdrawing Bitcoins from Mt. Gox that problems will arise.
On the other hand, if they did get hacked and came out and said there were no more Bitcoins in Mt. Gox, nobody would buy from Mt. Gox because they know there aren't the bitcoins to back up their transactions.
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:40:32


Well, yeah.
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:22:28
Fair enough.  I still think that MtGox has lost control of (most of) their BTC reserves, but it'd be a twist if they actual had lost them on June 12, far earlier than anyone expected.
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:40:00
Oops, I totally misread your original post.  Yeah I completely agree with you.  MtGox's behavior is definitely indicative that something went really, really wrong on their side.

You're completely missing the point of what he means by fundamental value.  Say you woke up in a world tomorrow where everyone but you had disappeared.  You could still live in a house, you could still eat food, you could still write on a piece of paper, could still forge things out of iron and steel and gold, etc.  That's what fundamental value is: what kind of utility you can get out of it if it were otherwise "worthless".
So what about Bitcoins?  They have scarcity, yes, but *fundamentally* they're worthless.  You can't do anything with a Bitcoin, it's just a number.  That's his point: it's hard to dictate where Bitcoin will end up because it's just a set of numbers which have no inherent value.
@_date: 2011-10-17 15:04:23
Just like the time to buy was at $13.  And $11.  And $9.  And $7.  And $5.
I'm sure there will be a dead cat bounce back whenever the current decline hits bottom, but let's not kid ourselves... the days of speculating that Bitcoin will be worth $50 in 2012 are over.  At this point, we should be speculating whether or not Bitcoin will be worth $0.50 in 2012.

And how do we determine who owns which Namecoin?  By the block chain.  How do we know that the block chain is a valid one?  Because a majority (&gt;50%) agree that it's the valid one.
They're not defrauding anyone at all.  They're simply taking over the block chain and using majority rule (51% computing power) to make their chain the valid one.  If that's fraud, what's to stop me from saying, "Hey, I started my own local Bitcoin block chain where I own all the Bitcoins, but all these other people used their superior computing power to take over the network."  It's more or less the same concept.
@_date: 2011-06-23 05:01:16


Why?  What's there to investigate?  If 500,000 BTC were stolen--e.g. transferred from the MtGox to another wallet--what possible recourse do they have?  None.  You can't rollback a transaction that's "in the wild" like that.  If they went to any authorities, well, first they'd have to admit to running an illegal securities exchange... so that's not really an option.  
So what's options are left?  Deflect blame, make up a variety of reasons for why the hack happened (SQL injection! Security auditor!  Financial auditor!), etc, all the while you're prepping to take the money and run.  I'd say that their behavior is exactly what I'd be doing if I didn't have any of the BTC.

3) Rebound to 75% of the previous value
4) Back to step 1
If you're looking to make a quick buck I would try and buy when it hits around $2.50, which I would guess is going to be the low, and then sell when it jumps back to $3.50 or so.
@_date: 2011-09-13 19:51:35
Then there's zero point to this.  "VoteCoin" would be no more anonymous than typical voting because the government issuer would be able to keep records of who was issued which coin.  If you allow users to transfer coins among each other you might as well sanction being able to buy and sell votes.
Voting systems can already automatically tally.  This would do nothing but introduce unnecessary overhead.

Bitcoins are really, really good at one thing: purchasing illegal goods mostly anonymously over the internet.  Bitcoin makes it really easy to buy, say, drugs over the internet.  And while yes, you could *potentially* be found out by analyzing the block chain/MtGox getting subpoenaed/etc, no authorities are going to waste that time and money on finding a guy who ordered a dimebag online.
The problem is that you have a lot of people who think Bitcoins should be good at things that they're not good at.  And by that, I mean "buying things that aren't illegal goods."  Every exchange of BTC for non-illegal goods has been extremely gimmicky and belabored.  A guy selling his motorcycle for BTC isn't stimulating the economy, it's a publicity stunt, especially if he cashes out to USD as soon as he receives it.
Currently, there is absolutely no reason to buy a pair of headphones online for BTC when you could use a credit card.  Currently, there's absolutely no reason to buy a book from a store with BTC when you could use cash.
So the only people who end up genuinely caring about bitcoin are:
1) People who buy drugs online.
2) People who think the world economy and fiat currencies will collapse and Bitcoin will be the one true currency remaining, so they "invest" in BTC as essentially a get-rich-quick scheme.
3) Speculators and traders who mainly take advantage of the people in 2).
4) Scammers who mainly take advantage of people in 2) and 3).
Bitcoin did a really awesome thing in making one of the few digital items that have intrinsic uniqueness and can't be readily duplicated.  There are flaws, but the idea is sound.  However, it's been ruined by people who have fooled themselves into believing that BTC is the next big thing and will put their children through college when a single BTC is worth a million dollars.
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:19:18
You're right, that doesn't prove anything.  Again, I have no reason to believe MagicalTux, and given his track record I don't think anyone else should be trusting him either.  If he's really in control of the money, he should be able to say "I'm transferring X BTC from wallet A to wallet B", and then do it.  Just saying "oh I already did some 50k transfers" proves nothing, since transfers are public knowledge.

There is no exploit, there is (probably) not a fix.  This is by design; it's a *decentralized* currency.  How do you determine the validity of a unit of currency when there's no central authority?  Majority consensus, which is exactly what Bitcoin et. al. do.  The only way to prevent something like this would be to designate people as authorities about the validity of blockchains; in which case, you no longer have a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:54:00
**UPDATE:** 
Most have heard of the "432,000 bitcoin transaction" that occurred yesterday.  Many have been quick to dismiss it is as routine transferring by Mt. Gox.  I don’t know if the transaction chain lends itself to believing that, and there’s some pretty damning evidence if you follow the money trail.
As you can see in the image, the 432,000 bitcoins were swapped through multiple accounts so that 8 accounts hold 50,000 Bitcoins, and one account holds the rest.  Check out  for yourself, at the bottom of the page.  None of the accounts containing 50,000 coins have been touched yet.  Interesting on its own, but the real fun begins when you take a look at the account that holds the leftover amount of 32077 bitcoins. 
If you start clicking around on the “sent” links, you’ll see that money is changing accounts like crazy.  The important thing to note?  None of these accounts had ever been seen before the hack.  They all have a first sighting time of during or just after the hack, and there’s a lot of them.  In the end, the money ends up at this address:  with a cool 42,000 bitcoins.
I’ll let you draw your own conclusions.  I’ll say this: Mt. Gox could easily prove all the doubters wrong by consolidating all of these bitcoins back into one account, which is what they had before.  Until that happens, it’s anyone’s guess as to who actually controls the coins.

Have you not noticed how Bitcoin, despite being a decentralized currency, has naturally gravitated toward centralized systems (Mtgox/Bitomat/Tradehill/Mybitcoin/etc etc)?
Maybe the idea of a decentralized, unregulated currency that is in widespread daily use is just a bad idea that doesn't fit the natural structure of human order.  Maybe that's why people don't try to buy a burrito at Taco Bell with gold.

The first permanent currency was... I dunno.  Gold?  Salt?
Bitcoin is pretty far from permanent.  It requires electricity, computers, and the internet--all of which are *massive* amounts of infrastructure relative to other currencies.  If the internet were to suddenly disappear, Bitcoins would disappear.  If a terrorist attack took out the electric grid, bitcoins would be useless.
@_date: 2011-09-03 16:20:16
Arrested and prosecuted?  If this ever got to a court of law (which it won't) the defense would win this case.  Easily.
Number one line of defense: where's the proof the recipient was Ben Davis?  Bitcoin is, by its nature, anonymous.  The owner of that wallet is not linked to Ben Davis in any way besides him having access to its private keys.  In order to solidly prove that the recipient was Ben Davis, you'd have to go to the one point where you can associate a person with their wallet: the exchanges.  Does the Bitcoin community really want MtGox giving its transaction history to the government, over a $5,000 mistake?
Also keep in mind that, if you managed to successfully argue that Bitcoin were a currency or otherwise had value, you'd suddenly have MtGox et al running unauthorized securities exchanges.  Not to mention that the IRS (or Japanese equivalent) would be very interested to hear about these sources of income.
Bottom line is, Ben Davis is acting untouchable, because he really is; there's no way that the guy who accidentally sent him 500BTC is going to recover it through a court of law.  Live by anonymity, die by anonymity.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:25:27
The point of Bitcoin is that it's deregulated.  First you say that it's OK that I'm not allowed to buy Bitcoins which may have been "stolen" (and how do we know that they were really stolen?  How do we know some idiot just didn't make a typo when trying to sell his Bitcoins for $20?).  Then you say it's okay if Mt. Gox makes it so you're not allowed to sell Bitcoins under a certain price.  Then you say it's okay if Mt. Gox doesn't allow transactions with people suspected of selling illicit goods.
It's a very slippery slope.

This sort of thing is somewhat common for stocks because things *actually happen* when the price dips, i.e. stocks tumble because a company is unprofitable, so the company has lay-offs, does restructuring, closes outlets, etc. to bring itself back to profitability, and then the stocks regain their value.  Sometimes, the stocks never regain their value and you lose all your money: see Borders.
On the other hand, with Bitcoin, there is no restructuring or fundamental changes that can be done when the price goes down; it is what it is.  The only way the value of Bitcoin can return to June/July levels is if there is another speculative bubble similar to the first one.

I'm not Nostradamus, but I'll ballpark it and say by the end of 2013 Bitcoins will be worth anywhere between $200 and $250.  Since they're only $12 right now, you're looking at an enormous return on investment; far more than any typical Jewish bank will give you.

You're right, but lots of evidence is circumstantial.  That doesn't make it any less valid.

You don't always get the smoking gun DNA sample you're looking for.

To make it simple, we'll lowball it and call the time differential between mining + merging 2 years (730 days).  So assuming Mt. Gox chose a completely random day to merge wallets, that's a 1/730 ~= 0.137% chance that Mt. Gox happened to merge wallets on the day before the hack.  There's coincidence, and then there's evidence.

If you consider the real value of Bitcoin to be the protocol, then the Bitcoin tokens themselves are next to worthless; the protocol is easily duplicated (and in fact, has already been duplicated in Litecoin et al), and a duplicate protocol sponsored by a large entity such as the US Government or even a major bank would receive far more mainstream acceptance that Bitcoin.

What's to debunk? He's totally right that mining (and consequently, operating the Bitcoin network) requires a lot of energy.

Diversification. $10 in fiat will have roughly the same purchasing power in a year as it does today. $10 in bitcoin may be worth $1000 in a year, or it may be worth $0.01. Nobody really knows.


Volatility and purchasing power. A $5 fiat footlong will still cost $5 next year. If you use BTC to purchase that footlong, even if you get a discount, next year the purchasing power of those BTC may be $500. For an extreme example, see the [2 million dollar pizza]( which I guess is more like 4 million now.

No, they weren't. New exchanges would have been created regardless. In fact, the only competing exchange of any significance that was made within 6 months of that hack was Tradehill, which is now defunct.
A major exchange (well, at the time, the *only* exchange) getting hacked and shutting down for 3 days is NOT A GOOD THING. This was in 2011; there was an entire year and a half where Bitcoin did nothing but decrease in value before the creation of Satoshidice sparked a new wave of interest and snowballing media hype.
Similarly, China saying "you can't use Bitcoin as currency" IS NOT A GOOD THING, especially when such a high percentage of the market is IN CHINA, but tried so hard to spin it I thought I was watching Fox News.

The problem is, you can't rely on network effect for anything long term. Friendster had the network before MySpace, which had the network before Facebook. Fark.com had the network before Digg before Reddit... etc. Can the network effect will give Bitcoin the virtual currency edge for the next 3-5 years? Sure. Does the current network effect mean Bitcoin will be *the* payment processing system in 7, 10 years? I'm not so sure. Given recent history, a technology platform being dominant for over a decade is unlikely.
Also, from a payment protocol perspective, most bitcoin-based currencies are more or less interchangeable. Currently when a merchant uses Bitpay to accept Bitcoin, as most do, it's transparent and they receive USD. To them, it doesn't matter if the customer is sending Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Scamcoin. In that sense, it's very easy to build up the infrastructure for altcoins; a small number of coin-&gt;USD companies would have to add in a bit of code, and there would have to be liquidity, and that's about it.

Any of the big businesses that Bitpay has landed recently are not keeping anything other than a small percent of what the receive in Bitcoin. And I guarantee the amount of business that Microsoft and Newegg do outweighs sites like Grass Hill Alpacas and Knives4Bitcoin by several orders of magnitude.

1) Overstock already does hold some percentage of Bitcoins as BTC because the CEO is a Libertarian "true believer". Not sure about Tiger Direct.
"Well, if you look at merchants accepting bitcoin most of them immediately sells off their bitcoin, AKA converts them to fiat. AFAIK what this does is reduce the price of bitcoins because of some mechanism i haven't quite groked yet(enlighten me?)."
I have a Bitcoin, I buy something from Tiger Direct via Coinbase. Coinbase takes my Bitcoin and gives Tiger Direct the equivalent value in USD. In order to minimize risk, Coinbase immediately sells (most of, if not all) of the bitcoin I just used on an exchange. Effectively, buying something with Bitcoin is the same as selling it on an exchange.
2) For other, smaller companies, it's not worth the hassle. Virtually every merchant who "accepts Bitcoin" really just accepts fiat through Bitpay or Coinbase. Given the recent IRS ruling, a smaller shop would never want to accept and store Bitcoin, since it's an accounting nightmare. Also, it's a pretty tough sell: "Hey, the price of Bitcoin has been falling too much, so could you stop selling some and instead risk your business' profits on a high volatility asset?"
3) "Getting business to understand this and somehow getting them under the bitcoin umbrella and ethos isn't that stupid is it?"
Honestly: yes, it is pretty stupid. In general, businesses exist to be profitable, they don't exist to promote the Bitcoin agenda. Most businesses that are accepting Bitcoin don't even give a shit about it, they just wanted the publicity that came out of it.

This is a really, really, *really* bad sign for BitPay. For those unfamiliar with tech startups, here's why: when you receive venture capital money (as BitPay has), your job isn't to necessarily make a profit or figure out a viable business model. Your job is to grow, grow, **grow**. Nothing else matters, because you can figure out your business model after you have customers, or so the Silicon Valley logic goes.
Obviously there's quite a number of metric by which you can measure growth, but the top two that businesses use are revenue and employee headcount. When either of those metrics are going *down* during the growth face, your start-up is basically fucked. In this case, Bitpay laid off approximately 13% of its 70-person staff (getting this number via its Wikipedia page, which lists it as "60+"). That is an *extremely* bad sign.
BitPay may be in dire straits.

Is it already that time again?

If you can find me any articles or papers that say that laying off over 10% of your employees is a sign of healthy business growth, I'd love to see them.

You sound like a petulant child and most of your "refutations" are just speculation or angst-filled ad hom attacks.

... and that's exactly what Bitcoin is, isn't it? Besides buying illicit goods and providing relative anonymity, there's really no use case for the average consumer to use Bitcoin. Advertising doesn't fix that.

The good news is Bitcoin won't be around in 5 years, much less 40, making the point moot.

Hey Mr. Matthew N Wright, stop spamming links to your shitty magazine's terrible articles.  Thanks in advance.

Bitcoins are a great investment opportunity for anyone who likes to see their net worth decrease by 66% in approximately 9 months.  They're also great for laundering money so you can buy illegal drugs over the internet.  To obtain Bitcoins, click your heels together three times while saying "Ron Paul 2012" and Bruce Wagner will appear and whisk you away to Pattaya, Thailand, wherein you will receive all the bitcoins you'll ever need.

"About breakeven" is doublespeak for "I lost more money than I care to count so I just assume that I broke even"

I guess the Linode/Bitcoinica hack was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Lots of people realizing that despite the mini-rally in January due to the Good Wife episode, the market for BTC has shrunk considerably since last summer and running a BTC-oriented business is no longer profitable.
@_date: 2012-04-07 19:02:58
It's pretty funny seeing all the Bitcoin backlash against this idea.  No surprise, though; one of the questions nobody in the Bitcoin community could ever answer was, "If a large corporation or state wanted to use an e-currency, why wouldn't they make their own instead of using Bitcoin?"  And the answer, as we've found out, is that they won't.  Mintchip will be the first of many electronic, cryptography-based, state-sponsored currencies that will result in Bitcoin's obsolescence. 
@_date: 2012-04-11 21:14:14
Another hilariously misinformed Time article.  MintChip isn't a digital currency, because it's not a currency.  It's a method of exchanging other (fiat) currencies, limited to CAD right now but theoretically expandable to other currencies and even commodities--Bitcoin itself included.
This MintChip vs Bitcoin fight keeps coming up, but they aren't even in the same problem space.  Bitcoin is digital gold.  MintChip is digital cash.

Because it's that Google would rather create its own currency than adopt Bitcoin.

Wow, that sucks.  It's almost as if the fact that you can steal hundreds of thousands of dollars by copy and pasting a file is a design flaw in Bitcoin.

1) What evidence do you have that the hardware will be hacked?
2) Let's assume that the hardware is hackable, but not trivially so (e.g. you can't just open up the card and say "I now have a million dollars").  How would this be any different from, say, counterfeit bills or counterfeit coins?  Fiat currency works despite counterfeit bills being possible, why would it not work despite counterfeit mintchip cards being available?

Another great scam by Matthew N. Wright, the guy behind such other scams as "Bitcoin Magazine" (pay him bitcoins to make his vaporware magazine) and "Bitcoin Business Bureau" (pay him bitcoins to... do nothing)

I know, I was referring to Mt. Gox, which regardless of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, still handles over 80% of Bitcoin&lt;-&gt;fiat exchanges and is run by an individual.

You really think the ~20% drop that happened after Tradehill pulled the plug was a coincidence?
@_date: 2012-04-19 20:00:56
I don't know, but I certainly hope the type of people who invest in Bitcoin continues to do so.  Since its inception Bitcoin has been a constant supply of hilarious schadenfreude, and I'd hate to see that source of comedy disappear.

The difference is you don't have a group of zealous supporters who are encouraging local businesses to accept gold bars, or think that gold bars will eventually overtake fiat currency.

Nah, they'll fall even further.  Prices steadily increased for a bit because people thought The Good Wife episode would bring a spike in interest (and prices), but it didn't... it's been slowly falling until yesterday, when Tradehill broke and it started collapsing.  Even after the dust is settled coins will probably be at $2 per, and before it gets there you'll see &lt;$2, maybe even &lt;$1 coins.

gee you mean matthew n wright, the guy who
1) went to Korea to start an unaccredited English teaching school,
2) created "Bitcoin Business Bureau" which was a scheme to try and get people to send him bitcoins for nothing in return,
3) started taking "pre-orders" for the physical copy of Bitcoin Magazine but delaying its creation for months and months
is a scammer????????  Never would've guessed.

Because Bitcoiners who invested heavily (both financially and emotionally) into Bitcoin are completely shocked by the revelation that if a large entity such as a corporation or nation wants to use a digital currency, they will create their own rather than piggyback off one used primarily for black-market goods whose primary financial institution is run by a Japanese foreign exchange student.
