This is exactly why I started with Multibit, but after a year or so I began looking into other desktop clients and began running Bitcoin-QT. That's when I finally discovered the difference and I haven't touched Multibit since. Running a full node is not a big deal. I'm happy to be doing my part for the community.

If you have UPnP enabled on your router, Bitcoin-QT is probably handling this for you. Right now I have 47 active connections and I haven't had to configure anything beyond accepting defaults. I can see that Bitcoin-QT has multiple connection through port 8333 on my host.

I just switched and confirm this. Bitcoin Core would take like 20+ minutes to start. Bitcoin XT took around 20 seconds or even less.

I'd be super grateful if you could explain your opinion why you think a position against racism might be politically left? Thanks in advance!

The only power the government really has, is the monopoly right to initiate the use of force.

Down voted initially then googled it. Removed down vote. That was some pretty despicable stuff you said, Olivier. Hope you've changed your ways.

That is the whole point with Civil Asset Forfieture. It's not you who needs to be under suspicion of a crime, it's your stuff.

The bill splitting feature to show off the east of making payments with Bitcoin (i.e. Generate a QR code with all the payment information needed for someone else to instantly scan and click send) is the main use case, yes. 
For the friends who don't use Bitcoin, just tallying the amount by clicking on the rows of a digitized bill is way better than typing numbers into a calculator. They'll see for themselves how clunky it is to pay you back with fiat compared to scanning a QR code.
Also you should highlight the rows that have been paid so that you can keep track of who's items are who's.

After a person has paid the bill with fiat or bitcoin, splitting the bill should be done as follows: Your app should be able to scan and digitize the text in the bill so that it can list and tally the values of all the items. Once it's digitized, prompt the user to select what items they wish to tally for each guest's sub-bill. Once they have selected the items, click a button that generates a QR code with the amount to send to your wallet (or fiat amount). Rinse and repeat until all sub-bills are settled. 
I'd pay for that app. Be forgiving about the character set being used. Don't over-process trying to get the names of the dishes correct. It's the amounts on the bill you care about. Remember that most of non-English speaking European countries use a comma , to mean a decimal point . And a decimal point to split 000 denominations.

You should be able to file a complaint against them at the Swedish Comsumer Protection Agency here.

I think EUR might be a good currency to hedge against in the short term since it looks like the whole Eurozone is about to collapse...

motto of the story: don't trust the conversion price in the app if you're going to make a transfer

If you don't have income or liabilities in any of those currencies, then I guess it's all just currency speculation?
There is also a small caveat... 
"CoinJar can only process Australian dollar bank withdrawals and deposits."
Not sure how that affects the overall value of hedging?
