Used to be a bit racist though : "Given the inefficiencies of what DC laughingly calls the criminal justice system, I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal."

Zooville? Hmm, I don't know about that, sounds like a pretty generous interpretation.

Lol, that's pretty incredible. I guess the congressman had no idea what was being published in his newsletter, yeah that's plausible.

That's a pretty generous, I don't know though...from the Wikipedia regarding his newsletters : Another newsletter suggested that black activists who wanted to rename New York City after Martin Luther King, Jr. should instead rename it "Welfaria," "Zooville," "Rapetown," "Dirtburg," or "Lazyopolis."
Maybe he has changed and matured, but the evidence is clear that he at some point held these bigoted beliefs or at least supported them enough to be printed under his newsletter.
