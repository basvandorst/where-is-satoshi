The quantity of money doesn't matter, just that its supply is stable and reliable.  Mises wrote about this decades ago, and Rothbard has expanded upon it more recently.
If there were to be 12 million bitcoins, or 100 million, it would be the same, as long as the math gives it some predictability, and known stability.
Central banks can never provide those things.

It looks like the App is just wrapping the HTML app, or is this a native implementation?
Update: Saw the github link, and see that it is phonegapped Javascript app.  This is still pretty cool, because unlike Blockchain.info-type wallets, the keys are only stored in local storage, not on hive's servers (even encrypted).  Nice job guys :)

But isn't that using a third-party arbitrator?  That is with 2-of-3, instead of the 2-of-2 scenario I outlined above.  That may be desirable in some situations, but 2-of-2 can be desirable as well.  I just thought the satoshi quote seemed to be something closer to a 2-of-2 scenario than a 2-of-3 with a third-party abitrater.

Stealth addresses can be used off block chain via the payment protocol.  You could email/im the payment directly to the user and they can broadcast it to the network if/when they want.  This essentially lets it be done off block chain until the funds want to be redeemed at least.
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:04:56
I think this would be possible using a multisig address that requires 2 of 2.  You both exchange public keys to generate a multisig address (with leading '3'), and then you send the funds into that address.
Now neither of you can get the funds out unless you both agree.  So if you get frauded, you will never sign an outgoing transaction of that address, but you can't get the funds back, either, without the other party signing a transaction to send them to you as well.
The cool thing is, you actually *could* propose a transaction with 2 outputs, that sends each of you half of the value.  You could send this to the other party signed and leave it up to them to sign.  If they do, you could both compromise by getting half.
I believe all of this is currently possible, but someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-16 23:26:41
Sure, data can be cutoff, but it won't be a valid transaction if data is missing, so it wont be spent.  Either the full data goes out, and it can be sppent (assuming transaction is valid and has enough fees), or the full data doesn't go out and it will be invalid and rejected by the network.
When you add in a middleman such as coinbase its hard to know what they will do in different scenarios.

Thanks for the quick reply!  I had forgotten about that, and you're completely right.  Breadwallet is an SPV standalone client, whereas Hive and other wallets in that vein rely heavily on API's of third parties.

Digital "piracy" isn't a problem, but you've hit the nail on the head that artists and the content-creator-industry as a whole (music, movie, books, etc.) have an archaic business model that they are trying to hold onto.  The current business model is the problem, not 'piracy'.

It's worth noting that FDIC 'insurance' is not really insurance, but is more of a fraudulent confidence system.  At least in the bitcoin ecosystem its possible for companies (and some definitely already do) to get *real* insurance on *Provable* holdings.  This is better than FDIC, IMO, but still not as good as holding coins yourself.

Yes, events like that are not the only catalysts, but look at Argentina.  Look at the economies of Greece, Spain, Portugal (even Italy and France, really).  Negative interest rates on 10 year bonds in Germany say a lot about the rest of the eurorzone as well.
There's a lot of cracks in global economies all over the place.
How Bitcoin reacts during the coming credit crunches and recessions around the world is something I'm very interested in watching.  Maybe THE most interesting thing to watch.  Historically hard moneys like Gold and Silver have done incredibly well during times of debt/credit stress, and I expect they will do the same this time around.  But how Bitcoin reacts is a complete unknown.  Bitcoin has only really gained significant adoption during one of the biggest bear market rally's we've ever seen (2009-present the US Stock markets are up over 100%).  How will it react to a 30, 40, 50% decline in the markets?  How will it react to a strong dollar (yes, I expect the dollar to be strong globally, as we will likely see deflationary pressures from massive credit stress and writedowns), and a credit crunch?
I think it will perform very well, but it will be uncharted territory for the new currency/commodity, so it'll be a great learning experience for this little crypto-experiment :)
@_date: 2014-08-31 23:24:11
Stealth addresses are the closest thing I know of to what you're asking about.  With stealth addresses, you have a shared piece of info (in the stealth address itself) that let's the sender generate a public address that he knows you can generate the private key for, but the sense CANNOT generate or know the private key.

I just want the next release of breadwallet with more privacy features around when it shows my balance.  It is the best wallet for IOS bc it doesn't rely on servers, and is a full Bitcoin client that just talks on the Bitcoin network directly.
I tell everyone I know to use breadwallet, as I think it's the most secure way to store Bitcoin short of a specific hardware device like trezor. I think it's more secure than electrum or armory (at least MUCH simpler than armory for close security) or really any computer based software.
A key point though is to NOT use breadwallet if you jailbreak your iPhone.

I said its not "always" to the moon.  1 year ago the price was ~600-800 and it predicted a price of $30... that's not to the moon.

As long as you move your Bitcoins into your own posession (which you should always do, even with coinbase or anyone else), then why does it matter?
You're only risking small amounts for a short period of time before you move it into your own possession.
If they want to offer this for free, I'll take it while its there :)  Just buy in small amounts so you're never risking a lot at once.

Banks today issue their own currency.  In fact, today, Banks issue most of the currency in the world (no, I'm not talking about central banks).
When A bank issues a loan, its not loaning dollars, its loaning bank notes, which can be deposited into another bank, and then re-loaned out as another banks notes.
The reason all bank notes appear equal (and look like "dollars") today, is because the banks know the Fed will make them whole, so there are no market rates making some bank IOU's cheaper or more expensive than others, because the FED has them backstopped.
It's the same with online wallets like coinbase or bitpay today.  If you have "bitcoins" in coinbase, you really just have an IOU for bitcoin, which is like "coinbase currency".  If the merchant you buy something from with "bitcoins" uses coinbase, and you use coinbase, you're really just exchanging "coinbase currency" until someone pulls it out of coinbase to a real bitcoin address.

In this case I think the main worry is theft of your credit card data, either over the wire (ssl doubts anyone?) or from new eggs storage if they're hacked (and newegg will keep the data forever I'm sure).  Even in a liquidation of newegg there is a bankruptcy process which handles returning money to those owed goods, services, or money.

I hadn't realized that it lets you do this, it seems like it wi prefer confirmed transactions whenever it can.  Unconfirmed are fine to send along but they may take a really long time to get in a block (miners may wait until the first transaction gets confirmed a few times before putting it in their blocks).
@_date: 2014-08-17 00:51:32
Since his coins will be forever monitored, I could definitely see the first move of coins to go, at least mostly, to an orginazation or charity promoting economic freedom, or towards revolutionaries that could use the help in some failing country.  As the transaction will no doubt be noticed, this would be a clever way to spend coins for a 'good cause' while not having to reveal any identity, and could be a vehicle to include a signed message as well. 
I don't think it will happen anytime soon though, no reason to move now, its still only the very beginning stages of this experiment.
It will definitely be very interesting to see!

Ur making my point.  Government corruption is the biggest corruption to worry about.  Bitcoin helps there by giving us a non-confiscatable alternative to their fiat.  If adopted widely, fiat values would fall significantly, restraining what they can get done with it.

Any bank today can NEVER meet all of its contractual agreements (pay out depositor demand deposits). Because of this, it is fraud.  Any other business entering into millions of agreements and contracts that it knows it cannot meet would be shut down.

I could see freshly
Minted coins being valuable for privacy/anonymity, but I can also see how old (not spent/moved in a long time) could be valuable as they will command high priority (and thus lower/no fees).
As a practical matter though, to transfer "old" coins to someone else makes them not old anymore, so their value is only for the current holder and is not "tradeable" to someone else short of exchanging the private key, which is risky for the buyer.
Also, could bitcoins known to be from the government (Silk Road busy for example), be tainted and worth more (or less)?  It's an interesting thought.
For now it seems like a bitcoin is a bitcoin is a bitcoin for the most part.
@_date: 2014-08-19 06:04:49
Aproval is not so much required as much as it is part of standard accounting practices to mark the assets on your books at market value.
The treasury has legally allowed the banks to NOT have to do this since 2009 by suspending those portions of the accounting rules (and some others as well).  These are STILL suspended, so the banks are basically legally allowed (actually encouraged) to lie about the value of the assets on their books.  And this behavior is government sanctioned and approved!
That's why its so hard (impossible) to actually determine how bad a specific bank is really doing...you don't know how leveraged they are, or how good their assets are. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 00:04:57

I guess if its a coinbase error thats possible, but using normal wallet software with bitcoins in your control, that's not possible.  Either it happened or it didn't.
If it's a coinbase issue, more reason to move your bitcoins into your posession as soon as you buy, rather than keep them with a third party.
@_date: 2014-08-24 18:13:23
If you have old unspent outputs, it should be pretty easy to make a "high priority" transaction which would require no fees.
I generally don't have any problem finding ways to make high priority transactions that won't need fees, but when I do, I'm ok with the $0.05 fee.  When you average it out over all the free transactions, it's really not a high price to pay to opt out of the banking system.
@_date: 2014-09-05 03:55:55
Unfair taxation is redundant.
For asset forfeiture, look at Ross Ulbricht, they arrested him and confiscated his computers and STILL couldn't get access to all of his bitcoins.  For all we know, he may still own thousands of bitcoins that the government can't access.  Governments just can't take your bitcoins if you protect them properly...they may not be able to even know that you 'have' them.
Bitcoin can alleviate one of the biggest social problems in developed countries, which is theft via inflation and the printing of money.  Bitcoin interest rates cannot be 'price fixed' by a central bank etiher, and the interest rate is one of the most important prices in the economy to send the right signals to investors.  In developing areas, bitcoin can give people safety in knowing that no one can 'steal' their wealth, either via a breakin/robbery, or via money printing/corrupt governments.  In some ways, bitcoin self-enforces property rights on itself when private keys are properly managed and stored securely.
In terms of corruption, I'm not sure bitcoin eliminates corruption (nothing does), but if you can't print money, the practical things that the corrupt people can do is severely restricted, imo, because they still have to get money from the free market to do the things they want to achieve.
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:19:56
Everything fluctuates.  You say commodities fluctuate, but you mean in respect to some currency, b/c you've chosen to fix that.  You can chose to fix the commodity and look at the price of the currency in that commodity, and now its reversed.  All prices fluctuate, and all prices are relative.
I'm not disagreeing that bitcoin is more volatile than the dollar (for now), just pointing out that gold or silver fluctuate just as much as the dollar b/c its all relative based on which value you 'fix'.

Bitcoin is not anonymous by default, but there are definitely ways to be more anonymous with it.  I wouldn't say that it *can't* be anonymous.  There are trustless mixers already, and there are lots of people working on other (trustless, and non-trustless) solutions to anonymity.
It seems like what is likely to be true is that the default for bitcoin will not be anonymity, and that anonymity will be a choice that you likely have to pay a little more for (via more complex transactions + fees).
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:47:38

Funny that everything you mentioned as an example of illegal income involves bribing government officials, who are the corrupt ones.
Even still, this is petty corruption compared to the multi billion (trillion?) dollar corruptions that bail out or banks, war profiteer, murder millions of people around the world (formprofit), imprison people for victimless crimes, etc.  these things are all funded via deficit spending and the ability to print money and create inflation.  If we had to be taxed to pay for all these, the tax rate would be higher than 100%, because the money doesn't exist!
Edit: to be clear, I'm not arguing against the government here, I'm just saying that a sound money, especially one that can be evasive of government claws, like bitcoin can keep the government and it's massive corruption/violence machine somewhat in check.
@_date: 2014-08-23 22:12:46
I don't think bitcoin being undervalued and there being a stock market bubble are mutually exclusive.
I think we've got both.  The bubble is beyond the stock market, too.  It's a credit and risk bubble, where everyone in almost all asset classes have been pushed into high risk investments without properly accounting for those risks.
I personally think Bitcoin is undervalued in the long term, but I'm very curious and interested to see what happens with bitcoin when this valuation/risk bubble bursts.  I certainly expect gold and silver to do well during that credit-deflationary event, but how bitcoin behaves in such an environment nobody has ever witnessed before :)
@_date: 2014-09-05 23:04:04

@_date: 2014-12-25 23:04:01
I had a similar thought, but instead of giving out bitcoins, and dealing with the problems of distributing fairly and cheaply, since bitcoin has a fixed amount, one (government or philanthropist) could just provably destroy their bitcoins, and that would make all other bitcoins have more value, which is maybe the "fairest" way to distribute the value evenly amongst Bitcoin users.

This is a description of a traditional bank, which really no longer exists anymore.  Their main purpose today (pretty much globally) is to create currency, or 'currency-like' substitutes (bank notes) which are virtually universally treated the same as real currency by everone.

I think you're wrong on both counts.  DarkWallet's will be decentralized and trustless.  Blockchain's is (currently) centralized, but trustless, meaning that they cannot steal your money, they just acts as a centralized place to find others looking to mix as well.
The biggest issue is not that bitcoin doesn't support, or can't be made (more) anonymous, it's that we need better user interfaces, and smarter wallets to support these things.  They are rapidly coming.  We are still in the very very very early stages.

I think the corruption with the biggest magnitude of negative impact is corruption of government "officials", who maintain their power and achieve their ends via the printing presses, without which they couldn't carry out most of the things they get away with.  
You seem to be talking about people (I.e non government officials) "laundering" money, which is not even corruption.  Money laundering is designed to stop people from hiding "illegal" sources of income, but in reality no voluntary exchange of money between two people is unjust.  I would argue that money laundering laws and their enforcement is the corruption, not people with "illegal" money from voluntary transactions with others.

You enter into a demand-deposit contract with the bank, where the bank says your deposits will be available on-demand.  When in reality, the bank can never, at any point in time, honor all of these contracts with all of these customers.  This is fraud and a ponzi scheme.

I've wondered the same thing.  I assume it's so they have fewer keys on their webservers, but at the same time, it seems like they could just have one HD Master Public Key safely on their servers to generate billions and billions of addresses and never need to reuse any.
Seems like re-use would actually be more complicated, b/c they have to time-box things and make sure they don't re-use them in X minutes, even if it hasn't received the payment they were expecting, etc.

Curious to know your thoughts on security of breadwallet, which is native obj-c iOS app, and the new Hive iOS app ( which is Javascript-based using phone gap.
Even on the Hive wallet, I don't believe the wallet is ever stored on a server, its just stored in local html5 storage (I believe), and can only be recovered from your backup mnemonic phrase.
I'm not sure if there are implications as to what other applications can access that storage, or how good the sandboxing is on something like that (obviously I'm talking about on a non-jailbroken phone) compared to the iOS keychain.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:11:01
Read their README on github, it explains t better than I can, but basically the security
Model of the OS on iOS is far superior to android (for non-jail broken iPhones), so keeping your keys in the iOS keychain is actually maybe the safest place to store bitcoin for the average user.  More secure than on a typical computer for most ppl.
@_date: 2014-09-05 06:28:03
And yes, I'm saying bitcoin would make that better, because they can steal your gold and your silver and your fiat, but they can't take your bitcoins if you hold them properly.

I do have a friend who bought a few full BTC at the ~1200 mark and he's still holding.  I didn't buy any up there, but pretty sure I'd be doing the same thing.
But also, in the grand scheme of things, you're talking about 'holding' for ~7-8 months...that's nothing.  When you're trying to capture broader trends, predicting changes in a 6-8month window is virtually impossible.
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:21:21
You have a valid concern with point  but circle is no worse than any other 'official' exchange (coinbase, etc.).
For point about freezing assets, that's why I say no one should leave bitcoins in any of these accounts.  Do small transactions and move them out to wallets you own as quickly as you can.

DarkWallet is the only one that supports them ATM as far as I know, but they are not expected to be DarkWallet only if they catch on.
The implementation/details of stealth wallet are open, but most clients haven't implemented them yet as there is still ongoing discussion as to what the best way to accomplish what stealth addresses accomplish (other proposals, etc., which are holding up wallet developers from implementing anything yet).
I'm hoping that some solution becomes agreed upon soon and we can start getting things done in wallets :)
@_date: 2014-12-25 18:37:32
Interesting, thanks for this!  It makes sense b/c the normal breadwallet only looks for addresses in its bip32 chain, so would have to rescan the whole blockchain to find the wallet address.  It probably opts for blockchain to not make a sweep take 10+ minutes.
Thank you!
Of course, no one can fully audit everything they use, as I'm sure you can't/don't do either.  That's why we have these discussions and distribute the research/investigations across people interested in various things. Now I know :)

There are known problems with this.  I think if you use the ledger on the same computer a handful of times, any malware can easily reverse engineer the entire card.  I can't find the link atm, but this has been talked about and should be easy to find.

I guess we haven't hit the bottom.
@_date: 2015-01-01 04:53:19
I second this majorly.  I would say buy with coinbase or circle (I use both, prefer coinbase), and move the coins out to breadwallet on your non-jail broken iPhone (important!).
With an iMac and iPhone only, I think that is the safest you can go for a "usable" wallet (i.e avoiding hard to spend paper/cold wallets). The next step would be a trezor hardware wallet to increase security.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:30:46
The same way any other hardware company/entrepreneur makes money.  Making the best product with the best reputation and at a good, competetive price.
@_date: 2015-01-01 04:57:06
Though as hardware wallets go, ledger has some big issues since it has no screen.  I think breadwallet is close to just as secure, and a trezor is the way to go with respect to hardware wallets, though it does cost more than ledger.

No fractional reserve banks are solvent.  This goes for not just Greece, but Germany, and the US.  This is why a run on the banks is ALWAYS a fear of banks.  If everyone tried to get their money out in Germany, the US, or anywhere else, it wouldn't all be there.  No banks today are solvent ever.

I think users have an affect on the price as well.  whether they are trying to profit from the price or not, their choices and decisions affect the market, arguably more so than the "speculators" but it's hard to say with such an illiquid market.

My opinion is that this argument is wrong.  What is one of the most price-deflationary industries today?  Microchips, transistors, and electronics in general.  This industry is cut-throat and incredibly competitive.  Billions, if not Trillions of dollars of investment goes into this industry. Innovation and competition is rampant, and yet prices fall like a brick.
The paradox of thrift is not a paradox at all.  When the prices of goods get cheaper, consumers will buy them.  That's why sale's work.  You can't hold off on buying groceries or a new car forever, just like people still buy computers even though they *know* they will be cheaper in a few months.

What tough lesson?  I read Satoshi's paper in 2009 and have been through many ups and downs.  I Plan to hold Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin, and have no grand delusions that either of them will succeed or fail -- just looking to invest in the technology.  I feel Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original version of bitcoin, and objectively less of a change (if not no change at all from the original protocol, really) than something like Segwit.  I'm happy to invest in both and let the market speak, though.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:38:51
Price deflation is the natural state of an economy/society who's productivity is rising.  Cheaper prices is good for everyone, and competition + productivity increases relentlessly drive us towards lower prices.
Inflationists like the central banks use this to their advantage, because they can inflate away some of our value, and when the economy is doing well and productivity is increasing, its very hard to notice.
Deflation is what a libertarian mindset should want, specifically price deflation.

@_date: 2015-02-05 01:45:33
I think it's fine for them to try this.  My assumption would be that the wallet either won't gain traction because of it, or it will be forked (very easily, I'm sure) with a version that doesn't have this fee, if people find the wallet valuable.
I don't think the "force people to pay" model will work, and I don't think a non-open source model will work.
The great thing is, there is a demand for easy to use, secure, wallets, so the market will provide them in whatever way makes sense.  Look at breadwallet, electrum, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:28:32
I think this would be possible with some form of a protocol that would allow the consumer + merchant wallets to talk, and build a single transaction together, where the merchant includes an input that will basically pay the transaction fee, and the rest of the UTXO back to itself, along with an input from the customer for the cost of the item/good.
I'm not sure if the current BIP70 payment protocol supports this, but either way it should be do-able with a standard protocol like this.  I'm not sure I've seen a working demo/implementation of this though.
@_date: 2016-07-01 07:31:42
To be clear, they haven't added withdrawal limits!  The $10k withdrawal limits have been there from day 1, but previously they also had deposit, and account balance limits to match.  This means you could never have an account value above $10k.  So if you have $5k in BTC, and $5k in cash, they wouldn't let you deposit anymore money.
As of now, you can continue to deposit and have as much as you want in the account, and only the $10k/day withdrawal limit still stands.
I'm not saying the withdrawal limit is a good thing, it's not a change or anything new (I've had a coinbase account since they opened their doors).

Bitcoin is definitely incredibly risky right now, but I think the optionality of it is very good, *especially* for a young kid.  At that age, higher risks are ok and can easily be overcome.  A car won't be worth anything at his retirement either, so a 100% loss in BTC is the same long-run outcome as buying the car.
I think this is a pretty informative, level-headed article, that touches on the advantageous optionality that bitcoin offers at the present time.  
Are there large risks with bitcoin?  Sure, but it may also offer one of the best risk/reward profiles of a lifetime.  Chances like that don't come often.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:51:26
The typical answer to this is always the same:  dollar cost average.  You can't predict the future, so if you think it's going up long-term, just add exposure slowly as you can, averaging your cost over time.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:52:08
The prices *are* dropping (and will drop) if you view them in price per GH/s.  It has definitely been getting cheaper per unit of power, and from everything we know about chips and electronics, the trend should be that they continue to get cheaper.
That being said, if, because of some shortage of raw materials, or some other unforseen supply chain disruption, and the price of these devices does go up, the demand for them may drop at those higher prices, and some of the manufacturers may see hard times.  But that just means people with current/older mining equipment can continue to mine profitably as the difficulty remains suppressed or even drops.
It's all just a market, and the market will work itself out based on the incentives for the miners, the users, and the traders as long as bitcoin remains valuable and in demand.

Show me an electronics part/chip that has not declined in price over the long term?  The computer/chip market is one of the markets with the fastest falling prices of anything I can think of.  The costs will come down.
To answe the poster, if the price of bitcoin drops, and some miners no longer think it is worth running their mining equipment, then they will turn it off.  The difficulty will get easier, and that will incentivize more people to turn on their old hard ware (block erupters, etc.) as it drops back into their profitability range.  This system can and will work itself out, it's designed that way.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:59:34
You're assuming the banks care.  People will surely still try to do this with bitcoin (create fractionally-reserved 'banks'), but it will be fraud (as it is currently), and those institutions will collapse eventually.  Yes, people will lose their money when this happens, but the great thing about BTC is that we can chose to be our own bank, and we can stay skeptical of these institutions and take posession of our BTC in our own wallets to fight this.  It may be more convenient to go with a 'bank', but you run the risk that they may not be trustworthy, or 'fully backed'.  The markets will work this out because consumers have the choice to opt out of this.  In the current system its very hard to opt out, and the banks don't fail (b/c they get bailed out), so it keeps our confidence in them artificially high, and skepticism low.
