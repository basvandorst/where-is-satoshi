The same way you make sure you're not accepting cash previously used for criminal purposes. You don't. 
See the white-paper, more specifically the title "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". 
It should function as cash in that 1BTC = 1BTC always, without exception - we call this trait "fungibility", and it's hugely important to the success of any would-be 'electronic cash'. If we tolerate black-listing then confidence in the system will fall like a house of cards. Just like the fiat bills in your wallet, you should not have to worry about their history.

Probably few or none that are still supported, because address reuse is considered bad practice for privacy. Multibit classic is a single address wallet but it has been more or less deprecated. You -maybe- could use Electrum and manually set your change address to the same as the one you choose to spend from. 
What concerns me though is that your use of terminology is a little off and you mentioned a paper wallet. It's quite easy to lose funds with paper wallets if you don't have a firm understanding of what you're doing. You should always sweep the entire balance of funds from an address on a paper wallet, or you will lose coins. I urge you to do some reading and get familiar with at least these terms: address, inputs, outputs and wallet. And read a guide on how to sweep a paper wallet correctly. 
Having multiple addresses is not something that should be feared, as far as I'm aware you having nothing to gain by trying to reuse only one address. And the paper wallet thing sounds like an accident waiting to happen.

We're all experiencing this situation for the first time, truthfully there is no precedent from which to determine what's 'normal'. 
That said, I do have my own view. These levels of volatility are high imo. As Bitcoin has grown, the price has become more stable overall. Recent price movements are greater than 'usual', reflecting the uncertainty in the market. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:52:52

You've witnessed a rash of panic selling. If you think that an individual declaring bitcoin as failed makes it so, then you do not understand bitcoin. 
It seems that you've invested emotionally in bitcoin and hope for it to fail. By using the language which you've chosen to use (in this thread and others), you portray yourself as a spiteful and envious neckbeard who feels they've missed a great opportunity. 
How will you feel when the price climb to new highs? You have a choice, there's no need to be bitter.
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:04:03
How does Bitcoin compare with other markets? 
Many say TA is not so effective in the Bitcoin market.  I'm inclined to agree because its small market cap means the high concentration of news stories have a strong influence on the price. Plus the fact that many people holding Bitcoin are not sophisticated traders, and do not behave as such. Combined with the fact that Bitcoin's market is so young, means that it's altogether less predictable than other commodities. Or do you think its price movement is predictable?

I get you. This rate of rise is almost certainly unsustainable. If you're only in to make a quick profit, then consider yourself lucky and get out! 
Just bear in mind, longer investments tend to be more profitable - once you start trying to play the market, well, that's when most people lose money.
Are you likely to want to buy back in later if you sell now? Because that's playing with fire man, that's why people say buy and hold.

Right, it would bring BTC into the spotlight in a major way. I think this would send shockwaves through the BTC markets.
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:29:30
I'm of the opinion that the wave shown in the graph appears at different scales (fractally) in the BTC price history. 
But the wide most view (all time price history) is what's in question here right? I think that Bitcoin is such a unique and complex economic phenomenon that it will not necessarily adhere to this 'bubble' wave.
If forced to choose a point on the wave I would say, of course we're in the early days and would place us just at the beginning of the "media attention" phase.

All 5 major UK banks (RBS, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander, HSBC) have shown major hostility towards Bitcoin users. Many peoples' accounts have been closed without warning. 
I suggest checking out the UK subforum on LocalBitcoins as this is a common issue for UK based Bitcon users.

Even in the event of 'clamp downs' I can imagine certain governments using it as a political weapon against other states. So I think there will be a healthy and growing worldwide Bitcoin market. 
Besides that, history has shown that prohibition does absolutely not work, so it would make things interesting to say the least. But no, the cat is out of the bag and Bitcoin will cause disruption like we've never seen.

No. You just read some bad, confused journalism. That was referring to exchange volume. Chinese exchange volume is basically exaggerated and not comparable with US.

@_date: 2016-12-30 02:42:04
Yes. However there's no way to know where the next peak is until after it happens. The price could climb up continuously until 1800 and drop to 1200, we may never see 1000 usd again if we pass it. 
Your fear is built on the assumption that we're indeed close to the peak, but there's absolutely no empirical evidence of that being the case. (Not to be rude but this is a plain simple truth).
I have traded various assets, BTC is not like the others. This is the first time in history anything like this has happened. It is not directly comparable with anything else.

Interesting transaction, definitely some kind of experiment. This block explorer is the only one I could find which recognised the transaction:  
It remains unconfirmed, and I think that's because miners reject transactions with outputs below the dust limit. The sender of this transaction was trying to split the input to 749 outputs each of 1 satoshi, which is essentially disallowed by the Bitcoin network.
I know my analysis isn't entirely accurate but someone with in depth knowledge may be able to clarify those details.

You're welcome. Once you start gathering your data from primary sources you'll realize that most of these journalists' opinion pieces are worth exactly what you paid for them! Good luck.
P.s. If you were curious about my opinion, I say hold. There will be bubbles along the way but Bitcoin's 8 year history has shown that the "buy and hold" strategy is the simplest and most fruitful.

Avoid storing Bitcoin on exchanges; ensure that you control the private keys. 
Practice sending BTC between your own addresses to familiarise yourself so you can avoid accidental loss.

Nice idea. But how much adoption of this invention will happen given the fact that the homeless will not be able to spend the donations on drugs?
That's not a bash on the homeless by the way, I'm sympathetic and understand that very often the homeless do in fact have drug abuse issues.
Plus I find it kind of weird that you'd have to get so close to make a donation, it's like an intrusion of the homeless person's personal space.
Great concept, but you can see the problems right?

Governments' interventions can affect sentiment too. Many people would be discouraged if btc found itself on the wrong side of the law.

If you understand its unique properties, then you can understand its amazing potential. Then perhaps, you could look beyond its growing pains.
The criticisms you've described are similar to what people said about the Internet and the Web in the 80s/early 90s. Because it's not easy now, doesn't mean it won't become easier and more widely adopted. In fact, I'd argue that you would be a fool to bet against it.

The word you're looking for is arbitrage. 
1) Yes at some points 20% may have been correct.
2) No, they're not well serviced by overseas exchanges, who probably consider India to be higher risk. Polo doesn't do fiat to crypto, only crypto to crypto but they do have customers worldwide.
3) Yes, you could facilitate arbitrage opportunities with Indian citizens by acting as a bridge between the Western &amp; Indian exchanges. However, arbitrage requires big trades to make decent profits, and as you'd be dealing with individuals rather than exchanges directly, you would be taking on considerable risk.
Undoubtedly there are people exploiting these arbitrage opportunities but the obstacles and risks make it less appealing than it may first appear - if it was easy and safe the prices would already be close.
Hope that helps.

-I think- the price will continue to rise, but nobody knows for certain.
There's likely not a single cause behind the price movement, various factors are at play. However, I think the principle cause is simply that people were expecting a stronger downtrend, and the fact that didn't happen was encouraging to many.
@_date: 2016-09-03 01:21:56
Which wallet and how many confirmations? 
- some wallets may be delayed in syncing with the blockchain; can happen with web wallets, also light clients like electrum. It happens because the node they're syncing with is behind a few blocks. In these cases your transaction will appear eventually. 
How sure are you that you sent to an address belonging to that wallet? Compare the sending and receiving addresses carefully. 
- Wallets don't let you send to non-addresses so loss of funds due to typos aren't usually possible. There exists malware which will change a copied BTC address and replace with another, to result in you inadvertently diverting funds to an attacker.
