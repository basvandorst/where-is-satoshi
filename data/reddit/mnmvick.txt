That would be fantastic if they are doing that!  But hey, this is why you don't want to be using services that don't give you complete control over your bitcoin at all times.  Why people decide to centralize a decentralized currency is beyond me, but I suppose most people just don't think things through very well, do they?
But if companies are "creating" bitcoin through fractional reserves - at some point they will need to deliver - and that will only drive the price up DRAMATICALLY.  This isn't your grandfather's fiat currency . . . even the "pros" can learn something once in a while . .. . and they might very well learn that lesson.  I hope they do, anyway - will be a good lesson for the customers, too . . . 
Of course, they are probably NOT doing that in the first place.  Not smart to fractional reserve something that cannot be "created."
FUN ! ! !

Agreed - never had a problem either.  I've primarily used blockchain since I stumbled on it . . .

I agree that bitcoin is nearing a wave of new adoption - it is about one killer app away from being as mainstream as it gets!  The next year will be very interesting for bitcoin.
