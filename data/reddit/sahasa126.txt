Someone in there btc remittance dept is clueless and should be out of a job you get 15 minutes to complete the transaction and your funds leave instantly I even had a confirmation in the blockchain as well as one from their system . I suggest you call them and raise hell to expedite your credit so you don't miss more ship time. They wont fix it on their own the only reason the remittance btc address is even active is because of me chewing there ass a few weeks ago because the btc pay option 3 is not as they explain it is .

If the refund was immediate I would agree plus the fact they force you to stay their customer even if its one last time the refund is not immediate like my payment was its possible days and its not like it was days the order was in limbo and their system confirmed it was good as I watched the btc leave my wallet. I asked to just have the credit put to the card to finalize the order for the gpu nope that was supposedly not possible either how is that good for BTC.

That's what my order said when I chewed their butts a few weeks ago but my BTC never exited my wallet ,so i'd look there if I were you 1st that's how I knew that order was dead . The CS rep told me the same thing oh don't worry the order is fine , I would still be waiting for that item had I listened to her. They have no idea what they are doing when it comes to BTC follow the money if it did't leave your wallet that order is dead. and if it did and you don't get a confirmation good luck.

If they are giving me a credit how does it hurt them to just immediately post the credit and ship the product vs having me wait their time frame and possibly miss both the top 2 sales days of the year being black friday and cyber monday before I see the credit .

Pretty much did exactly that and was told that wasn't an option which is why I say they are holding me hostage to their terms and time frames.
Also why I stated they have taken the last order ever from me I see no reason why they couldn't credit the gpu immediately with the refund and continue on with the order .
