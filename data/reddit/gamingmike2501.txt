This is exactly my point of view. What is your opinion on people saying it's time wasting with my current financial situation ?
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:24:02
I love how responsive you guys have been thankyou 
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:50:04
Thankyou all for the advise. I'm having very mixed feed back,  some of you saying I'd be stupid not to invest, others saying I'd be stupid to do so.
For those of you saying I should invest even if it was a low amount, could any if you say you have done that yourself? And if so what did you see happen to your money over that time frame.
And people saying this low of an amount would be pointless, what is the minimum amount you've personally invested.
Also more info on the fee costs of transactions would be appreciated :)

Thankyou. Any success with buying other coins?

Right? I appreciate his advise but I do feel everyone starts somewhere and if the money I invest isn't going to go a miss per say then what do I have to lose ! 
Although I do already have responsibilities as I have a child of 6months (despite my young age) but this money is left over money that would usually go to waste non the less. And I'd gladly take a gamble with it on the hope of a better future

Haha thankyou

Yes I have a fair amount of financial support if it was needed, tho I've never felt the need to take.  
I'm not necessarily looking for a quick get rich scheme as I'm aware that is very unlikely unless I got extremely lucky. It would just be an unrealistic expectation. I'm more so looking at an affordable way into the trade that wouldn't negatively effect my financial situation, but simply give me another long term saving plan on the hope that my money I put in will grow over the years. I'm aware I could very well lose every penny. But that's a gamble I'm willing to take as it would be small amounts of disposable income, and certainly wouldn't be my only saving nor more than 20percent of my overall saved money so that if I was to lose what I put in it wouldn't impact my future greatly.
I'm not sure if my approach is in other opinions educated, I could very well look like an idiot. But that's why I'm here, to hear others take on my thoughts.
After all, this conclusion is only from my own research, Not experiance...

Would you recommend me saving money and then purchasing bitcoin when the price drops to avoid transaction fees ? If I was more confident in this I could probably afford to "invest"£60 a week. So should I just save this till I've got a couple hundred to spend ? It's that worry of am I willing to risk throwing away that 50 a week if it collapses. Hence why I thought putting in £30 as a start would be a good idea purely to see for myself just how volatile the market really is before putting any large amounts of money in.

Thanks mate very informative reply. And as for that last part I'd love to do that but I don't personally know anyone that has or continues to invest bitcoin :/ 
Also I wouldn't want to be spending an awful lot of time monitoring my profits and loss. So do you know any apps or websites that could give me live updates of my loss/profits via notification. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 10:13:08
Money that I arnt too uncomfortable loseing.

Thankyou this is so true ! Being a father at such a young age is a huge weight on my shoulders. I wouldn't go as far to say that I'm financially struggling because if that was the case I wouldn't be debating putting any of my money into this with risk of 100% loss. But one thing for sure is parenting is time consuming, it in a way doesn't give me the same advantage of a good financial start because I no long have the opportunity to continue my education full time still living with my parents without any responsibility. But this being said I don't see why I shouldn't be given an opportunity to invest in my future despite what little amount I have. Hence why I continue to invest what I can into my education.

Hi thanks for the fast feed back.  I don't actually mine bitcoin as I use nicehash which switches between alt coins to keep up with the most profitable then transfers it to bitcoin with that being the most popular
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:15:24
Thankyou this reply is incredibly helpful, could you point me in the right direction to a thread that discusses trading in general that could give me some feedback on getting started. Would you mind me inboxing you personally ? Go over my current situation, the risks I could afford to take. What I already know and advise on getting started in the market :) would be very appreciated. 
Late reply as I'm a little occupied at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:48:59
Correcting my grammar isn't really a productive response to my original question, but thankyou non the less haha.

Hello this was some very helping criticism and I appreciate you taking time to respond to my situation. 
I arnt currently behind on bills nor have I put myself in that position before. But I stated that I could put myself in debt if I was silly enough to put any non disposable funds into bitcoin.
As for my situation, I'm 20 years of age. Splitting my time between raising a 6 month old, trying to better my education and working stupid hours to make up for time I spend learning. My income is definatly not six figures God I wish it was. I manage to stay on top of bills, any funds left over tends to go into savings for my daughter's future. 
The only other saved funds I have is under 1k and counting haha. But this is hardly something to fall back on.... it's a start at least. 
I'm aware that nobody quite knows how the value of cryptocoins will change in the future, but I'm hoping that people could make an educated guess from their own experiance and give me a second opinion to compare with my own research. 
I'm aware my profits wouldn't be large at all, if any for that matter but I can't help but wonder how much id kick myself in the future if bitcoin was to sky rocket and  I didn't have any amount what So ever in bitcoin. So maybe having at least a couple hundred is a good start ? 
Thanks for your very educated reply you seem to talk from experiance and that is exactly what I need :)

When did you first invest that $20 ? I'm actually currently in a very similar position. Took an interest in bitcoin recently studied it's change in value and currently have £30  to start myself off. Just can't decide on coin. I'm pretty sure tho from what I've noticed is that all coins seem to go up and down in value whenever bitcoin does. Guessing that's due to its popularity and impact on the market. So with bitcoin having the highest value then I assume it will continue to be the most profitable in the long term
