Hope this helps. This video was inspired by a friend who is trading bitcoin without a ton of prior trading experience. Be congruent and Bitcoin on!

Thanks. Cowards sit behind the keyboard and incite violence. It's courageous to debate what you think and argue based on reason and logic(even though I think Andreas is wrong w Trump views). May the best arguments win! 
When you post tripe like satellite images of Trump Tower showing security vulnerabilities and the block me for asking why he did that, you are a coward. 
Normally, I would let it go. But it's embarrassing to me, as he's promoting bitcoin as well. 
We need sane people spreading the message to grow the community.

Think he just means the original pre fork Bitcoin, commonly referred to as "Bitcoin Core," which is actually what I am referring to as well in the plate. 
Some bastard already had "Bitcoin" lolz

If the founders of reddit become involved with a crypto exchange I will not use them either. Simple

The problem with Square is that Jack Dorsey (also twitter) runs the company. Jack Dorsey's own philosophy is that he believes in censorship. I cant think of someone who is more opposite Satoshi Nakamoto than Jack Dorsey. Use another app/exchange
