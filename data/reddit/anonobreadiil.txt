Do you suggest LN, voting pools and sidechains will be regulated?


[Stash]( voting pools will be unregulated. Anyone with enough savings in BTC will be easily able to afford $20 to withdraw it from the voting pool or Coinbase.
Sorry, I'm just not seeing any problem here.


OT is NOT a permissioned ledger.


*You're No True Scotsman* unless you have your own private key.
Trivia question: would you rather me pay you 1 BTC on Coinbase, or the equivalent in fiat to a bank account? Going by your logic, you wouldn't *ever* accept money on Coinbase, because BTC without the private key attached is *totally worthless*! It's utterly nonsensical to refuse BTC payment over Coinbase, and voting pools are a **clear upgrade** to today's Bitcoin banks.


Pfft - that isn't even the first of many problems preventing 70% of the world population using Bitcoin. First and foremost, **they don't have any savings to invest**. Eureka!


People have done *far* clumsier things than pay a 7% fee on a transaction. Oh no, "heaven forbid".

What are your complaints with the current process?
Do you want a better diversity of experts? If so, do you have any suggestions for finding them other than on the multitude of discussion forums as laid out by the current market?
Do you want a better diversity of full nodes? Sorry, but Bitcoin full nodes need core consensus rules to live by, and if you make a "Bitcoin" full node with a different set of rules to live by than the rest of the network you risk *decoupling from the rest of the network*.
@_date: 2015-11-16 06:39:37
Unfortunately you can't just toss out five different full nodes with each one accepting a different maximum block size, because the nodes will fall out of sync. Then there will be no singular source of truth in Bitcoin, completely defeating the purpose.

Are you suggesting you wouldn't accept being paid BTC to an account on Gemini, Coinbase or ItBit? Isn't receiving BTC on an exchange of practical use to ordinary people?
Centralized settlement of BTC is 99.999999% as good as decentralized settlement, **so long as you can get the money out of there**. If I can withdraw the money, leave some of it on a marketplace voting pool or LN for a few months, that's more than enough to cover me. If you're making a major purchase, a $20 transaction fee to send it without LN or voting pools or a bank isn't world ending. The point of Bitcoin is not to pay people with it, it's digital gold first and foremost - and most gold isn't used for direct payment.
Bitcoin as money should exist outside the purview of societal institutions which are corruptible, inherently through their bureaucracies and the importance placed on self-preservation above all. Having Corporations run all the Bitcoin nodes *really does sacrifice this*.


Genuinely, mining is owned by Corporations. If Corporations run all the nodes too, **how does Bitcoin differ from a permissioned ledger**?

That's as absurd as saying "but who's going to buy NYC real estate" when it costs more than the slums.
Seriously, if you're getting all there is to get out of PayPal, then dump all your BTC and use PayPal. Why are you even *here*?
BTW I'm willing to buy 100% of your BTC for a deep discount when the average fee rises to PayPal parity. By your logic, you'd be stupid not to take me up on such an offer since after all Bitcoin will be "worthless" if God forbid it ever happens to cost more than $1.00 to send. Lest we forget sidechains, LN and voting pools can all settle in BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:08:03
Sure - let's just *nope* over the fact Bitcoin is impervious to civil asset forfeiture, disinflationary next to inflationary fiat currencies and useable over the internet without identifying yourself.
No no no - none of that even MATTERS! lol - "it's about the low fees". That's right, you adopted Bitcoin for the low fees. Don't worry, "I believe you" buddy.

Your side's proposal to double the block size comes with a great bravado towards risking the individual's ability to run a node at home. "It will be fine", they say. Except here's what Gavin said about this in 2011:


Betting Bitcoin's future on Moore's Law is an unsettling proposition. Greg Maxwell has taken the polar opposite stance from Gavin's here for the entirety of his Bitcoin core dev tenure. He stated re: the block size debate, to the effect of "when it comes, it will have sweeping political ramifications" comparing it to a rabbit hole. You can disagree with the decentralist vision of Bitcoin, but you have to admit his views are **consistent**. This is coming from one of Bitcoin's top core contributors.
Gavin Andresen [strictly agreed]( with Patrick Strateman's points at Scaling Bitcoin, here's him acknowledging new full nodes will become impossible to setup if demand for blockspace outpaces technological progress:




Gavin agrees - we *do* lose something if demand outstrips technological progress.
Prove doubling block size limits up to 8GB is even *fathomable* on a home desktop PC with an ordinary connection. You don't even care about the full node user, but let's pretend for a second full nodes are superior to SPV in every way, it's akin to a luxury item and is desireable for security and privacy - to you that all seems to belong on a server rack, but to me that's the best wallet around.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:35:49


Great. And with conservative block size limits after ten years, it could take 5 minutes or less to sync the entire blockchain. Full nodes will undoubtedly replace SPV then due to the massive privacy and security benefits had for almost no cost.
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:41:57


As you know, this "pay the full nodes" adage is a Sybil vulnerable non-solution. The idea is dead, and I would strongly suggest not holding out hope.


You're on the right track now. You just have to come to terms with the fact that nodes can't be incentivized. And *because* they can't be *paid*, nodes are absolutely eligible for policy level protections. It's like pollution protections, or litterring laws. If we clog up the blockchain even with perfectly legitimate transactions, at a certain point, the park gets trashed and nobody will want to use it. The direct parallel is we can go with gigablocks today and insodoing we make Bitcoin into a permissioned ledger nobody is interested in.


Why would transaction fees increase if more people didn't want to use the blockchain?

A voting pool consists of MULTIPLE hubs, each hub being an M of N oracle.
The industry is poised to adopt best practices for individual cosigners at the hub level. Notaries will prove their independence, and the market can easily rate the credibility of each hub, leading to competition amongst voting pools for trustworthiness.
In addition, voting pool hubs can rotate out their M of N cosigners as a matter of cryptographic policy.


You'll need to do elementary due diligence on the pools, and avoid massive industry-wide conspiracies to defraud users of their money. That's a major step up from the banking model where you simply turn over all of your money to the third party.
Finally, you'll note you don't need 100% perfect security for daily payments, and in fact the market may very well prefer lower fees, better anonymity and faster confirmations on these low value payments.

In the video, the process by which you identify miners comes down to electing Andreas Antonopolis to sign blocks with "Proof of Reputation". It didn't seem like you proposed identifying current miners. Rather that you proposed an election process for a Bitcoin mining "House of Representatives".
But if a very large miner or the Chinese government 51% attacks Bitcoin, how is it of any help?
@_date: 2015-11-16 07:42:36
Really, you or Gavin should do a real performance benchmark using 8GB blocks.
At those speeds, I suspect a well-connected full node will saturate the connection. There's already a 1MB block that takes 30 seconds to process on a modern quad core processor - let's see how long it takes you to sync a blockchain sized 2,920 GB which is how big it will be after only 365 hours of usage at those levels.
Without question, technology will improve, but if you're looking to get the most value out of Bitcoin it needs to be decentralized. Full nodes are *bothersome* to run on a desktop PC today, and there's no denying that bigger blocks will make it even *harder*. This is just the wrong direction for Bitcoin.
Satoshi launched Bitcoin as a desktop application for Windows. He did this purposefully, because there was no better way to entice ordinary people to run full nodes. It was true then, and **it's true now**.

Silk Road was centralized, and you'd agree most of the people using Silk Road at the time believed they were engaging in censorship-resistant commerce?
Look into voting pools, because they're going to make Bitcoin services like Silk Road possible again without trusting any of the money to the operator.

In your words, OT is a permissioned ledger system. I must offer some correction.
OT server operators don't have control over your money. They don't issue you any private keys. You generate your own private keys on the client, just like you do with Bitcoin today.
OT servers are never in a position to steal your money directly, but can do so as a cartel. But it's still better than Coinbase since you don't need to register under your own name or reveal your IP, indeed there is ZERO registration.

Care to point out a Bitcoin 2.0 project with more than 10 users? They don't exist, really. Bitcoin 2.0 is a JOKE. Bottom line you're here to pump your altcoin, and you're good at it.


But you own ETH. Couldn't this be coloring your perspective. Have you heard of sidechains or voting pools?


Rule number one of pumping altcoins: conflate your altcoin pump with the fall of fiat.


How poetic.
@_date: 2015-11-16 19:43:03


1. Because Bitcoin has a fixed supply whereas fiat currency is inflationary
2. Because you'd prefer buying products online without giving ID
3. Because you want your nest egg to be immune to civil asset forfeiture
SEPA and VISA are **payment systems** whereas the Bitcoin blockchain is a general purpose distributed ledger.
To make an apples to apples comparison, you must compare SEPA and VISA to LN, voting pools and sidechains - all of which will provide nearly zero cost and instant BTC payments.

If you had your way you would eliminate the block size limit in a heartbeat. If you're able to shove gigablocks down the throats of the dev team despite extreme protestation and technical objections, once 8GB comes in you'll just double it again or remove it. All the home PC nodes will be gone by that point anyway, leaving them to be run by Corporations in datacenters controlled by other Corporations.


On the contrary, the market seems to value the deeply ingrained thinking of one of the key proponents of BitcoinXT.


I know fully well what he argued. You and Gavin see no problem at all with turning over real full nodes to Corporations and institutions, and you justify it by saying "oh, we don't need historical block data, Corporations will handle that". And yet that action kneecaps the individual who will never ever be able to run a full node.


Bottom line: you can't prove ordinary people will be able to run a full node at home with 8GB blocks.

I see no refutation of anything by Gavin at your "source" - which was the text of BIP101.

That's as absurd as saying Porsche won't discount their cars because it would force a race to the bottom. Even if Porsche discounts their cars, the race to the bottom won't happen and the industry won't be destroyed.


Let me make sure I have this correct. When Mike Hearn claims he will be Bitcoin's benevolent dictator to force through your preferred policy action - that's not "top-down policy action". No, but when the leading technical experts in Bitcoin - including the majority of those who BUILT the system you're now criticising - disagree with YOUR preferred policy action - *that's* "top down".
Just wow.
Without littering laws, public spaces will get trashed until a tipping point is reached whereafter the space is so dilapidated that nobody wants to use it.
In Bitcoin terms, if all of China adopts Bitcoin tomorrow, we can't afford to dive haphazardly into gigablocks just because you think Bitcoin will "implode" with high fees if we don't. Because if Google and Apple run 100% of the Bitcoin full nodes while BitFury and Intel do 100% of the Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin is de facto a permissioned ledger regardless of how many Chinese Doritos are fitting on the chain.

We can achieve global scale with 100MB blocks or less, and ordinary people can run Bitcoin full node wallets on desktop PCs if LN and voting pools become the predominant BTC payments paradigm.
If I send you BTC on Coinbase, you're accepting that as payment 99.99999% of the time despite the fact that it's "centralized". All you care about most of the time is if you can withdraw that BTC to cold storage, or spend it later on without getting hassled.
Importantly, voting pools, LN and sidechains are going to be exactly like sending BTC over Coinbase except you won't have to trust a third party with your money or ever identify yourself.

Stop conflating the advent of the core ruleset of Bitcoin, with Bitcoin full node development. Full node development is welcomed with open arms, but what isn't recommended is reimplementing the core ruleset or changing it however slightly. Refusing to heed these warnings will risk decoupling your node from the rest of the network under unforeseeable or unknowable conditions.


It's unfortunate some of the terms being tossed around by Theymos, but let's not forget it was Mike Hearn and Gavin who launched the PR blitz leading predictably to major blowback.


It can handle this just fine at 1MB blocks. But what if blocks were so large that almost NOBODY was running full nodes aside from Corporations?  Imagine not being able to vote with your feet because the policies of Mike Hearn make running a node impossible to do outside of high performance clusters in remote datacenters. Do you think vying for attention on Reddit would be very effective? Would you rather be organizing a local lobbying group to speak with your Corporate ISP's Bitcoin node operator about upgrades you think are NEEDED?
Wasn't it just proven by Princeton researchers that in the US Corporatocracy, public opinion is the POLAR OPPOSITE of public policy? Why would you want to try the same old political tricks with Bitcoin Core?


Free, plus the cost of syncing the full blockchain if you intend to smoothly transition the entire Bitcoin network onto your software. Sure, but could you afford making that sync *anonymously* if it takes 9 weeks to sync Hearn's bloated blockchain on high powered servers in a remote datacenter? What if gigablocks took away your voice permanently? Better hope you like the taste of an infinity blockchain.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:51:59


Wow, what a way to unfairly paint the opposition. And I have a beef with anyone who wants Corporations to run all the nodes in datacenters. Neither one of us wants either of these things to happen, but alas tradeoffs are necessary.


Solve anything? **Solve** anything?!
Do you know what the difference is between BitTorrent and a Hadoop cluster?
With BitTorrent, you can be an **ordinary Windows user**, and you can STILL share any file straight off your computer with the rest of the world and there's realistically not a THING anyone can do about that.
It's PEER TO PEER. Get it?
Importantly, you can do the SAME today with a Bitcoin full node wallet.
Conversely, ordinary Windows users will never ever run a Hadoop cluster on their home PC.
Do you see the difference?
With a Hadoop cluster, you need a sophisticated deployment strategy, high end hardware and a specific skillset.
With BitTorrent, YOU CLICK A BUTTON.
Sir, I submit to you that if I need to provision a remote server to write Bitcoin software that is EQUALLY as lame as my needing a remote server to provision Hadoop.
Hadoop is NOT peer to peer. It's just not. It's not the same thing as BitTorrent.
Let's keep Bitcoin free from Corporate datacenters so that it can stay peer to peer. I should not NEED a remote service of ANY KIND to act as a full node. If that becomes necessary, you can wax poetic all you want about how "more adoption equals more nodes" - if those nodes are in datacenters, Bitcoin as we know it is *dead*.
@_date: 2015-11-15 05:32:41


Permissioned ledgers have "enough throughput" to scale to mass adoption levels. Bitcoin is more than just *throughput*. High throughput centralized payment rails are a dime a dozen.


You don't have to rely on LN, voting pools or sidechains. Just be prepared to pay $20 for a full blockchain write should you need to make one, and rebalance your daily spending accounts across popular voting pools and LN wallets to save on fees.

Gee, thanks Captain Obvious. And pray tell, what happens to all the other full nodes that fall out of sync with what is the "longest chain" according to the rest of the nodes?

Drones and [Big Dog]( are replacing piloted aircraft and boots on the ground.
Because when a robot can do 80% or more of what a human would do at 10% of the price, the market is going to take the path of least resistance.
Similar to remote controlling pilotless stealth fighter jets, [Stash]( will allow you to "remote control" Bitcoin held in multisig voting pools. This isn't a "perfect" substitute for a full blockchain write, but you get the ability to:
1. Send truly untraceable cash, not recorded on ANY blockchain, without even being at a computer for maximum privacy and plausible deniability protections
2. Make truly instant payments for little to no fee, because unlike full blockchain writes you don't need to wait for a block or pay any miners
While it's true you do need full blockchain writes to move money in and out of cold storage, if you're just replenishing the balance on your LN wallet or voting pool account and that's the common paradigm I genuinely believe it makes Bitcoin stronger for its decentralizing full node resource minimization, and it does everything you want money to do for you, without sacrificing censorship resistance.

Blockchain activity routinely explodes when the BTC price is going nuts. People are rushing to the exchanges to take advantage of the volatility. They're not out rushing to make a remittance payment. They're not out rushing to some fintech company's private ledger.
If you want to speculate, you have to balance leaving 10% of your nestegg on a trustworthy exchange, with the cost of having to fight the crowd who also wants to sell at the top of a rally.
