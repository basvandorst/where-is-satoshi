I have day traded some and made a little bit of money (nothing crazy), but man I just couldnt, I dont have the funds available to make it worth full time, and I would be playing around with my entire funds available.  I couldnt put that at risk to be day trading without having a backup.
I wish I could be you, I think that would be so exciting everyday, I just couldnt.

Hiro runs off X11 like DRK, but does it even better.  It launched Saturday.

When I first got into BTC I was into using sites to acquire BTC for work on the internet. [GiftHulk]( was a pretty good one, [EarnCrypto](  among others Im forgetting.  Its how I earned my first Parts of BTC.  Among these sites (and the old days of the freeroll poker tournaments on SealsWithClubs.eu) I made over .3 BTC in a few months.  I know thats not a ton in total, but its how I first got involved.  I say give that a shot as well.
Dont mess with faucets, those are not worth your time.

Dude, those are good schools.  Not the top tier schools (they are not Ivy Leagues), but both are incredibly good schools for law, you dont know your law schools.

This sounds like a great thing for LongBets.org 
Seriously, some of the bets on that website are fantastic like [This]( [This]( or my personal favorite one [This](
I say make the long bet! It all goes to charity.
