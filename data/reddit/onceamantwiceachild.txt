I sent another email explaining the I need more specific instructions as to how to do this since my account isn't reflecting a balance at all. this is rubbish. thanks for your help anyway guys

My issue is that coinbase isn't reflecting any of my funds whether pending, in my wallet, or on GDAX. It just shows a button telling me "Close my account". Here's a [screenshot] ( I suddenly no longer have access to my money or bitcoin with no indication that I can retrieve them. This is really gut-wrenching. I had sent that $1000 with the hopes of buying some more bitcoins after it was processed today and the 8.98BTC isn't chump change either...

i honest have no idea. the thing is, when i log into my account it doesn't show any indication of the pending $1000 transfer or the bitcoin in GDAX as though it was already transferred... theres just a button saying ["Close my account"]( which i can only assume will open a whole 'nother can of worms if i click...

Looks like the deposit only now is starting to reflect. Here's a [screenshot]( with time stamp. It makes me wonder what would have happened if I did hit that " Close my account" button...  
Still no indication of how to retrieve bitcoin on GDAX. I'm only redirected too the close my account screen. Here's another [screenshot]( of that to show the $1000 reflected. Still no idea why my account is being closed. Seriously loosing sleep over this but I hope some documentation of this process will provide better assistance to people this might happen to in the future as I still have not received any real help concerning my Coinbase/GDAX account.

thanks for reaching out. i have been able to withdraw my funds and bitcoin. I still wish i could use coinbase/gdax but I guess I'll just have to find another wallet/exchange.

Here's another [screenshot]( of a couple of my emails. I'm definitely real. Definitely upset. I just want to understand what could have happened compromise my account and if this cant be undone, how will Coinbase get my money back to me?

@_date: 2017-03-10 13:56:20
that i understand but its almost as though the purpose was to hit BIG a sell order @ 1350...
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:55:00
i have the feeling in about to happen again...
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:42:18
