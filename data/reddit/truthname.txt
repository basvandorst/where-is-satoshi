Bro we are talking about removing the paper currency from the world Which is not backed by anything. We are going to change how the goods are going to be bought and sold. There will be no more money laundering or scams(business loans) etc. We are going to create an ecosystem where the power will be in the hands of you and me and not govt or banks.   And then the use cases of blockchain is beyond finance.Its potential is a hell lot more. Think of internet in the early stages. We are not yet in the early stages of blockchain. You better try to learn and do some homework.

Anybody can guarantee anything man! When someone said that the earth is not flat ,were they delusional? Do you think humans are going to stop innovation?They are not going to adopt newer tech? If not then you are delusional! We are in this world only to explore, grow and innovate! If Edison never tried 10000 times then there wouldn't have been a electric bulb. Do you think he was delusional to believe in electrical bulb. Bro look at the big picture and dream the big.
