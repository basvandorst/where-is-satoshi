But you can't run a business like that is the problem. Maybe not knowing whether you are getting your pizza for $8 or $12 is ok for a single customer. But if you are a business selling 100s of pizzas a day a 20% difference on your bottom line simply for accepting bitcoin instead of a credit card is a ton of risk.

Right? Even something as simple as buying pizza is shut down when you don't know how much your currency is going to be worth in the next 30 minutes.

Most businesses pay bills month to month. Electricity, water, gas, perishable inventory. Ultimately you want a currency to be a stable store of value, not an investment to harvest capital gains on at the end of the year. If bitcoin is to become prominent you wouldn't want its daily exchange rate standard deviation to be much larger than a few tenths if a percent.

End central banking? Governments will not give up monetary controls, it's one of the few ways to directly influence the economy. Bitcoin would sooner be banned. 
If you're argument is the world shifts to a decentralized currency thus eliminating the power of central banks, that still is a huge assumption that has big issues. First, governments could still simply ban it. People are not going to buy groceries on a black market just to use a decentralized currency. Second, governments don't need to ban it mainly because bitcoin is bad at being a currency. Transactions take far too long to post and that's not even the largest problem. The big problem is the volatility. You can't run a low margin business and expose yourself the a plus or minus 2% value daily. Currencies work because tomorrow people are pretty sure a dollar will still be worth a dollar. The range of values a bitcoin can be tomorrow is way too large to be a stable store of value viable for daily business transactions.
