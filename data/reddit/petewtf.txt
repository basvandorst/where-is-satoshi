If Oanda DID allow trading we would firstly have an exchange that would be able to handle volumes (I've used their forex platform and its very robust)
Secondly the mainstream speculators would move in and fuel a massive bubble. 
Thirdly using their leverage we would have a tool to hedge bitcoin transactions at a low price and with minimal capital

Seems like an interesting idea, think that unfinished should be allowed though, we are still stuck in a traditional view of books despite the advance of e readers ect.
We tend to think that a book must be a feature length film, however the internet allows us to serialise and create literature which is more like a TV series (of course the benefit of this too is that the story can evolve with the audience reaction too)
Just my 2mBTC...
