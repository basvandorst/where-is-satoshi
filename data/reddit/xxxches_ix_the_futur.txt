I'm pretty sure the false narratives are yours. Or why did adoption reverse (steam, microsoft, etc. stopping to accept bitcoin because of high fees)?
And again what about the public ledger that was supposed to stop corruption in governments and bring justice to the world?

Hey, I have two questions about LN. I tried to google it, but didnt find an answer. I've read a few times that if I want to receive a payment over LN, I'd need to have at least that amount already on the LN. Thats not true, is it? If that was true, most people could never use Bitcoin/LN as their main money, because most live paycheck to paycheck.
And the 2nd question. How to get Billions of people to use Bitcoin/LN, when only 7 TX/s are possible on-chain? It would take over 30 years for every person to do just one single on-chain transaction.
Edit: Sry it doesnt seem to be only 7 TX/s. Dont know why i had that number in mind. Whats the maximum? Seems to be just a few more, so the question stays pretty much the same.

doubt it

I did not confuse present with future, I was rather asking why the LN is still a nightmare when it was supposed to be ready such a long time ago. Maybe you are right, but I have the impression that Bitcoin was indeed crippled and billions of people will never use something like the LN for all their payments. Im just trying to find out what to believe. So thank you very much, if you are genuinely trying to help and not being paid to write this.
I have to more questions for you or anyone. I tried to google it, but didnt find an answer.

Ok, thank you very much!
To the last sentence: so it made it in there as a temporary thing, but later was not removed/significantly increased (as intended by satoshi), because not everyone wanted it to be removed/significantly increased anymore? Thats a very special case then, isnt it? Because in that case consensus kind of works the other way around?

What do you mean risk of loss? Isn't it supposed to be as safe as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:34:10
The base layer obviously works fine now because people had to stop using it when fees went up to $60...The point is it was working fine overall until some corporation got involved, bought developers, and the blocksize limit was kept... BLOCKing the STREAM of transactions.
And what about the public ledger that was supposed to stop corruption in governments and bring justice to the world?
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:58:03
But now there is Bitcoin and forks (which are not the official Bitcoin). And I thought there was some sort of rule that changes to Bitcoin require consensus (social?) in a way that pretty much everyone in the community has to be in favour of it. Is that not true? If it is, can you give another answer, referring to this (social consensus)?
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:59:07
No, now you are trolling? The blocksize limit was supposed to be a temporary security measurement, according to satoshi. It was to be significantly increased/removed in the future. Thats why i called it a special case. Its unlike some other change regarding consensus. Like i described...
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:13:30
You dont know what I mean? First it gets consensus to be temporarily implemented. (If bad actors want to get something in, they cant, because not everyone wants it in.) But then it doesn't need consensus to go from temporarily to permanently, but it needs consensus to go from "it is there" back to "it is not there" [what was supposed to happen at some point when it was firstly implemented with consensus]. (Now bad actors could keep it in against what everyone originally wanted, by only being a part of the community).
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:40:52
It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:27:39
No idea what you mean?
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:14:29
By everyone? He probably assumed there will be consensus.
Maybe he unknowingly created an attacking point? Or there was no way around it?
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:07:44
Thx for your answer, but I think there was a misunderstanding. I explained again what I wanted to know in a reply to TheGreatMuffin.
Edit: sry I couldnt find an answer, i didnt read the whole sub of the last 2 years though :D you can just link an answer too ofc.
@_date: 2019-05-29 09:16:00
What did you mean by "never merged any code"? Just saying thats what he wrote. Code to increase the limit.
How can you say Satoshis points are no longer relevant, when something different (2nd layer scaling) isnt even properly working yet (after years)? LOL.
I dont want to keep this conversation going. Just answer these 2 questions, please.
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:17:17
What do you mean nobody runs them? There are forks with big blocks running. What math? So sathoshi couldnt do math? If its safe to say that 2nd layer scaling is the future, why isnt it already the present after so many years (its there but not widely used/properly working)? Dark lonely and desperate corner? It has about 1/4 as many users as this sub. What didnt work out with big blocks (not necessarily referring to the coin of that sub)?
Move on from what to what? How are both things working out right now, in your opinion?
@_date: 2019-05-29 08:06:01
Haha, I think everyone got a bit confused. Let me explain it again. The plan (from the beginning - by satoshi) was to not keep it\* (it was meant as a temporary anti-spam measurement). A big part of the community did not want to keep it. But it was kept (against the original plan - therefore a change to bitcoin) without consensus. Why/how was it possible in that case, if every change needs consensus. Thats all I wanted to know.
And to what you said in brackets: there was no consensus to do so - but removing it at some point was the original plan by satoshi. So if there is no consensus - the original plan should have been kept? Or am I missing something?
To your last question: what I'm saying is there was no consensus.
\*or significantly increase it (so everyone can use bitcoin easily on-chain except for cent or maybe dollar transactions). Not sure right now if he wanted to increase it to that point or remove it completely.
