Well, that's what I'm doing here. I don't have any stock in bitcoins. You gotta start somewhere...

Interesting how you can do the local exchange. Are these just individuals that are willing to trade bitcoins for currency in person (or non-electronically)?
Also, am I correct that a paper wallet would be something that's printed off at home and then put into a safe deposit box or vault of some sort?

Okay thanks. So is this correct: Traditionally, I would go buy something and authorize them to take funds from my account (via debit, or credit, or handing them cash). With bitcoin, I would have a wallet with each vendor and I would transfer however much I need from one of my personal wallets (similar to a bank account) to the wallet I hold with the vendor, who would then be authorized to pull the bitcoins from that wallet only?

So is setting it up on your own through this bitcoin-qt considered best practice or are the sites considered "safe" or do they provide some sort of guarantee?
And am I understanding correctly that I have to have some sort of online wallet to transfer real currency into and then I have to transfer the crypto currency to myself, or is there a way to cut out the middleman?

Okay cool. So basically funds are "pushed" (from sender to receiver of funds) with the bitcoin method, while they're "pulled" (receiver of funds tells sender's bank to send it $x) with things like credit cards?
and thanks for being so welcoming. I'm sure I'll have more questions as parts of the process get laid out.

Thanks for the response. With keeping the wallet locally (and a backup), how is it determined which bitcoins are mine and which aren't? I take it there's some sort of central authority that keeps track of which bitcoins are in which wallet?
