I'm 15, lost a few cents and no job, still rocking hard at $2.13 get on my level scrubs
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:33:53
I was wondering how I went from 29¢ to 34¢!
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:46:27

@_date: 2013-08-05 00:55:24
Couldn't you just use a simple proxy for that? I.E. Hotspot Shield?

Thanks a lot man, next time BTC comes up in a conversation i'll definitely send them some if they're not just dismissing it as some crazy fake currency
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:50:41
this is actually the greatest advertisement ever
@_date: 2013-06-15 19:04:14

Well that sucks dick, is there any reason an average person such as myself would ever need to use TOR? Or is it mostly used for illegal activity (silk road)?

"$1,000,000" yeah ok pal lol, how much would 0.00001 BTC be worth? like 100 dollars or some shit?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:30:46
how much would 0.0089 BTC be worth? (ignore my math retardation, im smarterererer in real life i swurrr)
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:31:10
Haha that's actually awesome, my friends personally think I'm crazy when i talk about it.
My favorite part is that even the chef got in on it, that was just the icing on the cake.
Great story, keep spreading the word of BTC.
P.S. Also the Johnny Appleseed of BTC? Christ, i'm so protective about the small amount of BTC that i have, maybe giving a little bit away will get people more interested. Thanks for the idea :)

Oh shit a snip-

As someone who is not well informed on TOR, was freedomhost just hosting websites on TOR that happened to be distributing CP, among other things, therefore the owner of freedomhost is being charged with the distribution?

Totally worth it  also I love how simple it is! (I think I have a gambling problem also.)

"Don't tell us what to do"
@_date: 2013-08-04 23:58:19
I guess that makes sense, my $0 in bitcoins probably couldn't afford anything anyways.

OP didn't answer our questions before we asked them, what a shitty time traveler.
