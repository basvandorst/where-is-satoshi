If I have the ability to do something, I have a right to do it as long as I'm not infringing on the rights of others. 
No one's rights are being infringed by negating claimed powers of the State.

The State is claiming "might makes right". Why can't we?
We all have a right to circumvent tax laws. For egregious laws, it's a duty to circumvent them. Governments claim powers to punish people for exercising those rights and duties.

I'm not infringing on your rights so you have no fear from me. Historically, police powers are more dangerous to society than society is to itself. The SS, the KGB, Savak and various American policing agencies are prime examples.
I trust society more than I trust government/police. YMMV.

The military-industrial complex is government writ large. The growth of prisons, the drug war and policing is a symptom of cancerous government growth.
The size and exponential growth of the national debt and the Federal budget is also symptomatic of the tumor that is government on the buttcheeks of society.

Government has been growing in my country for over a century. Society has been getter sicker.
Society precedes government. To see government as more important than society is part of the sickness.

That data is only useful if transactions can be tied to personal info from exchanges. Many transactions involve coins with no personal info tied to them or the trail stops cold at the last person foolish enough to allow their personal info to be tied to public keys.

I'm not infringing on anyone's rights. The State infringes on our rights as a matter of course.

$32 to near zero was a drop. This is a blip.

By reducing government. Society and government are antithetical to each other.

The right to circumvent it is built into the blockchain. We don't need to use exchanges to use Bitcoin.

Eisenhower wanted to call it the "military-industrial-congressional complex" but it was nixed. He was saying that two-thirds of the problem were the military and Congress, both functions of government.


So says government.

If society is healthy, police and military aren't needed as much as in an unhealthy society.  Too much government makes society unhealthy, such as we have today.
Police and military are the government.
