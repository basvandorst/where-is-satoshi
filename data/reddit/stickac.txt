Multibit HD uses just the first account of the BIP44 hierarchy, so you might have your coins on second or further acount.

Coin control is not user friendly at all. BIP44 Accounts are much more friendly way how to achieve almost the same.
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:32:31
Common, there are BIP39 and BIP44 standards for more than 2 years already and these are still not implemented. Let's just agree that Core is not very fast on implementing new stuff. Which I think is a good thing, but your original argument about not having a standard is just dull.

Coin control is feature that is considered an expert feature and is hardly really needed for common people.
You can create more accounts, where you can be sure that coins from account A never mix with coins from account B.
If this is for some reason not enough, you are encouraged to use a TREZOR enabled software wallet with coin control such as Electrum.

OpenBazaar is dead on arrival. I don't know even where to start. In short: it does not solve the main issues of decentralized marketplace at all or it solves them very poorly (trust, anonymity/pseudonymity, messaging, persistence, discoverability, user friendliness etc.). Also there is a very strong not-invented-here syndrome present. I am not saying these can't be fixed, but frankly, I think it would be easier for another team to just start from scratch.

Currently it links Bitcoin Core and NodeJS together to create a monolith that is able to run code written Javascript. That is quite interesting hack to achieve high performance.
In the future more clean solution will be used when Bitcoin Core will communicate with Bitcore using ZeroMQ.

Yes, you can. You'd need twice as much HDD storage when compared to running just Bitcoin Core, though.

Actually, we don't need to opensource mytrezor to allow people to run it on their nodes. We can ship minified code, we can use shared source license, etc. Obviously, best would be to fully open it, but this is being discussed internally right now as we learnt from the past. We agree on the goal, we just need to figure out how to get there.

This attack is much harder (if not impossible) to perform on TREZOR, because our packaging is impossible to be opened without destroying it. The box is also equiped by two holograms, which also help in this case.
Of course, these measures would not help if people don't know how the official TREZOR packaging should look like, so please check this documentation and also share it with others:

Short version: 
Uploading an unofficial firmware will remove the metadata area where private data is stored.
Long version:
Before the firmware update, the metadata area is copied to RAM and erased from the flash. Just after the last block of firmware is written, the bootloader checks the firmware signature and if and only if it is correct, it puts the metadata back on flash. There is no point in time where evil code and user metadata live on the flash together. This is done to mitigate the attack where you create an evil firmware, pad it with lots of zeroes, start uploading it, but unplug the device just before it has the chance to finish writing all blocks and check their signature. That would lead to situation where you have functional evil firmware and older metadata from good firmware, like you describe.

Most of those apps you listed using coinmap API to retrieve the venues data anyway. Coinmap now has its own database.

The reason is much more prosaic. Bootloader used to live in a separate repository. Once we decided to open the bootloader, I copied the bootloader related files to the trezor-mcu repository and removed the old repo. The only changes between 1.2.0 and 1.2.5 were some wording changes and that we added a feature in 1.2.5 that prints the hash of the firmware that has just been uploaded so one can check it against what was advertised in the upload dialog. Jochen Hoenicke was even able to reverse engineer the changes and published them here:

Chrome extension is a "market enabler", while Firefox extension is not.
Chrome extension allows people to use TREZOR without any binary components (such as plugin or bridge), because it can access USB devices directly from Javascript. Another reason is that this is the only way how to use TREZOR on Chromebook, which is gaining popularity in certain demographics.
Both of these issues are not solved by creating a Firefox extensions and it would not bring anything extra when compared to using plain myTREZOR.com in Firefox.

Mnemonics are case sensitive, because hashing is involved. However, myTREZOR does not let you to enter anything else to TREZOR besides valid lowercase wordlists words.
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:30:15
It's basically a wiki. If you see such stuff, don't hesitate to correct or remove it.
@_date: 2014-10-09 06:34:45
No. Electrum did not want to use BIP39 mnemonics.
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:08:49
There is still a lot of research and development being done around TREZOR. New features are coming such as multisig, encryption, password management, etc. For me it's more important to have strong R&amp;D process and the great support team rather then flooding the market with cheap devices with no prospect of evolution and no support.

It is just to be sure in case of bug or blackout that would lead to wiping the device.

We always put "positive" actions (next, confirm, ok) on the right and "negative" on the left (previous, abort, cancel) button.
It makes sense when you realize that in order to confirm transaction you have to press "next" several times (for each output) and then "confirm". I guess you agree that putting Next on the left and Back on the right is not a good idea.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:36:43

It's not tied to Electrum, but the mechanics are similar (master seed consisting of English words, deterministic addresses, external address chain,  internal change address chain, etc.).

It might link your IP address to coins, but that's no different to any other client. It will surely not link your ID, because TREZOR is shipped "blank" and you setup it after you receive it.

While doing paper backup of TREZOR It's easer to write 24 words on a piece of paper than writing 60 random characters.
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:54:30
You don't need to attach keyboard and display to TREZOR (because it already has these).
Also we use Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP32+BIP39) so backups are really trivial. You never need to deal with private keys of the individual addresses, you just backup the master private seed (12, 18 or 24 words). I am not sure what method is used in ColdPi.

We were approached by Coindesk and sent them 2 units for review a month ago. Why there is still no reaction is puzzling for me as well. :-(
Around that time there was also a [first part of review]( by NewsBTC, which described more-or-less just the physical features of the device, but they haven't got to the second part yet. :-/

There is one solution:
Unfortunately it was not mature enough when we started making TREZOR, so that's why we went for the "old fashioned" C.
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:25:18
Yep, [these]( are real. Who is the unlucky one? :-)
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:00:23
This is possible of course! You need to initialize one TREZOR and import the recovery seed into the second one.
@_date: 2014-08-10 13:54:59
The first one was not standard. :-) Now you see BIP39 wallets popping everywhere (TREZOR, GreenAddress.it, Wallet32 on Android, upcoming Mycelium wallet, etc.). My guess is that Electrum will support BIP39 as well eventually.

Just change underlying data in openstreetmap and it will be reflected in coinmap after update (which happens every hour).

No. iOS is a walled garden. Unless you bribe Apple to include our VendorID and ProductID the operating system will not communicate with you.
Android is much better in that particular case and applications can even open automatically when you plug in a recognized device.

Payment from three different addresses is OK. Just make sure that total amount of coins received is correct (and paid in time).
On the other hand. We won't ship one order to three addresses.

The protocol that runs via USB is very limited and can only transfer just public keys and transactions. Private keys stay in the device at all times. That's the main idea behind TREZOR.

They never leave the device in digital form. The only way to store them is to read them visually from the display and write down to a piece of paper.

There is a preliminary support here:  
But it needs to be merged into Electrum source code first so users can use it directly.
Also the user experience is quite sketchy for the time being and you are better with using myTREZOR for now, but I hope this will get better in the future.

Paper wallets cannot spend Bitcoins by themselves. You need to load them somewhere and that's when the attacker strikes.

BadUSB is about devices attacking host (i.e. computer). Not about host attacking a device (i.e. TREZOR).

We thought about it, sounds like a neat idea. But we haven't come up with a good extension of BIP39 that deals with SSSS, yet.
@_date: 2014-04-02 11:55:42
12 words = 128 bits ; 18 words = 192 bits ; 24 words = 256 bits
Default is 12 words.
Citation from BIP-32:
"Generate a seed byte sequence S of a chosen length (between 128 and 512 bits; 256 bits is advised)"
While I agree that anything above 160 bits might be overkill, we want to give expert users a choice. All the rest can rely on default.
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:11:37
4) i don't know if browsers already solved the security of extensions, but i remember some extensions in the past that were replacing bitcoin addresses in all tabs, which is an absolute no-no for me

Originally it re-scrambled for every digit, but we found it too tedious to use during our user testing. Yes, we test with real people too! Not just developers. :-)
You are right about the second part, that's why we show PIN strength indicator in PIN dialog.
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:51:48
a) TREZOR uses RFC6979 for deterministic signatures (i.e. no RNG is involved during signing), so you know it is not leaking private data hidden in signatures.
b) TREZOR uses RNG only to generate its initial entropy (also known as master private seed). During this process a request for external entropy (from computer) is made and it is mixed with the internal entropy to generate the master private seed. There is also a mechanism that you can use to be 100% sure that this external entropy is indeed being used and not thrown away (basically by revealing internal entropy before asking for external one).
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:49:10
Unless it is A JOKE!  
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:27:45
If I understand it correctly, no changes are needed on the TREZOR side. BitID/BitAuth support is just a matter of using their JS libraries in conjunction with [trezor.js]( which communicates with the device.

If you add USB host to the design, one could attach hardware wallets like TREZOR to your device. *wink* ;-)
It seems you might need to switch to LPC2388, because LPC2387 doesn't have USB host, though . :-(
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:16:14


It already is present in the firmware, but the message does nothing except invalidating session on the device (effectively forgetting the PIN and passphrase) . What we will add in the next firmware update is the option to turn off the screen when the session is invalidated.
Also this message will be issued by myTREZOR after X minutes of inactivity.


It does not seem like a hard task to do.

Wow! What a bunch of incompetent liars. Using service out of your control over HTTP is reckless and plain stupid. Also their "fix" is a recipe for another disaster, because it uses more or less the same wrong method that needed to get patched on Android in August 2013. It's almost 2 years since, when the correct solution has been known.
This is what happens when you throw VC money at clueless people. You as community can decide! Please, support projects driven by intelligence and willingness to build something great, not companies whose goal is just profit and big exit.

It's a feature of BIP39.
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:02:33
TREZOR always asks for external entropy during its initialization, which is then mixed with the internal entropy to generate the seed. It has been like this since the very beginning of the project.
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:09:10
I still do think that decentralization is the key. Although myTREZOR is obviously the best way to interact with TREZOR device, there will be other TREZOR compatible software wallets that do not depend on our services soon.
@_date: 2014-08-02 20:42:53
Firmware is signed and if one flashes unofficial firmware TREZOR shows warning on every start.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:46:33
Hahaha, best answer ever! :-)
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:19:16
I guess your research was not that good, to be honest, because TREZOR has multi-coin support (BTC, LTC, DASH, ZCash, ETH/ETC).
Also I don't think "an average user" could write an app for any hardware wallet. Especially if the code is written in embedded C, the requirements on the person writing it are far more than "average user".
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:53:31
A little too big for my taste. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:54:05
If input value is part of the signed transaction data then yes.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:14:56
**Sweep:** As you correctly said, paper wallets are secure until the moment you want to use them. :-) We were thinking about that already and came up with a scheme similar to PIN entry which allows secure entering of the text. This method could be used not only for seed recovery but also to enter TREZOR passphrase, BIP38 passwords and other pieces of sensitive information. The problem with this method is that the letters with accents are not supported yet, so we'd need to think a little bit more so this can be used as universal string input method ...
@_date: 2017-02-06 15:51:00
If you use a wallet that supports BIP39+BIP44 standards you should be OK.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:24:39
Not affected, unless you created seed in broken version of Copay/other wallet that uses bitcore-lib and want to import that into TREZOR afterwards.

Yes. That's what we'll do. Firmware 1.2.1 is the last firmware released under the old license. All further changes are Microsoft Reference Source License (Ms-RSL) - the same Mycelium is using for their mobile wallets.

There is no such thing as finished research and development, it's an ongoing task.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:31:11
The main problem of this approach is not that buttons don't work by default (this can be fixed by recompiling the firmware).
The big issue which stays is that you are unable to distinguish between "original" SatoshiLabs firmware and any other firmware (which might contain backdoor) because both of them are marked as "Unofficial" when you start the device, which defeats the whole purpose of the check.
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:10:22

This is already fixed in the source code. Next release will contain this fix.


Constant time signing is around 2-times slower than regular signing. Even though timing attack threat is theoretical and drawback is practical, we are looking into this issue. Also our code already uses look-up-tables which make timing attack much much harder to perform.

Now when I have a TREZOR in my pocket I know it is powered off and my coins are safe.
If TREZOR had wireless I could not be 100% sure there is no exploit in the wireless chip that could somehow access the device's full memory contents while TREZOR is powered by battery.
For QR codes: there is a "hack" which allows you to embed one QR code into another and one device can scan the malicious one while another device will scan the correct one.

@_date: 2015-01-13 10:28:47
Right. Once we have an usable replacement ready, we'll update the Dockerfile to include this option, so it will be a truly standalone image.
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:27:32
From where I stand there are two valid usecases for a docker image:
a) for developing, so one does not have to install all devel dependencies into the main system
b) for deployment
Obviously the latter needs to be more complex and handle more things (not run apps as root, install things with proper permissions, etc.).
Dockerfile directly in our repo meets usecase a). What you describe is more or less usecase b). 
@_date: 2016-01-25 12:25:54
No they don't. This app does not use passphrases by default.
@_date: 2016-03-30 07:22:22
shilling - engaging in covert advertising; personally endorsing the product in public forums with the pretense of sincerity, when in fact being paid for the services
I suppose that CEO of the company is being paid by the company, so, that's a yes in my book.
Don't get me wrong, I don't think that shilling is always necessarily bad, but when your contributions are almost exclusively shilling, then it can annoy more sensitive people like me. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:03:28
Actually, TREZOR is much more resistant against drop because it is lighter.

@_date: 2015-01-31 16:31:54


See three commits mentioned in my last comment of this issue: 


I am not downplaying the problem, I also mentioned that we are looking into it. All I said was that using a look-up-table already makes it much harder to successfully perform.
@_date: 2015-01-30 21:29:56
Not sure if it was the best, but it surely worked.
@_date: 2016-03-25 09:47:43
Actually the costumer needs to pay the custom duties, not us, so we don't save anything. Lots of people were unhappy because they had trouble explaining at the customs what this device is, what is Bitcoin, etc. So this is done to make the process smoother for you.

The suggestion with GPG encryption was very bad. The whole reason for hardware wallets is that the secret never touches a possibly compromised computer. If you initialize TREZOR and then retype the recovery seed to a computer to encrypt it using a GPG, you basically invalidated the whole idea behind HW wallets.

Let me just add one thing. Arduino is quite a bad example, because I think we cannot immediately learn anything from it.
Arduino folks do almost no software development (most of the heavy lifting was done by the Wiring project) and don't provide any services. On the other hand, we do a lot of software development and provide services and support for these services. In a nutshell: Arduino is a hardware-based company and SatoshiLabs is a software-based company.

That's exactly what passphrase protection is for. You can give away many passphrases, but only a few will contain some coins.

As Iong as there are application processor and broadband processor colocated in one chip, you can never be sure there is no network communication going on without you even knowing about it.
If broadband chip was separate like wifi chip, you could have destroyed them both, but currently this is not possible on most of the phones because of the reason above.
Also airplane mode is a software switch not  hardware switch like rfkill that could have been found on old IBM laptops.
That said, using this solution for storing smaller amounts is most probably OK.

You are mixing passphrase and mnemonic (aka recovery seed or recovery sentence).
Passwords are generated from the seed, so they can be recovered using mnemonic sentence. What is mentioned above is usage of the additional passphrase (on top of the recovery seed).

Your BIP is missing formal header (see BIP-0001 for example: BIP, Title, Status, Type, Created). It seems weird that this got merged.

Yes, you should. It communicates with myTREZOR, which is "cooperating website" in Chrome jargon.

Most probably not. All these passwords manager use master password which unlocks everything once entered and they are unable to unlock one password at a time, which we do in TPM. Therefore, completely different security architecture =&gt; too much work on integration =&gt; not worth the hassle.

BIP44 in Bitcoin Core needs to come first. Now it is just BIP32 with a different scheme, which is not sufficient.

That is, of course, true even before the Password Manager.

We have such consultants reaching us quite often and we know we could save by shifting the manufacturing to China. But we don't want to do that and we actively refuse such offers.

Of course you can. It's in the trezor-mcu repo together with build instructions.
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:49:18
Because you reveal it to the computer, which can be compromised, when you want to login.
Challenge-response system between the server and a security device such as TREZOR can work even on compromised computer and is much more secure by design.
2fa is better than plain passwords, but still it is possible to go around it (with social engineering, forcing gsm operators to cooperate, etc.)

Not really. The keys used for Bitcoins and Password Manager are different from different subtrees of BIP32 hierarchy.
Also you don't have to use your real name in Dropbox.

You should try for yourself to make your own opinion.
@_date: 2016-01-31 23:56:45
No. This tag just gives away the private key, the terminal sweeps it and returns the extra coins back, so you need to trust it. Also you should not send more than 20 EUR to this NFC tag.
That said, even if the tag was more intelligent and was singing the transaction by itself while not revealing the private key, you still need to trust the terminal that it does not ask for more coins than you want.
One way how to solve this would be to create a multisig address and add a second key to your phone, where you can read the amount. But this would be extra hassle and not as convenient as touch of a hand.
@_date: 2017-01-26 14:04:03
That was not what the poster above asked about.
Also, I do think that if you are not a target, you have nothing to worry about. If you are a target and your adversary has lot of resources, they can break into both MCU and SE for comparable amount of money. (So yes, 3 million dollars can be seen as much more than 1 million dollars, but not a big difference for an adversary, really). For this reason we have a passphrase protection, which also provides plausible deniability.
@_date: 2019-03-13 08:53:07
The protection is in the firmware, not the bootloader.
Let's assume the attack is possible. I don't see why you can't do the same attack on Ledger. Once it is the generic MCU that is connected to USB, display and buttons, not the secure element, it's done. The generic MCU would do all the nasty stuff and use SE just for attestation when needed.
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:04:34
Maybe you believe that Bitcoin/IPFS/Tor will not succeed unless they have enough supporters running their own nodes.
Maybe you made enough money by speculating with Bitcoin that you want to contribute something back without any immediate gain.

**This still does not circumvent fix in 1.5.2**
Why? It is described in lengthy detail here (also includes an explanation why we do not encrypt storage): 
Also you are safe when you use a passphrase!


Because it is a way how to load software during the production into the device. Even if it were not there, an attacker could still access the individual pins on the chip. This could be circumvented by putting the chip in tar, but this is a security by obscurity thing anyway and would just slow down the attacker, not stop him completely.

I agree that even blackhat attack will make device more secure in the long run. I'll go even that far to claim that there are some good ideas or points to think about in the article.
I just dislike how he ignores important factors, such as existence of passphrase. Suggesting encryption, while it is not really an option. Claiming that hack works on the updated firmware too. Laughing about the existence of debug port in production boards, while he must know why it is there, etc. Trying to scam people for 20 BTC for non-existent exploit being a cherry on top.
All this is causing more harm than good for the whole community in the long run. We are not trying to minimize the importance of the work, but I think that same facts could have been presented (even publicly) in much less malicious way, hence the FUD label. Maybe you have a different definition of FUD, like you say ...

And it will eventually get fixed, rendering your exploits useless. You should've know better.

If the coins are moved you now that something happened.
When someone copies your mnemonic, you don't suspect a thing and keep sending more coins into TREZOR. Attacker might wait for a couple of months or years and then steal much more of your coins.
That's the difference.

@_date: 2016-02-18 12:03:00
You can, but I would not recommend it, because you would lower the entropy of the result. (For example brain would not pick a seed that has the same word 4 times in a row, but this is a perfectly valid option). Read the spec on how the checksum is computed and if your manually generated seed passes this test, then it is a valid seed.
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:51:33


You can at least audit what goes in and what goes out. With integrated platforms you can't do even this.
I agree TrustZone a step forward in protection against malware. But not against the big players. The pure fact, that we are putting more and more stuff into one chip driven by one single proprietary blob is making me not happy. And this is not just about TrustZone, but also e.g. Intel putting the whole platform (including GPU and Wireless) in one chip, etc.

Does one still have to pay to become an editor of Bitcoin Wiki? If yes, I don't like the idea of making this a comment platform. Github offers wiki for each repo and we can utilise that.

There are two issues with raising block size limit.
1) network propagation of larger blocks
2) size of the whole blockchain
Your solution solves issue  but not 
Issue  is bad for decentralization, because fewer people can run nodes (only ones with a good connection). But  is bad as well, because it limits running full nodes to ones with a big storage. We can argue that  is a problem and  is not, because bandwidth is expensive and disks are not, but  might also become a big problem in the future.

4 years ago (when TREZOR was still a project in our heads) we were thinking about audio jack as a way how to transfer data. The problem was with various Android devices and their very different circuitry, where it was almost impossible to get all important details right. Also the transfer speed was not very fast (a kilobyte per second), which might be enough for transmitting signature of a hash, but not enough for streaming the whole transaction inside of the device, like it is done today.
Edit: I found some of my ancient code (5 years+) for desktop and Android:

The main problem of TEE/TrustZone is that the TEE/TrustZone lies in the same package as the main CPU, so one cannot audit what kind of communication happens between these two. Hell, even the broadband chip that connects to GSM is in the same package. If we lived in a word where major vendors did not put backdoors in their hardware, this news would be really exciting. But reading all the stuff about Apple's version of TrustZone called Secure Enclave and how they can^ update its logic without weeping out the data it's holding makes me more and more skeptical about this approach. :-/
^ For now they don't want to, but they certainly can. This might change in the future by just wiping the data before updating the Enclave, but this is not a technical problem but a political one. Interesting discussion about the topic:

It's not about the size of the signed transaction, but about the fact you don't need to stream all transactions that form inputs of the signed transaction. (This needs to be done for "old" transactions to confirm values of the inputs. Segwit transactions hashes values of inputs, so this does not need to be done.)

I agree we should stop using the word mnemonic, but rather use "recovery seed". It is not a master key (the master key is computed from recovery seed). Let's not call this recovery phrase either as it can be confused with bip39 passphrase.
I am 100% sure we need to keep calling the private key as the private key (maybe secret key?).
Also public key is not an address. Users rarely interact with these, they use addresses most of the time. So let's not confuse these two.
Lastly, bip39 is passphrase, not password or anything similar.

It's just a matter of time until Ledger becomes interesting to hack on and people will find something. The lesson here is that with TREZOR you have more flexibility to fix the issue once it appears, because you are not tied to the unmodifiable environment of Secure Element.

No it can't bypass that (for receiving addresses).

For TREZOR we mitigated the receiving address replacement attack by forcing user to check their address on the device at the time it is being created. Simple, yet effective solution.
For addresses being sent to you (from your friend, etc.) you need to perform verification using another channel (phone for example).

This is true for any technology including a secure enclave. If you have specific knowledge and tools, you can hack anything.
Arguably, most of the second half of the article is untrue. After the last Ledger hack it is obvious, that their solution suffers from the same [supply-chain attack]( problem which renders their attestation useless. Funnily enough, hologram is one of the ways how to fix their issue.

For TREZOR we mitigated the receiving address replacement attack by forcing user to check their address on the device at the time it is being created. Simple, yet effective solution.
For addresses being sent to you (from your friend, etc.) you need to perform verification using another channel (phone for example).
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:48:24
Exactly this. I don't subtract 1 from number of transactions in my charts ( so I get consistently results one higher than the other tool and for this block I get 0 segwit transactions.

No, it's not Segwit. It is Multisig address as they are using BitGo. (Both Multisig and Segwit use P2SH format which starts with 3).

You are safe to update in that case.

It's much more specialized attack, because it would need to disable parts of the application. It's much harder to perform than just a simple address replacement, especially if the app keeps changing every day.

Hardware wallets that follow BIP32/BIP44 such as TREZOR generate new addresses with each transaction, which means that coins are always moved to new address which is shielded from quantum attack; because the public key of and address is unknown before it is actually used - when the public key is revealed - for the first time, the only thing that is known is the hash of the public key and hashes are quantum resistant.

A good example showing why FIPS 140-2 and Common Criteria secure elements are never a silver bullet. Security of the whole solution always depends also on software and clever developers and researchers, who provide peer review.
Full disclosure: I personally know 2 of the researchers and I was approached in February. After explaining that TREZOR does not use RSA we did not continue researching this topic further. When there will be similar research that applies to TREZOR we will be happy to collaborate with them or any other security team.

BitFi is basically a closed-source TREZOR running with a full-blown OS (Android), with a preloaded constant recovery seed that cannot be changed,  disabled PIN protection and enabled passphrase protection.

It seems there is something called Pageant mentioned on a PuTTY website. It seems it does the same thing as ssh-agent. If someone made an agent similar to trezor-agent (i.e. tool communicating with TREZOR via python-trezor on one side and ssh-agent/Pageant on the other) it would be possible to achieve exactly the same thing.

You need to initialize it first in order to use it. You can use Android app for that if you don't want to do it on myTREZOR.com. Another option is to use command-line interface of python_trezor (`trezorctl reset_device --help` is your friend).
@_date: 2016-10-18 12:32:02
Calling command with `--help` option IS a manual. What do you not understand?
Just use `trezorctl reset_device -p` to setup TREZOR with PIN, or  `trezorctl reset_device -p -r` to setup it with PIN and passphrase.

TREZOR does not depend on proprietary secure elements and its security model is not built around it. The main advantage of TREZOR is that it's open which also means it is fixable if extraction ever becomes possible. This is not true for secure elements, because you'd need to replace all of them in order to fix them (in other words there is no easy fix by releasing a firmware update).

Remember: TREZOR will not perform any operation involving private keys, unless you enter your PIN first.
After Jochen's hack in 2015, we worked together and fixed all known side channel attacks. In case there are still some left, I believe no one can extract a private key without prior knowledge of PIN. In case attacker knows the PIN, she can send coins right away, without messing with some kind of attack.
Last but not least, we were not contacted by anyone from Cryptotronix, LLC, so I think they will not reveal anything serious, because I'd expect them to do a responsible disclosure first, in case they were.
That said, I am interested in the talk and will pay full attention to it when it is released.

You can enter recovery seed in a way that computer does not know about it either: 
Also even before that was implemented, you were entering the seed in shuffled order, which is IMO still a very good tradeoff when it comes to balancing security and usability.
Thirdly, there was absolutely NO ISSUE with TREZOR and the airports reported to us so far.
I get it that you like Nano S and that's perfectly fine, but once you started using it more than TREZOR you stopped educating yourself about TREZOR and are stating some things as facts, while they are not, just to support your decision. And this is not very right.

In the original ECDSA concept you need 256 bits of random data for every signature. This poses a problem, because when you sign two different messages (i.e. bitcoin transactions) using the same random input, you leak your private key. RFC6979 proposes to use the output of HMAC-SHA256(private_key, message) instead of the random data, which eliminates this risk. Also it helps to write unit tests around ECDSA because suddenly it is deterministic and behaves everytime the same.

First time you start TREZOR it will print out a sentence (see BIP39) that can be used for paper backup. Using this sentence you can recover your Bitcoins into another TREZOR and/or software wallet that supports BIP39.

When denominating the price in fiat currency it's the early adopters who are screwed badly (like we've seen in every mining hardware business). We don't want to do this, because these are the people who helped the most to make TREZOR a real thing.

I would like to introduce a weekend project we did with my friend Split. PaperCoin is a website that provides a very simple way for people to print out paper offline Bitcoin wallets. Once folded, the private key is hidden inside while the address is still visible from the outside. It's a great way for introducing your friends to Bitcoin. All cryptography and PDF creation happens in Javascript in your browser and nothing is sent back to server. You can even download the source code (yes, it's open source!) and run the software locally, if you wish.
This is how the output page and folded wallet look like: [link](
Feedback, ideas and patches are appreciated, of course!
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:32:10
We thought about this but ...
... you'd need to include a battery into the device.
... you need to be online to broadcast a transaction - so you end up with adding wifi.
This might be something for version 2.0, but for now we want to focus just on the most problematic part of Bitcoin - which is security, not mobility.

When you put this shield on top of a Raspberry Pi and run a trezor-emulation software on it, the whole will behave exactly like the  product. This allows software developers to work on Trezor integration even before the real product is shipped to its costumers.

It reveals master public key (aka BIP32 xpub node). This is confirmed via user interaction by pressing a tactile button on the device.
Golden rule of TREZOR is that private keys NEVER leave the device. Also each address is used just once and never reused (unless user explicitly wants to do so). That should reasonably mitigate this problem.

Not exactly. Imagine an algorithm that appends well known sequence to your seed and hashes the concatenated data - something like:
That way you can generate an infinite sequence of 256-bit private keys from 128-bit seed. The actual process is a little bit more complex, but the idea is more or less the same. See  if you are into crypto. :-)

Nice. Once it will contain deterministic signing it might be a viable replacement of python-ecdsa in Bitcoin projects.

Problem is the device does not know the balance unless it is connected to the computer.

It will be a part of upcoming BIP 0039. Very similar to the thing Electrum already does.

We are devoted to deliver all pre-orders even if they were just a few. The more, the merrier of course, because we can optimize our processes better.

If your phone has USB Host (aka OTG) there's no reason why you could not use TREZOR with your smartphone. Providing there is an app for it with TREZOR support.

It's only easier to get the list of addresses that donated (and how much) - which is not a good thing, of course. But to keep your address anonymous/untraceable is your task, not theirs.

It's powered from USB cable. So if it is detached it has no juice. Key is safe, because it is stored in Flash memory. For backup options search this thread for "paper".

CNC milling is much more expensive process than mold casting.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:10:24
Yes, you nailed it. The visiblity outside of the Bitcoin community was the main reason why we wanted to go for Kickstarter. The reality is, we spent quite a lot of time on preparing Kickstarter stuff and in the end they failed us.

Exactly about generating weak signatures. RFC6979 solves this problem.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:34:35
It is from state of the art crypto-js Javascript library. The same one is used in bitaddress.org or brainwallet.org. I'm unsure if someone has put the libary under extensive testing, though.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:14:44
Plug to your computer. Create transaction in the software. Sign it in the device. Done.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:18:42
Yes, it is very similar. In near future Trezor, Electrum, MultiBit and hopefully other Bitcoin wallets will support this new scheme (which is a combination of BIP0032 and BIP0039).

App doesn't protect you from viruses and various attacks. Dedicated hardware does.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:37:25
Yes, you translated it correctly. Thanks!
I didn't go into specifics, because frankly, even I don't know them. People at Kickstarter were pointing to various things, but they were very vague and unable to tell us what exactly is wrong with our campaign. Another issue was that every iteration took a day or two and we were quickly running out of our time. (San Jose Conference where we announced a Kickstarter campaign was in May.)
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:55:19
Yes, lots of things have changed since then and now you can import seed to TREZOR.
About the PIN issue - we'll publish the method soon.
@_date: 2013-06-01 19:55:52
Hi! Sadly there was a major holdback by Kickstarter - no reaction for two weeks. Finally they are communicating now and we hope to resolve the issues by the end of the next week. Unfortunately this is completely out of our control, but I agree we should have communicated these problems better.
@_date: 2013-04-24 08:47:59
By the time an attacker is able to dump the chip your Bitcoins are sent to a different wallet by using your paper backup.
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:02:46
Thanks. We'd hoped more people from the community think like that.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:14:45
Yes. This one is imho vaporware.

Right now we have just a limited count of these Raspberry Pi shields which we'll ship to developers. If there is a continuous demand for these, we might consider making another batches for non-developers as well.

Importing privkey will be an expert only option, because it requires a secure computer and there is plethora of other problems like you described above for example.
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:11:12
No. It uses Electrum scheme. BIP32 is not standard yet (it is still a draft). But once finished I'll add the support.
@_date: 2013-06-22 11:48:40
I hope this will enable all of you to create your own Bitcoin eshops and/or crowdfunding pages.
@_date: 2013-06-23 00:34:19
You generate Master Seed in Electrum client on its first run. It will also show you Master Public Key during the generation process - this is the information you provide to the script.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:51:29
Not at the moment. There were some problems in the process - mainly polishing of the final case. And according to machining people aluminium looks much more nicer.

Added QR codes for private keys in latest version!
@_date: 2013-06-16 13:12:35
Yes. You can only transfer unsigned transactions to the device and signed ones out of the device. Any other packets are discarded because they are treated as unknown.
@_date: 2013-10-14 21:15:19
I just finished cleaning up code from the Hive team and deployed it on CoinMap.org. ZipZap support is disabled for now, because I want to learn more about the service before I start advertising it.
But for now you can enjoy around 1000 geo points fetched from LocalBitcoins!
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:49:44
Yes. Someone created OSM point which links to localbitcoins profile. Clearly a spam - I'm going to delete it.
Edit: Argh. There are more (7) of these ... removing. /o\
People, stop spamming OSM with your LocalBitcoins ads!
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:58:06
Thanks! We wish Alu price was lower as well, but unfortunately the cnc milling process is just too expensive :-(
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:16:34
No. You would need to know Master Private Key (or seed) to be able to do that. Addrgen works with Master Public Key only - so it's safe to put it on your server for example.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:59:26
1. Upon device reset it will print 12 words (just for this one occasion) which you'll write down on paper and these serve as a regular paper seed backup. That way you can use this seed and send your bitcoins to another Trezor or completely different wallet if the original one is stolen or broken.
2. The whole design will be open-sourced (hardware and software) so everyone is welcome to review.

It seems this is a bug in jsPDF - the same happens with their basic example. I might look into that, but for now please use Chrome/Firefox.

OTR does not work if the second party if offline, because you can't exchange the keys. In Threema you do it in person via QR codes.

That address does not belong to Wikileaks. The only mention of the address was on bitcoin-charity.info, where it was listed as Wikileaks address. The website is now offline, probably belongs to attacker as well.
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:08:22
Yes, but if we'd reached a funding goal (and I'm pretty sure we would), then the risk is the same, because Kickstarter does not provide any extra insurance for backers.

Hopefully fixed. Can you please confirm?
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:38:50
Transactions are generated in a software wallet, but TREZOR has the private keys and is signing them. That's an extra security feature when compared to Yubikey for example.

Until we have FAQ section on our website please read  - it contains your answers.

Once you again unfold the wallet, there is a private key inside (series of numbers and letters starting with number 5). You import this private key into your client and the balance stored in the wallet is added to your total balance.

These were made for a rather informal Bitcoin/Security conference, where we more or less knew each other. But I agree that we should post an updated version.

The private keys never leave the device, so computer malware cannot steal them.

Their API is far from optimal. I already sent a request ticket. Let's wait for the answer.

We try hard to force people to do paper backup during the device initialization.
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:39:01
TREZOR generates the private seed by itself. That's why you don't need a clean secure computer to begin with.
@_date: 2013-06-23 09:56:38
I don't want to. This code is meant to be run on server-side, where you should never publish your private keys.
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:29:14
They were irresponsive in the beginning and then they started to have ridiculous demands on our campaign, so we decided to do preorders our own way.
