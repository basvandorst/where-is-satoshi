when stupid people attack bitcoin don't realize if bitcoin drop 20% others will drop 40% and if bitcoin lose value others follow too. 
I am talking about bitcoin cash community and other coins when they think they can replace the bitcoin with trashy coins.
bitcoin is the king of the cryptocurrency. respect the king.

BitcoinCash is BitcoinTrash. soon people will realize it.

it will go up as soon as people learn to HODL 
so simple just buy and do noting. forget about day trading. day trading is only stressing you and mentally make you tired. serious money made in long term holding. 
buy and hold for minimum 1 year.
buy and forget about it. come back and check it next year.

yes because bitcoin is currency. is cash is money 
yes you can not fund your stock trading account with credit card too. why do you expect to buy bitcoin with credit card then. ??? 
why people make a big deal of this news. is not negative news at all.

add Litecoin too. Litecoin is great for micro transaction due to very low transaction fee.
