The economy would be saved if we found a way to stop endless growth

How is the burden of proof pretty low? What could he do to prove he was robbed, if it’s that easy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:36:12
I like how you're asking him to prove he's been robbed when that's what law enforcement is getting paid to do lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:40:17
You do realize that in order to prove that someone robbed him law enforcement would also have to prove the robbery even took place, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:40:50
That would be about 8 times the entire world's GDP so probably not

Yeah right big charts are just a way for Chinese chart makers to collect more fees.

Cause people are still buying printed newspapers just like people didn't stop buying books just because of e-books.

If I created my own currency right now everybody else would be poorer than me in relation to their coin holdings.

"Free money"
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:30:01
Because people say "The Pound" or "the pound sterling"
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:51:19
You're wrong. Also, you don't know what language he was talking. In Germany for example, publications use "The Bitcoin" regularly. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 10:09:23
Because Bitcoin is a currency and it's common to use "the" when talking about currencies. We say "the Dollar", "the Euro".

There are plenty of people like me who'd give more of their countries sovereignty to the EU. It's a great institution to me so my vote will always be with parties who want to strengthen it. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:34:05
Because it's not the ECB that makes the regulations. Just because Draghi says it's not within HIS organizations' power doesn't mean the EU or national governments won't attempt to regulate Bitcoin.

I didnt say he could exchange them quickly. I said it's more practical than getting your cash seized. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 08:54:28
Individual countries could limit trade of bitcoin to specific exchanges or declare trading and possessing bitcoin illegal outright. The ECB can't. Whether it could work is a different story.. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:42:57
Yes it's coming soon.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:40:38
More impractical than going through a lawsuit for a slim chance at seeing that money again ever? 
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:23:30
Good article. Really informative and not just baseless speculation.

Her body is hot for sure. I just think the boobs are a bit far apart so I think the boob job wasn't so good. Maybe the implants were too big? From my limited knowledge of plastic surgery fake boobs can look a bit weird when they're too big. It's nothing I'd care much about if she was in front of me. 
Edit: breast augmentation is very interesting:




@_date: 2017-10-08 21:59:33
Yeah a shoddy job there's so much space between the boobs

I give you $2 for a burger. I sell you two dollars for a burger. I give you 1 bitcoin for a gaming PC. I sell you 1 bitcoin for a gaming pc.

If they can, Bitcoin is a broken project anyway. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 09:04:00
Hmm I guess the whole world of finance, including the crypto world. Calling them "dinosaurs" and "antiquated" doesn't change the fact that they're still the ones calling the shots.

Always buy shortly before a boom and sell at the very top, that way you may profits!
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:18:53
Everybody is trying to buy low and sell high. Your "strategy" is what people try to do every day. But it's easier said than done. There's a reason actively managed stock portfolios can't beat passive investing. Even funds managers with years of training and experience can't beat the stock markets, and the same goes for crypto. If you think you're a trading prodigy then by all means go try but if you're asking questions like "is buying low and selling high profitable? My plan is to buy low and sell high", I doubt it. Just Hodl.
@_date: 2017-07-13 07:39:45
Well if you agree that it's wrong then there's no reason to be upset that people are complaining about it. You're the hypocrite here, not them.

It's okay to admit you're wrong, you know?

Invoking the Irish potato famine would have been just as bad. This has nothing to do with PC culture. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:06:22
RemindMe! 1 year 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:46:59
So on one hand you're saying it's wrong, on the other hand you're saying it's just fake PC culture? What's your position? Are the authors right or wrong to do this?
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:57:08
Did you consider that many people don't go to university to make as much money as possible later?

More people buying and trading bitcoin makes fiat money lose value. Banks and businesses run on fiat money. Banks starts giving out fewer loans because they'll lose money by the time they get it back. Governments can't print bitcoin to bail the banks out. The whole debt-fueled world economy collapses before humanity enters a new golden age. Asset-holders win.
