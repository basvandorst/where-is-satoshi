BTCE got hacked for 4500BTC back in the day
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:24:10
the txs are only signed by two. and the backup was not used. ie bitfinex and bitgo signed.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:44:33
and if done a year and a half ago we would of be in a much better position and not be rushing for segwit.

Yea let's put all our eggs in one basket and keep doing risky experiments with everyones money on the line. Totally pointless to try out experimental smart contracts and increased capacity on other smaller altcoins. In fact let's shit talk devs experimenting on other block chains and call all their work scams because I'm greedy and only want consumers pumping BTC.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:05:44
We already know what keys were used to sign. And the backup was not. 
Bitgo had to sign these txs
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:59:04
naw I got in around 2012. And back then bitcoiners would say send any amount of money with no fee's! or send millions for less then a penny! as back then bitcoin was 7 bucks and .0001 was sub 1cent. 
Things are very different now. I've seen some of my large input tx's cost me 35$ plus. more expensive then a bank wire!

Lightning is not cash. sidechains are not p2p. You should not need to hold money in escrow in order to send/receive money.
You are giving up on satoshi's vision if you cant figure out how to scale on chain. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 05:56:20


no, Gavin said they would get full. And even predicted it a year and half in advance. And they are full now. and fee's are skyrocketing and users are getting left out in the cold for simply sending fee's that were perfecting acceptable yesterday.

webwallets are insecure. This has the same security as a trezor or other hardware wallet.

Maybe not. But it can be observed by subscribing to the mempool. Relay times are generally miliseconds. Even globally.
@_date: 2016-08-16 05:52:30
no, he simply wants a bitcoin big enough for everyone with fee's low enough even the poor can use it.
We have a tiny userbase now and already full. and even with segwit we don't have room to grow. fee's are averaging 30 cents and half the world lives off 2 dollars a day.

your telling me a 100$ trezor would of prevented 70million dollar loss. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:01:13
that is what users see. They pay a high fee and get skipped. if you worked a support desk and some one asked you why their .0006 tx has been waiting for 3 hours. What are you going to tell them? a .0004 tx was included in a last block so its all good bro?
if you monitor the mempool you can get those numbers. They are a real indicator at how bad it is for users. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:02:41
This is horrible if you accidentally send counterparty or mastercoin assets into the system. Completely unrecoverable. I've herd stories of support refusing this as well. Costing users their funds.

@_date: 2016-08-02 23:48:14
false, bitgo only gives instant from other bitgo customers. A tiny percentage for any bussiness.
They are pushing a multi-sig security model instead of cold storage. AND THIS IS DEEPLY FLAWED.
ANYTHING CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET IS HACK-ABLE.
Trezor, Keepkey, ledger.
The future of bitcoin is in hardware NOT SOFTWARE. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:29:44
no bitgo holds 2 keys. bitfinex only 1. well technically the 3rd is a backup agent. but built by bitgo not bitfinex. 
Bitgo must of signed these tx's on request from bitfinex.

@_date: 2016-08-06 23:58:11


1. release the txid's. its going to be released one way or the other as we can figure it out ourselves. as we figured out the amounts beforehand as well anyway.
2. release the rules that bitgo were supposed to follow.(this should of been public knowledge beforehand) (or confirm that indeed you did not have have any rules and bitgo was a blind signatory as most are suspecting.)


is not as good of a job as the community can do. keeping us in the dark is hurting you as much as its annoying us. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 17:39:28
I think you are in the wrong sub. This sub only wants bitcoin as a settlement layer for the rich. not a digital cash for everyone.
tx fee's are averaging over 30cents a tx. and half the world lives on 2$ a day.
Bitcoin cant even scale to the rich of one country, much less reach the poor. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 04:16:50
they will be transferable. and you can sell them to other people at under market value. Therefor people can gamble by buying them under market price betting that they will be redeemed at a later date at full value.
so most people can dump them on the market who have 0 trust left in bitfinex, and gamblers can throw away their money buying them.

paper wallets you can not prove you didnt copy. Have you even read the article?
The point of this is you can 1. prove there is money on it. 2. prove you don't also have access to that money after transfer.

Is exactly what we have been fighting for the last two years. to implement the solutions we have now to make time for whats to come. that is what bip101 was about. but we waited too long and our indecisiveness has been damaging bitcoin. now it is about damage control.

sub 1cent is pretty much free in my book. and why people would say free even if it wasn't really. I've never used bitcoin without a fee. i just remember when the USD value as so low almost no one cared or even talked much about fee's.

You gave away customer deposits that at the time was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. And today are worth much more.
You have said ETC withdrawals will be opened up for gdax. When? Will you be taking ETC from other non gdax customers cold storage to cover the losses? Do you have any regret at all for letting users game so much value out of your system for what would have been a simple 10 line contract?
If ETC keeps gaining value will you still be able to cover withdrawals?
Do you have any regret continually throwing away customers funds who accidentally send you ETC?
Have you learned to detect contract payments yet?
I'm available for consultation.

None of the proposals work like cash. Lighting requires money held in escrow and is not decentralized. Sidechains as well are not decentralized nor p2p. people are better off going to altcoins.

it would be trivial to make wallets automatically forward to a new addresses on a set time scheduled. It is impossible to prove a transfer is to a 2nd person or to yourself. so you cant enforce it and it wont do anything but annoy a couple dev's who need to make minor changes to counter it.

yea, but trying to defend ideologically I think is generally hard to do and not come out looking weak. especially on their kind of points in this example.

not a buttcoiner. I actually thought mark was a very intelligent guy and interacted with him a bit on IRC. If he actually had a project manager and spent time building a company and not doing everything himself MTgox would still dominate the bitcoin market today. and bitcoin itself would be much better off. Just because a Dev can do everything doesn't mean its smart or should be allowed too.

@_date: 2015-12-10 21:45:24
yea, fair enough.
but think about it. There really isn't much they can do. If they tried to initiate a transfer to empty your account you can just cancel it.
 all the other info in there is already given to them.
no full card numbers are accessible though the portals anyway.

i'm criticizing the foundation not you. if you were there telling them any money spent trying to play politics was a waste I would of supported you.
people in bitcoin we know anyone from DC or from the establishment says they are here to help you run in the opposite direction.
the previous leadership wasted the money and because of there poor judgement we don't have a foundation any more.
if you try to move forward you need to make sure you tell people you will never do that again.
providing guidance to bitcoin businesses and telling them to leave NCY and how to fight the establishment is money well spent. Trying to change the system by playing them at there own game was foolish, naive, reckless, and hurt bitcoin more then helped. it hurt us because we no longer have a foundation.  
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:48:58
Coinbase as a wallet will block you sending receiving from *bad addresses. Censoring Gambling, darknets, porn  and the like. This is the root of coin validation and destroys bitcoins fungibility. 
They claim they have to do it for their licences. Fine, but they need to stop trying to be a wallet and focus on broker/exchange's
For the record im only in favor of not listing it as a wallet, everyware of how to buy bitcoin it should be number1. And this also unrelated to the current debate. But I too said yay and figured I'd tell you why
I look forward to the day we get a zerocoin implementation and effectively destroy their busseness model and make it impossible  for them to do their job. Maybe shutting them down for good because of the legal ramifications.

Well considering bitcoin.org doesn't list exchanges/brokers at all, only wallet's. I'm kinda OK with it for completely unrelated reasons.
A wallet that can only be used to send/received to whitelisted addresses is not a bitcoin wallet. It's a centralized payment system built on top of bitcoin.
It should still be number 1 on how to buy bitcoins and its kinda weird that they link offsite for that.

If I wanted USD, id just hold usd in my bank where I can actually spend it. Coinbase has a model, interfacing with banks. If I don't want to hold btc I sell to my bank. 
Even coinbase could operate without holding my keys...
they know this, why they are building tools to do this. hence it has a future. Because if they didn't eventually some one else would come and do what they do better.
sorry, but pretending it means anything when a central party holds your money and tells you what its worth is bs.
pretending this has any value without banking ties is silly. and even then as long as they are controlling our funds I just don't see it having a future, because other people are working on options where you can.

coinbase does the same thing.
Mainly because legacy banking doesn’t even know what an API is really. Much less how to let 3rd parties verify information about their customers. 
im mean, if you change your password to 12345btcjam, let them verify, then change it back to something secure instantly after. its really not end of the world and defiantly faster then waiting for ACH deposits. 
Id do it to verify my coinbase again, instant account setup really was worth it.

Blocks are getting full sporadically. Full blocks means network congestion AKA slow confirmation times. slow confirmation times mean people come here and bitch. annoying all of us.
3 camps:
* Hard fork: something we have never done (on purpose) and very dangerous. basically make all of the changes we want to and force everyone to update.
* Seg Witness: about 3/4 of block data is taken by signatures. taking a page from bitshares we can increase the amount of potential tx's in the block by removing the signatures and validating them in a separate client/service. and the most import part is this can be implemented currently with a soft-fork. something we have done many times and generally is safe.
* do nothing: some people say TX congestion is just a normal thing and just calm the fuck down. The best solution is raising fee's. Expensive transactions make it so it is very expensive to fill the blocks dishonestly. (aka spam)
miners generally like this because expensive means more money for them. and core dev's kinda like this because it involves them doing nothing and can sit in there safe little bubbles.

@_date: 2015-12-10 21:48:42
hmm, no. coinbase only needs web-credentials to expedite verification. 
they do all their transfers over ACH. so a lot of users just do the ACH penny deposit to verify and never give out there bank password. 
also, I changed my PW instantly after the verify and never had any issues. (*with coinbase)

SPV as outlined in Satoshi's whitepaper is any wallet that is verifying payments without running a full node. 


a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain.
so yes, SPV wallets are by far the most popular and practical wallets to run hands down, no questions asked. 
for instance I would absolutely never in a million years recommend bitcoin core to a new user. I recommend Electrum on desktop, schildbach (bitcoinj) on android and breadwallet on IOS.  All of which are SPV

False, a purchase as a transaction has a set of risks. You can insure agienst the risks or you can minimize them. By useing CC you are risking that you might get fooled proving idenity. That is why people prefure cash. Authincate the cash not the user. Bitcoin does that digitally. Making insuring digital transactions much easier. CC is like leaving all you money on a table in front of your house in plain site an wondering why it gets taken. 50 years of insurance might help protect you get money back if stolen.

regardless of intentions (assuming they wouldn't run away with coin just because they can) not a single hotwallet service provider has succeeded in accomplishing this long term. (with possible exception of coinbase)
instawallet, inputs.io, Flexcoin, bips, Poloniex, Mtgox kinda hurts to keep going thinking about how much coin has been lost.
all these services had a distinct attraction with the ability to do proof of reserves if they chose too. (because bitcoin has a public ledger and they can hold bitcoin reserves 1:1)
This service has no ability to do proof of reserves as they should not be holding all there reserves in bitcoin anyway. They need to leverage against the price falling. They could attempt to prove they hold gold or dollar's but that has already been proven time and time again to be impossible to do reliably.

wouldn't it be better to *Force* atm owners using unreliable api's to hold at least the max transaction in a local wallet on the atm itself. and then not allow the unit to start a new transaction until the atm's wallet is refilled from the exchange api?
or better yet, if your into a running central service for robocoin itself. have robocoin run a hotwallet, and then send customers money from your accounts, and let the withdrawals from the api's buffer back to you.

fallacy, the daily limits many talk about refer to prepaid access. 
prepaid access


or the 10k reporting rule
that businesses that sell more than $10,000 of any type of prepaid access 
 
although This applies more to bussiness that hold other peoples bitcoin and give "pre-paid access" to it. not exchanging *virtual* currency.
under this guidance technically anyone "engaged as a business"  in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency." 
so what makes it a "hobby" vr a "business". no idea. Probably charging a fee isn't good, or operating in a commercial location. but selling 1pennies worth of bitcoin *as a business* is unlicensed money transmission *under this guidance*.

As a merchant you can do everything perfect. follow every rule and guideline to the tee, and still be defrauded online.

and this also tells me, the internal system of the wallet is just a debit card and chargebacks on merchants for stolen info is still a common system
accepting payment from a stolen CC on a google wallet is still going to result in a chargeback. Meaning you as a merhcant have to act as a policeman and prevent fruadlaint charges. An impossible task online.
when you use cash or bitcoin you authincate the payment instrument. Not the user like CC and google wallet. Must less risk acepting cash as a merchant then CC.

credit cards are in insure system. Dish and overstock are able to integrate bitcoin they get to take advantage of accepting payment with 0 risk of fraud. 
every year merchants loose hundreds of billions of dollars to fraud. because CC is an idenity based system. And identity is impossible to prove online. Bitcoin solves this. by verifying the coin, like cash, the merchant has 0 risk.
also, they get to do so at 0 fee's. The exact dollar amount of the items price in USD is given to them by coinbase within 24 hours in there traditional bank account.
Allowing coinbase to hold onto those coins and make money long term, or turn around and sell them to their other customers at a 1pct fee.

problem is banks have a bad habbit of shutting down everyone who attempts this. You are welcome to try. 
I used to bitinstant in the past, it was great while it lasted; yet didn't turn out too good for Charlie for trying to run this business. He is facing 30 years in prison. 
some localbitcoins guys also facing possible jail time for selling too much bitcoin.

because they are legally calling bitcoin a currency. but a different type of currency a "virtual" currency. 
 Currency vs. Virtual Currency
 FinCEN's regulations define currency (also referred to as "real" currency) as "the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that [i] is designated as legal tender and that [ii] circulates and [iii] is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance."3 In contrast to real currency, "virtual" currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. This guidance addresses "convertible" virtual currency. This type of virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency.

bittorent is a anti-fragile technology, people will continue to get their media, just like people will continue to be able to use bitcoin.

if your buying online you don't need to wait at all.
Online it is impossible to prove identity and why a lot of that CC fraud is online purchases. where bitcoin is far a superior transaction.
for in person, most large merchants use a 3rd party services like bitpay or coinbase.
Merchants that use bitpay take instant payments and all risk and liability for that is on bitpay. the merchant also has 0 tx fee's unlike CC. Leading to you as a consumer can have lower prices.
for p2p it usually just as efficient to check there is a txfee sent and accept at 0. perhaps if it was a large purchase like for a car its worth waiting the 10-15 minutes for a confirmation.

if the user doesn't know the number, It doesn't have to be spoofed as they are in the habit of giving their pin to any number that calls anyway. an attacker just needs the timing of when to call and the users number to get their pin. (assuming a user doesn't accidentally give a pin anyway if called for no reason, or under false pretenses) all they have to do is make a voice msg that sounds like you.

yea, coinbase, bitreserve, and the rest who host and control customer funds clearly fit the bill as prepaid access. (at-least the way I read it)
I would stay away from investing in any company that does this.
customers must control their own funds. that is the most powerful part of bitcoin. invest in the development of full wallets. anything else is wasted money IMHO

more products offered for bitcoin increases demand for bitcoin. more demand for bitcoin means higher prices over time as liquidity is finite.


your looking at just the people who have bitcoin, would normally save and decide they want to pay for dish. 
I would argue that there will be more people who normally use CC to pay for dish and decide to try bitcoin; puting them on the market to buy. or at the very least, people who already use bitcoin who will buy more each month to pay for dish. The idea merchant adoption is going to effect bitcoin savings i think is flawed. 
as a whole all merchant adoption increases demand. Demand is exactly what makes any currency viable.
long term steady demand, leads to tradition. Tradition leads to making the bitcoin the next gold as an incorruptible reserve currency used globally.

that is absurd. We have Money transmission laws in every state. You buy or sell bitcoin and you will get notices and closed accounts. We have not seen actual arrests and legal precedent yet (like we are in India) but if we keep going down this path just using the currency without a authentication authority is a very real possibility. Coin validation is a very real concept that a poorly guided legal system can do. Parallel currencies are not legal in the US; and we only regulate barter less than china. (who outlaws barter altogether meaning you can not accept bitcoin(or any other asset ie eggs) as payment)
we need legislation that counteracts the FinCen Guidelines and sets precedent that bitcoin is an Asset not money. And should be regulated as a security and not a currency.

Coinbase retails bitcoin like a store, like a wallmart. They buy some from exchanges, fill there shelves, and sell a product at a price they set.
bitstamp provides an open exchange to allow users to trade. by watching how there users trade they broadcast to the world what the price should be.

no, bitcoin is like cash. One there is no need to prove idenity, no risk in faud outside the authincity of the bills. (not counterfitted)
Some one accepting credit cards can follow all the rules, check for id, check the card, swipe and get approved. And **still have the transaction revoked at a later date**
that same merchant with an offline wallet can accept payment and be 100.000000000000000000000000000pct secure in knowing that payment is not going to be reversed or compromised.
and no a marchant does not have to worry about the cash being stolen when they accept cash.

An exchange connects sellers and buyers. when you buy bitcoin from bitstamp you are buying coin from some one else selling coin on bitstamp. When that order is filled the next seller steps up.
When you buy coin on coinbase you are buying directly from coinbase at a market price. the price doesn't change if your ordering 1btc, or 10,000. Coinbase floats these transactions. there are no bids, asks, spread, market depth or even trade history
and most importantly, an exchange publishes volumes and trade data. Coinbase does not.


USD does not have a blockchain. Bitstamp already posts proof of reserves of their bitcoin holdings. trying to put a usd -&gt; btc transaction on the blockchain is silly and actually dangerous as it would simply spam the network like satoshi dice does.

Im not making this up
an Exchange is defined in finance.
when you go to a currency exchanger you are using the rates set at a currency exchange (the Forex market)
if you say bitcoin is a currency then coinbase is an exchanger, they convert based on the price on the exchanges, the market. it updates to the minute just like the Forex does.
The big differnce is coinbase has 0, none, zip, nada, effect on the market rate of bitcoin. They could be selling millions or nothing for all the market cares.
Exchange's set the price of bitcoin. They are the ones who move the market. coinbase is simply a trader on the exchanges.

@_date: 2014-07-30 00:49:59
makes sense. they are just guaranteeing a rate, not that they are doing anything special with your coin. Real way to test this service is to throw a lot of coin in just before or during a large downturn. Then process a withdrawal  at a lower price. can see how much bitcoin they have set aside to cover losses.

ask your merchant if that CC purchase is instant. They can get hit with chargebacks months later. Fraud costs merchants hundreds of billions every year because of the lost merchandise and CC's don't reimburse the merchant. only take money from the merchant to give back to consumer.
Id argue as a merchant it is much safer to accept an instant bitcoin transfer at 0 confirms then it is it accept a credit card purchase.

Not many people used cars when they first came around. A lot of people had a hard time selling them even though they knew its a better technology then the horse and buggy its hard to get people to change when something is "working".
Online shopping is dominated by cc right now, because of no other option. But large merchants are the ones loosing the billions and push it back on the customer. Just because one technology is domninate doesn't mean it isn't flawed. Waste, espically as fundemental and sestemic as cc fraud will eventually get addressed.

for a currency to succeed you need demand. More merchants offering goods increases demand. Long term stable demand sets tradition. tradition lets bitcoin be the next gold.  
is gold less us-full because every central bank on the planet hoards it? in fact because every bank on the planet hoards it, citizens that hold it get a long term value store.
pretending bitcoin could be what it is, without long term holders, is simply uninformed and missing the most important part of a currency.

any system relying on proving identity is fundamentally flawed in my book. A chip and pin does not rely on identity but is not possible to implement online. 
sms as a system is not secure against spoofing. Just by knowing your number I can pretend to be it. Again not secure for proving identity. (Not to say its not usefull)
In fact there is no way to prove to me you are who you say you are online without a shadow of a doupt. so any payment system that keeps keys public (like a cc number) will never meet the needs.
Private key crypto is where all these system are going to be in the future. You sign a message with a private key you alone are responsible for keeping.

Gold as a reserve assets has been a backbone of all civilizations. Therefore modeling bitcoin after gold was the best coarse of action for long term stability. But I'm not going to say its optimal for rapid expansion.

most of the benefits are on the merchants. Coinbase process at 0pct fee's. that's the exact USD price of item in dollars sent to overstocks traditional bank account. a business that operates on a tiny margin like overstock that is huge vr the 2pct+ from CC.
there is also the 0 risk of fraud on overstock. fraud costs ***merchants*** hundreds of billions every year. (Yes I know consumers don't need to worry as they have protection, but the burden is put on merchants in lost inventory and sales, they get hit double)
consumers: pretty much only benefit is being able to purchase without giving out personal info or risk exposing there credit card info.  pay an address and done. They still have rate exposure, no protections if sent to wrong address bla bla.

you have an MTL? as far I was aware coinme out of washing was the only operator to have a money transmitter licence in the whole USA.


aml/kyc are programs the government implements on money transmitters. just because you implement the same programs as money transmitters, doesnt make you a MTL.  in fact you are doing programs that dont even apply to you yet. (as you dont have an MTL yet)

 legal tender without intrinsic value is fiat. Not all things without intrinsic value are fait currency.
Bitcoin comes into exestance through a natural process. (Computation) its creation is bounded by natural laws (mathematics) its value is derived from free trade not government laws. By definition fiat must come into exsistance by decree. 
By definition bitcoin does not fit the requirements for fiat.

an online purchase with a CC is a high risk transaction. Proving identity online is an impossible task. that is why billions are lost. No amount of insurance and consumer protection is going to make the system secure. It only mask's the true cost's from the consumer.
eventually your going to have a private key signature in every single transaction. think of this as putting a key on your money; and not keeping it all on a table in front of your house.

fraud grew as a percent of total fraud for merchants with a physical 
presence this year, from 58% in 2012 to 62% in 2013 (see figure 8). 
However, a concurrent decline in the percent of fraud attributable to lost

why on earth not? Iphone and android both have a large verity of wallet options now. really no reason on earth not to do this. and you are teaching a very very very, bad habit of sharing private keys. Private keys are to be generated and never shared. never, never, never (did I mention never share private keys?)


download one of the aforementioned wallet apps and you can see this in practice. Not only that but you can receive live payments verified correctly over the blockchain in real time. practicing all the proper requirements needed of a merchant to accept bitcoin payments large or small. (or peer to peer payments!)
if you get people into the practice of just using paper wallets your bad habbit will cost people money. Over double spending (printing out multiple wallets with the same info), or loose money by accidentally letting that private key get photographed stolen ext.
the only somewhat practical use for this may be gifting. (especially if you want to Indian give and take back the coin later if they dont use it.)    or maybe if you want to scam some one who doesn't know much about bitcoin.

guidance is not law. Money transmission is regulated by the state. Unlicensed money transmission has stiff penalty's in most states its regulated in, including California.
The federal guidance is clear-cut, buying/selling currencies as a business is money transmission. if California agrees with this guidance is just not set yet. But obviously states like Florida agree; and people are going to jail over it.
I see no difference from doing a transaction in person vr a machine, but perhaps you lawyer could tell you otherwise. and volume makes a big difference on penalty. but as a presentation given by a layer at the vegas bitcoin conference (where I got most this info). under this guidance selling even 1 pennies worth of btc in a business setting is unlicensed money transmission.
and no more then a month later I hear about that the Florida guys going to jail for the same thing.

if you read any of the due diligence forms lamassue, robocoin or skyhook makes you sign you will see them reference the finCEN guidelines released.
They make you fill this out because they know the users of their devices do not posses a MTL. the guidence clearly states any ~bussiness~ that buys or sells bitcoin is money transmission.


source 
only one of robocoins operators manged to get a MTL in the USA. coinme out of Washington state. the rest are non-compliant regardless of what bs biometrics or other evasive privacy features they try to sell you.
you have to sign the due diligence forms prior to purchase because otherwise they(Lamasue, robocoin, skyhook) could be sued for knowing you might be practicing unlicensed money transmitting and not informing you. (aka money laundering)
this is a reason the companies don't run their own units, especially in the states. There is not a lawyer worth their salt that will tell you its legal to run one of these without an MTL.

your not understanding, the block limit is not static. As mores laws increases handling larger blocks, in the gb and tb will be trivial. the 1mb limit hasn't been raised yet, because it hasn't been reached yet. The same reason having a blockchain that will turn in to petabytes and yottabytes also will be trivial to handle.
also, its worth noting, that as the block reward gets lower the economics of raising the block size increases. (the more transactions the more fee's)

right, but you as a service provider and  I as a customer have 0 ablity to verify who you are. Because you call/text me from a number I reconize doesnt mean you are actually the one doing to call/text. If I know 37coin number and I call and pretend to be you, ask for a pin... the user doesnt have a ssl tab or anything really to let him know if its safe... 
*you know a text might be safer then a call, because you need to clone a number to recieve a text. cloning a phone # is less trivial then spoof card but still mainstream. 
also, this whole medium is unencrypted. Its the akin to a website asking for your password on a webpage on http and not https
passwords do not mix with unecrypted channels.

LMFTY effectively kill Bitcoin use in NYC by legitimate companies who would not want to operate if they wert compliant. which is assuming that the regulations are impossible to follow; that is only half true.


true, but users are not. Just like torrents are invulnerable to regulation, torrent users are arrested, fined and imprisoned all the time. 


like the grandma being sued for millions for downloading half a dozen songs we would very much like to prevent that from happening.


it is, see earlier comment. 


despite the reddit goto troll comment saying that calling/emailing your representatives on things like cispa doesn't work, community outrage was exactly what postponed CISPA. 


when we got off the gold standard a lot of people said the dollar would fail because gold convertibility was lost?
or rather, did gold fail to be a good currency when it lost its convertibility to the dollar? trust is a market issue and will set convertibility accurately always, its just the rate that can spiral out of control. 
there will always be a market for bitcoin; if its trading at a fraction of a penny or millions.

well now your getting into the drama :).
So instantly Austin Hill (the at the time CEO of blockstream) went to the event under the pretext as CEO, but after everyone signed he refused to sign as CEO wanted to re-write the document as individual. 
Miners got upset at the insult, and a few of them ran bitcoin classic. The classic incident resulted the massive drama in this subbreddit. And hundreds, including myself got banned from for just mentioning classic. (I was banned for just posting a link to a block explorer and pointed out the header version was classic)
After that many of the signers including Peter Todd became extremely vocal small blockers. releasing papers and rants about how forks are end the world and ETH was a going to crash and burn because of the ETC/ETH split. Its rather Ironic that the signers turned into the most vocal small blockers. 
Luke-Jr (perhaps the most ridiculous small blocker) had outlined a bip briefly he feels upholds his obligation to the agreement. But you are right when absolutely no release or solid PR was made with 2mb of non-witness data.
So here we are today, with miners very upset over the last agreement and probally wont even sit at the table. But doesnt matter because core doesnt want to even ask them to the table and would rather pretend nothing happend and just stay in their bubbles and *sit and wait it out* on SegWit
meanwhile while they have their head in the sand BU is gaining steam and may very well get full miner support if we dont do something.

you have to figure out how you got that wrong address. where is it from? did you copy and paste it from some where else?
once you figure out where that address came from you can ask the owner for it back. there is nothing else on the earth that could possibly help you otherwise.

It's transactions are slightly bigger in general, and SegWit exposes the network up to 3.7mb of spam. it even gives it a discount on fees. 


it cant, its just a matter of how long till we do it.

Potential for up to 3.7mb of spam.

absolutely, that was already proposed by Gavin on how he would do it.
it is however contentious, atleast in my mind. there are only 3 people with access to the creds to use the system. gaven/theymos/satoshi
A proposal to fork from a keyholder is using your status as such to  influence the network. a decentralized system being dictated/forced to update, by a single user with an alert system. seems very anti-bitcoin to me. 
its also not an emergency, its a proposal.

@_date: 2014-07-07 06:01:41
every public address has a private key. When you make a new address you are adding a new keypair to your wallet. Some wallets limit how make keypairs you can make before needed to back up again so be careful. 


have a coinbase account? their is an account linking your legal name and any bitcoin that was processed by your account. Same way on other sites, there exists records of this and depending on how they retain/distribute that data can become public knowledge. Like the people who were in the MTgox database when it leaked. 


then they would see a transfer linking those two address's. As a habbit, simply use a new address every new transaction. its a general privacy rule of thumb.

naw, best time to to roll back would be a couple months into SegWit being deployed. That way there are lots of SegWit inputs to steal.

Is that "Robocoin Account" on the top of the screen held buy the atm owners or a central robocoin server?
so does that mean 1
1. you are going to publish the amount outstanding from every single one of your customers?
and if so, how do we know
1. That this is the total is accurate and other large accounts are not withheld?
2. That in the event of a compromised central service you will be insured enough to cover loss's?
And I guess the real question in all this.
what benefit does it give me to have you control my bitcoin? is it really worth going through all this effort/risk to get the instant withdrawals you are struggling with?(not waiting for confirmations)
wouldn't some kind of web-service you can presell your coin and show up and do instant withdrawal solve this?
Proof of reserves I agree are very handy **for the atm ower** so I as a customer know their really is bitcoin or cash in the atm and its not going to eat my money. (like the main tech issue that customers complain about)  
although, I understand this usually slow withdrawal from the api exchanges (like bitstamp) so this doesn't really solve that issue. (just because the atm owner has 50k in their bitstamp account, doesn't mean the withdrawal is going to happen in a timely fashion) maybe if we could see the bitcoin move from the exchange api account to the atm's wallet with a POA system verifying it before purchase could solve that.

They have yet to, doesn't mean they won't. In order to get the supermajorty they need for a fork they will have to add segwit.

And core devs here talk shit all day, every day. Its tit for tat. even in this very thread!


And in their minds its preventing people from accidentally being on the wrong side of the fork. Preventing transactions from processing is the best way to inform people they are on the wrong network.

Lighting is a simple  SIGHASH_NOINPUT 2 of 2 transaction. It has absolutely nothing to do with the type of tx's used to make those 3.7 blocks. 
Agreed. And that is mainly because large multi-sig is actually pretty common. Mostly exchanges, using cold storage. Lighting will help reduce these large tx's with channels and a few smaller multisigs to close/open them. 
2.1 - 4 is total bullshit for scaling is concerned. because anything that starts to use this much space is worthless transactions moving almost no coins. that have absolutely no use to anyone right now. And if they do find a use, its not going to be for scaling solutions.

that is the most retarded stament I have ever herd.
Credit cards are a broken system. anyone can buy millions of cc numbers online and all they have to do is spoof identity checks. its a weak system because it only has public keys (the cc number) and no private system protecting data. Chip and pin will come to the usa soon because of this.

Core refuses to define consensus. If they write any rules, any, that a Hard fork is acceptable then the Hark Forkers will strive to meet it. BU defines it as a super majority of both miners and nodes. If core thinks they have a better method to measure consensus then they can release it. They don't want to define it, because without a definition no one can meet it, and they win.


Its not a proxy, This has been going on 3 fucking years, and it cost us one of the oldest and largest contributor to the bitcoin code base. Because he saw all these problems coming and core refused to help him do something about it.
 &gt;You are asking the engineers at Lexus Motors to change a engine design that they know will cause the car to break down that greatly devalues it.
No, the founding engineer at lexus, who built all the original cars realized that part of his design was flawed. And in a few years the performance of all the cars will be limited. He tried to fix it by making a major change. Instead of the other engineers accepting it, they fought him tooth and nail, and refused to work with him on the new design. Rather then fight his coworkers he left and started a new project.


it IS a reasonable request! its so reasonable many core devs even signed a statement saying they would do it!

if you didn't preemptively flag as RBF then no, there is nothing you can do. (most wallets do not support this yet). Except wait 72hours and rebroadcast with a higher fee.
What wallet are you using? future transactions will need 180sat/byte fee to get confirmed in a reasonable amount of time now. Electrum has a nice ui to let you manually set it. 
Many wallets have low/med/high priority when they settings dont even go much higher then 100sat/byte that is way to small nowadays.

the intent of BU is only fork if miners AND full nodes are in consensus. Because segwit is over 60pct they can not fork without segwit.

Lol, if you guys try to fork to an altcoin with an insecure POW without asics you deserve to be attacked, they are doing you a favor telling you now. if it wasn't them it would be some one else.

Those against the fork got their own coin. Those who wanted it got rid of the community that didn't. I do not get your point.if there was a hard fork, and somehow the weak side survived it's not a failure of the project. It might actually be the healthiest path forward.
And for the record I was opposed to breaking immutability and would of stayed on classic if I was an eth holder.

@_date: 2017-02-06 05:36:21
Classic was focused on full nodes, and they were able to get 3+ thousands. But it failed and core just said its not a good benchmark, mining power is. Now they are claiming its just a 51pct attack. But after they get the mining power, then starts to node race and getting people to upgrade. And if they get enough core nodes to turn off and switch to BU then its time to fork.


Miners would be willing to burn thousands of BTC for the comfort  knowing that bitcoin can scale and they will be able to collect more fees as the mining rewards keep dwindling.
1 block reward is nothing compared to how much potential revenue they have been loosing with the fixed block size.

is moving less then 500 transactions. Its totally worthless for scaling. Only really complex 15 of 15 multisig that doesn't have any application besides to make spam and bloat the chain. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:55:52
right, BTC withdrawals were off and on. But fiat was strait down for the last almost 6 months of gox. So people who had a lot of money on gox would BUY bitcoin in an attempt to withdrawal funds.

Is a symptom of the unhealthy us vr them environment of the community in general. Many in BU know that if they wish to get to the super majority of nodes and miners they are looking for they will have to add SegWit. (It the community keeps demanding it)
miners who signed the HK agreement agreed to segwit. and were not opposed.


Is why its inevitable the BU adds it, or BU fades and becomes irrelevant. 
However the realist in me makes me think it will be awhile before it actually happens especially if SegWit continues to have minimal miner support. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 23:42:05

A single repo does not control Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a community. It can move away from a minority. We see it over and over in the altcoin space. Stop saying something is impossible because your just making them more motivated to prove you wrong and do it anyway.
it's dangerous, and maybe not what's best for everyone, but not impossible.

I agree with this. They are attempting something very difficult and don't have the proper resources.


You have no evidence (I think) that these nodes don't validate all the rules (at least as a BU client)
Perhaps if you don't like their definition  of consensus you help them find a better metric. 
I would like to see signaling built into tx's. You could see what percentage of people actually using Bitcoin want bigger blocks. Or perhaps a way to vote based on holdings that doesn't count non voters as a vote to stay. Anything that attempts to define economic actors in Bitcoin.

In the current fee model I agree 100pct with you. But with SegWit you can build txs that intentionally have huge witness data and almost no blockweight. There is no known use for these transactions. The only function they have is to be large and bloat. (Or to look cool on testnet with 3.7mb blocks) but they move almost 0 coin. And with the blockweight model they get a massive discount on fee cost. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 08:19:25

this is totally not true. with the size and scope of DDOS's that hit exchanges and services regularly now that is not practical. 
you throw a lambda stack at a ddos and your going to do nothing but drain all the funds in your account ten of thousands of dollars a second. 
AWS does have products you can purchase.
You can not *scale* out of a ddos, you need real time analitics and proper firewall rules and proper server permeation globally to determine the source to manage and mitigate the attack.
 Coinbase, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Kacken, Bitstamp, Blockchain.info. every single large provider that is a affected by DDOS use cloudflare. They are simply the best in the industry. There are competitors. And some of them do so without needed to hand over your keys. But I would never recomend anyone running any kind of sizable service attempt to do roll their own without multi-million dollar budgets. And honestly I don't know enough about their competitors to even recommend an alternative.

BU is a dynamic blocksize limit. Meaning they can collect revenue on hundreds of millions of users tx fees. With a 1mb artificially limited supply they can only collect fees on a few thousand tx's. 
Imagine you sell coffee. Would a starbucks that can only sell 100 cups a coffee an hour ever become profitable? even if you tried to charge 100$ a cup? miners need to increase supply to raise revenue.

In fact it sounded like Lawski wanted to at least lower the financial barriers to entry in NYC for the bitlicence; but people were dreaming if they thought he could go lenient on anything else.

right, but the amount witness is low as they are very simple multisig and they still move coins like a normal transaction and need non-witness data for that. And are limited by the 1mb limit.  3mb is not possible with LN tx's. Only very crazy complicated scripts not really useful for anything txs can use 2.1+ and that is only if they are 100pct of the block.
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:00:16


I said attempts to count nodes*. They are trying to define something that core refuses to define. its not the intention to allow miners to set blocksize. 
 The main issue is no one here can come up with a definition of consensus. Majority of miners is a 51pct attack. Majority of nodes is a sybil attack. Signing statements like Classic had exchanges and merchants do don't matter because (its not the network bro). And the Hong Kong agreement just got thrown out the window.
I'm not a BU supporter, I am not attempting to supporting BU in my posts. I'm sympathetic to their intentions. and it drives me crazy when this sub lies and attacks people like Gavin and Peter_R when they are great devs and truly attempting to better bitcoin. And what this should be is a debate of ideas not people. But we are not allowed to debate here if its *pro one side.

First of all nothing will break. You can still send a standard transaction and receive a standard transaction. Where you are getting confused is you will not be able to generate a segWit address (p2sh will start with a 3 like multi-sig) so any sigWit wallet user would need to select a standard tx to send to you. (until your wallet provider upgrades to support sigWit)

artificially limiting the supply of the miners product is central economic planning. the fed manipulates money supply. Very different concepts. The goal of BU is not for miners to control anything. Its goal is define a consensus mechanism where both users (full nodes) and miners can agree to changes together.

You don't use it "with" Coinbase. And coinbase is not a wallet. They are a custodian. You are giving them all your Bitcoin and asking for it back when you need to send.
Ledger IS a real wallet. So you purchase Bitcoin on coinbase and transfer it to the ledger when available. You can use your ledger anytime you need to send.

its gibberish, fake op_code madness to just create bloat!
a normal block moves 2,500 transaction. and thats only 1MB
I don't know how to put it any other way. LN transactions are still limited by non witness data. and will not result in blocks bigger then 2.1mb. LN tx's are small multisigs.
And any block that does result in greater then 2.1 is moving less coin then a normal block today.

your totally not understanding the situation. A softfork is only safe if miners reach overwhelming consensus.  Attempting a softfork when miners using segwit are a minority will be disastrous.


Right in the fucking article. If miners cant verify segwit they could accept a chain with invalid SegWit tx's. causing a hard fork. And only the minority of miners enforcing segwit would reject that chain. breaking SPV.

Saying you will do something, then turning around and leading that charge against it is a total betrayal to the agreement. Not only did none of the code for the forks ever get committed for any kind of legitimate release. but many of the signers are the most vocal small blockers in the space.


If you ask the miners the agreement was originally breached by the Austin Hill at the time trying to change his signature and getting people to resign. 
But the finger pointing and both sides looking for excuses to get out of commitments is a perfect example why our entire community is dysfunctional.

citation needed. I disagree with this 1000pct. Many examples in the space have shown that a miner super-majority and a basic majority of a dev community can hard fork safely.


I disagree, you want them to move faster then they are. The vast majority of miners are not doing anything antagonistic. Only a small minority are signaling BU. 
 congested blocks are not the miners fault. Its the devs for not fixing it in time. 


When being forced to upgrade agienst their will is denial of access.

You still need a 3rd party. And its almost impossible to prove you actually sent the right item. People on openBazaar have been know to fool the escrow agents by shipping bricks to customers. They have valid tracking, valid weights.  Agents can look and research on the shipping provider that *item was shipped.
And the same for the receiver. Hard to prove the sender swapped it for a brick and not the receiver that swapped it wanting to contest and get his money back. 
Its all human interactions and not perfect.

miner* singular. That is why I started my example with "if I owned a small mining pool"
The pool only needs to mine 1 block. just 1, and they potentially steal all the SegWit bitcoin.


Is impossible to prove, and why this discussion is only in relation to UASF.


yea they should support it and signal it, and wait for activation. Like was originally planned. I do NOT think its safe for a miner to accept these TX's before enough signalling because it is dangerous to both user and themselves! (if they are in the minority they are on the wrong side of a fork, they lost rewards)


No one is calling for that, not even BU. Everyone here is looking for user signaling. And i'm all for defining that. we need that for a HF as well.

If miners stay non SegWit and a theft tx is broadcasted by anyone in a block Miners can not verify it. This will cause a hard fork and SegWit is the altcoin and old nodes the old Bitcoin.
Longest valid chain. To old nodes both chains are valid. And theft side is longer.

@_date: 2017-03-14 18:46:20
????? wow.
Ok, so blocks are full. and miners are limited to 1mb of tx's per block. Why would a miner that has a choice of 60 MEG's of high fees choose low fees??????
As long as the mempool is packed, and the blocksize remains 1mb, fees will continue to rise as userbase rises. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:46:06


is the whole point. Old nodes follow the longest VALID chain. In this example both chains are valid to old nodes, and if a minority of miners are on SegWit, the LONGEST valid is the theft chain. 
This is clearly a HARD fork. And most importantly, by original rules the theft chain is the OLD side of the fork. ie the new fork coin is segwit


Good, so wait for them to upgrade THEN activate SegWIt.


Its unreasonable that they are FORCED to upgrade or potentially face huge monetary loss mining on "THE ORIGINAL RULES OF BITCOIN"


There is no way to signal this without listening to miners. 


Its not opt-in that is the whole point. And exchanges, services, users and miners that fail to upgrade to segwit are IN DANGER OF FINANCIAL LOSS&gt; 
All because you want to invent a way to signal that has tons sybill attack vectors, and enforce rules the miners are incapable of enforcing yet. Because you cant wait, or come up with a better option to scale. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:17:08

Because they know if they tried to steal that all the MINERS would orphan that block and not mine on it. Causing huge financial loss to the miner that made it!

It's not inferior, it's totally unrelated. And it's not a solution. They are both strategies to scale and they don't compete with eachother. The hold up in SegWit is about 3 years of neglect and abuse by the core devs on the miners. Not a judgement on the tech.

More then one strategy to a problem; and putting all your eggs into an unproven technology is dangerous.


NO, those are the biggest RISKS to bitcoin. So far those risks have not hurt us.


On what planet do you live.


Nor are miners and users.


Then why do you spend so much time attacking them? Whats killing bitcoin is the amount of drama surrounding a centralized monolithic development processes that gives total control of the network to a single github repo and therefore a single development group; and when it comes down to it, veto power by you.
I'm not saying the path forward is BU. But stop pretending like this problem was not predicted. Stop pretending there is no solutions because there are many. Stop saying blocks are too big because no one believes you and it just kills your credibility. Our biggest problem right now is we cant grow, we cant properly service our current community. I dont know what the solution is, but it does not seem to be coming out the bitcoin/bitcoin github, after the last 3 years that has become very evident.

I think the only consensus I've heard is that we need to be able to support an extremely large payment network. and its common sense we want fees to be low.
Letting core pick some hard numbers they think they can reach is important. and so is keeping the table open to how they will do it. 
the main complaint I keep hearing is core WANTs low volume of tx's and high fee's. I don't think that's true. But if it is, and they refuse to commit to improving it, then its time to fork and id join classics vision.

Hard forks are dangerous for everyone. Old nodes would be on the non SegWit side of the fork. This is exactly the reason why a big block hard fork was avoided. This is some hypocritical madness here.

Not supporting something you don't agree with/support is not obstructionism, it is not bowing down to the force of others. 


No, It will be the segwit nodes rejecting valid blocks causing the hark fork. You are using the threat of destruction of ones property by invalidating non segwit mined blocks to force them to upgrade.
I don't understand what is going on with this community. This power struggle is just going to destroy what people have spent so much time money and effort to build. 
The HK agreement was compromise on both sides. Why cant you just follow it in good faith and we can move forward. Flag segwit AND 2mb blocks for July 2017.

I don't think any hard fork will ever not be contentious. The issue is lets define consensus and decide when we can leave the ideological extremists behind and improve our community and technology.

is being currently discussed all over this sub now. And I went into detail in this case originally in this example here.


Is the whole point, and non segwit miners CAN NOT detect this and protect from it without upgrading. 


Is not true, as all miners enforce bip66. THE WHOLE FUCKING POINT.

Personally I'm with you, and would ideologically of stayed on classic. as the reversion was theft.
However, when users and devs do not agree philosophically, being forced to work together is toxic to both sides. 
Letting them split was the healthiest path forward for both sides.
 &gt;People lost* money in the split. 
If they lost money from the valuation they were being propped up by a community that was opposed to them in the first place. Better both stay on relatively compatible coins and can share dev work then just leave the project.

Right, that's the point, non SegWit nodes can not reject the invalid block.
Old miners can't verify SegWit txs. So they will mine the longest chain. Even if it has a theft tx in it. Old nodes will follow that that chain because both are valid and one is longer.

Yes but is has NOT always viewed blocks &gt; 1mb as invalid.


It also would not be secure WITHOUT miners.


yes so don't break them with things like UASF. where miners are INCAPABLE of protecting without upgrading.


Full Nodes are also centralized. when considering userbase vr nodecount. We need to fix this. And no, I don't agree bandwith is what is hurting this count. As other coins get higher node counts with higher bandwith requirements. 


In Satoshi's mind there was no difference between a miners and full nodes.  The whole concept was lost and your reaching trying to put words in his mouth otherwise. Miners have to mine valid blocks or they get punished financially BY OTHER MINERS. full nodes rejecting is an edge case logic Satoshi was never brainstorming.  
The idea nodes can fork away with things like UASF where 2 chains are both valid to old nodes, and one chain is invalid to a minority IS a hard fork. And is just as dangerous without any of the benefits of a 2mb fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:20:02
Non SegWit miners can not validate SegWit transactions. When you have a majority of miners incapable of enforcing the rules any violation of that rule would result in a hard fork. 
For example. Say I had a small mining pool. If I included a transaction spending all SegWit inputs on the network to myself. That would still look like a valid transaction to non segwit miners and nodes. If non segwit miners are the majority they WILL follow that chain.  Because to those miners it is the longest VALID chain. SegWit miners and nodes will be forked off the network and be on "segwit coin"
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:07:37

The miners who ran classic were pissed Austin Hill refused to sign the agreement as president of blockstream. Even after going into the meeting under that title. Requesting it be changed to individual. AFTER everyone else signed.
The day after he refused to sign they ran classic. 


Have you even read my post? This is not court, I'm not arguing anyone violated it. I'm saying the spirit was for whats best for bitcoin. And both sides are failing to work towards that goal. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:50:02
There is no metric to measure "users" that cant be attacked via sybil. Therefore any method that is not enforced by the miners will fail.  


Miners wont upgrade, and theft tx's will be broadcast to miners who don't understand segwit and included. This will completely destroy the SPV model. 
This whole thing is so reckless. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:48:49

perhaps they half assed enough to meet the terms* but they are not following the INTENT of it. the intent was to stop this division and work together for this goal. Going off and becoming the loudest voices against a hard fork is not adhering to the spirit of the agreement. 


Miners would say that it was core, (specifically Austin Hill) who refused to sign the document as president. as it was the day after that refusal they ran classic.
But that is not what im getting at. The spirit of the agreement was cooperation, and trying to avoid what is going on right now.
Now we have BU approaching 40pct mining power. SegWit (something both sides of the agreement wanted) at 25ish. and a bunch of people soo pissed off they feel a network split is the only solution.

This UASF is forcing miners to upgrade, or potentially be left on the stale old side of a fork. And because there is no way for users to vote that is sybil protected it is allowing a minority fake votes and force a change. A change into the network that WILL result in a hard fork if miners do not upgrade to SegWit. 
I want SegWIt too, but we need to use a carrot, not a stick.

If a single miner included a malicious tx then all the non SegWit nodes and miners will be on the "old" side of a hard fork. As SegWit nodes will be on a smaller chain after rejecting the theft block.
Miners have no choice to upgrade or potentially be left of the old side of a fork.

any SPV node that connects to non segwit nodes could be double spent. even with x number blocks.

@_date: 2017-03-09 21:55:39
BU is not meant to fork until it gets a super majority of both nodes AND miners. Therefore a reorg is not generally a major issue. 
However reorg + replay protection is really something to consider. Especially for exchanges like coinbase that lost a ton of money by ignoring warnings of this for ETC.

@_date: 2017-03-13 16:23:33
Every single major exchange will support both. I know, because they are already building systems to do this. From what Ive read the majority will assign it BTU while the marketcap is lower. And will restore it to BTC if its the majority. Many industries have signed letters pledging to support bigger blocks including coinbase and bitpay. that comes back from classic. You keep pretending that users and hodlers are not for bigger blocks but you are wrong.
And the main example i'm talking about is the ETH ETC successful split. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:43:58
I don't get the reasoning behind locking the coins. Large hodlers can sign and the vote tally should just keep track of addresses and only count those still holding coin.

Most people agree that the blocksize should not be *unlimited. But 1mb is just not cutting it. Many came together and agreed in the past that 2mb of non witness data was a good compromise. including some core devs and all the major miners[.]( 
So yes, I think if core released code for that kind of HF with a flag day, this whole debate will wind down and people would work together to that goal. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:36:57
I'm not. Longest valid chain. To old nodes both are valid. And if the majority of miners are non SegWit it would be disastrous.

its untested, incomplete and has no one working it. and is not being supported BY CORE ITSELF.


This is NOT being met, there is no continued work..


Because 2mb of non witness data is what was agreed by BOTH CORE AND MINERS AS BEING SAFE.


No I think the engineers should of brought up those dangers when they scoped out their work orginally. And if they cant meet the objectives they need to go back to the table and figure it out with the management. 


This is not a court of law. It doesn't matter if its valid. The intent of the agreement was what is best for bitcoin. Its still what is best for bitcoin. If we want to change the path lets get back to the table and do it together. 


It doesn't matter what country the miners are from. They are all peers. Right now china is being better bitcoiners then the rest of the world. The problem isn't them being good at mining, its us failing to be better. 
Miners keep us secure. They are what keeps bitcoin what it is. We can not dump the miners, they are as important to us as we are to them.


Shows that you clearly don't understand what POW is. They dont order tx's, they SECURE THE WHOLE FUCKING NETWORK FROM ATTACKERS.

They will still get paid, but your minority network will loose the miners and you officially hard forked. 
Under the rules of bitcoin non segwit miners are still mining VALID blocks. And bitcoin is the largest VALID chain. So you are forking non-segwit nodes off the network forcefully and making yourself an altcoin supported by only segwit nodes and a minority of miners. 
This is a bad BIP. NACK

That is a lie. Everyone propagates valid blocks. Even with a SegWit theft.
It's not "miners" it's any single miner who finds a block can do it. And the rest can't verify.
Old nodes will be on old Bitcoin. And they will be on the non altcoin side of the fork.

its a start. And should be done, if everyone agrees its safe. But things are not done. even with 100pct participation on it right now it wouldn't even bring tx fee levels back down to pre-2014 levels. (ie sub 5cents)
I don't think this argument will ever be done till we get a dynamic blocksize. My personal thoughts is it should be dynamically adjust based on fee's not just fullness of blocks. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:19:43

if they didn't agree to it they should never of signed. If they changed their mind they should of gone back to the table.

ah true I was confusing myself, but actually 2016 blocks will come much slower then two week unless mining goes back to normal levels. I meant it will never be less then two weeks unless mining increases from current levels. 
fees are historically high for bitcoin. and comparing to CC is apples to oranges.

bad use of words. yes I meant the needing to lock a larger amount of funds in order to send a smaller amount. This is very obvious limitation when lighting network comes into play as an exchange needing high liquidity would need to be a part of the network holding extremely high amounts also locked just to participate.

bullshit; bitcoin was founded out of the 2008 financial collapse. Satoshi himself mentions that is why he built it. the average user might not be able to quote Rothbard but they know what honest money means. They might not be economists but they know what the fed is doing now is the same as it was before 2008, and it is dangerous. They know that year after year their money can buy less and less groceries. And they don't give a fuck what the modified CPI says; they cant feed their family anymore with 100$.


tell me the title of Satoshi's whitepaper and you will prove yourself wrong.


the only nonsense i'm hearing is that market volatility is whats destroying us and bitcoin was never meant to be cash. Both of which are wrong. The real danger is the bitcoin community accepting mediocrity we have now and not evolving to support the future communities. Im more concerned with the dangers of not dealing with scaling issues and the market moving away into altcoins then some silly merchants dropping accepting btc because of volatility.

Every major machine learning or research institute has GPU farms. Hashing is even considered a weapon by the US government and is regulated. When Sony releasedThe ps3 they had to go through a ton of beurcarcy to even export


What I'm saying as a rough estimate 90pct of all general, non-asic  hashing power on the planet is not in private hands. Ignorant to think no government agency or private company won't bite. Bitcoin is only secure Because to acquire the hardware would be more expensive then the potential gain. Power means very little.

question is there a singular internet? or would you correct some one referring to "the" internet and not the Internets?
because that is what you are doing with this comparison. Different countries are configured differently and what many consider the internet is very different from the next.
depending on how you configure your bitcoin client you can reach many more transactions. Depending on your isp you can reach many more Internets.
While factually true; if you tried to correct some one and say its "the Internets" they would just call you an asshole and walk away.

wrote a long comment about how top tier. .0009btc/kb tx's sometimes don't even get in the next block during really bad congestion. And how being around exchanges I see many many people who payed .0005+ miss blocks very commonly.
However, no matter how I put it; that is a fee market. so instead I changed my comment.
The problem with market fee's is people have no idea what they need to pay a fee for bitcoin to work as they expect. If we want people to use bitcoin they need to know how to use it. Until we can stabilize price discovery; and allow stability in day to day; bitcoin is not going to work as people expect. in my mind that is broke; however I might be in the minority.
so I changed my comment to "going rate"

Without ASIC's you instantly loose the mining game to private and government entities. A single GPU farm owned by Google could turn on and game over; all value lost. A single supercomputer owned by any single nation could click on and game over. All the privately owned GPU's on the planet are peanuts on the computing global scale.
Bitcoin only survived because pre-asic we didn't need to secure billions like we do today. Trust has to be earned; and is only proportional to security. Nowadays we throw away more sha256 hashing power every year from obsolescence then every single privately owned silicon chip working together on the planet could produce.

This is true.  But like all important decisions there is no perfect solution. Hardware requirements are hard on operators, yet they are currently low; currently a 30$ rpi and 15$ a month lowest tier comcast internet can be a full node. even claims to be able to run a full node on his nexus phone.  Optimizing and doing more with what we have is a no brainier. No one is saying in theory sigwit is a bad idea. The problem is even with that increase we are still far from scaling to meet the needs of the network in the short-mid term. much less be able to keep fees reasonable next year. Or keep users from missing block confirmations in high congestion even right now. sigwit is not enough to last until any other large scaling solutions are found without doing major damage. People on the other side of this debate feel that the risks of congestion, high fee's, and instability far outweigh the risks of increased demand on full node operators or the dangers of a forced update.
If we continue to refuse to allow hard forks to address the long term needs to of the project; other projects will fill the void.
an intelligent network would adept to the needs to guarantee growth. it would be much better for discussion to talk about how many other problems can we solve at the same time as a hard fork implementing dynamic block limits. Not only trying to get as many needed features in now but looking for potential future needs that can be addressed preemptively. Pretending bitcoin could service the entire growing community the next decade without a fork is a mistake; and many many people are starting to see that.    
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:21:51
Your totally giving up on satoshi's vision. Because it's "too hard". Things worth doing are not easy. Being digital cash is hard, but making room to grow the community is absolutely necessary. We are buying time and making great progress with segwit. The pressure forced us to make txs extremely efficient. By adding a carefully planned dynamic block size algo in the next year or so we can solve the issue for generations.

all the mempools are connected. they are all on the same network. Like the internet. But depending on how you configure it you reach a different amount of content. 
If you were in china, and you could reach some stuff we can here in the USA; however most other content is blocked. and you can reach networks not available outside of china. is that the same internet?
most mempools have the same tx's. However, depending on how its configured its more/less then the rest. But most people have access's to x tx's so they refer to it as "the mempool" just like we refer to the internet worldwide.

No their* logic is they feel they know whats best for bitcoin. They wanted to core to get on board years ago. Core lied and said they would get on board (the Hong Kong agreement). But didnt, and didn't apologize. Nor did they even attempt to do what they signed and stated they would do. In their mind they have no honor. 
So they have no respect for core; And now Core is wanting something from them. In fact many in this sub are demanding something from them. Without offering any apologies for lieing years ago, and without even asking them very nice. 
In fact many in this sub disrespect the miners on a daily basis. They have no respect for the money, time and effort they have put into bitcoin. And say ignorant things like (we'll just change POW and fire all the miners). When anyone who has even a slightest intelligence into what bitcoin is knows that would completely destroy bitcoin. 
So try to put yourself in some one else's shoes and see how your behavior looks.

2x is not going to kill anything if it has consensus.
and what is killing the golden goose now is congestion and fees. Businesses have seen this coming and been fighting it for years. users fighting it clog up support ques. (with some ques getting 2-3 thousands tickets on unconfirmed txs a day) they struggle with liquidity. they struggle with overhead costs of maintaining liquidity. they struggle with slow transactions and a growing problem with UX in bitcoin as a whole is limiting adoption and expansion of their business.
right now bitcoin is like this turtle
if we dont do anything it will die. We can keep growing around the bottleneck with segwit2x but that is only going to last short term. bitcoin will reach max capacity and growth in the cryptosphere will continue to leave bitcoin and go into alts. layer2 solutions are not a magic bullet, have limitations, and will be slow to catch the firehose of new users entering bitcoin every day.

That might be the current result, but not the intent. The intent is nodes signal to miners what they will accept.

this *"China is ruining Bitcoin" is so fucking wrong. We should be thanking them for building so much infrastructure. 
They are securing the network. We all benefit from it. The problem is NOT that they are centralizing. The problem is the rest of the world is failing to pull their own weight and do something about it. this china government subsides power bla bla is just a bunch of excuses. 
And while the majority of volumes numbers are faked and manipulated coming out of china. There is large demand and that doesn't hurt anything in fact we are all profiting from it.
I know the firewall makes competing with china hard now, but that is only if the Marjory of mining power is in china. If we were able to compete their shitty internet would be a disadvantage, the way it is supposed to be.

@_date: 2017-01-09 18:02:10
then why does core spend so much time attacking alternative implementations? Why do core devs fly to china to beg miners not to run any other code? why does core use the git repo to make political statements like removing Gavin from it? Why does core continue to reject all bips that have anything to do with big blocks, or way to measure consensus?
Having a single repo makes the network weaker because if there ever is a critical bug the entire Mono culture of the network can die. And core doesnt have a flawless record. Bugs that print billions of coins. Unexpected hard forks with rollbacks. Diversity is how nature strengthens large networks like this. So if there ever is a mistake the entire network doesnt die.

I don't get why you are trying so hard to drive a wedge in the community. If there is no support for 2mb of non witness data fine. Let a bip be written and let it fail.
Refusing to do this is just forcing more people into other implementations.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:12:37
Im talking all the way back to 3 years ago when Gavin and others proposed bip100 101 and 102. 
It was the inability to properly handle, not necessarily technical, issues (like a hard fork) in the bip process, and the ensuing drama in the bip processes is what birthed XT. 
But yes, I agree we need to come back together and work and organize bips even between alternative implementations. and do agree with merging buip and the bip process.

 1. that timeframe is much less dramatic of a change. 8.6 - 10.6 is 2. while the the other was 2.8. close to a 30pct difference.
And your not factoring in the 20$ drop in price. Leading to natural spike in transactions.  The price was flat on the 7th-8th. 
And showing the mempool climb by itself is worthless stat. He is not showing any proof of anything malicious. The burden of proof is on you to prove its not natural.

common ground great,
however maybe i'm wrong, But based on my observations then you and I might be a minority in this sub. 


payment channels and lightning are great and extremely useful innovations, however they are far from an convenient as cash. requiring funds to be put in escrow ext. and should not be thought of as a replacement but a complement. 


more common ground.


in general I totally agree, but as a network eventually its evolve or die. Not that we are anywhere close to that now. But eventually those who refuse are going to get left behind. It is just how life is.  
I just want to see 1. people admit the a hard fork could be done reasonably safely. and eventually we will need to do it. so lets figure out how to make the most out of it.

your forgetting the difficulty adjustment time. For two weeks+ (2016 blocks) the difficulty will remain the same, yet mining will be less. If this happens then blocktimes are going to slow WAYYYY down. as block-time goes down capacity goes down. blocks could be multiple hours before discovery and if current tx volume remains constant blocks will not be able to handle it.

Getting USD in/out of China is hard. So if there are  not enough Bitcoin sellers in China this allows the price to raise. And if not enough liquidity exists between markets you get what we are seeing.
Also the volume of most China exchanges is faked. So it's hard to get a real grasp on how much is really being traded at that inflated price.
As bank wires start to flow arbitrageurs will clear up the difference. But wires are generally 7 days.

While I share your totally distrusting nature in everything that is the US financial system. I feel your frustration is completely in the wrong place on this one.
Coinbase is a company that cozied up to to the system because in order to serve the the bitcoin community they needed too.  Almost every single one, on thousands and thousands of people/companies that tried to sell bitcoin is the USA failed. They all failed because the legal system here is built to make them fail. The only company that has manged to sell bitcoin here without getting shut down, forced to charge ridiculous fee's, or had its operators thrown in jail is coinbase.
They are a US finance company. they don't pretend to be otherwise, they don't advertise themselves as otherwise. They are as intrusive and as corperate as any bank, because to move hundreds of millions of dollars through the US finical system they need to. And this liquidity the the absolute most important asset the bitcoin network needs. its what new users need, and even when long time bitcoin people like me need to move 6 figures in and out of banks legally for bussiness. And most important they don't meddle in the affairs of core devs. They mind their own business and only make statements as a user of bitcoin. 
Now, this is a complete contrast from the AXA and blockstream is doing. They do not advertise they are corporate. For as far as we know they provide no service for bitcoin outside of liquid a closed source proprietary product. Who does not explain the intent of buying of every core dev they can find. Whos motives and intent with bitcoin is completely unknown. (and I think even unknown to those running the company.) If core devs just needed money, companies should of raised money for grants. Putting them into legal arrangements with investors, and investors tied to Goldman Sachs, the worst of the worst of all wall street, is probably in my mind the biggest red flag and horrible precedent set in bitcoin. Why would AXA want ties with bitcoin development? why is it worth hundreds of millions of their dollars? at what point does their totally corrupt business practices and just overall evil nature start to change blockstream into something evil. 
 
TL:DR  Coinbase turned to the devil for the greater good. Blockstream accepted the devils money simply for greed.

If I had to guess; it looks like there is a bug where the backend is thinking he is attempting to send 0 bitcoin. And therefore hitting the dust error incorrectly (as 0.00238 is 238000 statoshi much &gt; the the 543 dust limit). Hard to tell if that is a webview or bc.i's app. But most likely there is an UI error and is forming the request incorrectly. This is a bug and you can report it to them.
as some one who, when I first started in bitcoin, tried to build a service on BC.i's API, I know first hand that they probably have one of the worst engineering records out there on bitcoin services and would not recommend its products to people.

@_date: 2017-08-20 18:40:06
Please inform yourself. The 3.7mb blocks you speak of are purely academic, and do not translate to increased capacity.
Only moves 500txs. So an 8mb would only move 1000. And a current 1mb block without SegWit moves 2300+.
SegWit is a .8mb increase in potential capacity. And anything above that is from witness heavy multi-sig transactions. A 1.8mb block of simple txs will move more UXTOs then a 2.3 estimated on current mix of multi-sig. 
So no, we are not at 4x increased capacity with just SegWit.

It is the only way to buy BTC from within the banking system, inside of the USA. period, end of story. That is absolutely 100pct true.
You simply can not attach yourself to the ACH and or Credit systems in the USA without hundreds of millions to spend on legal departments. its completely a rigged cronyism system. And has been long before bitcoin. 


Is breaking the laws in the USA. so is localbitcoins. They are only able to function because its the users that go to jail using it, not the operators of the site. its users have already been put in jail, and there is legal precident to arrest the users of those services with jail terms on paper of 10-20years+ for unlicensed money transmission. 
And while these gray areas are essential to growing bitcoin. It is not as much of an asset to our network right now compaired to a 100pct legal, ready to partner with mega-corporations system like coinbase is (and bitpay).
You could not get Steem moving tens of millions of dollars through bitsquare. Its just not possible.

it really is not, if anything it's much safer because of the opt-in. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:05:26


That is not true. Any user can run SPV and listen to the network themselves with no 3rd parties. Bitcoins security model isn't based on every user running a full node. as most users never need to. For instance a consumer/spender can trust a SPV node as its not a risk to them to spend, only the receiver. It is only merchants and services that need to validate securely large amounts of transactions. 
It is also a fallacy to think bandwidth is the reason node count is low now. The more users we get using bitcoin the more merchants will exist to service them, the more capital available to run more nodes.

@_date: 2017-08-22 21:42:33


there has been 0 cases of a miner ever censoring a transaction in bitcoin. 0. none, never has it happend. Long may it stay that way. 


I have never once argued against segwit. and my concerns with UASF were from the dangers of a chain split. UASFers had a ton in common with big blockers and I pointed that out. in both cases we feel the risks are worth the reward. However IMHO, UASF was the same risks but much less rewards. 
and this is totally off topic. The goal is censorship resistant money.  the secondary goal is censorship resistant money for the world*. It is asics that protect the first, scaling is related to second.

uh..... 2mb of non witness data, results in blocks *No larger than 4mb.
That is right in the Hong Kong agreement; word for word. It was agreed upon by many experts.
so lets review their chart
16gigs of ram. But also notice that little 1* reference.
(Approximate value to keep the same transaction processing time.) 
This means systems with less RAM are still viable but would simply process transactions with delays! But this is not something that would render a node useless.
 the time is approximate, but the delays were talking about are milliseconds. A miner might need the full 16gigs, but a Rpi would be fine for normal payments. (as a merchant should be waiting for 1confirm anyway! 10+-min)
And here is where pipes in shouting. *BUT YOU ARE JUST MAKING THOSE NUMBERS UP!
and I point to the next column, 


so if you want to spend less then 20$ on ram, you can just process your blocks a couple ms slower.
now for the important part.


Is a lot, I admit. While trivial for any commercial line. technically that is 1.6tb a month. And in some places comcast caps at 1tb.
But lets look at where these stats came from.
This is taking metrics from a SINGLE full node! this whole doc referencing one client and one configuration!
And if you look at this node (IT HAS 124 PEERS! the MAX allowed!) a ridiculous amount of traffic, and absolutely totally skewed metric if your looking for *Minimum requirements for a full node!!!!!
And looking more into this site, this ubuntu server is hosted in AWS.
In reality 90+pct of people do not host on a low end home internet connection.
But if they did, and connected to 100+ peers, they might run into the monthly cap as some states have at 1tb. 
That is assuming EVERY SINGLE BLOCK MINED! is at 4mb.
And the majority of home full nodes do not run 24/7. As most people shut off their computers at night. 
Developers/home users are not the the best target when it comes to decentralization and full node maintainers.
They have no economic incentive to maintain them long term.
But those users can simply limit their peers! and even target their traffic usage!
The report is well written. However,


Is just not founded in reality. Reality is most nodes are hosted in cloud service providers. And bandwidth for them is basically unlimited.
And while I reject the premise that this is bad in the first place. hosting nodes is still ownership! and much much much more censorship resistant then home internet ISP's that get shut down and censored all the time. 
Decentralization comes from total node count, the geographical and *hardness of the hosting. More nodes hosted in more datacenters worldwide is not a loss on decentralization. When objectivly looking at what kind of nodes survive and stay consistent on the network long term it's hosted services.
A true survey on full nodes would show this. Not some steam survey that people are describing their home computers on. 
And the real numbers that would be interesting is historical full nodes on bitcoin vr prevalence of software like electrum, and SPV nodes. I would bet you would see massive drop offs in full nodes as that software becomes more widely used. And overall numbers grow the more hosted services get brought online as merchants/businesses need them.
But anyway. 
This is much better discussions then.

what nodes?
When bitcoin classic almost reached the core node count did that change anything? (no)
nodes don't mean shit. they are needed to run the network but they cant be used to measure consensus.  
consensus rules are defined by a community, and when the community decides to change them they can. The old coin dies and the new one is made.
When ETH dev's moved on to a new coin they kept the name, because they were the larger group and there was consensus to do so. 
if segwit2x has consensus it will keep the name bitcoin. And the minority that decided to stay on the old chain will continue to live on like ETC. They can call themselves what they want, but consensus will say they are not bitcoin, and will have a hard time convincing exchanges to listen to them saying otherwise.

This is basic economics. Yes we want prices to stay high. Yes we want prices high enough to limit transactions to only strong economic activity. But you do NOT do that by limiting supply. You use price discovery and let the market determine what supply will reach peak revenue.  
And no, if you raised the price all the way to 25$ demand will decrease and you will not sell 10 an hour. And what are you going to do, tell people who came in for that coffee they need to wait an hour till you will sell to them? Its clearly horrible business practice.

no, it is a factor of barrier of entry of a malicious actor. 


back then a single days worth of production from Intel or other chip fab could produce the the same amount of power of the bitcoin network. Making it trivial for a government to take over bitcoin. Luckily ASICS have been growing exponentially since. 


and you are a fool; and do not understand bitcoins security model. The lower the barrier to entry the more bad actors will be temped to come in and destroy you. 
bitcoin started small enough there wasn't enough reward to censoring transactions, or double spending economic actors. The larger we get the more that is an issue. The second we put our guard down the enemies of bitcoin will pounce on that. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:10:00
from what im am reading. No one has been able to use the bitcoind api with segwit on testnet at all this whole time, as the code for it has not even been written yet. And that every single transaction on testnet was used with raw functions in bitcoind by hand or in custom written wallet code. 
so all the debugging from all the changes made in bitcoind have not even started for every service that uses bitcoind in the entire ecosystem. Changing between versions of bitcoind is a huge consideration and a major issue for large exchanges and things break and act very different under load between versions. and this process has not even started yet as it's not even written. 
I understand that the raw functionality needs to be written first. But imho segwit should never have been released without a functional reference client built. 
*edit. so apparently its completely trivial to get bitcoind to use segwit full time. just replace getnewaddress with addwitnessaddress and you are done.

They negotiated with core, they spoke with them, they made concessions. They agreed to wait for segwit.

Then why would the miners push and sign the Hong Kong agreement? They want big blocks and they want it 3 years ago. And they were told by representatives of core and the community that it was not only possible but core themselves would write and push for a July 2017 hard fork.
Raising supply to meet demand is how you maximize revenue. This artificially fixed supply is hurting their bottom line.

LN nodes can collect expose payment info just as easy, and even collect it in a more direct way. For instance a government agency could run a full node and collect information on any user sending to a known darknet channel. or collect information on a businesses revenue for tax purposes. or companies like chainanalysis can simply collect and store and sell to highest bidder. 


and I would be one of them. (well close second atleast) that is why I don't shit on altcoins trying to achieve it. and even support them by holding some.  
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:36:09


no, with big blocks AND LN they would get even more fees then without. because LN lets users who cant afford to transact the ability to join bitcoin and pay fees to miners. 
segwit is about to activate, and even with this increase of capacity it will do nothing to tame the out of control fee's. !remindme 1 month. 
are fees less or more then today?

@_date: 2017-08-24 22:57:19


median is not average. 
the average size is closer to 600+ and well over 10usd at this time. Not to mention that this problem is only getting worse and by the time LN is ready it will be much higher, assuming 2x fails to happen. 
and LN conduits are 2 of 2 multi-sig. so they will be much larger then normal transactions (while discounted with segwit) they will still be more expensive then normal txs. 


no he is promoting transaction MORE expensive that that, or he is promoting we stop letting new people use bitcoin. Either way, by not utilizing the capacity available today with segwit we are making the problem worse. and every minute we fail to utilize it more users are coming in and making the problem worse.

They wouldn't attack nodes to do that. They would simply attack miners that include those transactions. With a government controlling a large amount of hashpower they could orphan blocks with transactions they don't like. Keeps fees high and stagnant bitcoins growth, and censor any group they don't like from using bitcoin. 
The only way to prevent this is to grow the amount of miners on the network. And the only way to do that is to grow the revenue of said miners. 
small blocks limit miners revenue and therefore make us LESS secure from government meddling.

Comparing Bitcoin with traditional money services is apples and oranges. PayPal is great, until they fuck you out of hundreds of thousands of dollars because your business took in too many orders. Credit cards are convient until you accidentally accept stolen creds and loose millions of dollars of invintory that the credit card company won't reimburse.
Bitcoin solves online payment fraud. It solves banking bureaucracy. It's a permissionless payment system, and you can't put a price on that. It's priceless.
The rest are problems that will be addressed in time and are secondary to the primary goal. Decentralized hard currency for the masses.

I'm so fucking sick of this argument. The people who are the loudest are the users. And the exchanges. And those who actually depend on the network everyday as a business. They are the ones with support desks that fill up when blocks are full. Have to make sure customers get paid with txs that confirm. Even though all estimators suck when things move to fast. They have seen things get worse and worse; and customers never get the software they need fast enough. And now with segwit there is whole new dump truck of tech Dept about to hit wallets.

Search Bitcoin U**********, you will find a million people in the sub spreading FUD, including gmaxwell. As well as censorship on anyone saying anything positive claiming its *promotion.


That is because no one has authority. And you are getting at why the miners have such a hard time working with you. They asked for core. They got people like Adam Back there claiming to represent Blockstream and you had some of the most active core devs there. Sure I understand why when I say core did this* some of you take offense. But I'm saying those who took the time to show up did not disagree, and the core dev's who did show up  failed to ask other core devs if they disagree. So for all the miners knew, all of core was in agreement. Because if they thought otherwise they would of kept pushing to find out why and fix it.


And I totally 100pct disagree with that article. Multiple clients saved ETH, not endangered it. Same when he tries to use ETH/ETC to explain why a BTC hard fork is impossible. If they didnt fork their would always of been a division in the community and it would of been toxic to stay together anyway. 


And the other devs didnt catch it.


Pointing figures and blame does not make you look stronger. Not taking accountability for a potential network collapse; in a project that had a lot more then just Gavin and Mike working on it just makes my point more evident.


Do you think computing was benefited early by having behemoths like IBM run everything? Closed Architecture. Asking every single person on the project to work in the same codebase, with the same programming language, with the same bugs quarks and issues and, for the lack of the better word, Toxic developers is NOT diversity. Its not helpfull, and not even productive. A single reference client Its not how you define a protocol. And its not how to secure a network that needs to grow and support of hundreds of millions of people. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:34:57
But it was core that promised miners that they would write the hard fork for July 2017 themselves. That is why they wrote and signed the Hong Kong agreement.

His support for BU is not to block SegWit, it's to honer Gavin and the other devs who wanted to fix this before it became this much of a problem.

what is he even referring to with this? the fact segwit txs are larger? are they they really 10pct larger? or something else?
why put such a crazy discount on segwit tx's if they are going to hog bandwidth? (I guess to encourage additional capacity is a good reason)

with clogged mempools the rich are censoring the poor, preventing them from using bitcoin. if chase wanted to censor people from using bitcoin they could just buy up all the transaction space, and poof, no more bitcoin for the poor.


we dont need to compete with centralized systems, BUT we are competing in the cryptocurrency space every day, and every user we loose to altcoins hurts our most important asset. The network effect. 


the loss of millions of customers a day IS hurting our economic value, as it bleeds into alts.

we cant, because we are letting the artificial cap stick. 
many have proposed a dynamic limit, and I've been all for that. As i'm very confident in just a few years we will be revisiting to raise it beyond 2mb of non witness data. 


Not without a hard fork, no there is not. 


The best option is stand behind all other options, like layer2 segwit, shorr, mast, spoonet, and others. while at the same time keeping bitcoins network effect strong so devs have the resources needed to continue. 
That is why i'm very opposed to BCH, and honestly i'm opposed to anything that splits the network. But being in the industry I know the big block size is larger, despite how things feel in here. I know this. That is why I support taking radical measured to stop hemorrhaging users and bussinesses to alt's and doing everything we can to keep bitcoin strong and the primary crypto.
bitcoin doesn't need a killer app. the killer app is being good money. And the best money is one used by the largest network. We cant let anything get in the way of network growth and we absolutely must utilize all the resources we have. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:07:41


the milk is spilling and we are refusing to tip it back over. 
yea ATH of altcoin marketcap compared to bitcoin
the whole industry is exploding, and bitcoin is only capturing a small fraction of that anymore. 


i'm not saying that, segwit2x is about utilizing what resources we already have. 


yea..... that's not true at all. Bitcoin isnt the gold standard because it's innovative. Its because its the most stable and secure. and mostly because of its network size. 
 &gt;BTC will win
define win? stay stable with a gradual price increase while altcoins continue to explode and a few years down to the road loose its title as largest marketcap? then sure it will win. 
im here to change the world, Bitcoin is growing exponentially, and you want to throw that all away because of lies about node count being bottlenecked by bandwidth. the bottleneck in node count is purely demand, without more users, people don't need to run them. Expecting nodes to be run by charity and not for profit is totally missing why bitcoin is successful.

Long term, the market cap and economic activity show correlation. And because capicity is flat the more activity the higher the fees. The only way this will change is if we get larger blocks.
So unless you are saying less people will use Bitcoin the larger we get. long term Fees will always raise as USD price raises. Always.

no, he is saying don't use buses because too much weight is going to be on the roads. Even though buses relieve congestion and lower traffic; he would rather congestion continue and keep lighter cars on the road to decrease wear on the pavement.  
He is literally saying don't use the capacity increase and lower fees because he doesn't want to download a few extra kb per block. 
LN is like flying cars; they don't exist now, or atleast only experimentally.  so keep the roads congested and don't use buses until we get flying cars because flying cars need the roads for takeoff. even though core just spent the last 3 years building really cool buses.

That is not true. the use of LN requires on chain settlement of channels. And the more use, the more settlements. That settlement will cause fee's. miners still will get fees. Even with 2x, the cost of on chain settlement will continue to skyrocket as users keep joining bitcoin. 
miners are not opposed to LN, at all. Anything that grows bitcoin will increase their revenue. They are for anything that grows the the base. They are only opposed are things that hurt adoption. Like small blocks and high fees and congestion.

if you are trying to claim that full utilization will be enough to warrant not needing 2x (I think I finally understand the actual point you are trying to get at) I find that totally laughable.

I swear if 90pct of bitcoin holders all signed a message with their private keys saying please support bigger blocks you would probally find some bullshit as to why thats not true consensus too.
A few individuals in core don't want big blocks, and a large base of us here don't want to do something against core. (myself included) But im sick and tired of you guys pretending you are taking the high road and waiting for "consensus" when you have no idea what the fuck it means.

And there are examples of this throughout the entire project and *protocal that we are just stuck with for all time. (till we fork to fix them)

Lighting is useful if both parties already have bitcoin. But sending some new bitcoin its worthless. And you have to lock money to receive money. Lighting is not a bearer instrument like cash. Its not p2p. and even if we all used it as much as possible bitcoin still needs larger blocks to really scale with it.


Liquid is closed source proprietary software. So we don't know if it even really uses sidechains. In fact many think its just federated fancy multisig. But its not something you can use as an everyday user. You need millions to be part of the exclusive club using it. 
All the off chain solutions are not using bitcoin. they are not decentralized or trustless and ripe for people to be ripped off. 


The problem is many of the developers pushing agendas in bitcoin are pushing agendas based on blockstreams end to market goals. They want more people needing closed source expensive products like liquid so they can be gatekeepers and profit of it. And the majority of core devs are part of blockstream nowadays. 
There are many devs outside of core and blockstream; and many pushing non corrupted agendas.

A lighting tx to a new user is exactly the same amount of data as a normal tx. Because it is a normal tx. And that user can't trust it till it's on chain.
Lighting will result in tiers based on how much you can lock up. And only the rich will be able to move large amounts. These tiers and groups are not true p2p
I didn't claim lighting was blockstream.
However Blocking a hard fork is their goal, even if there is consensus. As not only will they loose timelocked funds. But all their proprietary solutions will be worthless if we can scale on chain.

again its called bitcoin. We dont know the utilization of segwit is going to be, but with current mix of multisig/normal tx the limit is about 2.1mb blocks...

Our goal should be a large number of reliable nodes in diverse regions. And a distributied reliance  on them. The only way to do that is expand our userbase and the amount of users who need to run nodes because of economic incentives.
Limiting userbase growth so non economic dependant people can run nodes as a hobby is just not going to let us grow. And our declining node count shows that.

Saving a few cents on fee's simply does not compare the developer headache of upgrading. 
This guide is craaazzyyy

I run many. And the only ones I truly keep up 24/7 are the ones that back services that I built and depend on them. 


And that makes users need to run them if they want to participate. People don't run nodes out of the goodness of their heart, they are forced too.


I disagree, the more economic actors the more nodes are needed. Individuals are just as likely to be attacked and the only solution is to grow and grow internationally. Growth that is so fast no single state could block it.

then mining gets more profitable for other facilities. and all the hardware that is still being manufactured will go to other smaller facilities when finished. if you think that china has 0 corruption your dead wrong. Word of such a large scale thing would get out. And those who are connected would get word before it happens and time to dismantle/move before the raids. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:50:40


again, these are all configurable. 
The average user would want to follow the longest chain. so I understand the default. and if you don't want this you can stay on the shorter with configuring.
So the main difference between BU and core is BU actually defines consensus. Being full nodes + miners.
When core calls nodes signaling bigger blocks by nodes a sibyl attack. And miners signaling a 51pct attack. So they have no method to define consensus. and because something cant be defined it can never be reached. So this is a nice position to have if you don't want something to change.
There are many other ways we can do a dynamic limit like this. And i'm very open to discussion. But the current narrative that something is hard so it will never happen is just not going to sit with me.

Then why did they sign the HK agreement with a hard fork in july 2017 shorty after the release of segwit?
Pretending the only voices that matter are core devs. And the Users/miners and HODLers don't matter is the exact reason why there is so much conflict in our community. Claiming there is no debate is exactly why 13pct of the network is saying F**** you were not going to run core anymore.

This debate is 4 years old. BCH is less than a month old and had almost no support at the start. It is a symptom of years of deadlock and apparent stagnation. It was never the goal.
Bitcoin miners livelyhood is tied to Bitcoin and yes even it's devs. It's a symbiotic relationship. That is why they have tried patiently to get everyone on the same page of the blocksize debate. They insisted on flying out core devs to work with them. They jump on any opportunities to show unity and try to remain neutral.
All this scapegoating and blaming others for our own problems are not going to get us anywhere. We need to figure this out for ourselves.

This is not true. Only 40pct of nodes even run segwit currently. And we don't even know how many of these are economic.

the SEC can only regulate United state customers. It does not have jurisdiction over anyone else.
Therefore if you service US customers, even if your Chinese, selling Chinese sockets, on a Chinese market. you are breaking the law and the US government will come over to china and punish you.
However, if your bussiness is only servicing non US customers, SEC cant do shit, and you can do a lot more. Including selling securities backed on the blockchain.
There are a lot of sites that do this, and many even service US customers anyway. I just don't trust them enough to link them for you.

I've found that it's that is completely uninformed on what BU is. Don't know the difference between it and btcfork subreddit. Don't understand why viabtc opposed segwit. Never were allowed to read statements from Roger showing support for segwit. Never are allowed to read statements from him personally. Never get to read statements from Chinese miners over the blocksize debate unless it's follows your moderation narrative.
Yet I constantly see misinformation posted if it's following an anti rbtc narrative. 
This division is widening because of all the anti Roger hate that's spreading and it's almost all negative and most is straight up misinformation and half truths. That only spread because of the ignorance of the sub. The users here are less informed on current events and have biased viewpoints that are almost impossible to break.
It reminds me a lot of fox news. With a userbase to this day that thinks Obama is Muslim. Doesn't understand current events, yet will fight tooth and nail to support positions they don't even understand in public.

Artificially limiting the supply makes scarcity. Like in socialism this creates shortages and instability. Limiting the revenue of the miners is a tax on Bitcoin. Allowing fees to skyrocket during panicks is a tax.

Ah yes memes and scare tactics that's quality education right here.
Your premise that big blocks will hurt full node count is just not founded in reality.
ETH has more full nodes then BTC and it's bandwith requirements are astronomical compared to btc.
More Users who need a full node for commerce will result in more full nodes. So that means we need to grow the base.
5k nodes is a tiny botnet. We are not very decentralized now, and that is not because of bandwith. There is 0 evidence that the growing blockchain has slowed down node count because node count has remained steady. Like the size of the userbase. It is much more logical to draw correlation between userbase and amount of full nodes. Or even better economic activity. And that economic activity is stagnant because of congestion and small blocks.

Because less people using Bitcoin is going to result in more full nodes. Lol.
No, the more people who use Bitcoin and need a trusted node for commerce the more nodes we will get.
The only way we will expand is if more large institutions get into Bitcoin. And they all are waiting to get in. Go go money 20/20 or the Shanghai Bitcoin conference and the banks are just laffing  at Bitcoin. Saying they want to use blockchain, but Bitcoin won't work for them.

lol no, you forgot the Free part. its a tollway, it doesn't matter if its empty or full. The whole point of a free market is the tollway gets to decide the pricing. And its the pricing that determines how full the roads are. Through price discovery they can optimize their business for profit. or they can make it soo expensive the roads are empty because fuck you. (Like mining empty blocks)
If they think they can get more money, they simply raise the price. No one gives a shit if the roads are full or not, so this hypothetical magic truck that is free to drive, so they pay them to fill up the road is pointless gibberish. 
Tollway can price the tolls to keep the roads at optimum capacity and can raise the price anytime they know demand is strong and people can afford it. 
When tollways can price their own goods, and governments dont interfere and tell them what cost is too high or how many cars they are allowed to accept, Roads will always be at optimum capacity no matter the demands.

They are totally separate, and there is no logical way to combine the two. 
(some argue they did write the code, and while I think that is laughable I don't wish to argue that point anymore)  I'm just saying if core devs cared what Garzic did, they had plenty of time to write the code themselves, as that is what everyone wanted in the first place.

Its not perfectly clear that the signers had no intention for follow-through. That they will fail to push for the fork outlined. Fail to formally submit code, or fail to attempt at any formal process of allowing a hard fork by july 2017; or even define a hard consensus metric to allow this.  


I wouldn't, nor have I seen anyone attack it. I think it is cool to use other number systems and new implementations with devs personal coding pref's. I can even get over the blacklists as its your own project.  
full rbf is an entirely different bag of worms. 


And here we go with the true Scotsman debate. 
They never broke consensus, and you only disagree with their ability to allow consensus to change.
and yet in your other post you claim


So really your calling anything that you don't 100pct agree with personally is an attack and an "altcoin", and there is just no basis for this by any rational person. It just so detached from reality to say this. As everyone who ever ran those software followed the exact same rules as any other project.

fees are priced in Bitcoin. And are deturmined by traffic on the network. And as the USD price rise has almost no negative effect on traffic, clearly fees rise as the price rises. And one could argue long term, rising prices increases economic activity on the network, therefore raising the amount of traffic, and demand in the fee market goes up.
So not only is the price going up with USD value. But fees go in BTC value as well.

segwit doesn't censor users. and every single core dev who worked on segwit would tell you that a miner shouldn't signal it until they understand it.
 &gt;And anyway you should lookup the ghash.io situation where it used its massive miner power to steal from online bitcoin casinos.
im aware. that is the same risk the non segwit2x side of bitcoin has if they allow 90pct plus of miners to leave. any exchange using the old bitcoin will raise confirms to 20+ like we did with bitcoin cash. slow blocktimes and 20+ confirms is going to be a nightmare for users, and therefore support desks.
but again, that is NOT censoring a user from using bitcoin. That is inherit danger of a business using bitcoin.

are all you concerns valid? sure. Are they a shitty service? yes. Do a lot people get turned off of bitcoin because of how shitty they are? absolutely. am i promoting coinbase? no. I am simply listing the only services that you can use CC and traditional banking to get bitcoin at a decent rate.

So you agree, that highly technical people agreed with the hard fork.
Kinda makes this comparison totally wrong.


and 


A couple rough drafts with the word bip on it is total joke of a proposal. trying to claim the core devs in attendance upheld the agreement is like a child saying he cleaned his room by sweeping some dirty cloths under his bed. it might be technically correct but it totally misses the entire intent of the agreement.


Then why do you continue to claim there is no debate? miners clearly do not agree with you that there is no debate. Nor do the largest exchanges and business. And that is why they are moving to BU. And same with HODLRs. 


NO, You clearly dont understand bitcoin. If you continue to ignore what the miners want you will continue to see the network move away from core. Excatly the trend we are seeing now with both nodes and miners switching to BU.
Keep pretending we don't matter and the only opinions that matter the 20-30 or so active core devs. See what happens.

I did not claim it was core. Just that the signers were technical. 
are you claiming the devs who signed it are lunatics like (Moon hoaxers. UFO's, climate change...) ???


If you opened your poll to users, miners, bussiness's and HOLDrs  I think you would find overwhelmingly support for the agreement. If it could of been done in a way the 1. defines consensus. 2. only activates with consensus.
Problem is core refuses to define it, therefore its impossible to ever reach consensus on a hard fork.
If the majority of nodes is a sybil attack, and a majority of miners is a 51pct attack. What IS consensus then? 


XT tried bips, classic tried bips, you really think the bip process is an achievement or worth it at this point? He didn't try. What he did do is write software that 13pct of mining power on the bitcoin network is now running. 
That represented companies worth millions; invested and trusting BU's work. 


And that is the whole point. You don't have money invested in businesses built on bitcoin like miners and exchanges do. You don't care the same way say Coinbase does.

and failing as what happened in Russia, Vensualia ext where almost any asset is more valuable then the funds going to buy it.

you show a vast misunderstanding on what payment channels are. Not only is the initial funding of the channel just as susceptible to RBF double spend attacks as a normal tx; but malleability and other factors make it completely impractical for high value tx's as warned in its own [documentation]( 
also, your mistaken to think blockcypher would have anything to gain from a [sybil attack]( nor have they ever been accused of such. in fact sybil attacks primarily [increase]( the potential of a double spend attack on users. Mainly SPV nodes are unable to properly validate tx's. High sybil nodes are absolutely something blockcypher would monitor globally as it would decrease the confidence they have a tx will confirm. and are a method to attempt to double spend against them. Blockcypher simply monitors global nodes and makes educated guesses on confidence depending on network properties. understanding on dust limits, fee priorities, mempool conditions are all something anyone can do. But they make it a full time job, and even give up this info publicly without any cost to you and I.
There are other technological options, but things like the lightning network and privacy evasive "green address super nodes" solutions are far from ready for core bitcoin integration. And therefor extremely far from ready to be implemented in services processing and handling millions of dollars daily. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:54:02
actually if RBF was adopted services like coinbase/SS would simply have to drop 0confirms all together and force people to wait the sometimes hour+ for a block. customers are going to get pissed off, ,there numbers might get  hurt, but its  not essential to there business. simply a convenience.. 
im not an altcoin person, but even I start to see advantages when bitcoin core devs make such reckless decisions as dropping first seen policies.

that would most likely be law enforcement, the bank or an other party that is not your family and not entitled to the money.


because they insure against its loss. (well its available not standard apparently)


what if little jimmy lost his code? everyone is fucked. what if the 3 people conspire and decide to take the money early? same reason why I didn't say just hand the paper wallet to the benefactors.
you would be amazed how incapable people are of storing paper documents like that.
digital drop box is possible, but my example was intending on making sure 1. the lawyer doesn't have direct access to your funds. and 2. the second factor is physically secure.
offline wallets are popular for a reason so hosting online feels dirty. and this example gives you the best of both worlds.

 You want to *sell* bitcoins. you get your fiat payment. And for all you know its done. You have no motivation to actually release the btc. and never log in again.
Unless the buyer contacts paypal and has the payment reversed. then you NEED the buyer to release the btc back to you. And the buyer might never login again. then your just out BTC and didn't gain anything.

Buying or selling is money transmission. MTLs are issued state by state
@_date: 2016-02-14 21:25:57
Anyone that does not upgrade is in danger of accepting payments on the wrong fork. Many companies run on large systems that were built by a single dev that probably doesn't even work there anymore. Many companies dont use core releases and instead massive codebases of crazy bitcoinj custom clients. 
That and many services just dont give a shit or pay their devs enough to give a shit.
It's like updating a new OS. There is a reason people still run windowsXP. Imagine if windows released 10 and said anyone that doesn't upgrade will brick their computers. Guaranty users will still end up with lots of bricks.

make a secure wallet. (preferentially offline) give him an address. dont trust the payment till its confirmed.
if you import a private key you both have absolutely equal access to that money. its not "yours" till you sign a tx to an address that only you own.
so  both ways you are waiting for confirmations. and should never make actions till its confirmed. (if he owes you then its not much an issue. if your about to hand him a car you need to wait before taking that action)
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:58:08
well the network forking and users choosing to run BU as the dominant side of the fork would be proof....
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:33:21
All it takes is a single invalid segwit tx in the other side of the fork and the SegWit side of the network will reject the longest chain forever. 
And even without a theft of SegWit inputs the network can split over and over again.
Once there are 2 coins on exchanges there will always be 2 coins. Forever.

They don't want SegWit. They want the HK agreement and 2mb of non witness data.

Thanks, I've read this in the past. They even admit the problems.
To put it plainly, no reputation system is resistant to a Vendor purchasing their own items and making false-positive ratings.
This is especially true of a pseudonymous decentralized marketplace, where Buyer identities are – by default – undisclosed. Even a web-of-trust model, which is excellent at detecting suspicious islands of ‘reputable’ users, will not be able to distinguish between real and fake ratings of a Vendor. Why? As discussed, Buyer identities are not disclosed in the transaction summaries (unlike trade receipts, which is necessary for dispute resolution); 
It's just sad to me most people dont realize how impossible this task is do in a decentralized manner. And instantly wonder why we can't just make eBay with bitcoin.
If this releases like this a lot of people are going to get scammed. But its a good experiment regardless. 
I just don't like devs saying "ready" when we are so far from even a plan on how to build something.

@_date: 2016-02-10 22:23:47
no absolutely not, the only reason classic isn't putting more into a fork is because they are too afraid any other changes will make it less likely to pass consensus.
last time there was a fork OKcoin lost tens of thousands of dollars accepting a 6 confirmation transaction. 
    
Forcing people to upgrade or potentially loose a money. is NOT something that should be done often. Many Many merchants are going to loose money if this fork happens. People simply dont upgrade. Some dont have the means, systems build by devs that don't work there anymore. Some wont be informed or prepared. And most importantly Every single bitcoin business will most likely shut down until a clear fork winner is found. Potentially weeks if the miners are contentious (not a clear hashing majority on a fork).  It is just too risky to stay open and accept tx's on ether fork till its clear who the miners support.
pretending like this is something that should become common place is showing complete ignorance as what is about to happen.

eh, this model actually makes it pretty low risk of getting arrested shipping drugs. all these risks are in fraud and scam's; and they arise because we allow merchants to be anonymous. so you could argue this is more about customers who are willing to make extremely high risk tx's hoping a merchants rep is creditable. so it fits darknets model a lot.

there will be a second chain if miners want there to be a chain. there is no way to FORCE a re-org and a delist on exchanges. Old nodes might follow the reorg, but anyone who ran invalidateblock will be on the old chain. and they have a massive economic incentive to push this as 1. exchanges already listed it, did all work for it, and are profiting from it. 2. after the re targeting it will still be profitable for miners to stay on it. 3.

your example....... Trading starts on Exchange AbcXyz......
the whole premise of this convo???????
I had a double take if your really OP.
what im saying is the re-org WILL NOT HAPPEN ON THE EXCHANGE NODE. only on default old nodes will this happen. 
In order for slide 6 to happen. Exchanges AND users must get set up to protect from replay protection AND to follow the intended chain. this is a requirement to trade and establish market price. Its a good thing that both invalidateblock already exists. and replay protection has been given a ton of dev work recently. so your slides are correct. EXCEPT FOR SLIDE 17
the old chain will NOT die. That is how the world works. When it is profitable to keep it alive, the community will. It is trivial to do. where there is a will, there is a way.

why do they need a bank account you ask? because taxes must be paid by a check/bank wire. Or pay lots of extra money for cash deposit.
The only way anything will get better is if the government starts accepting bitcoin for taxes. and banks have a lot on the line to lobby for that not happening. hell even the departments that make an extra 10-20pct in taxes on extra fee's for accepting cash have a lot to loose by allowing that as well.

For instance. I'm a seller, I give weight of item, dated proof of item before shipping, and shipping proof of delivery verified with shipper (ie ups usps bla bla) third party verified.
I STILL cant prove I actually put an item in the box and not a brick that weighs the same.
and on the order side. I cant prove a receiver didn't swap package out for a brick and then tried to contest the shipping and demand a return.

the problems we are having with miner centralization is not because china is so good at mining. Its the rest of the world is failing to pull their own weight.
Im not opposed to blocking asicboost if there is consensus on that. But in general anything that helps miners perform better at their task the better it is for the network.
were the first fpgas an unfair advantage? were the first asics unfair advantage? what happens when x new chip tech get patented and x new company figures out how to stack chips or some shit and get a new 30pct+ advantage that only they can leverage?

Once miners mine blocks they are economicly inclined to do whatever it takes to keep those rewards. Once an exchange lists a second coin they are going to keep it. And as long as exchanges have a market miners will mine that chain.
This is why I talk about the most likely senerio is 3 coins in this thread.
Btc uasf, btc old + theft tx, and BU.
As BU will activate as soon as they see UASF activate and drop off the network. Instantly triggering 75pct+.

 8/. Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

ASICBOOST allows miners to secure our network better. The more efficient the asic chips the better. not only that but jihan is not the only one with asicboost. There are 4 companies applying for patents on it. And they all have been sueing each other for an entire year.

absolutely not true. Those systems are identity based. your legal name and other things are screened. Scammers have to use stolen credit cards and other stolen payment systems/identification and it is much much harder to do. 
there is a reason why people hate paypal. There fraud system is extremely sensitive and rigorous. That is why most peoples funds get frozen. they require dramatic amount of legal documents. they are asshole not because they like to be, but that is what it takes to maintain markets with the massive amounts of fraud they have to deal with. 


is so laffable. Fraud on ebay and systems they spend millions(probably in the billions) on, state of the art fraud detection and enforcement, and even after that fraud is still rampant. 
The truth is identity based systems are broke and not sustainable. digital currency solved the payment part of online payments. But reputation and trust are still very much open for innovation. but cant just be replaced with nothing

A global ledger denotes possession of all coins by public accounts. A transaction is broadcasted and the asset is moved between accounts. Nothing is given to you as the receiver. Your wallet detects this change by monitoring the global ledger and your balance reflects   it. 
To put this into perspective. A user could make an address (keypair) with pen and paper. And receive money. All without ever getting on a computer. This is how offline wallets work.

only to default nodes. Not forced on every node on the network.
more context to what invalidateblock is for.... (exactly this kind of thing....)
thezerg1 Andrew Stone - Bitcoin Unlimited Lead Dev
    Funny thing a solution already exists. Its a hidden RPC called invalidateblock and was already in the "Satoshi" clients when BU was started. Basically if the large block chain started to be overtaken by the small, anyone who wanted to "stick" onto a minority hash shorter length large block chain could "invalidateblock" the 1mb chain.
gavinandresen Gavin Andresen - Bitcoin Dev
    Yes, IF the old 1mb chain survived without a difficulty reset hard fork...
    ... and IF speculators managed to pump up the price of that less-functional, less-secure chain so it was more financially attractive to mine...
    ... and IF the financial reward to mine on that chain was high enough for long enough to overcome cost of coinbase transactions on the big chain that they would never get to spend (because the 1mb chain difficulty catches up and passes the &gt;1mb chain)...
    ... THEN there is an easy, already-in-the-code way to stay on the &gt;1mb chain: just call invalidateblock with the hash of one of the 1mb chain blocks.

agreed, not only that they are also incompatible with reality and are impossible to enforce.

Some would argue they are exceptionally high always now. because so many more people use bitcoin now then in the past. And that the "spam attacks" are really just periods of high transaction volume and a race to the top of big actors willing to spend anything to get high value tx's through.


you understand how ironic that is claiming that. Because what you are promoting with 1mb forever is exactly that. Slowing adoption in a futile attempt protect decentralization.
When in reality a larger userbase means more nodes, and more decentralization.

Antbleed would never have been found if it was closed source like bitfury. It's telling that you care less about securing the network then getting your​ way.
And bitmain isn't blocking SegWit. They just build the hardware they don't own it. It's the pools. And it's the refusal to realese code that could singal bigger blocks that forces miners to run BU.
And even if the 60pct of miners running BU signaled SegWit. You would still be short miners. So is BU stopping SegWit or is SegWit blocking SegWit.

And all the time while the non UASF chain is shorter you are BREAK bitcoin for all old nodes.
The whole point of a soft fork IS NOT BREAKING BITCOIN FOR OLD NODES.
If you are ok with breaking bitcoin for old nodes why not just flag a hard fork????
@_date: 2017-04-20 02:19:30


It can if non segwit miners are willing to orphan segwit miners. 


Right, not anyone. But a single malicious miner could manually include theft tx's. And all non segwit nodes will relay that BLOCK. (I know tx's wont get relayed) But to all non segwit nodes that block is valid, and non segwit miners will keep mining on it. 
for non segwit nodes the correct chain is the longest VALID chain. And if this chain with the thefts is longer, old nodes will accept that chain as truth.

Free to operate pot business. Pot is a multi-billion dollar industry and ripe for entrepreneurs. It has a culture; concerts; it has a tourist industry. It is a act shared by cultures all over the world and is equally oppressed and leads to many arrests and even deaths worldwide. Our legal weed is an expression of freedom seen around the world. People from the middle east that smoke just as large in numbers as here in the US cant do so legally. Same with Europe (just decriminalized in some places). They all can relate to just how much liberty we can share/allow in the US that we can legalize and regulate. I am proud  to live in a country that does this. And look forward to more states doing the same. (even NH)
I just fail to see NH being and more "Free" then any other state by just lowering some state taxes. We still are taxed higher then any other country from the federal level.

Banks hoard; not people. Banks only care about the profitiblity of the bank. The users of a currancy save. Savings Used to drive economys. Savings bought land bussiness ext. when you let banks control the currancy no one saves. All land is bought on loan. Bussiness are all owned by the banks. So your left with banks controlling econimic indicators. Spurring the economy is doing anything you can to convince banks to lend. Banks act very differnt then users. People save bitcoins till they got enough for that asic miner. They buy when the currancy is high because they know they got extra spending power. The spiral is a banking instrument. When banks see no one is lending they follow suit. Bitcoin increases in transactions when its high. Look at the charts. And most importly of all in the conversation. Bitcoin encourges competing curriancys. Something we havnt seen in a very long time.

No decentralization has not failed. lol what is wrong with you? as long as the network continues to process payments. And no government or private corporate entity can censor or block a peer 2 peer transaction bitcoin has succeeded.  
What the miners are doing is protecting us from that. and you cant handicap the competition to make a more fair market.

so whats to keep me as a buyer from refusing to release funds after I got the item? maybe even appeal to the moderator and ask for a refund.
and whenever that model gets deployed sellers will force new buyers to always pre-release funds. or release funds after proof of shipping. Both can lead to issues.
in most cases its even impossible to be effective moderating like this even for honest and diligent moderators.
For instance. I'm a seller, I give weight of item, dated proof of item before shipping, and shipping proof of delivery verified with shipper (ie ups usps bla bla) third party verified.
I STILL cant prove I actually put an item in the box and not a brick that weighs the same. and on the order side. I cant prove a receiver didn't swap package out for a brick and then tried to contest the shipping and demand a return.
and reputation doesn't solve the problem of a user building up trust. Scamming on a very large order. Then opening a new account to build up trust again.
There is a reason ebay and paypal put multi-millions into identity based payments systems. and Fraud detection. and so many hoops to jump trough to set up a merchant account.

No, it would be the exact same coin it was before default nodes did a re-org. same rewards, same chain, same coin. and if it got longer again old nodes would re-org back to it. aka this is a soft-fork. 


Its nothing "he" would do. BU nodes would see that the instant UASF nodes dropped from the network that BU is 75pct+ of the mining power. This would trigger BU. 
So, like I said elsewhere in this thread. a UASF flag day would most likely result in 3 coins. BTC-segwit, BTC-old with stolen segwitTx's (the focus of that last few comments) and BU. 
Old nodes could go in-between the first two based on length, because to them they are BOTH valid (even with the thefts). and BU would trigger when segwit miners drop off the network. 
so yea, all this is much better then just flag day 2mb/segwit as a community as a whole /s

There is a market for everything, I'm not predicting a winner. Just that the entire community will loose. From all the old nodes getting fucked for being on the wrong chain accepting payments. To the users who really think x side is for the best for bitcoin and spend x money they dont have to prove it. To the split of the networks final marketcap.
The true outcome of something like this is more chaotic this this. big blockers probably using this time to fork to 2mb anyway. So the final result would be 3 coins. 
the only people winning in all this is exchanges, taking x pct fee for every trade in this insanity. .

not if you run a simple rpc command, invalidateblock. and any exchange or miner that wants control and not to accidentally fuck themselves out a ton of money will do this regardless. they are not stupid. 
your acting like exchanges dont know what the fuck is going on. And just use a client on default settings. 
Your completely naive like a child. exchanges will do what is in their best interest. And keeping an asset and chain alive is the most profitable path forward and miners WILL NOT GIVE UP THEIR BLOCK REWARDS. 
It might continue to get smaller, it might never surpass UASF. But that asset exists as long as a community wants it to exist. that is what we learned from ETC.

Gold miners work is defined by the laws of physics. And that is why gold is good money. Really bitcoin boils down to the same laws as well.


That would be a violation of the protocol. Nothing about being better at hashing is a violation. That being said, yes, I would prefer they steal and take the bug bounty so we can fix an issue like that NOW and not when bitcoin is bigger.

The whole point of UASF is a flag day that instantly activates segwit. Even with minority of miners. read slide 1. 


If the majority of miners don't know what segwit is, a single mined block with theft tx's will be accepted as the longest valid chain. Miners know not to accept segwit tx's themselves, but they will just ignore them in other blocks. Not only would is be easy for a small pool to mine a theft tx. But other miners will be incapable of even detecting the theft. and old nodes will still be on the longest valid chain according to its own rules. (that dont include segwit)

As a seller I have almost no incentive for actually shipping a product.
I can build as much reputation as a I want with fake orders with sock puppet accounts. I could apply to be the moderator of my own orders and scam people that way. Or I could just take peoples money ship bricks and contest to the moderator I have shipping proof and release my damn money. 
if it fails, just try again. 
vr, actually ship products and have to fight tooth and nail to make sure the moderator releases my funds. and hope my customers are responsive after they get there items (because most wont be, learned from bitmit something like 90pct wouldn't even log back in to give a rating) and then i'm struggling trying to restock my store fighting with a moderator to release my funds.

@_date: 2017-04-24 20:20:54
well in this example here i'm not even talking about reversal. i'm talking about general unresponsiveness. 
Requiring an action from the seller to release is dangerous. As a seller I already got paid. Why do I need to come back into the website and release? Its totally neutral for me to do it. 
If you had 1. reputation system then I would be *slightly* more motivated to come back in and release. 
or 2. the best solution is NOT doing a 2of2 multi-sig, but a 2-3. And the third actor be YOU (or a moderator from a pool like bitsquare) if any party goes unresponsive you can resolve to the active party. This will be about 90pct all moderation activity as it is to fricken common. its amazing, even people who are out 10k+ people go unresponsive for weeks; It happens all the time. (people are just crazy) (this is coming from working with people who did escrow services in the past)
the other 10pct of a moderators activity will be from scammers who know the system in and out and will sweet talk you all day to convince you to release early, or trick you to think the other user is the scammer. this is where reversals come into play. 
Either way, moderation is the hardest part of p2p exchanges, because its just not possible to write algorithms that can handle it.

NO, to list 2 coins on an exchange like this you already need replay protection and the ability to invalidate chains. Old nodes might reorganize but all the new miners are bound to that alternative chain and will invalidate the other to stay on it. And users will configure to do the same.

is NOT something definable yet. I want you to define it in a way that cant be manipulated. 
because as soon as you define it to satisfy the community we can use that definition to show support for 2mb of non witness data. 
we have been trying to prove consensus on both miners and nodes for the hard fork for three years. and the community refuses to define it so we cant prove support. 
classic came out and had a huge run of nodes. core claimed it a sybil attack. 
BU comes out and hit majority of miners and now claims its a 51pct attack. 
If there is no definition of consensus, there never can be  consensus for a fork. then core wins without users ever being given a vote.

All they can do is negitive PR. All the time people come in and ask what if they bought all the bitcoins. Anyone buying bitcoins helps the community; regardless if they "hoard". It increases the wealth of everyone who holds. If some evil genius tried a 51pct attack with a super computer. Hashing would increase and transactions confirmations would speed up. If they got close to 51 it would be a giant call to arms of the community to increase hashing. It would make the project stronger in the long run.

actually the smallest unit in the source code originally from Satoshi Nakamoto that is the foundation for the entire network only goes to 8 decimal places. A client might be adjustable to more but the network is not.  
Denominations are .1 centi-bitcoin .01 milli-bitcoin ext with the only excption being .00000001 is 1 Satoshi in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto the pseudonym of the inventor of Bitcoin
Although it is to be noted that Satoshi did talk about the ability to extend it at a later dates in one of his early posts before he went silent.   
Statoshi did say he left additional bits that could be used to extend decimal places. 
Bitcoin ("a Satoshi"), but unused bits are available in the protocol fields that could be used to denote even smaller subdivisions.

You are so wrong. Spend any time around a support desk. Even people following the recommended fees get stuck for 6+ hours all the time and blow up desks. Extremely common, and people get pissed.  
in fact  is a lot more conservative on fees and I recommend it more often then btc.com. 
And even with all this, during high volumes it is literally impossible to predict and that is why services like bitgo who service large exchanges use 800+sat/byte recommendations because for a business like an exchange its worth the extra money for reliability. 
ask some of the bitgo engineers. We are slowing getting to a point where just bitgo's services are filling up entire blocks. At this rate we will get to a point only exchanges can afford to move bitcoin during high volume periods.

ok, so prior to bifinex issue. say bitfinex has 100mill in fiat and 100mill in btc.
users with btc can withdrawal. But users with fiat have to buy bitcoin.
users with fiat buy bitcoin and the price skyrockets.
bitfinex is at 80mill fiat, and like 20mill btc left.
IF you trusted bitfinex you could buy btc on say coinbase and send to bitfinex. but then you are stuck with fiat. (but in theory made money)
as bitfinex gets worse and worse the people stuck in fiat get more and more desperate. because no one trusts bitfinex there is no more BTC coming in.
so the price will continue to raise to infinity as the exchange goes into a death spiral.
as bitcoin levels go to 0, the price for those coins go to infinity.
the only way for fiat to leave the system is to buy the dwindling amount of btc leftover.

you hit on something there. Yes a bank takes your money and uses fractional reserve lending. So yes banks loan money, and no bitcoin client doesn't loan, only users. But do most people take loans from banks? Do I as a everyday person put my money into a bank for the sole purpose of letting the bank make loans for homes business ext? no.  In fact if It wasn't for FDIC I would be very cautious about letting a bank loan my money. and if it wasn't for the government bailing out the banks in 07 everyone's balance would of been lost. so bitcoin client is actually "safer" because it is full reserve method of storing wealth.  
When we have national inflation over 3pct &lt;official; really it is much higher&gt; banks paying interest is a fucking joke. Your savings account interest is so epically tiny. It will never beat inflation, most CD's don't even nowadays. now compare that with the increase in price of bitcoin over the last year.
piggy banks aren't worth anything, its the dollars you put in them. Those dollars rely on a full system of banks. so the analogy completely misses the point. 
Bitcoin is a full monetary system. It replaces everything from the Federal reserve printing the money; to the banks issuing the currency, to the multibillion dollar system of ACH processing cheques. much more then a "piggybank"

SegWit is not 4mb equivalent capacity, it is not 2mb of non witness data as called for in the HK agreement.* 


You're talking to a group that has been patiently waiting for 3 YEARS to gain consensus on a fork. 


are the people still claiming the 1mb is too large. cough and that with ANY holdouts its impossible to reach consensus on a hard fork. 
There is a happy medium, hold outs will get left behind (that is their choice). but the network will not allow itself to remain crippled like this forever. Eventually we will break free and reach a level of participation in BU (or whatever is next, maybe core with 2mb) that is adequate for the hark fork process to start.

All banks are fractional reserve anyway; and yes Pirate is most likely fractional reserve. 
That is to say his accounts likely outpace his actual holdings. 
But back to the important point. Get cash on hand and get ready to buy as late as Saturday. Bitinstant.com takes market order with cash deposits at any bank. Wells Fargo is open until 7pm Saturday.
If there is instability in the market it would be a great way in.
*completely speculation*
 7.50 was reached on Sunday. I think there is potential in the next couple days to hit that again. Large accounts are moving*
*we can watch it on the blockchain. 
If there is a drop people who have coins need to know not to panic. If there is a panic that I seem to get on some on the forums its possible to could get really low quick. but I dont want to talk about that.
I recommend getting cash on hand. watching the price carefully this week. if the price hits 7.50 watch the drop, as soon as it just nudges positive, walk into a local branch and place and your order with
bitinstant.com cash under 1000$ per transaction
You can wait as late as saturday 7pm*
 be sure to check your local time
tl;DR get ready for a deal this week, you can buy at late as 7pm sat. But this is a good week to do it!

I'm sure banks historically have lost more clients money then bitcoin.
the largest bitcoin hack ive herd about was 40k or 400,000USD out of a trading site. 
Banks loose millions all the time, shit the federal reserve looses billions 
Also the network is not hackable, and the best hackers in the world are working on it. It is merely the end clients or wallets holding them that are as weak as the user. 
Long term bitcoin losses will be miniscule to the major flaws in our current monetary system.

I checked out deepbit, But my graphics didnt do it very well. I was pulling almost 280 watts and could only mine at 100m/hash got .01 into my wallet after about 3 hours mining. and damn my cards were dumping heat.   
I have dual Nvida 550/sli running a 6000x1080 triple screen display. I can run most games at high lvl's But in the world of mining my rig is lame sauce.
We are talking pure high end processing and power efficiency critical. If I were going to start mining id buy this. 
800m/hash at 80 watts. 8times my hashing at a third the power. Its a little beast.

Combining these studies, with the knowledge that vast Marjory of malware is not known. as over a million new malware programs are cataloged daily. and the even higher percentage of malware that is disguised as legitimate services.

Im actually debating this same thing, I really want to get into mining but these upcoming performance numbers are crazy. 
BFL sc single is going to be 40g/h at 1060$ 
This is a only 27g/h at similar price.
Im thinking really hard of buying a Jalapeno 3.5gig/has for only 160$
The big issue is how the market is going to be. Im not worried of the price crashing, but I don't see it taking off that far either.
With other people mining at 40gig/hash or there miner at 1tera/hash the network is getting a massive boost.

the people "behind" bitcoin are the people holding bitcoin. And yes If Im a business and I'm accepting bitcoin I "trust" that large holders wont dump there coins and crash the price while im holding them. 
That actually is a lot of trust as the history isn't that good. That is why I recommend business's to not hold BTC and sell them on MTgox at market rate as soon as they hit there account.
I choose Diamonds because it is a classic example of scarcity. It is imperative banks hold large amounts and not sell them. DeBeers used to hold 80pct of all the mined diamonds on the planet. That is how it was able to raise the price even though there really is a lot of diamonds in the world.
Im not saying bitcoins or even diamonds for that matter cant serve as currency. But if somehow a single bank got ahold of 80pct of the bitcoins and held them they could raise the price. And if bitcoin still expanded; they make a lot of money. Same reason investors hold bitcoin as an investment.     
@_date: 2012-08-19 16:35:22
Yup, Pitate40 controlls large amounts of usd and btc. He needs to payout a very large amount of btc he probally doesnt have. If I were him id dump enough to crash the price then buy enough to cover the payouts.

I actually like him pushing for smaller blocks. It just reiterates how detached from reality dev's can be from users/services/businesses. 
I would really get a kick seeing spending a day working at polo for bitfinex's support desk. or even some time with the dev's talking about just how much work goes into dealing with a fee market and keeping money flowing. Or having a nice talk about how crappy bitcoind is at maintaining large UXTO's sets because leveldb is a piece of shit. 
devs live in their little bubbles and never really need to use bitcoin much or work with it in a business atmosphere. so saying something like lets lower blocksize to 300k just doesn't compute as being ridiculous.

there are no rules preventing people from staying on BOTH sides of a soft fork. It might not be default behavior as old nodes will re-org. But as the premise of this post is listing them on an exchange and miners being incentivised by a higher trading price on UASF. The most likely senerio isn't that the second the other chain gets longer people give up and delist the coin from the exchange. The exchange and users can simply run a rpc command invalidateblock and keep on running/trading the other side indefinitely. 
so, like the ETH/ETC event. assuming you know the outcome before it happens is ill advised. as there are no rules preventing you from being wrong.

People who don't understand bitcoin keep talking about bitcoin "banks". Bitcoin is made so you act as your own bank. You can hold all your money risk free. for the non tech savvy they can use offline paper wallets for 0 risk; new concept of "money under your mattress". If you want to use a bank, put your paper wallet in a banks safety deposit box.
What does a bank do? Hold and transfer money. what does bitcoin client do? hold and transfer money, much more efficiently then a bank.
And bitcoin is full reserve, and much cheaper to send money.
plus the increase in value over time of bitcoin puts "interest" payouts from banks in the dust.

if transactions went up 10x tomorrow fee's would be astronomical and congestion would be so bad the market wouldn't have a choice.  People would find other networks. This happening now, with bitcoin as crippled as it is, would be a godsend to all the altcoins.
And bip101 would start looking a lot more attractive.

I would argue the opposite. they are the fast-lane of development. They can fork without telling anyone for any reason. They can totally destroy a coin and move on. They can experiment with privacy and fail over and over and over and just move on till they get something right.

same way any ponzi scheme works. you put 1000 in and got 1070 back in a week. hell yea, lets repeat. 10000 turns to his 12pct  11200 when he is making you money, and your friends money. Shit is great. And if he successfully closes his business down he will prove to everyone its not a ponzi scheme. or at-least has the capital to cover it.  If he has the money to cover payouts. if he ever started again would have a lot of creditability. 
Although something to think about. This guys is moving probably over a million dollars worth of BTC. Maybe a lot more. If I was getting ready to cash out, I would crash to price of BTC so when I pay them out they are really not making that much money. Bitcoin is so fragile now he might have single handily cut his payouts 33pct. 10btc to USD Vr the 15 is was at.

yes that is why billions are flowing into altcoins. and why lots of great dev's are following.


no the hard part is knowing what things need to get done. And acting accordingly. when you don't have leadership things like bip101 don't get done and devs get forced to rush things like segwit that really shouldn't be rushed.

If 20999999 bitcoins are lost leaving only 1 in extance.  99999999 divisions would exist. 99million dollars can run a small country. Or 1 for every 3 people in usa. If 99pct are lost. The remaining 99999999999999 divisions Thats 99~ trillion or ~9.9 billion for every person on the planet.  people. 
No this conversation is about scarcity. And its place in a healthy economy. Bitcoins have no central bank. Its a fixed rate. Thats the whole point. If banks went around burning cash. And only lent money without fractional reserve lending. The scarcity would make holding saveings lucritive. Rewarding in an expanding econmy.

BTC jam is really interesting. They do there internal credit rateing system, ask borrowers to dox themselves (provide personal info) and even take people court and have legal counsel to do soo all over the globe. There also some crazy rates and while default might be higher then traditional lending there is potential to make a really high margins compaired to tradational lending. A lot of people borrowing have litterally no other avenue to obtain credit and tend to pay high rates.

@_date: 2015-09-10 18:04:40
right, but those tokens only hold value because you agree to redeem it for that value. If you go away, regardless if I have control of the token, it has no value. or at the very least a greatly diminished value.  
And if you continue to service US customers regardless of where you yourselves are located; this service is probably not going to be around long.
This is a very different system then bitcoin,  and having these services side by side in a bitcoin app I feel is dangerous, misguided, and eventually going to lead people who thought they were using bitcoin to get burned.

yes they do. especially any time they even get a whiff of market instability. look at the 2008 run-up.


 
you said: 


I would argue that the capital flows with trust and market sentiment. and  has very little to do with the day to day market making of the government and more to do with faith. Holding fiat IS speculation. No one in Forex is going to tell you what they are doing is not speculation. Its just not amplified day to day enough that people see it. Like the pound is losing value over brexit even though the UK's economy is just as strong as it was 5 years ago. 
Gold is putting faith and speculating in human tradition. Traditionally, over thousands of years, governments have been able to build successful monetary systems around gold. 
And that is how central banks have been so powerful over the ages. Stockpile all the gold, control all the economies. If too much gold gets into the wrong hands just go take it by military force.
so tell me, is gold a ponzi scheme? they have been doing this from 700bc. and it can still be seen today in central banks. gold = money.

@_date: 2016-10-11 03:40:57
Because the Hong Kong agreement outlined doing both 2mb and segwit. While many feel core devs lied when they signed it and really never intended too. This is a guaranty both sides uphold the agreement. (Or neither)
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:27:38
I see no economic incentive for miners to allow that. Miners need to be able to meet demand. But like any resource; as supply goes to infinity revenue goes to 0. There is a market price of what blockspace *should cost and its not 0.


Who would ever in a million years try to do that? you get 15gigs for signing up for email. storage on the internet is insanely cheap from many services.... really?

Miners exist to provide security.

@_date: 2016-10-22 18:36:54

segwit was not written as a capacity increase. And even if everyone on the network started using it tomorrow we would still be far beyond a healthy capacity (most expect this to be years before 70+pct). Its not enough.
That is why core devs and big blockers both agreed we would do BOTH. in the Hong Kong agreement.

you don't mind paying the 6+pct fees?
@_date: 2016-10-15 20:09:10
Again this is not true. If  it was true a non segwit miner could include and steal money from everyone. Then segwit itself would be flawed as there will always be a couple hold out miners who won't upgrade. Only segwit clients can validate. No other client can know if it's valid. That includes miners. Only segwit miners will ever mine a segwit tx because if it was invalid it would be rejected.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:18:10
what percentage of full nodes you think will be running SegWit by then?
Isn't it dangerous to let segwit activate when a majority of nodes still cant validate transactions?
your putting total faith in the miners at that point, and risking all the funds held in segwit. 
Miners delaying segwit could be doing so out of benevolence. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 22:22:20
then why change the agreement? people put a lot of hard work into making that happen.
I know classic and the miners *broke their side of the agreement. But why punish the entire community for something miners did? why not honer the intent of the agreement and bring the community back together?

@_date: 2016-10-22 17:05:20
The premise of my post was 51pct of the miners could steal the money if they wanted. And this is only the case for SegWit held coins.
And the main caveat I'm picking up on is this is only true if full nodes fail to upgrade fast enough.
@_date: 2016-10-27 23:16:15
when you start to prioritize transactions based on motive and not fee you are breaking the p2p nature of bitcoin. And soon you will be policing transactions, and its not that far fetched to think eventually state actors might convince miners to block specific users and coins in whatever mechanisms you build to police spam. 
so again, regardless of motive, all transactions are revenue for the miners. If there are too many transactions, then fees are too low. (or blocksize is too small....)

Any non segwit client ignores all segwit txs. and accepts any segwit tx in a block, even "stolen". So my example is a way to force new SegWit nodes off the current network. And to do this 51pct of miners can steal all SegWit held coins at the same time. The malicious tx will be valid to old nodes, but not the new. So the new would be on the shorter chain if the majority of miners were malicious.

we have less then 30pct on version 13. 


invalid blocks or transactions would be rejected by the network. so the miner would be throwing away money by doing that. The issue with this is that the "new" segwit nodes fork themselves off the network by enforcing rules old nodes do not.

Not entirely true. It doesn't know if they are valid. So it won't relay them. If it doesn't relay it will never get to the miners. And even it it did; if the miners can't validate, so they won't include it. So they are frozen. This is why segwit needs a super Majority of miners to upgrade.

you mean like core did by kicking out Gavin?


And most of current core works for blockstream, OWNED by the banks. so what? bitcoin is an open source project it doesn't matter. 


who got played? what did we play into? the good idea that letting more people use bitcoin is some wild and magical possibility? It doesn't matter who wrote what code, or said what. we as a community can take bitcoin into any future we like. and as long as we have the miners with us we are secure in doing so. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 22:21:10
every single person on earth can run BU, and if the miners never show support there never would be a fork. Running non-core software is not forking. 
and yea it still validates blocks just like core. and if a miner made a block bigger then 1mb without majority support BU will reject it. 
have no idea what you are talking about. we are simply tagging mined blocks with a version number, and only when enough miners show support for it would the nodes; after first warning they are willing to fork; and after x wait-time then, and only then, will they even attempt to fork.

if you worked a support desk for a bitcoin service. The last 48 hours would of been the worse days you ever had. 100x the amount of support tickets you normally would of gotten. And it is mainly people asking about why their transaction hasn't gone through. or why they never received payment from you.
Even services that use fee estimators would have been wrong for large periods of time. And most services don't use RBF. so there is literally nothing they can do besides tell the customer the money might take up to 72 hours before we can rebroadcast a tx with an appropriate fee. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:07:58


my example is a 51pct attack. so by definition a majority of miners are malicious and non segwit. A couple pools could work together and split the rewards. 


would be forked off the network in my example. and my whole point is segwit is dangerous ONLY if a majority of full nodes fail to upgrade.

that is why segwit as a hard fork is a much more prudent method. 
upgrading segwit as a full node is fine. Using segwit, and storing funds in a segwit address prior to the majority of the network upgrading is dangerous for those risking their funds. And if too many do it, its putting a huge payday out for miners who want to go rouge and steal it.  
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:21:34

if 51pct of miners were malicious and included a tx stealing all segwit inputs. All the non-sigwit nodes would still follow that chain. Because to them its valid, and longest.
So 49pct of miners, and segwit nodes would of effectively be hard forked off the network, and would be on an altcoin. 
This is a danger 1. not being told to exchanges and users, as useing segwit before a majority of full nodes is dangerous!. and 2. is monetizing a 51pct attack in a way they it never has been before. This increases danger of an attack! and you should really be telling people this!

@_date: 2016-10-22 16:46:22
So to pull off this attack. Miners prepare and activate SegWit as fast as possible. Hoping they move too fast for full nodes to upgrade too. Encourage some large exchanges to use SegWit. (By shaming them as spammers) While the amount of SegWit nodes are still low a couple pools collude to write code that steals the segwit Bitcoin. And permanently revert to mining the non SegWit fork with this attack. Effectively forking all SegWit nodes and miners off their own network.

a Finney attack is only effective against say an exchange, or a party who accepts a transaction. the attack im talking about is anyone holding funds in a SegWit address.

 the reward currently for an attack is they can double spend exchanges, or censor tx's. So the risk is much lower.
 However, when the reward is a direct theft of x amount of bitcoin. This risk is much higher, and that is my whole point. SegWit is adding risk of a 51pct attack. 
and considering we had a single pool with over 50pct before in the past. And its only a couple of Chinese mining operators that need to get together. Its a real risk.
Especially as a way to force core into forking. If not even for the money, they could do this nullify* block size debate.

They could accept the two weeks of blocks. It's only the malicious spending that will cause the fork. So from that block forward.
@_date: 2016-10-22 17:11:17


In my hypothetical case here. Wouldn't a true hard fork SegWit be safer? By only allowing new nodes to validate SegWit transactions you dont run the risk of miners attempting to steal funds and trick old nodes into letting miners spend Bitcoin by those to whom it doesn't belong.

your right doesn't win anything, I edited that. But it would 1. effectually create bitcoin classic* and they have all the old nodes and stolen funds. And just like we saw with ETH the minority chain can/will still live on.
And core is already talking about changing POW if miners follow unlimited. So both sides are already working on nuclear options.

if consensus was what the handful of core dev's wanted then bitcoin is doomed. The problem is we have 0 diversity in full node implementations the monopoly owners are hostile to any competition. 
That's why they attack anyone trying to do anything without their permission. No one thinks 2mb is dangerous, not even core devs except maybe luke. But that didn't them from making sure agreement insisted that miners not run anything outside of bitcoin core. They are pissed that miners ran non-core software . That is what this is really about. revenge for breaking away from cores code.

say segwit activates. And a bunch of exchanges get guilt tripped into using it right away. (they are spammers right?) 
yet only 20-30pct of full nodes support segwit. All the funds held in SegWit are at risk of theft.
if 51pct of miners were malicious and included a tx stealing all segwit inputs. All the non-sigwit nodes would still follow that chain. Because to them its valid, and longest.
So 49pct of miners, and segwit nodes would of effectively be hard forked off the network, and would be on an altcoin.
This is a danger 1. not being told to exchanges and users, as useing segwit before a majority of full nodes is dangerous!. and 2. is monetizing a 51pct attack in a way they it never has been before. This increases danger of an attack! and you should really be telling people this!

@_date: 2016-10-27 21:38:10
but if there was a hard fork everyone would validate all transactions and then theft would be impossible.
back to my main point, running nodes on bitcoin that don't validate all transactions is dangerous. And if a majority don't validate then we are in danger of the attack I outlined here. 
A hard fork means old nodes cant run on the new fork, and are at 0 risk. 
@_date: 2016-10-11 03:54:00

This is again false, many services still use 0conf and processes high daily volumes on 0conf. and there are many pay services built around judging these 0conf tx's for safety. to this day. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:53:12


if you look at full nodes currently, only 30pct are running version 13. 
And that is the main issue. If a majority of full nodes are pre-SegWit there is a risk; otherwise there is no risk. during this time, 51pct of miners can inject a malicious segwit transaction and that effectively splits the network. To the old nodes both forks are valid and the 51pct chain is longer. And the new forked "altcoin" composed of minority segwit nodes that think longer chain is invalid.
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:07:45
Having two sha256 coins would be a disaster. The fluctuations on mining and attack potential explodes on both sides.
I'm following the miners period. And I can only hope they all stick together and keep us safe. If core wants to fork away from the miners they can have fun building their own infrastructure and altcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-15 16:36:17
No, non segwit clients don't recognize the format. So they can't validate or relay anything. Segwit txs on a non segwit network are essentially frozen.

Actually no, 51pct of miners can not spend without a valid signature, make fake coins bla bla. Invalid blocks are rejected by the network. (Full nodes)

@_date: 2016-10-12 18:20:46
I honestly believe if you just let big blockers post in from the start if would of just fizzled away; or we would of just forked without conflict. it was the conflict you created by making it political that made this whole mess. 


You forced us to leave. you forced a false narrative here. and continue to force your politics down everyone's throat. its why you censored the post about why ViaBTC was doing whats its doing. and its why you continue to censor posts with narratives you don't like.
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:02:34


so why don't we have a bip?


Name any hard measurement for consensus that would get bitcoin-core code to have a hard fork method for activation. Name it, and I guarantee you we can meet it.
People want to fork, but they wont support something unless its core leading it, or at least not fighting agienst it. 
pretending you care about consensus, but fail to define it, then calling it an attack any time nodes/miners/tx's signal support like you have for the last 2 years gets us nowhere and confuses people. 


just write the code and commit it to core. The rest will work itself out.
Don't break your word on this, honor the agreement. show you care more about whats best for bitcoin the miners who did break the agreement. 
Commit the code, make a bip, and ask us if we want to support it. We will run that branch for as long as it takes and signal for it. Nodes, Miners, Marked tx's, whatever you consider "economic nodes". if its actually measurable it will happen before july 2017.

is how you end up with 2 coins. like ETC.

A coin compatible with old clients, and with the same UXTO prior to the split. But they want separate coins, with both on exchanges.

@_date: 2017-05-19 17:43:38


so a little math
The blockchain with Segwit can support about 200 million transactions a year assuming 4,000 transactions per block. Without Segwit it is half this.
Assuming 4txs per YEAR (of channels opening closing) the max users with LN and SegWit is 40million. And that assuming 100pct of all txs are LN and no exchanges or services are operating...
so think about this. currently, as LN is not working yet, and SegWit is not in use. If we defined a bitcoin user as some one with 4tx's per week. 50~ weeks in a year. at only 2000tx in a block. bitcoin is currently limited at only 500,000 users.
WITH segwit that only goes up to 1million users....
and this all assumes there are no businesses operating on bitcoin using more then 4tx's per week. And no miners mining empty blocks.
1mb of non witness data just strangling bitcoin and can not last.

Ah didn't think about nodes. It is true if the majority of nodes upgraded, invalid SegWit txs would just orphan. But as far as I'm aware full nodes do not factor into SegWit activation. Meaning a majority might not be able to validate SegWit txs.
Yea version 13 is only 30pct. And a lot of nodes are on really old versions. 
If core put a 51pct threshold on activation on full nodes it seems to me it would defend against this attack.

And they don't know how to because its complicated, not standardized, subjective and unreliable. And RBF is still not commonly implemented and nor really understood by new users. Services like btms are notorious for using horrible fee's and services like bc.i are just horrible experiences for new users.
The disconnect from this community and businesses and services using bitcoin is horrible. the UX is what is turning people away and holding bitcoin back. its not some new killer app, not some new service, not some pricepoint. bitcoins killer app is money. and to use money you need to be able to handle payments. 


yet people are not pushing hard enough for bigger blocks. its not that complex of math.
A light-moderate bitcoin user needs ~4tx a week.
4000 tx's in a block, 200 million tx's in a year.
50 weeks in the year * 4txs = 200 tx's per user per year.
that means we are capped at 1 million users..... and that is WITH SEGWIT.
and these numbers assume no multi-sig (as they are larger) and 100pct adoption of segwit.
we cant keep going like this, not even with full LN adoption.

Everyone still waits, and when you run out the person who is next at the counter and was waiting the whole time gets fucked. He has to wait an hour because you already took his money. When asking for a refund you point to a sign that says 72hours for returns or you must write rbf on the bills.
Now your getting the most possible money for your 10 cups. But your customers are pissed. They have no idea how long it's going to take to get coffee. Some who gave you money forgot to write rbf on it. So they can't raise their bid. They are stuck waiting while others can jump in front of them. Wandering aimlessly for hours waiting for coffee.
 Your soup nazi antics might work for the coffee addicts that love your coffee. but you would make much more money lobbying for permission to sell more then 10 an hour and setting a single price.

Chain split != Hard fork. But they have similar results.

Nodes follow the longest VALID chain.
SegWit is a set of NEW rules.
If miners dont follow segwit then too old nodes BOTH are valid chains. And they will follow the longest.
To segwit nodes only one is valid, creating a chain split. and NON segwit is true bitcoin and UASF nodes are a fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:18:41

1. Yet that retargeting is in 2000 blocks. The high volume because of turmoil and two weeks of backlogs is insane. And expecting any kind of meaningfull SegWit tx adoption instantly is wishful thinking.
2. Antbleed is OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, it's already patched. And a total joke how rediculas this sub got. It's the closed source mining software on everyone's else we need to worry about more.
3. If BU was copy paste it would not of had any errors. It's the thinblocks and other new experimental stuff they rushed out. 
4. Tell that to the ETC miners.
I've found when betting on action and inaction in the tech space I'll always take the former. That's why things like XP are still on half the world's computers, banks run cobal. Bitcoin still has 1mb blocks...
34pct of miners signal SegWit right now. But how many are committing to UASF????? Those SegWit miners will keep following the longest chain as long as there are no invalid segwit txs in it. 
I have no idea what is going to happen with UASF. But I'm recommending those I work with to NOT run uasf. And too shut down commerce until a winner is found. Unless they are willing to do the work to support both chains.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:31:42
bcoin actually does a much better job at managing UXTO's in memory and most large exchanges and services are forced away from core because its incapable of managing a wallet with larger than 300k keys. This is why many have been pushing to break apart the full node and wallet code. 
but regardless. my point is the opposite, having a single maintain set of consensus code and a strong devolpment community that is responsive to the needs of the network is how we maintain a healthy economy. there is nothing healthy about what is going on in bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:45:02
This sub can't seem to understand why they are doing what they are.

is it pathetic and sad we had core devs begging to do this 5 years ago to prevent the issue we have now? yes.
Does that mean we have to accept that we are stuck being incapable of supporting our userbase? absolutely not. 
HF is going to happen, mitigating how much damage it causes, and how many get left behind is all that matters now. people can fight it, drag this out into the markets with a chain split. Or we can keep some dignity and follow the most strait forward path we can find. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:11:41
dude, txs larger then 100k are already non standard and not relayed. so a soft fork to limit them to 500k is not a big deal.

But that does not help spoofing the customers number. the point of attack for this kinda of service.

max profit for the miners. You don't meet total aggregate demand because that would be lnefficiant. Markets don't like lnefficiant. The goal is to increase supply until they reach equilibrium. 
artificially capping supply is just as bad (or arguably worse) then price fixing. In a true market both price and supply will be market determined. And equilibrium will be reached along with max efficiency. turning into max revenue from mining rewards.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 00:07:54

He doesn't own the hardware asshole. He sells its. 
Its the pools who make the decision, and if the thousands and thousands of miners don't agree with the pool they are fee to move to a SegWit/core pool. and vice versa.

2mb of non-witness data is not throwing anything away. Its the fastest path to get SegWit. The more users we get the more businesses will follow. the more businesses the more nodes, the more nodes the more decentralized and resilient the network it. The more secure the network is the more capital will flow to it and will raise the price. 


Bitcoin is not a Democracy. we do not have representatives, and USERS CAN NOT VOTE FOR CHANGE. 
Bitcoin is a protocol, and protocols are defined and participated in. they are voluntary and not voted on. People can build a new protocol, but can not force people into it. regardless of what people vote for.

That is not how bitcoin works, we are all peers. you cant control it with hashpower. 


It matters less who produces the hardware and matter more who OWNS AND OPERATES that hardware. Bitmain DOES NOT OWN ALL ITS HARDWARE. they sell it. They don't control what people do with its hardware. Its even arguable he has any control over Antpool if the miners who point to that pool didn't want BU they would leave that pool.

Getting a definition of this is what we need. because as soon as we can agree on a definition we can reach it for bigger blocks. 
Right now the only way we can measure support for big blocks are miners. as all other methods are vulnerable to Sybil attacks.

Realese the code with an optional flag to signal readyness and optional condition that allows 2mb of non witness data.
Just put the code in a release and you can even tell people not to ever do use it. And go around begging people not too.

totally predicted exactly what is going on now.


investors yes, users no. I would argue the opposite. As much exploding merchant growth that bitcoin used to pride itself on is now nonexistent. Services like bitpay are stagnant. Large businesses are all waiting for scaling.  the amount of overhead and customer support for a large business to accept bitcoin is such a burden it is very rare nowadays for anyone large to begin accepting.
and the growth of bitcoin is totally eclipsed by the growth of the altcoin markets. with daily volumes reaching billions.


no one of any importance is saying that. even your scapegoat Roger that everyone here likes to turn into the evil villain is not saying that. 


was totally an accurate prediction of what bitcoin has become. It is impossible to predict fee's, and the race to the top for any resemblance of reliability by businesses has created a totally unstable fee market for normal users.


is also a true prediction, hard forking is stronger now then ever.
But my entire point of this post is **The need for hard forking has never left, it was predicted 5 years ago. The message has not changed, the goal has not changed. the only change is now we have 80pct of the mining power and businesses worth billions of daily transaction volumes behind us**

if you read that you would realize that we cant support 40million. That is assuming all users, Exchanges can not operate on less then 2txs a year. not everyone can be forced to use LN. the real number is much much lower, and probably under what coinbase has now. 
we cant support our current base now, much less grow. So until we get larger blocks there is NO tech around or thought of that will solve* or even dramatically help anything. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 07:39:01
ah, So I'm not considering this have any effect on what tx's are mined. In that that would lead to censorship and be really bad. But as a better way to signal what the economic majority supports. Allowing economic nodes flag readiness to for larger blocks. 
The only users who can signal readiness now are miners. However this sub seems to think miners are poor representation of the economy. And I don't entirely disagree with that.

@_date: 2016-10-27 21:12:24
? no only miners as they took the money. Exchanges can be on either side of the fork it doesn't matter. one side they lost money and was stolen from, the other is segwit.
My whole point is its best to wait till the majority of full nodes are on segwit. and if full nodes dont upgrade its safer to for the honest miners to NOT activate segwit. and all in all segwit would be much safer if done as a hard fork. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 17:26:25


Fuck that, we follow the miners. period. The only one here talking about changing POW is core; under the context if the miners left core and supported the fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:39:52
so a little math
The blockchain with Segwit can support about 200 million transactions a year assuming 4,000 transactions per block. Without Segwit it is half this.
Assuming 4txs per YEAR (of channels opening closing) the max users with LN and SegWit is 40million. And that assuming 100pct of all txs are LN and no exchanges or services are operating...
so think about this. currently, as LN is not working yet, and SegWit is not in use. If we defined a bitcoin user as some one with 4tx's per week. 50~ weeks in a year. at only 2000tx in a block. bitcoin is currently limited at only 500,000 users.
WITH segwit that only goes up to 1million users....
and this all assumes there are no businesses operating on bitcoin using more then 4tx's per week. And no miners mining empty blocks.
1mb of non witness data just strangling bitcoin and can not last. 
SegWIt is good, but 


is totally wrong, and by itself it cant support more then 1 million users, and even with LN we still don't scale to even a snapchat level of use. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:24:14
so what altcoin do we need to pump to show bigger blocks are the way forward?

yes do this. And the best way to do that is increase the size of the network and increase the value of such a service. 
To do that we need big blocks 3 years ago. when we saw this coming. So we can keep growing while new tech is made. instead of forcing users into altcoins. 


so lets get SegWit fast and do with WITH the miners like litecoin did by agreeing to bigger blocks as well. and not dick around for 3 more years of fighting with ourselves. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:09:23
if the majority of miners are incapable to validating segwit tx's. All it takes is one invalid tx to be mined and both networks will be split. To an old node BOTH are valid chains, and the majority of miners with the invalid tx is the longest. meaning it will follow the wrong chain. and segwit nodes/miners will fork themselves off the main network. 
I have some really really long threads on here talking about this in detail about a month ago perhaps I can find it.

better question is why not?
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:24:24
No it does not. barely tens of millions.




it scales better on litecoin because they have a 5x faster blocktimes and let there chain bloat 5x faster. as well as the fact they already agreed to larger blocks to get segwit in the first place (something we need to do asap).

There is no way to measure this unless both coins get added to an exchange. 
Exchanges are very keen to WANT to do this, as they will collect fees on all the trades.
And while this is happening nodes on the wrong side of the split will be doing commerce and have huge potential loss! Exchanges that don't enact replay protections will have lost coin. Users that dont use replay protection might accidentally send money on both chains. The software to split bitcoin doesn't exist publicly or in any well tested way. And those who wrote it for exchanges are using primitive fee levels magic to support both chains on the exchange.


A reorg will never happen on exchanges, or any informed user. It is completely trivial for any users to run invalidate-block, and miners/exchanges will be extremely keen to do this as accidentally being on the wrong chain both ways is something they are extremely sensitive too. 
If there is a community that wants to not follow UASF there will be a coin, there will be exchanges, and there will be software that deals with replays as exchanges already had to write this software during the BU runup.




Is a total *dangerous* lie. The network will be split, and if UASF really doesn't have consensus. Because activation is NOT DEPENDENT on consensus. Running it without consensus you have the risk of being on the wrong chain as the rest of the economy. That is a major risk to any user doing commerce on bitcoin at the time.
so not an issue for devs like luke-jr who don't actually use bitcoin; but exchanges that he is now giving BAD ADVICE too. Exactly like the ETH foundation gave to exchanges during the ETH/ETC split. Don't worry about replay attacks, Don't worry about upgrading. Just throw away all the coin on the other chain it's not worth anything. who cares if the money you are throwing away doesn't belong to you.... (cough cough coinbase)
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:21:41
The problem is old nodes will follow the longest chain and if actual economic activity is happening it's disastrous to fork like that.

Then you are asking for a chain split. And are just as reckless as the HF people. In fact more so because we waited 4 years to get consensus in hash rate. But you want to go now.

The issues with reliability, cost and congestion were predicted exactly. There are no revisions. 


2mb, and the solutions proposed during the HK agreement, and again with Barry recently are rational and proportional to the needs of the network. 
They are actually acknowledging the extent of the problem and not pretending that .7mb of additional capacity is going to get us to where we need to be. And thinking that LN will have any reasonable effect is total pie in the sky unreasonable thinking. 
refusing to work with us and keeping your head in the sand is continuing to hold back bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:35:15

Jihan is not what is blocking segwit. only 30pct of miners are supporting segwit. He is simply a scapegoat for this sub. He does not control all his hardware he sells it. it's the users that are choosing not to run SegWit. And it's the lack of better choices that is leaving us where we are. 
This sub needs to stop blaming others for it's own shortcomings.

miners first ran classic because Austin Hill, at the time president of blockstream went into the negotiations under the title of president. after after they were concluded refused to sign as president and wanted it to be re-printed as individual. Miners wanted, and went under the context that BOTH core can blockstream be represented. The lack of communication resulted in neither sticking to that. 
Miners refused, and the next day F2Pool ran classic.

It is much more risky to be on UASF, during a failed attempt, then on an old node. The risks are not equal.

the majority of bussiness and bitcoin holders are sick and tired a small minority of devs letting perfect get in the way of good. You are turning away customers and economic activity in the billions in the false name of centralization. The economic majority want SegWit, and they ALSO want bigger blocks.
if you define a bitcoin user as some one using bitcoin just 4 times a week we are capped at 1 million users. and that is WITH SEGWIT. this stranglehold over bitcoin will not last, 1mb of non witness data will not last. We have waited 4 years now. we have the majority of mining power, and its just a manner of time before we figure out the best way to move ahead together with the users/services and leave you fundamentalists behind.

@_date: 2017-05-19 07:27:40


You're like a child trying to understand the real world and live  in some fantasy of how you think adults act.
This is not how it works. Mining companies have investors. Electricity, hardware, wages, bribes, insurance, everything is planned out years in advance in the companies burn rate. All the proceeds stay in the company and become collateral to borrow more money. The higher Bitcoin price goes the more collateral. The more collateral the more investment. The more investment the higher the valuation. The higher the valuation the more money for the board.
At no point does Bitcoin get sold monthly, bank wires sent, checks cashed to pay for electricity. (Or Bitcoin paid for electricity LMFAO)


Exchanges Will not play politics for you. These are not not school yard bullies you can convince to back you up to beat up Jimmy for hurting your feelings. these are cutthroat businesses that are ran for profit and bottom lines.

sure, but if super majority of miners don't upgrade, setwit tx's wont confirm as fast. (as only segwit miners can include them) if its too few miners or they get unlucky they can be frozen for long times. If we soft-fork, then go back on that soft-fork (ie hard fork to BU without segwit) segwit tx's will never get relayed or mined and they are all frozen.

not really, bitcoin is voluntary. so nothing is stopping BU from forking at any moment. and user can voluntarily associate with them and follow.  however if they want to "win" then they want the majority to follow.
But most people understand at this point the markets are going to have to decide the final result and both coins are going to exist at some point. 
They just want enough mining power to follow so that the weak side is pretty much worthless.

Bullshit. they are making less money with small blocks.
In order for miners to survive they need more revenue as the block rewards dwindle. If they don't get bigger blocks users are going to need to be spending thousands of dollars per transaction to keep miners afloat, or we need thousands more transactions to fit into a block.

I'm 100Pct sure you would have the same issues with bitpay.
there is basically no competition in this space. so its completely understandable that they have 0 reason to attempt to service you. Any customers that have even the slightness chance of getting any additional attention from regulators are getting the boot. They wont service you because they don't have to compete. They know you aren't going to go to some one else because you cant. they don't care what you have to say because they don't have to compete with anyone.

So this still requires miners stop running BU in order to protect themselves from invalid segwit tx's.
so It does nothing to help a UASF. or protecting old nodes from an UASF

Is a lie. Pools are made up of thousands of individual miners. and there are many pools. Miners who do not support BU could just as easily move to a new pool. just because one manufacturer is clearly dominating the market doesn't mean he has control  over what people do with his hardware. You are looking for an enemy and projecting your frustrations at a scapegoat. Antminers are sold to the general public. The public is not choosing to run your software. Make your product better, or listen to why they arnt running it, or just get over it. 


You have no solid evidence of this. and even if you did, you cant progress until the division in the community is over. because its big, and pretending doesnt exist is just killing your credibility.

Nothing about big blocks changes this.
in fact, staying on the weak side of a fork you are going to have problems keeping censorship-resistance.

False, full nodes check the signatures of the entire chain, always. 
what you are describing is slightly more then a SPV node. And this is NOT secure enough for commerce on bitcoin.
SPV nodes are only useful for consumers who are spending, NOT for receiving payment from untrusted sources.

The customer owns an account valued in bitcoin. The user does not own any bitcoin, they own an account.
because ownership by definition must include possession.  
" To have or possess as property"
"To have control over"
Circle makes no such acknowledgement, they use a hotwallet and do not hold specific coins for specific users. You do not get the sames coins you put in. You trade your coins for an account denominated in bitcoin. you trade funds in that account for actual bitcoin when you withdrawal.

miners, core and users working together IS the only path forward. Everything else leads to gridlock. This is the spirit of the HK agreement. This is the same spirit that got litecoin segwit.

is not true. When we get more accurate levels of true node counts we get numbers in the 50k plus.

It even proves this ability by decrypting some random files.
Source code of some older variants are available to researchers. And it's possible a master key leaks at some point like others have.
Edit: However this software is poorly made. Other instances would create a separate address per infection to detect payment. But in this case they want you to contact them.
And after looking at more info there isn't any examples of wannacry actually decrypting.

I disagree, I have never met a single person who turned off a node because of bandwith, and many altcoins like ETH have much much higher bandwidth costs. And the extra users would result in MORE nodes overall as businesses spring up to serve those users.
This can be demonstrated in the fact ETH has MORE full nodes then bitcoin, despite MUCH MUCH higher bandwidth requirements.

because we don't have enough users to need this. and im not claiming there isnt a limit. Im saying the modest increases being proposed would result in MORE nodes. not less. that is the MYTH of the dangerous 2mb of non witness data the HK agreement called for.
The blockchain with Segwit can support about 200 million transactions a year assuming 4,000 transactions per block. Without Segwit it is half this.
Assuming 4txs per YEAR (of channels opening closing) the max users with LN and SegWit is 40million. And that assuming 100pct of all txs are LN and no exchanges or services are operating...
so think about this. currently, as LN is not working yet, and SegWit is not in use. If we defined a bitcoin user as some one with 4tx's per week. 50~ weeks in a year. at only 2000tx in a block. bitcoin is currently limited at only 500,000 users!!!!
WITH segwit that only goes up to 1million users....
and this all assumes there are no businesses operating on bitcoin using more then 4tx's per week. And no miners mining empty blocks.
1mb of non witness data just strangling bitcoin and can not last. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:29:00
and then how can you claim consensus when only 40~ of blocks signal SegWit?
UASF without consensus is just a chain split and just as dangerous.

1. you don't share a ledger unless the buyer intends to reconfigure.
2. you could save an encrypted wallet on a hard drive then tell the user the password when they receive it.
but finally,


your missing the point. the receiver will have complete control but SO WILL YOU.
so no, there is absolutely no way to do this sadly and prove you don't also have accesses to it.
the user needs to make an address and you need to send to it.

I'm in this community, and post mostly in because i've been here over 5 years now. 
Despite a few blips ive mostly been allowed to post as I like here. I'm glad its this way, and I feel eventually the rift will end. I think this because every time it comes to the root of issues with big blocks core devs are actually supportive. they just lack leadership to refuse to lead in the fork. But the people opposed to 2mb of non-witness data as called for in the HK agreement is shrinking over time. A lot of that has to do with core software getting improvement after improvement to support the larger blocks and the realization that the majority of business are desperate for a better UX in bitcoin.  


as a staunch champion of open source software the closed nature of asicboost is sad to see. But totally mainstream and traditional approach to running a business with patents and closed architecture is not surprising in the slightest.
however, any advancement that improves the performance of bitcoin miners makes us as a network more secure. So yes I support asicboost, just as I would support open-sourcing asicboot so the rest the network could also secure our network better. 
When avalon released the first asics yifu had over 50pct of the entire bitcoin network on a single wafer. And the profits he made from the first batch pushed the security of our network to a level out of reach of even the most resourceful adversaries.
Its this championing of new tech that breaks barriers into increasing the security and long term survivability of bitcoin.  Its ignorant statements like lets change POW and attacks on bitmain who are the ONLY manufacturer to sell to individuals and use open source software that gives me pause on the future of bitcoin.

Your tx fees are exceding 3usd+. So your use case (low value) results in 100pct+ in fees. Priced out means no longer viable.

No miners can not force the network to larger blocks, otherwise we would of had larger blocks 5 years ago. That is why we need economic participation to fork. 


They would profit more from MORE fees in a block. In fact this is crucial the survival of miners completely, as mining rewards continue to dwindle that will start to become their only source of income. and there is only so much a user is willing to pay for a TX fee before going to a new chain. This is like if the government came in and said starbucks can only sell 10 coffees an hour. Sure they might be able to start selling coffees at 20$ a pop and people would pay it. But the chain would go out of business.

Securities are regulated by the SEC. there are actually a lot more people going to jail for unlicensed securities then unlicensed money transmission.
Because Bitcoin has the ability to transmit. FINCEN takes the leap that just selling the assets is enabling money transmission. So they are asking the states to prosecute via their guidance. (There are 0 federal laws regulating money transmission)
Also, its worth correcting. A money service business can apply for a money transmitter license, but not all MSB's need MTL's. And just being a local fiat-&gt;fiat business is different because fait can't transfer itself; unlike *virtual convertible currencies as FINCEN defines.

because it was terms they would agree too. And they would still agree to these terms. If we meet them in good faith we can get segwit. If we fight we wont get anything for a long time and could potential cost bitcoin users tons of money in a catastrophic chain split.

estimator is just that, estimation. The problem is its a blind auction. You can out bid, and the goalposts can move insanely fast. Having a system where an estimator can be wrong, and your average wait time could be between 10min to 6 hours is a broken and horrible UX.
Prices need to float with the market, but this is totally sad if this is the best we can do. If we had more space, we could smooth out this volatility. 0.7 more mb is going to help... a little. But I wouldn't fire any of my support staff at an exchange any time soon.

Nodes != Users. Most users are on SPV or proxy TXS through a 3rd party. Only merchants need to verify payments from untrusted sources.
Tx fees limit users, blocksize limit users.

Basic economics. Capping supply is not how you reach max profit. They would make far more money by meeting demand with larger blocks. That is why miners have been demanding larger blocks for 5 years. because their own survival is at stake as mining rewards dwindle. That is why they refuse to accept just SegWit, as it is not enough to meet demand. and if they allow it, it will just delay larger blocks, and the larger bitcoin gets the harder it is to hard for to larger blocks. 


The congestion was predicted. 5 years ago there was a push to fix it. and people ignored it and instead put their heads in the sand and pretend it would never come to pass.
it did.

if things don't change its going to result in a division in the community. There are people on both sides that want a hard fork and want to split the development community.
I am not one of them. 
Refusing to allow consensus changes into core IS going to be cause of that split. Its making to community diverge with the software repo.

If they don't have a vote how are they blocking SegWit?
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:33:58
UASF is just as dangerous has a HF. and there is no way to measure consensus for a UASF. and if you ever defined consensus well enough to do it, us, the large blockers would reach it for large blocks first before you. You maximalists are in the minority and have been holding us hostage this whole time by abusing your positions of power over the software cycle.

They don't want to fire core. They want core to make software that supports their needs.  Bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:11:55
It is the job of the market to decide the pricing. That requires the ability to adjust supply. The size must be kept in check by the network, but artificially setting the block size is central planning, and like all historical examples leads to shortages and instability. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:31:52
I like to think of it like a 3rd world country. 
Its a reverse auction where the government official generally serves the highest bribe. However there is never an advertised amount that is guaranteed to get you service. Its whatever the curropt official is feeling at the time, and he can choose to do nothing (mining empty blocks) and if your in the *know or have friends that are government officials you can get by spending less (tx accelerators, miner partnership like the self address spammer and bitfury)
also, if your associated with a big fish government officials might let your small bribe get combined with the large. (child pays for parent) and get rushed to the front. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:25:59
the split started when the users in this sub wanted to promote clients core didn't approve of. They were forced to leave this sub or be banned. 
very similar to the UASF trolls promoting their clients that break consensus. Core wont merge their code so they feel the only way to get people to run it is spamming this sub. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:42:07
Well originally Gavin wanted 20. Then 8. Then both sides sat down at the HK agreement and agreed to 4mb equiliviant capacity and 2mb of non witness data.

if 148 and segwit2x do not have consensus they will not succeed. and running that software will result in loss of funds. that is true for both clients. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:30:10
YES!!! wtf man, you are endangering people by telling them lies. If you accept bitcoin as payment during the split you may potentially be accepting bitcoin on the wrong chain!!!! even the average joe MUST be aware of this. Old code is NOT safe. 
THAT IS LOST BITCOIN!!!
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:14:05
because if the majority of miners are not on segwit they can NOT validate them, but they will still accept them. and if the majority accept an invalid segwit tx (say one stealing all the segwit funds) then the majority of miners will keep building on that chain. and old nodes will follow that chain.
The end result would be segwit nodes forked off the main chain, and all the users of it have stolen funds. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:55:54
I propose 2mb of non witness data, as was called for by the HK agreement. and was signed by Jihan himself as well as *some core devs with support for SegWit with a flag day.

@_date: 2017-05-11 22:32:56


No it really isn't, At this point 2mb of non witness data is widely agreed to as safe. The only contention is the act of the HF itself. And that is a political decision.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:00:09
From everything i've observed miners are not opposed to SegWit. They are just terrified that if they activate it first that it will take years for a real blocksize increase and cost them potentially billions. I honestly believe if the software was released by core to signal this the response from the community will be very clear in support on BOTH sides. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:07:12
And yet it is you asking for something from the miners. When they told you it's a non starter to not release the code for a HF.

I didn't say that. And that is not what big blockers are pushing for. they are pushing for 2mb of non witness data.

@_date: 2017-05-29 07:59:37
That agreement is 82pct of the hashpower. You can pretend that there is no options in your little fantasy world, but the economic majority and the mining majority just agreed to hard fork. 
5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume
and 20.1 million bitcoin users.
UASF has 0 miners, and 230k subscribers in a reddit. And many of whom totally hate what this sub has become and are just annoyed at all your UASF bullshit anyway. You best make a bunch more UASF posts, sure that will get the rest of the network on your side.

They should make these decisions configurable inside the client. and let the community flag and signal, not force them into other repos like XT, classic and BU.
There is a reason Gavin was forced out of core despite being one the largest contributors. He wanted to give people the choice and the other devs wanted to use their leverage for political decisions.

And a massive massive altcoin community that is exploding and has more trading volume then bitcoin already today.


no, that is not how bitcoin works. 


before bitcoin there was nothing like it to compare with.


I've been in bitcoin for 7 years. And I understand the power of the network effect, and why the larger the community the better the security model. Bitcoin is meant to challenge central banks and banking cartels, not some toy only a few can use. It was never meant to be held back because of artificial constants that have nothing to do with technical capacity of the network. and every minute we delay removing that constant gets harder and harder and more likely to cause financial losses when we do.

this war is much much older then that. Many say the war got real when blockstream backing out of the HK agreement and miners started running classic. But the intellectual war goes back to Gavin predicting the backlog 4 years ago and pushing for a hard fork to prevent it. 


That all the major players are ready, and have been ready for a solution for years. So it really is not far fetched at all that people will run non-core software as UASF or segwit2x. They have been begging for it, waiting for the right time.

the bottleneck in the amount of node is NOT bandwidth. its the size of the userbase and businesses to service them. 
Keeping blocks small will do nothing to stymie user growth, and that will result in less nodes. So if you want more nodes you need bigger blocks. And as long as we keep fees high, we should keep expanding these blocks to keep up with demand.

its already built, you can thank UASF for that. As it was deemed service critical. it will work just like ETH/ETC exchanges will list both, and any coin sent in will automatically get split. Exchanges that don't protect will get exploited quickly simply by users sending from one exchange to the other.


 
they plan on letting users support both. 


keep acting like the ETH foundation and trying to trick people into thinking listing both coins is impossible. It will be done, and once that happens all the rest will have to follow suit or potentially loose customer funds like coinbase did. 
luckily all the major exchanges already learned this, and are already prepared.

The safest path is one of unity. SegWit and 2mb of non witness data activated by flag day at the same time. 


The best way to stop the blocking of segwit is for core to release code that is capable of signaling large blocks. That way miners can signal big blocks AND run segwit without running BU.

@_date: 2017-07-06 22:32:51


if that were true it would be in core. That is polling there opinions on the whether or not 148 should be merged. Not polling if they feel users should run software not compatible with core. 
There is a reason why promotion of software that changes the protocol needs consensus. and promotion of that software without consensus to those who don't understand this is dangerous. And the only core dev insane enough to do so is luke-jr. 
and as the warnings from other core devs have pointed out, doing so is against core's wishes.

I am willing to push away users to prevent a split in community, yes. Otherwise we would have forked bitcoin long ago. the goal is a successful coin, it always was and will always continue to be. 


we are not manipulating anything. We are patiently trying to successfully grow and build bitcoin into a successful tool for a large community. Not some tiny toy incapable of supporting its growing userbase with fee's being artificially limited by central planning and no basis in the free market value of the services it provides or the technical capacity of the network.

most exchanges already do this, and i've had to write code for it. Core is unable to accurately predict fees enough for an exchange, and even with my own magic I get it wrong sometimes. so I ended up having to write it anyway.
We even do this for customers that send inputs with to little fee. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:29:15

We should provide the tools to scale to the current userbase and not allow development to get in the way of growth. 


For those 500k users yea its working fine.


never said that.


competing technology is cheaper, and we are giving up marketshare to them every single day we fail to work together.

Because a chain split with UASF is just as dangerous as a hard fork. As in both cases merchants and users who fail to upgrade will on doing commerce on the wrong chain. Can risk loosing millions in commerce, and because of the shit show could very easily end up with 2 coins calling themselves bitcoin on exchanges. 
and in fact, following the rules set by BU. the UASF side of the fork would not be called bitcoin because it is the new chain. As old nodes will still follow the longest valid chain, and they are the true bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:46:43
then you should be asking for miner support not making up lies and propagandized hate speech against them. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:23:57


I disagree with that statement. More users = more merchants = more capital avaible to maintain nodes. 


Blocks are always full. the issue is fee level, and the userbase. The goal to allow the userbase to continue to grow and utilize the resources available to provide them affordable fees. 


You also build support for when superior technologies release to streamline utilization of them.  Bitcoin needs to be able to utilize increased bandwidth as the tech becomes available worldwide.


 
lol, you dont see the irony in this? why not HF in unity to support our base instead of being children that would rather get their own way then admit they are wrong. (and doing exactly what the argument was about in the first place to get their way)


If UASF is about letting crying children get their way by simply being willing to break the nice bicycle given to them instead of sharing it because they cant agree on the upgrades. then sure, have fun. 
the adults will work in industry standards groups and find the best way service the businesses and miners in the way that expands the system. Allowing tools for as many of its users get serviced adequately to the best of our ability in the most pragmatic way possible.  
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:48:11


There was never a HF release, it was never recommended by core, much less done 3 months after releasing SegWit. 
And it wasn't the miners that broke it, the miners felt it was never ratified by blockstream from the start. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:51:59


I really don't understand how this is tolerated This is worse then big blockers ever did. It is one thing to promote dangerous software that could result in catastrophic loss of funds. **But to do so while at the same time refusing to admit the risks** is just a total abuse of the medium. And to do so under the guise of implied credibility of a core dev. Some one needs to correct these statements. Protocol changes without consensus are dangerous, everyone on both sides of this debate agree with that.

every one of those are working with segwit2x. As well as spliting coins, and dealing with forks. 
That statement was related to BU and is dated. It is unclear what exchanges will list 2x under. what is clear is the weak 1x side could have a mere 20pct of miners, and possible a lot less. so any exchange wishing to support it would need 48+blocks on a deposits to be secure from double spends. and with blocktimes much much longer then normal on top of that people are going to be pissed trying to use the weak side.

 I honestly believe the terms of the HK agreement will still be accepted by miners. Just supporting/releasing (as in an actual release!) the code for 2mb of non witness data is all it would take to get the vast majority of miners and Jihan himself to drop BU and signal segwit. This is by what he has said, and the overall sentiment of the big blocker community.

big blockers don't want control, nor do we want centralization. We want to be able to grow and support our userbase with practical fee's and prefer a direct and pragmatic approach to do so. 


I do, but I care more about utility, health and reputation, then price.


yes, yes it can. If it fails to get enough miners to activate segwit before the expiration time it will fail to get segwit. failing to achieve its goal. (about 15pct)
And if it fails to make 5pct it is possible block times will be so slow that the likelihood of it reaching a re-target in our lifetimes remains in question. having 0 utility to users. 
I also consider it a failure if there is catastrophic financial loss by any non trivial amount of users/services that permanently damage the reputation of bitcoin in general.

That has been done repeatedly over the last 3 years. It is being blocked, and there are only 5 people on earth with control over the github of core. 
That is why we forked and went to XT, then classic, then BU.
Core wont allow 3rd parties to make the code. therefore the HK agreement was about core devs making the code themselves. 
but again they refused to follow through and get it into a release.


its already done. 
and is a tiny patch compatible with all versions of core. 
The bitcoin-dev email list has been talking about getting it into a release as an optional flag. However they are still stalemating it. and forcing big blockers to run non-core code.

omg no, that is so wrong on so many levels. And if people did that the potential for total catastrophic failure of segwit is a very high possibility. 


But they didnt release it. So they need to keep working till its in a release. untill then miners wont run SegWit. That is what the document says, and that is what they are doing.

You are talking yourself in circles. It won't be profitable without miners, so miners won't move to it untill it's profitable.
It takes 100 blocks before rewards can even be redeemed. Why would they risk mining on something that would take 100 days before they could even sell? When it's unsure the chain would even survive that long?
There is a clear threshold of mining power needed for survival. If it is not met the coin can not function.
It's debatable what that is but in my opinion it is around 20pct.

the second we move away from the network we are instantly insecure and exposed to attack from any source. it is impossible to secure a network this large without asics. It is impossible to start over on new asics without exposing us from attack in the short term. It is impossible to secure a network long term without continual exponential growth of asics.

we should push away as many users as it takes to move together as a community in unity to a solution without causing catastrophic damage. I believe with 85pct+ of miners and vast majority of businesses on board with segwit2x we are almost there now. And if successful it was worth the wait.

wanting a change to get into core is different from wanting people to run code that is not core. I think many devs want 148 into core. But that does not mean they want people running non-core code. as doing so is dangerous and a slippery slope.

then you should invest in the infrastructural and control some miners and show support for it. because as of now it is less then 1pct. And without miners there is no way it is going to succeed. because this current mindset that you can threaten and force miners to your own will is just plain wrong. Threatening economic damage if they don't follow is violence, and it is counter to everything bitcoin is about. and as an old timer in bitcoin you should know that.

So discounting witness data is still data sent, it is still bandwith on the network, it is still validation every single node on the network needs to do. It is unfair because it is all these things yet cheaper in fee's. Meaning spammers can spam on a much cheaper cost per kb of spam.

is an absolutely ridiculous statement. And it baffles me such ignorance can exist in this sub. no miners = no coin end of fucking story. 


I'm in the development groups working with the beta software. I assure you devs from every one of those are working with us. (except btce they never talk to anyone)
it is clear what the industry is doing. you just have to get your head out of the sand and ask them. 
Is it possible we end with two coins on all these exchanges because of fools? sure, but after there will be a clear winner, and that winner will be named bitcoin when all is settled and done. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:50:18
the price goes to infinty... quickly. 
so yes they cant afford infinity. 


does not work like that. as every single spike in bitcoin has shown, liquidity dries up fast during every spike. 
so again, this is the best possible outcome for bitcoiners possible. absolute best.

well if they handle it like the ETH/ETC fork they plan on mismanaging tons of customer money and throwing away coin and later having to go to the market to replace it.
However its worth mentioning that they did eventually handle both sides and let users withdrawal the *losing coin. 
With bitcoin I could see the same thing. They will pick the winner, only support that coin and allow users to withdrawal the other side once.

14pct of hashpower on a coin is near impossible to use. crazy long blocktimes, exchanges will need to wait 100+ confirms to be safe on deposits because of double spends. Meaning moving money into/out of exchanges will take weeks per tx. Not to mention the ablity for miners to come mine empty blocks and fuck with you.

The innovation and research done with altcoins is invaluable to bitcoin. Where do you think segwit came from? Pioneered and studied with bitshares. The DAO debacle shows dangers and lessons learned when applying smart contracts on bitcoin. bitcoin is the end game, but altcoins are the laboratory. 
This anti-altcoin; altcoins are all scum scammers and should just go away mindset is just silly. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:02:05
full node isn't a requirement to use bitcoin. It is a security benchmark, and requirement for merchants, NOT consumers/users.  and yes bigger blocks means more people can use bitcoin. As right now, if you call a user making 4tx's a week. bitcoin can only support 500,000 users. the last 4 years we have been pushing to stop turning users away and stop forcing people into altcoins because we are incapable of supporting our own growth without larger blocks. Not with SegWit, not with LN, nor any other future tech can we sustain our current growth. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:15:09


if 148 has consensus then core will automatically follow it, and will not need to change or do anything different. 
Core follows the longest valid chain, therefore, because segwit is valid in core, it will follow a chain that 148 activated.
however, if it does not have consensus and it is not the longest chain it will never be true bitcoin nor will core ever follow it.

@_date: 2017-05-06 22:19:47


then you are a big blocker.
so a little math
The blockchain with Segwit can support about 200 million transactions a year assuming 4,000 transactions per block. Without Segwit it is half this.
Assuming 4txs per YEAR (of channels opening closing) the max users with LN and SegWit is 40million. And that assuming 100pct of all txs are LN and no exchanges or services are operating...
so think about this. currently, as LN is not working yet, and SegWit is not in use. If we defined a bitcoin user as some one with 4tx's per week. 50~ weeks in a year. at only 2000tx in a block. bitcoin is currently limited at only 500,000 users. 
WITH segwit that only goes up to 1million users....
and this is assume there are no businesses operating on bitcoin using more then 4tx's per week. And no miners mining empty blocks. 
1mb of non witness data just strangling bitcoin and can not last. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:34:34


*Edit OK that is fair as I was surprised I didn't see more people complaining in the git issues.
You need to talk to some exchanges. When bitcoind has 300k+ addresses its unstable. It will crash if you try too many sends in a row. It will take 40+ seconds just to do a getinfo call. even on very large servers. large transactions will cost 50$+ in fees because of all the inputs when blocks get full.
I didn't mean I needed the answers, people figured them out over time. Those are the type of questions new dev's working with bitcoin ask.
Businesses need high performance light clients. You need to look into what these 3rd party providers are selling if you want to understand why they are not running bitcoin core.

*longest valid chain
core will never follow an invalid chain, and in core's mind segwit2x is invalid. So core will never follow it. 
IMHO I wouldn't call segwit2x true bitcoin ever as well. However if the community has consensus on following a new bitcoin I could see the community agreeing that being called *bitcoin. And there is precedence on this with ETH and ETC. With the weak side not retaining the name.

This is part of why I always take your side of the debate on these issues with a grain of salt. You are not a user, you do not interact with people in the industry. You are a low end dev completely detached from the bitcoin ecosystem.


*you are not looking very hard. You can not hold more then 3-400k address's till bitcoind goes to shit. ask any exchange, they can not use bitcoin core. they have to write their own clients or use a 3rd party service. bip32 was out years ago, yet bitcoind to this day does not support hd wallets.(yea I know its almost ready) So Backups have to be continually made. Nor do they provide a convenient way to backup the wallet off-site. (as generally the node must be shut down to copy without corruption)
Toshi, //coinbase
bitcore  // bitpay
bitgod //bitgo
These are all full node implementations businesses wrote so they can scale. They didn't do this because they wanted too. They had to write these clients in order to continue to use bitcoin. This is the reason we need more diversity in bitcoin is so people can do this and not rely on bitcoin-core.
You blame bandwidth and harddrive space as why people don't use core's software; because in your head that is all you think about.
But in the real world we have to think about things like. Why is my bitcoin node crashing when I get a lot of sends in a row? Why do I have to make a backup of my 400mb wallet every 100 address's? Why do the docs say not to use the Accounts feature when its coded and useful to me? Why would bitcoind send money as change to an address I gave to a customer with getnewaddress? why does getinfo take 40 seconds to respond after i've been running just fine for 6 months. 
when is the last time you talked to any devs at an exchange about what they need? maybe if you spent less time ostracizing businesses like coinbase who complain about scaling issues. Or exchanges that complain about the millions of support tickets that open when blocks get full. You would start to understand why there are so few nodes out there. and so much controversy with saying "things are ok as they are"
*if you want your ear talked off, send a msg over to polo or bittrex.

But getting miners away from BU, and giving them and users a tool to signal the same way as BU is useful in helping to bring the community together. And it can even make SegWit activate via MASF earlier if miners feel like they are being supported enough to leave BU.

If I recall the peak was around 3900 classic nodes. To cores 5400ish. But again this is not consensus. The numbers are easily faked. And a large body of nodes without miners is worthless.
The miners that broke the Hong Kong agreement set off such a panic that anyone even uttering the word classic in this sub was banned. So it was large enough. I personally was banned for just linking to a block explorer with a classic block version number.
But again, as core likes to keep pointing out, miners themselves are not consensus.

How do we expand bitcoin in a safe and productive manner?

are also bullshit and unfair. SegWit tx's are the same size (slightly larger actually) then normal tx's. SegWit are bigger blocks, and discounting non witness data makes 0 sense, as we all have to download/validate/store the same amount of data regardless of tx type. 
Bitcoin is having explosive growth and already can not support its current userbase. .7mb capacity increase will get gobbled up instantly and fees will continue their parabolic rise unless we do more to meet demand. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:15:24
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:55:50


if your talking about decentralization. I reject the premise that 2mb of non witness data would result in less nodes. The opposite would be true. as the increased userbase would result in more businesses running more full nodes. Bandwith is clearly not the limiter, this is evident in altcoins with higher bandwith that have MORE full nodes then bitcoin. for example ETH. 
Miners and Big blockers have been pushing this for 4 years. This debate is much older then segwit.

I suspect it will be much more decisive, miners will coordinate together and either all jump or none. 
100days of shitty blocktimes, diminished capacity, and exchanges needing 100+ confirms for deposits to be secure from double spending will do great things to the price of that coin. And miners are sure to keep faith and continue to mine a coin that's price is tanking, and for all they know the 100blocks needed to even redeem those rewards might never come. but im sure they will keep mining anyway. makeing sure the 2000blocks comes quickly and the amount to time to get there doesn't go exponential as miners keep dropping out. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:07:34
and exchanges require 320 confirms on classic because of the large double spending risk of a 51pct attack. (I don't like that name as less then 20pct can do the same attack and its still possible to be successful)
And no, no other asset has attempted to secure anywhere close to as much value as bitcoin and switch algo's.
Bitcoin is secure because every super computer on the planet is less then 1pct of the hashing power of the network. 
Switching the algo and your letting google or any large GPU super computer project on the planet come in and double spend anyone they like. and there are tons.

The blockchain with Segwit and 2mb of non-witness data can support about 800 million transactions a year assuming 8,000 transactions per block. 
Assuming 4txs per YEAR (of channels opening closing) the max users with LN and SegWit and 2mb is 80million. And that assuming 100pct of all txs are LN and no exchanges or services are operating...
now without LN, assuming a normal users with 4txs a week all using SegWit txs. 52 weeks in a year, 208 per user / 800,000,000 that is 1.9 million users. 
now that is assuming no exchanges or services are using more then 4tx's a week.

I would be willing to bet every single satoshi I own that when we activate 2mb of non witness data the amount of nodes will dramatically increase. not the opposite. 
Bandwith is NOT the limiters. its necessity. ETH requires MUCH more bandwith and they have MORE FULL NODES. because to use it you NEED to run one (because they dont have spv). you cant handicap a network to support the weakest links. you must grow out of the pains and keep the network growing. If you stop growing you die. That is life.

The bigger questions is if the weak side will even have enough miners to survive. And if it does will people accepting it get double spent into Oblivion.

im sorry when was the last roll call and vote?
consensus is just a silly word core keeps spewing.
Miners not wanting to go against core doesn't mean they didn't want bigger blocks.
Users following core's lead doesn't mean if they were given the chance to say otherwise wouldn't.
first core said it was miners. then a large portion of miners started mining classic blocks. They freaked out and claimed consensus was nodes.
Then classic started a node race. almost got up to 70pct. Then core said nodes don't count to consensus only "economic" nodes. 
Its all a fucking game; there is no consensus only mob rule around here.
and its easy to scare a mob and claim the sky is falling if you follow classic.

Ethereum has almost twice as many full nodes. 9k vr 5k
Most core devs around here like to use nodes as a decentralization metric till it backfires on them. Like Theymos made this post and didnt even take the time to learn anything about eth. 
I generally think of mining when it comes to decentralization. And I don't know the stats but both are pretty bad shape when looking at it like that. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:56:15
lol you have 0 evidence of this. And the biggest indicator. the doping of core nodes and being replaced with new is clearly NOT happening. the total count is just going up. meaning the UASF nodes are new, and most likely not even being used.

Lighting is not cash, and 1mb means we can not expand the userbase much more then we have now. 4mb~ish is an improvement and might support a small increase in userbase with sigwit. but its not enough.

51pct attack does not break immuabilty it can not change transactions. It can not steal bitcoin, it can not change the rules of the protocol. You clearly need to educate yourself about what the Bitcoin protocol is.
51 pct attack can double spend exchanges, and Bitcoin in motion only. That is why 6confirms is only considered partially confirmed. This is the nature of Bitcoin and is not breaking immutability or any laws of the protocol. The only risk with a 51pct attack is censorship.

None of these Exchanges have announced any plans to support it officially, or as far as I know unofficially. And the technical tools to support both chains just do not exist in a consumer versions.

very well actually. have you even been paying attention? ETH has more more daily trade volume then bitcoin now. 


Then we let the markets decide. 


how many blocks can strong buy order mine???
look, blocks are not even spendable till 100 blocks. Less a quarter of 1 pct of miners have shown support for UASF. With less then 5pct and it will be a lifetime before a retarget will ever be reached. If less then 15pct that chain will actually fail to activate segwit before the main chain. 
you just cant make a coin without miners, it was the miners that made ETC, and even short term profitability does not mean all miners just switch instantly. Miners invest in the infrastructure and future of a coin. They build the economy and unless small blockers start showing some actual interest investing hard capital in miners they just absolutely will never keep a weak side alive. 
And all this isn't even taking into account attacks miners can do to weak coins. or just exactly how worthless bitcoin would be with day long blocktimes. no investment = no miners = no coin. its really simple

"Herein lies the threat posed by Bitcoin. In the event that a wealthy Bitcoin investor—or a number of Bitcoin investors—launch a speculative attack on a currency, what can be done to counter it? In theory, individual countries could diversify their reserve portfolio by purchasing Bitcoins from an online exchange. But if a central bank’s reserve is unable to absorb the maturity mismatches suffered by its central banks, who can it turn to? The IMF has no supply of Bitcoins; indeed it has almost no way to obtain them directly. The IMF obtains currency via the quota system and the IMF can only collect quotas from its members. Bitcoin is neither a member of the IMF, nor could it become one if it wanted to—IMF membership is only open to nation-states.142"

It has been clear from the HK agreement they are ready to signal SegWit as soon as it is available in a HF version. 
So signalling both accurately represents their goals.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:04:22
SegWit is bigger blocks, its is more data in every possible way to measure it. limit-space is just a clever way to omit the signature space that is exactly the same size when all is said and done. (that is perhaps faster for validate) however it is bandwith that is the bottleneck on full nodes.

hey could you tell me more about Coinbases patents? will you follow blockstream and hold a defensive patent strategy? 
and if you are not, can you say why?
I don't think your a "corporate schmuck"; and Toshi is pretty cool and all. but what other kind of open-source projects is Coinbase working on?
also, More relevant to this thread; did the ETH foundation provide coinbase with enough support during this fork? if you follow this sub you may have seen pointed out you failed to strip the ETC away from your hotwallets post fork. resulting in customers gaming hundreds of thousands of dollars of value away from you with whats known as a replay attack. You claim to be able to cover deposits. Does that mean you have been buying ETC on the open market to cover losses? 
Many would argue releasing the code for a fork a mere 4 days before activation was dangerous by the ETH foundation. And as a result many other exchanges were unable to prepair for ETC and lost customer funds as well. (ie lost customers ETC)
do you agree or disagree with that sentiment?  why or why not?

if exchanges list UASF coins they will list BOTH chains. It is a total pipe dream that everyone will just switch and upgrade to non core software. Not going to happen.
However exchanges WANT two coins, they want the anarchy, ETC was extremely profitable for them. 
So if UASF has less then 51pct of miners, but more then 10pct needed to activate segwit in time it could totally be a permanent altcoin. And even potentially overtake bitcoin in the long run and whipeout the main chain and become *true bitcoin at some point. 
however that would cause chaos as history was lost, but a total possibility. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:14:45
That is dated. It is going to be compatible with 148. And that also means it's giving miner Support  to UASF and giving SegWit first to.everyone for free. Like the majority want.

not unless they got miners to mine their coin. Without miners there will be no blocks, no blocks no transactions, no transactions no value, no use case. 
And block time really matters, even enough miners to get out a couple blocks a day will still mean it will be many months before a re-target and the usability with be greatly diminished. 
even if many exchanges list it, without 51pct+ of miners it will simply be an altcoin.

that is assuming fees can continue to increase linearly. they cant. there is a max threshold people are willing to pay before they leave bitcoin. The only way to increase revenue is to increase supply. the only way to increase supply long term is increasing blocksize. 
(and no .7mb is not enough for survival.) 
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:04:37
It is all risk/reward. At any time a whole blocks worth of fees could pop into the mempool. If you are targeting the next block and need reliability, good algorithms are more about the fee levels that can potentially enter a block within x amount of time rather then the actual fees in the mempool at any given moment.
The higher the fees go the higher the potential that high fee level can drop into the pool, therefore the higher the permanent fee prediction becomes. And any algorithm that lowers the fee can not be trusted for exchanges and services that demand reliability over effecientcy.

Government use's violence on its people all the time to get people to "confirm, volunteer, operate, consent" to what ever in there mind is "fair"
If a government asks for your money at the barrel of a gun and jail cell they are still asking. Just like Hitler asked the jews to give him all their money, live in the ghetto and do everything he says. The requests were always thought of as "justified" is the minds of the leaders.
All im saying is a collective community asking nicely for money is a lot better then use of lawman with a gun and a jail cell.
Why is it such a bad idea to let poor people choose not to pay taxes if they cant. (or more important not send armed thugs after them if they don't) And if rich people choose to be greedy isn't it more appropriate to  just shame them in public. Isn't that what our culture is best at? putting the uncomfortable spotlight on rich/famous people?
then again we are pretty good with the violence thing as well.
This left/right debate over tax level is just pulling emotional strings and waiting for a fight. Rich people pay almost no taxes because the "law" says they can. It also says GE can pay no taxes and google can send all its money overseas by the billions.

yea before checkpoints, but that has nothing to do with the bottleneck  in full nodes.... bandwith. A node still needs to download the entire block to validate it after the checkpoint. Now, after segwit, not only could some one spam and make a 3.7mb block. but you are making it much cheaper for them to do so! every single node will have to download that entire block, validate the whole thing and store it until a checkpoint is made.

Bitcoin needs privacy, and it is important, but we absolutely must be able to sustain its userbase first and foremost. And Gavin understood the pragmatic approach to bitcoin development much more important. That is why his biggest contributions were in unit tests, and focusing on growth and scaling. as shifting attention otherwise would of been reckless. 
But that is not to say he didn't value the work. There are plenty of examples of complementing even your work. 


But he was NOT willing to sacrifice the network effect, and usability/cost of bitcoin to focus on it.

SegWit tx's are unfairly cheap because they take up the same space (in fact a little bit more), take time to validate, and take up bandwith just like the old style of tx's, yet they cost less in fee's.
Not only does SegWit allow people to make blocks as large as 3.7mb full on worthless transactions that dont move any money. BUT IT GIVES THEM A HUGE DISCOUNT TO DO SO! and that is 3.7mb of blockspace nodes have to download, verify, and then store untill the next checkpoint.
It is unfairly cheap, because it is bad economics.


Miners were pushing for big blocks far before ASICboost was even invented.
But sure, ASICboost is a fair example as why segwit might be held up. But that is totally unrelated to what capacity increase parties want on the network.

The Poor in IRAN are dieing because of a central bank war with us and hyperinflation
money is a big deal, world super powers rely on it to control a populations. The dollar inflating leads to higher food and gas prices worldwide. People are literally dieing in the streets in 3rd world countries because of the decisions made by central bankers here in the states.
People will use bitcoin because the protocal will earn their trust. If a second protocal is trustworthy it must be earned.
But again, most importantly, if you haven't learned to trust bitcoin DONT USE IT. that is the most important difference from BTC and any other world fiat currency, and have a CHOICE to not use it.

The problem is there might be a few new users and small businesses that you actually trick into thinking that. And they will get burned following a super minority fork blindly.

wow, ok, well this needs to be addressed. The safety op is obviously is alluding to is whether or not 148 has consensus, and perhaps if his wallet provider can support a chain split. you completely omitted this and referenced safety of browser based wallets.   you are not safe. As to be safe you need to be able to predict the future with UASF, and if consensus is met. No one knows if UASF has consensus, and anyone claiming otherwise has ulterior motives. And just because SegWit has shown some indications of consensus does NOT mean UASF has. 
the only safe statement that can be made is to not spend/receive bitcoin until the chain split is resolved. anyone telling you one side is safe and the other not is a lier, and probably a biased party. and believing those lies could result in lost funds.

because it is not being adopted by the ONLY consensus mechanism we have. and the entire community absolutely REFUSES to define any other consensus measurement ANY! simply define consensus and big blockers will reach it.

They are making things like UASF that act WITHOUT CONSENSUS. they are using walled gardens like this to play a narrative that is not honest, not accurate, and not in the spirit of bitcoin.

I highly doubt that. What is going on is they automate the BTC withdrawl from MTgox. So its not intelligently trading. It takes the USD sent and places a buy order made to automatically fill right then. 
use bitinstant to fund your MTgox with cash and make your own trades and stop complaining.
This was the only way I got cash instantly into MTgox during the crash. Without them I would never of been able to buy at 55$ because of the 3 day delay with wire transfers.

the goal is NOT to kill a chain. the goal is simply reverse a single transaction and replace it with an other. (double spend) so an exchange MUST protect itself and wait for many more confirms when a chain has weak hashpower.
if an exchange was accepting 1conf on UASF then the cost to attack is only 1 block mined, orphaning the block with the original payment.

no they cant, not like that. Non SegWit miners will not know how to validate segwit tx's, so a theft tx will split the network and they will not be aware.

"Herein lies the threat posed by Bitcoin. In the event that a wealthy Bitcoin investor—or a number of Bitcoin investors—launch a speculative attack on a currency, what can be done to counter it? In theory, individual countries could diversify their reserve portfolio by purchasing Bitcoins from an online exchange. But if a central bank’s reserve is unable to absorb the maturity mismatches suffered by its central banks, who can it turn to? The IMF has no supply of Bitcoins; indeed it has almost no way to obtain them directly. The IMF obtains currency via the quota system and the IMF can only collect quotas from its members. Bitcoin is neither a member of the IMF, nor could it become one if it wanted to—IMF membership is only open to nation-states.142"

well, we both agree its not smart for china to hold so much usd, for us and them.
I think Our main contention is this


This is not true. One can purchase commodities in whatever currency they would like, though sometimes they exchange to USD prior. This is not true for China nor for Iran or any other country. The net effect of pricing in USD is neutral, as buys are matched with sells.
Their are a lot of ramification of using the dollar as a world reserve currency. Wars are fought over currency and with currency. And if you pay attention to the middle east, and China's huge demand for oil, you will understand what is really going on with OPEC.
Think about it; If I ran a huge oil producing country why would I want US dollars? Id want gold. That way I know the money I get from selling my oil will not loose value regardless of what the purchasing government does(this could be the same argument for a reserve currency but hear me out). That way the US cant print money out of thin air and use that to buy my oil. Then the US and China would be doing anything they can to buy more gold. And this huge unquenchable demand for oil would turn into increases in the price of gold. And I will have a nice big vault full of it.  
China wouldn't mind a Gold based reserve currency because its at-least fair.
hint: google what happened to other countries that had my idea of only selling their oil only for gold....

Bitcoin solved this by using the blockchain to keep track of this decentrally. That is why no emoney has ever succeeded in that past because any central authority or issuer is a point of weekness. And tying a digital currency to any other is an extreamly impossible thing to do decentrally.
Just bringing up the non trival nature of the problems BTC addresses; is pretty easy to make bitcoin clones but emoney is serious business

lol, it does no such thing. 


if the only way a dev would work on bitcoin is if they have absolutely total control then they were working in the wrong project anyway. 


is why we are expanding blocks. users said make bitcoin usable or we will leave. 


We have been at this 4 fucking long years. Not our first rodeo. 


the larger bitcoin gets the harder it is to do a hard fork. If they wern't opposed we should have done it 4 years ago. However they didn't see this coming, they were opposed because they thought it was not needed, and they were wrong, and now they changed their fucking minds.

When you have a inflating currency you have to spend. You reward those who spend. That is handy if your trying to sell government bonds; and control the money supply. but an entire pollution that has 0 savings is not healthy on many levels.
but Bitcoin does work. Transactions can go worldwide and function correctly at any price point.
You voluntarily associate with the bitcoin market. Their is no laws forcing anyone to use it.
If a country were to force it citizens to take bitcoin. Or go to jail. A central governing force could "stabilize" prices. but thats completely against everything good about bitcoin.
If you dont like the money supply of btc, you can make a new system and ask people to voluntarily associate with it. Or you can use a governments currency run off force.

you could argue it is greed that is recklessly trying to hard fork the network (BU). But greed powers most market forces that keep bitcoin alive. It keeps speculators investing in the currency, propping up the value for the rest of us. It is what keeps our network much more secure then any other altcoin because miners want the rewards. greed makes markets, and markets is what gives us value.

If UASF does not have consesus every user who runs that software will be on the wrong chain. Every transaction that is done in this chain would have the ability to replay. Same way coinbase lost funds during the ETC split. Every payment accepted could be double spent because of the lack of miners. Every accepted payment could be on the short chain and invalid on the main. Any exchange or large service can litterally be out millions in just a few blocks.

Bitcoin as a protocol works at any price point. Gold has properties that made it start to be used as currency. Rare, divisible, fungible.
Bitcoin was just as usefull when it was worth pennies as it is now worth 100's. What changed? 
gold price evaluation  is purely on demand; and demand is set into tradition. Bitcoins properties make it useful. But its the demand that that evaluates the vaule. And that demand is speculative. Just like the long term speculative tendencies of banks to hold gold. As traditionally gold demand stays high.

you will be given the chance to upgrade and follow the new(bitcoin) as new releases come out for most software out there.
if you choose not to follow, according to your client, the mining power of the network just dropped 80pct+. meaning blocktimes will skyrocket to 1day+. Capacity will go to very little (1mb per day), and moving coins will be very hard. and if enough miners leave you will be stuck in this diminished state forever as there is not enough miners to ever reach 2000blocks and re-target. 
at that point you would probably have to fork to yet a third bitcoin in order to stay on small blocks with sane block-times. 
and all this time you will only be able to interact with other small block clients, and have the risk of spending your coins on both chains accidentally unless you enact yet more new code from new releases that deal with replay protection.
or you can upgrade and enjoy fast blocktimes, increased capacity, and as the network grows with more users, greater token value.

ehh, In my mind even doge is a more real currency than nxt because there was no premine and all the miners are equal. Hence the quicker and more widepsread adoption. The distribution is a fair market because no one had an unfair advantage in obtaining them. Nxt was doomed from the start because who is going to put there time/money/effort into a system that is rigged to the creators? If were going to use a centralized system we might as well just use paypal or chasebank or any other bank payment system. 
the tech behind nxt looks very interesting don't get me wrong. Maybe some one will clone it and make a version without a premine. And as long as the mining is fiar that is something Id use, as long as it is open source.

look into bitcoin armory,    60btc means enough to me Id take the time to make an offline wallet. 
read up on it on the site but it boils down to this.
Boot your pc from a live disk, disable wireless. install armory. Make wallet, print paper wallet. save digital wallet on encrypted usb, keep it handy. send coins to a generated address and its secure. either go big and send winnings to savings or move most in right away and keep a little out to gamble with. just make sure you go offline again to withdrawal!
offline wallets are 100pct safe with a trusted os. Id do the same method if I had millions.
Keeping coin in blockchain.info perfectly fine for now but if your OS is compromised so is your coin. oh and don't be worried about sealswithclubs.eu I'm sure they keep a cleaner server then you keep your OS. No offense; but anyone keeping a server that handles bitcoin for as long as they have been around has a great crew.

It will never be instant, Newbi's need it to work instantly or they freak out. Not 2 days not 2 hours not even 2 minutes. Make a new wallet on blockchain.info get instant access to bitcoins without any hassel. its grandma friendly.
if you planning on reinstalling again I highly recomend moving the coins to a online wallet or if you have a large amount make a paper wallet.

SegWit tx's are unfairly cheap because they take up the same space (in fact a little bit more), take the same time to validate, and take up bandwith just like the old style of tx's, yet they cost less in fee's.
Not only does SegWit allow people to make blocks as large as 3.7mb full on worthless transactions that dont move any money. BUT IT GIVES THEM A HUGE DISCOUNT TO DO SO! and that is 3.7mb of block nodes have to download, verify, and then store untill the next checkpoint.
It is unfairly expensive, because it is bad economics. Large blocks will let the supply stretch to meet demand. not keep it artificially capped. 
just like the 150$ hamburgers in venezuela right now. that burger joint is not happy supplies are so scare and demand is so high that people would pay that. They would make MUCH more money running a fair business at a fair market price.

are you willing to loan people your bitcoin?
problem with loaning a hard currency is if the value goes up; the likelihood of a default goes up as well.
That is why banks like soft Fiat currencys; as long as Bernanke is throwing trillions at the people, the chances of default are not that bad.
As soon as the rates go up, and money is hard to come by. people are going to stop paying and banks need to bring in the hard hand on people who dont pay up.
Imigine if visa loaned you 100btc line of credit on your card.
that 13000k now. But if bitcoin goes to 260 again. thats now 26000k you owe
what if you spent that money? what if you bought company expenses. the likelihood of you defaulting on your visa is going through the roof.

Visa/ MC doesnt want to get in that business either.

When a currency deflates prices fall. A lot of economists would say that is bad because the stores don't make as much money. (items on selves are worth less money then when they were bought) and profits fall.
But the import side is the poor person on a fixed income can buy more. That extra money makes a world of a difference.
Its true not many people are paid in btc as of now. But a lot of unwealthy people invest savings into bitcoin and it helps them the most.
It is better macro-economically to have a deflationary currency in the that the majority is in the hands of the people; Rather then an inflationary one where the majority is locked in a bank vault with the only way for the average person to touch it is with high interest rates.

yellow is buy orders blue is sell. if buy orders are pushing the price up yellow is on top; if sell orders are pushing down the price then blue is on top. Notice to correlation   
the space between the buy and sell orders is a good indicator just how "loose" the price is. eg the bigger the gap the faster the price can change.
candlesticks should be self explanatory. indicating the price veriance green is a general buying trend red selling bla bla.
If you go to chart options group by price you can watch the "walls" build up and disappear in real time.

well everyone on all the forums will give you a big debate of power cost vr profit ext.
I do believe it is currently still profitable if you don't factor in cost of the device.
However that may change soon as the difficulty rises with asic's turning on. but in the grand picture even if you pay more for electricity then buying the coins outright its still cool to experiment with. Running those calculations are the most important distributed computing experiment ive ever been involved in.  
So if you got the card and it burning out on ya wont interfere with your gaming then might as well go to town.

the agreement was not a promise for them to make anything happen. it was for the participants to work on the hard fork code. And those very same devs not only failed to do that. They became of the most vocal small blockers. They were the leaders of the F*** miners crowd. They were the centerpieces of the conflict. 
saying you agree with one thing, signing your name on it. Then turning around and doing exactly the opposite IS dishonourable. The only exemption to this is possibly luke-jr who did write some code, but remains ideologically opposed to 2mb of non witness data as called for in the agreement. 
The honourable thing would to have gone to the conference and refused to sign something they were opposed to. and inform them why.

MtGox is the lifeblood of bitcoin right now; simply allowing two members of the foundation to bicker like this irresponsible and completely detrimental to the success of bitcoin.
I understand the foundation is run by people who are also running for profit businesses. However This lawsuit is very untimely. If a court upholds the lawsuit MTgox gets dealt a major blow; therefore bitcoin gets damaged. If the court dismisses it Mtgox still spent all this time in court when they could of been working on the new trade engine... again bitcoin as a whole looses.
The only exception I would give is to Gavin; who's been doing an amazing job maintaining the client. The foundations job is to keep people like gavin paid and keep the big business out of his purview. The foundation needs to get big businesses to work together for the betterment of bitcoin. Nothing about whats going on in this case is good, or helping bitcoin go "mainstream"

you can receive money from multiple address and the clients show all the funds you can spend by that wallet. But each address has its own private key generated by your wallet to spend the bitcoin sent to each address.

brainwallets have lost people TONS of money because people use weak phrases. and is NOT cold storage. brain wallets is HOT storage with a passphrase. (cold/hot is online/off)
Cold storage means a computer you know it 100.00000000% safe. Because 1) you know every line of code on it, 2) it never touchs the internet
ie, Ubuntu live disk + turn off wifi
Bitcoin Armory is full feature and used by pro's and novice alike.
Most bitcoin people I know keep offline computer ( i use a netbook). These Computers that have never touched the internet. In fact on mine I physically removed the wifi card with a dremel and soldering iron; as well as the speakers/mic and any other io device.
now that I got my rant done: the ELI5
Every address has a private key. To have a safe address you need to keep that key safe. Because any modern OS with an internet connection is designed to be insecure; making this private key on your computer is just asking for trouble. So you make an OS that never touch's the internet, make your private key, back it up (print it out, its just a number) and clean up. as long as you secure that key's backup. And you truly cleaned up and deleted all that data. you can be 100pct secure in your coins.

well 80pct signed the agreement. so we expect 80. 
But some(not I) would say we need 100pct of miners AND 100pct of nodes.
IMHO, if our goal is a fork where the weak side is so weak it wont reach a re-target in our lifetime (aka dead) then we need 95pct of miners+.
but really a pragmatic person would say this is going to get fought out in the exchanges anyway with economic powers deciding the winner over trading 2 coins. and in that case we just need a economic super-majority.

thats just false; unlike the US china does not recognize bitcoin as money(currency bla bla)
its an asset; assets do not fall into money transmission. And China does not regulate what assets its citizen can and can not buy. and transmitting assets is legal.
Merchants cant even accept USD for payments. The prohibition of stores from accepting bitcoin or anything other than RMB is a prohibition on barter not on bitcoin.
The problems now are not legal, no one went to jail, bitcoin is not criminal. Its the payment providers and misunderstanding that is behind the problems. Not the law.

NO, most in person fraud results in whats known as a "chargeback"
Not only do merchants loose the product, they ALSO loose the payments.
and on top of all that, get more then 1pct chargebacks and your contract is broke with visa and they take even more fines out of your account.

The bitcoins come directly from MTgox. They have USD sitting in MTgox and at the time of the transfer it places an order and sends the btc to the given address.
there was a 1pct fee but you are buying at MTgox ask price.

customer has an address, can prove he paid. thats how bitcoin works. he pay the address presented and gets product. everyone on the network have proof he paid with receipts sent worldwide and verified.
If he is trying to defraud bitpay that wouldn't work either as they have record of all address's made by them.
The only way he has any chance of defrauding anything is if he snuck that app onto a unsuspecting merchant who thinks it the app is from bitpay. And even then he would only get 1 transaction before the merchant and customer knows what happend.

bitcoin biggest selling point isnt the tech, its the decentralization in nature. nxt is not decentralized. If it got big like bitcoin there is a central point of failure (the premine). This is a design flaw. Resistance to failure is why we in use bitcoin and not anything else. And it is why we don't trust anything else that can fail.
also, maybe its just me; But please stop thinking anyone in bitcoin gives a flying fuck about green; no one gives a shit about environmental costs. The harder it is to reproduce the mining the better; safer and more decentralized it is.
also, this is offtopic, so stop complaining about the downvotes. Thats why there is a downvote; users can moderate for themselves.

agree'd; but the bitcoin currency is independent from the actions of its users. ie People burned by pirate was not due to any feature or flaw of bitcoin; It was the parties using the currency. in ripple the network relys on a network of 3rd parties holding multiple currencies and guaranteeing them.
In my mind the biggest flaw in bitcoin right now is MTgox. Way to much trust is needed to buy bitcoins. trying to tell some one the best place to buy large amounts of bitcoin is to wire money to japan is a tough sell. Plus there has been more funding delays and security concerns then I can count on one hand.
Now the Mtgox guys want us to really trust 3rd parties to act like a bank exchanging currencies and holding transactions.
Any mass circle of trust that allows users to be anonymous, or pseudo anonymous (ie a user with a bad reputation can start over) is going to have a bad time.
Ripple I feel is going to bring out all the bad internet culture of bitcoin (or one could argue the bad side of human nature) and non of the good. trusted parties will spring up; and operators will be too tempted to take the money and run.
Sorry but I completely understand the banking argument when it comes to trust. When a bank takes my money. (as they ohh so often do) the governments foots to bill.
Bitcoin is a currency that requires as close as we can possibly get right now to no trust. an incredible technological feat.
comparing A trading/business networking site that uses centralized governance and 3rd party trust is really apples to oranges to put it lightly.

liquidity is judged by the market; as the price goes up how many coins can get dumped on the market. Because these coins are out of circulation  they can not get put back onto the market regardless of what the price does.

more TLDR of the article
"In order to mitigate the potential impact of Bitcoin, the meaning of Article IV, Section 5 could be expanded to include digital currencies. Rather than limiting its scope to currencies used by colonies or overseas territories, the IMF could use Article IV Section 5 to label Bitcoin—or other digital currencies like it—a “separate currency.”159 As such, the IMF could require member nations to pay part of their subscription quota with Bitcoins.160 This would require member nations to purchase Bitcoins independently. They would then contribute that amount to the IMF’s general fund as part of their quota, receiving an amount of their own currency or special drawing rights"
First, it would ensure that the IMF has an adequate supply of Bitcoins from which to draw on in order to counter a speculative attack on a member-nation’s currency by Bitcoin users. Second, it would avoid undercapitalizing the IMF’s general fund by ensuring that the value of currency going in (Bitcoins) is equal to the value of currency coming out. Finally, incorporating Bitcoins into the IMF’s general fund would help reinforce its legitimacy and, in turn, its stability in the eyes of the international financial community.

@_date: 2013-04-14 23:25:46
the early prevention's are client side. A client wont let you make a transaction if the balance is too low. 
but you could always just import the keys to second wallet client.
But when you broadcast a transaction to the network the miners take it in order, so the first transaction will go though making the second invailed and rejected by the system. 
so the main risk is if I send you a transaction without a FEE. then I reload my keys with a second client and send coins some where else with a fee. Then the Fee will get processed first and yours will never confirm.
However if I send a transaction with a fee and try a second also with a fee the amount of mining power needed to get my second to go first grows exponentially fast. Its something like 5pct of the entire network hashing for 30 seconds.
main point, if you get a transaction with a fee sent to you, 0 confirms are pretty damn safe.

Dispensaries traditionally have a hard time holding bank accounts. (especially if they tell the bank the truth) Because federal laws prohibit MMJ banks have been told before by the fed that FDIC might get pulled if they service illegal business.
Therefore a lot of them dont risk holding bank accounts and rely on just cash.
This means they hold an insane amount of cash on hand.  Because of there iffy relationship with police robberies are rarely responded too quickly or investigated fully. Many criminals know they are an easy target. 
Also, DEA and other fed's raid dozens of dispensary every month. (there are more dispensaries than starbucks in CO and this number fluctuates wildly because of this) The main motivation of the fed's coming in is the seized money they get. All computers, safes and products get taken. And if the dispensary does not have the resources to fight the charges (often costing more than the seized money) the feds just got a nice big payday and budget boost.
Bitcoin would make it so 1.) robbers dont get anything but product 2.) feds dont get any payday. ( because of federal laws mmj is disposed not auctioned off as of yet like other assets)
taking away the financial motivation from the fed(or the civilian) robbers would help things greatly in the MMJ industry.

if you steal gold, its still theft. exact same laws if you stole cash. Bitcoin is the same way. In fact texas court already ruled that under us security definitions, bitcoin denominated security are security and in this specific case bitcoin is legally money. trendon shavers is being persecuted under full extent of the laws for running a ponzi and ripping off cleints. 
the real issue is when you buy or sell gold it is a commodity? or money? Ben Bernake told Ron Paul duing a congressional hearing that gold is NOT money. I dont need to ask my customers SS number, proof of address, two forms of government id and then submit all that for approval to the us government to make sure your not on a list.
under fincen guidlines, even me selling you 1 penny worth or bitcoin I have to collect all that info, Or I could be fined, raided, property seized and put in jail for violating money transmission laws. and because of the Patriot act there are little hundreds of thousands of agents with guns ready to enforce this.

Each public address has a private key to spend. Once you have that key any bitcoin sent to it can be spent at any time. You never need to "update" a wallet, its simply a key.

ahh ok, im getting the gist of it. I really like the 2 of 3 party part. 
escrows are still going to have the issue of traditional FIAT problems. Iy they accept cash deposited into there bank; bank might freeze it like what happened to bitinstant. If they accept ACH they could have reversals like coinbase spends millions to do risk assessments to protect against.
As a consumer who do I go to if the escrow becomes unresponsive? in that case I'm out my money, the sending party hasn't received his money and the agent isnt able to tell either party what to do.
As an escrow agent, what happens if I  accept ach and after the 3rd party sends the bitcoin and buyer pulls the transfer? when you say


does that mean i'm waiting the 8 days for basic ach, or the 30 that can still be reversed?
either way, this is making buying bitcoin just as inconvenient as traditional methods.
Im thinking the system that will win out in the long run will be where you log into the service. And see a map of the nearest "trusted agents" willing to meet up with you, and receive cash in hand. These agents are trusted by the escrow agent. and as soon as they have cash is in hand; bitcoin can instantly be sent.  
goal should be to bypass traditional banking; not attempt to play in their game.

1) opensource, anyone can contribute to the code. and get access to the code. all trademarking and patenting have a very rigorousness bitcoin foundation preventing any trademarks on bitcoin. feel free to make and distribute any logos representing bitcoin. There is a multimillion dollar foundation preventing anyone from sueing you.
2) 2 primary reasons; one easy to accept, no fraud  risk(costs merchants 350billion last year in lost revenue), same reasons to take cash yet they can accept from anywhere are on the planet. second; same reason anyone would buy bitcoins. The can increase in value sometimes 200pct in one hour. making you a boat load of money. (if you dont want to hold (hedge against loss of value) a merchant can use bitpay and still have benefits of part 1)  
3) in order for bitcoin to increase in value, YES we want people to hoard! This is good! There will always be some one willing to sell at some price, and that is how the free market picks the price. No matter how much USD tries to go into the market; the flexible nature of rising price will allow it. Their will never be a "no one on the face of the earth will sell a single bitcoin because they are all hoarded" thats silly.
4)its backed by a cryptographic algorithmic application that protects your money by the law of the universe (ie the processing power to crack the cryptography is IMPOSSIBLE to break without breaking the laws of thermodynamics)    what is the dollar backed by? a banking network and government force. so you pick what history has shown to be more stable to stand the test of time.
5)there are 1,400 trillion units of bitcoin. roughly 80 million for every human on earth. and thats just with the code already prepared for...  its trivial to add a decimal later for when we have populations in the trillions...
6)the walls in buying bitcoin are limitations in the traditional banking system. you use services like money-gram and other money transfers to get money into the system. These are limitations put up by governments to prohibit money movement. The same problems bitcoin fixes.   That is why the best way to get bitcoin is to sell a product. Then you cut out the US banking system entirely.

Short answer is no.
CC is the equivalent as sharing you private bitcoin key with the merchant. And hoping they only charge you what you authorized, and hope they don't share that key with anyone else.
BTC needs to sign, review, broadcast. which is two way communication. 
technically you could put you bitcoin private key on a magstrip. And then the merchant could accept that key, take there bitcoin and move on. 
but credit cards in general are not a sustainable payment model and bitcoin does need two way communication. So NFC and other one touch things are much more likely to be seen.

do you want to reward savers or spenders?
a slow steady never changing deflation is good. Hyper-deflation leads to instability and crash's just like hyper-inflation does.
but think about it, why would you want a currency that slowly becomes less and less valuable? would you want to have have a slow stable increase? encourage people savings, not spending more then they can afford..

Fiat is backed by force. Try running a business and refuse cash. Men with guns will show up and lock you in a cage until you behave properly. The entire system will fall apart if it wasn't for the guys with guns.
bitcoin is backed by a protocol. voluntary associate with it and we will work together, deviate and you will be ignored.

This isnt a game changer because it doesn't address the 2 main bottlenecks in merchants accepting btc. How do their customers get btc easy without getting charged fees and how do merchants get their btc turned into dollars without fees. Truth is bitpay can bearly beat the credit cards processing fee of 3pct. Not even taking into accout the 4pct bitinstant charges.
And why does a merchant even care about generating addresses. Just use one address from a offline wallet and use blockchain.info site as a pos. got a nice beep and shows deposits in usd.    Plus doesnt armory have watch only wallets that can generate address in an online deamon? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:59:52

Its like outlawing water. The internet is going to exist. btc will continue to aswell. 
btc is one of the last ways to actually own property. If your smart with your keys no you wont loose it, and as long as you have the internet you will not loose your ability to spend.
I think your completely overeating to the latest headlines. No company has been fined, no company has been told to shut down, no company has even been audited yet. The only time police officers even touch's a bitcoin user it was a botched drug moving and not even in the USA.
but most importantly, bitcoin is voluntary, if your not convinced don't buy any. cheaper coins for me.

No they dont. A "factor" must be secure. Say i steal your phone. If you have biometrics as a factor I simply look on this high gloss fingurprint magnet you call a phone and I got your pw. I log in and now only 1 factor protects you.
Biometrics are not pw. They could be used as a username. But that has privacy issues with using the same username on every service. All in all biometrics have more potential for abuse by governments then any real use by the individual.

@_date: 2013-09-30 23:02:34
that 2btc is going down 30pct every two weeks due to the difficulty adjustment. And that just current rates.
between now, and the fantasy land time BFL actually delivers this product a lot of adjustments will happen.
Also, BFL probably will never deliver this product as paypal and other payment providers are doing pretty well to bankrupt them.
word of advice, just buy bitcoin and hold, speculating on mining is much harder way to make money.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:36:59
I dont disagree with any of that. But saying gold is backed by anything but tradition is misguided.  The same for bitcoin. That tradition theoretically could end at any time. But as long as they remain secure and not fully replaced with anything else they are very useful and dont show any signs of ending any time soon.

familiar is subjective; when you build a live-disk from ubuntu your getting a public build. anyone can build from source and compare the binary packages. Getting it from them is all the familiarity I need (ie ubuntu's page).
but even if there was a rootkit, designed to capture private keys and transmit. If your on a live disk that rootkit would have no medium to save the data or its own backup and would be destroyed after reboot. (technically 15minutes+ after your ram is powered down)

@_date: 2013-11-24 06:02:26
maybe he just likes the look and feel and wants to run his own wallet. bitpay is about btc-&gt;usd  if he wanted to just keep the btc-&gt;btc and be able to switch between the bitpay app.
If a user deposited into an address that was not bitpay, and then he claimed bitpay messed up. its pretty easy to find out but simply contacting bitpay. 


that is the most retarded thing I ever herd. how a merchant collects there bitcoin doesn't mean anything at all to the customer. and no consumer protection is when a 3rd party comes in. (ie bitcoin is sent to a trusted 3rd party like on sites like bitmit, for dispute mediation)

Like I said, merchant can not take USD for goods as well, nor any other currency. only RMB are allowed for purchases. not even barter is allowed. ie im going to give you some eggs if you give some of those noodles. 


who is they? the government? that is FLASE. the they that stoped the deposts are the private companies that are payment providers for the exchanges. the "they" that matters is the government, and "they" said buying and selling bitcoin is legal, just as buying and selling eggs, or noodles or any other asset is legal. (as long as its priced in RMB)
The halt on deposits was due to these payment providers not understanding the rules and not because any act they were doing was declared unlawful.

to be more specific to what i'm looking for. 
actually the address should come from and offline PC. I prefer Amory, but really any offline wallet will do. (this is the secure way to hold coins, bitaddress.org is not secure!)
Simply make a wallet and save a hundred or soo in a .txt,  excel whatever. and transfer via usb stick to a online PC.
Load that into a SQL table and have the site run off those address.
a good place to start is 
it can send a POST to your site every time there is a payment to any of those address's

or can I withdraw bitcoin from my M pesa account.

Premise ; bitcoin has no intrinsic value
Premise : All currencies without intrinsic value are Fiat
False; Fiat comes from the declaration of tender. There is no legal system that declares anything about bitcoin. Fiat as a term is very old, and its meaning very well defined. Bitcoin trades in units, if you ignore the digital aspects it is more like salt, or sand or a natural resource(asset). Its existence is brought though a process outside all legal frameworks and more akin to nature.   (computations proof of work vr nature and earth formations) The market value of these items are determined, and like sand or salt, it use as a money is purely social(voluntary) and not legal.
need to understand the origins.

How We Collect Information About You
When you visit the BIPS website, we may collect your IP address and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed. When you open an account, we collect the following types of information from you:
    Personal information, such as your name, email and other similar information.
    Financial information, such as the full bank account numbers that you add to your BIPS account or give us when you use the BIPS services.
    Scanned copies of government issued photo ID and utility bills / company registration.
am I wrong in the assumption you need an account to "pair" with a qr? maybe I didnt take enough time to read.
By wallet I expect an app that can generate private keys, and send bitcoin.

You have never been to court;
Courts get their money, or you get f***ed. that is how shit works. Our entire system is built to deal with dead beats.

But being a deadbeat and not having money is the governments MO. They are really good at ruining people lifes, especially if you DONT have the money.
Pretending any outcome from this would be different if it were not bitcoin is silly. People steal money, people try to hide it, people end up in court with layers trying to find said money.
pretending Trendon is not going to get fucked by the long dick of the law if this court starts handing out sentences because "the government cant take bitcoin" is silly as well.

@_date: 2013-08-10 22:02:47
how about actually offering USD withdrawals, what a extreme and radical feature.
MTgox isn't overpriced because BTC has a bigger demand on MTGox. The USD on mtgox is worthless and people trying to get there BTC out cant without running up the price.
MTgox could be buying bitcoin at 92$ from coinbase or bitstamp and then turning around and selling it for 103 on their own markets.

No action you or I can take will have any effect on any of those options.
People can allow "regulation" but it will all be voluntary. Bitcoin is a protocol, it will interact with every human on earth if they so choose.
Governments don't want that, they want to be able to block "bad" people from being able to use the system. Nothing you or I do  will change the protocol to censor people. You can point a gun at an algorithm all day, its not going to change for you, or anyone else.

because mtgox is SHUT DOWN, for 12 hours; I cant believe I just typed that... what is the bitcoin world coming too... but that is why Bitinstant will not send to address...

I don't think you are understanding what world reserve currency means... they are accumulating dollars BECAUSE its a world reserve currency. Need to buy oil? you MUST use US dollars. Need to buy weapons? you must use US dollars. ALL world Commerce MUST be done in US dollars unless our central banks will play interference. That is why China needs to hold trillions in dollars to get anything done in world commerce.
They want to the world to dump the US dollar as a world currency so they don't have to hold them! That is why they support ANY AND ALL alternatives.
