I interpreted your whole tone to be sarcastic, and it sounded like you were imitating an American by saying "here in America." It was my mistake, however, for interpreting it as a heavily sarcastic, condescending attack at Americans. I assumed you were saying something to the effect of "I'm an American and I'M ALWAYS RIGHT."
You're right and I'm wrong about it being racist, since it is primarily a cultural thing. But thievery is also just a basic human characteristic. It's going to happen all over the world. Merchants try to bend over backward to keep us happy here too, as I'm sure you know, but it's still very common to see stealing. 
Contacting the authorities will get things sorted out, but if they reimburse you the money from the malicious company, is that not pretty much just a chargeback? The difference here being, the government does the chargeback in that case, while it's a company doing it in America.
I don't think chargebacks are the problem, I think the frequency with which people can initiate and have successful chargebacks is the problem.

I finally see your point, and yeah, I think it's just about spot on. Thanks for offering a new, much more accurate perspective and ultimately completely changing my view.
It is weird to have a civilized conversation on Reddit, but I find that most arguments can be turned into productive conversations if even one person can tone down their emotions and try to see the other person's side. As we both know, that's much easier said than done, so a lot of times you just have shouting and ranting matches with nothing of value gained by either person.

You're being incredibly condescending and racist. People in America aren't all entitled pricks, they are just people. I'm willing to bet you'll have a similar number of entitled pricks in America as you would in any other first world country. The fact that you blindly hate Americans shows your ignorance and racial intolerance.
1BTC was trying to make the point that, while the customer is not always right, the customer deserves to recieve what they purchased in its described condition. We have consumer protection laws in the US too, but chargebacks still exist because **some merchants break those laws.** Tell me, what if you bought something expensive from an online shop with your "superior" irreversible payment system, then they send you a defective product, and the shop tells you to suck it? Say they had enough identifying information online for you to pursue a lawsuit. You'd then have to prove that the item you recieved was defective upon delivery, and if you do win the case, you'll probably have spent more in legal fees, stress, and time than you did for the product.
In America, when this happens, you initiate a chargeback. If this were to happen in a place with irreversible payments, tell me, how will you get your money back?

I don't see the problem with making you wait... They only make you wait if you're untrusted, and they tell you beforehand that you have to wait. Also, if they do cancel your order right before you're supposed to get the bitcoins, it's probably because their fraud detection system picked it up on accident. In every case I've read about in which this happened, coinbase sold back the coins at the original price and apologized for canceling it.

Not only Gmail. Everyone should enable 2FA with every account they have. Most websites that use 2FA work with the Google Authenticator app. 
Also, it's paramount to make sure that your Google Account isn't compromised in other ways. Go to the [Google account security settings page]( and make sure no apps or websites that you don't completely trust have authorization to access your account. Look over your app passwords and delete anything that looks suspicious or isn't in use. Make sure your recovery phone numbers/emails are secure. For example, with some carriers, you can just log in through their website and read texts without actually having the phone. A hacker could log into your account this way. Also, if a backup email doesn't also have these security precautions taken, your primary email is also insecure.
Finally, on the actual phone with the 2FA app, make sure the app is secure. Use a trustworthy app like Google 2FA, or if you really can't use Google 2FA, any other trustworthy app that doesn't have permission to access your networks. If your phone is rooted/jailbroken/whatever, make sure any apps that have root or system read (or even execute) access are trustworthy, since they may be able to steal your 2FA tokens. On Android, if you use Xposed, be especially careful, since your codes can very easily be stolen. Lastly, make sure no apps have permission to take screenshots or record the screen, or else your 2FA codes could just be screenshotted/recorded.
Never use the same password twice anywhere unless you don't care if the account is stolen. 
Everything above is just basic security. There is a lot that I've left out. If there is anything that should be in this comment, please reply and I'll add it.
**TL;DR: 2FA everywhere. Look over Google security settings page for anything suspicious. Make sure phone with 2FA app is secure.**

Thank you. I think you are also being very level headed too. I have to say that you did put out a really good argument, and I'm going to have to change my view and agree with you. Chargebacks are fundamentally flawed, and the reason they exist is because of our flawed mentality and insecure transaction/payment system. Americans do tend to have the mentality of "the customer is always right," and credit cards are so insecure that it's very necessary to most people to have the comfort cushion of a chargeback in case a merchant wrongs you. Unfortunately, chargebacks can also be abused very easily. 
Like you said, the monetary/transaction systems of the countries are very different, and it's only in America that customers can easily  and shamelessly exploit it to their own benefit.

I don't consider myself a bad cook. Even eating at, say, a very good restaurant when I'm not hungry is tedious. Food, IMO, can only be good if you're hungry *and* are in the mood to eat. In order to make myself hungry, I'd probably have to not eat until around dinner time. It would be incredibly unhealthy to do this daily, even if I was able to binge my required maintenance intake. Also, sometimes I wouldn't even be in the mood to eat, even while hungry, so while I'd be satisfying my hunger by eating, it would still be a tedious task.
I don't consider it part of the human experience. I believe my time can be allocated to more important things. As such, when it comes down to it, we both just have really varying viewpoints on the enjoyability and purpose of food.

I also run into this issue a lot. Whenever this happens, if you can find a reason for each permission the app has, and the app is open source, it is most likely still safe to install. 
The quicker thing to do, though, is usually to find another app with the same function and less permissions. Sometimes, however, you can't find another app. In this case, if you're running a custom Android 4.4 ROM, chances are it has an app permission restrictions menu. Just go to settings&gt;apps and select the app. Look for "Privacy Guard" or "Permission Restrictions." From there it's pretty straightforward. 
If all else fails, you either just have to not install the app, or install it and hope it won't abuse its permissions.
**Also, ever since the recent Google Play update, some of the permissions are hidden in the pop-up dialogue before you install an app. You have to scroll to the bottom of the page and tap on this link to see every permission:

I've actually thought exactly that before. Eating is pretty annoying. I have to take time out of my day to eat when I could be doing something productive (or browsing reddit) instead. If I'm running late in the mornings, being able to drink some pink goo rather than cook and eat a whole meal would be a godsend. I'd then have more time to productive things, or at least things I enjoy. 
Instead of cooking and having a 15 minute session of *chew, chew, swallow* 3+ times a day, I'd definitely rather drink pink goo. Plus, if I'm busy or in a hurry, I don't have to skip a meal; I can just drink the pink goo.
Also, there are times when I haven't eaten enough for the day, but really don't feel like eating (tired, not that hungry, etc). I just have to drink pink goo and will not end up not having consumed enough calories for the day.
It's also very hard to cook and eat a variety of nutritious foods. This leads to deficiencies of certain nutrients and excesses of others. The ability to balance that out with a pink goo would be amazing.
I'm sure that most other people don't also share my sentiments, but I'm someone who would want to give up eating food if it no longer became necessary.

I'll answer number one. Bitcoin was not created with the purpose of anonymity. The personal information collection I'd imagine is for security measures.

But Satoshi holds a considerable amount of bitcoins - 10-15% of the current supply of bitcoins, and 5-10% of the total amount of bitcoins that will ever be made.

I wouldn't recommend it. If this person is getting an S4, seems to me like he/she wants a high end phone. While the Moto G is amazing for a budget phone, it still lacks a lot of features which an S4 would have. 
A Nexus 5 would be a great choice for an inexpensive yet high end phone that has comparable features to an S4 and a superior SoC. The only main gripes are the fact that the battery isn't easily accessible and there is no SD card slot. The spotlight of the Nexus is the fact that it's pure google, so if you're moving to an android phone because of Google's openness (allowing of bitcoin apps), then a pure google phone would probably be great for you.
