Research Triangle Park. It's like our version of Silicon Valley; I was using it in that same broad sense to refer to the booming tech industry of central North Carolina.

Yep. They've been doing that for generations here in the States with "shelf elf" competitions. Except that is smarter because the parents have to come in with their kids or to track their kids down when they inevitably get lost.

...unless you view healthcare as a fundamental human right.
Pragmatic libertarianism does exist.

Yep, although some people play it like it does. The dedication with some L8s on both sides is crazy.

Yep. Charlotte, from where our beloved governor used to be the mayor. There's been a history of serious conflicts of interest from the gubernatorial office- he also was a career company man at Duke Energy, and consequentially appointed all his colleagues to regulatory positions and along with those colleagues, has made some [incredibly shady decisions]( benefiting heavily from near-immunity thanks to our overzealous Christian Republican supermajority in the General Assembly.

NC politico here. I write about our legislature, there is nothing reasonably good natured about this. There was an interested party; this isn't some libertarian revolution. Still, RTP is poised to make a shitload of BTC.
edit: this isn't a bad thing, I just really feel that it is time to make it clear that these decisions aren't made out of some novel, deus ex posterus set piece. Maybe the fightin' 49 can use a little push from the right people...

I don't know, Ingress hasn't had too many serious problems, just minor microscale ones related to "Wi-Fi hacking". The app does require that mock locations be disabled on launch, which is standard for any AR/geocaching game.

So we will rely on your infinite wisdom to decide what is okay to ingest and what isn't, then?
I'd much rather a meth user buy the stuff from a reputable and recommended source on SR than buy some horribly impure and possibly contaminated shake and bake stuff made on the street. People have the right to make their own decisions, but we can certainly reduce the harm done any way we can.

Did you even stop and think whether or not you had a remote clue of what you were talking about before you started clickety clacking away over there?

The amount of resources the Justice Department has and will continue to expend on locking away consenting adults for purchasing and selling substances that they are fully aware the consequences of use solely because the substances are considered "bad" by the government is absolutely deplorable.

If there was only a way to project this shirt into my field of vision at all times.
