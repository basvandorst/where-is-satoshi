Yo love your drawings! Glad too see you’re active in my favourite subreddits as well!

Nice, but $10 tx fee will be ridiculous.

I mean for a normal purchase, not the maximum value you can buy with bitcoin.

What I’m saying is that it’s just still impractical to use bitcoin to purchase stuff at a shop if LN and Segwit is still not implemented. I’m still a newbie at this, so I might have some misunderstandings.

I’ve been trying to transfer my btc out of Coinbase but $12 tx fee for just $80 worth of btc is too much. What should I do?

Love your sven and dazzle comic as well! Keep the good stuff coming!

Correct me if I’m wrong, but it takes 10 mins for the tx to be confirmed right?

My country isn't listed :(

Removing it would just be more logical...

This might be worth a read because the site is shut down already.

I’m just 16, cant apply for one

I believe its only for US citizens
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:07:56
No, it is not
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:04:59
The problem is I do not have a credit card.

Thanks :)
