Lightning is great, though not a complete solution.

You would then have a billion SPV users with less than 10 transactions per second amongst them
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:50:24
So roughy 12,000/s

it’s not possible to have 1000 transaction in one  on-chain transaction unless you are at layer 2
@_date: 2019-08-08 14:35:44
Sorry meant 1 billions users, not SPV users.
My point still stands 
Well 10 transaction per second is less than a million transactions per day if evenly distributed, so more than that.

There are a number of issues:
- each of your coins just became 1200x easier to 51% attack 
- supply becomes essentially unlimited by simply creating more clone chains. 
- you need 1200x more full nodes or each current full node to run full nodes of each of the 1200 chains

In my view Scarcity of money is by consensus, ex I could make my own bill or gold alternative tomorrow but no one would use it because of consensus on current forms of money
So maybe theoretically you could have consensus on 1200 chains but seems improbable 
Also in you theoretical example if someone wants  to accept/trade between 1200 chains trustlessly without SPV then they need to personally run 1200 full nodes
This is not possible for a normal user

Use this one as a minimum transaction rate:
“A billion transactions per day, if evenly distributed (which they surely would not be) would result in about 7 million transactions per block.”
From the James Lopp article

“1 billion transactions per day generates 500GB worth of blockchain data for full nodes to store and process”

If they want to do one on chain transaction every 10 years
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:19:28
Coin join is for privacy not scalability, it uses signature aggregation 
If you have 1000 transaction in one on chain transaction, they are by definition off chain

Here is a good article which does a good job at explaining what a true decentralized exchange is:

Blocknet and NIX protocols combined will be a force to be reckoned with
