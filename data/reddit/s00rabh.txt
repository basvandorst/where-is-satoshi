So if you(or anyone) are ready to help  bitcoin network by running a node 24x7 for a year. How does cost of 50$ HDD/year makes a difference?
Internet is not unlimited?
What is the difference in cost between home network and corporate network that you mightaswell be using if you are running a node in current Bitcoin cenario. 
I still don't see how this will cause centralization. 


So few people owning 90% of mining is not centralization but bigger size blockchain is.
My account is 3 year old and have been looking at bitcoin growth since 2011~12. I am not a troll or being paid by anyone to promote anything.
But it seems you are just being dishonest as to why bigger block won't help.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:01:03
Props if you actually remember your Private key
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:35:01


Yet to be demonstrated as a danger. Plus a working blockchain is better than not working one. Thanks core.


It's an issue with created contracts and not with Ethereum itself. 


PoS &gt; PoW. So I guess worth a risk.


Yep, and lot of people are saying it.

It's cold, I am bald. So a sock for head.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:06:59
I like this idea. Instead something like increase the Blocksize based on Mempool and if Mempool goes small then Blocksize should also be reduced.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:31:22
Forget bitcoin for once. It.must be a hell living there.

Unlike current Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:47:08


That's it?
Your problem is block size? Or 1.6TB space usage a year.
Have a few questions if you could answer. Why would someone wants to run a full node if it doesn't help in any financial way.


Isn't that how it currently is. I mean, you are concerned about centralization because of Chain size but mining is being controlled by few guys only. How is that good in any way.
If anything you want to prevent centralization, asic Miners should be forked out first.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:09:17
Thanks for the answer, I will read more upon this and in a way it does Makes sense. 
But will it be that big of a problem with just 4~8mb Blocksize.?

Do correct if I got it wrong. What you are saying is that due to big blockchain, verification of transaction will take long because system would have to check older blocks. So more the blocks there are, longer it will take.
If my understanding is correct then yes it will slow the system down. But it will not affect just one miner but everyone who wants to explore blockchain or verify transaction.
In this scenario, I don't expect anyone to have TB of SSD to work faster and regular people cannot afford SSD.


Actually, I don't think a regular user would ever want to create their own node(copy of complete blockchain). Specially in. 3rd world country where even a 24x7 unlimited internet connection is still considered expensive.
Plus, the way I understand LN. We have to trust the channel own anyway with our bitcoin. So, isn't trust lost in that sense.


Can a block be made in a way that it changes it size depending on Mempool. So if we see that lots of transaction are stuck then block should automatically increase in size to clear it out. 
I have a question and I think you can answer.
For lighting network to work free if cost(or low fee) all channels must be connected. My problem with this is that I don't see that happening on day one. Heck, many companies still don't use segwit. So aren't core-dev and community putting too much trust in LN to work when for LN to work properly and with low fee it must already be established.
I will use an example if my question is not clear.
Suppose LN has been scheduled to launch on 1Jan2018. Now I would need to pay coffee to Starbucks. I would add Bitcoin on their channel. Now I off to wall Mart and I want to pay then aswell. So I would again have add money to their channel(unless of course Starbuck and wall Mart LN channel can work together)
I personally don't see that happening from day one. And I know it's hard to expect something like this to work from day 1. But by design I think LN should work from day 1 or people would just say it failed.

@_date: 2018-01-11 17:20:52


Wouldn't spamming be impossible or too expensive if your blockchain automatically clears it up. I mean as a spammer I would be loosing a lot of money if the fee is already nominal and transaction are clearing up fine. 
Predicable increase might still be a problem where a Network can be spammed in a day when Mempool is high.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:45:00
I prefer bcash and I still think this statement is wrong. I understand that devs are working on second layer solution but why the f*** would you cripple the current design to a unusable form. 
They could have increased the block size enough to have low few transaction while LN was being developed and finally implemented everywhere.
Do you think that LN would be deployed and working on day 1?
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:07:51
Please explain how increasing block size causes centralization.
So any link.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:52:32
I am weed you
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:00:07


And tell me something, can current BCash block handle current BTC transaction?
If yes then we need while LN comes(Which I am have been reading about for more than a year)
This is not how development works for a mainnet.  You cannot cripple a working product while trying to improve it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:11:28
Isn't BTC mining was supposed to be till 2100's + something.

And you are happy with $6. ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:29:06
See that's the problem. You are not solving anything by saying that a solution will come in future.
I don't support any coin. I support thing that works. And as off now Bitcoin doesn't.
I would be paying a high fee with long wait time just to send my 400$. In BCH I did this 1hr back for 0.000019BCH
I might aswell be blocked for saying this, but Bitcoin in itself is nothing if you cannot accomplish the sole thing it was made to do. Transfer bitcoins from one address to other. People would say you are being spammed. Well so what, your protocol should be strong enough to avoid such attacks.
Ethereum has a good work plan, IOTA is looking really good. It would be a sad day if ever(and I hope not) Bitcoin is replaced by these two cause surely BCash is not going to replace Bitcoin.
As an outsider it seems r/Bitcoin is soo much concerned about BCash that you are forgetting that there are other coins with much much much better usage, fee and value.
That should concern you more.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:13:49

I don't think it would be a problem. 1Tb blocks are being tested and I don't see them coming on anytime soon. By the time they do come in our storage capacity would have increased drastically.
Plus I think better option would be to go with variable block size. Depending on number of transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:37:06


If that's the case then maybe for contracts but there is more to it.
The biggest for me is wasted resources in POW system like Bitcoin. Set number of coins makes much more sense  now that we have XRB and IOTA.

For once I might have got it and I will try explaining.
I shop at Wal-Mart and they took my phone number the first time I went there. From here on My phone number is registered and when ever I do shopping, they pull up my details with my phone number.
Now I imagine that I could pay with my Phone number. And now that I am on wall Mart records, Costco can check my data with my phone number if I give them my number. So I can pay them aswell. Like always, I need to have money loaded on my mobile wallet.
Please correct me if I understood the comparison.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:56:20
What now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:05:44


So what if I do have to send it to an exchange? I normally would not use BTC for payments. Not for next 5 years until business here in India starts accepting it.


I know that. But my point is, considering block size, I still don't see fee going down.
As you said people would be using LN for payments. But for people who don't, it would still cause high fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:29
Or you could just donate few. Starting with a small BTC donation to me if you can.
Would be off great help.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:27:52


Part of the solution is first accepting the problem. I was supportive of Bitcoin.
Now I wait when I get banned by these idiotic mods. I understand if someone openly advertise another cryptocurrency. But I have seen people getting banned for just pointing out problem with the core team. They at least should grow some balls before trying to grow LN or segwit.

Not sure of this answer. If anyone could let us know. How much of the transaction can we add in one BCH block.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:34:58
How is that bad?
I don't like to be rude but that is just a stupid way of thinking. I would have more trust on a cryptocurrency if I can move the money when I want.
I have stuff on coinbase and I can only move my BTC by converting them to eth and then sell eth.

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:19


Are you sure that it will not get cheaper? Like instead of paying 10$ for a transaction we would be still be paying anything around that.
Do you have any proof to support your statement?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:00
Yep, agreed
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:32:04


No, you don't understand. I have 1Btc and need to send 0.07 to bittrex to buy something else. I am not going to lock 1Btc just for sending 0.07(which also will expensive for one time usage)
Not many are going to lock there BTC in a payment channel. Every payment channel in the world could be connected but locking your BTC is the only thing which many people would not consider.


Not true aswell, unless we see real world usage. Plus this will not protect against current spam attack(considering if there is any). Anyone would still send low fee transaction to fill the block just to cause slow down. And as I understand, if some transaction is in mempool for 3 days then it's removed.


Again, I personally don't think it's worth it when I have to lock my BTC. I like have control over my own stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:04:51

Ohh there is no man in clouds. Except maybe the people on a plane.

By Technical standpoint, Ethereum as a platform is far better.
Bitcoin is like gold, while ethereum has a use.
I also like IOTA, no transaction fee that can really be turned into micro-transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:08:50
PM me if interested. I can do it
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:22:24
And from my perspective core's idea is fake and real BTC is close to BTC Cash.
To each it's own. I do wish both increase cause I have both.

It definitely is.

True story

Not Bitcoin, coin-bits
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:29:44


You would be surprised for how less people have been banned. 
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:09:09
I like this because it's true. One of those lines would be the closest.
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:31:18
I currently cannot use BTC cause it's cheaper to send transaction any other way. So maybe I am alone on this one.
And before anyone ask, yes. I do use crypto to pay few invoices for services I use for my business.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:06:17
Oh no, I cannot afford the fee.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:44:01
Someone should give him a gold. I am too poor to afford one.

Or how Trump's brain works when trying to form a sentence
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:32:19
Let it be mine. It is 9243 on sell in India.
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:25:42
So there is no other project which is cheaper than BTC which is unconfiscatable, decentralized and secure?
Where have you been?
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:49:26
BHwahah, had a really good laugh while eating. Happy to know I didn't choke on my food.
Lol worthy
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:11:30


Cheaper/faster/better != Bitcoin as of now.
I will use what I can without giving away money for free.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:41:52
Yes, and buy 9500
@_date: 2017-04-05 08:37:28
Thanks for this. Issue like high fee when not being addressed is the reason I finally decided to move away from Bitcoins.
I as a user don't know or care if BU/Classic/core is the real way to go. (Personally core does feel like business oriented and being controlled to kill BTC)
All I know is that I am spending too much for a simple transaction that I can avoid with another cryptocurrency which is showing future use.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:46:17
If it makes you feel better. I did purchase few and sold off early (no because there was a profit but I was in need of money that I just invested)
I would have been worth couple of millions now.
More so same thing happened when I bought ethereum (plus lost about 20 or so ether in a scam)
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:03:38
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:42:43
Yep, my first thought as well. 
Scams around this could be easy and vast. It depends on how easy it is to manipulate the user.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:02:57
To think of it. I would give away the pen drive with a test file. He is not smart enough to knock what he wants, I might get away with it. Better chance then nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:57:21
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:43:11
To be fair there are projects far better than Bitcoin. Only advantage of Bitcoin is being the first. I use Bitcoin just because everyone uses it.
I rather use Eth/IOTA if everyone I deal with were to use that.
And yes, I don't like the current structure of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:43:48
Not one bit
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:31:01
Not useful if I am waiting 20min for confirmation. But go on how ETH is not secure.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:03:38
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:02:18
Anyway I would be able to retrieve my lost BTC,?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:11:23
That is a really nice looking cake
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:10:37
Happened bro. I moved out.
Core killed Bitcoins
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:41:47
India, so I would have kept.
And ofcoure, I could have just waited for them to ask for it.
@_date: 2016-05-24 06:47:49
True that

If I was Santoshi then I would have deleted those private keys and made sure I would not remember.
Guessing Santoshi would have done that already.
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:24:34
And this is the reason Bitcoin is getting replaced.
Instead of fixing problems, you people think people are the problem.

Cannot downvote you enough.

@_date: 2016-05-21 15:30:57
This is the reason why Bitcoins will die.
Instead of innovation, people rely on shortcuts.

Better, buy Venezuela. Get oil to backup BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-02 06:53:26
Exactly, that statement is just wrong.
Gold has far more use case than Bitcoin. Heck Bitcoin only job as off now to transfer funds from one place to another is being done a lot better by few Alts.

I could not downvote you enough.
Core is cancer, they have successfully killed majority gains of Bitcoins.
