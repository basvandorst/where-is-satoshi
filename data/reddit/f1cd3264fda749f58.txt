Nothing wrong with that; just don't store 1 billion dollars there and you're fine.

Huh, why is it banned? That's bullshit! Source or more info on this??
@_date: 2013-03-30 13:58:09
Yep. Same as lost wallets and hidden, long forgotten treasures (gold) in "real life".

Receiving and sending payment in Bitcoin using e.g. phones is very, very easy. No partners needed.
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:13:23
Hmh! Never seen that before. Nice. :)

..or, hm, well; multiple clients for the same currency – which is what the author wants; a better client.

To fund the Vietnam war via hidden taxation via inflation.

Yeah, guys; use another exchange. Some have lower fees or even no fees!

People will be "forced" to spend their coins as they rise in value. It balances out automatically.

What do you mean? The sellers probably has a QR code people can scan using their phones. This gives buyers the correct address to send payment to without them tediously having to type in a Bitcoin address.

Maybe, I'm not sure. We can't really know whether someone owns 25% anyway – and I don't think anyone owning that amount of coins would want to ruin the Bitcoin economy with its unique benefits which they now are a big, big part of.

Transaction fees will keep people mining.

A relic of the past. :)

Yeah, they should just say "we also accept Bitcoin!" or something. The Android client can convert from/to USD &lt;--&gt; BTC on the spot with up to date rates.

I'm not following. This guy sitting on a ton of coins doesn't mean the smaller guys can't trade with each other using the coins they have – as a medium of exchange for the things *they can* provide and buy.
The big guy will want to buy bigger things because he can. Bigger house, bigger car, etc. – I don't see how this ruin things for anyone else?
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:51:52
He's right. 0 confirmations is fine if you're not selling a house or a car – and a (0 confirmation) transaction is visible on e.g.  after waiting like one second.
@_date: 2013-03-31 08:45:37
Yes, they run a Bitcoin client on a laptop – or they can just refresh, say  to confirm that the transaction has gone through to their address.
For coffee and stuff like this they don't have to wait around for 6 confirmations; 0 confirmations is enough. Also, there's this thing called "green addresses", but I haven't researched those or whether that might be useful here.

Yeah, make sure you still have both kidneys when you wake up! :P
