I decided to try this as their buy rate is lower than in [Safello]( or [Coinmotion]( The site responds, lets me register and request a deposit ticket.
Some notes:
- "Create account" button doesn't react if e-mail address contains a plus sign (which is valid)
- e-mail address in Account Settings is blank even though an e-mail address was asked when registering
- no two-factor authentication
- no instant deposit (like SOFORT/Paybyway offered by Safello and Coinmotion), only bank transfer
- "Save" button doesn't react in the "Account Settings" dialog
- some English translations missing
- The XBTUSD, XBTEUR and LTCEUR rates looked funky at first – all were exactly 9223372036.85478. XBTNOK, LTCNOK and LTCUSD looked strange (albeit smaller) as well first. Some minutes later, all rates changed into reasonable values.
- the "Buy XBT" and "Sell XBT" dialogs do create, reject (with "reason code" 4 or 5) and remove an order even though I have zero balances
I requested a deposit ticket and received deposit instructions for SEPA by e-mail, but decided to not proceed at this time.

What if he destroyed, among all other evidence, also all his private keys (both Bitcoin and PGP) when he got scared of Gavin going to talk with the CIA?

There is no reliable way to "clean you machine of viruses, malware, etc.". Please suggest booting into a clean OS (e.g. a trusted LiveCD or live USB stick) instead.
Please suggest disconnecting the computer from the Internet while generating the wallet, and most importantly, whenever the password is entered or is present in the memory. Also, a reboot must be done before connecting again.
Humans are generally not capable to come up with a 16-character strong password. Please suggest including enough of truly random characters in the password (generated by throwing dice, taking cards from a shuffled deck etc).
The text editor may write the password in a temporary file and/or a swap file on the hard drive even if the user only saves the file on the USB drive. Even if it removes the temporary file, the data stays on the media and may be recoverable. Again, booting from CD or USB and not mounting the hard drive is safer.
Once the cold wallet is brought into an on-line computer, it becomes a hot wallet and can't reliably be turned back into a cold wallet again. All funds must be spent or sent to a new cold wallet. 
If your instructions are targeting novice users who won't be capable of running Armory or other sophisticated cold wallet solutions, please at least include the above suggestions to improve the security of your method.

Mine arrived today. First impressions:
- first setup on Firefox/Ubuntu failed with an error message (although details in the wallet app still looked ok; I used 18 words recovery, PIN code and passphrase)
- the support e-mail address bounces my e-mails back (which I reported this to their info e-mail address)
- wiped and re-did the setup on Chrome/Ubuntu, no error message this time
- received bitcoins into the mytrezor wallet and saw them in the balance
- I closed and disconnected everything, then opened and connected again – wallet connects but doesn't show transaction, and the "Send" tab is disabled

I went to see one of these Deltacom bitcoin vending machines in the Länsisatama harbour terminal.
The vending machine greeted me with a Windows XP login screen. I logged in using the touchscreen and got the Windows XP desktop. The kiosk software didn't run automatically.
In the notification area Windows warned me about possible security risks, but I didn't pay attention to see if it was about the lack of firewall or virus protection or something else.
There were a few icons on the desktop, and the name of one of them said something about "kiosk", so I ran it. It opened what looked like their UI in a browser, and a numeric keypad window on top of it. I couldn't close the keypad window so I double-tapped and dragged to move it out of the way.
I managed to navigate to the bitcoin instructions. Their price was 500€ while bitcoinaverage.com said about 380€. I decided to not buy.
I took the subway to the main railway station to buy on bittiraha.fi's Lamassu machine instead. The user experiences on Deltacom and Lamassu are like night and day. On the Lamassu you touch "start", show your QR code, feed bills and touch "pay", that's all. On the Deltacom machine I had to face the whole Windows touchscreen horror and a bad exchange rate.
I'm sorry to have to say that I hope Deltacom disables their bitcoin service on these machines until they get the user interface problems fixed. The machines as they are now are harmful to bitcoin.
**Update:** [some photos from the screen](

I'm torn about the ecological viability of Bitcoin mining in the long run. It seems to me that if Bitcoin goes mainstream and the value of newly mined coins grows 1000-fold, the total money (and thus energy) spent on mining will grow ~1000-fold as well.
What is your take on this? Do you think Bitcoin adoption will grow to such proportions at all? Or will it happen slowly enough that the diminishing block reward keeps energy spent on mining on a reasonable level? Is the mining algorithm practically immutable, and are critics of proof-of-stake correct when they say PoS isn't a viable mining system?

What would be the simplest viable export format? I know of [OFX]( [IIF]( and [QIF]( Or, maybe a simple CSV format would be enough?
* contact cryptocurrency tax and accounting solution providers (like [LibraTax]( and [Coyno]( and ask what kind of format would make sense for them to import
* see if there's enough common between current existing export formats in cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges
Apart from these, I don't think there's much else to do than to convince software and service providers to sit down together and figure out a common standard?

When scanning the keys for verification, it's important to boot the computer from a live CD.  Otherwise you'll have to destroy the hard drive afterwards since there probably are traces of the private key QR code in swap space or temporary files. 
Also, keep the computer off-line during the process (disconnect ethernet cable, and disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the BIOS). 
The mobile phone must be off-line when scanning the private key QR code (no SIM card,  and disable Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth and NFC),  and you must destroy the phone immediately afterwards. 
I wouldn't store significant amounts in the etched address without these precautions.
