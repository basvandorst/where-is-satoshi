Paying a 1%(!) fee for a 24h withdrawal and not getting it for weeks is understandable?
@_date: 2019-03-29 02:14:12
I'm just not sure how a financial institution not having finances adds up to "reasonable".
Also a 1% fee for a withdrawal is HUGE. OP paid through the fucking nose for that service, and still got screwed.

There are many users who never interact with the web GUI at all. Real traders aren't clicking around on bitmex.com

Most of the shorting happening on CME (and elsewhere) is done to hedge a position. That is useful for all kinds of trading applications. It isn't just about betting against something.

That did not answer the question

But this is like saying you want to shoot someone *else's* gold into the sun

An exchange could let you sell fractions of a coin, since you aren't trading "real" coins in that context (this actually happens with NEO on Binance, for example).
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:00:00
Uh it's binance. You can't withdraw fractions of a neo, but there is no reason why you can't trade it when no coins are really moving.
If btc were to increase in price enough that fractions of sats were meaningful in value, you would almost certainly be trading some token representing that value, but the principle is similar.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:18:26
No obviously not for btc. If the price of btc went up massively (and/or a huge portion of the supply were burned) it could theoretically become practical, but it isn't now.
Like I said though, they do actually do this now for other coins, so it is little odd to say they would never do it

What 300 video are you talking about? And what is this about a 6k wall? That TA stuff is unrelated to long term predictions, confusing the two is dangerous.
I'd ask what the hell you're doing trading options without knowing anything about this stuff, but I already know the answer is WSB.

Evidence indicates that you are mistaken about this. Someone got in your wallet and copied your seed phrase.
Carrying a seed phrase around like that is a very very bad mistake. You said this btc was a significant portion of your net worth. You were basically carrying all of your money around in your pocket, in cash (except worse, because it can be stolen without you even noticing). I feel like it's probably obvious why that is a bad idea.
Sorry, but there is no way to get your bitcoin back.

Wow you seem to have really upset some morons around here, based on that other reply
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:39:23
That... Isn't what frontrunning means. At all. And what games are you talking about? 
Besides, if this trend is real you can trade it. Identifying that a coin is correlated to another, but with greater volitility, would be IDEAL to trade. Why would that be a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:42:53
Then what do you do?
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:28:53
Not sure why you think that, but that isn't true at all

It's totally normal that this kind of activity accounts for most of the volume of a market
