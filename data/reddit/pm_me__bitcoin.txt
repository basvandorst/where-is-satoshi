Isnt this kind of a good thing? It's exposing a flaw in Bitcoin tech that should be addressed: The network in it's current state is susceptible to low level attacks.
Lats find a solution

If I control the printing of Tether, I can print 5 million of them, and trade them for Bitcoin at Bitcoins current price. Then sell that Bitcoin for USD somewhere else.
Then I print 5 million more Tether for nothing. Buy BTC  with it, and sell it or trade it somewhere else. 
So what if I keep doing this and flood the market with Tether? Just keep buying BTC and trading it to other coins? It inflates the entire market with fake dollars
Edit: Inversely, if I destroy Tethers whenever I want, it reduces the number available, "raising" their value. But  since the value is always $1, it just lowers the value of all other coins paired with it. Sell coins to usdt, then destroy them, lowering the whole market. Not as directly profitable this way though

I thought Bitcoin was more of a store of value like digital gold than for everyday use like a digital cash

Yay, BTC is almost not a shitcoin!

And costs like ,05-.25 USD(or something). You just don't see it cause the business owner pays it.

With a decentralized currency - he's not wrong...

When the 'trolls' outnumber the 'real users', you might just be wrong...

ATMs also limit you to just $300/day withdraw 
@_date: 2018-06-22 10:59:17
So then why is BTC having high fees ok?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:51:11
No need to be an asshole. I was just answering his question, i never said 'trade all your BTC for BCH'...
That's interesting though about the support on Jan 1st. I read an article that just said the word 'support', not the coinbase memo which your right does say its only for withdrawal. Damn fake news...
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:17:58
No one should make you own anything, i agree. So wrong. Here, just send that BCC my way and I'll take that burden from you
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:23:58
Mem pool for BTC is full. Btc refuses to scale by increasing block size. The small increase that was planned for the 16th has been cancelled. All the big blockers and people who wanted 2c free coins are pulling out. It's good timing to move to BCH too because it will be supported on coinbase on Jan 1
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:59:01
You think anyone that is confused at all or asks a question is a troll? Dafuq?
I agree, BCH is unpopular therefore far less valuable than BTC. That's why I hold a lot of BTC, because I think in the end it will be the dominant force and that's what we're all here for right? To make money.
But your argument that BCH can never replace BTC, and that it is broken because it has a smaller marketcap, smaller userbase, and has fewer commits than Bitcoin seems lame. Every coin has a smaller marketcap, smaller userbase, and fewer devs than Bitcoin. Just because BTC is the biggest, doesn't make it the best.

Which is incentive for higher fees to transact. 
Which is incentive to not transact.
Which makes the coin less useful.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:43:45
I'm a little confused here. BTC still has the original name, but neither are really the 'original' Bitcoin. Aren't BTC and BCH both technically modified versions of the 'original' coin? BTC has Segwit/lightning. BCH has a greatly increased blocksize.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:04:26
So Bitcoin as it was before August 1st is still exactly the same, it just runs on legacy nodes in the BTC chain, a chain which also allows for upgrading to use of Segwit?
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:18:11
Good catch. wouldn't have noticed
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:14:08
You still had to learn by setting up that Western Union account, learn how to use checks, a credit card, and your online account. Bitcoin is no different. Accept that you have to re-learn how currency works and it's no problem.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:38:43
Nice! Love this analogy. 
The bigger BTC gets the more people will bandwagon. Not only that but everyone who gets onboard will likely invest in a 2nd or 3rd option as well and carry up the price of surrounding coins. Just keep hodling!
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:15:23
They are scarce and there's not much competition, so they kind of get to fuck you on exchange rate. ATMs in bars are no different

I apologise for my stupid question in advance as well. If you have an electrum wallet, is there any other step you need to take? Or is having coins in the electrum wallet (and keeping your seed words on hand of course) fine? Also things like keepkey and trezors
@_date: 2017-06-13 12:46:23
I bought a keepkey. Maybe I'm just an idiot but I kept sending little amounts to it to test and ended up losing $20. I can't make the damn thing work.
