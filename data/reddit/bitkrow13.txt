Can someone say Photoshopped. Someone took a screenshot and edited it by inserting that line. Check out Boom Bust - Its a financial show hosted by the lady in the image. They even have the price of BTC in the closing bell.

Says it all really, from all accounts of what I've heard about Satoshi Nakamoto's writing, he was very consicise and understood the English Language well. He articulated his thoughts extremely well. I doubt he would have used Cryptopunk to answer that question...

I agree that hes an early adopter, he claims to be an academic and has the credentials to match. He might have access to the super computer, how likely is it that he used this to mine later on...? I doubt hes Satoshi, why would Satoshi come out now, even after 5 years the average guy on the street has no fucking clue about BTC, or might have heard it on the news as something that can be used to buy drugs....but that's about it. If he was Satoshi, wouldn't he choose to remain anonymous until it actually got some proper traction?? I'm prepared to be downvoted, but would like to see a proper discussion with regards to my points?

All media in places like US, CHINA, FRANCE, UK, RUSSIA are state sponsored. In the US, there are 6 Corporations that fed you the news, they also own most of the newspapers/radio etc. and they have to get a liscence from Washington DC in order to continue running. They receive their talking points from the White House on foreign policy issues and only when it's blatanly obvious will they try not be be biased. You would think that after the events of the IRAQ war, Americans would wake up and take note of the BS that comes from corporate mainstream media, but no.....RT will obviously try to cover stories that are not shown by the US/UK in order to show them in bad light, but in reality they are exposing things that those governments are trying to keep hidden from the public. Ofcourse RT wont cover issues which make Russia look bad, but that does not mean you take the the stories by CNN, FOX, BBC et al as truth when they cover countries like China/Russia, developing world. They have been caught lying on numerous occasions and have lost credibility. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:24:08
I don't like how sites like FOX, Daily mail are pushing BTC. The audiences for these publications are probably not going to be tech savvy and it seems like they are trying to pump up the price....
@_date: 2015-12-03 03:57:15
Unfortunately if they are manage to do this, they will most likely be successful. Despite the number of cases of Fraud, the big banks still hold a lot of credibility when compared to something like BTC. They also have a lot of $$$ to throw into PR and Marketing and i think for the average person, if they can say something like, we can remit your $$$ for 75% of what it used to cost you, they will still retain a lot of customers and maybe even draw new ones in....sigh

This is the future for the US and Europe. Negative Interest rates will lead to the demise of Fiat in my opinion. You'll start to see the smart money move into cryptos and precious metals and this will eventually lead to the masses coming on board. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 11:43:45
Yeah i totally concur, its funny how this 7-8 year bubble cycles work, enough to get the next generation of suckers into stocks whilst the bag holders dump. Rinse and repeat in another 7-8 years.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:12:34
I watched it a few years ago. Even if your not really into economics or finance, its a great doco to watch. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:20:41
I think the reference points to an early adopter with a lot of coin, who believes the price of BTC will go cheaper, so they try to push it down to buy at a lower price. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 15:06:00
Damn my bad lol. I've actually watched that doco a few months back. Awesome doco in my opinion. Inside Job was the first film that actually got me thinking about economics, was based on the 2007/08 GFC but the way it was portrayed showed capitalism in a really bad light, even though what they were depicting was actually crony capitalism.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:14:09
It could be, "they" do afterall have access to cheap credit, which they could use to buy bitcoin, of the exchanges, and then dump it to push the price down. Its hard to say though, to many factors which affect price.
@_date: 2014-07-12 13:43:28
Heard about BTC in 2012 from the Keiser Report. It was only until mid 2013, that i actually started looking into it. Finally bought my first BTC in Decemeber 2013 at its peak lol. I think the idea is great and its going to be very disruptive to the banking industry, which has been allowed to leech of society for far too long. It allows the average person to manage their own money and do business across borders. Have talked to a few friends about it, but none of them have really taken much interest....
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:37:15
Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2014-10-23 05:31:54
Cool, so do i just download one of those wallets and then send the coins over to the multibit/electrum wallet address? Can i then delete the bitcoin-qt wallet from my comp and will that free up the 12 or so gigs which has been used to download the blockchain, this is the part which i'm iffy about.
@_date: 2014-10-08 13:14:11
Paul Krugman, has no real understanding of how disruptive technology works, the fact that he thought the internet was going to fail, is more than enough to dismiss anything he says. I wouldn't take any economic advice from him either. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 04:27:43
I think the Chinese are playing it smart. They already have their own currency swap agreements with a number of countries including Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Russia, Switzerland, Germany, UK and are in works to get others on board including Argentina and other Latina American countries. They have also been accumulating lots of gold and are buying hard assets in a number of countries. I think they will continue to hoard precious metals and once they feel that enough countries are confident in the Yuan, they will dump US Treasuries along with the other BRICS countires. Once that starts, Central Banks around the world will do the same. 10K per bitcoin sounds crazy today, but in 5 years could be a reality. Will have to wait and see.

I like the passion he brings to his shows, and he has some awesome guests as well. Will definitely check out the renegadeeconomist, thanks :) 
I have an interest in economics, especially austrian economics and the idea of sound money. So Bitcoin really struck a cord, plus i think millennial males are somewhat tech savvy so the idea of having digital money, in a digital age makes perfect sense. Especially when governments can't counterfeit it and virtually have no control over it. I think cryptos are the peoples money. I dream of the day when people can use a basket of cryptos for trade and commerece.
None of my friends are really interested in economics either or concerned about who our current fiat and banking systems work. I think the next crisis will wake up a lot of the younger millennials to the idea of sound money. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:43:55
Yes i'd like to see that.

Check out James D'Angelo of the World Bitcoin Network. He explains the whole bitcoin concept really well. I was absolutely lost, which i first heard about it, and his video series did wonders for helping be grasp the entire concept. Best to watch them with a cup of coffee :)

You never buy an IPO on opening day....or the subsequent days there after. Those luck enough to get into the IPO will dump on you...then buy back later when its bottomed out.

To increase his holdings???
@_date: 2014-09-19 13:13:45
Don't feel bad, i bought my first one at around $980, then bought again around $700 and $650. I think its natural, the ups and downs will continue for a long time. Where i'm from a lot of people still don't know about Bitcoin, and if they've heard about it on the news, they still don't really know what it does, or what it can do. I think mainstream adoption is a long long way off. I would'nt take the loss and hold onto it. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:36:39

@_date: 2015-05-24 01:12:43
Some people are extremely dogmatic in their stance....but that does not mean he can't or won't change his views eventually. I feel that precious metals and crypto are complementary in that, they can be a store of value in the long term. Crypto is incredibly young at the moment, and does not have the history the PM do as stores of value, but they do offer benefits over PM's. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:07:11
Don't click on the post then..Post's like this contribute to the debate and unlike you, i feel topics like this contribute to the discussion. There people from outside the BTC sub that also visits here, some might be invested in precious metals, and reading posts like this can give them further insight as to whether they should diversify some part of their precious metals into crypto. No one's forcing you to click on this post.

Do you have a link to Keiser saying that? Would love to check it out
@_date: 2015-05-25 11:08:46
DASH is actually a clone of litecoin, but has now implemented bitcoin core 0.10 i believe. Would be interested to see if the BTC network would even consider a hardfork. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:38:44
Can someone provide a source?

It's like asking a banker what to do with ones money? Obviously hes going to say "give it to me!"

My thoughts exactly. If it was photo shopped, they did a really good job!
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:41:41
I'd rather it be another coin, than the banking cabal. I've already had long term investors move out from BTC into some of the other promising alternatives based on the block size debate. Bitcoin pretty much stagnated in 2015, and i think if the same happens in 2016, that'll be the end.

US Stock markets are crashing because of the anticipated rate hike in September...(it won't happen but this is a preemptive move) and if it does happen, it will be tiny increase and then we move to QE4 (can't have a tanking economy during election season) 
The smart money (generally older and less technical heads) will move part of their holdings into physical gold. 
Traditionally its always been a safe haven in times of crisis. Others have already been buying the US dollar, its part of the reason along with a rate rise why the dollar has rallied so much, but again it's not sustainable and your going to have a lot of US corporations lobbying to have the dollar brought down cause its hurting their earnings. 
Bitcoin is to tiny and far to risky to put money into, it also requires some technical expertise to feel comfortable using. Most average people don't really have a lot of cash lying around, and again are not technically savvy enough to get bitcoin.
They are most likely to buy precious metals or put it into tangible assets (I'm talking about those smart enough to see a crisis) 
I do believe though that there are a lot of people in the know, that have got out of BTC, that might come back if we see more carnage. This issue revolving around a Fork is not helping either...so who knows. 
I truly believe that Gold is still going to be seen as a safe haven....because its always been one. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 12:48:43
I agree, we are not there yet. Central Banks still need to lose full control, and when that happens i think physical gold will probably be magnitudes higher than what Bitcoin will trade for.

Exactly, it would be hard to believe that this rally is based on the halving? I mean that was well known.....I see this as a similar pump to the one we had a little while ago, where it got dumped hard....not hating - just pointing it out. But yeah i'd like to see where we go ;)
