I think a fork makes it seem less appealing to the average person, less legitimate. As that one guy said "we'll all hang together, or we'll all hang separately"

Isn't this kind of a lie? I've had to wait hours up to days for a certain number of confirmations.

I'm doing the same as you. I bought my miners as a way to buy in.

"the transactions were meant to be public." Then what is the block chain?
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:59:35
Japanese exchanges, for example, won't let you deposit funds from an American bank, and Japanese banks won't let a non-citizen open an account. Also, it can take days if not weeks to buy/sell. So if you can open an account with the foreign exchange, deposit an amount of money, then you could profit from it. But you will have to take into account bank fees and exchange fees, fees from the BTC network are negligible.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:44:02
I'm not sure what Bitpay's policy is, but most exchanges require 6 confirmations, and there should be a confirmation every 10 min.

Well I think there's 2 different ways value could be calculated: VS USD, based off of supply and demand, more people want BTC, the price goes up etc; usefullness, people can use BTC more often, so it becomes more preferred.

People would just go to other exchanges like BTC-E, MT. GOX, or Bitstamp. And companies have multiple choices in accepting payments. Bitpay has a large number of sellers, and a payment processor isn't even necessary, all it requires is an address and you can accept payments.

You can either use something like Coinbase or Bitpay, or you can have your customers send the Bitcoins to an address. A cool "verification" method I saw someone use for the second method, is to have the customer send you the price for the service plus a random amount of Satoshis.

Ah bonjour mon ami, comment ca va? If you're looking to make the most profit then buying Bitcoins is your best bet. If you don't mind making less in profit, then you can expect to spend at least 6k USD on an ASIC. Hashfast has a good reputation of making high quality miners an delivering on time. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, you could buy a couple(5+) USB block erupters and holding onto the BTC they mine and hope the price goes up to 10k+.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:52:08
I don't, sorry.

I wouldn't say they're doing great right now, I bought 6 when they were around $15 USD each and I've mined about .025. They difficulty has been going up, but the last jump wasn't insane, and who knows when a large batch of hardware might come online. If you can get a couple within the next 2 weeks for around $20 USD, and have free/cheap electricity, it wouldn't be a terrible idea. But again, more profit buying than mining.

I've always wanted to be a pornstar! Oh wait, I'm Asian...
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:33:43
Obviously, it's magic internet money.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:58:58
That would create a centralized body, which is the opposite of Bitcoins.

What happens to the BTC that people donated if SSI doesn't purchase it?
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:05:43
I can't wait to get my bonus from the Navy to really get into Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:49:12
Do my block erupters count as a spoon or a toothpick?
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:03:32
It mines Bitcoins, Devcoins, Ixcoins, and Namecoins, which are all SHA-256, so it takes the same work to all blockchains. So you'll get the same amount of bitcoins, but you'll also receive alt-coins for the same work.

*The BTC

As someone once said, never say never.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:21:06
This brings another question: will there be BTC lines of credit?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:37:10
The chances of you making the same address as someone else is extremely low.

Don't spend the 68 satoshis you find.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:16:55
I wanna know so bad. It's just like the safe all over again.
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:16:05
We can send this shit up it can't go down (all the way, hopefully, not soon)
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:14:49
No, cause you didn't make any money.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:34:17
It took 5 business days.
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:54:55
Regardless of the order, you still attempted to withdraw from an account that didn't have the funds.
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:44:24
You're spending it, not selling it. But honestly, the gov't isn't going to stop you if you want to give it more money, so do what you think you have to, or talk to a financial advisor.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:13:48
If you want to mine, BFL isn't a good company to buy from.
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:08:50
Perhaps they want the money now to, maybe, invest in Bitcoins.

What pisses me off is that he took the loan. He says "stop the parasitic loans" like he was forced to take the loan. He agreed to pay back the loan with interest. If you don't feel like going into debt to go to college you have other options: find a nice paying manual labor job, get a job and take what classes you can afford, join the military.

Coinwarz.com has calculators for pretty much every currency.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:41:38
You can send Bitcoins through email or SMS with Coinbase (and if he buys a Bitcoin, you both get $5)
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:27:46
It was their fault. They gave it to the wrong address. You're free to keep it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:42:07
But you're only 10???
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:30:54
You gained value, not money. Let's say you buy a house. You do a lot of work on it, make it look nicer. Do you pay gains when you fix it up? No, you pay property tax, and sales tax when/if you sell the house.

And a block erupter sells for $50 on Amazon...

What can't you fund with Bitcoins?

Does it say what the hash rate is?

It's like one of those digger things at parks.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:00:57
I don't see any chance of that happening. There are many companies manufacturing and developing ASICs. KNC, BFL, ASICminer, Bitfury, Hashfast just to name a few
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:40:32
Have you contacted Navy Fed and Coinbase?

Some people say "Satoshi" was actually a Brit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:59:09
It might be a more attractive option, it's designed specifically for merchants.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:06:20
You're not going to get anything with "a few old systems"
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:33:36
Because people are tired of a few dissatisfied people complaining and making it seem like Coinbase has a large problem.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:18:46
With 1.5Gh/s, I've earned .015 in the past month and a half. If the price of BTC goes into the 1000s, I'll have made money.
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:14:05
But remember, you only have to pay when you convert back to USD.
@_date: 2013-11-15 06:43:46
Then what's to stop people receiving, i.e. merchants, from charging the customer the extra for the fee?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:41:43
As long as computer networks exist, Bitcoins in some form can be used, and you can buy with BTC, you don't have to convert to fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:01:21
But it's not a big enough portion, they're just very vocal.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:05:07
Yay for entrepreneurship and Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:09:36
US law, as far as I know, can't require anyone to accept or not accept any kind of payment. That power resides with the States.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:45:11
Bitcoin has a lower transaction fee for merchants, large amounts are easily available without having to deal with a bank, international transactions are easier and allows a company to expand at tier own will.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:05:36
He'd still have a lot of power, I don't know anyone who would want to go near those wrinkly everything.

When a bull attacks, it swings it's horns in an upward motion. So people who think that the market will go up are described as "bullish". When a bear attacks, it swings it's paws down. So when someone thinks the market will go down, they are described as "bearish".

If the price reaches 5k my miners will have already reached ROI. But I could have made about 2k profit if I bought Bitcoins.

I don't know, apparently there's an IRC channel

Can you do it through BTC China?

Their price is an Invitation to Barter. Unless they kept your money it's not a contract.

Ebay? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:43:04
Did they do one? I remember people joking saying they should make one about BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:43:50
So that's a no.

I know of a company that is coming out with a NFC gadget for Bitcoins soon.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:02:01
Do you know what is causing that?
