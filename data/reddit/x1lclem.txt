I have their card. It’s a little onerous loading it, but it works. Only complaint I had was that when my wallet got stolen and I needed a replacement card, it took a long time to get a response from them. I think the Shift card which links to your coinbase account is much better.

Segwit is not a silver bullet. Even if All tx's in the mempool used it, the mempool is currently 175MB.... 2mb blocks would barely make a dent in that. We have a dire short-term need to increase the blocks UNTIL Lightning is ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:31
At this point I’ve given up predicting. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:10:11
There is no link between coinbase and Bitpay.  With the Bitpay Visa card, you need to go to the Bitpay website and log in, then type in how much $$ worth of bitcoin you want to load the Visa card with. Bitpay generates a QR code and you use whatever wallet you want to send the BTC to them. As soon as it’s got 3 confirmations, Bitpay credits the Visa card with the US dollars. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:49:34
I have it. What would you like to know?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:09:52
You miss the point. Ideally, lightning would be ready for gum purchasing. But it's not. Adoption needs to happen, and these high fees are suffocating it.

Please consider the Ronald McDonald House of Albany for your charitable donations this year. Any amount, no matter how small, helps. It is one of the most deserving charities, serving families all over upstate NY by providing lodging and accommodations when they must travel to Albany for serious pediatric care.

Bitcoin is a car. It's going 15mph and slowing down. We have 100 miles to go before mass adoption. And only short window to get it there. 
Bitcoin CAN go 60mph if you increase the block size. 
Segwit is a new set of tires. Better MPG but not going to speed you up unless you're going down hill. 
Lightning is a new and fancy engine, but we don't have time to swap the engine out until AFTER We've reached mass adoption. The race will be over soon.

Long story short, this little girl lost her father and siblings in an arson fire a couple years ago.

If you define doubling of transactions in a short period, (say a week), as a "spike" then yes, we can handle it now. 
But what about triple, quadruple, or even a 10x jump? 
Then, likely not. 
One one thing we CAN handle though, is a big DROP in transactions. Its just way less fun.

Agreed. People who use it kind of remind me of cult members. (myself included). We're genuinely excited about something that nobody else seems to care about. 
We should all take a more simple attitude, "Well, this is better than using credit cards, and it may accrue value over time. I'll buy some bitcoin to save and some bitcoin to spend and that'll be the end of it". 
But...... no. Instead, we're on reddit.comevery waking moment, our twitters are overrun with bitcoin posts, our facebook friends have blocked us because WE CAN'T HELP OURSELVES and we post every single article in the WSJ or the NYT that talks about bitcoin, and lord help anyone in person who asks about it or brings it up because they're now stuck in a good 20 minute conversation they probably didn't sign up for.

They will be necessary forever. Bitcoins will only ever be a third spending option to cash and credit cards. Hopefully the preferred option, but it won't kill the need for the other two.

I've decided I don't like GA or Authy. Initially, I was excited to not have to rely on Text messages (vile things, those SMS messages) but then: I had to replace my phone a few times in the past couple months. The phone replacement was on warranty, and the replacement they sent was bad, so I did the whole exercisee TWO more times. Long story short: You can't "Back up" the Authy/GoogleAuth codes and restore them ont he new phone. You have to go into the websites (I had 10 of them set up) and manually disable 2 factor auth, and then you can add your new phone. And most of them require Authy/GoogleAuth to be working in order to shut off 2 factor auth. I was lucky my old phone was still functioning when I had to switch hardware. For someone who loses or damages thier phone, you're SOL. 
A SMS message does not require all that nonsense when you need to switch hardware. Not worth it.

I'm going to be copy/pasting this response in a lot of posts, I feel like. 
Don't chime in until you've read the summary. These proposals are geard more towards protecting consumers than protecting established banking. 
So, I took a look here: These regs have my approval. 
The proposal is organized into the following categories, which by definition, **are almost all good things:**
* Safeguarding consumer assets (Number 1 on the list. It reads: Each firm must hold Virtual Currency of the same type and amount as any Virtual Currency owed or obligated to a third party. Companies are also prohibited from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, pledging, or otherwise encumbering assets, including Virtual Currency, it stores on behalf of another person).
* Virtual Curency Reciepts
* Consumer complaint policies (for resolving consumer complaints)
* Consumer disclosures (Don't lie about risks or vulnerabilities)
* Anti-Money Laundering (I.E. report suspected fraud, verify account holders)
* Cyber Security program (I.E. you HAVE to use website security. Not optional.)
* Chief Information Security officer (I.E. you need a guy who's in charge of security. Not optional)
* Independed DFS Examination (I.E. you can't just PROMISE you have sufficient funds, you need to prove it, regularly)
* Books and records (show your work.)
* Reports and Financial disclosures, Audit requirements (again, to protect consumers)
* Capital requirements (they've got some formula to determine how much cash you need to keep on hand. This Is out of my understanding)
* Compliance Officer (Appoint a guy who's job is to be aware of all the rules and regulations, and make sure they're followed. Otherwise, they won't get followed)
* Business continuity and Disaster recovery (I.E. have a plan. Be prepared. Don't get goxxed. And if the power goes out, make sure you've got a backup server elsewhere. Remember when Blockchain was down for a few days?)
* Notifications of emergencies or disruptions (Don't be a dick and not tell anyone if you got hacked.)

Don't chime in until you've read the summary. These proposals are geard more towards protecting consumers than protecting established banking. 
So, I took a look here: These regs have my approval. 
The proposal is organized into the following categories, which by definition, **are almost all good things:**
* Safeguarding consumer assets (Number 1 on the list. It reads: Each firm must hold Virtual Currency of the same type and amount as any Virtual Currency owed or obligated to a third party. Companies are also prohibited from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, pledging, or otherwise encumbering assets, including Virtual Currency, it stores on behalf of another person).
* Virtual Curency Reciepts
* Consumer complaint policies (for resolving consumer complaints)
* Consumer disclosures (Don't lie about risks or vulnerabilities)
* Anti-Money Laundering (I.E. report suspected fraud, verify account holders)
* Cyber Security program (I.E. you HAVE to use website security. Not optional.)
* Chief Information Security officer (I.E. you need a guy who's in charge of security. Not optional)
* Independed DFS Examination (I.E. you can't just PROMISE you have sufficient funds, you need to prove it, regularly)
* Books and records (show your work.)
* Reports and Financial disclosures, Audit requirements (again, to protect consumers)
* Capital requirements (they've got some formula to determine how much cash you need to keep on hand. This Is out of my understanding)
* Compliance Officer (Appoint a guy who's job is to be aware of all the rules and regulations, and make sure they're followed. Otherwise, they won't get followed)
* Business continuity and Disaster recovery (I.E. have a plan. Be prepared. Don't get goxxed. And if the power goes out, make sure you've got a backup server elsewhere. Remember when Blockchain was down for a few days?)

Here's how it feels: 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:57:04
Go here: 
Download the zip file, un-plug your computer from the internet, and re-start it. 
Once re-started, open the HTML file in the zip you downloaded, and run through the steps to print some wallets. (I always print a bunch). (use a local printer, if possible)
Once they're printed, clear your browser cache and re-start the computer. Plug the internet back in. 
Then send the bitcoins to the public address on the wallet. 
Make sure you put the wallets into a moisture safe container, like a zip-loc baggie. 
That should get the job done. 
You can plug the public address into blockchain.info to watch it over the years.

I do the same. I never "Sell" coin, I spend it. And I usually buy it right back because I'm obsessed with increasing the balance of my wallet. 
I also use coinbase, but have recently been granted a Circle account. for the purposes of instant buys, I think it beats coinbase. No fees. So even if I buy 50 cents of btc, Circle still handles all the bank fees.

Any time a merchant is enabled to accept bitcoin, their costs will be reduced. This will encourage them to promote Bitcoin as their preferred method of payment. 
However, most merchants will immediately convert those bitcoins into cash via Bitpay, GoCoin, and Coinbase. This means that bitcoin hoarders will start to spend thier coins, and the exhanges will be somewhat flooded making the price drop. 
I think that'll be a short-term issue however. In the long term, as Bitcoin adoption among consumers grows, The price will rise.

For example, Gox operated for months after realizing most of their coins were stolen or lost. And did not tell anyone. In that time, lots of people kept putting their coins into gox and will never see them again. These regulations would have meant gox disclosed the losses immediately, saving everyone who deposited for those months from losing coins.

Cannon-C, I think you're missing the point. The regulations are for Bitcoin BUSINESSES, not bitcoin itself. And those regulations come from (for the most part, I still have a lot of it to read) a motivation to protect consumers. 
Things like making sure there's enough liquidity to survive being goxed, to keeping records for a minimum of 10 years, etc. It's common sense stuff that un-regulated (I.E. Mt. Gox) entities might not take into account.

So, if I'm reading that correctly: 
1. When BUYING bitcoin itself, I don't need to pay sales tax. 
2. When using bitcoin to BUY things, (goods and services, let's assume a cheeseburger for now) I DO need to pay sales tax. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:05:13
I feel ya buddy. The future is great, but that don't help us now.

I've had a bunch of my circle deposits get cancelled. 
The support email said they were sorry, and if it happened again they'd like me to reply to the email with a scan of a photo ID and a recent utility bill. 
Do. Not. Ever. Scan those documents, and EMAIL them. HORRIBLY INSECURE. Bad form, circle. Bad form. Back to coinbase for me.

Actually, Overstock.com uses Coinbase, not BitPay. And Overstock does not convert all of the coins to cash, I believe they keep a small percentage.

So, I took a look here: 
The proposal is organized into the following categories, which by definition, **are almost all good things:**
* Safeguarding consumer assets (Number 1 on the list. It reads: Each firm must hold Virtual Currency of the same type and amount as any Virtual Currency owed or obligated to a third party. Companies are also prohibited from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, pledging, or otherwise encumbering assets, including Virtual Currency, it stores on behalf of another person).
* Virtual Curency Reciepts
* Consumer complaint policies (for resolving consumer complaints)
* Consumer disclosures (Don't lie about risks or vulnerabilities)
* Anti-Money Laundering (I.E. report suspected fraud, verify account holders)
* Cyber Security program (I.E. you HAVE to use website security. Not optional.)
* Chief Information Security officer (I.E. you need a guy who's in charge of security. Not optional)
* Independed DFS Examination (I.E. you can't just PROMISE you have sufficient funds, you need to prove it, regularly)
* Books and records (show your work.)
* Reports and Financial disclosures, Audit requirements (again, to protect consumers)
* Capital requirements (they've got some formula to determine how much cash you need to keep on hand. This Is out of my understanding)
* Compliance Officer (Appoint a guy who's job is to be aware of all the rules and regulations, and make sure they're followed. Otherwise, they won't get followed)
* Business continuity and Disaster recovery (I.E. have a plan. Be prepared. Don't get goxxed. And if the power goes out, make sure you've got a backup server elsewhere. Remember when Blockchain was down for a few days?)
* Notifications of emergencies or disruptions (Don't be a dick and not tell anyone if you got hacked.)
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:04:13
Holy *!! this app is GORGEOUS. Fast too.

@_date: 2014-08-21 19:08:25
Huh. Never heard that phrase before. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:42:27
It does not mean you have to give your addy &amp; name to send bticoins to someone. 
This only applies to businesses that manage bitcoins on behalf of users, and only in New York. (Businesses like exchanges and bitcoin merchant software). 
You, as a bitcoin user, will actually benefit from these rules. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:14:57
I buy stuff of overstock.com and then immediately re-stock the btc I spent, adding a little more. So I'm really just spending cash after converting it to BTC.

I'm a coinbase fan. Welcome. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:12:27
I read (ok, I skimmed) the proposal. 
I don't hate it. Keeping records of all transactions for 10 years, assuring liquidity to cover losses and protect consumers, not participating in illegal schemes (I.E. moving drug money), for the most part it seems pretty Reasonable. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 10:59:49

I live in Albany, NY where this thing is. The coffee shop also accepts bitcoin, and has good food, so I go there often.

Cash will never be obsolete. Checks didn't kill cash, Credit cards didn't kill checks or cash, and Bitcoin won't kill everything else either.
Bitcoin is a supplement. In 30 years, who knows. Maybe checks and cash will be harder to spend, but they won't be gone.

The dude was an A- when I invested. He'd re-paid 90 Btc and never missed a payment. He's a US citizen, was fully verified, etc. His first missed payment was for another loan (not mine) just a few days after I invested. I think my loan only said %12. So no greed, just got on his boat right before he sank it.

So, I took a look here: These regs have my approval. 
The proposal is organized into the following categories, which by definition, **are almost all good things:**
* Safeguarding consumer assets (Number 1 on the list. It reads: Each firm must hold Virtual Currency of the same type and amount as any Virtual Currency owed or obligated to a third party. Companies are also prohibited from selling, transferring, assigning, lending, pledging, or otherwise encumbering assets, including Virtual Currency, it stores on behalf of another person).
* Virtual Curency Reciepts
* Consumer complaint policies (for resolving consumer complaints)
* Consumer disclosures (Don't lie about risks or vulnerabilities)
* Anti-Money Laundering (I.E. report suspected fraud, verify account holders)
* Cyber Security program (I.E. you HAVE to use website security. Not optional.)
* Chief Information Security officer (I.E. you need a guy who's in charge of security. Not optional)
* Independed DFS Examination (I.E. you can't just PROMISE you have sufficient funds, you need to prove it, regularly)
* Books and records (show your work.)
* Reports and Financial disclosures, Audit requirements (again, to protect consumers)
* Capital requirements (they've got some formula to determine how much cash you need to keep on hand. This Is out of my understanding)
* Compliance Officer (Appoint a guy who's job is to be aware of all the rules and regulations, and make sure they're followed. Otherwise, they won't get followed)
* Business continuity and Disaster recovery (I.E. have a plan. Be prepared. Don't get goxxed. And if the power goes out, make sure you've got a backup server elsewhere. Remember when Blockchain was down for a few days?)
* Notifications of emergencies or disruptions (Don't be a dick and not tell anyone if you got hacked.)

This dasfur person claims to have a zero-day exploit (read: A bug that nobody else knows about) for bitcoin. He's demanding 15 bitcoins in exchange for his "only copy" of the bug. If he does not get his 15 bitcoins, he'll publicly release the bug and evil hackers will use it to steal a ton of coins or some other bitcoin network destabilization.  
Or..... he's lying in an attempt to extort 15 bitcoins from chumps. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:21:53

15 btc is about $7,300 bucks right now. (Price is $492 according to preev.com) I feel as though if this were a real exploit, there'd be some more proof and a higher demand. Or I'm wrong. We'll find out in 27 days. Or fewer if this individual is caught.

Here's how it works: Bitcoin owner wants to spend on Amazon. Goes to purse.IO. 
Credit card thief wants bitcoins. Makes a disposable Amazon account and makes a purchase using Purse.io. 
Bitcoin owner gets the goods, Credit card thief gets the coins and moves on to another card and disposable Amazon account. 
As for Circle being vulnerable to the same fraud, I guess you're right. I haven't thought about how Circle could be abused by credit card fraud. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 13:32:46

While Coinbase is also a wallet service (and therefore a competitor), unlike blockchain, coinbase allows you to purchase bitcoin, and it's by far the easiest way to get them I've used so far. Unless blockchain is going to get into the exchange/brokerage business, I think they should list coinbase. (unless..... coinbase has some vulnerabilities and I'm the only one who doesn't know it yet.... gox-doh.....)

I added a credit card to my coinbase account, and can buy btc instantly now. It's definitely just to reduce their risk, because they still debit it from my bank account, not the credit card. (Up to $1,000/day for instant buy) 
It's pretty sweet. They also have an auto-buy feature, where you can make a daily buy for a specific ammount. I buy $1.25 in BTC every day. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 11:59:18
So, KingOfPoon, which merchant software did you use? Blockchain? BitPay? Coinbase?
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:35:49
I use coinbase to buy $1 dollar a day worth of BTC. If I occasionally run into some extra cash, I'll throw that at Bitcoin as well. Then I forget about it. 
If i want to spend Bitcoin, I immediately convert cash to btc using coinbase, so my btc savings isn't affected.

What he's saying is, even though the merchants don't keep the coins, they're still being moved from storage into the exchanges when people buy things. People are now buying with bitcoin and not just holding it. 
which is a good theory. But I want to know how many orders for 309 showed up on BTC-e, and who sold them. That would answer our questions.

It's just hard to promote bitcoin to your friends when the coin you gave them a few weeks back is now almost %50 of what it was

I've been using Coinbase since late 2013. I've been %100 satisfied ever since. It's reliable, the price is pretty damn close to the market price, and they have a feature which lets your auto-buy on a set schedule. (I.E. buy daily, weekly, etc). 
I use it to buy a little bit of BTC every day, and you can buy BTC instantly, up to $1,000 worth, per day. 
Nobody else comes close. Yet.

Actually, it's a good thing because it explicitly forbids all the garbage that go Mt. Gox in trouble.

I disagree. Amazon.com and Credit card companies have been ignoring bitcoin for too long. Using this service actually highlights the problem, turning it into the "Squeaky Wheel".

2. Unlike thos other websites, my name, credit card number, social security number, address, phone number, date of birth, are nowhere near this transaction. So, even in failure, it's a win.

I'm wondering if this is why the price of bitcoin has stayed so high over $1,000? Perhaps it's because the Chinese exchanges were a huge source and now they're sort of like a black hole. Bitcoin goes in, but does not come out.

I use coinbase and Blockchain.info wallets.

I use bitpay.com/visa. 
IT IS AWESOME. 
The way it works: You go to their website and select an amount in USD that you want to deposit. They generate a bitpay invoice and you send them the BTC. 
Most of the time they instantly convert it to USD and boom. You have a credit card with a pre-paid balance of USD. 
I use it a lot for websites that don't yet accept BTC. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:57:02

In case you didn't know, Changetip ( is a site used to tip with bitcoin on social networks. Each social network tipping is a little different, but the gist of it is like what  knight222 did. 
Create a profile on changetip.com, link it to your reddit account, and changetip will give you the coins. You can then move them into your own wallet or keep them in changetip for tipping. 
have 100 bits on me! @_date: 2015-05-28 12:27:31
Some (hopefully) helpful criticism: 
I have an Android phone, and I have extra security turned on my  Circle account. So whenever I'm sending BTC somewhere using the app, it requires me to receive a code via sms. 
I don't like this. There's a setting in the coinbase app which allows me to set a pin instead of require an sms code. I like that very much. The Circle app, as far as I can tell, does not have a way to substitute a pin for the sms code when sending BTC. 
And the worst part.... the SMS code rarely arrives on time, if at all. This is why I don't use circle.

You're not missing anything. It's dead on. 
BTC jam has a ways to go with lender assurances. I just lost 0.3btc on there. Chose a borrower who'd been successfully re-paying lots of his loans, then *poof* right after I dive in and lent, it appears  he finally over-extended himself on and stopped paying his dues. 
Now I know how the bank feels when a loan defaults.

@_date: 2015-01-31 12:16:49
No one really knows exactly. Basically it comes down to supply (which is pretty volatile) and demand, which is also volatile. It could go down to $10 or back up to 400. Pretty quickly. Right now, 3600 new bitcoins are created every day. At $200, that's over $5,000,000 a week being injected into the system. I don't think we'll see any stability until the next halving, in mid 2016.

Nobody should keep large amounts of coin on an exchange for a long period of time. Just as long as is required for transactions to execute. 
But that being said, yeah on the surface this appears better than gox. I don't use bitstamp, (too hard to get money deposited quickly) but it's still crucial part of the btc ecosystem and this latest price drop is likely because of this.
Get dem coins while they're cheap. Thanks, Coinbase.

3,600 btc per day, 25,200 BTC per week, 100,800 btc per month. 
The next halving isn't until summer 2016. Even then it'll only cut the supply down to 50,400 per month. 
Until there's some major advantage to using the coins over other methods, I don't think it'll recover. 
The ~2 million bitcoin users have exhausted what they were willing to exhaust on the initial investment. The growth of new users has slowed.

I think, and someone will surely stop me if I'm wrong, but if you have a "Sell" order set to automatically execute at a certain price, the bitcoin needs to be in the exchange at the time the price is reached.
So, laziness. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:16:08
That's an expensive enterprise. Probably won't happen.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:04:09
I don't think so. In 10 years, miners will still be adding 900 or so bitcoins a day. Granted, the user base might be bigger by then, but I'm not so sure it'll be THAT big that each bitcoin will be worth $100,000. At that price, in 10 years, people would be paying 90 million dollars a day to buy up the new coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:45:42

Unless you pay a high fee (around 30-50 cents) per transaction, they'll take a while. The whole block-size debacle.

@_date: 2017-03-09 14:09:28
From what I understand, the actual block-size limit is still 1mb, they just split the data up into two different pots (transactions, and crypto data) allowing more transactions to fit into that 1mb space. Am I mistaken? 
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:33:18
The whole idea, that we need off chain transactions because we can't deal with a piddly 2mb limit is insane. I get that the block size can't expand indefinitely, but it's criminal that we can't increase it to 10mb before that happens. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:50:28

@_date: 2017-03-20 18:12:08
It's all up to the exchanges. Miners can fork to their hearts content but if nobody's exchanging the coins, it's *poof* gone.

Love your optimism. But with regards with Flex Transactions, Huh?
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:19:13
Why would you sell the coins on the core chain?

The BU people want one thing: fast and cheap transactions, and core is SO CLOSE to making that happen.

Well said. I'd just like to highlight that there are some real risks to using a local wallet instead of an online one such as Coinbase: Your computer/phone/laptop can fail, at which point you'll permanently loose access to your bitcoin. Granted, it's somewhat unlikely and if you've only got a small amount of bitcoin it's not worth worrying too much about. You have to choose for yourself which risks are bigger: Trusting a large company with your bitcoin (which we're kind of used to, I.E. most of us have bank accounts), or Trusting your desktop/Laptop/Phone. (Having a backup drive will mitigate a lot of that). Also, many local wallet apps allow you to write down a list of random words, which can be used to restore access to your coins if your computer/laptop/phone is lost or dies. You can store that in a secure spot, like your sock drawer. :P
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:25:27

@_date: 2017-08-01 17:43:16
I have accounts on Circle, Kraken, Gemini, Gdax, Coinbase (don't confuse coibase's online wallet with Gdax, they are separate services), &amp; Bitstamp. Having used all of them, I can confidently say that I find the Coinbase wallet &amp; it's ability to buy BTC instantly, to be the most user friendly and all-around best BTC wallet service. You won't ruin your accounts on any other exchanges by giving Coinbase a try so you can have an informed opinion. And as far as Coinbase being the 'most active' with regards to closing accounts, there's no evidence beyond some disgruntled users on reddit. In that regard, I'm pretty sure Coinbase unfairly get's a bad rap. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:13:38
Still worth fighting the good fight. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:57:14
A novel idea. However, there's something called a %51 attack, and if all the miners pooled together there'd essentially be ONE mining pool with a vast majority of the hashing power, and able to double spend at will. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:35:20
NO NO NO.... stay put.... I needs to buy more but it'll take me a while.....
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:29:45
54 cents. How'd you do that? 
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:00:11
Yes, the fee is a bit low, when considering the mempool is swamped with a huge backlog of transactions right now. (over 35,000 as I type this. Typical mempoool size is around 1-5k. You'll essentially have to wait until the mempool size comes back down, usually within 24-48 hours. You could try the ViaBTC accelerator, but they've only been responsible for getting about 6.5% of the blocks int he last 24-48 hours.  so you'll likely have to wait a while for that as well. In conclusion: 1. You have not lost your coins. They'll eventually confirm. 2. Just be patient. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:40:42
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:14:41
Sounds shady.....
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:21:06
Current mempool is 35,000 transactions. I'm waiting for the  *miracle* of segwit to get that down and reduce tx fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:41:16
I too, would like to find that guy. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:31:27
Buy opportunity. Sadly I'm without $$ to convert. But that's ok. I'm in the long game. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:22:55
This is a good first step. Hopefully you used a web-wallet and not a local one. If you downloaded a wallet you need to find the computer/laptop/phone that you used and try to fire up the app. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:50:22
Hiding. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:55:14

I'm a hoarder. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:27:08
Coinbase has an agreement with a company called Shiftcard. 
It's directly tied to your Coinbase Wallet and it just works. I'm very happy with it. 
 is a card you can pre-load with dollars by sending bitcoin to it. It's not tied to any particular wallet and you need to proactively fund it before spending. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:38:50
Don't listen to this guy. Tax evasion is a real crime, and you'll go to real jail for not paying. 
You only need to report the income if you convert it to cash. Whatever the "profit" was at the time you convert it, is what you calculate as the capital gains.

@_date: 2017-08-23 15:13:23
He is a real person. And a good guy. (I'm having lunch with him on Friday). Wouldn't post him here if I didn't think he was the kind of leader we need for the future.  He is. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:15:05
My theory is he's hiding. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:35:51
So, they way it works: HE does not personally get the bitcoin. Because of campaign funding laws, his CAMPAIGN gets it. After the election, all cash/bitcoin gets moved over to the local party coffers. It was definitely converted to cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:50:26
I think so. But if that's the case, why have there been so few Segwit transactions so far? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:51:34
Either Segwit is going to bring us back down to sub-$0.25 tx fees..... or BTC is in trouble.

Nope. Just about everybody who's built a company on Bitcoin supports the hard fork. The small-block chains will be tradeable on exchanges, but nobody's going to use them for commerce because the payment processors won't be using it. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:44:32
That guy's article, not so good IMHO. 
I'd buy in if I were you, but don't panic if the price falls shortly after you buy. Buy it, and forget it for a year, maybe two. 
Also, don't liquidate your savings for Bitcoin. Just invest a modest amount.

The NY agreement explicitly says "A 2mb hard fork". I think the small-block supporters are fudging the math a bit? I know that with Segwit, you can "double the tx's in the 1mb block" but that's not the same as a 2mb block... or am I way off?  
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:44:12
How does the size of the block apply to replay protection, especially if Segwit is active? They'll be able to detect what chain they're on pretty easily, based on the block sizes if not just looking at the signaling. and With Segwit2x, there's a 90 day wait after Segwit is active before the blocks increase anyways. I understand slow &amp; safe, but I think the risks are being overblown.

Forgive me. Trying to wrap my head around it. As I understand it: The mathematical problem that must be solved to verify a block, uses a couple of inputs. 1) The difficulty 2)the entire text of the block 3) Some data from the previous block.

Mt. Gox only came to such great heights because it was the first exchange. There are now hundreds of exchanges all over the world, including here in the states. The ones here in the states have all sorts of protections that Mt. Gox never did, such as insurance coverage, competent bank-grade security, and independently verified BTC Reserves. See Coinbase, Circle, iTBit, Lake BTC, Kraken, etc. And you only need to keep your coins there if you want to exchange them for $$. I keep my BTC in a variety of paper, local, and cloud wallets.

If a BTC Merchant offers a discount, he's sacrificing a little of his profit (but usually not all) and still covering costs. 
If a BTC payment processor offers to step in if the merchant declines to do so, then the payment processor is taking a loss, not just cutting profits. 
TLDR: That'll never work. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:26:32
The block reward is pretty big compared to the actual reward right now. 
I.E. for the last block, 350998, the actual reward was only $57 USD worth of btc, compared to $6,375 in BTC. for the Block reward. The "actual" reward simply consists of the voluntary fees that BTC users include. (In the case of block 350998, it was %0.00171 of the 13,375 BTC in the block) They'll always be really low fees. I.E. if the value of btc jumps back up to 1,200 per coin, then people will just include lower amounts of BTC as their transaction fees. Thus, as the block reward starts to go away, large miners will leave the system and it will adjust the difficulty down.

Just fyi.... The checkout worked flawlessly. However.. the invoice in my email does not mention the %5 discount. Might wanna fix that. But a low priority in the grand scheme.

@_date: 2017-05-05 12:43:46
Not everyone with bitcoin has profited. One of the major selling points of bitcoin was that the fees were less than Visa/MC. That's no longer true. We can and should fix it. Period.

Me, I re-acquire all the bitcoin I spend, pretty much at the moment I spend it. Some places, like Overstock, keep a percentage of their coin in crypto. And most of the folks who purchase bitcoin via I would call legitimate bitcoin collectors. (I would not have said that prior to discovering Mechanical Turk and the Amazon Gift Card ecosystem).

Usually an indicator of great btc success. (borat!)
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:59:46
Very true. However, there is a trade off. 
because they're on Coinbase and not in an offline wallet, 
I have easy access to them and they're protected by 2 factor authentication. AND, Coinbase is insured so if they get hacked, my coins will be replaced. And they have a kickass reoccurring transaction feature which allows me to automatically buy a some coin every day. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 14:40:18
Bitcoin was the first, so it's primary value is the price.

Don't think so. Their site has nothing in the support section about BIP148
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:00:50
Bitcoin can only handle 7 transactions per second. Some bitcoin miners have been using this to their advantage to drive up fees. A new release called "BIP 148" which turns on August 1st will accept transactions at ~14 transactions per second. Only those who install BIP 148 will be able to see those transactions however. So the big question is whether everyone will install it or not. Those who are excited about it are calling August 1st "Bitcoin Independence day"

$2,000 by the end of the year is very realistic.

Block size increases are not a long term solution, as the blocks would become too big to manage as bitcoin's ecosystem grows. 
Nobody has a bullet-proof long term solution right now. 
But short term, bumping it up a few megs definitely alleviates lots of strain. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:07:45
Congrats. 
I reccomend you buy a little bit every day or week, and then just forget about it. 
Keep in mind, the price has gone from $1,000 down to $190, and languished around $250 for almost a year, so if it drops significantly, stay the course. All those of us who kept buying at $250 will probably be able to put our kids through college and pay off our mortgages if this trend continues.

So, when folks upload their bitcoins to an exchange for the purpose of selling them for cash - You need regulations to ensure that A.) the exchange is legit and you won't get goxxed B.) The exchange meets security standards so they're not hacked and you don't get goxxed. C.) They have reserve funds in case they get robbed and you don't get goxxed. 
Don't be fooled when you hear the anti-regulatory folks spouting off about how it'll "Affect the use of bitcoins". Some of this stuff focuses on consumer protections and would likely have prevented the whole mt. gox debacle. So, there IS a need.
Nobody's yet proposed regulations like this guy is describing. At least in the 1st 1:06 of his video which is all I could stand to watch.

I never purchase stuff directly off of Amazon anymore. I've been using Purse.io for a couple of years now, and had very few problems. (Once in a while an order is canceled by purse to prevent fraud.

negative. All digital currency held by Coinbase is covered by insurance. Proof: 
 "All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. The policy is provided by a syndicate of insurers through Lloyd’s of London. "

Sorry to hear you're having troubles. I've had to contact circle several times because their fraud detection software kept thinking my $30 deposits were suspicious. They eventually fixed it. 
I never ever buy coins with credit. Only a ach transfers from my checking accounts. 
I also don't like those code based security apps like authy or Google authenticator for the very reason you just described. Unless you print and save the original qr code when you register the app, you're screwed when you need to reinstall it or you lose the device it's installed on. SMS is not device dependent, (I. E. If my phone falls in the water and dies they just port it to a new one) but it is annoyingly expensive. 
Circle may see this, but in case they don't, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Keep emailing them. I expect you'll be squared away soon.

This was a pretty big deal. The Ronald McDonald house in Albany, NY, provides a place to stay for LOTS of upstate NY families who need to come from far away for the children's hospital at Albany Med. It SUCKS when you need to bring your kid out there, but it helps A LOT when you're able to stay somewhere welcoming, safe, and don't have to worry about paying to be nearby your child. 
The Pizza provided to the hospital was received quite gratefully last year, and  it made a lot of kids, and their families, very happy.

My guess is Coinbase is getting slashdotted today. 
If it's a bank transfer, it'll take like 5 or 6 days to show up. The exchange rate is gauranteed at the time you clicked "buy". If it's a debit card, and it's below their "buy instantly" limit, it'll show up shortly.

If the idea is to eventually move all BTC using Lightning channels, why would you ever close a channel? That channel is your connection to the network, and you'd have to go through the process of opening a new channel every time you get back in. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:35:20
So... you're concerned about the data costs of running a node in less-than-wealthy countries, but not the EXTREMELY high (and rising) costs of transactions for users in those countries? People in Kenya can't afford to pay $3/transaction RIGHT NOW. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:23:29
That's worthy of posting a selfie. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:02:45
The number of nodes was always expected to be reduced over time, because of the exponential size of the blockchain. And f Bitcoin ever hits CC level transactions (tens of thousands of transactions per second on Lightning network, all eventually needing to be closed out on the BTC chain) your diddly little ISP won't even be close to being able to handle event he reduced load. This idea of everybody running a full node 5-10 years from now only works if you don't actually use bitcoin as a currency. Which is NOT what it was meant for.

I got emails from coinbase the other day instructing me to abandon Authy entirely in favor of Google Authenticator. 
Coinbase even put up prompts on my dashboard instructing me to switch. 
I suspect Authy and coinbase are having a little friction in their relationship as a result. 
I liked the Authy app. The interface was prettier than Google Authenticator. And from what I understand it's capable of doing TOTP just as well as Google Authenticator.
This could use more clarification.
