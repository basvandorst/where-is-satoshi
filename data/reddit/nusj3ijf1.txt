this is hilarious

but amusingly the "bitcoin source" sentiment about "cc is better for the user" is correct

interesting that you can get people who intentionally/negligently add monetary friction
"that event won't be *nearly* as profitable as they think, because I have the magic touch eheheh (mr burns hands)"  someone could be like that if they wanted to be two faced for an agenda

i meant the ones who would say it seriously
of course there are people who say it sarcastically
then there are those who were mislead and didn't bother to check the source
all of this is trivial so i assumed you knew i knew you knew
stop complicating this

i expect them to look towards the future like anyone/anything looking out for their/its own ass

yeah man fuck all technology, all you get is a shepherd's staff and some primitive farm equipment, and report to your dictator worthless SERF.  take those sandals off because the dirt is higher than you

i would think that the no-chargebacks feature of BTC payments would be an attractive feature for them, and the lack of 3% commissino for the credit card /paypal/whatever companies can't hurt either.

I don't know.
Do you need a license to have a conversation with a friend while letting him/her sip from your "orange juice from concentrate"?
privately participating in cc while using it to privately sell a private food product you privately made requires no governmental oversight

just because there are reasons to do something, doesn't mean that you should do it.  The cons of turning your back on flash far outweigh the trifling performance problems, problems that can and should have been solved, instead of used to support an information bubble and stifle competition.  and why the eff does anything get to burn the battery by using the CPU/GPU, thought these things were supposed to be energy efficient, not energy deficient/inefficient.
i don't know about you but I like my technology to be able to do whatever the fuck i want with technology, and efficiently.  what i don't want is to throw away anything with apple god offending adobe flash because that would be *fucking retarded*
terrorists like to drink water so therefore we should ban water - same fucking retarded "point"
would you buy a car that could not climb hills?  why not?  would you rather just "ban hills" and buy it anyway?!?
the stevejobcunts are cutting their own legs off and enjoying it, jumping around like a fool on one leg going "IM HAPPY IM HAPPY"

its legitimacy is the trust you can place in elliptic curve cryptography, instead of having to trust the bank
its legitimacy is also the fact that it's true money, with real scarcity, like gold
it's about 236857345% more legitimate than the USD
so either you found a way to break ECC or you're betting on a different CC

open to banishment of Adobe flash because it competes with the app store ***maybe***
*open and freeeeeee*
yeah right bitch you suck boooooooo
your anti competitive browser sucks and you should feel bad!

what came first the bank or the government?
and it's hard to tell the two apart sometimes!
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:55:16
incremental conditioning
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:55:50
and since terrorists like to drink water we better ban water
yes it does have everything to do with "superiority"
and it's ***very good publicity to boot***
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:22:57
Rockefellers showed their support for bonds, which made people believe in them.  This is no different.
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:46:54


intrinsic worth?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:02:26
then they would have to comply with some others' laws.  it's turtles all the way down because there are always some hops that are not part of your personal encrypted tunnel
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:32:09
except there will always be someone responsible for doing it.
also it's hypocritical, what are you going to do, force them to continue operation?  
see: lavabit
it's boiled down to an ultimatum.  either die or be controlled

someone else made this:

i think you're describing the physical device itself
normally if hardware were power hungry and slow they would innovate and make it better.  now the tactic is to blame software developers for inefficiency (which may be true, but still the device should be able to operate at maximum capacity for as long as you expect the phone to operate, regardless of the "CPU STATE" or "HOW MUCH CPU" is being used.)
there was a new paradigm shift in computing to sweep performance issues under the rug and it's skewing people's ideas about hardware and software.
it doesn't fucking matter how fuel efficient your car is ***at idle***

blood of our descendants
rational people try to plan ahead for the future.  with the only long term store of wealth being either precious metals or cc, i choose cc.  if you buy a house, even it will deteriorate over the years, and get taxed out of the occupants' hands to boot.
the currency issued by the fed is rapidly inflating and a joke

if only moonshine were illegal then the profit would increase 10 fold and we could do some black bag operations with it

it's not auditing, it's acting out a show to pretend that everything's fine
they already know what an inflationary death-spiral looks like: 
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:13:15
no, you're just wrong and you should feel bad, go back to commenting about WoW and leave money to the people who actually know what money is.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:45:13
it means the government still wants a cut in VAT, and will use semantics to get it
if it can't tax via inflation it will tax via other less effective means
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:37:04


if by stable you mean inflationary then i might agree
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:20:50
give me my walled garden and let me pretend it's more secure because it's a "black box"
compuserve and AOL suck precisely because they limit your experience and give you an "information bubble"


this is laughable at best.  i won't even start to argue about this because i don't have to just google "is open source more secure"  although this was not what i wanted to argue about
if that's a red herring then i get your point that flash is closed, doesn't mean it's ok to outright ban something so prevelant for competing, citing performance issues that are actually the fault of the manufacturer,  and then turn around and fault it because it's closed
which is it, the asshole reason for your stupid arrogance, security or performance
this is what the fuck will come from your stupidity holes next:  terrorism and child porn?
***no walled gardens for me*** tyvm

what came first, the bank or the government?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:55:19
the problem is that the governments and the banks are actually the same entity

isn't that what people said about the internet before the late 90s
i could be mistaken but i think the world economy now depends heavily on the "funbox"
seriously you're like someone who likes logging on to an online multiplayer game every day to tease other players for "being good at the game"

in essence they would be trying to ban writing, recordkeeping, and ultimately, memory
in a way, inflationary currency causes society a form of memory loss
