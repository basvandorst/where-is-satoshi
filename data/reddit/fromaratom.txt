But somebody needs to store them and broadcast them, right?... From what I read so far - LN requires all transactions to be broadcast to all nodes for routing.. So unless they have some way to compress the data 1000 times - LN would require the same amount of bandwidth and storage as any other cryptocurrency..

As far as I understand - channels are exactly 1-to-1. It's actually a on-chain transaction to multi-signature wallet (2-of-2 if I'm not mistaken), where two parties have blocked some amount of money in this BTC on-chain transaction. So if I have locked 1 BTC and the store locked 0 BTC - store can send nothing to me and I can only send up to 1 BTC to store. By "sending" LN transaction - we basically sign a new transaction that either of us can broadcast to BTC chain if either of us wants to try to run with the money. The transaction then settles the money (closes the channel between us) on-chain.
It is possible that my friend, for ex. wants to send money to the store (through me), but then I need to have at least as much as he wants to send to the store in my "channel with store" on my side of channel. So if my friend wants to buy 2 BTC worth and I have only 1 BTC in my channel with store - tough luck, I can't route his transaction (because I don't have 2 BTC locked on BTC blockchain), he needs his "channel" with the store for at least 2 BTC.
Besides from what I understand about how LN works - in order to find a pay "route" between me and the store - basically all LN nodes need to know about all LN transactions that are happening on LN network (to be able to find - is there an open channel somewhere with enough money to "route" my transaction).. And if everybody in LN needs to know about all LN transactions - I fail to see how is this any better in terms of bandwidth than BTC.


I don't think that's how it works. If I locked only 1 BTC in my mutisig wallet with store - I can't send 10 BTC (the multisig wallet has only 1 BTC locked.. and if I run away and store broadcasts the transcation - they will only get 1 BTC..).

What? Does LN compress the data 1000 times somehow?
Other than that - [1TB blocks are possible now](

It is explained on the page: "This server has a mempool limit of 500 MB. The mempool is currently full and low fee transactions are evicted."
Basically there is not enough space to remember all transacation, so as soon as transaction with bigger fee comes - the one with low fees is evicted from memory (the nodes with more memory will still remember that transaction still and might mine it).

Ok, so then it's expected that 1 channel would always handle minimum of 1000 off-chain transactions? (The original comment says: "If LN needs 133mb blocks, Bcash will need 133tb blocks or more.")... How does that work? Let's say that the channel is between me and a friend - do we send each other money back and forth 1000 times before closing channel?   Because if 1 channel would be used less than 1000 times - I still don't understand the phrase "If LN needs 133mb blocks, Bcash will need 133tb blocks or more."

Yes, but assuming that LN needs to know about all LN transactions (otherwise LN hubs won't be able to route payments - they don't know which channels in LN have enough money to route the payment -- that's the current plan for LN routing) - doesn't that mean that we basically more the bandwidth requirement from BTC to LN. And now LN needs to support "66.5TB" blocks worth of bandwidth? Why is it that LN can handle "66.5TB" blocks worth of bandwidth and BTC can't?

Thanks for the explanation!
