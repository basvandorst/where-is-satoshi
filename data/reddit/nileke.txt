The argument from the researchers are true based on the Blockchain consensus mechanism in which Bitcoin (and other energy conauming Cryptocurrwncy) is/are running, that is Proof of Work (POW).
But because technology is advancing, we see new emerging solutions to the existing problems.
The newly established Proof of Transaction (POT)- is an experimental consensus algorithm, in which TAU (The Active Unit) Coin's Ecosystem running, proposes fair, fast and secure network ever.
Here is why Taucoin has come to solve the problems caused by Bitcoin.
a. Low fee transaction
b. TAU is green, no need for that massive hashpower to secure the network.
c. TAU has the new approach POT or Proof-of-Transaction
The number of transaction secure the network. So the community itself help to secure the network by making transaction.
Unlike Bitcoin and ethereum, the only people that secure the network are the miners only.
