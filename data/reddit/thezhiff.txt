A Satoshi Nakamoto puppet is esential.

Thank you about that. BitPay is also my choice. I wanted coinbase at first tempted by their "first 1m$ is free of tax" but they require a bank account in USD which doesn't work for me.

Obviously, no matter what you suggest there will be a ton of people to disagree. If you wait for everyone here to come to an agreement it will take forever and you will end up doing nothing. Just go ahead and make that tournament. We have to start from somewhere and that will be a good start.

Well, I might have over dramatized that part a little. :)
For me the lowest it gets for a transfer to a USA bank is 45 euro. That is with 2 days delay. But I can rarely afford a 2 days dellay given that most bookings are only confirmed after they get the money from me. I can't risk selling something and just hope that 2 days later it will still be available.
Looking at a worse case scenario it might get to up to 120 euro. 
It depends on the speed needed and on the other bank as well. In example, I recently had a couple willing to go on a ground tour around USA. I contacted an online agency to provide the local tours and guides. They agreed to give me a 3% commission which is relatively good commission on a total of about 500USD. If I was to pay with a credit card, they wanted 2,5% on top of the price. An express transfer was 100 euro.
Have you made transfers as a company or as a citizen? The taxes are different.

My decision might be wrong. I am expecting that someone will now say "hey, I tried selling flight tickets for bitcoins and it cost me a fortune, don't do it, because..." That's why I post this on reddit. :)
At least in a month or so I might be able to say that to someone else. :)
I get the fares from Amadeus. They are the same as any other offline agency would give. Nothing special, mega-discounted, ultra-last-minute, etc.  :)

Don't know about the idea and if people would be willing to donate, but I honestly think you website is great. Intresting content, easy to browse and read. You just got one more reader.

I bet he won't be getting his salary in bitcoins.

holidaydelux.com is my site. I didn't bother to mention it since it is only in Bulgarian.

This comes to show how insignificant the news is. It's been going on for 5 years and still the vast majority of people never cared enough to notice.

My thought exactly.
