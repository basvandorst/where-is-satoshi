Its an asset and a liability. The cash, check or whatever deposited becomes an asset of the bank and a corresponding liability (unsecured debt) is immediately created in favor of the depositor. I’m right. Source: I’m a lawyer. And I specialize in bankruptcy. I know what the fuck I’m talking about.

I know for a fact I saw him say back in 2014 that he was being paid his salary in bitcoin. You’re telling me he didn’t save ANY bitcoin during that time?!?  I don’t believe it.
I first bought some in late 2013. At one point, I had over 30 bitcoin. I have never been paid in anything but USD.   I got out of bitcoin in late 2015 as I needed to sell what I had to fund a run for office I undertook. I only got back in, in a small way, at the beginning of this year. If I hadn’t run for office, even I would have had &gt; 25 BTC anyway coming into this year.

I meant bcash yeah. I prefer litecoin and Dash as transactional currencies. But I wish the core devs had simply agreed to increase the block size. That would have worked for some time. Lightning is not a solution. Off chain means it’s not trustless.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:26:55
That’s a misunderstanding. Basically if you have no other taxable income at all, and your capital gains add up to less than whatever the 0% rate is, you pay 0%. You still have to report it. Most people have some income though. If you were unemployed, or retired and living off of Social Security, you could take a certain amount of capital gains each year without paying taxes on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:45:07
Oh, so you’re assuming that every Lightning transaction is going to be between parties that operate a channel?!?!?  I sincerely doubt it. For it to work, the vast majority of transactions will be on “lightning hubs” where the parties to the actual transactions are just using other peoples’ channels for a fee. In that scenario, the parties to those transactions must trust the hub operators to honestly settle all off chain transactions. This is only slightly different than a bank in that you have to trust two parties instead of just one. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:08:10
In this hypothetical scenario that I am in no way suggesting is true, a person sending themselves a “gift” of bitcoin, purporting to be from a third person, wouldn’t pay any gift tax because they would be claiming to be the recipient rather than the donor. The unknown third party donor would theoretically owe the tax, but a person running such a sham “gift” to themselves could simply deny having been the donor and avoid paying any tax at all, gift, capital gains or income tax.

Thanks. My position exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:02:05
You missed the point entirely. The tax is due on gifts over a certain amount (I checked and it’s $14 K right now) but THE TAX IS OWED BY THE PERSON MAKING THE GIFT. NOT THE PERSON RECEIVING THE GIFT. Therefore, if someone were to fake a gift to themselves, in a very public way, using, let’s say anonymous internet money, Then that person could claim to have received a multimillion dollar gift, which they, as the recipient of the gift, WOULD NOT OWE TAX ON. It would be up to the IRS to find out who made the gift and tax them. Good luck with that. Now such a person would be committing tax fraud, but what I’m saying is, they could get away with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:51:55

The cap is to how much a grantor can give without it being taxable to the grantor. Around $11K per year last I checked. The recipient never owes tax on the gift. In the United States anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:15:16
Yep. The idea is that a person receiving a gift shouldn’t owe tax because of something they had no control over (receiving a gift) but the person making the gift needs to not have a way to avoid estate taxes by say, giving their fortune to their heirs before death.

Lightning is centralization relying on trusted intermediaries. Not what bitcoin is about. I wish the core developers had simply agreed to raise the block size.

I’m averse to loss myself. And I’ve cashed out more than double the amounts I’ve ever invested. This way, when family members say “it looks like a bubble. What if it goes to zero?”  I can respond “I’ve more than 2xed in a few years by cashing out some, so I’m playing with house money at this point, so if it goes to zero, I’ve still made the best investment decision of my life.”  And that shuts everyone up.

Think about what you just said. If there’s an intermediary at all, that requires trust. Now, if a lightning channel between two points is only handling transactions between those two parties then sure, the chances of collusion between those parties is next to zero. One of them isn’t going to act against his own interests. But if you have a “lightning hub” that’s mainly handling transactions for others, those others have to trust that those two parties will accurately settle up on chain when the channel is closed. They probably will, but who knows for sure. Bitcoin wasn’t about trusting “lightning hubs” and it wasn’t about off chain transactions. I don’t know what the hell the core devs are thinking.

Thiel has a point. And it's not even about whether a taxing authority ever sets up a bit pay account or not. You can certainly sell bitcoins to pay taxes, so that's not the problem either. What he's pointing out is that since the government must be paid in the currency of the realm, there will always be an organic demand for that currency. A demand which cannot be met with Bitcoin. Whether you sell for USD to pay taxes or pay through some third party which will sell and then pay the USD on your behalf, this creates a demand for dollars which will never go away.

FDIC isn't covering the deposits of the banks that fail now anyway.  They are closing the banks on Friday, selling them to a solvent bank, which then picks up the deposits as liabilities, and the bank reopens on Monday under the name of the purchasing bank.  Depending on the situation, the transaction usually involves the FDIC paying the purchasing bank, with banks bidding against each other to be the bidder with the lowest demand.

No. I think you're thinking of people who are out on parole. I.e. They've been released from prison early prior to completion of a sentence for a crime they've actually been convicted of. It's not uncommon for such restrictions to be placed on them because they're still considered in the custody of the state and have previously been found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury of their peers. You can't compare parole conditions to bail conditions for someone who hasn't yet had a chance to defend himself and hasn't been found guilty of shit.

Hi everyone.  I am the Vice-President/President-Elect of the Cabot Rotary Club.  I am also the immediate past treasurer and at a recent Board meeting we approved of the Club accepting bitcoin donations.  We began a trial run on accepting bitcoin back in September when I began paying my "Happy Dollars" in bitcoin, but have approved it to "go live".
We are a 501(c)(3) tax exempt charitable organization, and anyone contributing can obtain a tax receipt by contacting me.
If you are hodling some BTC with a low basis and need a tax deduction, this may be a smart and charitable way to obtain that, as you can help out without incurring any capital gain.
Our Club has primarily been involved in helping out locally in the Cabot and Lonoke County area, by directly funding or contributing time and other resources to a local food bank, First Care, the Open Arms Shelter, a shelter for children who have been removed from their homes by law enforcement for abuse and neglect or because their parents went to jail, Lonoke County Safe Haven, a shelter and resource for victims of domestic abuse, among others.  We have also sponsored foreign exchange students, both inbound and outbound, for several years and Rotary members have handled the logistics of that process and also acted as host families for the inbound students.  We assisted victims of the tornados in the Vilonia, Arkansas area earlier this year.  We have also sponsored a scholarship for two graduating seniors at Cabot High School each year for several years now, through the Cabot Scholarship Foundation.  Our Board has also just approved a new program to assist monetarily with the counseling staff at the two Junior High Schools to help cover various needs that needy students at those schools may have throughout the school year.

At my law office, the receptionist has a printout of our public address QR Code.  If a client wants to pay in bitcoin (no takers yet), she is instructed to let them use their phone to scan the QR Code and make the payment.  Of course, in that instance it is up to the customer to pay the right amount of BTC, but most mobile wallets that I know of have a way to either pay an amount in USD or at least show the USD amount of the bitcoin you're paying.  In either event, blockchain.info will show the tx and the amount in USD "at the time of transaction" so I can always look at that and if it's at all close to what the client was supposed to pay, I'll live with it.

No, it's definitely a client software issue. Having a client that displays a QR code for a SEND address is absolutely pointless and downright idiotic. Under what scenario do you need the QR code to appear on the send tab of a client? It can only display the QR code once you've entered the public address. And once you've entered the public address into the client you can send. You don't need a QR code. It would only make sense if you wanted to use multi bit as a QR generator to use with a mobile device. That's not going to happen. The only feasible use case for a QR code to appear on multibit would be to display the QR code for an address held within the multibit client.

Transactions are up to about 3800 an hour.  If the 150,000 kWh figure is correct, that's about 39.5 kWh per tx.  In my area, it's $0.11 / kWh, so that would be $4.35 per transaction.  I guarantee that much of the network is powered by renewable, essentially free resources, such as solar, wind, etc.  It would be the way to go for any decent sized operation.  So, I think the current tx cost is actually lower.  For the foreseeable future this cost is subsidized by the block reward, but yeah, the theory is that by the time miner fees are needed to incentivize mining, the transactions will be there.

Hmmm no. That's the socialist fantasy of Robin Hood. The original Robin Hood stole money from tax collectors who were collecting for the King's brother while the King was being held hostage by the Moors. Instead of paying the ransom to free the King, his brother was just living it up and being irresponsible. Robin Hood took the money and paid the King's ransom so he could be freed and return to England.

Seller: but the shit has hit the fan, I don't know if I should still only accept 25,000 bits. I'd feel better at 40,000 bits. 
Buyer: that doesn't really make any sense, because only the dollar has changed. The fundamental value of Bitcoin has not changed. The fundamental value of your pizza likewise has not changed, but I really like your pizza so I'll pay 30,000 bits.

What it means is, someone who has held bitcoins for a large number of days without being moved, is transmitting (likely selling) a large number of BTC. If I hold one bitcoin for one day and then send it to a new address, that's one bitcoin-day destroyed. If I hold 1000 bitcoins for 1000 days and then send them, that's 1 million bitcoin-days destroyed.

not necessarily.  An equitable remedy available for breach of contract is "specific performance."  You can request that the counterparty be ordered to perform the specific act they contracted to.  If I agree to provide you with a gold coin in return for you sending x amount of btc to my public address, and I provide the coin but you refuse to send the btc, I can sue you and request the Court order you to send the btc.  Sometimes, the Court might decline to order specific performance and instead award money damages (which in the US, is always USD), but there has to be a good reason for that.

Any tweets where they falsely reassure the public can potentially become the basis for fraud charges.

Yeah, but it's a qualitative difference with bitcoin.  In your cc/debit tx, you're giving the merchant the ability to "pull" money from your account.  If the merchant is untrustworthy, or the minimum wage employee goes rogue and decides to raid your card or sell your info to a Russian hacker or something, then you're SOL.  With bitcoin, you are "pushing" the payment, and no one can modify it or take more money then you sent, etc.  This is why I have become very mindful of where I use my debit card, and generally try to pay in cash or Gyft cards wherever I go (not been to an actual brick and mortar that takes BTC yet).

If Bank of America halted withdrawals for a month, would anyone have any doubt they were insolvent?  Why are there even still Gox fanboys arguing against all evidence?  They are clearly never going to pay their customers.  Gox is either insolvent or the senior management has possession of the BTC/fiat and intends to run off with it when they determine it's time.

From a merchant perspective though, it's a six month confirmation time.  Merchants can drive adoption through discounting.  I already use BTC through Gyft to pay for everything I order from Amazon, due to the 3% discount.  And I also have found that I'm ordering more of my online ordered stuff through Amazon now because of it.  Things that I used to price shop more or try to find on Ebay for a steal, I'm now just saying "fuck it, let's just buy it on Amazon."

I'm a member of a local civic organization whose membership is about 25-30% bankers.  Every so often a member is called on to give a presentation to the group on some issue or topic of interest.  I recently gave a "Bitcoin 101" talk to our club, and many of the bankers were visibly disturbed.  Some made negative comments that clearly came from a place of fear.  A couple of them had thoughtful questions, but they were all frightened by the implications of what I had to say.

It definitely negates something. From a consumer standpoint, one of the selling points for Bitcoin is that it's a "push" payment rather than "pull" payment. It sounds like this Shift card is simply using Bitcoin as a source of payment for a debit card and you're still giving out info to merchants and potential hackers who can then raid your Bitcoin balance on this shift card. Plus you're relying on third parties like MC/Visa and this Shift outfit and I just don't see the point. At least with Gyft cards you aren't giving out any info to anyone.

If it truly crashed "overnight" I would think vendors would just charge whatever they would have charged in BTC pre crash. By referring to what their good or service "ought to cost" in pre crash USD compared to the pre crash BTC/USD price. I.e. If a pizza ought to be about $10 USD and BTC ought to be about $400 then a pizza ought to be about 25,000 bits and vendors would just price in BTC and not worry about USD.

Not terrible, just not profitable.  And I have no idea if that's the average bitcoin ATM tx size.  Also, from what I've heard, these bitcoin ATMs are getting little to no usage where they can be found anyway.  The ROI time is ridiculously long if at all.

My understanding is that Bitpay's default user model is for Bitpay to convert all BTC to cash to pay the merchant.  Though they also offer plans where X% is kept in BTC and paid to the merchant as BTC.  I would think that MSFT would have included the fact they would retain a percentage in BTC in their release if that were the case though.  Overstock does this.  10% IIRC.

Would "users" include anyone who's ever paid a merchant that uses Coinbase?  Like if I use the Breadwallet app on my iPhone to pay Dell for a computer and Dell processes it through Coinbase, does that make me a user? (In addition to the fact I am also a user by virtue of my account at Coinbase)?

I figure they basically considered the BTC theirs all along and by refusing USD withdrawals basically forced everyone to buy the BTC held there for a high premium, from them. Then when the had sold all of the BTC they hadn't already stolen, for inflated USD prices, decided to blow it out. They have all the fiat and BTC and no clients will ever see either from them again.

To be clear, you can sue for money damages, but in the US, it's only USD. In certain instances you sue for the remedy of "specific performance" which might include returning a confiscated physical item or performing on a contract but you can't insist on collecting say, a jut verdict in Bitcoin. Now that's not to say a defendant and plaintiff couldn't settle a suit in Bitcoin, but you couldn't force it on a judgment debtor.

Well they haven't actually had to "cover losses" yet have they?  
I mean, I know they declared they'd stand behind all deposits, and they projected confidence and they got back online relatively quickly, but unless they've experienced a 100% run on the bank, they haven't actually had to cover any losses. If it's true that the lost Bitcoin is like 14% of deposits, then so long as any bank run is less than 86% of deposits, they aren't having to cover anything. Given how well they've handled it I would be surprised if even half their deposits are at risk of a run. Even if they didn't have the capital to cover in that scenario (but I suspect they do) they could run as a fractional reserve until profits gradually covered it.

Yeah, for most "regular people" it would require a Western Union-type company setting up retail storefronts with employees, etc and doing the transfers with bitcoin but in a way that is transparent to the customers, i.e., it would be Western Union with cheaper fees.  That will be the case so long as people want to send dollars from the US and have them show up as rupees in India or pesos in Mexico, etc.
A bitcoin company might try to compete with WU by offering lower fees, but I have a feeling they would need to be well capitalized as WU could probably win a price war if they were so inclined.  The reason they get away with their highway robbery as it is, is simply a lack of competition.

For me the pros of privacy and being your own bank are HUGE.  I utterly hate banks, and I don't like being at the mercy of their systems.  As an example, the other night I tried to pay at the pump at a gas station and it denied my DEBIT card.  There was 5 figures in the account at the time, so it wasn't a balance problem.  I thought maybe my bank shut it down due to an identity theft similar to what I had suffered a couple of years ago where hackers in europe had tried to run about $1,500 through my debit card in one day, but my bank caught it because of the unusual nature of the charges.  Well, I had to go ahead and pay in cash inside (luckily, my distrust of banks causes me to carry cash every day).  I checked the next day and there was no problem with my account, the money was all there and no suspicious charges had come through.  The banks records didn't even register an attempt at a charge by me at the gas station, so maybe the bank's servers were offline the moment I tried to make the charge, or maybe there was a communication problem at the pump, who knows?  All I know is that this banking shit is unreliable.  If I could be free of banks I would be, but in my business, my vendors don't take bitcoin, and I need a debit card for various purposes.  I have no credit cards, and owe no one any money at all.
If I could use bitcoin everywhere, I would have no bank account at all.
As to the negatives you cite, I've never tried to chargeback a payment I made with a card.  I don't think that's an issue I'd be concerned with.  If you don't trust a merchant you propose to deal with on the internet, don't deal with them.  I for one, trust Amazon, and the few other places I buy things from.  But, I won't just log on to any old website and give them my debit card info.  And at this point, I'm paying for my Amazon purchases with bitcoin through Gyft, which has caused me to make more and more of my purchases through Amazon which I might have done with Paypal on Ebay.  
I would say that people using pull technologies like credit and debit cards are FAR more vulnerable to scams and ID theft.  With bitcoin, how are you vulnerable to scams?  The only info you ever give anyone is your public address, which cannot be used to take anything from you.
As far as tx time, I think that's a red herring.  I used to be concerned about it too, but my breadwallet and multibit wallet immediately register a transaction once it hits the network.  If I look at it and see that it includes a miner fee, and it's propagated to the network, then I know for a fact it's going to confirm, so I don't worry about it.
Buying bitcoin first is no longer an issue.
So, OP, what else ya got?

Store of value plus high value transfer of value is absolutely a great case for bitcoin. I also see a long term, reliably sound store of value use Case such as if someone is going away to prison for a number of years, they can put as much of their wealth into an HD wallet, memorize their 12 words and then when they get out, they still have their money. The government can’t confiscate it, their friends/relatives/associates cant steal it and it’s a hell of a lot easier than trying to dig up buried treasure.

It's my understanding that Bitcoin POS systems exist that when the customer goes to pay, presents a custom QR code, not just for the receiving address but that also specifies the amount transacted plus a miner fee. In that way, the seller could mandate a "very high priority" fee for each transaction. It's my belief that this would prevent double spends. The merchant would then only have to wait the one to three seconds for the transaction to propagate to the network and be virtually 100% assured of eventual confirmation.

Yes, they pay by having the bank actually own their money while they are merely an unsecured creditor of the bank for $50M. 
The only people who actually own $50M (other than banks) are people who have it in cash in their physical possession (I.e. Walter White's storage unit), or Bitcoin. Bitcoin is easier to carry/move/hide etc. just imagine if Walter White had converted his drug money to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-19 18:36:08
I think the OP's point is that people view a bank account as an asset that they own. When the U.S. Supreme Court has held that a depositor is merely an unsecured creditor of the bank they have deposited the money in. The actual deposit is an asset of the bank, not of you, the account "owner."  When you make a deposit, you are loaning money to the bank, today almost always at zero interest. A checking account is referred to as a "demand deposit" because the bank has agreed to ~~allow you to withdraw~~ pay you back "on demand."

I'm not going to help data miners by identifying myself with a transaction but I will say that I sent it about 90 minutes ago and it had a fee on it sufficient to be considered "Very High Priority" according to blockchain.info.

Upvoted because you were getting downvoted, and while I don't like the idea you might be right, I have to concede you may well be.
The best point you make, in my opinion, is about trust.  Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless.  In theory, if you're paying someone directly in bitcoin for a product or service delivered in person, contemporaneously, there should be no need for either party to have to trust the other, or anyone else for that matter.  Whereas paying with a credit card, for instance, requires that the seller trust the buyer not to do a chargeback, and also trust the bank to pay the money to the seller's bank, and trust the seller's bank to release the cash to the seller on demand.  Likewise, the buyer has to trust that the seller won't "pull" more than the agreed upon price  or use the card info to run through additional charges later, or lose the card info to a hacker, etc.  In this scenario, bitcoin is clearly superior, and this would be obvious to anyone who thinks clearly about it (though the vast majority of the public do no such thing, of course).
The above bitcoin transaction, however, is not entirely trustless, unless each party is using a device they manufactured themselves, running software they compiled themselves, from code written themselves or open source they personally read and verified to be safe.
That's not particularly realistic though.  People aren't going to go to that trouble, now or ever.  99% would be incapable of that.  If you're suggesting that 100% trustless transactions are required for bitcoin to take hold as a dominant payment method/currency, I have to disagree.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but it also can't just be a little better than the legacy financial system.  People have to have a reason to change something as fundamental as their financial habits.  I believe they do, but most have neither the time nor the inclination to look at it.  I'm convinced that anyone who studies bitcoin for a week will come the conclusion I have, which is that it is orders of magnitude superior to the legacy financial system.
But people are creatures of habit.  People do things because "it's what you do."  I'm 39 years old.  When I was a little kid, I saved change in a jar, because that was what you did.  When I was 8 or 9, I used the change I had saved to open a passbook savings account at the local bank, because, that was what you did.  Other kids were doing it.  I did it.  It was a rite of passage.  When I was 16, I opened a checking account.  Why?  Because everyone needs a checking account, of course, and I had to learn how to use one, obviously.
There's a lot of momentum behind this financial system of ours, and it is ingrained in our culture.  That's powerful, and difficult to displace, even with something that is demonstrably FAR superior.
Even though you're correct, that we have to trust our device manufacturer and mobile wallet developer aren't going to rob us, the more time that passes in which they don't rob us, will increase the amount of trust we can safely give them.  I keep most of my bitcoins on breadwallet on my iphone.  I trust that Apple hasn't installed some malicious code into iOS to rob me.  I trust that hasn't put some code in the app to rob me.  I trust that if I lose my phone, I have memorized the twelve words I need to recover the HD wallet.  And as a business owner who accepts payments from people every day, I trust Apple and Aaron a hell of a lot more than I trust a random client not make a chargeback within 6 months, or that I trust paypal not to decide for some unknown reason to freeze my funds, or a bank not to give my money to the government because they've decided I deposited too much cash in a given period of time, etc.
Bitcoin doesn't have to be 100% trustless, just more trustworthy than what he have going now.

"Only if they too are sold."
No, that makes no sense.  If Satoshi's BCC is sold, it means Satoshi (or someone) has the keys to those original block rewards, and has elected to sell the BCC, but not (yet, anyway) the BTC.  It means that the someone selling the BCC, has access to and can sell the BTC, which means the available possible future supply of BTC is higher that is believed by the many who believe Satoshi's original block rewards are lost forever.  This means the money supply is larger than many currently believe.

But they COULD if it were possible, and the entire backlog could be cleared in one block.  As it stands now, it cannot be cleared.  This is a real traffic jam folks.  When I first noticed this earlier, the last 6 blocks had taken over 2 hours and there were over 8000 unconfirmed.  Then we had three blocks inside of ten minutes, and it didn't really put much of a dent in it.

For arguments sake, lets assume he ran the site the whole time, and there were no other Dread Pirate Roberts.  Is he responsible for what third parties do on his site?  If so, you need to call the FBI and tell them about a dangerous criminal called the CEO of Ebay who is running a website where people have defrauded people selling fake shit for years.  Racketeering it is.  The guy's a fraud kingpin.

What's crystal clear is that whoever ran this site went by "Dread Pirate Roberts."  Did you even see Princess Bride?  Dread Pirate Roberts wasn't just one guy.  DPR would pass his identity down to the next guy and retire every few years.  It's entirely possible that Ulbricht developed the site and then when it became a hub of illegal activity, passed it down to someone else, maybe someone with a history of buying bitcoin space websites in the early years, like oh, I don't know, Mark Karpeles.  The point is, even with the evidence there is, there is reasonable doubt that Ulbricht had anything to do with the illegal stuff and furthermore, even with what he is accused of doing, they overcharged him.  You cannot POSSIBLY believe it would be justice for Ulbricht to get 30 or 40 years in prison, do you?  Because if so, that's fucked up.

She'll need to pay legal fees, etc.  Plus she is unbanked due to her identity verification issues.  Let's prove bitcoin can be a solution for those incapable of obtaining bank accounts!

I'm not banking on anything. I don't personally believe those coins are lost anyway. But I do recognize that many believe them to be lost and that such widely held belief has, in some respects, supported the price. And if any of those coins were to be spent, either as BTC or BCC, then all would know those coins were in play, and so to whatever extent the belief that the coins are lost has bolstered the price, confirmation that they are NOT lost might suppress the price.

The OPs point is that if you try to use Coinbase to *send* money to someone by their email address, then Coinbase will simply send them an email allowing them to claim their coins by signing up. However, if you just enter the Bitcoin public address, Coinbase sends it over the network. It's really a stupid criticism. I mean, if you want to send someone Bitcoin and you only enter their email address, how in the hell do you expect Coinbase to transmit it?  Just guess at a public address?  Enter your recipients public address and this isn't a problem.

Yeah that doesn't always work. Google Keith Moser Madagascar. This guy was a lawyer here in Arkansas. He ran off to Madagascar with about $500K in client funds (including about $15K belonging to clients of mine) because they don't extradite. But do you know what they do have in Madagascar?  Law enforcement that doesn't mind helping the U.S. when asked, and extremely shitty jails. 
Apparently the guy was being watched by FBI pretty soon after arriving and after he overstayed his visa, they tipped off the local cops, who threw him in a very shitty and unfriendly jail where he was the only white guy. In swoops the FBI who explained they could get him out of there but he'd have to waive extradition. Yeah, he was in a federal prison very shortly after that.

I'm not in Africa. I'm in America. And if it costs me $1.50 to send $1000, then that's about $28 cheaper than using PayPal. And no chargeback risk. Do I want to buy coffee with bitcoin at these fees?  No. But buying coffee isn't a logistical problem that needed solved. Sending non-trivial amounts of money without a bank standing in the middle is the value proposition I see. And in almost every transaction it's cheaper than using banks or PayPal.

Juries are notoriously stupid.  I mean, they couldn't even get out of jury duty.  I care not what the jurors here believed.  Even if the guy was the only DPR for the entire time the site existed, the prison time he's looking at is not "justice."  However, I have doubts that he was the "kingpin" or "mastermind" or whatever.  Between him and Karpeles, I choose to believe him.
