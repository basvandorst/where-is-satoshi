I am going to print this off to remind me what the future looks like

Do you mind sharing it with me also?

Grandma bought into Bitcoin, time to sell yet?
@_date: 2019-03-08 01:13:19
You can't be serious...you seriously think USA will have the best economy in 40 years?!
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:06:29
Can't go mainstream until all three tiles for BTC are listed on the cover page.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:38:44
Would be cool if this was accurate
@_date: 2019-06-08 04:37:45
Commenting to watch later

I was thrilled to have passed 10k last night. Welcome to the fucking show ladies and gentlemen!
@_date: 2019-02-13 15:16:07
Great technical analysis! Thx
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:54:52
This is so accurate,  I want to cry...
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:52:11
I am with you man, buckle the fuck up Rocket, we're going to the moon!
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:09:34

Beginning of 2018 was by far the worst when it came to checking prices. I am down to about twice a day now, okay maybe 3x ��
@_date: 2019-06-12 01:28:28
Jamie Dimon is a ��

Any of the countries within the Mediterranean Seven agreement would be crypto friendly.

Commenting to listen to this later.

Dead serious,  I mean take this with a grain of salt but I clarified and asked if it will be some sort of a fund. He said, no sir, we'll purchase any coin you like.
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:36:08
I sold some HAL stock on Thursday and asked the rep when Fidelity is planning on offering crypto. He said they are 1-2 months away.
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:04:26
No, it was early February and I should probably mention I've been their customer for 15 years.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:00:29
I am using CIBC, they tried blocking my first transaction but then ended up giving me a $50 credit after I complained about a missed opportunity.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:02:18
I will also charge you negative interest rates for keeping your money in my bank.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:24:25
I am with you. Just not sure if I should break up my purchases or throw a sum at it right now. I've learned a couple of lessons in 2018. Feels like the bottom is in, of course, until I buy in and crash the market...
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:46:26
You need to physically sign the transaction, don't you?
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:25:51
Newbies haven't experienced the pain we've endured for the last two years though. All those entering the space are lambos on a moon right now. Only put in what you can afford to lose, take it from me, my journey started at ATH.
@_date: 2019-05-05 21:23:48
Best type of advice man. Appreciate it, already have couple of people DM'ing. I am also thinking of riding it out next couple of weeks.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:05:34
I might have to split my second pair up to cover both of you.
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:39:52
There is a lot more of these guys, standing on the ledge, thinking if they can only roll back time. Kind of like CZ trying to roll back blocks after the binance hack.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:00:21
This guy is a legend!
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:27:30
I am definitely in for a long haul and not looking for day trading. Thanks for the link, I'll ask the question there and see what the community has to say.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:24:20
I hope you're not keeping your BTC on an exchange...
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:54:33
I'll send you a pair when we're @ 50k
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:20:01
I am of a similar sentiment. I've enjoyed learning about history of money in general. Seems that the problems were always the same, until Satoshi. There is no doubt in my mind that the only solution to existing state of affairs is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:48:07
Centralization of power my friend. Rulers ability to control supply of medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:50:48
End of 2020

!remind me December 31 2021
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:54:44
Fuck the feds! Their days are numbered, we'll beat them at their own game. Bitcoin is sound money, USD isn't and they fucking know it.
@_date: 2019-05-03 15:56:47
Not sure if I am following what you're saying but seeing your account is 4 days old I wouldn't exactly say I am new...
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:18:05
I am with you on this one, I also find that I sleep better this way.
@_date: 2019-05-03 18:02:46
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:05:24
That's probably what I am going to end up doing. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:40:23
Exactly the kind of information I am looking for...thanks
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:04:10
Might take a bit to explain so I would recommend that you start reading the book man. Ammous uses a lot of examples throughout history of systems that continously failed us.
@_date: 2019-05-03 21:39:41
Great find! Thanks for sharing this.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:37:36
Checked them out, it's a tiny community that I would rather stay away from.
@_date: 2019-05-05 21:36:11
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:00:40
I'll take my chances with BTC mate. Enough of this, things have to change, future looks bright.
