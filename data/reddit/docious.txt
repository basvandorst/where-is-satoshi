With a government as corrupt as China's it is a valid assumption that any given internet-based currency will have a greater chance of succeeding if individual politicians are personally vested in it. And because bitcoin was not embraced in such a way my question has to do with the "what if they did" ... would bitcoin have more success there? A similar currency based in china with just such a user base might be able to take a solid hold there...

Right not talking replacing a currency but if they start a new coin or back a small one that's just starting and the politicians get in on the ground floor they might be more willing to encourage it's growth. Thoughts?

The Yuan is a traditional state-based currency. We are talking about internet-based "bitcoin like" currencies. I'm not saying the government will officially recognize anything, nor should they want to... more like if there were to be a currency similar to bitcoin that had grass roots in China and politicians got in on the ground floor. It might "organically" have more momentum in China then bitcoin would... which in turn could open the currency up to a larger user base.

Oic, thanks for that. That makes a lot more sense now.
