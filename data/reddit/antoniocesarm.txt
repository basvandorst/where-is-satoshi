I'm PMing you the website but keep some stuff in mind:
* I've never tried it yet so I can't guarantee it is gonna work (although they seem pretty trustable from the reviews I've seen on their Facebook)
* everything is in Portuguese and there is no English option
* I believe Neteller doesn't allow accounts from places *that are not Brazil* to add funds via boleto
...so it might be complicated to use that from America. Also I do not, in any way, endorse their services so it's ultimately your risk. Last but not least could I know how you plan to use it? I don't know of any service that allows you to send funds to the US via boleto and I don't want you to lose money.

I should probably be trying the website later this week. I could give you guys some insight (if you want).

Claro, sem problema!


Ahhhh faz sentido :o)
Eu vou tentar fazer a mesma coisa na verdade, vou comprar algo barato e ver se funciona. Me avisa se der certo :)

I just found out one of our biggest gas station brands (Petrobras IIRC) now takes boleto for prepaid gas credits. And assuming you can buy credit card funds with BTC and buy food with that... then yes, you can.

Guys, you're being tagged here because you expressed interest in my thread before and I want you to stay updated :p

I've never found such a website *but* I know you can buy a prepaid credit card at an Americanas (sort of a "Brazilian Target") - which you can load with Boleto - and then buy Butcoin using it via PayPal. It's not *direct*, but that's as close to it as it gets AFAIK. 
Paying with Boleto is usually cheaper than paying with credit cards actually. I've seen some stores charge fees though, but the highest I ever saw was around 3 reais. Less than a dollar.

Ok guys so you wanted me to try this and tell you if it actually works. I already said I can help, so I'm leaving this message here just so you now what I'm gonna do now.
* first of all, I'm going to buy Bitcoin on an American exchange using PayPal funds
* then, I'll have a boleto for around 30 reais created on Neteller so I can load my account with funds
* I'll pay said boleto using the service I told you about and wait until my funds show up on Neteller
* last but not least, I'll obviously buy stuff using my virtual card and see if it works.
I plan on spending my funds on Origin (14.97 reais on SimCity) and on the Nintendo eShop (5~10 reais on some random 3DS game). I might try paying for Spotify with it too but I don't know yet.
Once all of that is done, I'll submit a new post to this sub providing feedback! Also I'll tag there anyone who wants me to do so (just ask).
Wish me luck! :o)

Lol your comment (and your profile too for a matter of fact) is almost cartoony. Calm down man.
Btw the way you type reminds me loosely of Portuguese sentence structure. English isn't your native language, right?
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:04:57
Oopsie. What do you think I should do then?
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:22:32
[I don't see anything on the blockchain indeed.]( What happened to your balance?
Keep in mind that is just a wild guess. I'm rather new too.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:47:26
What is that?
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:03:41
Sorry for hijacking your comment but are you trying to say someone is probably trying to slow down the bitcoin network on purpose? My transaction has been stuck (0 confirmations) for over an hour even though I've selected a 67 spb fee. What should I do?
@_date: 2016-11-23 16:48:24
Does that somehow have to do with the fact [my latest transaction]( doesn't have a single confirmation even though I've sent it more than an hour ago and I'm paying 67 satoshi per byte?
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:53:56
I use Mycelium so I picked the "Normal" rate again and, this time, it was around 90~95 sat/byte. 3 confirmations in 10 minutes. Not bad.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:19:23
Ok, I'll do that then :) thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-24 00:31:18
I'll look into that, thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:19:34
Hopefully hahaha.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:46:18
I can't, at least not for what I'm doing atm. But I just raised the fees by 10 cents and it was back to normal.
@_date: 2016-11-23 17:41:33
Lol true. I know bitcoin isn't exactly instant and I'm used to waiting up to ~1 hour for the 6 confirmations to actually complete however this is a bit longer than what I'm used to waiting.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:59:31
I paid 24 for my last transaction (5 bucks) lol. But yeah. Bitcoin might be a great tool but it's not for everyone yet (imo). Imagine all the middle-aged moms panicking over their money that "won't be sent, no matter what I do!" lol
