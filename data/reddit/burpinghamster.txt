I understood absolutely nothing of what you said..

In your opinion, what would happen to prices if by some magical advancement, quantum computing came online and the remainder of the 21mil coins were mined almost immediately? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:23:02
I just checked out the sub the other day.. man they are a lot of angry people over there..
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:37:41
$5000 a coin by monday
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:24:28
I need it because bittrex is showing a pretty nice price for what I have.. keep wishing I could access it to sell.. but it keeps going up up up.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:59:06
don't blame you, I wouldn't be caught dead driving a fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:37:52
fok! will they pay the cost I had to spend to send everything over to bittrex and then back again? they planned this the whole time! geez
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:01:43
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:43:29
it hit $3240 at one point.
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:20:21
hooray! sold my bcc on bittrex before it fell too far. free money hooray!
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:34:53

@_date: 2017-08-02 22:33:52
FT.com is annoying. Has that "you read an article this month already now subscribe" thing.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:02:06
Everytime I bought an alt coin- except for LTC or ETH I got burned.. Voxels was the worst.. wtf was I thinking?
I made up for all my mistakes though.

You gotta eat a 80's tube sock with yellow stripes, not one of those low cut ankle ones..
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:19:26
the moral of the story is don't sell your bitcoin. Period.
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:02:03
i bought in at $750 around last December thinking I missed the wave.. how wrong I was..
Now selling those 75 ETH I bought for $4 a piece and sold for $7.. that's a different story.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:52:35
I started with bittrex, it was the easiest at the time.. bcc is currently being worked on so I can't access that wallet. I would really wait as the price is going unrealistically high ATM. Once it is unlocked they could become worthless rather quickly.

Haha, was at Volcano Bay water park this weekend and my wife said we couldnt afford to get anymore cocktails. I blurted out, "but we just made $6000 this hour in bitcoin!" some guy in front of us turned and smiled, and I said, "he knows what i'm talking about.." he said no shit.. we high fived.
New money friend.
Sad thing is we don't want to cash any of it in because 4 mixed drinks for $50 bitcoin at an amusement park might be an extra vacation home twenty years from now.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:08:39
yeah and at 252525 we will be enslaved by giraffes.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:59:13
and an equal amount of people somewhere are going to be buying a lot of chicken dinners to make up for it.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:40:15
yeah who empties a windows recycle bin?
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:33:22
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:08:05
people said that at $500, $1000, $1500, $2000, $2500, $3000.. which was what.. a week ago? I missed the $5000 I said it would hit on monday. But I bet i'm not too far off.. I say $5K in 3 weeks now.
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:32:10
What is real money? We are not on the gold standard anymore.. and what is gold? Should we go back to trading seashells or wampum? What happens with all the bitcoin when you die? What happens with cash or gold when you die? Who cares, you are dead.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:04:13
well didn't hit 5k.. oh well. at least it didn't go down.
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:11:24
USAA accepted coinbase into its online banking system.. that was good enough for me.

Lmao those arrows blend in perfectly, like they really follow him around everywhere he goes.
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:02:53
It will be fine..
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:01:07
Lmao it’s hilarious. Both sides are like, exactly the same and don’t notice it.

Proper support.. Malta is tiny.

Why do people watch these?
Why do they give them money?
Why do they always have shit flying all over the screen?
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:36:30
Wow.. how patriotic of you. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:45:35

What a dick. I thought they were hacked? I remember him bowing on Japanese tv and apologizing. Better watch his back if Kim Jong Un really is using BTC to fund his nukes and shit. Might get VX in the face.

The fall was necessary and healthy.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:39:48
Bring it on! And buy as many as you can now.. this will make the price skyrocket.

It's the Rothschilds! And the Masons! And the Shriners in their tiny cars wearing silly hats drinking together in bars without their nagging wives!
