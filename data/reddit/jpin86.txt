I was obviously generalizing, not referring to everyone. Sometimes I hope it all tanks even though I’d lose a lot of money. I just think it would be better for society if crypto whales lost their fortunes.

Your interpretation of history/evolution is sexist

Well yeah it is only the men in blockchain who are assholes, in my experience. There is a problem with pervasive misogyny in this space. That’s why there have historically not been many women. It is a hostile community for women. Women historically have been excluded because crypto men are sexist.

I’m not a noncoiner. If I were, I would not be as exposed to the rudeness, hostility, and misogyny within the crypto community.

Making a joke of sexual assault is not acceptable

I’m not an “infant.” Your responses to me are only confirming that what I say is true.

Being productive doesn’t solve this problem. The fact that you are responding in this way just shows what a problem there is.

Continue talking about it. There’s nothing else I can do.

He’s a scammer? How do you know that? ��
Does that mean he doesn’t know what he was talking about? Should I delete the convo I had with him? 
Why are so many big people in crypto following him?

Lol I have no anti-man agenda. This is the only post where I’m even talking about men, aside from where male OB/GYNs were telling me that female sexual response isn’t as interesting and defending the omission of clitoral anatomy from OB/GYN literature.  I’m also anti-men who think that male sexual response has more relevance to OB/GYN than clitoral anatomy.

I’m not a nocoiner. Not even close. It just sucks to have my investments render me part of a community of assholes.

Well, I’m getting more and more views so what I’m doing is working. I don’t care if people think I’m obsessive.
