I watched the full length version of that video (I was never into Bitconnect, obvious unsustainble model to me, but am finding the fallout fascinating!).
This part made me laugh, sure. But his longer point is that you haven't lost your money until you sell. He believes BCC coins will eventually have another use case and will go up in value. When the price was at its lowest, he even "bought the dip".
He may have a point. We have no idea what the company, or the community will decide to use the currency for in the future. 
Personally I think BCC specifically is unlikely to recover, but in crypto the whole "you haven't lost til you sell" is worth remembering.

Personally I prefer the Ledger Nano S but both are excellent and support a similar amount of cryptos nowadays. The Ledger is slightly cheaper. Advantage of Trezor is it supports Android as well as pc, linux, mac etc. Eitber will do you very well, just get whichever is in stock and affordable at the time of ordering. I'd avoid buying from 3rd parties like ebay as there are a few scams doing the rounds if you aren't careful.

To be honest I don't remember much about how I did it, I just googled it and followed instructions. At the time Yobit was the only exchange allowing recieving and selling for BTC. I'm sure there are more optipns nowadays, so Google is your friend.
Most important advice, as always with forks, would be to first move any BTC into another wallet, so that if anything goes wrong or you accidentally fall for a phishing scam you don't lose all your coins.

Yeah, you can't profitably mine BTC with a GPU anymore, you need an ASIC like Antminer S9. With  a 1080 you could mine Ethereum, Zcash, Monero etc though, although your hashrate won't be particularly high, could take a year or more to get the costs back, unless whichever alt you are mining skyrockets.

@_date: 2018-01-16 06:08:59
Yes that's accurate for an S9. Actually a good investment at the moment, assuming you have low electricity costs, can put up with the noise &amp; heat, and believe that BTC will either hold or increase in value over next year.
[edit] PS I agree with your comment that Kodak listing 375 every month is disingenuous, because mining becomes more difficult each month. However this is assuming that tge price stays locked. If it increases in value enough it can mitigate these issues.
Right now, its difficult to predict if BTC will rise or fall in price. ETH mining woukd probably be a safer bet - plus you can always resell the OC and graphics cards, whereas dedicated Asics have less resale value once superceded.

Register with an exchange that accepts fiat, like Coinbase or Gemini and get your bank account and credit/debit card linked. Buy a Ledger Nano S or Trezor hardware wallet. 
Any time you have spare cash, use the exchange to buy BTC, then imediately send it to your hardware wallet for safety. 
Note that at the moment transaction fees can be a lot higher than than they used to be, so its better to save up and buy in larger amounts (EG I used to just buy with a tenner or whatever change I had left at the end of each day, now I never buy less than a few hundred per transaction)
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:12:07
I've nothing against Bcash existing per se. I just object to Ver's holding of bitcoin.com and its related app to ransom purposely trying to mislead newcomers - and it resulting in people losing their money and feelin ripped off. That is bad for adoption of all cryptos in general. Bad word of mouth spreads quickly.

BTC is only really viable to mine with ASICS nowadays. with a 1070 you could mine Ether, ZCash or Monero far more profitably. I'd personally go for Ether with Claymores software, using Nanopool, and sending to MyEtherWallet. Remember to use MSI afterburner to tweak the best performance from your card.

This is a valid concern, and why I personally see Bitcoin as potentially massively going up to maybe a million a coin, but eventually crashing to zero. Don't see that happening for 5 years or so though, and I imagine the developers will find a way to fix this - maybe a proof of stake rather than proof of work system or some other way to reward people owning nodes? Either that or the 1000 or so people who own a huge amount and therefore have it in their own interest not to crash will run servers. Does seem that long term Ethereum has a better future, especially if it does become internet 3.0 or a valid decentralised app and games platform etc. but short term, BTC has more price growth potential.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:54:51
I have in the past been massively in debt, living in a caravan with no electricity, feeding cold tinned beans to my pregnant wife. 6 months before then I had a steady income and was running my own business. Long story short, dotcom crash combined with a few frivolous lawsuits from clients.
We'd survived a few months without claiming state benefits but realising I was undernourishing my unborn child, something in me snapped and I swallowed my pride and asked for help. We recieved around £60 a week for 2 years.
My son is now going to university and I'm proud to say we have worked our way up to being far better off than we ever were, even before crypto started doing so well. I have a big house, AMG C63, Diamond and gold presidential Rolex, 82" TV. I am literally this afternoon travelling to Florida for Christmas and New Year. More importantly I have no debt whatsoever, enough to cover my bills for years, and money invested for our retirement, for our kids, grand kids, and hopefully even beyond that. This was a VERY slow process. In those 17 years I have worked at McDonalds, Tesco, bar work, security, cleaned public toilets and more whilst trying to get business back up in between shifts and investing what little I could as wisely as I knew how.
And you know what? I've never forgotten how much the state benefit and occasional help from charities (providing white goods, occasional Christmas presents for kids for example) kept us alive whilst I was trying to find a job that could pay the bills and feed my family.
Ever since I started earning money again I've always chosen to give at least 10% of all my income to charities and good causes. 10% of minimum wage. 10% of millions. No failure, no question, no regrets. I also pay my full whack of tax, no avoidance, offsetting or "creative" accounting. Often 40% of what I bring in! I feel privalidged to be able to pay back into the system that helped me get back on my feet, and give others the same opportunities. 
I do believe in a meritocracy to some extent, but there has to be a basic level of income and support that we afford to each other as a basic human right in a progressive society. The arguement that hard times will spur you to raise yourself out of them relies on that even being possible, and without basic food, shelter and medical care its a severely unfair disadvantage.
Disclaimer: I inheritantly distrust politicians and the banks and coorporations that fund them. I'm not the biggest fan of our school systems, police forces or organised religions either. But a basic welfare and social care support system is a very good thing, as long as beaurocrasy (sp? sorry) is not used to trap people in the system.
This may not change your mind, and I'd be surprised if you bothered to read my sleep deprived rant this far, but if just one person on welfare sees it and it helps them feel better about their own circumstances and inspires them to keep grinding towards a better future I'll have not wasted the few minutes it took to type on the shitty touch screen on my phone ;)

Absolutely nothing, other than BTC has the first mover advantage and brand recognition, both of which count for a lot in the short to medium term. Plenty of newer coins have more interesting tech to be honest, but it remains to be seen if any will over take it.

Stay away from Ripple if you are looking to long term hold. Bitcoin is a much safer bet. Also Ethereum is a very good partner investment. Both are speculative of course but are the two best chances we have of long term "moon money" and are far less risky than the others.

In the case of Cryptos, reported Market Cap is simply the current price of the coin multiplied by the circulating supply. Think of it as the amount of money you would have if you owned every coin in circulation (ie currently mined, not locked up).
(this is very similar to the stock market, although I believe with stock the market cap is based on the price multiplied by how many shares are available to buy.)
The price of coins is based on supply and demand - if more people want to buy than sell, the price goes up, and therefore the market cap value increases. If more people want to sell than buy, the price goes down, and market cap decreases. 
BTC has a very limited supply (currently around 16 million coins, and never more than 21 million). This means than only 21 million people can own 1 Bitcoin each - but of course many people/miners/companies own several coins, and some own hundreds or even thousands. If this averages out as 7 bitcoins each, then only 3 million people in the world can own bitcoin at any one time. If someone else wants one, they will have to buy them from one of those current owners, increasing the price.

Oh wow that's cool! Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:58:39
Yes, very likely. The fact there is a hard cap of 21 million maximum means that there will be less coins available to buy than people who want to buy them - the exact opposite if the "tulip" effect - more akin to gold or diamonds,  but even more rare. 
If people want to buy them, but no new ones exist, they have to buy them from someone who already has them - therefore the price will go up, increasing the market cap. This is why Mcafee is arguing for $1 million value per coin by 2020. 
Of course, it might not rise as high or as quickly as he is projecting, and there may be plenty of crashes along the way - even extremely severe ones, maybe even to zero - but long term I can't really see any way they won't increase in value given time, patience, and balls of steel.
PS I am not a fiduciary or financial advisor. I could be very wrong. But I doubt it. For balance, I also really like ETH, Dash and Monero for different reasons, but none have the rarity of BTC.

Not even the most searched news story... the most *trending* news story, which is quantified by having a big spike in interest compared to 2016 - so things which are always being searched are discounted. 
For example, if Bitcoin is equally or slightly more popular next year, it won't make the 2018 list at all, because it would have to have an abnormally large spike on popularity compared to this year, rather than equal or steady growth.
Its impressive still, for sure. But a loooong way from being the  searched term, as many are mistakenly reading. It probably isn't in the top 500. We still have a long way to go before properly breaking the manstream.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:51:21
Heavily researched this a year or so go. Nkt all companies are scams per se but ALL are just bad investments either way. No current cloud mining service will turn you a profit before the contract expires (even the "lifetime" contracts are actually only whilst in profit, so will cancel within a year!). Not Genesis. Not Hashflare. None. You'll get something back, but significantly less than you spent. You could have just spend the money buying your crypto of choice and watching it grow in value way quicker than potential returns on cloud mining.

XRP may get some sweet gains in the short term (especially if they do get added to Coinbase) but its also highly, highly likely to be mass dumped and cashed to zero at any minute, and every price increase makes this more likely. Waaaay more risky than any other coin in the top 10 imo. The banks are working together to manipulate the market and control 90% of the supply, and its in their best interest to make out like bandits and have a major bloodbath reducing public trust in cryptis at the same time. Looks like a ticking time bomb from every angle I can see. I may bexwrong, I may get flamed and do your own research etc but if I was you I'd plan an exit strategy pretty quick...

Whilst I agree in theory, many people see these cars as unachievable dreams whereas a generic "lambo" or similar is actually more affordable than most realise, because they dont spend just a few minutes to research the reality of it, prefering to keep it as an unreachable dream.
You can buy a Gallardo or Model S second hand for £40,000 easilly. Just look on autotrader. Add a custom plate for £600 and 90% of people wont know the difference and will think you are rich. Most people in the street are just impressed by the Lambo badge and shape, and don't know a Gallardo from an Aventador. Just look at Tai "Here in my Garage" Lopez from YouTube a year or two ago who got crazy rich selling money advice courses, simply by flaunting a £40,000 car to "prove" he was a multi millionnaire - thousands of people were impressed and bought his courses and have actually made him a multi millionnaire nowadays. "Fake it til you make it", eh Tai?
I just bought a tricked out MG C63 S, a £77,000 car, but bought it few years old from a private seller for £20,000. Added tinted windows, custom wrap and custom plate and everyone looks at it like I'm a billionnaire, not realising its probably not worth much more than their Ford Escort cost. Hell, you can buy a second hand Porsche Boxter for £4,000 and most people will still think you are rich...
Failing that, you can rent expensive cars waaay cheaper than buying them, and therefore get a new one every 6-12 months. Thats what a lot of rappers and athletes
do. I used to rent a Gallardo (probably the cheapest Lambo) for £2k a month a few years back, same exact one now would be more like £500 and most people would still be impressed, and they are very fun to drive.
Of course either way its a money sink with insurance, fuel/electric costs, but if you have a fancy enough car you can actually charge people to use it in low budget films and music videos and turn a profit. I know a few people who do this. Just takes some creative thinking is all.
TL:DR Actually, if you own even 1 BTC or a handful of ETH you could drive a car that will make you look and feel like a millionnaire. It shouldn't be your number 1 priority (first should be to HODL some) but its nice to treat yourself and show that you are doing ok!

Good taste. I just bought the AMG C63 S. Not brand new though, that would depreciate too fast. Amazing car, will do til I get my Tesla Roadster ;)

Trying to offload BTG perhaps? Thats how I ended up registering with them yesterday as after Googling, several sites suggested selling them there, though annoyingly it seems that deposits are temporarily suspended... there is a semi cool feature where you can click to get free tokens there though, even got a few thousand of some of them. Yes they are all currently worthless but one of them may mon at some point and if so it should be easy to convert to BTC :)

Is this because your passport or ID is not from the UK? I have a Hungarian friend and a Greek friend both living and working in the UK and they experienced a similar sounding problem, and were told this is a known error if your country of ID and IP do not match. They just had to contact support and they authorised their account manually. Both of them have now resolved the issue but it did take a few days inbetween each support email and getting an answer...

Yup, I've seen people sell Gallardos for 40k in the UK before. They were the cheapest and most widely manufactured Lambo, so will continue to be cheaper as they get older. 
Still crazy cool though. I used to drive one. People think you're a multimillionaire when your car is actually worth barely more than the finance on their Ford Focus :p

Fucking brilliant

Oh sure, yeah. The fuel price was stupidly high as well. That and only 2 seats and no boot meant it was impractical in the long run. Now I drive an AMG C63, 5 door. Almost as fast, waay cheaper to run.
