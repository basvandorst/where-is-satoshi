It's alwasy a question - are you a trader or investor? If you hodl, just makes sure you hodl more and more bitcoin and don't care about the amount in USD. If you are trading then it's more complicated and there are so many stratagies. Even if you really believe that fiat will be worthless and wanna hodl only bitcoin, I would suggest to diversify your risks. Good luck!

First of all make sure it's not your last money and you gonna be fine without them. Secondly ask yourself a question - is it long or short term investment? For the long one it's a good time. As other people said here read some info about wallet, exchanges and safety. Good luck!

Just be careful from 8300 to 9100, don't invest too much or don't invest at all at this moment, cause there are so many people who gonna try to play short right now. There is a big chance to go and test 9050-9100 and then go back to 8000 again. Still need more positive news.
