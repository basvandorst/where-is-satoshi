Thank you, I do understand that, I guess my question was about the constant rise in the size in the “other chain’s” per transaction size. If there was something weird going on. This post might get deleted, but it was genuinely driven by curiosity if there is some inefficiency in the other coin.

It’s odd. Days distorted isn’t going up. They might be up to something. I’ll take my tinfoil hat out of the desk drawer now.

Although I would like to agree, I think that regulation is going to play a big part of this.  Not for bitcoin itself, but for the companies using bitcoin.  Right now you have to convert and you might not want to in the future.  But the service processing your payments will still be charging you. And they will have regulations to follow  from the same article, you can see that about .73% is to fraud and regulatory, and they will still need a profit margin, and operating costs.  So technically if we think that the same amount of regulation will apply(and I think a bit more due to the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin) so 1% actually seems rather low.

I read this document earlier this week. And they had commentary around the table saying that the costs would probably grow with regulation narrowing the gap. I love Bitcoin and bitcoin but we need to be objective. And aside from the one tech writer from cnet or zdnet ( on mobile and don't remember who it was) it was a good set of analysis and interviews. Good questions. Reasonable concerns. All in all very reasonable analysis.

Ok let’s forget bch. Say You just won a pot in a game of poker. You can take all the bills on the table. But you only take bills above a $5. The amount of work didn’t change. Just the reward you chose to take is less. 
Since everyone works from the highest to the lowest fees. It’s not like there are better fees. Just what’s left.

So to summarize. Taxation is theft but forced childbirth is ok. Got it.

You are correct. Thank you sir.

Yes I would. They are doing all the work. And not collecting all the fees. So just leaving money on the table. Considering some of these pools are ok mining bch at 1spb fees. I feel like there must be an ulterior motive.

the inherent cognitive dissonance in free will for all things other than the one I disagree with is odd though.  Much like as I imagine we would all agree, I hate Richard Spencer and I hope he is found dead from an explosive rectal syphilis outbreak(sorry) I would never ever say he shouldn't speak his mind just because he is wrong and terrible.  
EDIT:BTW that is why I am not a libertarian.  I think that we as members of a society have a responsibility to take care of our fellow man, and unfortunately, that takes taxation.
EDIT2:way off topic for this sub :) I think we can all agree that the more use Bitcoin gets the better it is.

are there any fees below 5 sat in those blocks? 
@_date: 2013-03-26 20:14:07
i understand that there are fees, and and the carry risk but i guess i would really just need to find a bank account where as a US citizen i can store EUR.  and have both my USD account and said EUR account in my mtgox account and go from there.  
My ignorance is showing here but how can a US citizens have EUR accounts? whats the process? do i just go to HSBC or some other multinational bank?

They didn't honor 2 of my transactions and ignored emails in between. I lost out on over $100 worth of gain in bitcoin price and they sent me $10 worth of bc. I understand the trials of a service like this, but I had a verified bank account that succeeded in 2 prior transactions so why now? Their algorithm is flawed and clearly doesn't take prior successful purchases into account.   Worst part is that they didn't tell me about the cancelation until the 4 day waiting period was up, as I watched the value go up to be deflated later.  They have since whitelisted my account and we'll see if my $34 btc goes through now that it jumped to $40.

my own lack of proper English grammar aside your your use of omg and omfg in the same submission clearly means you are person of higher intelligence.  My point was the explicit use of this for the purpose of converting currency.

Thank you for the response. That's exactly what I was hoping for. I guess maybe its a touch early in the btc lifecycle for things like this to he easy.
