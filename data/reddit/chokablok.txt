No they were not overnight loans. The 'broad-based emergency programs' were a mix of short and long term loans. 
'Pages 133 &amp; 137 - Some of these "broad-based emergency program" loans were long-term, and some were short-term. But the "term-adjusted borrowing" was equivalent to a total of $1,139,000,000,000 more than one year.'
Also the Fed bailouts were 26 trillion, not 16.
'Page 205 - Separate and apart from these "broad-based emergency program" loans were another $10,057,000,000,000 in "currency swaps."'
Page numbers are from the audit.

We are in the worst depression since the 1930s. Probably this depression is even worse. Does that count as a problem?

Keynesianism is a long winded and wrong justification for big government. They are more interested in politics than economics. 
Unfortunately they project their politics over economics onto everyone else. This is why no matter how many times they are shown to be wrong and no matter how often you explain to them why they are wrong they ignore you, wrongly assuming you are making a clever political argument.
Basically Keynesians are morons.

The Fed has created a decade long depression with their meddling. That guy has not. Therefore he is smarter than the collective intelligence of the Fed.

More people are using bitcoins by the day. And more businesses accept bitcoins as payment. This means there is more demand for the currency which will push up the price. This really should be slow and steady, but seems to come in mad rushes.
The price should really take off in 2016, or maybe 2017, when the supply of bitcoins drops. If you can buy just one and hold for that long you will make a few bucks.

Bailouts and lobbying are exactly the opposite of what Rand wanted. A bail out requires the state to take someone's money away from them and give it to someone else for some ideological do-gooder reason. Sounds more like socialism, doesn't it?

So, banks create piles of credit and lend it against houses. The price of houses shoot up. All investment is pushed into housing. There is a giant bubble. 
Then the banks run out of money. They cannot lend any more. Less is lent and the price of houses falls. There is a correction.
Was the problem caused by evil deflation shrinking the money supply or over-lending creating a bubble? You tell me.

I moved some bitcoins from an old client to a blockchain.info by improting the private keys. There's a console command to get the private keys, can't remember what it is. It was pretty easy. Be careful not to give anyone the private keys though.

'The purpose of this police is to prevent money laundering and capital flowing out the boarder'
To prevent money laundering is the usual excuse used by tyrannical states to take control of your money away from you. Remember that money is your labor. By taking control of your labor they turn you into a slave.

I guess you find the belief people should be able to improve their lives through hard work to be selfish. On the other hand the state taking people's stuff by force being selfless.

It's an unpopular opinion, but I see Bitcoin ending up being a unit of account mostly held in cold storage by banks and central banks and maybe the IMF. People will end up using bitcoin credits at a bank, like they have dollar credits instead of money today. Accountants might not be so affected. 
Kind of defeats the purpose of the Bitcoin, I know, but when they become widely and internationally accepted I bet that is what happens. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:44:29
Should be a good buying opportunity. If you want to get bitcoins cheap that will be the time to do it.

It was obvious that $1000 was going to be a resistance point. It was the target a lot of people wanted to sell at. A hundred bucks was the same. The price will bounce about here for a while.
The good thing about this is the stable price allows slow organic growth, instead of a frothy exponential price explosion. It's better if the Bitcoin just grows naturally than these crazy parabolic swings.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:58:29
Economics became a means to justify political views. People who actually study economics get sidelined in favor of screw ball 'theories' like Keynes'. Faced with a crisis a government does not want to be told they need a correction. They love being told to spend piles of money.That's why we have been in a depression for a decade. People only hear what they want to hear.
When people have take on pile of debt the economy seems to boom. Hence 'inflation is good!'. When the country gets saturated with debt and it comes time to pay it back there is a slump. Hence we get 'deflation is bad!'

In economics saving and spending are the exact same thing. Instead of consuming all resources some are 'saved', which allows them to be used productively.

Bitcoin is what people would freely choose to use as money for several reasons. Not least of which is that it takes away the ability of the state to steal by money printing. Clearly corrupt regimes hell bent on theft, like USA and China, hate this horrible power being taken from them. 
Bitcoin is a monetary peasant's revolt. People rising up to take control of their money back and remove it from the thieves and bullys who call themselves 'government'. The reaction of the Chinese state is pretty much what you expect.

Sorry to have to break it to you. Your economics 'knowledge' is outdated claptrap. You and your like are the reason the small recession we should have had in 2001 was turned into a calamity in 2008, then stretched out into a disaster lasting the best part of a decade.
What you believe is economics is really political dogma.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:07:00
In a sensible economy saving and consuming are balanced by market set interest rates. People will manage their spending and investments all by themselves, without an ivory tower numbnut deciding how much they need to save and spend for them.
The deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a decrease in velocity. It is not caused by a shrinking money supply. It is caused by more goods and services competing for the same amount of money. The increasing value of bitcoin is driving people to offer more goods and services. You can see for yourself how great deflation is for an economy just by looking at bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:57:37
 Credit bubbles are not good. Deflation is not bad. Keynes is outdated claptrap.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:35:49
He is correct. The field of economics is dominated by Keynesian gibberish. It has been shown to be wrong over and over. Unfortunately it justifies a large state and state control of people's lives, so is heavily promoted and funded.
This is why we are in a great depression, by the way. The Statists blamed the 2008 downturn on 'capitalism', instead of interest rates being forced down in 2001 to prevent a necessary correction. They then argued that the state wasting everyone's money on rubbish and bailing out banks would make us all rich.
Real economists tell people what they don't want to hear. Stuff like 'Borrowing money does not make you rich.' So they get ignored.

If I had 84 million dollars of bitcoins just by being an early adopter I would not describe the situation as 'SOL'.
As more stuff comes available for bitcoins he can buy what he likes. That's how money works. You buy stuff with it. If he had 84 million dollars in federal reserve notes would you worry that he needs to change them all for Euros or he might lose it all?

Four million dollars is more than 2000 bucks per week for your entire forty year working life. I don't think many Americans make 100k per year for their whole life.
150k is still fifty bucks a week forever if you just spend the capital.

The Fed print about ten times Bitcoin's market entire market cap each and every single month. If Bitcoin was even as big as the Fed's rampant money printing per month you could add a zero onto the price.

What he said. The great thing about bitcoin is not the price increases. It is the prospect of taking control of our money back from the banking cabal. To be able to earn money and save it without your work being stolen away will be revolutionary.

If this is the crash and btc stabilizes for six months it really hasn't been a bad run at all. Bitcoin is really starting to snowball now. More people using it attracts more retailers, which makes more people find it useful. The price will go back up, just more slowly.
