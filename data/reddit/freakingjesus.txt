I never said that. I'm saying the record industry gave up because it's so prevalent they can't stop it. P2P beat the US justice system. The world changed, music is now free.


That's not what I'm arguing here. My point is that governments rise and fall because of technology. Technology is the backbone. I stand by my point, technology is a much more powerful force than wealth or politics.

Absolutely. Imagine the price when these problems are solved though? Basically if coinbase had insurance and the government totally okayed things?

Not at all, but it is unusual for an investment to grow exponentially. Any other time in history sustained exponential growth has been a scam. Some people stop there understanding bitcoin but if you read a bit deeper in this.. It isn't going away.. and it's going to continue to get bigger

I agree, if bitcoin hypothetically got big enough it would start to devalue fiat. At that point it makes more sense to talk about the value in terms of what it can buy, rather than what it's worth to other fluctuating currencies

Right and that $40 goes to the mining industry which has a direct financial incentive to create more powerful and efficient computer technology. That's a very good thing for society. As opposed to a system where central banks can create money out of thin air to fund wars nobody wants. Instead that $40 is distributed across the network and feels like the inflation that's built into our current monetary system. The consequences of inflation in a bitcoin economy are much better than with fiat.

There was so much negative news 4 months ago from the media, calling it tulips, a Ponzi scheme, a speculative bubble* (this one was true in the short term).
Now the media has evolved into saying it's "in" right now, starting to report on all the venture capital and noticing that silicone valley is excited. The financial news is very interested recently too.
The fact is that it's here to stay. Just like BitTorrent or the internet itself. Everyone expected this to be a blip of a story but it's been in the news consistently for 4 months now. That's not going to change and journalists and readers will inevitably have that "oh shit" moment when they realize this is powerfully good for humanity. The learning curve is pretty steep but the rewards are potentially massive. Especially to the early adopters ;D
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:42:13

Right but if banks are failing and the notes are being auctioned off below market value isn't that going to affect general home prices? The mortgages would stay the same with the new owner of the note (either another shitty bank or the government), but the housing market would collapse significantly if banks fail and their assets (notes) are auctioned off below what their value was before the collapse.
I guess what I'm getting at is that I think home prices are still in a massive bubble because they're deflationary assets and we don't have many deflationary options. I think home prices will collapse and stay low if we move to crypto. $500,000 for a house makes no fucking sense.

Absolutely I am.

I forgot about the .01 minimum, transactions fees and whatnot. Maybe it would batch process donations, once the account reached a threshold it would payout .01 to all addresses as regularly as necessary... or it could pay out once a day or something.

My point is that this is the first time where you can call it a new paradigm and you're right. It is unprecedented, and it is justifiable that the price is rising exponentially
@_date: 2014-06-21 13:35:15
If it's going to happen it's going happen within 10 years. Maybe less than 5. I think when we see a mass migration over to another system it's going to destabilize the current one. Bank runs and banks failing are pretty much the end of fiat. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:16:50
That's sort of the point though, it doesn't matter how many addresses you're donating to if it's cryptocurrency (as you know) you can just keep dividing it. If I donate 1 BTC to the cause, those 1 million adresses get .000001BTC, if 1,000 people donate 1BTC those 1 million adresses get .001BTC. For doing nothing. Just for holding an account and because it is possible to do.
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:13:27
Bitcoin absolutely has to be getting their attention. They have to keep removing these gift card sites because they assume when people buy gift cards they are going to actually gift them and can expect a certain percentage will be forgotten about / lost / never spent. Bitcoiners are buying these gift cards and spending 100% immediately and it's hurting what they can write off. It's clearly a more efficient system so it's tough for a company that works with small margins to ignore. Not to mention it's all over the financial news. Don't give up on walmart just yet, I like to think they're pulling an Apple move here 
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:06:08

Education is the biggest hurdle to adoption in my opinion. It takes about 20 minutes of explanation to understand the very basics. Most people have skimmed a few headlines. We need the price to blow up again to get people to pay attention long enough to educate themselves.

We're going to rethink value as a civilization. Gold's price is not justified by its utility as much as it is by its scarcity. People want something scarce and secure to put their money into and until now the best deflationary assets have been gold and property. Now for the first time we have digital scarcity, in bitcoin, which happens to also have an incredibly efficient payment system built in. I think as the public wakes up to what the blockchain represents, fiat currency is going to feel more and more like a scam, and wall street is going to look more and more like a bubble.
It's going to be difficult for government issued currency to compete with open sourced decentralized deflationary currency, which increases in value as the world economy grows.
I think if you buy bitcoins now quoting their price in dollars wont make sense in 20 years. I also think 1 BTC will more than enough to live comfortably off of.
I realize this is all very radical but I think it's the way things are headed.

The price is going to increase quickly, as it has in the past. I think there will be at least one bubble and pop in 2014 that will bring us over $10,000 / BTC this year, easily. I think the bubble and pop after that will be main stream adoption when the price hits $100,000 / BTC and the media can't help but educate people on what the hell is going on. This might take until mid 2015. Beyond that speculating the price will be is difficult. I do think it will replace Fiat within 10 years. This implies the buying power of 1 BTC will be absurdly high. It's hard to tell what the fair market value of 1 satashi should be but it might surprise us what that amount ends up being.
Main stream acceptance from merchants will probably only take about 2 years. All they need is a smartphone with an app and they have a point of sale system that's cheaper than credit cards. This is a no brainer move for merchants right now and will only become more obvious and common in time. Merchants will be the ones who push its use to the main stream because they're the ones who stand to gain by removing their transaction fees.
As soon as we have Coinbase with insurance (AKA Circle), we basically will have the equivalent of what AOL was to the internet. We're just gearing up to allowing the average person to enter the space with minimal risk which means your $650 bitcoin right now is disgustingly undervalued.

We're still pretty far from mainstream adoption but I think a $450 coin is a bigger psychological barrier than a $20,000 bitcoin. At that point the only people who are watching the price will be investors, the average person will just park money on something like coinbase and spend it but still think of it in terms of dollar value at first. At least that's my take. 
Education is definitely the biggest hurdle to adoption. It's the economic right decision to use / accept it, it's just going to take the market a while to realize that.

A website like this doesn't currently exist because users would have to give their credit card information to some small unknown site in order for it to scale. There is no trust required to send bitcoins to a user's post. Hell, you wouldn't even need an account login.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:19:38
The best part is that the financial markets are going to realize this before consumer adoption even happens. We don't need that upward demand from discounts and volume, the fact that it's possible and probable will push prices higher before the average joe is even using this. 
That's why I think 10,000 / coin is possible this year.

Because if growth in the economy is tied to increased spending power of your money then the middle class gets rich. 
Central banks have been fucking the middle class by ruining their currency and rewarding people who can buy assets to protect themselves against inflation (the rich). This is why wall street is inflated, this is why housing prices are inflated, this is why income inequality is a growing problem.

He wants interest rates to go lower so that people will spend more money to keep the economy afloat. If you have a deflationary currency that increases in value over time it's like having a negative interest rate on a loan that you're holding... so people will spend more because it's deflationary, not less. He's breaking from the mold of what other economists are saying, in favor of bitcoin and he's from an ivy league school which is good PR. Still not understanding why the hate

No, they don't. But buying up mining hardware to mine enough transactions to double spend? The amount you would need to spend is impossible at this point. I guess I'm still not seeing this as an actual issue. The incentives just aren't there, unless it was a government that was afraid bitcoin could replace their current system, so they start buying up all the ASICs for the next couple years to try to sway people to lose trust in the new system. I can't really think of a likely scenario.

I'm not sure if fiat will go away entirely sort of like how the US post office exists even though email made them irrelevant. The barriers to adoption are really low for merchants and the benefits are obvious. If it keeps scaling exponentially it's going to get people's attention more than it already has... It's a financial revolution. I think it's going to destabilize markets and people are going to jump ship on the broken system. Markets react very quickly, this might not take long.

Bitcoin is exciting because it has enormous potential to empower individuals and remove friction from markets. It is also incredibly undervalued which is exciting for investors.

A higher price with less adoption doesn't really make sense.. It's adoption that determines the exchange rate, so no I can't see that happening


There will come a time when people will use it as more than just a speculative investment. It ultimately will be preferred to visa or mastercard because it's cheaper for a merchant to receive bitcoin payment. At that point your friend might only have the option of cash or bitcoin to choose from so if they want to use the easiest method of exchange they will have to make those neck-beards even richer.

Disruptive technologies replacing jobs are what is causing income inequality. I think the problem is with capitalism at this point. Progress as a species is what is making life worse for the middle class and making a few super rich... Bitcoin might actually make these problems worse if it picks up momentum and creates services that replace middle class jobs (brokers, lawyers, bankers). Early adopters will get stupid rich and the middle class will do worse overall. I'm not saying that that makes bitcoin bad, because I think it's good for humanity. I just think we need to start to rethinking how to approach capitalism before it implodes. The birth of a new financial paradigm might be a good opportunity.

In addition to crowd funding, like the dogecar, I bet there's going to be new services to emerge. I think crowd-funding for ideas is an exciting concept.

The burden is already on the customer factored into prices. They just don't know it. This is going to be very popular with merchants and they are going to help the people wake up to what is going on / why this is a better system for everybody. I think it's going to happen pretty quickly too.

Buy $1000 worth of btc, put it in cold storage. $1000 into a mining rig isn't going to be profitable.


I couldn't disagree more. Sellers tend to lock up the market when the price has been moving in the right direction for a while consistently. When nobody is selling and demand increases you end up with a massive price gain in a short amount of time, then a correction that's still pretty damn high. History tends to repeat itself in this respect.

There is a small volume of trades but that doesn't matter.. you only need 1 buyer to set the price higher as long as the sellers collectively agree they should be getting a high price and set the ask price accordingly.

Timing this market is everything, a tiny amount of money early can be life changing. And if you don't think we're still early on you're simply wrong. This is a big fucking deal.

We're still in fringe territory in terms of adoption and a big part of that is because we need more coinbase like services, only insured. If Circle is real then we're ready to scale things up considerably if we can have a walled bitcoin garden that will insure you money for cheap. Until then if you want to invest you need some balls. You need to secure it yourself and that takes some research, that's the price you pay for buying a bitcoin at ~$650. This is a ridiculous undervaluation.

Snowden hasn't released anything related to cryptocurrency though, I think this might pull the rug out from the government before they have time to react. The barriers to entry for people are so minimal.. basically a cellphone with an app and you have a BTC POS system. Bitcoin is going to cause bank runs within the next 5 years. Maybe as soon as 2. That's the end of fiat. I don't think the government has time to be fucking around with ASICs, because right now it's still so small they've barely said much about it.

Matt Miller, you are doing a good thing for the planet educating people about the benefits of bitcoin.
It's simple, we're still trying to find the fair value of this transaction network and people are talking very big ideas. When the price has been rising somewhat consistently on good news sellers lock up the market and the price rises drastically in a short amount of time despite not much increase in demand necessarily (there's also some panic buying that goes on). Then there is a correction and the price gets boring for a while, albeit way higher than before the bubble and pop.
This has happened about five times now and is going to continue to happen until we realize the fair value of this transaction network is the size of the global economy. This is a financial revolution.

Exactly! I just made a post that didn't gain any traction but the interesting thing about the price is that people selling are the ones in control of the bitcoin price. People will buy in at any amount to facilitate a transaction but current holders can sell for whatever amount we (collectively) want. How about we don't sell for anything less than $100.000? Or how about we just don't fucking sell. 5 bucks a satoshi

This gets passed onto the consumer. If we live in a bitcoin economy the price of anything you pay with a credit card will fall by ~2%.

Right now, for me, it's a speculative investment.
It's a better way to transfer money over the internet than any other form of value and investors are speculating that it will become adopted by the mainstream. 
It's admittedly difficult to acquire / secure and not user friendly, but new infrastructure (exchanges, services) will inevitably solve those problems. When that happens, bitcoin is the economic right decision for businesses to accept (no middle-man fees) and demand for bitcoin increases along with the price. There are other factors for demand such as remittances and micro transactions that could also potentially drive the price up. It's also a hedge against another financial crisis.
As for the volatility, that decreases as the price increases.
The people who actually use it for purchasing things are early adopters and like to be ahead of the curve even if it's impractical for the average person. Unless you're interested because you like to test new technology or you're looking for a place to invest (in potentially the most lucrative investment this century), bitcoin probably isn't for you. We'll see you in 3-5 years.

Why should you have cared about the internet in the early 90's? It might not have been for you... The people who are interested / excited about bitcoin understand the potential that it has and are speculating about its future. 
Businesses no longer paying 3% transaction fees, a global currency that moves easily on the internet (and doesn't get inflated out of buying power), micro transactions that could usher in entire new industries on the internet, cheap remittances, ultimately it will become more secure than credit cards (when exchanges / online wallets mature and don't gox things up), plus a whole bunch of other reasons we haven't yet imagined
It's still really early right now. Why would you use it? Because you see the potential and you believe that it is important and good for society to embrace. But if it's not for you, then not for you... yet

You have to understand that bitcoin can do a fuckton more than regular currency.. think stocks and currency merging, beaming money like an email from phone to phone, cut out middle men in global trade, and also it can't be devalued by a central bank. If you want FDIC then don't buy bitcoin. It's only a matter of time before private companies insure bitcoin. When that happens your argument sounds silly and I just made a ton of money.

I'm convinced bitcoin will be the winner. It has the greatest network effects right now, the most people accepting it, the most stories in the news.

It's going to go higher than $64,000. It's going to go higher than $640,000. It's going to replace the current financial system which means 1BTC is going to be A LOT of buying power (It's 100,000,000 units, right?), and it's going to be worth ~1/12,000,000 of the world's wealth. The rich can afford to get in later, yes, but they're going to lose share. And some of them are going to ride the sinking ship all the way down. Some super rich are going to get super richer (the Winklevi), and some poor people are going to be loaded for realizing this is a singularity. 
But that's all besides the point. Deflationary currency is good the middle class. After we convert to a BTC economy, the bigger the world economy, the more purchasing power per BTC. You can actually get ahead living paycheck to paycheck because each of those paychecks buy a little bit more because the world is doing better. Wake up, we're all so stuck in this old way of thinking. This is a revolution.

If it's the economically right decision for people to use it (which it is) the market will react. We just need more security and more user friendly exchanges and wallets which is just a matter of time now. The VC money is at work. 
Your second point scares me the most. The government might try to step on this. They're certainly aware of it. They're certainly divided on what to do about it. But we might just be blessed to have a congress that can't get anything done.

If it works there's going to be some serious consequences. Bank runs, market crashes, probably some serious tax evasion, general financial chaos in the transition to mainstream adoption. If our governments can avoid nuclear war then early adopters will be stupid rich for putting up with the day to day nonsense going on right now and still believing in its future. I think what people are missing is that it could potentially be a worldwide revolution. It might turn the government up the fuck side down and we'll have to rebuild from the bottom up and end up with something way better the the bullshit we have today.

Investing in something and allowing it to exist is adding value to society. 
That's what the entire stock market is based on. "If I give this company my $20 maybe they can turn it into $40." 
In the case of bitcoin it's "this distributed system is way better than our current centralized broken system. Maybe if I buy a chunk and hold on and only use it when it replaces the current system my $20 of value will be $20,000 of value."
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:49:33
The price in USD wont matter but the amount of BTC you hold will
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:15:04
I agree, the writing is awful. I think what Rogoff is getting at is:
Low interest rates are what we need right now so that people borrow / spend more.
Lower interest rates, as in negative interest rates, would be better
Bitcoin, because it is deflationary, can almost be looked at as a negative interest rate loan. Because it appreciates over time, consumers will spend more because they have more.
This is interesting to me because most economists can't get over the fact that it's deflationary. They assume that means people wont spend money because it will be worth more in the future, but Rogoff is breaking from that mold saying it's effect on the economy would be more like people holding negative interest rate loans.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:28:33
If you had trouble giving away hundreds in bitcoin, you'd have a much harder time trying to give away hundreds in litecoin ("what's lightcoin?" "oh, well you know bitcoin?..."). Until the market gets saturated by early adopters like us, the average person doesn't give a fuck because they can't spend it at Walmart.

No, but they might if bitcoins start to look more appealing than cash (which is tied to inflation). 
Hypothetically if bitcoin matures and the volatility goes away, holding bitcoin will increase as the size of the world economy increases, while fiat currency will continually lose buying power.

Think it through though. If this gets big enough and stable enough and we end up with another financial crisis like 2008 which requires us to bail out the banks again we won't have much choice but to use bitcoin would we? Or if the price keeps this bubble pop cycle and it gets big enough that the masses are paying attention we could have bank runs from people panic buying, again, not much choice other than bitcoin. I personally believe it's the only solution to the issues that fiat is running into as we print it into oblivion. Satoshi is then by far the richest person in the world with absurd amounts of liquid cash money. I hope he uses it to put out fires and keep the economy stable / prevent WW3 rather than use it selfishly. But I don't know, I guess I trust human nature. Satoshi is most like ya force for good. I like what they've done so far.
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:09:00
I think the price will take off before consumer adoption.. Early adopters and investors will get rich. I realize that's odd but I think people holding are trying to find the fair value, and I think the fair value is the global economy.. If it hit $100,000 / BTC I wouldn't buy fiat with bitcoin. That'd be a terrible investment at that point.

I had a bitcoin moment when the price was exploding in November and I realized how undervalued it is and that this could change money extremely quickly. Markets react fast.
Then I had another moment when I realize if bitcoin continues to rise in value it's going to dramatically change the computer industry with direct (and absurdly lucrative) financial incentive to make faster and more efficient computers.
I had another moment when I thought deeply about why we even value gold and that it's more that it's conveniently limited than that it's necessarily useful. Precious metals and property are deflationary in nature and are bubbles because they hedge against the inflation in fiat.
I have oh shit moments all the time. This is a revolution.
@_date: 2014-05-02 13:06:01
I think adoption and speculation are the only things causing the volatility, not the actual use of bitcoin as payment system so much. If these were to go away, which they inevitably will, especially when it saturates as much of the market as it's going to saturate, bitcoin will have a second phase of adoption as it's more attractive as a commodity. 


Nobody holding bitcoin would be upset if the price kept rising. You can only call it a bubble so many times and then watch it scale considerably higher than the last "bubble" before people stop and think, "maybe this thing is a huge deal" I can understand that during a run up in price people might be wary to jump in, but a run up in price can only last so long

He wants interest rates to go lower so that people will spend more money to keep the economy afloat. If you have a deflationary currency that increases in value over time it's like having a negative interest rate on a loan that you're holding... so people will spend more because it's deflationary, not less.

You're missing the point. If you want to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange, say for $500 worth of remittances you want to send back home, and the price of 1BTC is $100,000, then you can buy .005BTC transfer it, then convert it back to whatever local currency. The exchange rate doesn't matter to the people who are using the system, so yes, people will "buy in at any amount", even if they are immediately selling it back to another currency
The people who currently hold bitcoins can collectively decide not to sell because they realize this system's grossly undervalued at ~$8billion

I think another consequence will be cheaper housing. Property is one of the few stable deflationary assets that exist so people pay crazy money for homes but I think we're going to rethink that. Can you imagine if rather than hording your money in your home feeding banks with a mortgage you were freeing up that value to invest directly into bitcoin currency/stock

The more people understand the more they seem turned on to the idea. It's inevitable one way or another that we're going to have digital currency. There's a big learning curve and in my opinion that's the biggest thing slowing adoption at this point. If merchants realized they could download an app that replaced their POS system and was cheaper to make transfers they'd be all over this. Just a matter of time now.. this is a freight train that's consistently gaining momentum.

I only pay a small copay so it really wouldn't sway me but over time it'll be more likely that people will be looking for this as an option. That having been said I wouldn't waste you're time getting into LTC and Doge. The bitcoin space is confusing enough for people to wrap their heads around and a dentist accepting dogecoin doesn't really help the movement IMO

How about "with bitcoin you can fuck the banks by making them obsolete"

Seriously.. I didn't see any large spike today at all. I see we're having trouble breaking through the $650 price but over the past month things have been looking pretty fucking up.

I think it's 90% because of 2.

Businesses not wanting to be transparent is good enough reason to allow them to not be transparent? I'm not understanding your argument. I just think more transparency in corporate America would be good for the average person / investors
