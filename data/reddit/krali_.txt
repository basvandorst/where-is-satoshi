Korbit, like all these sites, is an exchange. That is, various people selling their own BTC the price they want to other people. Nothing official.
If it's easy to make international wire transfers to and from Korea, arbitrage will be more efficient and the price will align with other exchanges.

This article is full of errors. Among them:
  * Bitcoin being anonymous
  * Miners being able to mine and submit won blocks including invalid transactions to the blockchain
  * Bitcoin not being a foolproof payment system because of exchanges hacking and scams
  * fees removing BTC from the network
  * thinking bitcoin should be debt based and concluding that, as no one centrally issued them as a debt, the value should be 0.
Such a level of ignorance.

Brain wallet as a concept is ok, but its widespread implementation is far from good. 3 hashes and a pubkey derivation to check a passphrase candidate against a public BTC address is too fast.

"Green bars above the axis represent increases in buy orders" is not what happens on the right side of the current price. This is the side for asks. 
"the increase of buy orders at much higher price than the current price" is not something that can appear on a market depth type of graph, as any such order is resolved instantly.

It seems you're right. In fact it's a whole lot, with average time around 6.5mn instead of 10mn.
Difficulty is changed every 2016 blocks and accounts only for the average of the previous 2016 blocks time. So if hashrate is constantly growing, the difficulty estimation will be off the mark everytime and average confirmation time will be under 10mn.

A word of advice: brainwallet common method generates a private key from your passphrase through a single SHA256 (and then the Bitcoin address with bitcoin's derivation scheme).
This is NOT what is recommended by cryptographers. What should be used is a "Password-based key derivation function" such as PBKDF2. Its internals use SHA256 repetitively, usually a lot of times (you can use 10^6), in order to make it slow. Additionnally a salt is used so that if two people think about the same passphrase, they don't end up with the same private key.
All this makes bruteforcing through wordlists very costly.

You had it perfectly until the ASIC part. ASIC rollouts increase the difficulty and not the money supply as it is fixed per the protocol itself to 1 blockreward/10mn.

I think he is right. But this argument has little value. Intrinsic value is not what makes a money and btw gold intrinsic value is quite low.

The "constitution" of Bitcoin is the protocol itself. 
It cannot be changed without most nodes approval (ie updates), and seeing current involvement from countries with very different cultures, self-entitled "foundations" attempts at changing it will probably fail. The bigger it gets, the more stable it will be.
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:53:14
History differs (See previous crisis times in US, south America, Europe...). Jobs disappear so labor loses a lot of value. For the poor, it means starvation, because going back to the fields is not an option for most.
Then you get civil troubles. If the poor do not die during civil troubles, they get sent to stupid wars or become de facto slaves.

The only bit of misinformation is the use of *mysterious* to designate bitcoin whereas it is in fact completely transparent.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:59:12
Two things :
1/ Bitcoin is a P2P protocol. There is no "they", like in central bank systems. Meaning if you do not respect the protocol or attempt to change parts of it, other peers will simply reject your messages. You'd need to get most peers to adopt your new protocol and it would not be bitcoin anymore.
2/ The block reward is set to halve every 4 years, and sigma(1/2^n) is a convergent series. So, there's an upper limit to bitcoins in circulation.

Financially speaking, BTC is not backed by anything, but neither is the USD since quite a few years ago. You cannot change it into anything at a guaranteed rate.

You failed at politics. And I'm sorry about that, because youth enthusiasm should not be reprimed, quite the opposite.

 *  if you're right and BTC thrives, they were wrong in front of their junior, this hurts their pride and they resent you. You fail
But... you have to learn not to fire up in front of your seniors. Your presenting BTC as the next big thing puts them in front of their own insecurities. What are these people beside glorified casino players ?

Hash functions such as SHA256 have required properties which are interesting to Bitcoin. Pre image resistance, Second pre image resistance, collision resistance.
The bitcoin mining process is a "pre image resistance" class problem. Knowing the resulting hash, you try to craft a block hashing to this result. Though in bitcoin case it's only some constraint on the result and not a precise result, it's the same class of problem.
Replacing a block in the chain would allow double spending of bitcoins spent in the erased block. It more or less requires crafting a block with the same hash as another known block. It is irrealistic because of "second pre image resistance" of SHA256.
Even notoriously deprecated hash functions such as MD4 (used in Windows) don't have **practical** pre image attacks...

The whole network does about 60 THash/s currently. Let's say you want to buy Avalon ASICs to amount to the same. They advertise a rate above 65GHash/s, so you need about 923 of them. It would cost 1.2M$ at launch price. Add power, general purpose hardware and datacenter room to that amount.
I guess a nation state could try and overthrow the network if they invest right now, though they would probably try and design their own ASICs.

Well, it all goes down to the miner who wins the following block.
He won't include the second transactions arrived to him because it will appear as a double spending. And when he wins the block, the second transaction will be known to everyone as double spending, because the won block is included in the blockchain.
Maybe there's another miner somewhere who has received the transactions in the reverse order. If he had won the block, the other transaction would have been confirmed instead.
It is the exact reason why sellers have to wait to see that their transaction is firmly included in the blockchain (ie many subsequent blocks have been added).

One last thing, in cryptography, you should not trust intuition.
