Clicked buy now with Bitcoin as the "normal" payment method and was presented with:
Payment Protection
Not available for this order
Your payment will be sent directly to the seller.  If you experience problems with your order, you won't be able to open a dispute.
Lot's of room for abuse with this, IMHO.
You should have the option to request a moderator for every transaction.
Also, if you select vehicles &amp; parts as your search, it's a bit of everything minus vehicles &amp; parts.

That having been said, there are currently approximately 33 million USD equivalent millionaires globally.  This equates to roughly 33 trillion USD assuming each individual (or family depending on how the stat is formulated) is worth exactly 1 million.   We know that is not the case.  Some are worth far more, etc. further increasing the total net worth of these individuals and families.
If UX and security are addressed for the masses, there is no reason BTC will not far exceed 1 million USD with today's purchasing power within 10 years.  This assumes global or at least widespread adoption in parallel with traditional fiat.
People like to suggest here (parrot) that fiat currency will collapse if BTC goes to 1 million with today's purchasing power.  That's not the case.  If the roughly 2.7 billion unbanked (or a fraction thereof) are able to securely be brought in to the new financial system (this number may be a bit off) this will include a huge chunk of the global population largely not currently participating in the global financial system.
People/trolls here like to consistently say that if BTC hits 1 million in current USD buying power, the world is on fire.  That is just not the case.
Just my .02
Edit:  Further, while some individuals may only have a small position, with time BTC is/will be distributed to the masses.  Those "whales" MAY gift some to their kids or pick your scenario.  Many early adopters are tech geeks and brighter than average people.  Some may splurge if BTC goes nuclear.  Some may be conservative or leave it to their kids/grandkids.  There are a multitude of scenarios that can and will play out.  Not everyone wants a Lambo or the forthcoming Tesla Roadster...

Thanks for the downvote.
If the utility, security and UX are in place thanks to the geniuses currently busting their asses, global adoption doesn't need to even be a factor.
If BTC were to hit 1m in today's USD purchasing power, it would still be a fraction of the wealth of that held by the 33 million wealthiest people on the planet.  -Out of nearly 7.3 billion.
It would almost be a rounding error compared to derivatives.

There is entirely too much to unpack with regards to what you have suggested.
I could go back to my previous post...  I won't.
UX is not an issue according to you.  Theft and loss are not issues..?
If I sent my mom bitcoin right this minute, she would say thanks and not understand what to do.
I'm not entitled to anything.  I was being sarcastic, genius.  Holy fuck people suck.
UX makes a marginalized difference..?  I had the 1st iphone one hour after it came out in the US.  People laughed at me for insisting on being there at the Apple store day one after having the same shitty flip phone for 6 years.
People used dumb phones for a number of years.  Then boom-here we are 12 years later on one front (mobile phones) and 12 on the other (Bitcoin/bitcoin).
Tell me who can see the fiat currency they keep at a bank.  Most all currency has been digital for many years.  The Zeitgeist is what needs to change and will change.

It's not a fair point.  It's dumb.
There are ~32 million millionaires on the planet.
EDIT:  
There are currently less than 17 million BTC to be divided up amongst the global population of whom billions do not have access to financial resources or bank accounts.
People like to parrot the same shit here over and over and over without taking the above into account.
On a global scale, trillions worth of BTC divided by billions of people world wide is nothing.
Even IF bitcoin were to go to 1 million USD even briefly tomorrow, many people would not sell.  It would not destabilize the global economy.  That would equate to far less than double the number of current FIAT millionaires on the planet out of nearly 7.5 billion people.

Edit:  also, most people here do not own shit with regards to bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-08-24 08:38:39
If you believe that is what's happening given that is cascades across the market, you have much to learn.
Mark my words, Arthur Hayes and Bitmex will be found guilty of market manipulation in the not too distant future, among other things.  However, unlike JP Morgan, people will go to jail.
Edit:  Arthur's people and less informed people can upvote the above comment all they want.  That will not alter reality.
Edit 2:  It's not hard to do this across all the exchanges with a few million or less and bots largely running trading.  
Step 1- run the exchange with the most leverage. - Bitmex
Step 2- plant Bitmex bots on every exchange. - Bitmex (duhh)
Step 3- control liquidations to trigger bots across every exchange (see Step 1). - Bitmex
Step 4 - rinse and repeat. - Bitmex
It's pretty simple really.
Edit 3:  Given Arthur's presence on certain shows, I assume certain people already know what he is doing.
He smiles and suggests they just match trades in the above video.  They (Bitmex) watch and then, based on the profit due to shorts or longs, they act.  This guy is a grade-A piece of shit who comes from the banking system and knows exactly what to do.

"'Instruction' (such as English) more as something from an Academic Institution."  Not sure what to say about that.
"Care to Instruct the rest of us what 'Wash Trade' is?" - Have you heard of this thing called Google?  It helps to put the knowledge of the world in your hand.  You can even look up what wash trading is on your own like a big boy.  You can do it-I believe in you.

Nope, I've never used a crypto trading platform.  I never suggested I was and expert.  Trading on a crypto exchange and being able to detect bullshit are two entirely different things.
I've been here since 2013 before most had even heard of this tech.
I say tech because that is what it is.  It's a technology that has solved a decades old comp. problem.  Some people laugh at it as they did the internet.

To me it's entertaining watching people go nuts when it's manipulated up and then whine when the same people drop it.

I have never used a bitcoin trading platform in my life.
You keep directing me to I am the smartest subreddit and mocking me saying I am the smartest.

This is great.  However, until the complexity is abstracted away, BTC will never go global as a mainstream payment mechanism.
I'm somewhat tech savvy having monitored the global network of a large scale business.  Additionally, I've been around since 2013 (despite the date of my Reddit UID.)
Normal people are going to not understand this shit at all.  At all.  They swipe their cards and leave the store.
If the goal now is just store of value, OK.  Even still, only the tech minded will take advantage.
It has been said so many times that it has become a cliche...
My grandmother must be able to use it.  Bitcoin is not even close to that.
My mother used to laugh about the internet.  Now, she uses an iPad everyday for most everything.  She is 66.
Until the UX is dumbed down without sacrificing that which makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, the tech will be left to speculators, bright people in tech and a select few who use it to buy acid on the darkweb.
Far more people use USD to do illicit things so...

I know who you are, Mr. Wuille.  In terms of dedicated computing power for one function, no, the bitcoin network is the most powerful network in terms of computational power.
Ergo, I asked what comes next.
Edit:  did you also not read Mr. Wuille?  I stated in the the post-that is the most powerful network in human history for "a single function."  Perhaps I should have reworded the surpassing Google piece.  In any event, cycle for cycle, the Bitcoin network is more powerful than Google's based on a single function.
The question is, how can it best be utilized.
Edit 2: I feel that people need to understand this and the capabilities afforded by it.  Further, this is a message that is not conveyed.  I have never read anything positive about the global computational capabilities and how they can be leveraged. It's always people parroting things about energy use that is not accurate and never attempts to compare traditional banking energy requirements.  The bitcoin UX currently sucks though.

IMHO, some of the brightest mathematicians and all around brilliant people on the planet are involved with bitcoin/Bitcoin.  That, in itself, should send shockwaves through the Bilderberg group.  Some have quit their very lucrative jobs to devote everything to BTC.
It stoped being a joke to them (people realted to the Bilderberg group) when they realized that some of the brightest people on the planet hate everything they are and have embraced a movement so very very important many here cannot understand.
To many (or most) of them (coders &amp; advocates) it is about fixing and/or undoing the disasters the "grey-hairds" have created.  Of course, many just think they are going to be a gazzilionaire in 2 months.
Some may not understand what is going on, and that is fine, however, within 10 years (i assume-if not sooner), the doubters will globally understand the time and effort associated with writing code that replaces government and makes a level playing field for the entire human populace that is the world.
Old wealth is slowly becoming very cognizant of this.
My .02
Apologies for the wall of text.
Edit:  If I could write code like some of these people, I'd be ecstatic.  The general populace has absolutely no idea what has been done to make their iPhones send messages to fucking satellites in space and most have not idea that is even involved.  It's magic. :P  
The people involved with tech dev. in general are fucking geniuses.  This decades old comp. sci. problem's solution (that is Bitcoin) was pushed to the public anonymously.  The bright people get it.  Ultimately, that is all that matters.
Everything said and done, I have always sided with the brightest minds in tech even before many reading this were eagerly anticipating the first iPhone.
If Arthur Hayes and Bitmex can be stopped in terms of fucking with bitcoin and public perception, that would be a huge win.

As I began reading this article, I decided this was a decent summary of bitcoin/Bitcoin in layman's terms and I would forward it to my parents...
Came to the end of the article and read:
"Today, the Bitcoin network has become a sluggish behemoth that consumes more electricity in a year than the entire country of Switzerland and takes hours upon hours to verify a simple transaction."
The author fucked up at the end, IMHO.  Nothing stated about the percentage of renewables used by miners and nothing mentioning the amount of energy currently used for the global ATM network or bank presence to present a comparison.
Edit:  Of course, the "hours upon hours" part is also bullshit.
Edit:  This is also incorrect: "Transactions awaiting confirmation are placed in what is termed a ‘block’. "

3/4 of the people who own bitcoin have the delusion that they will be gazillionaires in a few months and that corporate America along with FOMO is going to make it happen.  
It IS NOT going to happen.  Get your heads out of your asses and stop posting memes because you have no lives.
3/4 or more of the people here are ignorant trash.
If any network news, The Simpsons, Family Guy (pick your show or movie) makes a reference, there are 20 posts here about it and every incel is stroking their dick typing in unison that they made it.  "This is huge.  - not their dicks."
Then the other side says if bitcoin goes to 1 MILLION dollary doos a loaf of bread will cost at least 10k USD and civilization will have collapsed.
There is so much stupid here I'm done with this place-not that it matters in the slightest to all of the trolls.  I am nobody.  How Bash &amp; Theymos keep their cool is beyond me.
1.146 million supposed subscribers to this subreddit.  Of that I'd wager AT LEAST 1/4 of them are robots/spam/duplicate accounts (and that is most likely being generous.)
Many here are upvoting a pornstar endorsing a company involved with bitcoin.
That's all you've got really.  A couple people with a bit of cash to give to a retired porn star to take a picture in a shirt with a logo?  Yaaaaay.  We made it.  Fuck the Fed.  they're not serious 'cause they print a gajillion dollars and suck Jamie Dimon's teet.

I actually knew in 2011 but I was not comfortable wiring money overseas and it was already borderline too late to mine on my own.
Now, people like you are here creating websites with stupid names and swinging theirs dicks around patting themselves on the back for how bright they are.

False.  This topic is brought up somewhat routinely here.  
Consensus is that if SHA256 is broken by QC, we have bigger things to worry about given that the world as we know it (traditional financials, etc) is based on it.  All that is needed for bitcoin is a consensus to change the hash algorithm which would most likely take a solid 10 minutes to get majority support.

A single btc is worth somewhere between 2 &amp; 5 million USD at current USD buying power.

No man.  You're yet another person trying to push bitcoin into the same framework as traditional asset classes.
You know what happens with people who pull this shit, eventually they get called out like JP Morgan and metals.
I'm telling you now that people are rigging bitcoin across every exchange.

This is stupid and everyone parrots it.  There are more than 32 million millionaires on the planet currently as the global population continues to grow.  
In the grand scheme of things, a 1 million USD bitcoin valuation will have little effect especially given that many will continue to remain in cold storage.
Edit:  For people upvoting this "parrot genius," you either know Jamie Dimon in some capacity, are completely clueless or are completely clueless.

1.) "where the big boys plays."  The big boys don't play here.
2.)  They are "Legos."
3.)  Pennies not "penny's"
4.)  Technically @ symbols are not used here. Instead you should use reddit.comor just - regardless, you didn't even get his/her username right...
5.) It's BTC not Btc
I would say to you and others like you that if you are not intellectually capable, do not play here.  Most people with any decent amount of bitcoin do not post here with the few exceptions of dev posts and a select few others.
Some of your post could be explained away due to language barriers, I suppose.  Some due to a lack of familiarity with Reddit.
There's just too much wrong with that one fragmented sentence.  I'm done.

Some genius already downvoted me.  Perhaps you are employed by Google?
Bitcoin is more powerful.  The hashrate is growing constantly.  Bitcoin doesn't collect data like Google or Facebook.
Fuck Google and fuck Facebook.

Go look outside.  Clearly it has been a while since you did so.

Not sure if you're being sarcastic.  Nothing much left to say.
Parents were anti-bitcoin. Criticized me for putting money in to help support it
My father found his mother dead on the floor with a phone in her hand.  Years later he used some of what she left him to put his faith behind what was going on.
No extraordinary situations.
Edit:  I made him a persistent Ubuntu drive and explained everything to him.  I found out 2 years later he formatted the USB key because he had no idea what it was.
I was fucking furious.
Yes, I thought he would fuck it up  because I saw dementia setting in.  I made a safety net.  
You don't expect someone here since 2013 to lose something personally or family do you?
That is not how the story ended.
The point is, my father has developed severe dementia.  If I had entrusted everything to him without suggesting "let's watch and see what happens," he would have deleted everything without any idea.  I kept multiple backups.
The UX needs to be fixed.  No sane lay person will ever use bitcoin until that happens.  FUCKING PERIOD.  Draw your dumb fucking charts all you want.  It will not happen.

...it will all come out soon.

Arthur Hayes of Bitmex and his bots on the exchanges are responsible.
@_date: 2019-09-08 06:05:06
Is that the new phrase, "throwing words together?"
Coinbase will absolutely monetize transactional information.
Fuck Coinbase and fuck Facebook.
Mark Fuckerberg belongs in jail.

What is this "we" you speak of?
Are you referring to the people who post here and own virtually no BTC that constantly post to the moon shit?
Don't listen to anyone here with regards to performance.
If some random person actually knew how BTC, or any asset, was going to perform, he/she would not publish it.  
With regards to their naming, as another poster suggested, it may be a combination of hot and cold wallets.  Who knows.
People here still think TA is accurate.  Some ransom person is trying to give you a head's up posting lines on a chart.
The so-called 4Chan prophet is also wrong.  Things are not going up that much in the next 4-5 weeks.
For reference:
Some of you helped elect our current President so, clearly, you have solid judgemental skills.
You believe anything some random person pulls out of their ass.
If they are attempting to change the mind of the hydra it will not work out well for them.  It's hot and cold.  Period.
Pretty much nobody gives a shit about BAKKT.  Some used it to pump and dump on news.  Nobody cares.
@_date: 2019-09-08 08:05:02
I would kick the fucking shit out of whomever downvoted this almost immediately if I could.
You have no fucking idea what dealing with this is like.  I hope you never need to deal with it.  Not fun.
