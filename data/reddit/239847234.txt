A private, decentralized trading market that requires an in-person invite to join. (Maybe this invite code can only transfer over BLE or NFC?)

This. Agreed!

bitcoin, in many ways, is about the redistribution of power and wealth. perhaps we should take a 'growth hacking' approach and see what we can do for the greatest gains?

Why has volume slowed to a crawl?

I think adding the yelp logo to a bitcoin sticker design is something we should wait for yelp approval on. I don't want to see some sort of trademark issue, or business owners who refuse to use the sticker because of redundancy (they already have a yelp sticker).
My question for everyone is: Would sending a normal Bitcoin sticker to each bitcoin-accepting business provide less value than the same sticker with the yelp logo?
My 2 satoshis: Create a community fund for stickers and send them to business owners for free. And give one to anyone who donates more than a dollar or two.

Great points on PR. Not sure if a Foundation would help, or if community projects are the better option.
Great write up.

I'm 100% behind tipping. We'd start a work-revolution if this sort of economics takes off.
The future isn't going to be about doing work for 1 entity and receiving one big chunk of payment every two weeks.
It's going to be about creating value for everyone around you and getting hundreds of micropayments for your effort and passion.

Even though the article is dated from today, are we sure it just wasn't published today? It refers to the news on the 25th that caused the last slump.

Many many reasons; I agree. They're generally unethical and many small business owners dislike them a lot. Same with groupon.
I work in this space and talk to small business owners all over. This plan (with both logos) would do more to confuse them. Trying to promote bitcoin through its' affiliation with Yelp while not actually representing Yelp won't help.
