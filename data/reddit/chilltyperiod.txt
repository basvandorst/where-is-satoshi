I think having one withdrawal address makes you more vulnerable, because even if you use that one as a hot wallet, and you would push through to other addresses, if you get hacked / keylogged it is fairly simple to hack that hot wallet.
Or a hacker can track your activity and capture when you will withdraw.
I see the positive side, but it is not yet the perfect solution.
A lot of systems are compromised anyway or you should think yours is anyway.
Unless its a cold storage address generated offline, but if you use it as money you don't want it to go in cold storage.

How could we EVER get evidence that they are stolen? 
Meaning that the balances are gone to other addresses doesn't prove that this all is a profitable bankruptcy by Mark Karpeles himself. 
If HE smuggled a few hundred coins out every month with no one looking into it we could never prove it wasn't done by himself. 
And the fact that bitcoin isn't legal tender yet means that you can't prosecute him for the true value of the losses.

This is the answer I got from Jef Garzik, core developper on the Bitcoin team, when asked about the potential danger of the 51 attack.
"This is a "problem" that will correct itself without developer
intervention.  51% has never been a worry in practice.  It is just
something people on reddit like to talk about."
So it seems that this guy does not feel threatened at all by any kind of 51 attack.

They can do a massive double spend and some people might actually buy in at a VERY low price after (some) damage is done, gaining a 130% / 150% / 200 % on the bitcoins they bought. They could even sell alot of bitcoins just before a huge attack, and then rebuying after the community stabilizes again after some time.
We do not know their intentions, as we do not know these people AT ALL. 
I see ALOT of money-making potential in being able to perform such an attack. Before, during, and after the attack.

Well, if the auction is open to public, they will be sold at it's true market value at that time. 
The true market value is what people at THAT moment are willing to pay for it.
I think this will end up in people paying market prices. In auctions sometimes people pay even MORE than market price for products, just because they are in a bidding war and want to win.
If some bitcoins are sold in bulk I think this would be interesting for big investors as they would probably have the chance to buy some bitcoin UNDER market value, as there are fewer bulk buyers, as there are fewer people with alot of cash. 
They are just extremely valuable, and I'm not the only one thinking that. So don't think they will be sold at half their prices.

Go over to their website, 
-&gt; it's a way to "buy-in" influence.
If you lay down 25 grand you get to put up their "Bitcoin Foundation Approved" sign, a seat in the board, tons of networking opportunities and advanced sayings about sponsorships (read VC opportunities).
Basically, this sounds to me as a "behind the scenes" club who don't get my trust at all and is only driven by money, not a body of integrity.
I would want to see a foundation that is almost non-profit, driven by enthusiasts, that really audit a company before giving any status of approval and not just because they paid $25.000 dollars.
Mark Karpeles still being in there is just because he paid alot of money (Mt Gox is a "gold member"- $25.000 US Dollar).
I would be willing to give this idea a go and see what the free market prefers most.

Nice post dude, it's the truth. 
We don't know the future of bitcoin. 
Nobody does.
 "Investing" directly in bitcoin by buying up bitcoins is a huge risk. You could lose a lot of money. 
Even when you are on top of the news making the right calls can be hard. Timing the market is a risky business and a rookie mistake that will lose you more money in the long run than it will bring you short term.
Do not overlook this, especially for the people investing and trading for the first time. Trading and trying to time this market is going to end up bad in the long run and is pure speculation.
It then becomes more like betting. Nobody can accurately keep on predicting what the market will do next.
It is the skill of making more winning positions than losing, and you should be very proud if you have a 20% profit next year, on your initial investment.
Some people will go against me, but don't forget you are not there yet. Nobody is.
Be aware. Investing can be fun, but it brings huge risks in this market.

There are no problems at all, they are crashing the bitcoin price on purpose:
Big investor(s) want to buy in BIG at a LOW price.

They pressurize Mt Gox, to come up with a problem that would affect bitcoin as a whole. 
They stop sending out bitcoins. -&gt; People panic.
They wait for it to become huge news, and the price to crash, and THEN release the bitcoins.
-&gt; Now some folk make millions.

Clearly the NSA didn't push through,
maybe these guys decided to release it themselves, calling them Satoshi Nakamoto.
Probably they put a lot of work in it, were passionate about cryptography and wanted to release it themselves.
Not far-fetched. 
In this case, the need for anonimity is clearly obvious.
They probably signed a ton of contracts that would put them away for a long time after having worked for the NSA.

As a psychologist I can gladly say bitcoin and it's enthusiasts are not a cult, at all.
I am sorry to say, but this is the reason why a licensed doctor, psychologist or psychiatrist are the only persons who are permitted to apply diagnoses to patients, 
or else we would all have cancer, schizophrenia, borderline and live in a cult ;-)
We even get education on how to un-google patients these days. They already diagnose themselves on Wikipedia. Biased by their own perceptions and convinced they have a or x. 
Sometimes, this leads to them not perceiving other symptoms, pushing their perceived symptoms toward a certain diagnose.
Edit; I must say I speak for my experience only.
+ It is true that the bitcoin enthusiasts may place well in some of the categories, but there are underlying principles beneath all of the definitions given.
And, these definitions do not place a value needed for each point specifically to be a cult.
We don't cut ties, we don't get isolated, we don't act out that we would have seen as unethical before (I hope).
We DO downvote alot AGAINST bitcoin, but that has to do that we, bitcoiners, are an established group in our social identities. We are biased and favor in-group support. -&gt; read: we love good bitcoin news.
Plus; we made a (social) commitment when we bought in our bitcoins, this also biased our perceptions; we (want to) see the positive news, we want to reaffirm that our choice is good, and so we ''explain away'' (or downvote) the negative news.
This is what's happening all the time.
So: no, bitcoiners are not a cult, but they are a strong social group.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:41:50

there are new blocks mined every day, so there will be a supply, and even if one party keeps buying that supply as well, there would be a huge skyrocketing of the price per bitcoin, as liquidity is now extremely low and the only people willing to sell of a bit of their BTC are people like us (who are then instant millionaires)

''Dear customer,
we must bring to your attention that you are paying with Bitcoin. 
If you want to return the product, a refund in bitcoin is not possible. You will get the US Dollar value back of the product sold, as of the date you bought the item.
Let us explain why we cannot refund your bitcoins:
When we accept your bitcoins, we immediately convert them to US Dollars, minimalizing the risk of loss due to volatility of the currency.
Hence why we cannot have a return policy with bitcoins refunded to you. 
If you return a product purchased with Bitcoin, you will receive the US Dollar value for the product.
We hope you understand this and by paying with Bitcoin you agree to this policy.
In the future our policy might change, but we accept bitcoin to serve your needs and hope you understand our choice in refund policy.

For the average consumer in a first world country, there is no NEED yet to own bitcoin. People get their salaries nice on time, it's fucking safe; the bank will cover your loss if you were skimmed, hacked or robbed in front of an ATM. 
It is pretty fucking frictionless already.
It is not instantly with deposits and transactions, but merchants believe you if you swipe your card and it beeps green.
Bitcoin is nice, but people don't care how a credit card is made and what technology is behind it, people care about the service, security and flexibility.
Bitcoin is up against something so vast change isn't happening anytime soon. 
What about the statements that banks are antique and all. That's bullshit, all currency in Euro is virtual and encrypted already, unless you take it out of an ATM. Only at that moment it becomes "real".
Sure, RBS lost €46Bn in the last six years, of taxpayers money, but what is 46Bn in a global economy of trillions?
Let's face it. Bitcoin is not a special storm trooper yet. It is a diamond in the rough, 
and we need to polish it ASAP.

I have to agree with peaceisreason -
We do not live in a world where care-free, naïve and innocent thinking is stimulated. 
We encounter daily SO much deceit, deception and persuasion from the entities that should represent, serve and empower us, that paranoia is becomming a necessity, to have some kind of private inner protection that keeps you awake to the truth.
When you accept how this world works and what mechanisms are at control you cannot be carefree or naïve anymore.
People whom are paranoid alot (like myself) are people who are perveived as (a bit) crazy, or believing in "conspiracies". 
I am just a person who refuses to turn a blind eye, ever.
Take a look at Wikileaks. 
Really READ some top leaks.

With that package you get to put up the "Bitcoin Foundation Approved" sign on your website. 
Included without your business actually getting audited in some way.
That puts a lot of trust for new people in certain businesses that could be the greatest scammers.

You forget the new coins mined each day allowing more capital to come in without an extreme rise of value.
The fact the value ISN'T decreasing with thousands of new coins coming in each day means there is alot of capital flowing in each day. So from a statistical perspective, fiatleak has a point.
It is merely presented as more of a "gimmick" than that it actually provides stable, statistical data. This could be changed though.

This is typical in-group vs out-group behavior from both sides.
What the "dogecoiners" correctly point out is the false consensus adopted on this subreddit; that "bitcoin is THE digital currency that will be worth millions, and if you don't agree, then piss off" 
This is the strong power a group can exert, as I fell prey to this as well, only looking at the positive sides of bitcoin.
But the same goes for dogecoin. They will think of themselves as superior of bitcoiners in some way. Seeing us less diverse and more homogenous. Just us we see them.
What we all want is cryptocurrencies to succeed in this world, whether it be dogecoin, bitcoin or litecoin.
And which one it will be? We all don't know yet. 
We are all people, and we all fall prey to stupid bias, on both sides of the fence.
When people start seeing each other as groups, bad things can happen as history demonstrates. 
Let's see each other as fellows with a mutual goal.

But fortunately, merchants can keep on adopting it, without loss of risk in the price volatility. A lot of exchanges have banded together to reassure that they are on top of their security. 
Bitcoin is still growing, but what I do think is REALLY important, that something like THIS, doesn't happen again in the near future. 
It's the dumb f*cks that try to make a lot of buck out of bitcoin that screw up.

The real risk lies into the fact that nobody can foresee the legal future of bitcoin. If in any way depositing USD &amp; EUR &amp; etc. into exchanges will be banned and the use of bitcoin in itsself, bitcoin will lose enormous value and yes, it could die.
I am not a lawyer, and banning the bitcoin itsself I don't think it is possible, because it is not malicious in any way. But governments CAN create an extremely harsh environment to obtain and use bitcoins.
If you can't spend bitcoin or exchange it with something else of value, it will not have value.
Bitcoin is backed by fiat. It is not the other way around, not nearly.
And this is the truth. 
I love bitcoin, but as an investor I must acknowledge the downsides to the story as well (although I love every little victory bitcoin makes).
If bitcoin's adoption will continue to grow and somehow it will truly become a revolutionary tool, having 1 BTC will be more of an asset. 
Hence the ''crazy'' quotes from people saying 1 BTC can be worth a million USD one day. 
And theoretically, it can.
21 million coins, 7 billion people. 
Let's say 2 billion people will use the bitcoin daily and demand it on a regular basis. The price of 1 BTC could be tremendously high, keeping in mind it will still have 90% market share.
About the hacks I wouldn't be worried. The network that verifies bitcoin transactions grows each day and with every computer. When used properly it is - ultra - safe.
The more people use it, the safer it gets.
Governments already issued alot of warnings, that the use can be risky, due to the volatility and if not used properly due to hackers. 
This lies not in the bitcoin protocol itsself, but in a weak secured computer/network. Making keylogger software a tool to extract your private keys.
So yes, it could crash and die, but this will not be the last cryptocurrency in any way from now on. It has opened the world toward a whole new dimension of exchanging information in any kind of way.
Or, when adoption keeps growing and governments accept bitcoins (or at least not try to decrease it's value) it can become a big player with 1BTC having a huge pricetag.

Perhaps the 39% now is because WE warn against them. It was 42 not long ago. That is a drop of 3%.
But even if THIS threat is avoided it is not a long term solution, because THIS will happen AGAIN! 
Mining becomes more and more difficult leading mining towards big companies. These can acquire a 51% again.
The bitcoin protocol MUST be changed somehow to prevent any party EVER having a 51% total hash rate capacity. 
I've sent an email to all core developpers adressing this issue.
I am not a programmer or bitcoin expert, but here come economics into play.
Now we have to self regulate by warning each other on forums and asking people to switch over to another pool, but again, any other pool can achieve 51% as almost happens today with Ghash.io
I sincerely hope this 51% attack problem gets permanently solved, because IF a massive 51% attack DOES occur in the near future it affects the whole bitcoin trust we have reached so far!!
This could prevent major adoption.

Putting bitcoins into cold storage on a completely 100% (digital) secured way is still WAY TOO difficult for the average person- put your internet completely offline, use an (old school) offline printer, and wipe your caches. And then still, the key was generated on your computer, so it needs to be 100% malware free. 
The operational security that bitcoin requires, is not met by the average digital banking user.
This has to be simplified to compete with mainstream banking or else it will become a niche.

I know I need this done, but it's something that takes time for somebody who doesn't understand things like an Ubuntu live disc.
And then I read; "how can we trust the creator of the live discs?"
So that makes me scared again, thinking that I can suddenly lose my coins in the future.

Also, the amount of bitcoin you pay to each product is automatically updated so that you will experience no loss (and no extra profit) from the curremt volatile price of bitcoin.

It will become easier, but when the wheel was invented it didn't have ferrari as an instant user.
It has to evolve, these people need to build applications that run seamlessly, which takes time. Everybody need to get their head around the bitcoin protocol and how we can implement it. 
Sure, a creditcard swipe is instantly fast, but it had to be invented once. 
The same thing will happen with BTC. 
It is so young and new. People will not even go to mac donalds YET, because they don't have the propper carriers YET to present it working seamlessly.
Go invent!
It is a new technology, how can you expect from a baby to walk like an adult in a couple of years time? You don't.

What you say is true, it is because of major adoption and the
