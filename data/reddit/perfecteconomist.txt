Can you help me understand how bcash is scam? I know roger ver is unstable but when bcash fees are much cheaper and faster than core, seems like core is the scam and not bcash. 
I don’t hold bcash btw but just wanted to understand why bcash was a scam

Bitcoin has more value than oil? Do we need to get into that argument? lol.
Market forces does decide.
And just like all technology, old tech will die out and new tech will triumph in.
There are coins that’s serves bitcoins purpose but better. 
Market will see that there’s no value in holding onto old tech, like an iPhone 1 or the first Samsung galaxy.
But profit while you can cause the general public is slow to react

Bitcoin is not the future.
The idea is, the technology is, but it’ll eventually die like all other hyped speculative “assets”.
One bitcoin should not be worth more than 1K.
People are irrational and produce herd like behaviors hoping to make profit this is ridiculous. 
This is a fragile unregulated market and it’ll end bad.

Is bitcoin private? No. Monero is. Pixv is. 
Is bitcoin freedom? That’s a subjective question.
I can shout how bananas are freedom. 
The idea of bitcoin is great. It does provide alternative methods for people to transact without having to rely on financial institutions.
But 10K+ for an old outdated tech? Just like all tech, old ones die out and new ones triumph in.
If bitcoins purpose is for ease of transaction from point A to point B with no middlemen, then there are already much better alternatives
