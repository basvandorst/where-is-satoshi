so lets say you have a paper wallet with 100k and export your private keys to blockchain.info. you only spend $100 and have $99,900 left. Do you create a new paper wallet and move the rest of that money into a paper wallet (new) again?

Are they one time use and then the change goes back to the next bitcoin address? 
are the balances split between all these bitcoin addresses you generated for a paper wallet?

luckily with bank of america..
"When your account is overdrawn, the balance is negative. You have to bring the balance positive (by putting money into the account), or else you will be charged an extended overdraft fee. At Bank of America, you would be charged another $35 if the account is negative for 5 days."
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:02:16
