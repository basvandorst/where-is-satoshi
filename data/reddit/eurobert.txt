I don't. The 1-day redditor submitted that "Ponzi schemes are not meant to be understood. People that do understand them, get hired by the central banks that create debt slavery. It's all one big system to abuse everyone."
The redditor feels that "Bitcoin will be no different: they will track everything digitally -- no more anonymous paper money."
I think (s)he may have a point...

[I]( the beginning, the Nakamoto created the Block Chain. Then He saw the Block chain, and He saw that it was good, so He created the Genesis block. And Satoshi spake: "Bring forth a currency from the block chain, and let it be called Bitcoin."
Bitcoin Address.
Satoshi blessed the bitcoins and said unto them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and liberate the people. Rule over the money-lenders and cast out the middlemen and the regulators and gatekeepers and all manner of partypoopers of sour countenance".
On the next day, in an afterthought, He created the sky and the Moon. And He spoke to his followers: "Behold these private keys, for I shall entrust them upon you, so that thou mayest share thy wealth with all brethren on this Earth."
Having spoken these words, He cast Ten Thousand coins, and behold, two pizzas were produced. The Nakamoto said to his desciples: "Eat from this food, it is priceless, remember me by it." And there was great salivation...

The Pirate Party creates a novelty in the payment of the deposit: the party wanted to pay the 11,250 euro deposit at the Electoral Council in Bitcoins. ,,Only, the government will not accept this kind of cryptocurrency - or: digital currency'," explains board member Michael Dulfer. Through an online currency exchange, ,,we converted this digital currency into euros and still paid our refundable deposit.''

The (provisionally refundable) deposit of 11,250 euros was already paid - fully funded from bitcoin.

"Plus or minus 3 - 5% [..]"
Nope. Read the ethereum graph. This is an **11% price drop** in about 90 minutes.
EDIT: To be more precise, ETH price fell from about **$363** around 11:00 AM to precisely **$325.00** at around 12:15PM. The two graphs are NOT about providing a comparison of 12h or 24h price differences. Instead, they clearly show the sudden big price movements, disproving the NYT's headline that ether would be [the digital currency of "the" moment](

Thanks for the topic! Another [source]( reports:
IT advisor Kristoffer Hansen from Trondheim has been following digital currencies for five years, and thinks we are not yet near the top, according to Norwegian newspaper Dagens Næringsliv (DN).
There has been no lack of warnings about bubbles and collapse, and price swings have often been violent.
DN asks if it is not *tough to bet so hard with a currency that fluctuates so much.*
"Do not look at the small fluctuations; look at the long term, and think where bitcoin will be in five to ten years," Hansen says to the newspaper.
