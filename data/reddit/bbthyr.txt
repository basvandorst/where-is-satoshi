"Additional fees" are most likely the fees you are paying for your two way security through "TrustedCoin". You are paying for a package of future transactions. You are able to choose a smaller "package" wich is more expensive per transaction but much cheaper overall (less transactions prepaid). To do so click on the blue icon on the bottom right of your Electrum Software.
You really should know the fees of the wallet you are using yourself tho..

I'm happy somebody brought it up. I'm not sure if this story even happened, but even considering suicide because you didn't get rich (not even lost your money) is beyond fucked up. Eitheir there are some enormous other factors involved or there is a literally unimaginable crazy attitude to money present.

I can´t tell if you are being sarcastic, but i literally never heard of that reasoning before and i studied finances.

I actually do trade for some time now but was fairly limited in my marketplaces. Coinbase just seemed unbelievably simplified and i wanted to make sure my impression was correct. Thank you tho.

Just a quick question: I just registered on coinbase to test it out and there are no individual buy/sell orders but just one unified price? Is coinbase some sort of "lite" or "amateur" platform?

That's not how markets work.

I personally believe there will be a correction as i don´t think there will be a sufficient influx of buyers on the verge of 10k that could serve all those sell orders. 
Nobody knows for sure tho.
