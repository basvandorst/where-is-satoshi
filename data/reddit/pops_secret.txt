That is the same question but worded slightly more simply.

Man the stock market has been roaring for years. Equity research has really made valuation far less influenced by dark, unknown forces. Not to say there aren’t some huge assumptions being made, but for established companies (i.e. Intel) prices are extremely stable. 
Last I checked, the funds were growing 12%-15% per year, so not bad for an investment strategy that costs no time or anxiety. The beauty of Vanguard is (obviously) their low fees and the fact that they just buy the whole market, on the assumption that stocks are valued appropriately based on what hedge funds are doing (hedge funds are the largest consumers of equity research).
Pardon me if you knew all this, I only ranted because some might not.

Pretty high confidence interval that the level of risk I take will impede aging past mid-late 50’s. 
(Joking, I invest 15% pre-tax in a couple different Vanguard funds. I’m extremely risk averse and would rather blow most of my cash on dumb shit than possibly give it all to a few assholes who are going to make it hugely rich off Bit at others’ expense)

Yes it’s true, I was misremembering. Still enough to cause a mass panic and investor exodus if someone cashed them in.

Unintentional hyperbole. I had originally heard that years ago when there were fewer bitcoins that had been mined.

[Half ]( of all bitcoin are not even visible to the market and are held by one (vvv wealthy) man.

I don’t bother hoarding money, this is survival for fun.
