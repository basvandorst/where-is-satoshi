Received both of these on January 13. Paid the 5% fee, and hassled customer service on almost a daily basis.

Was contemplating building a canadian exchange for bitcoins back in 2011, but lacked the programming know-how. Acquired said know-how, and am now kicking myself after cavirtex's IPO :)

Are vaporizers illegal? I know that there are large sites that publicly advertise on google and accept real money for vaporizers. I'm not sure vapes are quite in silk road's category.

Though many of the statements in this cease and desist are pretty far off the mark, it appears as though this bit does apply:
"or any network of people who engage as a business in facilitating the transfer of money domestically or internationally outside of the conventional financial institutions system"
It could be argued that Bitcoin Foundation, as it puts resources towards the development of the software running bitcoin and bitcoin wallets, facilitate the transfer of money (Bitcoin).

I don't understand this fully, but conceptually I think you're saying that the flaw is in an infinitely rising price within a finite system. Interesting that there is a 1% chance the chain would reach all the btc in existence (given no resets from time expiring). I'll have to do a bit of research into long-tailed distributions and finite means :). Thanks for the nice explanation

A little bit of a different problem...I've initiated two withdrawals of $10,000 CAD this past week , and don't see either of them in my account history. Has this happened to anyone else? Is this normal, or should I be concerned?

Not to be a negative nancy, but aren't there legal implications to running a gambling site? I believe in most countries, anything convertible to real currency is subject to gambling law.

So how do you guys get all your data from the 3 exchanges - is it all through their API's?
