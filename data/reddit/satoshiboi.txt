So true.  Sometimes I just need to vent a little
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:01:59
If it hits 100k , I'll buy real estate lol
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:40:22
How does a 25 bps cut in the federal funds rate translate to a plus for BTC hodlers lol?
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:58:16
I'm not trying to win anyone over.  I was just pointing out general financial ignorance I see in some of my contemporaries.  There's nothing wrong with keeping the majority of your net wealth in your house...to each their own.
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:57:34
I think it's incorrect to refer to the house you live in as an investment...I would call that consumption.
I'm just being critical of their ignorance...not real estate in general
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:51:23
Wise words.  These are trusted friends.  Still dull though

If the day ends in 'y' Then Buy BTC
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:28:31
I think borrowing money to purchase a depreciating asset is delusional... Where do you keep your wealth?
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:24:27
My critisicms are saved for hypocrites, not real estate

@_date: 2019-07-31 21:42:51
It's satire bro.
But this isn't - BTC will be relatively cheap until we are over a trillion USD market cap.  Then it'll be fairly priced.
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:28:57
Banning Bitcoin would be like banning reefer - silly and impossible.
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:53:36
You ain't seen nothing yet
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:43:06
I literally said "I'm diversified" - read the post again lol.  And I do love to gamble - there aren't many vices I dislike..
but when it comes to BTC it's not a gamble - just vanilla speculation.  
The same kind of speculation that goes into plenty of real estate purchases
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:31:14
It's all relative
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:12:15
Thanks for letting us all know.  I don't have my life savings in crypto - read more carefully - I was only pointing out financial ignorance and hypocrisy.
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:06:02
The federal funds rate is simply the rate that banks lend to each other overnight.
Marginal changes in these rates by central planners don't have much of an effect on crypto markets.   
They're best to be ignored.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:35:39
Solid at pumping out statists lol
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:35:08
What do you mean by " religious style psychological manipulation " ?
You don't think the price is cheap right now?
@_date: 2019-07-28 11:51:33
I love anyone who avoids taxation.... especially corporations!  Down with the state and their sympathizers!!

They'd have more luck banning property ownership - and after listening to some presidential hopefuls that's not too far off!

Great post, have you seen Jeff Snider's 'Eurodollar University' ?
He talks greatly about bank balance sheet capacity and shadow banking in general...seems like we're heading for another liquidity crisis.

How can a system that admonishes private wealth and capital believe in Bitcoin?  Bitcoin enables an escape from statism.

Libertarian socialism sounds like an oxymoron to me lol....but my meme is critizing state socialism, not the version that you are advocating for.  We all get lost in semantics.
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:59:29
Whoa, spoiler alert
@_date: 2019-06-29 11:23:45
Not really.   Assets are measured across relative time periods all the time.  And the USD dollar has lost 80 percent of its value, but over a much longer time period.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:59:16
Last I checked, USD still liquifies global trade.  Seems silly to call it "fake".

You just want your college loans forgiven.  BTC is digital capital.  Socialists despise capital in private hands.  Your Bitcoin hobby and statist ideology are at odds with each other.

Money dealers are desperate for liquidity that doesn't exist.  The Fed is attempting to alleviate pressure on those funding markets by allowing those dealers access to excess reserves.
