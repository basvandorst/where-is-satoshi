Bubbles burst like the bs that get spread
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:05:54
Btw why don't you preach your stuff where BTC is not known lmaoo
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:13:04
I'm still waiting for that 3k pump
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:44:53
No manipulation. BTC is legit like everything that leads to a sharing of easy money to all its commercial actors involved
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:17:12
According to latest tendencies, it could possibly be either female or male : )
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:08:28
It doesn't mean it was meant to be a scam. They could have dead meanwhile, or it could be a way to give anyone time to jump in before the price gets too high, etc. Many possible reasons. I still think it will reach 50k.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:32:45
Close your eyes to make sure their mind is dead too
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:50:05
Main fud topics are tied to regulations and ban, not manipulation
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:43:24
Edited, thanks lol
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:03:53
3k pump coming I can FEEEEEEEEL it
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:53:53
For example?
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:33:28
That looked different, too vertical, as if someone bought and then sold once a bit fomo kicked in
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:56:21
Someone forgot to unpack the lamp before the casting omg
@_date: 2018-05-26 06:20:59
Scandals lower the prices, that's good for cryptos lol
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:33:09
Or poke it again....
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:50:06
I don't take any crypto guru seriously, on the opposite
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:47:46
I see different numbers
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:41:24
I'm going to shut up one week as protest
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:28:27
How do you know they're not money coming from cashing out btc. Such an half thinking
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:30:56
@_date: 2018-05-26 08:54:59
She doesn't land him HA HA HA
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:12:01
I can feel the sidelines getting HOT
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:52:29
Still working?..
@_date: 2018-05-26 06:53:00
P.S.: he wears glasses, that's also a successful slavery tool widely used.
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:12:29
When you will forget about it
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:54:32
If BTC were a religion, BTC as a God would try to reach its people cognitively through pain and say: don't fucking listen to gurus, don't get manipulated, don't rush into good words, don't get incertitude about your "feelings", no one knows my future implications, not even myself. :OO -The god of all cryptos-
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:41:25
A society of chaos is much better than one stuck in linear (unnoticed/injected) habits that are keeping people at their basic existence level rofl
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:51:51
We're still here :*
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:09:32
I think you just felt for a lame troll post lmao
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:08:54
Where did you see that 1k exactly?
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:49:03
Can't stand smokers smoking in front of someone who is not. Before being aware and conscious and so on, you need some level of self-control xDD
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:42:51
To nullify your first action, not to double it lmao
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:22:19
Just found out purple is the color of ambition lol
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:52:59
@_date: 2018-05-29 18:32:50
LOL Italy could give up with Euro and apply BTC xDD
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:36:17
Years are a myth
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:12:52
Ban who asks for ban please
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:26:14
Condolences everyone
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:40:27
The last rally looked like an attempt to create panic sell. A weak one tho.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:05:05
Pssh, don't talk like that about BTC religion
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:32:44
Where did they say that
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:36:41
So, what does it mean? Up or down?
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:38:51
I always read when they end but never when thy start
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:38:59
Keep on the topic
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:17:16
You did well. That "you're" always triggers me too
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:40:29
I think you're taking the wrong pills
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:34:26
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:53:58
Anyone so medicated you don't know what is human anymore
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:07:53
What's your reference?
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:51:20
Cryptically bored
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:24:38
That means nothing. The facts they left an half job that is still in need to be completed and not yet decently implementable after 10 years are a better topic for your accusations xD
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:01:51
This is what a passive investor may think lmao
@_date: 2018-05-29 06:32:59
To the mooooon
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:11:17
He prolly actually hopes for 12k at max
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:59:38
HE SCREAMING
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:01:28
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:20:46
Is idiocity the root of desperation?
