It's actually not the price on the orange graph, it's the volume. 
Here is a graph for **Comments (MA3)/BTC Price**: [

I couldn't find any daily discussion threads dating back further than early December. I did a chart for BTC Price/Comments, but the correlation wasn't nearly as strong as for the volume.

The correlation between trading volume and daily discussion posts is much stronger compared to BTC price moving in either direction.

\^ This is a very valid point. There are a couple of differences between how a bank works today and bitcoin. Storing your money in a bank is currently considered safe as an ATM only can withdraw a limited amount of money per day. The bank is also likely to reimburse you if this would happen (the same way they do with credit card fraud). They take the cost of your lost money but get goodwill back. Also, as these scenarios only can withdraw a limited amount of money, it's not a big expense to cover for the banks.
If a robber would keep you hostage, and force you to transfer money via your online bank (and this happens on occasion), the money is almost always found as it's easy to follow the paper trail of where the money ended up. In this scenario, large amounts of cash cannot really be withdrawn from Forex or similar, and the total loss, if any, is usually below $10.000 for the bank. 
When it comes to Bitcoin, these hostage situations would become more beneficial to the criminal. Obtaining your private would in theory give them access to all your private wealth, without any way of getting it back. There is nothing to protect you. 
Also, storing your private key in a bank is an oxymoron, as you would give the control back to the bank (giving them an opportunity to seize your money at will). However, this might be the best way of keeping your money safe, but it still wont protect you from a hostage situation with one of your family members. Cryptocurrency kidnappings are happening today (google it), and with more adoption of Bitcoin, it's likely that this problem would become more frequent.

No, they don't.  Source: [
