I suspect it’s closer to the 30-50% mark lost from the early days.

Sell it and buy a trezor, Nano, or keepkey..

Difficulty could go back down. Fees are based loosely based on the number of unconfirmed bitcoin transactions (  ) The more a person is willing to spend to transfer bitcoin the more likely it gets picked up in the next block..

I think the problem will be with attempting to flood the market to drop the price. Eventually the bitcoin will end up spread out amongst people buying at the dip. In the long run the only thing whales can do is try to buy to inflate the price.

This probably isn’t the group of people you should ask that question to as you will always get a yes. Try personal finance or the fire (financial independence retire early ) sub Reddit’s

Boo! I they should have closed out with predicting 10k....
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:51:42
If you’ve bought bitcoin over the last 3 years yes. BCash hard forked around 3 months ago Bgold hard forked about a month ago. If you have your private keys you can split them out ( if u are using trezor they have split tools )

Dont forget about Bitcoin Cash &amp; Gold...
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:15:22
Why not just do recovery on your Ledger V/S transferring BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:06:56
Or BGold!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:13:30
I believe both Trezor and Nano ship worldwide.. Check them out. ( FYI Trezor is more user friendly. Nano supports more coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:26:05
Hahah well to be fair anyone with like 1.5 bitcoin pulled in 5 figures over the last year.

If ya don’t write down your private key a solar flare could easily wipe you out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:17
No.. some people hold more. Like me Satoshi holds 1,000,000 in a single address.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:24:31
Hahah I wish.. Satoshi ( The creator of Bitcoin ) does ( If he didn't lose the passphrase ).

Read the following

My favorite is if you think that is a problem wait until you see the governments solution!
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:37:43
I almost think there's a 3rd group.. Those who were lucky enough to get bitcoin on the cheap ( Gift from friend / family )  and still have the private keys... 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:37:32
My guess would be aging infrastructure .

One of the biggest factors for mining bitcoin is the cost of your electricity. AKA if your not on extremely cheep electric you will probably lose money in the mining process v/s purchasing your bitcoin.

I was around for the finger era :). That one totally slipped my mind!
@_date: 2019-10-03 01:41:45
Its an interesting question really. It quite possibly would have tanked crypto currencies due to supply / demand issues with a single person holding a large chunk early on. Realistically the price would have started inflating as you purchased since you wouldn't be able to buy it all from one source.. You could probably have gotten a good 10k from $1000 as you inflated the price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:20:39
By using something like the Gold or Silver Standard.. Funny enough the USD used to be on the Gold Standard until 1933 and completely abandoned it in 1971.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:52:19
Bah just get a pet implant that’s encoded with your private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:46:40
Probably closer to the 18M / 17M club.. I'd bet there are a good 2-3M lost bitcoin besides satoshi's..
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:16:10
Bitcoin actually is limited. The algorithm eventually stops giving bitcoin as rewards for mining blocks, eventually just the user fees ( transferring btc) will pay the miners.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:49:30
Next dip scheduled at 10k ... dip price is set to 8500...

Lol the guy who had surgery to remove his testicles. They weighed 200 lbs! ( google it... warning NSFW ) 
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:18:21
Have they let people access their bitcoin cash yet? I moved everything out before that fork.... 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:00:51
Option 1: Don't send 2X coins after the split. ( Assume everything is on the primary BTC chain ) This will protect you from people doing replay on the primary BTC chain with the 2X transfer. Theycould use the BTC transfer to take your 2X coins however.
Option 2: Send 2X coins to another address you control. Send BTC to a 3rd address you control. ( Splitting the 2X and BTC to seperate addresses ) 
Option 3: Hold until things have settled down. ( Until a split tool is released or 2X is dead. )

Your argument is flawed in this scenario. There were assets that are in question the government admitted were not involved in a crime. 
In this scenario the thief  was to say I want to sell my motor cycle, here is the proof I worked a job, used funds from that job and paid off the motor cycle and the government saying you cant sell it to pay for your defense.
