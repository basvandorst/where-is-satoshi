what's the best way to tumble bitcoin so that no one will know who bought it? I have to buy with KYC so I need to go from there. 
My example plan is:   
1. buy $250 of btc (~0.025 btc) on KYC exchange  
2. buy monero (=2.38XMR)   
3. withdraw monero on non KYC'd binance account (=2.3799XMR after fees)  
4. sell for bitcoin(~0.0248)   
5. withdraw bitcoin to personal wallet  (=0.0243 after 0.0005 withdraw fee on binance)
Is there any better way?

Some block explorers have tagged addresses already. Like "binance hot wallet" etc. I think this practice will happen more and more in the future. I can see block explorers tagging more  addresses in the future. some examples: 
"amazon wallet"
" some casino sites wallet "
" wikileaks donation wallet"
Then we're right back to the start with people saying "why are you donating to wikileaks, dont you know they're supporting trump?"
"so you're a gambling addict huh?" 
etc. etc.

I dont want to launder money... 
How can bitcoin be anonymous if I need to submit my passport to buy it? 
If I have a business and accept bitcoin everyone who pays with BTC can see my bitcoin balance and I don't want this. I just want to have bitcoin without the whole world knowing how much I own.

Isn't a big point of bitcoin that it's anonymous? Where is that anonymity if I need to submit my documents everywhere? Some random kraken employee can see everything I buy using BTC right now. What if goverments force exchanges to make that stuff public? Like kraken can see John Smith bought 1btc on their platform and see all the adresses he sent it to. That defeats a big point of bitcoin don't you think?

So these people are all just lucky then?  
   
  
This is on bitmex where theres only a couple of shitcoins one can trade (only btc deposits) so its not like they bought a random ico and got lucky
