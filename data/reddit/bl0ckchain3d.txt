You're over-thinking... this is just someone making a buck off the name. Nobody is going to associate Bitcoin with candy or Walmart and if they do they shouldn't be in it to begin with ;)

I agree somewhat however, currencies usually are not just passing fads. Don't quote me on this but I think gold/ silver was just as volatile when it first became valuable. There are a lot of cryptos out there that are going to sink however, blockchain technology is going to be a revolutionary technology in our near future. That is why my money is on crytpo. Which.. crypto is the million dollar question (quite literally). IMO I think government will be the biggest threat to the future of cryptocurrency because of the decentralization  factor. I think that's one reason why it is taking so long for regulations to set in.

Everything is going digital, what are you talking about? Crypto is the beginning of something great, mark my words. Beanie babies SMH wow. Where is Blockbuster video anymore? Or even CD's? What happened to a lot of stores you used to see as a child (assuming you're an adult). Digital! Everything is changing to easier, cheaper and faster alternatives. This is only the beginning.
