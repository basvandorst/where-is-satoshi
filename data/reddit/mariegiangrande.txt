I hear your perspective... control is indeed the bottom line. What is attractive about bitcoin is not its price or investment value, it is that the new ‘open consensus algorithms ‘ -can- provide tremendous efficiencies to all marketplaces and every economy.    
The actual instability of the value is a detriment. But it is a unavoidable consequence of  imperfect information circulating around developing markets.

Yes indeed : “short term price perspective is useless in the eye of an economic revolution”

The evolutionary path of markets is very hard to predict,but we are on the right path.

Interesting ... ‘opt-in’.  I think that could work... Public bitcoin exchanges should offer full transparency to all transactions, an audit trail and a consolidated order book/ price feed.  A nice side benefit if we just allow opt in to an open trail.

Does Lightening Networks have a self generating audit trail?  Why not layer in a reporting/ recording network for public consumption?

 Crypto-instruments collapse dozens of tasks across multiple firms into a network and a wallet with analytics. This may seem scary for some, but for others it’s an opportunity. Simplified workflows allow firms to pursue new linkages between industries and find ‘low-friction’ entry points into new markets. 
Satoshi’s invention, manifested by bitcoin, will forever change financial business models.  Not many firms will make it through the transition, but it’s nice to see a few incumbents take a lead in *Crypto*\-Capital Markets.  The race is *on*.
