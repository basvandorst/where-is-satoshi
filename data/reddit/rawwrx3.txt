you realize the mining is necessary to keep the system running? Without the mining effort you cannot transfer bitcoins safely. Compare it to the running costs a normal currency creates.

It has too many flaws for my taste. It's an interesting concept and i like watching how it progresses.

who is this kid? 1.300 followers?
All his posts are crappy wisdom sentences. Half of them with mistakes.
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:04:40


which all are not trustworthy, because they play their own little games.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:16:04

@_date: 2014-10-08 18:55:07


terfeiting difficult, as simple weight and

@_date: 2014-12-29 22:01:45
no it doesn't.
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:03:27
yeah his comment is bullshit. One does not need to understand how bitcoins work. It boils down to: Do you believe that a free virtual currency has the potential to become a viable widespread currency?
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:14:47
How do people find these weakspots? Do they review code all day long?
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:03:42
well he studied economics... Don't expect him to be very bright in his head.
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:04:41
which makes it even worse, because he was able to pull it of without even knowing what he was doing.
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:15:04
doesnt that kinda prove his point? He has no viable connections what so ever.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:20:01

how about:
1. invent time machine
2. go back in time and explain time machine
3. have time machine without having to invent it.

if i would die during an everest trip i would prefer to stay there. Besides it's not like hundreds of people die there every year. And ruining the mountain.
Its kind of an honor thing imo. They died trying. At least those who climb the mountain can give them some respect and be reminded that its not a fun trip. 
Plastic and dirt is another story :/

nah. helis can reach the top.
On May 14, 2005, at 07:08 NPT in the early morning (01:23 UTC), Delsalle set the world record for highest altitude landing of a helicopter when his Eurocopter AS350 Squirrel touched down on the highest point of land on earth, the 8,848 m (29,030 ft) summit of Mount Everest.

@_date: 2015-02-02 22:12:15

@_date: 2015-03-23 06:15:03
actually they do. 
On 29 April 2010, a stripped-down AS350 B3 succeeded in rescuing three alpinists from Annapurna I, Nepal, at 8,091 metres, one at a time, the highest such rescue.

he was paid better than in the time span. That's obviously stealing

In February 2014, Antonopoulos mistakenly tweeted about software that turned out to be bitcoin stealing malware.[46]
Later in August, Antonopoulos was criticized by a Reddit user who reported a security vulnerability and perceived it as critical, that it was left unfixed for almost a month.[47]
