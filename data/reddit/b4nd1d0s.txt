how do you know how many inputs and outputs do you have ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:00:16
NO, because Bitcoin is slowest with highest fees coin on market. BTC has his own value only because of altcoins which you can buy only with bitcoins. when someday you could buy all altcoins with ETH or USD, bitcoin will fall down to 0

If really Ver stand behind this, you have to know that he make millions with that move.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:57:48
a small group of people manipulated bitcoin and with that move they earned millions dollars.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:46:54

@_date: 2017-11-10 20:42:20
ofc, all miners went to bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:44:59
problem is not coinbase, but you, because you start with crypto on first site on google search, you should read a bit about witch site is good and witch not first ??, you came to official shittiest exchange site ever. like 95% bad reviews about coinbase. as a "wallet" to send and receive smal amounts btc is good, but bad for buying and selling with credit cards/banks and support is super bad... extremely bad
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:48
its currently pay rate for miners, 63% in compare to Bitcoin (100%). This was like 300%+ 24h ago, so all miners went to bitcoin cash...
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:38:33
one month ago was 5000, did you cry back then why is 5000 when it came from 2000 up to 5000 ??
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:51:21
Can someone explain me why everyone says that bitcoin has no "third party fees"... BUT if i pay trough bank for some product 100$, i will pay like 0.5c bank transaction fee... BUT if i pay with bitcoin, i will pay like 0.0005btc = cca 3$ reward for miners... So can someone explain me WHERE everyone see that bitcoin transactions are cheaper than bank transactions ?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:34:47
why are you sending 0.00008851 BTC at all lmao ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:44:03
get out from shitbase asap
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:02:51
thank you for explaining
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:26:24
agree... sad... but in reality that way is the birth of billionaires
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:46:32
"panic" in one word
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:23:45
What is LN ?
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:03:43
if you will get money... why leaving ? than you will have same problems with selling on coinbase hahahah and waiting 1 month to withdraw. if you get those 25k, just move to another wallet and start what you wanted to do with those 25k...
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:23:42
there is 125000 unconfirmed transactions right now, so with 3$ fee i think you will wait a long time.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:52:42
every day someone says "not lower than (12k, 11k, 10k, 9k, 8k) $7,000"... what you will say in a few days when price will be below 7k ?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:02:31
ofc visa and MC will eventually banned crypto because crypto is their competitive player
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:18:51
and you believe news from site with 100 daily unique visitors with 190 daily pageviews ?? good lord, thats why everyone panic
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:56:57
I think coinbase will work this time, i read their FAQ about Segwit2x and they sayed this: "No action is required on your part. All Coinbase users with a BTC balance at the time of the fork will automatically be credited with an equal balance of B2X. "
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:06:01
I read that after fork you get same amount coins of new coin. Is this true ? and if you have bitcoins on wallet from walletgenerator.net which you created for Bitcoin currency, than where (on which wallet) will you get new coins? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:24:39
Was like that with bitcoin cash too ?
