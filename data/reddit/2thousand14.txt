I used that one as well. I wouldn't call it terrible by any means, it was just a pain in the ass and for someone who hadn't used one before, it was kind of confusing. All in all, I was out within 15 minutes gambling with 2 bitcoin. I would prefer a more anonymous way to do things though.

I don't think so... He says "show you around *my* city" which comes off to me as something prickish to say. Why not, I'll show you around town; the city; vegas; etc. I have lived in Detroit, Orlando, and Nashville. Never once did I call it my city as if I owned the place.

Or you could just stop bitching and go work for Uber!

Yes... people go to ice skate in the winter, and not one building surrounding it is vacant. In fact, it's hard to find a place to rent because of the demand currently. It's not unsustainable at all. You are ignorant and a fucktard for spreading mis-information about a city that is in a turn around phase. Just ask anyone that does the [slow roll]( every monday if it looks like downtown isn't vibrant and full of business. Now kindly fuck off, and don't respond, because I know that nothing you say will be based on fact.

I fixed it for you since there was nitpickery. Now, you should be all set.
