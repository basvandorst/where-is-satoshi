Just seeing this now. What an awesome account. I'm literally sitting here at my laptop tearing up seeing the joy that our donations brought him. It's really amazing when you can change someone's life profoundly for the better who is so deserved. And my favorite part? "Are you sitting down?" I sit down. ;-) Let's keep fighting to support those in our community who speak so eloquently for the whole.

I don't see a donation address anywhere on the site. Am I missing it?

Fiat currency is basically a monetary instrument that isn't back by 
anything, like gold. (The USD used to be backed by gold until Nixon took us off that in the 70's)
In this case, Tether is *supposed* to be backed 1:1 by USD. But if you've been following what's going on with Tether/Binfinex recently, it's pretty clear that this 1:1 backing probably isn't happening. Tether's can be created at will, much like USD's can be printed at will by the Treasury. And they have been, to the tune of 1B USD and counting.

I've actually given quite a bit more to DDWB and a number of other charities. Trust me that all my crypto will be given away at some point or another.
