You pay CGT on profit from trading fiat currencies, why not bitcoin?

Be careful, I believe CC companies will see investing as a cash advance, and you’ll be charged a huge amount of interest if they do.

For me this is just proof people look for every single source of hope that bitcoin is going to moon, despite it actually being reliable or just complete horse shit.
Look at halving cycles, not years. I could easily say "OOH 9 years ago BTC was at $0.07, bad holiday season ahead boys."

Pretty much everyone on this sub is so overly bullish about bitcoin, they will always tell you to buy, no matter what the price or state of market is.

The way I see it right now, is it can fall into either category of stock or currency. 
As it’s still being developed and adopted by society, it could still go either way depending on whether it eventually eliminates fiats or not. 
Because of this sort of uncertainty, I’m guessing everyone is in limbo and just has different opinions on what should be done, and right now no one is really incorrect as this piece of technology still has a long way to go before it’s fully adopted by the world.

Anyone notice on CoinBase they show the price $200-$400 higher than what it actually is? At least on the regular version anyway.

Could the development of quantum computing alter this date?

that sounds beautiful

No one does. This subreddit is just people trying to keep the image of bitcoin positive so people like the OP don’t sell out and make things worse. 
No one knows, there is the potential for this to be huge, but there is also the chance that it wont be.

You get capital gains tax if you break the profit thresholds of trading between fiats don’t you?
@_date: 2019-12-18 11:00:32
*not yet.*
It has the potential, but there are more hurdles.
As the guy said above who then contradicted himself:


No one knows. No one is from the future. Everything ahead is pure speculation and opinion until it actually happens and goes down in history.

What trends?

All exchanges will have to collect all user info and pass it on to HMRC, IRS etc, so the governing bodies know how much you earn, your trading frequency etc.

BUY ON COINBASE PRO AT LEAST, NOTTT REGULAR COINBASE.

I mean you fit the crystal ball stereotype perfectly “Bitcoin is here to stay, see you in 2022” 
Just stop. No one knows.
