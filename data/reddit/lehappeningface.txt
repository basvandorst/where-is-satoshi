If you're in the USA  lets you hook up your bank account to buy bitcoins. It is supposed to be similar to paypal in terms of usability and even has its own built in wallet!

Direct Withdrawal (from your bank account)

There is something called "Cryptocurrency". Which means any currency which has particular properties. Litecoin and Bitcoin are two versions of the same idea. Similar to how linux and mac are both versions of the idea of an operating system. Litecoin is like bitcoin but has different properties. For example litecoin uses a mining algorithm which is doesn't have as much of a difference between the different mining technologies (ie a cpu might mine bitcoin 1000 times slower than a gpu but in the same case mining litecoin may only be 10 times slower) Aditionally litecoin has a faster targeted confirmation time where it produces 4 blocks for every one bitcoin block therby making transactions with atleast some certainty quicker.

The refrence implementation might never be user friendly because of it's needing to download the full blockchain (atleast in archive mode). Clients like electrum and multbit offer the advantages of a web client (fast set up, small hard drive space requirment) and some of the advantages of a full client (no need for a central server).

@_date: 2013-03-25 20:15:03
One really important one is that some companies don't accept credit card payments from certain countires because or rampant chargebacks. The guys behind stomp romp said this.
Another reason is that some countries can't use paypal stuff. That is one of the reasons wordpress accepts bitcoins. It is terrible that some people are kept out of the internet lop without bitcoins!

Firstly all the Humble *Indie* Bundles are playable on Mac Windows and Linux (and sometimes even android) it is only the occasional non indie bundle that doesn't have to support those Linux and Mac. Secondly where do you get the information that bitcoin users paid the least? Didn't Humble Bundle say specifically that Bitcoin users where more generous about the payments despite there not being many bitcoin purchases?

But what is the actual point of either of those new things? Innovating means making new *useful* things. Both of those seem like they are just fluff.

I'd just like to inteject a moment.... What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

The things they sell have been getting steadily more trendy and less "geeky" if you want proof just search for linux related stuff and then search for stuff from some random trendy tv show or movie and observe the difference.

I would consider myself a Liberal, small government, less taxes, no non defensive wars, free private lives and getting the money out of politics by getting the politics out of money are my concerns.

I believe you should be able to spend your money however you want. Just the only way to prevent people bribing politicians is to make it so politicans can't just pay back the wealthy interests that put them in power by giving them government support to squash their competitors. There would be no reason to donate so much money if not for the fact that in many countries if not all politicians can basically destroy legitemet business if they feel it is in their best interest. This should be particualarily apparent in the case of bitcoin where in the US a lot of the big players in getting politicians elected are large banks. If bitcoin gets regulated into the dirt it is no doubt because the funders of the major politicians wanted it so.
Im actually a bit confused about the whole libretarian thing. I think maybe the definitions are different for many countries but I would take libretarian to mean an anarchist. That is what most of the libretarian views I see seem to indicate. 
Maybe an easier way to differentiate this is by asking people to identify based on ideas rather than labels. For example know for a fact that Liberal means a social democrat in the modern USA but for many years in the USA and elsewhere even to this day Liberal means a very particular thing dealing with efficient government, the lack of social class and the free market. So maybe if you ask people to take a political quiz this would be easier or even if you described the terms. ie
which best describes your politics:
1[ ] limited government controll of monetary and social issues.
2[ ]limited government controll of monetary issues, goverment controll of social issues
3[ ] government controll of government controll of monetary issues, limited controll of social issues
4[ ] goverment controll of monetary and social issues
5[ ] No/extremely small government
