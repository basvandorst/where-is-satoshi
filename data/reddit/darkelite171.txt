I would agree in the sense that you don’t have as many people lining up to buy at those high prices. Maybe they never existed. It doesn’t take many to inflate a price. In fact all you need is one buyer and one seller to make a transaction at a given price.

What’s going to happen next I hope is that these smart fellas making the crypto currencies take some time to answer some very real challenges facing them. They have a great concept with clearly a lot of demand, but 
some of their biggest competitors are going to be governments (USD,EUR,GBP who have an economic incentive to restrict alternative currencies), 
security remains an issue (hackings, thefts),
extreme volatility makes medium of exchange difficult (ref Steam), 
lengthy and expensive transactions.
The crypto market in its current form is more of a prototype. It’s got a lot of people’s attention right now. Question is how are they gonna make it better. They address even a few of these issues and you’ll see this market hit new highs.

Think about it like this. Let’s say I have a basket of 10 bananas. I manage to convince one of you to buy one banana from me at $1. Now the basket is presumed to be equal to the purchase price of the last banana transaction times the number of bananas in my market. So all of these bananas are worth ($1x10 bananas) $10 in total. I then convince another one of you to buy a banana for $19,000. Well based on the last price the market for the basket just went up to $190,000. The problem is there is no depth to this market so if the first guy goes to sell his banana for $19,000 but can’t find anyone and the best he can do is sell it for $1, then the market will collapse back down to $10.

These are really good bananas

Yes of course. My example assumed my bananas were special and finite. The low numbers just served to simplify a multi billion dollar market. But remember a few players DO have a major share in the crypto market so their moves can certainly have a significant impact on price.
