Now somebody needs to analyze the writing styles of mark karpeles and DPR to settle this. Although karpeles isn't very good at speaking English so I imagine he's not very good at writing it either.

Many south american countries with large populations like Argentina and Venezuela have dealt with many issues of currency devaluation so they are likely more receptive. There is also some historical precedence of massive currency devaluation dating back to the influx of gold to the Iberian peninsula from the Americas during the 1400's.

I imagine once it grows in use that ads would be a good way to finance the pot

Fat chance. People say a lot of things when they campaign. These things tend to never materialize once they reach office. Especially when your in line to receive billions of euros in central bank stimulus. It is nice to dream though.

As long as both options are made available to the user I don't see how there's a problem. The Coinbase payment option allows the user to receive the benefits of both centralized and decentralized systems at the same time in this situation.

I think it stopped paying out for a while because someone figured out a way to game the system yesterday but I guess it is back up and running from the looks of it

You also have to take into account btc current supply rate increase of approximately 10% annually as well.

China didn't ban bitcoin they only banned banks and payment processors from handling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:27:37
Forget paradigm shift. Just know that two immediate benefits will be discounts that merchants like uber will give due to their lower processing fees and also the ability for you to pay without handing over your personal info to be stored in a potentially faulty system for everyone to feast their eyes on at a future date. Those are two that immediately come to mind but will eventually seem meager in the potential benefits of programmable money.

"According to Wulkan and others at S2T, Abu-Mustafa’s group left a Bitcoin account number showing that it managed to raise five Bitcoin, worth approximately, at the time, $1,000 dollars. The account, says Wulkan, has since been seized and shut down by the FBI."
Bitcoin account number? Seized and shutdown? This kind of fear inducing headline and blatant misunderstanding of how bitcoin works truly makes me question the author's intentions in writing this article. Or the intentions of those that requested it be written. 
Best case scenario is you can chalk it up to yet another case of ethically challenged journalistic negligence looking for as many page views as possible.

The processing fees are actually much more than that to the merchant and these costs actually do make their way to consumers in terms of higher pricing. In many cases you need to include the cost of chargebacks as well as the cost of preventing chargebacks in the form of a fraud department which adds a significant burden on processing costs. These costs can be significantly reduced with the type of payment that bitcoin makes. Also, the merchants receive their payment immediately instead of days later, effectively giving them more money through the concept of present value. These savings can and will be passed onto consumers.


These benefits will develop rapidly as the technology progresses, but conceptually you can think of payments being made with contracts embedded within them, such as lets say you give somebody money to complete a task, and if they do not do so in accordance with the contractual obligations that money will be returned, removing the need to pay for a third party mediating the transaction. Think escrow services like title companies in real estate transactions.


You might say that right now but I can guarantee if you were somebody that has had their identity stolen or has to deal with constant fraud attempts you would not be saying that. Also, consider that with the advent of big data you might possibly be one of those people that won't want to have your purchasing habits constantly being categorized and analyzed to be used to advertise to you at a future date, although that just might be me.


That's fine, many people instinctively treat criticism as an attack and that's what usually yields the sometimes poor discussion you see in this forum.

Welcome to the internet. You're going to find some people who pay for content and some who don't. That's not exclusive to this subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:41:12
You will likely find questionable content on any media site. Like the OP said, the site has a contrarian line of thinking so it requires a bit of an open mind. Learn to take the good with the bad and verify what you can.
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:47:56
I'm not trying to sell anything. I was just trying to answer the OP's question in the best way I could. Bitcoin is volatile now but some people think it will be less volatile in the future as use grows. Those were the people I was referencing in my answer to his question and that's where I believe their interest stems. I am not sure who you are speaking about when you say "their currency".
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:17:10

If they can eliminate the counterparty risk of using their platform then count me in. If they can not, I will continue to hold my bitcoins in their current state.

while that might be the average overall per user I think the more active users would reflect significantly higher amounts, and there's no better way to promote active users than monetary incentives like this

Circle is just slightly cheaper than coinbase for buying bitcoins but coinbase has a vault which is useful for preventing your coins from being stolen. For those who are hesitant to undergo the process of securing their private keys themselves coinbase's vault is probably the best option at the moment

Sounds like you got some good ideas hope you get enough users to make it work, although it seems like it will be difficult trying to find users from a niche audience within a niche audience. Maybe you should combine forces with this twin you speak of

I didn't say it was good or bad exposure. That's up for the investor to decide, but it does provide added choice for retail investors in an area with currently few options in that regard. FIG would probably be a safer option but I'm sure there's a couple others.

Btcs is actually currently one of the only ways to get some relative exposure to bitcoin in the us stock market. They've invested in gocoin and some other bitcoin companies as well I think so it let's the average non accredited investor get some exposure to those private companies should they desire. Not sure if they directly hold any bitcoin though.
