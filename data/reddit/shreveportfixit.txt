I disagree.  Most alts are garbage, but some will have utility down the road.  It's silly to believe that the original blockchain will be the only one that ever has value.

@_date: 2019-07-17 16:44:11
No, see, cause BCH forked BACK to the original chain so it wasn't really a fork at all, while BTC artificially imposed smaller blocks, thus forking without forking.

They handle more TXpS than the BTC base layer.  Second layers like Lightning Network and BAKKT can handle more transactions by orders of magnitude.  But if thats the only metric you're looking at then I'm afraid you're missing the point entirely.  
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:24:44
AFAIK naked shorting will be impossible with BTC
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:29:10
But like I said, txps is not as important as a decentralized platform that is open to innovation from devs.  Smart contracts are going to revolutionize supply chain and the public ledger will make government patents obsolete.  About 90% of all government functions can be turned into apps.  This is fucking BIG.

Technically, Bitcoin is private.  No tax funds are used for it.  All miners are for-profit businesses, all nodes are volunteers.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:35:00
I think the main reason Bitcoin is seen as secure is that miners have been securing it since 2009.  It would be much harder to spoof or double spend Bitcoin than some new untested cryptocurrency issued by a central authority.  The trust is where BTC gets its value. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 07:33:56
Bits that have been known to be used for illegal purposes, or known to have been stolen.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:45:10
So, you want demand for Bitcoin to stay low?  And this benefits you how?
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:48:36
Depends on the merchant.  I only guy goods locally from people who believe in Bitcoins long-term value.  It adds to the economy, and any BTC i spend gets replenished.

No.  That is not what "premined" means.  At all.  It is, by definition, a restriction on distribution because one party starts with a huge amount of coins without doing any work.  Do more research, you do not understand this topic.

You can start mining bitcoin in 2140 and will receive transaction fees as a reward.  You need to read more and talk less.
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:03:24
It means the dev codes his currency in such a way that they start the blockchain with a ton of coins before anyone else has a chance to start mining.  It's pretty basic and everyone here seems to get it, except for you.

Look at it this way:  12.5 BTC  are mined every 10 minutes.  That means in order for the price to remain stable at $9,000 that $16,875,000 new dollars have to traded for Bitcoin EVERY DAY.  That's substantial.

The whole point of Bitcoin is you don't need someone else to hold your money.  like with banks, exchanges can be robbed but unlike banks you will never get your money back.  Your money is safer on a mobile  or desktop wallet with a PIN code enabled than on a central exchange.
If you don't hold the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoin.

Every tx is visible, but irreversible.  If an attacker gets your private keys he can transfer control of your coins to another bitcoin address that he alone has the private keys to.

Andreas has talked positively about SegWit and Lightning network many times.  He just understands that Bitcoin is free, and people will disagree and compete in a free market. Big blockers have their scaling  solution, core has theirs.  Neither will completely destroy the other.  Look how many distros of Linux exist.  Which one is the one true Linux?  Whichever one fits your needs.  If one coin fits more people's needs then it will have a greater market value.

It's all about public interest.  Right now people don't give a shit about bitcoin.  People I have talked to about BTC  sneeringly asked "So did you get out before the crash lol?" The public saw a 60% drop and assume it's dead.  Let the price linger for a couple years, then people will forget, more positive stories in the media than negative ones, and the price slowly creeps up.  As soon as it touches the previous ATH of $20k, it will shoot to $200k in an instant.  Then immediately crash back to $80k, and the cycle will continue.

Also, no reputable coder is refuting what's in the source.  So there is literally no reason not to trust them.  But if you still don't you are free to read the source and compile your own node / wallet / mining software, plenty of people have.

Lnd requires go and a full bitcoin node running on a linux box.  It took me a solid weekend of tinkering to get my node up and running.  Never did send and funds to open a channel though.

So its still secure and recorded onchain, yet is more anonymous? 
And to say that 128 or 256 or 512mb blocks (as will be needed) won't centralize nodes, well THAT'S delirious.

An economy built on debt requires pertetual growth or it will collapse.  Without interference from the government or central banks an economy should go through natural cycles of inflation and deflation.

I don't care about 2013, i care about 2113.  We're taking on Visa, paper checks, and cash, we need tens of thouands of transactions per second.  How does bcash propose to handle that?  1tb blocks?
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:17:34
Sounds like you should read more about lightning.  
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:16:33
All tansactions are cryptographically secure and are settled on the blockchain, but LN is a second layer.  Unlike Bcash, where there is a permanent record when you buy a pack of gum, and only handles a paltry few hundred transactions per second.  Also bcash's huge blocksizes make nodes centralized, basically bcash is banks 2.0

Yes, thank you.  Speculation may be Bitcoin's killer app, but no one wants to invest in something that can lose 90% of its value in a day.  I think $2200 is a great stable price for right now.

There aren't many places to spend BTC yet.  I run an IT consulting / computer repair company, and we accept it, as does Buku Vapor, but most people around here that own Bitcoin are hodlers and would rather spend fiat.
I have bought some vape stuff with BTC though.
