So can OP verify if you got your 2% cash back? This would be a boon for hoarding points/travel hacking.

It won't let me download through that link.

That is a great book when it comes to a wealth building mindset. Definitely required reading.

I'm at a Chinese restaurant. She said, "Never trade Bitcoin, onry hodl."
@_date: 2014-06-28 02:48:50
Where did she get it?
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:09:46
This is assuming that the number of transactions and associated fees isn't enough to keep rising the demand for mining. If Bitcoin moves towards a world currency than that number of transactions will rise exponentially, and I think will make up for the loss in mining rewards.

Seriously that's a great song.
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:54:22
I love Hardcore History! There are a handful of lectures Bitcoin or not, that are so good I listen to them periodically.

Here is the recording of the interview if you missed it:
That was great.
Matt Miller (Bloomberg reporter guy) really is all for bitcoin, he definitely gets it.
Barry Silbert has me all excited: "We're kind of at the inflection point where we are going to see some real institutional money move into the space."
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:35:02
Dude he is on point.
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:50:07
The mining always goes towards equilibrium, no matter how efficient the devices. So the energy cost will always be the same as the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:58:33
Why? Certainly they can get their previous one updated as necessary in a matter if days.
@_date: 2014-07-12 09:11:02
haha I love Whose Line is it Anyways.

That would be one hell of a way to smuggle money out of the country.
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:20:00
I'm thinking the same thing. First get people used to the idea of being taxed this way. Then raise it, and raise it again. A generation later "this is just how it's done".
@_date: 2014-06-27 06:12:34
Yes it should
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:28:09
Good to know. That was my first concern as well.
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:58:31
Ha BUT BUT decentralized!
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:19:24
Thank you for your thorough reply. I really do appreciate clarifying the various libertarian perspectives. The abortion issue has always been one that I didn't understand, and now I definitely can understand how someone can hold those views.
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:09:25
Dude thanks! 2 cents
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:58:07
Yea Fireflies is a sweet idea.

Great! I'm glad someone finally made it happen. Now get one up here in Phoenix so I don't have to drive! :)

I'll buy some Lollyphille pops so fast with that free $10.

I always have the Gyft card pulled up and ready to go before I'm in line. Usually I check the balance beforehand anyways, and top off if I need to.
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:56:56
That's what held me back. Maybe I'll aim to swing trade with 25-50% so I don't "miss the boat".
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:17:35
They may have market share, but OpenBazaar has no fees. No Paypal, No seller fees, sounds fantastic!
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:14:40
Now you are trying to force me think your way. How interesting that you can't have it both ways.
If a man is beating his wife in public, should anyone step in to help her?
If I believe at some point in the pregnancy a fetus is defenseless and deserving of defense, then that would effect how I view policy surrounding the issue. This doesn't mean I don't care about women's rights or personal liberty. It's a discussion of whose liberty comes first. This is the quandary. 
Obviously this discussion could go in circles to the point that it's not worth engaging in, and has been engaged in for all of time. The discussion I'm having with honestly helped me form an understanding of how people come to their moral conclusion. Yours however, contributes absolutely nothing to the discussion. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:59:44
Well yea, I buy a new card. I just make sure I have enough in there before I get in line.

At this point, I'm considering selling my mom to buy some cheap coin for the next surge.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:34:27
Cool, looking forward to playing with it.
@_date: 2014-07-12 00:51:47
Put more in bitcoin, buy a rental property, open a Roth IRA and get some growth stock mutual funds. Google it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:33:50
Ha good observation. All buy pressure, no sell pressure with these guys!
@_date: 2014-07-13 19:06:10
Day trading is definitely not for most. Do you trade the large swings? I wanted to sell at $1000+ and held myself back.
@_date: 2014-07-12 08:23:45
This is a gold mine.

Dude where do you live? 60 years ago i'm pretty sure my neighborhood at least had running water.

Barry wasn't telling us he won; he was announcing the 6pm ending of the auction.

I thought yolohash was something else.
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:46:25
I'm thinking anything people are mining with today will be nearly irrelevant in power by then anyways. Also, as the number of transactions rises miners will also be receiving larger transaction fees in each block. This should account for at least some of the difference.
@_date: 2014-07-14 22:23:38
Ha speaking to their people. That's my dad's language.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:36:34
Seriously. I know I'm asking for the downvote brigade here but I just didn't want to give up my iOS/OSX ecosystem. I was considering it. Glad to be over this hump.
@_date: 2014-07-12 18:04:24
I consider myself a libertarian, and agree with the philosophical approach almost entirely across the board. I still don't understand how a philosophy that allows pretty much any action as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else is okay with abortion. Do libertarians really believe that a fetus deserves no rights? I can understand the view coming from a Darwinistic view, but not as a cause-no-harm libertarian.
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:55:26
I've dabbled in nootropics and use MyModafinil.net which also takes Bitcoin. I might switch it up to try something new.
@_date: 2014-07-06 05:55:07
Ha I do the uncle thing too. I've told friends Rob Dyrdek is funny on TV but would be the worst uncle.

I didnt want it two weeks ago but now I do.

I'll borrow all that fiat at 4% from the banks and let me Bitcoin go up in value faster than 4%
although i guess payments would need to be cashed out

They changed their manufacturer and mattress style, and I've heard better reviews from friends about the newer one. I definitely don't think they're fake reviews.
However, I bought a $200 queen foam mattress from Overstock and I am completely happy with it.

For the sellers who also sell on OpenBazaar, prices will be able to be cheaper - which will then attract customers. badabingbadaboom

O'Fallon Illinois eh? I grew up near there.
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:13:10
Really? What a sad outlook on all the opportunity out there. It really isn't that hard to build up a decent amount of wealth. Of course no one wants to hear that sacrifice is how most people get wealthy.
@_date: 2014-07-12 09:17:25
It's not that I don't trust Coinbase. I'm fairly confident in their ability to handle my funds and restore compensation if they make an error.
I don't trust the U.S. government. I'm keeping the majority of my bitcoin keys offline. If there was some kind of retarded bail in or something of that nature I will still have my money.
Also, I feel fairly confident with them holding my Bitcoin at this valuation level. When Bitcoins are worth $10,000 or more each, my stash will be much more valuable. I'm not going to leave that kind of money sitting in the hands of a startup.

2.2% inflation adjusted returns on Dow may not be perfectly "flat" but it's definitely disappointing. Savings accounts used to give that.
This is why my serious money is in smart real estate plays. Way better ROI.
And if "Joe retiree" bought $1000 in Bitcoin today he either loses it or his retirement is completely taken care of. That's a gamble I'm willing to take.
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:43:09
Keep selling on LocalBitcoins!
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:33:26
Yea that's kind of the point right now. New people don't know how to buy Bitcoin - these ATMs make it easy and "real". People who have been around Bitcoin for a while can sell a little easier through exchange/Coinbase accounts or Local Bitcoins. The biggest demand is "How do I BUY Bitcoins?"
