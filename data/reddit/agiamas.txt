where are the speakers?
and I can't even understand why someone would register for the early bird without knowing the speakers lineup. And this not being Google I/O or JavaOne or something like this :)

It's really unbelievable. Just another step in the sliding path towards totalitarianism...

Greece, being in the shitty financial position that it has been for the past several years, has already made cash payments of more than 1,500 (maybe it's 2,000 but no more than that...) illegal. You need to use a cashier's check. You need to deposit you money into failed banks of a failed state to use them. 
And then because..capital controls..the receiver can only withdraw 420Euros/week out of the banking system.
So fellow Germans, this is only the beginning. Enjoy the ride (not) :( :@ ...!

... and what other vulnerabilities may exist in their code....
That's the most important part. Especially since it's not really open source, but only claiming to be OSS for marketing reasons, there may and probably there are way more serious vulnerabilities if they don't care to generate an SSL cert in freaking 2017.
Shame Shame Shame :/

Northern cyprus is basically a Turkish controlled puppet government. I don't think Turkey would try that anytime soon. Not with the current government at least...
The Republic of Cyprus on the other hand, and thankfully for them, is a free democratic country and a hella lot more progressive. If they pulled it once with Russian offshore money and got in a nice ride for the past 20 years, they could do it again, this time with virtual currencies...
this is great news towards virtual currencies adoption.
