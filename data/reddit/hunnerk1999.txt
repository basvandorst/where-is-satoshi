i see both as stores of value, at a current valuation i’d rather speculate and invest in bitcoin instead of RE. as with any market there are cycles and specifically where im located (toronto, canada) housing is insanely inflated due to foreign money being pumped in. i will purchase a couple houses once prices correct in some way. i see nothing with your arguments, it all just depends on what path society takes and what the government does to keep economy going

a world becoming increasingly predatory with government sovereignty (through surveillance and stripping of privacy) will always push society toward three outcomes:  
1) a majority of sheep 
2) a non-physical technological revolt 
3) a physical revolt 
referring to the second point, bitcoin would be part of the first underlying  attempt at taking back some sort of privacy/freedom, alongside a more casual use of VPN’s by the average person 
regarding the american economy, the constant inflation due to QE only works till it doesn’t.. which they are approaching a threshold of being net-negative. i believe a crash is coming any day now even though QE4 has technically been announced through the balance sheet expansion. 
You’re right about precious metals falling alongside a falling economy but the rebound has historically rocketed toward new heights to catch up with the lagged correlation with fiat inflation (precious metals have been proven to be purposely manipulated and suppressed in price)

halvings are indicated by the red verticals. remember this is all dynamic trends, none of it is manuals, just algos. with many catalysts (bear or bull) coming this year from unstable international tensions, market crashes, potential recessions, crypto ETF’s... we may see a flight to BTC or fall with most indices.

its not based off hopium, ive rode along since 2014 trading and compounding along the way. the catalysts are the implementation of crypto ETF’s, global market crashes, recessions.. etc. the world is in a vulnerable position right now

markets running off algos, institutional money, and retail follow through. as ive said multiple times already, this is all DYNAMIC, it is not manually drawn. this is taking into account that recessions and crashes push retail to flight into BTC.
