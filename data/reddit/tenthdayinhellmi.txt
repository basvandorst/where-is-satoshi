That was only because they were using the goverment in some sort, and or was lying about what exactly they were doing.

Yes a free loan that raises prices through inflation for everyone else while they get free interest and the free loan they got didn't extend to the people.

What the fuck are you talking about.

Neither sub is pro bch, so your statement is confusing as fuck.
Now if you said it was more or less anti bch or more pro bitcoin than this one then i might have understood you...

Oh yeah, except you know. When the mempool fills and the blocks cant process all the transactions even into the LN. There is going to be some pretty fireworks next year. Maybe then you will start to sing a different song.

calling something an altcoin implies it is a coin, crypto.
the dollar nor a banana isn't a crypto currency even if you barter with the banana and dollar bills as firewood/kindle.
this kinda flawed logic isn't surprising in this space.

Well, you're wrong.
Alt is alternative. Coin is crypto. Alternative Crypto or Alternative Ledger.
Every coin (token maybe) is definitely an alternative, payment and currency usually, blockchain/ledger. Some want to corner specific markets and some like dash are competing in markets that overlap and or engulf bitcoin's use case. Eth is just a much of a currency beside the fact they use smart contracts. It's a currency that can have the contracts built into the transaction. Eventually it will transfer wealth when the contract executes, for example a smart contract based will. A good example is the funding and development of ICOs, they used eth as a currency, they collected it and sold it to while dispersing their product, to fund it's development, or buy a lambo.
Most of what comes around are ledgers that aim to do what bitcoin does better, time will tell which currency is the most usable, and eventually there will come a time where another coin will have a larger market cap than bitcoin, if only briefly.
By your definition, there are few altcoins. Many coins could compete with bitcoin, but they simply don't have the market penetration and recognition. The market will decide in the end.
