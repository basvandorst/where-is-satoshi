But it does reduce the amount of disk space required to store the blockchain.

how is it that doing SegWit would make increasing the blocksize a softfork?

We (or devs) dont need to decide anything for miners, but, if miners are dumb and just dont have the right software tools to do things, like, intelligent transaction selection for forming a fee market, then we can provide them with the right tools.
And does anyone have any actual evidence for what the supposed 'attack' on bitcoin is that the blocksize limit is 
needed for? No.
I agree with your analysis that using the block size limit for any type of economic policy is wrong, but so is believe that any one group has the this power anyways. And, the software can make all the decentralized decisions on its own. Some of these decisions, such as what software to run, are decisions made by humans.

1) I didnt think miners were supporting RPF yet
2) I thought it only allows you to up your fee, and not remove any outputs so as to keep it safe.

If developing a fee market is the goal of the core devs who dont want to raise the 1MB block size limit, I just need to ask, why aren't the core devs working with the miners to create smaller blocks? 
Pieter Wuille recently wrote here 
"Some people have called the prospect of limited block space and the development of a fee market a change in policy compared to the past." "My personal opinion is that we - as a community - should indeed let a fee market develop,"
