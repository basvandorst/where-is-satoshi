And that's your opinion. I found it quite amusing.

420 coins, not sure if that was a joke or not.

Xanax bars

As no-one's replied yet, there hasn't been a block mined in over an hour (usually every 10-15 mins) ([see "latest blocks"]( and [this fee predictor website](  suggests it will go through in about 3-4 blocks tops (personally I've found they tend to go through quicker). That being said I don't know if there will be a backlog of transactions after such a long time with no block, I don't know enough to know if that's how it works.

Simply: yes, fees are based on how many transactions are in the memory pool, more transactions = more competition for priority in the transacyion queue = higher fees to get close to the front.

And as I typed this a block went through.

Looks like they edited the link, but [here]( is the current article, the [search]( however still shows the headline as being bitcoin CEO.

My bad. Had a look through OPs history connecting to xanax exactly, just general drug use.

What exactly do you mean by voting scams? The reddit admins themselves have said vote fuzzing exists, it's in the code and in the FAQ.
