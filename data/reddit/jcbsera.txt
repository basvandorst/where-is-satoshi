At this point, I'd even say Q1 2018.

On the plus side, we're in a *minor* dip, time to buy more!

Technically, McDonald's fails as a payment system too.

As a BTC hodler, the prices for both are still volatile. Don't be so quick to dismiss BCH and say that this is done. It's still ~$1000 more than what it should be worth.

$5400 - a number we'll probably never see again. :)

[mfw someone says BCH is the real bitcoin](

$5400 was even better for the few minutes when that lasted. :)

Ahh, the Big Mac Index.

For reals though, get someone (ideally a parent or close friend) to do purchase for you and transfer to your wallet (you don't need ID for a wallet such as Mycelium or Bread). I suggest this much more highly than going to localbitcoins.com as the other person suggested and having a person you don't know do it for you.
Reasons why:
1. You can trust said person to deposit bitcoin upon (or even before) you give them money.
2. Like they live (presumably) very close by. It takes 15 minutes to get a hold of them to have them do it for you. Let's not even count distance though - these are people you can get a hold of in an instant (and who you can rely on to respond in a reasonable amount of time).
3. If you mom/dad/friend made an account (with your credentials obviously so they do not get access to your funds), you could always purchase more easily without going to a 3rd party service/another person who may not be as accessible. It's more convenient.

Mycelium for Android. Mycelium / Breadwallet(preferred) for iOS.
