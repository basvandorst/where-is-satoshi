You're understanding correctly. 
Afaik, the BIP39 standard means that the passphrase functionality should work on any wallet that supports the standard, not just a ledger.
Also be very careful assuming the 25th word is enough to keep you secure. It's only as strong as the password you select. Most passwords humans chose have poor entropy and can be brute forced fairly easy. If your passphrase is simple enough to memorize (and remember for years) there's a good chance it's not a secure pw.

DCA often leads to higher returns in the long run. Time in market vs. timing the market.

In that vein, you could say all laws are "voluntary". How valuable are your unconfiscatable bitcoins if they throw you in prison for the rest of your life?

I agree that fee transparency is annoying, but isn't this a good thing for cost basis? I.e. cost basis is inflated which reduces future tax burden.

I think they are referring to the idea that at some point the base layer could ossify nearly completely. Layer 2/3 solutions would handle all transactions. 
A somewhat dystopic example: let's say Bitcoin becomes the new global reserve currency and central banks centralize 90% of ownership through aggressive tactics like they did with gold in the 1930's. A financial system much like today's would develop on layer 2 via Lightning Service Providers and there would be little reason for significant activity on the baselayer beyond foreign debt transactions.

Is a default bitcoind node initiated in listening mode or is this an option? Are there any major pros/cons of being in listening mode?

Yea it's totally an echo chamber but occasionally there are some new ideas. Epsilon Theory on TFTC a couple weeks back for example.

On  doesn't that completely screw your opsec? All your anonymous trading on Bisq can be tied back to your original KYC-funded deposit.
