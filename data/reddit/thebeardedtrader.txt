Will the value of b2x be the price price as the current BTC? That’s the part I guess I’m confused at or will it start at $0.00?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:15:49
It won’t hit 10k before spring/summer time frame if everything stays the same.

Nope but trends are mostly right I was just doing my due diligence and letting people know the sky is not falling. Buy between those marks and wait for the bounce on the way up.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:58:56
So everyone who uses charts is nuts? Every single day trader and stockbroker is on the verge of schizophrenia...
Get real. I’m a supporter I’m just saying look for these values before buying.

Most intelligent post I’ve seen seen since I started posting here :). Cheers to you
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:09
$5200 is my educated guess
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:44:57
Yeah. Just a normal day in the Bitcoin world 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:41:30
Everyone’s acting as if there is a “secret cabal” there isn’t. 
My post from a few days ago, bitcoin is over valued. Simple.
The charts show $5600, not this weekend but before the end of the year. Most of you have never looked at candlesticks in your life or resistance and support lines. 
I’m a bitcoin supporter but it’s over valued the the volume has swelled. There’s quite a market resistance to $7500, trends don’t lie in any commodity.
These look terrible since I’m sitting here at a dealership getting my vehicle worked on, 
Chart 1 -The red arrows show the support lines, this is your “base”  ($5600-$6300) your resistance is the green line above, it hits and retracts, hits and retracts.
Chart-1 [support and resistance ]( 
Chart 2 reflects peaks and valleys, the “stock” runs up, hits resistance and usually falls to the last support line, (bitcoin has done this 90 Times in the last 180 days BTW)
Chart-2 [peaks and valleys]( 
People like to say “charting is bullshit” but I much rather have something tangible to see than someone just screaming to buy buy buy when they have zero market experience.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:04
Want to make a bet? 11 BTC in my wallet. All yours if it doesn’t hit $5600-6200
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:50:30
I mean I’ll buy a monkey with a dart board any time. I’ve never said it’s 100% right. I’m just saying trends usually stick. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:46:40
As soon as I’m back to my PC I’ll post my chart. Sure that’s an acceptable range. I would say that’s in the margin of error.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:59:42
I’m 63% right in my account. I’ve built my portfolio. I’m a bitcoin supporter, I’m just stating my opinion. Want to make a bet? 1 BTC arhat it will go to $5800-$6200 before end of November.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:55:24
Let me see what I can do on my mobile I’m away from my office.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:21:59
I mean take your own advice, I’ve been called a shill. I don’t think there’s any “wrong” time to buy in with Bitcoin.
It’s what you are comfortable with, I’m just saying I have my rules I follow with trades and I try not to trade with emotion. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:11:07

I would always say if you believe in the idea of bitcoin there’s never a “wrong” time 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:42:21
:) I know you where on the money though.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:41:37
Right.. you seem to completely understand logic also. Trading stocks and futures for 15yrs eh? Your work 401k doesn’t count shit for brains. 
Hey do me a favor and check your “portfolio” from your Edward Jones Walmart advisor, I’m sure he will advise you that charts and market trends don’t matter also.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:56:03
I’ve been saying the same thing at 7500... I’ve posted my charts 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:14:48
Yes because 0.19% is a pull back, early morning and afternoon is never exciting, I imagine it’s when transfers start to take place from the previous day.
BTC yesterday at one point was down 2% on the day but still rose 11%....
You have no idea what your talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:43:13
Or give a shit about the concept. The concept is everything. I don’t agree with everything but I agree with the idea that the white papers laid out. Cheers 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:26:38
Yep, I get it. No street credit on this account. For security I just try to keep separate accounts as much as possible for finance related things.
Anyways cheers to you have a good weekend HODL ;)

Except charting did show.... you have zero idea what your talking about. If you took the first quarter of this year and replicated that to current date it sits as $8400.... please do us a favor and shut the fuck up until you actually understand something. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:40:21
You know I don’t make a point of spending a whole bunch of time with bitcoin, it’s slightly unpredictable and I don’t try to play with commodities I don’t feel comfortable with, one of my rules.
I own it for principle not capital.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:11:15
I mean that’s wishful thinking, I trade on history and what my charts tell me, I’m not always right but I win more than I loose.

@_date: 2017-11-10 20:56:50
You have supports and resistance lines, resistance would be $7500 last week, kept hitting it but the market made it trend back down to $7200-$7000. 
Supports are the valleys that usually can point to where stocks (in this case bitcoin) will be comfortable at before the bounce.
I have no doubt that bitcoin shows promise of a 10k world, just not this year. It will hover in this $5600-$6300 for a few weeks.
Time to buy in those areas.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:21:41
Well then I would know a little on trading wouldn’t I? So there’s no “massive” pullback, today will still end up in a positive direction. I’m guessing 9%? Who wants to make a Bit bet?

I don’t and won’t  day trade BTC, it’s not volatile enough for me in the past, these last few days would of been great but again I believe that BTC is not to become “rich” off of. 
I have my wallet that I keep most everything in, and I always keep some in GDAx.... I would be lying to say that I didn’t sell at $7522 what I had purchased in my Gdax (prior fork canceling).
I sold sent profit to PayPal, then reinvested in BTC- bought 1/2 at $6200 then just purchase rest at $5700.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:13:23
It is in the current market, I’m not saying in a general sense, I’m a supporter I’m just saying there’s clear evidence at $7500 is overvalued. It will surpass I’m positive just not right now.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:28:58
My man! Thank you someone actually has an IQ.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:54:03
I do, depends on when you choose your support line but I’m comfortable in saying $5600-$6400 before I buy again. 
It will now do this YO Yo action, we met a resistance at $7500 and it bounced between $7000-$7500 for a week. I’m a firm believer that it will become a 10k+ commodity But not right now unless something major comes down the pike.

Had issues with gdax and with Coinbase online but mobile seemed to go just fine once I downloaded it. 
When I tried the desktop version I was experiencing everything you are dealing with now.
Wish you luck
