What should I use
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:47:11
definitely do not have enough to invest a lump sum. Is DCA the best bet for me in that case? The case of being a broke kid lol

Dollar cost averaging is your best bet if you don't know your preferred buying levels. Put in $50-$100 a week if you can afford it. .001 btc every couple of days is a good strat. .01 btc a month maybe

i regret posting this now lol

so citadel is when crypto IS currency? When the dollar value doesn't matter??
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:35:43
should i edit the comment?? you're absolutely right
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:08:19
Agreed. A 90% fall means all past resistance would mean nothing. Isn’t bitcoin meant to be evenly distributed throughout the years and eventually even out to a flat line to be true currency once all of them are in circulation

Sounds sus

I'm 19 years old and dollar cost averaging my way in slowly but surely. I have a fraction right now. Wish i could buy more right now but i am slowly accumuating.

I’m wondering the same thing. I’m dollar cost averaging my way in only buying .001 btc once or twice a day regardless of price.

it's saying if you zoom out and have at your chart like the one on the top picture, you'll look at it as if it's just the beginning. It barely looks like anything yet because it ISN'T anything yet.
