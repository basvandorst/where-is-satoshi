It’s gonna be either up, down, or stay the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:48:57
It already crashed like yesterday. Still holding tho
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:56:26
Don’t worry. I’ve used Coinbase a lot, and you always recieve the value you should. For example I bought $100 of Ethereum before a bull run, and when I received it, it was worth almost $150.

Dude stop spamming that
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:36:48
I never thought I would say this but TEAR DOWN THE WALL
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:30:55
Market in a free fall... like wtf 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:44:08
17,000 lol

Idk man if I were you I would just make one single post and leave it.

(Depending on time zones) there's only 45 mins left, it would take a good last-minute push for Bitcoin to hit 10k on Feb. 14.

Oooh, sounds tough. I hope you manage to get a new job soon so you can start putting some money back in. Good luck, dude.
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:19:16
Exact same situation here. Instead of beating myself up, I simply bought more on the way down. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:53:18
Doesn't convey well over text but okay.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:02:19
It hasn’t dipped to $4000 in this crash
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:20:10
No offense but going to jail for an easily avoidable situation like tax evasion is, believe it or not, *probably* not the best idea. Just pay your taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:43:12
Tell him not to worry. It will recover. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:12:28
Yeah I think it’s a good sign which is why I haven’t taken any money out of the market, only put more in
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:00:15
You may not like taxes but taxes are a thing. You have to pay them, and it’s the law. You can’t avoid them by saying “Haha, taxes are theft! Checkmate, IRS!” 
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:22:43
Another 15% and I’ll be breaking even. I don’t know when it will happen, but I think it will. Hopefully by next week.
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:55:12
If you haven’t bought back yet: DO IT NOW
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:13:23
Resistance at 10k is strong. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:52:49
Hmmmm... send someone a small amount in order to gain more back... where have I seen this before?
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:48:10
Yeah, I understand. And trust me I don't take offense to that because, to be honest, I agree. And taxes suck. Gotta pay tho :/
Oh well
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:06:22
Guess not
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:32:36
My buy-in target is 9.2k. That’s where I’d be willing to bet that the bottom is. I could be wrong obviously, and chances are that I am. Nobody can predict this stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:44:30
Well that was easy
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:29:58
Most fiat exchanges aren’t very good in my opinion. Bitstamp is alright. I could never get Gemini or Kraken to work. I’m personally waiting for fiat trading on coss.io.
