No.  If you're a beginner to Bitcoin and in the U.S., use Coinbase.
Localbitcoins.com works well, but there are scammers on there.

I generated a key and address offline using bitaddress.org, handwrote the encrypted private key onto a few pieces of papers, hid one in my house, the other in my parents' house, sent the bitcoin to that address.  Check the balance every now and then on blockchain.info.
Storing your bitcoin on a flash drive that you only use every now and then sounds more like 10% safe.

The guy exudes incompetence the way snails exude slime.  The more I hear from him, the more I believe his PHP coding genius lost all those bitcoins.

I'm in America, using Coinbase.  I initiate the purchase online, then wait for a week for the bitcoins to be available in my account.  Supposedly I could get them instantly with a Visa card.  I don't have a Visa card.

The biggest mistake the Bitcoin founders made was naming the software "wallets," leading every beginner to believe that the bitcoins are stored inside their computer or phone.  They're not.  They're stored in the blockchain, which is replicated across tens of thousands of computers and anyone can get a copy.
The blockchain is like a huge warehouse of safety deposit boxes and anyone, anywhere can enter this warehouse at will.  All you keep locally are the keys to your individual safety deposit box(es).

Sorry, kid, bitcoin isn't just nerds and shut-ins anymore.

When is someone going to sit this guy down in a room and not let him out until he answers a straight question about what happened to the customers' bitcoins and fiat?
More and more I think he fat-fingered some programming (since he didn't allow anyone else to write any critical backend stuff) and permanently erased the cold storage private key(s).

The public key is your bitcoin address.  It will start with a 1 or a 3 and be about 30 characters (give or take) in length.  It's completely safe to share.
The private key is somewhat longer (usually - there are exceptions for different private key formats) and is not readily displayed in most wallet software.  It is NOT safe to share, as anyone that has it can calculate its associated address and spend any bitcoins in that address.

Let me get this straight:  You started accepting Bitcoin for goods through Coinbase's merchant services.  Now Coinbase won't let you transfer your Bitcoin out of their system unless you link a bank account?
WTF, Coinbase?  Care to explain?

Let's throw around words like "crisis" and be dramatic for no reason.  Are you okay, Mike?

Mined hundreds in 2009... lost them all by formatting the keys.  Now I'm slowly buying bitcoins though Coinbase but every time I think of the fortune I threw away by formatting a hard drive I want to kick myself.

I'm in for the long haul.  i.e. I bought a few bitcoin for my unborn kid's college education fund.  So as long as it's worth something 18 years from now, I'm good.

Way to rewrite the headline to look like they invested in Bitcoin 175 years ago.
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:14:23
If you haven't used this wallet from 2 years ago, you should download a more up-to-date wallet.
It's safe to create bitcoin address(es) and give them out.  Just don't lose the private keys to the address(es) or you'll never be able to access any of the bitcoins sent to the address(es).
Create a website and try to get publicity, I guess.  But don't expect that just because you're using bitcoin that you'll get a lot of donations, especially here.  There are a lot of scammers out there and from our point of view you could be just another one.
Best of luck to you and your brother!

Your account setup and first purchase takes a few weeks to finalize.  It's annoying.
But after that, it's great.  You can assume you'll have your bitcoins in about a week, or by the end of the week if you order on a Monday.
@_date: 2014-06-18 00:35:17
Besides the molasses slow initial account setup, they've been very reliable for me.  You just have to plan ahead and assume you won't get your bitcoins for about a week.  If I had a VISA card I guess I could instabuy but I only have MasterCard (wtf, why only VISA, Coinbase?) so I'm stuck waiting each time.

I've had my eye on the U2913WM for a year now.  DELL accepting Bitcoin is likely going to tip me over the edge.

Once you have a private key, you have complete access to that address and its bitcoins.  
You don't need access to the person's wallet software or PC or phone, because bitcoins are stored in a distributed ledger (the blockchain) that everyone can access.  ("Wallet" is actually a really poor and misleading name for bitcoin client software, since wallets don't actually store any bitcoins.)  
Bitcoin uses private keys to prove ownership of addresses.  Gain someone's private keys and you can create transactions moving their bitcoins into addresses you control.

Seriously.  How can people live like this?
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:26:00
No.  Bitcoin wallets should be referred to as Bitcoin keychains, to emphasize that the coins are not stored on your local device.  All you have are the keys to the bitcoins stored on the blockchain.
Renaming "wallets" as "keychains" would help eliminate a big misconception that new users have: that their bitcoins are held in their device and safe as long as their device is safe.

Note that they only accept Visa cards.  I've got a Mastercard and still have to wait a week to get my bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-06-24 03:06:23
I only read the "How To Start Using Bitcoin" section, but found it a bit misleading/odd.
It talks about each bitcoin having a unique electronic signature before it mentions bitcoin addresses.  These are the same thing. 
It says, "Remember, it is good practice for Bitcoin addresses to only be used once."  Wait, where am I supposed to be remembering this from?  You only just mentioned it.
If I were explaining the basics of Bitcoin, I would stress that your bitcoins are stored on tens of thousands of computers all over the world, and your wallet merely holds the private keys to allow you to spend them.

Basically, mining requires extremely expensive hardware to even have a small chance at being successful.  So mainstream Bitcoin clients have no sensible reason to make mining a priority.  
There are command line programs that DO make mining just about that easy.  cgminer or cudaMiner, for example.

I'm in agreement.  I think coins needs some sort of utility to become successful.  I can use my vegan coins to vote on which ad campaign Vegans United will run?  Cool.  I can pay for veggie dogs at local chains using vegan coins?  Awesome.  I can show off how much of a vegan I am by advertising my vc addresses?  Well... maybe not.

Not really.  That would require some decentralized entity (or everyone on the network) to track individual hashing power applied to the current block, which would be a monumental undertaking.  Currently a block can be mined and distributed by anyone on the network with no knowledge whatsoever of the other parties on the network.
