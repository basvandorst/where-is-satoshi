Before Core 0.12.0, sending a higher amount would give your transaction a higher priority, which means you could more likely get away with a lower fee. Unfortunately they removed that now.

Maybe it was triggered by the announcement that the Brave browser will come with a bitcoin wallet by default, and users can earn a share of the ad revenue directly in bitcoins. Now they will be able to spend them on Steam.

I heard they hired Mark Karpeles as a consultant too.

The latter. More people competing to solve a block before anybody else (which is what miners do), does not increase the number of transactions that fit in said block.

Pointing at something that is even worse, doesn't justify doing something bad.
That said, I have no problem with Bitcoin mining at all: it doesn't exploit any cheap labour in inhumane conditions, all it does is turn energy into proof-of-work based consensus and trust. Nothing wrong with that.
