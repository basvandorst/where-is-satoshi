Listen, there's more reason that this for why gold and silver and used in currency. Purity for one, you can authenticity. Jewelry, it looks pretty, its very malleable. We have 10,000 years of consistent use as proof of utility. We've not become so modernized that we'd lose our ability to go back to this.
They both last essentially forever. Make a box of wood, put gold or silver in it. That box will wither before the contents will even rust.


What does that have to do with anything? Concentration in the market doesn't affect the authenticity or security or said currency.

All fiat goes to zero eventually. That's why Zero Hedge's tagline is: On a long enough time curve, the survival rate of humanity drops to 0.
Which is obviously correct, yet meaningless.
Same goes for this. It's important to know that all fiat currencies to have ever been created, become worthless. Why? Because cash has no utility beyond its nation state life.
Gold is different. Crypto is different. Even a transnational or local fiat is different.
But there you go.

Just because you can create an example displaying one instance of utility, doesn't negate that gold has more utility than state fiat.
And crypto has some utility regarding it's network security and decentralized nature.
State fiat has some utility, but ends when that state ends.

Source? Also, not a bad thing, given the access to create is so much lower.
Also not zero if still in use.
