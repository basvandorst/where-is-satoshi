You gotta launder the money first.

A gold bar is worth a little more than half a million dollars so it wouldn’t be burdensome unless you have millions of net worth. But I prefer bitcoin as well. At least as of now even though I hold both.

I think that the US dollar is pegged mostly to petroleum and finance (US stock exchanges). But yea you’re right it’s not free floating it’s just the most common currency that gets pegged to other currencies.

Also, wouldn't transaction batching decrease the number of transactions?

Every currency except for the dollar pegs their currency to another currency. Exchanges peg it to the USD or Euro (or whatever the local currency) even if they don't deal in the currency. I wouldn't mind if this store pegged it to the Euro to make the fluctuations a little easier to handle.

1.	Insert money into ATM. 
2.	Transfer to exchange
3.	Buy Crypto

Deposit verification isn’t an issue with Gemini. Pre-deposit into an exchange otherwise. 
Number 6 is less of an issue with exchanges. If it’s dropping or rising and you want to sell or buy you have to run to an ATM but with an exchange you just do it from your phone. 
But ATMs do serve a decent purpose: to sell if you need cash instantly and all you have is bitcoin at the time. But those occasions are rare because you should have cash in your bank account as a backup.

Also, Gemini is ran by the Winklevoss brothers. Zuckerberg stole Facebook from them.

I’m glad that Gemini approved me recently. It’s a lot easier to make moves when you don’t have to wait a week like coinbase.

If only they didn’t take a long time to approve people.

When more people trade it reduces the volatility. There needs to be plenty of people buying and selling otherwise prices fluctuate violently. Its already bad enough because of the low market cap. I trade in between fluctuations to make some profit when I see a pattern.

I was very close to selling the last time it hit $6k but I bought more instead. It paid off but now we are headed towards a similar or worse scenario. Trading is a bit nerve wracking.

Are people also factoring in the risk that other countries could follow suit if China is successful? A lot of governments don't really like the idea of Bitcoin.

The median wage of India is around $61 a month or about 0.02 BTC a month. So while they won't be able to buy very much individually, as a whole they could have a big influence on Bitcoin due to their population of 1.3 billion people. I'd like to see what the real world effects are on Bitcoin.

There's hundreds of countries and at some point some may find it politically sound to ban it. Venezuela could be one of them. Bitcoin makes it easy to trade Venezuelan currency for bitcoins which accelerate the collapse of their economy. In Greece with the financial issues people started to freak out and so they set withdraw limits from the ATMs and banks and some people found a way to get around it with bitcoin. 
So at some point some countries may look into the possibility of banning virtual coins which would in turn push it into the black market.

I love using CBD oil to sleep as well. Before CBD I used Benadryl and that pill made me feel worse in the morning. CBD doesn’t knock you out it just relaxes your mind and muscles. It’s a life saver for people that can’t sleep well.

I always get nervous with 100% good feedback scores. I feel like I may be their first scam. I treat everyone like a scammer regardless of feedback. Not in a bad way just in a cautious way.

If they're still keeping communications then there's a chance that they are not scammers. But if they keep dragging it on too much then I'd abandon all hope.
