The amount of silver in the world does not increase the supply of gold. The amount of USD in the world does not increase the supply of CAD.

Certainly this does apply, but there are several factors that are different from traditional investment vehicles.
- Deflationary asset absorbing inflationary assets, this adds a default upward trend based on both the rates of inflation of the inflationary assets and another based on the deflationary aspects of bitcoin 
- Market penetration and barriers to entry, cryptocurrencies are globally available to almost everyone with much lower minimum purchase limits than traditional investments. Traditional investments can become too expensive per unit to maintain their growth as well, while the majority of cryptos are infinitely divisible.
- Automated governance, most cryptocurrencies have the ability to be isolated from corrupt human governance unlike the majority of traditional investments. In most cases, one bad CEO is not going to take the value of a cryptocurrency to zero overnight. It would take an unfortunate series of events to create a network failure on an established crypto to have the same effect.
I believe that this is why we see the fractal pattern in the price history.

Bitcoin is the only other working example of a currency union and it may very well work better (it does). This threatens the EU project which was supposed to force EU centralization through € economic realities.

Eth miners are currently switching back and forth between numerous GPU algos atm, or at least diversifying if they don't have a ideological hard-on for a particular coin. We stand ready.

You're right, inflation encourages spending... but not truly needed groceries, but bullshit expenditures that reduce the productive efficiency of an economy. Deflationary economies trend towards further innovation rather than cheap gimmicks to extract cash before it devalues.

That small miner would still have to find a block before the big guys.

They can only keep this up while the value of bitcoin and the block reward allow them. Gets more expensive as time passes.

They don't want to give up their privileged positions as the operators of the currency spigot, they will never embrace public ledgers and deflationary currency.
