Okay, no worries. Was just wondering as I had it working for a little while, and it has been disabled again. Only recently checked up on it as I had issues with Coinbase. Anyway, glad to have such a rapid reply. Good luck.

Hey, how come UK support has dropped again?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:29:29
Innocent until proven guilty I guess.

I still don't know which sub supports which coin. Don't give me that "True Bitcoin" shit.
I want BTC, and BCH. I'll always refer to them as that.
Is it r/btc supports BTC and r/bitcoin supports BCH?

Okay then. Thanks for clearing that up!

I would like some posted to me in the UK.
@_date: 2017-02-19 22:51:49
And just hold on to them? Is there nothing I can do to increase their value whilst im holding them?
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:18:20
Blimey. That serious. Okay, thanks for that. :)

Have to stake a few bitcoin to play to keep everything funded

I bought a DCshoes t-shirt in Brighton using a TenX card. Is that considered Bitcoin? It's a debit card you load with BTC, then it's spent like Visa. All shops that take Visa can take TenX.

Shaking so hard I'm bouncing off walls!

How come I can buy Cryptocurrency when I want? Trade at my free will. If it becomes illegal, I'll still do it.

Hold my butt.
Wait a sec...

Personally, i sent a transaction from one of my wallets to another, with a 1sat/b fee, and still waiting 12 days on. Just a little test. Was expecting a couple days. Now I feel like this year would be lucky honestly...

We most definitely are sir! Honestly, I don't speak Cockney (apples and pears rhyming shit) but I know a couple phrases. Probably more than I'd like to admit... 
But yeah. We are all a bit loopy. If there is a cock up at a set of doors, its always;
"Ah Sorry!"
"Oh, Sorry!"
Does my head in sometimes... Sorry!
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:52:47
Oops. Hit a nerve!
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:47:56
Explore the crown jewels? I'll pass thanks
If you aren't British, the term "Crown Jewels" if often used to refer to ones genitals.

I was thinking that. We lose a couple hundred dollars, and people start preaching about HODL and Iron Hands. Fuck off lel. Think of the poor (albeit stupid) people who mortgaged their home to buy cryptocurrency at 20k!!!

What can I give from CPU mining? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:29:32
I only want to help, yet I get shoved to the side.
Don't ask me for a ride in my lambo, fuckers.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:26:28
Good lord where has this been all my life?! I've dicked around on leverage trying to make sweet sweet gains, instead just buggering it up.
I will be jamming them into a funding Account in Bitfinex, so they can at least return a little bit

This short jump allowed me to get out of a position thst was underwater. Sold at 10% gain, and now leaving it.
@_date: 2018-11-30 08:58:02
Minecraft mountains yeah?
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:18:56
I saw bitcoin. I saw blocks. I saw the chain. Brain didn't add it together. Still very nice!!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:22:21
Very nice. I was looking for a dig at the advert to be honest.

Well that's no good to anyone. They'll never get in if they kill you!

Just cause you cant see something, doesnt mean it aint there!
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:22:26
Oh. I just had blockexplorer.com on USD format.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:27:42
Maybe because Coinbase are thieves?
@_date: 2018-12-31 19:00:11
Bitcoin baby!
