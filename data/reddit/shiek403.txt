yeah they changed stuff so you had to restart it :D glad to see its working, you may also have quite an RRP if you set that up or had that option.
I mean... seriously, still rather scammy, I'm almost guaranteed to never reach ROI, but I mean better to take a smaller loss I guess
@_date: 2014-02-02 14:35:05
dude... consider yourself lucky...
I did the same thing, but bought my first contract WITH BTC. it was 350$ which at the time... 1.35BTC. so yeah... my mistake there
but I have to say, so far, everything they have said they would do, they have done, I will admit it is usually about 2 months after they sayd they would, but everything has been done.
what do you mean you havnt gotten payments? are you not checkign the website, because they are finding a block about twice a day (freaking pathetic) but you should still be getting the contract payment - contract fee - RRP

I think what he is saying is the contradiction of the facts that "restaurants net profit is up to 5, but they pay up to 5 in fees" and " they offer a 10% discount", completely negating the fact that you are helping their margin at all
unless they are speculatively holding in hopes of a higher price point to sell back at. but at face value, the contradiction is rather humorous

I LOVE coinbase...
but I can only use them to get money in and out, I cant use them as a trade platfom for the sole reason that I cannot create buy and sell ORDERS! if I could... id ditch gox AND BTC-e (my current primary) and just coibase all day

unfortunately, after all my research today, there is only 1 way they did everything they did
and thats they used a backdoor on my computer itself, and borrowed some sessions from me
so all the 2 factor auth, passwords, or anything couldnt have saved me.... except somehow securing my computer better... which im not sure what i did wrong... i have yet to find the entrance, i did a boot time scan, and am running 3 antiviruses to catch this thing...
but i know... i just thought i would try u know? cant hurt....
@_date: 2013-06-30 02:32:12
it is installed, it is updated every time it pops up (daily ish) and i always make sure it asks me to install the ask toolbar (which sorta acts as its md5 in my book :P )
@_date: 2013-06-09 15:15:52
This is how I played it!
oh hey... it fell... well time to go to coinbase :D if it goes up COOL!!!
if it goes lower.… BUY MORE!!! it will go up soon enough!
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:20:52
I THAN press spin afte a 0 balance... land on 3x... F M L
@_date: 2013-06-30 02:34:53
well it seems to have been done wit ha back door and session highjacking...
so all the 2 factor and all that didnt help...
and i have 2 seperate antiviruses installed, ironic part, wake up this morning, check btc-e Bal=0... NOOOOOO check antivirus.... looks like one of them caught it
for knowledge it was fynloski.a that i got hit with...

this leaves me with a question though...
when I press the generate new address button, does it just give me access to an address it already had in its banks and had access to(thus if I change a password, this address is not really secure)?
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:01:23
as I said above
I promiss you, I ran bitcoin-QT today (the 13th of jully) and pressed generate new address
I put my coins in (the 2.something deposit) than checked the block chain for that wallet
I noticed the 2 prior transactions
I moved my coins out (proving I have a private key)
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:59:10
my question is more along the lines of
if you think your wallet.dat has been stolen/compromised, so you take your wallet back, change the password, press "generate new address" and feel that now you are secure, are you fooling yourself, because all that happened is you were given "full access" to an account that your compromised wallet already had access to? thus just giving your thief access to what you thought was "secure"
@_date: 2013-06-30 13:24:53
for which website?
the problem was that i was logged in on my computer
all he did is borrow my session... so i was logged in, than so was he. no need to authenticate, login, know a password, anything. i was logged in to it, so he borrowed my session id, now he was logged in. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:29:15
this looks really cool!
@_date: 2013-06-30 03:20:52
That's why I made sure only to use nonconflicting ones... But ones that augment each other usually avast and windows essentials
They worked wonders together and I have had an issue for 2 years... Till now I guess 
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:10:10
actually I just figured out what happened :D
the money already in there was because aparently when I pressed "generate new address" it gave me one of its old change addresses
so the transactions in there are from me doing a transfer a while ago, the change address being generated, and me being given "full control?" when I pressed generate new address :D
@_date: 2013-06-28 17:04:26
Sounds Fun

did I just break the matrix?
@_date: 2013-06-29 00:20:06
On the bright side, I just got arbitraty points for a "5 spin lose streak"
on the not realistic side… all my free coins are now gone... and I never once saw green... YAY

i have an addblocker, so there is pretty much a guarentee that i didnt click a malicious link, im usualy pretty good about these things
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:04:17
where did you find the "price lock" option
I have wanted to buy from them for a while, as they are my primary withdraw account but everything I read says that they are bought at "market value" when it goes through, meaning it may go through at a high, and you have no control over it
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:05:29
cool... not really but ok :D thanks! good to know!

don't you hate it when your jinx is the cause of a crash
@_date: 2013-06-25 02:38:37
upvote here! I have never had a problem (especially since their backups stopped and I didn't have to wait 24 hours to know what price)
+1 for coinbase
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:58:43
Yes but it doesn't compile, and only shows one function...
Like I said I'm a pretty basic programmer, so it didn't make all that much sense in what it was doing
@_date: 2013-07-13 16:59:38
yeah I found out what happened after a bit of detective work :D 
was weird though
