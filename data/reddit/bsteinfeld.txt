This page has been here for a long time. Is there any other information?

Nope, it's still not up. Am I the only one that thinks that this type of service is completely awful, and is seriously hurting bitcoins. MtGox screwed up in an extreme way, and is now screwing up [almost] daily. Moreover, they aren't keeping the public informed in a timely fashion (which I would think is a necessity for a website nowadays).
I just feel that it will be a matter of time till their next screw up, and it scares me that a 2nd major screw up could severely hurt this new wonderful currency.

Now the site is up, but is going at a proverbial crawl.... How could they not have anticipated this surge in traffic? How could they not have setup an elastic auto-scaling solution (e.g. ec2)? When I think about how much they made (before shit hit the fan) I instantly realize that the people behind Mt.Gox deserve to be punched in the balls (or vaginas)!

At the start he talks about selling beers (at Hard Rock cafe) with bitcoin. How does this work as normally one needs to wait for the first confirmation.

libertybit is generally the highest in CAD.

You can register a .bit domain name or just [sell it for BTC](

How is double spending (which caused Satoshi Dice to no longer do 0 confirms) handled?

My guess is that there is less fees.
