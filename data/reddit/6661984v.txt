okay. thank you. but how do you feel about him holding my coins?  shouldnt i just hold them myself?
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:03:00
okay but the thing is i just plan on buying these coins and holding them for a very long time. at least 15=20 years. should i still not buy now? should i tell him just to send my coins to my coinbase wallet?

i have known him for 15 years. we hang out a few times a year now. he used to overcharge me for weed long ago. you would think frinds get a discount.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:03:24
i guess so
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:52:57
Thank you! thats what i wanted to know. i figured he was but i needed to hear someone else say it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:47:54
plus it feels more secure since he has been doing this for a few years
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:41:43
i did. i know about how much i SHOULD get. but im being told by my broker that i will get 4.1 is he ripping me off or is this normal?
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:59:13
today for 2400 he says ill get 4.3. im starting to get mad. im gonna just buy and keep my coins
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:50:52
okay well thats about $300, should i just buy these myself and save $300? or pay his fees. i dont know any trust worthy sites to buy coin from really. does $300 seem high in fees?
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:58:01
im not complaining, i was giving an example of his character. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:40:40
should i say no to the 4.1 then?
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:47:32
hes my friend that got me into it and he started a company. i bought from him before and he did something similar. i got less for my buck then i should. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:52:09
i do use coin base. i dont keep my coins there though. he holds them securely. should i just move them all to coinbase and keep them there?
@_date: 2014-08-15 03:25:44
I am going to do that now. i just hope the price doesn't go up by the time my bank account is cleared. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:38:51
do trezor work with coinbase? can i transfer from coinbase to my trezor? has anyone had problems doing this?
@_date: 2014-08-15 19:43:25
he said he already told me its a 5/5/0 and that hes not trying to steal from me. ugh im just going to buy a trezor and have him send me my coins. that seems to be my best bet.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:28:20
I think this is exactly what i'm going to do. buy a trezor and transfer my coins and let them sit. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 02:17:13
I do have proof of purchase and i have a scan code for my coins. i can upload all that here to show you. Just kidding. but yes i do have it. he has the coins safe with him and he said he can send them to my coinbase whenever i need them or want them to buy something.
