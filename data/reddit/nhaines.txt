If you think that "collage" is likely to be the indirect object of the verb "send", well...
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:50:56
In this case, I think it does.
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:18:50
Yes, that's much more reasonable than assuming he misspelled "colleague".
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:29:42
Since one is a verb which cannot function as an object in a sentence and the other is a noun, no.
He would either mean one or the other, so a misspelling (or not) would preclude the other meaning.
Neither of which has to do with whether or not the actual document was doctored (which it was).

I started playing at [bitZino]( last week.  Really nice HTML5 interface, very favorable rules, and when I change my account settings to display in μBTC it looks like I'm rich!  (I use BTC earned from bitvisitor for gambling.)
Needs 0 confirmations to start playing, so you can play immediately, and then you can withdraw once it has the necessary confirmations (6? not sure).  But you can play with play credits to see if you like the interface/rules.

If I were going to do this, I'd at least use a QR code to a bitcoin URL.  There's no way on earth I'd ever expect anyone to accurately enter a bitcoin address accurately.
This is sadly true even for email invoices.

Actually, you just click a comment and press "z", if you're not just using a mobile client that still has both buttons anyway.
("a" upvotes.  Feel free to test here, but only that one.)

It's better to ask than to be puzzled, so I'm glad you asked.  But the camera is simply capturing an image of the QR code pattern so it can be decoded.  A printed QR code is identical to a screen displayed one.
So yes, if you're thinking that having your Bitcoin address QR code on a slip of paper would be a nice secure way to allow others to send you bitcoins without having your wallet on your phone, you are correct.
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:17:18
Yes.  Bitfloor charges a 0.4% fee, but if you put in a limit order (providing liquidity) you have a -0.1% fee.  Yes, you can get a couple of cents per bitcoin you buy or sell.  That's how they make money.
@_date: 2013-01-30 04:36:07
It will wait until someone is selling BTC for $16, and it will implement partial trades until your order is fulfilled.
@_date: 2013-02-21 12:53:38
I've always been partial to:
0.001 = 1 bitmill (mBTC)
Although I use the other terms as well.  I suppose that mBTC and other prefixed denominations like µBTC (microbit) will be increasingly useful as 1 bitcoin continues to rise in value against other fiat currencies.

You can move a balance to another account, but not a transaction, because this is not how bitcoin works.  The blockchain records a transaction, and it can't be modified later (except by a 51% attack).  You'd have to move an address from one account to another to do what you're talking about.
It's far better to use a separate payment address for each transaction and then monitor the address.  You can represent the transaction state through your application, not directly through the accounts system.

No.  Those are software development tools.
Open-source social network tools are like pump.io, Diaspora, etc.
@_date: 2013-02-21 12:38:34
I've gone in and played around and tested some things, and not only is the developer just an all-around great guy, but everything seems very well thought out and some of the future plans that we floated sound really great.  I suggested bitmill coins and a day later, there they were.
Playing blackjack with players on either side of me is really fun.  Not to mention watching others play the minefield game!
There are plans to expand the casino and provide social areas (I and several others independently suggested this) but obviously the main development focus was the backend and games.  In Minecraft obviously the aesthetics and layout are the easy part.  I'm really looking forward to watching BitVegas expand!

As a German speaker, this looks to me more like "From today paying with bitcoins [is] possible."
Dutch: Vanaf vandaag betalen met bitcoins mogelijk  
German: Von heute an, bezahlen mit Bitcoins möglich
Yay now I'm trilingual.

If they are never confirmed, they never left your wallet.
@_date: 2013-02-15 06:43:34
That isn't nearly enough information to give a deterministic answer.  The first step would be: how did you "copy" the old drive to the new drive.
But let's stop and take a deep breath first.  If you haven't deleted anything from your older hard drive, then that means that your bitcoins aren't lost.
More than likely you didn't copy over the old wallet to a place that bitcoin-qt looked for it, and so the bitcoin client recreated a new wallet.dat file where it felt one should be.  The trick is to find the old wallet.dat file on the older drive and copy it over properly to the new drive with bitcoin-qt not running.  Then when you restart your bitcoin client you should be all set.
By the way, you have more like 0.962683077 BTC at that address.  Still, that's almost $25, so happy hunting and let me know if you want more specific help.  I'll bet it'd be possible to find the wallet with a remote desktop session.
@_date: 2013-01-30 05:16:29
By placement, yes.
The spike is pretty exciting.  I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.

Okay, but software localization is a time-consuming, highly skilled discipline that requires trained workers.
Even if you told them and they had a German localization person dedicated, they still wouldn't be able to just fix it and have it up in 5 minutes.  So in the meantime, you're better off working with the English version.
I understand why you might have taken that as dismissive, but it was the best advice availible.  What outcome were you hoping for?
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:59:20
Well, I agree on that.  I know (or seem to remember) that they were acquired but I don't recall hearing anything about them closing.
Thanks for the gold!  :D  The couple of months I've bought of gold have been with Bitcoin.  Very handy that way.
@_date: 2013-02-17 00:06:18
Yes.  That's how QR codes work.
@_date: 2013-01-21 09:33:47
Definitely glad to hear that.  :)  As was mentioned above, once you're synced back up, you'll know whether or not the transfer went through and can try again if it didn't.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:01:35
That's the trick with translations isn't it?  Your translation *means* the same thing as the Dutch and is what I would write on a sandwich board in front of my (imaginary) restaurant in English.  So it's a fantastic translation.  :)
"Now accepting Bitcoin" is probably what I would actually write because I'm lazy and wouldn't want to change it the next day.  Anyway, the word "betalen" just made my brain itch and I wanted to share.
@_date: 2013-02-19 07:42:07
Well, the Mii Plaza uses it to import and export QR codes.  Pushmo uses it for custom levels and I believe Petit Computer for DSiWare and FreakyForms for 3DSware does as well.
The Mii Plaza will do onscreen QR codes as well as create them and drop them on your SD card to post on Facebook, Twitter, etc.

I've always liked "bitmill" for 0.001 BTC.  But that may just be because I saw it first in A Dragon's Tale.

It was news to me. I don't visit the site too often and it caught me by surprise. I scanned this subreddit on my phone and didn't see anything.
I'm glad I'll be able to find out more about it when I get home. I liked the site and was shocked. Guess I'll delete this post. Thanks for being kind. :)
@_date: 2013-01-21 09:13:10
The entire transaction history is only stored in the (global, distributed) bitcoin blockchain.  Your client is simply a viewer and your wallet simply has the private keys you need to be able to spend bitcoins.
If you lose your wallet's private keys you'll be out the bitcoins.  What's important to know is that there are a lot of private addresses in one wallet, so you'll need to be sure to keep your wallet file frequently backed up in order not to lose coins in the future.
However, since the wallet doesn't "contain" any bitcoins (just the records to show that you own them), resetting your blockchain doesn't lose you anything.  They'll all show up once you're resynced.
@_date: 2013-02-15 05:42:00


Nothing--which is why you never, ever do that.  Your private key is the means by which you have access to your money and can authorize transfers to another address.
The public key is the address that others use to send you money.  If you wanted to purchase reddit gold for someone, you would find *their* public key (bitcoin address) and tell your bitcoin client you wish to send money to that address.  Your client will create the transaction and sign it with your private key, then submit it to the bitcoin peer-to-peer network.
Because your private key was used to "sign" the transaction, it will be independently verified as new bitcoin blocks are produced.  "Signing" means a one-way mathematical function that can be traced to your public key but cannot be used to trace back to your private key.
For examle, if I wanted someone to send me bitcoins, I would give them my address:
| 1NHainesjoz9zQPgyoSo87XkyRTQWwP5JT
But money can only be added to my bitcoin address with this.  It cannot be used to determine my private key or take any money from the address.

It's on the main page under the header where it says "BETS".  This appeared to be broken when I made this comment but after letting the page sit there after a reload, it looks to be back.
If you can't wait, [try opening a wallet at blockchain.info]( and you can play Satoshi Dice under the Send Money tab.

Check the top of the site.  Where it says BTC and 0h8m that means that together the pool mined a block 8 minutes ago.  Now you'll be able to check "My Rewards" and see how much you earned.  It'll be something like 8% of a bitcent.  In any case, you'll see it after something like 128 confirmations.
You only get paid once a block has been mined and 25 BTC have been produced.  Then you get paid per your ratio of shares contributed vs. the total shares contributed.

Well, you see the large display on the top of the machine.  If the internal lighting of the building it's in/near isn't enough, then simply changing the display to be black-on-white instead of white-on-black would suffice.
If the horrible 640x480 blurry camera on my Nintendo 3DS can handle those really detailed complex QR codes for level transfers in games, I'm sure the machine won't have a problem with the relatively simple QR codes used for Bitcoin addresses.
