If you use qr codes rather than USB to transfer and sign transaction data I'd still call it cold. There is still a chance malware could alter raw transaction data before it is transferred to the cold machine I suppose, but this isn't really an issue if you check destination address and amount when you click send. I'm talking about electrum cold storage just to clarify.

It is really not something an average Joe should worry about. But developers should be actively upgrading their software in order to keep the ecosystem as fine-tuned as possible. A smaller public key = smaller transaction size and thus smaller fees and more room for more transactions to fit inside a block.
An ECDSA public key is 33 bytes long rather than the 65 bytes of an uncompressed public key. So it is not just saving a few chars.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:24:15
I think what he means is that segwit made compressed keys compulsory for segwit enabled addresses which is indeed the case. For normal legacy addresses use of a compressed public key is optional.

1-2 multisig is possible. I know you can specify locktime for a transaction , but that would disable both parties from spending the coins until the block/timestamp is reached so probably not what you would want.
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:48:19
Actually I think I might be wrong with the separate blockchain. I'm sure I read it somewhere. I think it is talking about multisig where more than one party is required to unlock an input.

Anyone estimating it will drop lower than 2k are wrong IMO. Maybe it will dip a few hundred lower than 2k for a very short period of time, but I cant see people standing on the sidelines with their cash for very long at those prices.

I just don't see it happening. The fundamentals are much better than last year when it spiked at 19k. We have segwit, lightning adoption, exchanges now batch withdrawals ect. I actually think the bullrun in 2017 might have continued for longer if it weren't for the fee/scaling issues. The mining cost is also at 7k/btc as we stand. We also have bakkt and ETF around the corner.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:45:58
So this chart is saying the next bullrun will end at 20k? I'm skeptical.

Think of a batched exchange withdrawal transaction, coinbase for example. The transaction has one input and multiple outputs all going to seperate addresses of users making a withdrawal. An output is part of the serialized transaction which is comprised of: a) an amount of that is being spent, b) a locking script (otherwise known as a pubKeyScript). The locking script is written using the bitcoin scripting language and it defines the conditions that need to be met when spending the output. A transaction can contain lots of these locking scripts, each outlining a unique set of conditions for different addresses. 
Multiple inputs can be included inside transactions, just as multiple outputs can be. When spending an input you have to sign that specific input using your private key to prove you own it. You also have to provide another script that satisfies the conditions declared in the locking script of the previous transaction that created this output (we talked about that script in the first paragraph). This script is located in the scriptSig segment of a transaction (otherwise known as an unlocking script). For a segwit transaction this is slightly different and it is located in a new field called the "witness" which is not stored on the same blockchain to reduce tx bloat and fees.
The point being. A transaction is just a string of serialized bytes with rules that can spend multiple inputs, and create multiple outputs by enforcing and fulfilling rules defined in scripts.

The public key generation algorithm would take less than an hour to change for someone who knows what they are doing. Basically it just uses the y axis value of the esdsa curve, and if that number is even, a prefix of \x03 is added, but if it is odd \x02 is prefixed instead. The corresponding x value can then be derived from the y value using a mathematical equation. The old public key is the full x+y prefixed with /x04, whereas the compressed key is just the y prefixed with either \x03 or \x02 depending on the value. This might sound complicated but if you know the equation it's quite straightforward to put into code. 
Thinking about this rationally it doesn't matter too much for paper wallets because they will probably only spend one sweep all transaction at some point. But major exchanges need to change to compressed keys and use segwit because they are hogging precious block space unessaserilly.

Well actually this is just a personal project to understand the bitcoin protocol better. The test that I need to conduct would be fine with a very small amount.

I'm fed up of people giving these forks the time of day. Both are just blocksize increases in different ways. They took bitcoin code, changed a few scripts and think they are all smart and mighty. The sooner people realize this the better. Just 3 very insecure men with terrible personalities who are making a lot of money by manipulating the sheeple.

If you use bitcoinpaperwallet.com then you have an uncompressed address. Atleast that is the case for testnet addresses. I have not checked the others.

P2wpkh is bech32 starting with bc1. I am talking about the address starting with 3 which is a segwit address wrapped in a native p2sh. 
Because old wallets already support this format, it is backwards compatible and old wallets should be able to send to this address without any code modifications.
Legacy multisig addresses also start with 3, and custom script addresses aswell.

Short squeeze does not always account for price action. Check btcusd shorts from oct 14th 2018 to nov 13th. Then to on coinmarketcap and you will see the price actually lowered even though 18k shorts got cancelled.

What are your server costs if you don't mind me asking? And what hosting provider

I think if we did not have the scaling issue it would have kept increasing. But $30 fee's showed that it wasnt ready yet.

The address people send you is basically the pubkeyhash with a version byte prefixed and a 4 byte checksum appended to the end. Most programming languages have a base58decoder. In python it would look like this:
from base58 import b58decode
Pkhash = base58decode(address)[1:-4]
Please be aware that bech32 (bc1) addresses (native segwit) are not it this format.
The legacy compatible p2sh-p2wpkh address starting with a 3 ARE in this format but the "pkhash" you extract from the address would be a hash160 of the redeemscript rather than a public key hash.
P2sh-p2wpkh addresses are a workaround allowing wallets that do not support segwit yet to be able to send to a segwit compatible address.
When I refer to hash160 I mean first hash with sha256 and then hash again with ripemd160. This hashflow is common in bitcoin.
Here is a nice address diagram that I found quite useful:

Well, when you are trying to appeal to the masses, you should expect huge knowledge gap hurdles until the technology is simple enough for a monkey to use. That is when Bitcoin will flourish. 
Even if it means custodians keeping peoples funds for them (banks as we call them today). I think if people do not understand the true power of Bitcoin and are not willing to learn how to secure their own keys then we need options like this. 
It may be defeating the purpose of owning Bitcoin, but that is the choice of the individual and it will not affect other's who use the technology properly.
Although, if too much trust is based on these centralised structures. I think we would start seeing IOU paper Bitcoins, so it is probably better to avoid this whole scenario in the first place.

This explains it quite well. When a p2pkh output is spent, a public key must be provided inside the scriptSig (unlocking script) which hashes into the scriptPubKey (locking script) keyhash. This is done inside the witness field in a segwit p2wpkh transaction rather than the scriptSig which is left empty (unless you are sending from a legacy compatible segwit address starting with 3, otherwise known as p2sh-p2wpkh where things are a little bit different).
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:34:40
Incase ECDSA is broken making it possible to generate private keys from public keys. Only really applicable if you never re-use addresses because pubkey is revealed in the scriptSig/Witness when an input is spent. Not to mention it is shorter so saves block space and results in cheaper fees.
