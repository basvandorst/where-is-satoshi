That's exactly what I thought, it looks like he drills right through a part of the code. I don't know how QR codes work.

High school geography class in Texas: Teenagers didn't even know Hawaii's ocean. Motherfuckers thinking Cuba is Hawaii and Hawaii is Cuba. Moved to Texas in middle school and they put me in elementary, I thought wow these guys must be smart. It was like going from the big kid's table back to the crib; the Texas education system is a tremendous pile of shit. 
*Please Texans, do not vote for Greg Abbott in 2014.* Thirteen years of Rick Perry is taking its toll on the state.

I don't think the tribe thing is entirely accurate. Teacher problems equal principal problems. Her fuckup is his/her fuckup because he/she is responsible for the teachers. The hierarchy may be different in OP's school however. I've never heard of a "cyber school" for 8th graders, for all we know it could be some religious shit or something that can do whatever it wants with no external policing. I was tossed out of one of those nutbag preschools at age 5 for writing about the movie Highway to Hell when assigned to describe a movie. My parents protested to no avail, the glorified daycare could do whatever it wanted.

Granted I mostly covered early childhood teaching styles, but there are quite a few different schools, as you say. Some are focused entirely on the promotion and development of creativity, like Reggio Emilia schools. 
Even when school seems to eradicate creativity, it's more a dysfunction in the system of power, the trickle-down-corruption from political influence at the top of the ladder. Save for some whackjob private cultist schools, no teacher goes into education with malicious intent.
