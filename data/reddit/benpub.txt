Monday "happens" and probably non event when over, requirements are so high its actually smarter to buy the coin.  The real instrument would be an fund or etf like gold or silver that has the equal amount on hand. When that happens, we overshoot the moon.  Currently about a 13 million coin float and the whole world trying to buy in.  Not just a few etraders.  Simple supply and demand. Economics 101

You know if a regular brick and mortar store chain like penny's or sears or say best buy, took the example of overstock and started taking bitcoin, they could increase their visability, stock price, bring in some new buyers and maybe have a shot at reviving their sales and help them compete with amazon.  think of the advertising, the mentions on CNBC and bloomberg, the same chatter could flow to them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:04:21
Having such a low float is one of my primary choices for Bitcoin. Store of Value that is limited. So with about a 16.5 million coin float, the games of manipulation will subside. This is what will cause the stratospheric prices.  Idiots trying to manipulate a low flow Bitcoin.  I don't know of anywhere where you can short the actual coin so, it can zoom up faster that imaginable.  Maybe coinbase needed the dip to cover the buy's pending?? If people hodl and demand is there, the prices will soar.   simple supply and demand.  And the futures have absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin price. Putting your coins in your own wallet helps the price go higher as the supply on the market is limited thus helping the scarcity and valuation.

Hi Adam, as a hodler of Bitcoin, ETH and LTC, imo, the cause of the selloff is the basic FUD created by Bitcoin Jesus to hype his own currency, kinda like a used car salesman slight of hand. He has a few cohorts in the game that are assisting him.  Bitcoin is what people hate...Purity... perfect..not yet but on its way..yet pure untainted by the likes of someone or group that wants to be the money czar of the world.  Bitcoin's purity is what impassions the community not the used car salesman schtick.  Has it changed my thesis...no..the purity will prevail, bitcoin will reach extraordinary heights, and will evolve to the standard for money exchange.   You are from London, then you are quite aware of the times we are in...quite disruptive, Brexit, Trump, Bitcoin. Yes its all messy and some don't quite get it.  But the disruption will and is is happening and it is unstoppable.  And for a demographic, white male, USA, California, seasoned,  and trader for over 20 years.

Sounds like a great add on product for the exchanges to create for users or even a wiz developer for taxes.  Not that it's unheard of since etrade sends out a statement and a spreadsheet of trades.  You make money you pay your taxes. Hold it a year it's taxed at capital gains tax, I think about 15%, daytrading/swingtrading taxed at regular income rate in US. Every Trader in the US complies and the IRS is sent a copy to match with your return.  If you're gonna trade, yes you pay your tax bracket on how much you made.  Hodl over a year and its capital gains.  And if you have losses in the market you can offset your gains with them.  Just life.

Cash Futures expire Friday, US Market closed Thursday,  Early outs Wed and Friday.  US on basically a week long holiday.  tommorrow they will start liquidating grayscale holdings,  Whales have been shorting the Cash Futures for a while and BTC was heavily short Friday, Whales are pounding the sells, killing off everyone they can to maximize the fiat win from cash futures.  No one wants to talk about holding BTC at the thanksgiving table.  This is a cascading sell off and is only getting worse.  There is not enough liquidity in the market to absorb the sells and the whales know it, so they crush the price.  by Friday i expect very low 3's, like 3180.  No one of substance or volume has the balls or cash to stop this.  Once friday passes BTC will settle back in to crypto winter.  Every time this type of action occurs you get lower highs and lower lows. It will bounce at some point after Friday....maybe if all confidence hasn't been sucked out of the market.  But 10K naw not happening again in any kind of near term if ever.  McAfee will eat his member next year and the halvening is more than priced in.  We are now in wave 6 of an Elliot wave theory that should only have 5 waves.  Whales and Cash futures, don't need a government ban or regulation, they will end BTC on their own.   And an ETF???? buy a clue, will never happen.    OG whales are the real enemy no one else.  Absolute manipulation.  Good Luck and stay quiet at the Thanksgiving table, lest you be laughed off to the little kids table!

@_date: 2019-11-25 05:58:14
they buy futures at the lower prices to offset their risk all due at the same time.   say i sold you a contract for one coin at 5000 while btc was 9000, it drops to 8000 i now buy another contract  to offset that one, and just keep doing it to cover myself.  since there is NO BTC involved here it just paper contracts.  All that matters to them is the "closing price" on futures expiration date.  The whale KNOWS how far he can push because he knows how big his bag is.  and he's buying all the way down anyway.   its not that hard with thinly traded issues.  as i type btc is 6535 on coinbase, if i market sell 10000 coins what would happen???
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:17:17
well your right to think that. but the cash traders and whales are playing this issue like a fiddle, that is exactly why you have  20k high, 17k, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10 all highs but on the down side.  no new highs only decesending highs.  whales have sucked all the energy out of the market and played the futures the same.  new money to BTC is gonna get more scarce with each lower high and each deep drop.  Cash futures are inflationary to the non inflation hard money btc.   Without Cash Futures BTC imo would be in low to mid 5 digits.  Allowing Cash Futures inflates a hard cap of supply.  if all those cash future traders had to acutally buy a coin, the supply would tighten as was intended.  Anyway have a great holiday all.  Mums the word on BTC at the Thanksgiving table!!
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:48:35
That's the rub here.  There are probably only ever maybe 17 million and no more that about 13 million or so now. figure 75% hodling, so about 3 maybe 4 million coins in the trading float??  That amount of coin is controlling the price.  However with derivatives, you are right, they create the fake btc, and the stupid 100x leverage accounts how f'ed up is that. Just plain stupid.   BTC is hard but the paper futures are criminal as is the 100x leverage.  My broker typically gives me 2x leverage or i go options or futures. And if any of you have your coins on an exchange and not actively trading, well let's just say thats kinda dumb, and if they allow shorting and your coins are on that exchange then i'd have to say that's pretty kinda dumb.   Get your coins in your wallet unless you're actively trading.   Cash futures on bitcoin will be bitcoin's demise.
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:34:50
whale buys a futures short contract for say 5k a coin....cheap last month.   btc at say 9k  doesn't look like it will get there so the contract is cheap.  Whale then goes to exchange, and probably a collective of whales, and they start the selling, people panic, voodoo technicals get hit and sells are triggered on the order books as the whales have enough coin to make waves and scare the little fish.  So now the whales can buy from the sellers, and keep pressing the sell accelerator. finally when they have let the thing bleed out its friday btc at 3200 and they collect the fiat bank big time based on the closing price of the futures and the short contract they bought.  so its the futures options writers that take the hit, but they are like bookies too and they lay off these bets all the way down.  However IMO this month in particular with the American holiday the way it is the markets are quiet, many gone, thats why they have been pressing the sell button all month just to get to this week so they can slaughter the lambs, and get paid.  I don't think many thought 3-6k was ever gonna be a number btc would see again.  But OG whales can play this game every single month.  Give me a 100000 coins and I can probably dictate the daily price of BTC.  Traded stock market for years, this is a freaking 15 million unit issue at best and it's more manipulated than any stock I've seen even from the "Blue Horseshoe Loves" days.  Don't be surprised at how low this will go this week.  Its a freight train coming down the mountain.

A responsible government WOULD buy bitcoin as a hedge against its on deflationary fiat.  If you think about it, the US government has about 11 trillion in current gold value all in.  running a 21 trillion debt and ever growing.  Having some bitcoin that hits the big numbers wouldn't be such a bad hedge. Especially if they bought them now.  But knowing the US government they would buy at the all time high, kinda like they did with oil filling the SPR.   Not really financially strategic but hey they do have a printing press.   
Bitcoin doesn't need to be tied as it is it's own commodity. Per most governments.  The point is to unshackle from the oppression of central banks and corrupt governments.
My opinion is I would rather hodl, not spend, although spending is fine and the network and hash rate are growing exponentially.  I'll take the ride as a store of value and spend depreciating fiat.

The time is about now.  Mt Gox is NOT selling coins, will return coins to the owners, not fiat.  FUD is at its peak. Way to much infrastructure in place for the future.  SEC declares Bitcoin Currency not a security.  Nasdaq launching, etfs coming.  Hash rate at its highest and rapidly growing.  Weak hands are flushed as was the intent of the market.   The reversal of the Mt Gox selling is the removal of a huge overhang.  So a few of the Japanese exchanges were ordered to clean up their act.  Hey it is legal currency in Japan, they should clean up their act.  Coinbase has its high roller index fund, responsible holding facilities are in place for institutions.  Yeah now is about the time.  And removing the Mt Gox overhang takes away the shorts cover.  Today is an inflection point.

As long as you have cash settled futures markets and whales and the sheer lunacy of 100x leverage, this is what will happen in perpetuity.  If you buy the story of bitcoin, get your coin's and get them off the exchange.  Stop trading margin ( margin is really not "hard" money").  Buy when they dump, put your coins in your wallet and let the supply dry up.   All Cash settled futures are the enemy of the entire bitcoin thesis.  Whales will rule forever, and you will always have pump and dump.  Get your coin's off the exchanges unless you are selling them.  That's the only time they should EVER be on the exchange.

Just as it overshot to 20k to the upside, it will overshoot to very scary lows to the down side, IMO 3k is to high, panic has yet to hit.  Although i have bids at 3kish i have them a lot lower also.  Bitcoin isn't going away its just getting played like a violin right now.
