if alts are tied to the bitcoin price will everyone that buys alts not be forever in debt to bitcoin (store of value)

im writing up a whitepaper to suggest a different store of value, one that i think will be evenly distributed on registration. a mashup of civic and neo but with a free neo token (per person) that will ultimately generate gas (the currency)

i hope so :) i worry that the majority holders will never need to cash or exchange their bitcoin as i think they will be able to maintain an amazing standard of living just from their alt coin shares.

the amount of bitcoin held by the exchanges is one of my concerns. it think it is very easy to manipulate price if you hold even 10% of the supply. bitcoin has opened my mind and many others and im thankful for that but if all other cryptos are pegged to its price doesn't it give the majority holders power over all the underlining tech ?

i think early investors should be rewarded and taking bitcoin back from people that hold through all the fud would be unfair. loyalty like that is rare and having panic sold a few times i know how hard it is to separate good and bad information these days. i think the perfect world crypto should be distributed evenly in the beginning and have no central power.

hahaha :)

is this not how some banks manipulate price today, buy and sell with other peoples money. im not against crypto or bitcoin im just trying to highlight concerns so we can solve problems that could improve the system :)

i respect and understand that bitcoin was targeted at intelligent middle-class but very little people knew or even understood it back then. from my perspective it was introduced to the average joe at about $1000 a bitcoin. it only gained respect after the first retracement to $3000 (when jp morgan bought massive amounts on the sly). $1000 is incredibly intimidating for a nurse or a fireman who earn that in one month (3rd world). they can probably afford $100 (0.0055 BTC) i just think its unfair that people who risk the most everyday will stay devalued on the new system, if so we are solving nothing.

some people never touch a pc in their day to day life ,some people work in mines 20 hours a day. my friends great grandfather worked on a typewriter his whole life. i think these people deserve the right to move their money over to a new system at a fair price

i think crypto has everyone's attention. if you were to say for example download a bitcoin app and when you register you would get one coin (money) that will generate spendable tokens (currency) starting on a specific date.  people would have time to sign up while it was marketed. once we hit the deadline the free market would open and alls fair. i understand bitcoin started in a similar fashion but we are in a different space today regarding tech adoption and understanding. theres more to it (technically) in order to keep it decentralized

i agree without these people there would be no bitcoin and no blockchain . they deserve the reward because they supported the tech however i think  mass adoption of a one world currency will only happen if everyone is invested  from the beginning.

I'm working on a whitepaper :)  
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:30:00
open and free to everyone that owns a computer and an internet line. Im a supporter and its an amazing first step, Im just looking at improving.
money buys my food and pays my rent, i want one world and we cant do that without everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:57:46
i just feel everyone should have opportunity in the beginning if we are going to make a one world currency, after that people should be responsible for their own wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:23:56
most people in third world countries still don't know what bitcoin is. 
lets be honest , if bitcoin was to become the new world currency the value in dollars would only matter to those buying in. the guy with $100 in life savings would still be poor in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:10:44
i agree traditional currency's have the same problem and crypto would be a better system, however my concern is that people with very little tech knowledge will see very little of the pie if this inflation continues. should non tech or finance savvy people pay $50 000 or more per bitcoin just because they are skilled in different industry's. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:08:10
im working on a whitepaper. 
it is natural however i think we have a responsibility to ourselves to give everyone equal opportunity to invest from the beginning. i think everyone knows about bitcoin and blockchain after this boom, i have no doubt that this is the future of money, imagine if you could give everyone one bitcoin tomorrow. the whole world would be invested in it ,and humanities, success.
