Don't you think by essentially telling us the rule kida proves the ownership?
@_date: 2014-02-28 10:12:29
I didn't find it funny. I didn't laugh a bit.
Do I have a bad sense of humor?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:13:29
No. For money. As an underage kid, your parents are in charge of your assets.
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:44:47
It's actually a good news.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:24:27
I mean really really pissed. Swearin' n' shit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:58:49
It's actually a good news!
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:40:48
OP; are you retarded?
You asked why did they open a phone line when all the information is on the webpage.
She answered that they like to hear your problems and your feedback.
And then you ask the same question again. Twice!
TL;DR: the line is for MtGox to get information, not the customers.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:28:14
This has nothing to do with me, I just hate Keiser's approach.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:14:47
Exactly. You put it better.
OT: I'm wondering what's up with this reddit ranking algorithm.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:51:16
Where is NSFW? I thought I was going to see your dick.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:04:36
I wonder... What does guarantee that the balances are paid in that proportion to everyone, and not just in full for those who have funds to sue, leaving everyone else with finger in their asses?
Would anyone like to elaborate on that?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:40:54
Sorry, but you are no better than MtGOX.
They, too, were playing with the money that wasn't theirs.
Sorry for your loss, however.
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:57:55
Could anyone repost bitcointalk thread for exchanging BTC for goxBTC, for anyone interested?
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:11:54
Have around 5. None at MtGox.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:22:16
Watch this:

CSI approves. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:32:18
This whole story is fishy.
1. Wouldn't the neighbours say anything? If Satoshi Nakamoto was my neighbour, I'd have a pretty hard time thinking what to do. Unless he bribed them, that is (jk :)
2. Why use your real name, if you don't want to be discovered? This clearly shows he wanted us to find him and attribute him (Nobel prize, which can be awarded only iff person is still alive)
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:55:49
This is suspicious.

Not true. Trivial lower bond.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:42:47
Why do that, if you can manipulate the market to literally give you coins with $50M investment (and get the investment back).

It's bitcorn.

"the new version is so stable, they'll give away 0.01 BTC if you find and report a bug."
Now that's stable. Call me impressed. :)
@_date: 2014-04-09 13:55:46
It is going to be a completely new wallet based on bitcoinj.
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:28:37
If you do that from the same computer the original password has been stolen from, then I have a bad news for you.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:31:03
No, it's not truly great news. Imagine 20% VAT on every purchase.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:01:24
It's the same as Ubuntu was named Linux for human beings.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:42:48
Did they ban roads? One just can't ban speeding or drunk driving.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:33:13
No, you have to ask your parents for permission. At least in USA and a big part of Europe.

This. However, the reference implementation client is in C++.

Define early adopter. I went in on $280, and I don't feel alike.
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:50:11
My question exactly.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:41:39
Dein Engrish bist interedasting.
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:23:21
Yes, sure. But that is incorrect.
You're talking like E is the name of some "party" mix, but it is just adulterated MDMA, which is mostly unwanted.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:32:14
You mean at the price of $132? Nobody's going to take that offer.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:53:48
Police? What police?
Rumors, stupid. They spread quickly. If Satoshi lived in my town, everybody would know this the same day it was on the news.

Your thoughts went loose.
@_date: 2014-03-22 18:31:01
Wouldn't that be actually inflating bitcoin supply? People thinking they have bitcoin while they don't?

"We look forward to having the last laugh with you."
he trully meant:

The price is apparently rising.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:25:28
I expect them to auction them in batches, let's say 100 BTC per batch. This way there is a lot more diversification, since more entities buy them. Moreover, the price is fair, for the same reason.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:19:14
You're just a 17 yr old kid. You should've asked your parents before "investing".
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:59:33
That is irrelevant of what I am asking.

Almost no cash withdrawals.

Your examples are unrealistic. Bitcoin is not yet worth $100,000.
Not yet. But for now, at least two more zeros are needed.
@_date: 2014-03-24 16:25:34
When you see it... :)
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:20:04
6... Those who bought at the peak, when Keiser Fuck was promising a value of $100K per bitcoin. He has been hyping the nation for his own gain.

Why are you downvoting him, he's just thinking out out the box.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:29:50
Well, they have found BTC, not fiat, so your proposition sounds nonsensical. But assuming Gox...
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:19:39
Hey, we're talking MtGox here :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:24:32
If he didn't, someone else would. Don't give him such credit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:51:40
11 downvotes, 1 upvote:
edit: I guess times change.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:41:08
Wrong! We have seen what 2 mil dump / pump can do.
Bitcoin price stability is the weakest point. Attack there, much cheaper.

Sure. That why 2FA is for! They have to have both.
Don't underestimate windows malware.

This is a scam:
1. There is no company address listed.
2. Domain registered using privacy protecting service (domain owner is unknown). 
3. Only 12 different laptops, every one slightly underpriced.
4. Their facebook page is apparently this: 
Prestashop is a PHP based webshop software.
Keep away!
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:38:23
Every account? Just those with already compromised passwords, due to malware. No point in doing that for others.
I'm not implying it's a huge probability. It is not impossible.

His. Since his ass is going to be kicked.
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:27:02
No, it would have been infinite, since there wasn't any supply.
If it would have been zero as you said, that means you could get bitcoins for free, which is not the case.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:37:32
For the stupid ones, we are talking about the price of non-existent resource. He has said it's 0, I have said it is infinite.
Bitcoins were non existent resource before 2009.
@_date: 2014-03-30 08:29:37
So, if you bought at $.01, the order was reversed? It's not you could actually get bitcoin for one cent?
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:54:03
You mean 6 month low...

Thanks for this godsent answer.
Tell me please, why would anyone sane want to buy profit shares under such conditions?
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:24:01
Those who have, are obligated to keep quiet.
But from my point of view, this is kind of unfair, since big fishes who can afford lawyers are going to get the money first, then, if anything remains, everybody else.

Rather admit you are stingy with the money so mr. Kodrič can afford a new Tesla and 40 virgins to fuck.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:19:30
IT'S A TRAP.
Think about it. No serious company leaves comments like this in their source code. What is even a point of such comment? For the worker in night shift to let him know what he should work on? For their PR dept which apparently edits HTML?
It's clearly their intent for us to see that and follow a certain plan, just like that pump few days ago when they let through few transactions and the price jumped to $300.
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:55:33
The problem is manipulation. If you have a large proportion of a total market cap, you can manipulate the market to give you even larger holding.
@_date: 2014-03-30 09:43:30
Therefore it's unfair to say there was a crash.
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:44:25
Yes, you do, but only the first time. If you then resell that soda, you don't anymore.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:31:15
That'd be foolish.
Any timeframe is enough for an attacker to attack. Don't risk.
