It can be spam as well, or new security driven procedures at exchanges.
Be honest the price is the most important "metric" for everyone here involved. And that is absolutely dreadful.  
Transaction number does not help price if it just means money velocity goes up, wealth storage in bitcoin intentions help price.

Stop good news now! All the good news made Bitcoin loose 50% of its value.

They need to rollback and show fucking hackers to stay away from NXT. That will increase price. I for sure will be pissed if my thousands of dollars of NXT is lost at BTER.

It does not work, I have 10+ confos on a test transaction so all my systems would be robbed already... And there is no notification...
I will go the Blockchain wallet backup route.

Or compare that with the 19 year old guy that ddosed a gaming server and is expected to get 10 years

Anyone wants to pay to the prison guards to rape this piece of trash Ryan Kennedy every day?! He stole from many of us including me.

In the light of recent news I went to a good lawyer and I am just back!
Simon the most important for you is to avoid criminal charges and return the money of clients!
Send an EMAIL CONFIRMATION from the balances of each user!!! Without that in the end all the money will go to the state and the banks are happy to use it in the meantime!!!
-If you cannot account for all the money you have, you can be criminally charged and you will be!
-Us users without the confirmations CANNOT TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE BANKS. With that email confirmation we can find a lawyers in Polland and in Germany who will give us discount and in the first step sends out masses of official mails to the banks involved to release our money.
-Some may sue your company, but they will sue it anyways and it is limited. I think we have a common enemy and to help you in the fight we need official confirmations A.S.A.P.
In case you have less money due to the bug than claims, it is STILL BETTER TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE than ACCOUNT FOR LESS. Your company is limited for losses but you are not limited criminally if you happen to have more than you can account for.
People vote this up such that he see this as his priority!

From the information given by TAIS it seems that any legal action before the 7 days deadline for the unfreezing of the polish account is premature. We the clients cannot rush this process unfortunatelly.
If the funds are still frozen by the end of the week, than we might think of ways getting our money back sooner! I think NOONE wants to wait another 3 months, the next deadline the polish bank gave for unfreezing the EUR account!

Be aware that this may be a phishing email. There is a more established organization already. None of the emails match!

There is already a forum for that.  We need only one. In case you have high stakes and ready to pay for a lawyer &amp; private investigator than you should join my circle of verified victims. Pm me here (click on username, top right send message)

I offerend 1000Eur below out of my own pocket in case his acounts are frozen to pay for lawyer. I think it helps more to offer out of your pocket than from a frozen bank account.
At least he know he can get it if he needs it.

Oh and how the other argument that BTC balance is less than needed, due to exploiters. So all losses have to be shared between BTC owners...
I bet you do not like this one either, so suck it up! It is the same sending my lawfull BTC there and selling it in a lawfull trade, to non exploiter. And you sending your lawful BTC there... If you do not see that you are an idiot!

Hey TAIS46, I am very pissed at the fucking german authorities! I have 15000Eur legal money at your site. Hard earned money. 
I am willing to pay into the legal fees 1000 Eur, I am sure if everyone with legal big money there would do the same we get the best lawyer! This whole unfair deal against us legal users have to go to the media NOW. I know police nowdays around the world only care about PR and do stupid things otherwise!
-Best Lawyer
-He can help than with Media
-There must be a public outcry that authorities stealing money
-You need to hire a guy who starts the IDing of accounts as well!

Please everyone try to independently verify that his accounts are frozen. There is now a link on the bitcoin-24 page to the official document finally. It seems Simon and us are both victims and we have to change tactics... The real thiefs are the Banks triing to kill bitcoin. I am consulting lawyers right now...

Read the posts. Everything is interrelated. You cannot just pay out all coins if there are losses on the exchange. Its an exchange for god sake!
It would be not fair for FIAT owners to not receive anything back, and the coin owners everything... 
TAIS46: We hear only reasuring words from you which makes people in the know even more nervous. Be honest and tell us how many percent less money will we get back. I understand it may take time to roll back bugged trades and you dont know yet, but be honest with us. A lot of money is involved so that is the only way. Otherwise hundreds of people sue you and we do not want that!

If anyone ever gets hold of TAIS again, tell him to place a BACKUP DATABASE at a LAWYER everyone trusts. Without that noone will ever get a cent back!
