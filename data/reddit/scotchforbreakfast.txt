Then what took you so long to buy?
Bitcoin was $700 a coin last year at this time.

Would you sell if it dropped to 10000?
How about 8000?

Do you think that most people here invested prudently and only allocated a portion of their speculative portfolio to bitcoin?
Or are they FOMO morons piling on at the top of the bubble?

So, how is this actually good news?

What you are missing is that people will violently compete for social power.
Hobbes covers this very fact in Leviathan.  This is very basic political philosophy.

The blockchain is unable to process the number of transactions that it would require to replace the current fiat systems.

I find it quite interesting that the biggest bitcoin boosters simultaneously laud the stability and security of the bitcoin market while also claiming that transacting with the largest bitcoin exchange is "high risk".
There's a word for that, cognitive dissonance.
How can anyone seriously advocate for the use of bitcoins as a currency when the largest exchange can suddenly close leaving everyone involved without any recourse whatsoever?
Regulation is desperately needed.
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:11:51
Which you all value higher than continuing to own bitcoin, increasing the supply on exchanges and driving the coin's value down.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:05:00


lol.  Criminals get away with their Crimes.
The world isn't just.

There is really no reason to use bitcoin for corporate account management, because that involves tremendous additional currency risk and compliance costs.
Would you want to have any position in a currency that could lose 50% of its value in 6 months?
Bitcoin is a speculative investment at this point, and an extremely risky one.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:25:09


Because they are scared.  
Making fun of victims gives them the psychological shield from their own insecurities.  They feel superior and can delude themselves into thinking that it is their savy and intelligence that protects them from scams.
Reality is, pure dumb luck is what protects most people from being a victim.

Actually you can deduct gambling losses on your tax returns.
The amount of deduction can not exceed any gambling winnings, however.
@_date: 2014-04-06 07:24:41
That's actually the strongest argument against bitcoin.
A massive proliferation of altcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:26:45
Actually it is.  
Trust in exchanges and entities that operate using the underlying currency is vital for the continued value of that currency.
That's why regulation of financial institutions and brokerages exists.

Come on now.
You made up a bunch of possible justifications, that even if true, don't excuse the post that this comment thread is in.
Did you read the OP?  It's full of delusions and rationalizations.  
I didn't make any psychological assessment.  I read the post and used my personal experience with scam victims to see that he exhibits behavior that puts him at high risk for being scammed again.

Bankrupt doesn't mean no assets, it means insolvent.
Depositers are at the very top of the list of creditors.  That get their money before everyone else.
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:07:22
It's value is completely subjective.
And increased market selling pressure depresses the price.
Bitcoin isn't doing what it was meant to be doing, that is, it is not acting like a currency because those merchants are not maintaining bitcoin reserves.

Any realized gain on a capital asset is taxable.  That includes gains realized from FOREX transactions.

Except that movement has no relation to actual economic activity or increased user adoption, which is what the 'volume' is supposed to be a proxy for.
How many bitcoins have you bought today?

The financial system is extensively regulated with numerous protections of investors and depositors.
Bitcoin and Mt. Gox had no oversight and no regulation.  This is a market maker failure, it doesn't get much worse than this.

Welcome to human nature.  It's always nice to see a liberal or a libertarian mugged by reality.

Has the IRS ruled on how bitcoin is to be treated?  The tax implications are different when discussing a Forex gain and a gain in a capital asset.

'Big banking' is a hell of a lot more secure than the embarrassing exchanges of the bitcoin world.
Delusional people on here.

I don't believe you read the post, or you are having a stroke that has impaired your short term memory.
Here, I'll quote the sections that are basically lauding the idea that he was defrauded.  Its delusion at full swing.






This is 100% delusional thinking.  Gox didn't need to fail utterly, taking millions of dollars with it in order to build bitcoin.  That was a pointless failure, that has no possible upside.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:40:22


How do you evaluate exchanges as better?
I mean, you got scammed by Vircurex after Mt. Gox went down.
How many times have you been scammed?

The dollar is up 111% against bitcoin over the last year.

But funds put into your brokerage account itself are protected and insured from a brokerage failure.  Because that brokerage has extensive regulations on capitalization and the treatment of investor funds.
Furthermore, if you invest under the advice of a licensed broker, his firm can be held liable if that investment fails and violated FINRA rules.

Don't be a pig, you should unwind some of your gain and diversify it.

Right, that's why you don't open your position with one purchase at one time but rather by buying over a longer period with multiple purchases.  This insulates you from the daily swings.
The same method applies when you sell some of your position.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:20:32
I gave the advise I did, namely, don't enter a position all at once, because that magnifies, both to the up and to the down, the random price fluctuations have on your investment performance.
I don't think people here are investing in bitcoin as a day trade.  They are investing for a reasons of a long term growth narrative.  For those people, allowing themselves to have a huge random walk risk is foolish and unnecessary.  Thus, my advise helps to avoid those issues.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:35:13
The main issue is exchangeability.  What bitcoin really needs is financial institutions willing to instantaneously convert bitcoin into other fiat currencies.  A bitcoin account where you can write checks in USD or euros for example.

Close, but not quite right.
An important part of making +EV bets is bankroll management.  You must be properly bankrolled for each bet.  Even if you are making bets that are almost certain winners, if you are deploying too much of your total bankroll in that bet the small probability of a loss will eventually result in you being completely bankrupt.
In investment terms, it is unwise to deploy your entire portfolio into one investment, because that investment, no matter how well thought, well researched or well executed can end up being a loser.  That's the point, bitcoin, while having a lot of good narratives for supporting an investment is still vulnerable to a number of downside risks.
I never advised anyone to completely close a position in bitcoin under these conditions.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:30:28
There is nothing wrong with closing some of your position to recoup your initial investment or offset debts that you are currently carrying.
Don't be greedy man.
