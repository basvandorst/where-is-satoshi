but don't they require you prove your identity before withdrawing/depositing? I'll stick to bitstamp I guess.

no lol .01 was like $96 a week ago, even if bitcoin hits 100k you're only looking at $900 profit.

Bruh that's too vague my man. Read the sidebar on desktop, and hit up Coinbase.com/set up your account and all the security measures you can. Then set up thru gdax (Coinbase exchange, same user info but a better platform to buy from) and go from there. A good YouTube is some guy called crypto bobby I think, or something like that. Bitcoin has been pushing an all time high for the past 3-4 months now, and expect days with +-10% fluctuations. My advice is to buy a good chunk, store it on a locally installed wallet like electrum, and forget about it for 5-10 years or longer. Hope that's enough to get you started.

I'm thinking people's funds are finally available from when it took off 4-5 days ago lol but I have no clue. Fucking wild
