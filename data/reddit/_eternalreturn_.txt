If they're not wash trading on no-fee exchanges, then those are valid prices.   
I don't agree with their rationale, if it just consists of "prices in this country are higher, so we're going to eliminate them".

No, his comments aren't why BCash 'jumped' today.  
Following their MO, when BTC difficulty adjusts, Roger and Jihan pump bcash, then once it gets to a satisfactory level, they'll dump, lining their pockets, and fleecing the rubes that actually believe their bullshit.

If you can make the majority of your payments via LN, where they are confirmed instantly for a satoshi or two, then you're likely to use that for a large percentage of use-cases, rather than doing them on the L1 blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:32:19

No, you don't (not that it matters).  I doubt you hold any appreciable amount.  Probably less than 1btc
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:40:31
*Bcash  
The Bcash tokens are still at the pre-August 1 address on the Bcash chain.  
Assuming that you still have the private key, you can send the Bcash from your wallet to an exchange, trade them for bitcoin, and then send the bitcoin to your new bitcoin address.  
I haven't heard of any exchanges that limit the number of Bcash tokens that you can sell per day.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:42
Sure.  
You may not make returns like people who got in years ago have made, but how would you like that $10 to be worth $20 or $30 in a year?  
$10/week is likely an amount that you can do without, and not have it hurt too much if it goes down, so if that's the case, go for it.

BCash literally has nothing to offer right now.

No, part of the point of sidechains is to take certain kinds of transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain until they need to be settled.  
This is done in various ways, depending on the sidechain.

"good" is the tricky part.  
Bittrex is what I've used the most for shitcoin trading, but I heard that they recently hugely lowered their daily withdrawal limits.  
Poloniex has always had laughably low daily withdrawal limits.  
Kraken is borderline unusable as a platform.

Fees on LN are basically dust, so most transactions will happen there, including those of the 'unbanked'.  
This majority offloading of transactions to LN will free up space on the L1 blockchain, and make fees far lower there as well.

Write to your wallet/exchange and let them know that you want them to enable SegWit.  
They probably won't though, because they're beholden to their paymasters (Roger/Jihan), so we'll have to wait for the alternatives currently in the works to go live so that they can be put out of business.

shitcoins are still shitcoins, even if bad actors start using their platforms to pump them.  
The fees are largely artificial, and are made worse _by these very services_, because they massively inflate the fees that they make their users pay.

I buy btc and then turn around and buy what I want with the btc that I just purchased, leaving my hoard untouched.  
I use btc instead of credit cards, because it's actaually easier than using credit cards (IMO, via coinbase), and I don't want the people responsible for security at a lot of these places leaking my cc info due to incompetence.  
Also, because I do have a vested interest in seeing btc succeed, and that vested interest is not _purely_ selfish. Sure, I would see a significant change to my lifestyle if btc took off hugely, but that's not the real motivating factor for my desire to see it succeed. The motivating factor is the technology behind the currency, and my opinion that it has the potential to change how we are able to use money on every level, from interpersonal to international.  I want there to be a day that I can travel from north america, to europe, to asia, and never have to fuck around with figuring out exchange rates, and going through the hassle and expense of changing currencies into dumb paper and metal.

The Trust currently expects that there will be at least 100,000 Shares outstanding

The Exchange is proposing to replace that sentence with the following text:  
There will be at least 500,000 Shares outstanding at the time of commencement of

@_date: 2017-03-15 15:42:58
If we can get SegWit and LN enabled, then this charge will likely disappear again (or become negligible) for a large number of transactions.  
Say you're buying from some retailer from your coinbase account.  Decent sized retailers will likely be in a LN chain with coinbase, and the transaction can happen off-chain between CB (your account) and the retailer.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:57:28
That's already an issue.  It's not specific to LN implementations.  
Besides, it wouldn't do them any good, because you could just go through some other LN channel to transfer funds if they were engaged in fuckery.

maybe not.  
As an business, exchange, or wallet you have to make decisions based on the information you have.  
When the majority of the users who have an opinion, and state it, agree with all the developers actually working on the software, and with the overwhelming majority of nodes (which don't have a vested interest in either side), then the course is clear.  
Those users who currently don't know will probably not notice or care initially.  
They would notice and care though if BU took over, and their coins became worthless due to the shit code that BU produces coupled with bad decisions made by miners or those who control them.

Further, if they try to 51% the _real_ BTC network, there will be a PoW fork, which will ensure that they _can't_ return, which is their worst nightmare.  They'll be stuck with a worthless shitcoin, and their ASICs won't be able to mine BTC anymore.

I just happened to get your response, and saw his, seemingly immediately after he wrote it.  
I _do_ want to have accurate information about which nodes are SegWit-capable, and which are BU-capable, as I think that is actually the best indicator of what the community wants.  
Looking at miners is about the worst way that you could measure community sentiment about SegWit vs. BU, since mining has become a hegemony controlled by a small group of well-funded, self-interested miners, who are looking to increase their ROI, not bitcoin's utility.  
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:59:44
If your transaction with a low fee is competing with a transaction with higher fees now, you're going to be out of luck.  
Further, with more payments happening in payment channels, combined with the effective blocksize increase SegWit delivers, the likelihood of that kind of competition decreases.   
There simply _IS NOT_ a way to scale bitcoin on-chain.  
If you don't understand this, you're don't understand the problem.

Bitcoin isn't broken.  The problem is _who_ those two people are, and what they're doing.

The same thing as any other traded instrument or currency, what people are willing to pay for it.  
It sounds trite, but it's the truth.  
Now, what kinds of things might compel a person to be willing to value bitcoin highly?  
A desire to hedge against inflation, its technological underpinnings, its decentralized nature, the privacy it offers, the security it offers, etc.  
Different people will value these properties differently, and thus be willing to pay more or less for bitcoin.

It's an untenable solution to the scaling problem.  A problem which cunts like Jihan Wu and Roger Ver exacerbate by mining empty blocks and spamming the mempool.

The hostile miners would be replaced.  Not necessarily immediately, but the hashrate without them would still be plenty healthy.  
Yes, I think most people running nodes will refuse big blocks, and when BUTT miners realize that they're mining virtually worthless trinkets, they'll start mining bitcoin again.  
Hopefully after they do, they'll shut the fuck up and let the developers develop the code that prints their money.

I used to like Roger Ver, but he has become a cancer.  
I believe at first, the problem was just that he was too dumb to understand he problems in BU, but since the dev community, and most of reddit, rejected his proposal, his butthurt became unbearable, and now he's a bad actor.

A short-term drop of $100 or less from people who bought specifically anticipating approval getting out of their positions would be understandable, but again, nothing will have actually changed in the technology.

No they won't, because the _overwhelming_ (97%) majority of nodes will reject BU blocks.  Wallets aren't going to be flocking to hashrate that shits out invalid blocks that almost all nodes reject.

When it hits $1300, that will be my line to you.  
On the other hand, as I mentioned, all my BTC holdings are pure profit at this point, so if it were to drop to $1050, I would just continue to wait it out, as I did when I dropped to &lt; $300 after Gox.  
You, on the other hand will continue to see the profits you left on the table grow and grow.  
This, coupled with all the other failures in your life (too numerous to count) will drive you into a spiral of depression and self-loathing that you cannot (and should not) recover from.

Seriously though, I had people ask me those questions at $300, $500, $700, $900, etc.  
If this rule change is approved by the SEC, making way for the ETF to open, I expect both BTC and Ethereum to go way up.  
If not, I expect them both to go down significantly, but briefly, and then start to climb again.  
Even if the rule change is denied, I think we'll be over $1200 again before summer.

This is not an apt analogy.  
You could mine and mine and cost yourself quite a bit in hardware and electricity costs, but never mine a block.  
You could start a hub for very little (on existing hardware), and use it as you see fit.

Creating hubs is not.

BUTTs (Bitcoin Unlimited Temporary Tokens) will be worth $0.05 briefly.  They will quickly drop to being worth effectively nothing.  
2 months later, BTC will be $1300.  
2 months after that, it will be $2000.  
You can thank me later.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:04:41
I believe that the price is going up now because typically in the event of a rejection, the SEC notifies the submitter in advance so that they can withdraw the proposal, rather than have the SEC reject it.  
This almost always happens a few days prior to the decision deadline.  The closer we get to the actual deadline without hearing from either party (SEC or BATS/Winks), the more likely approval becomes in the bulls' opinion.  
I happen to think that this line of reasoning is correct, but time will tell.

The cause (their coup of bitcoin) is not fake.  Their claim to be running BU is fake.  
They want to entice other miners to switch so that once there are enough who have, they can also _actually_ start running BU as well, and stage that hostile takeover.  
If they spin off now, they have no chance of success.  
What these hostile miners fail to understand is that even if they do wait for 51% of miners to join them, without the _nodes_ also running BU (which they won't), they're just running expensive heaters, whose BUTTs will be rejected by the actual  network.

Ultimately, the mining cabals are driven by greed.  They don't want to be spending money to mine blocks that will be [rejected by 97% of the network]( so they'll cry and scream, and call everyone else stupid, and they'll even fool some rubes on the sad side of the bell curve, but they won't fork.

Definitely going to need a source for that claim.  Even if true, the developers would know what's best for the maintenance of the software, not a cabal of Chinese business fucks who just want to milk someone else's work for every penny they can squeeze out of it.  


So?  They've gotten more than their money back.  If they never got a dime back my answer would be the same.  No one forced them to mine, and I think we would all be better off without them.  


Bullshit.  They've made tons of profit off of mining.  They'll just switch to some alt (basically what they're trying to do now is to spinoff an alt that more greatly benefits them at the cost of the health of the network itself) and continue mining.  


They can shove their investment up their ass with a razor blade.  I could give a flying fuck about them and their investment.  What I care about is the health of the Bitcoin software and network.  Everyone who shares those concerns is opposing BU.

@_date: 2017-03-20 14:29:28


This is a completely damning admission.  If this translation is accurate, then he's clearly stating that the miners want to activate BU, and to block SegWit, _not because BU is a technically superior solution for scaling, but to maximize transaction fees for miners (to the detriment of users)_.  
With this admission in hand, there should be nobody who isn't a large-scale miner supporting this assclown or his proposal.

I doubt it.  I was around on a day we saw a $300+ drop.  Denial of the ETF shouldn't effect the sentiment in Japan, India, South America, etc, and doesn't mean that the other ETFs also currently in process will be denied, that this one won't just be re-submitted yet again, or that we should expect any restrictive regulations on BTC in the US.

I think that the pool of BTC users making up the network will make that kind of attack financially unfeasible.  
_Could_ some large company attack the network in the way you're suggesting?  Maybe.  But if they were that motivated and had such deep pockets, they could do so now.  
Besides, all they would get out of it is that they would seriously damage bitcoin.  
The idea of digital currency is part of the zeitgeist now.  You can't put that cat back in the bag.  So, they would be burning half a billion dollars, for basically no gain.

You wouldn't don't have to go through intermediary payment channels to send funds to recipients.  You might choose to because it's convenient, but it wouldn't be _required_.    
There will still be a place for on-chain transactions, so you won't be forced to 'lock your coins in payment channels (not segwit addresses)'.   
SegWit will make the effective block size twice what it is now, for those occasions where payment channels aren't optimal.

For the ones that matter, it's neither.  If SegWit activates, we get LN soon thereafter, and _that_ is what they want to avoid at all costs.  This is their stopgap to prevent LN, and preserve and increase _their_ profits at the expense of the _entire bitcoin userbase_.

Why?  I've got enormous profits, and your underwater as fuck.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:53:20
The problem is that they're delusional.  
They want to essentially become the governing body and controlling mint of bitcoin.  
This is why nodes absolutely _will not_ start running BU.  Because doing so would be giving the game away to the malicious miners.  They _would_ actually win in that scenario.  
I'm not sure how to make what they're doing to try to coerce other miners to signal BU any more clear than I have, or how you're not understanding it.  And I don't mean that as an insult.  I'm just not sure what to say that wouldn't amount to repeating myself.  
They actually think that the following scenario will play out:  
They fake-signal BU.  
Other smaller pools see that they have signaled BU and follow suit.   
Once enough small pools have switched that the malicious miners running BU would _actually_ constitute a majority of hash power, they malicious miners begin _actually_ running BU, under the assumption that since 51%+ of hashpower is producing BU blocks, nodes will also switch.  
The nodes switch until a majority of nodes also run BU, and now the malicious miners have control, and can decide on block size and control fees.  
This scenario will never play out in reality though, because nodes will not accept this kind of obvious, naked power grab.
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:58:40

Ridiculous.  Pools of smaller-scale miners who have been pushed out because they can't compete with the BitMain monopoly will start mining again, and the entire network will be safer, because it won't have hostile cunts with the hash power to delude themselves into thinking that they can stage a coup holding back the technology.

Once the Lightning Network is active on Bitcoin mainnet and _real_ bitcoin, even in dust amounts, can be transacted with instantaneously at fees totaling a few satoshis, their arguments will be completely exposed as empty rhetoric, and their shitcoin's value will drop off a goddamn cliff.  
LN activation on mainnet will be a watershed moment for Bitcoin.  It is at _this_ point that major retailers can start using it _en masse_ without hosing the network with their throughput.  
And BCash will **never** have it.

It's always safer for you to hold the keys to your coins than to allow some custodian to hold them for you, so unless you have a reason to keep the coins on the exchange, you should send them to your hardware wallet as soon as you can.  
Once you have the bitcoin on the exchange, you should be able to see your balance, and withdraw it.  
You will need to go into your hardware wallet's UI, and get a receive address.  You then paste that receive address in on the exchange as the destination for the withdrawal.  
Hardware wallets already have a number of addresses on them, which are deterministically derived from the passphrase that you will need to write down when you're doing your wallet setup.  This also means that if you ever lose your hardware wallet, your funds can still be accessed from any other hardware wallet (or web/mobile wallet) that supports BIP44/39.

and those, mostly 'fake'.  
When I say fake, I mean they're not organic.  They're a result of Bitmain only accepting BCash for the new Antminer line.  
This was done for 2 reasons:  
1) Trading volume: it gives the false impression that lots of people are _actually interested_ in trading BCash, when in truth, they're coerced to in order to buy the miners.  
2) Transaction volume: it gives the false impression that people are actually transacting on the BCash blockchain of their own accord, and not _solely_ to get mining hardware.  
If it weren't for Bitmain employing this ploy, BCash would be even more of a ghost town than it already is.

The Ledger Nano S is an HD wallet, so when you get it, it will walk you through the setup process, where it shows you a series of 24 words (your seed, from which your addresses are derived) that you will write down in case you ever need to restore because your device was lost or broken.  Once you have completed setup, and installed the chrome plugin for the wallet UI, you can access your wallet.  
The wallet's private key is never exposed to your computer.  
There _is_ a virus which works by changing bitcoin addresses that you copy to your clipboard to the hacker's bitcoin address, so when you copypaste your receive address from the Ledger app to the exchange to complete the transfer from exchange -&gt; Ledger, just doublecheck that the address is correct.  
Once your funds are on the Ledger, you're set.  Make sure you store your passphrase/seed words in a safe place.

I don't like the title of the article at all (and be prepared for people to intentionally take it out of context).  
I think that we _should_ stop talking about Bitcoin Core, and just refer to it as Bitcoin.  There's no reason to add the 'Core' modifier.  Using it only plays into BU's attempt at framing the issue.  
It's just bitcoin.  
Removing 'Core' would make it all the more obvious in a subtle, subconscious way, that BU is an offshoot and a scam, rather than a peer and competitor.

If you'll allow me to tweak your analogy a bit:  
Imagine traincars (blocks) carrying cargo (transaction data) between cities (clients).  There are many weigh stations (nodes) between these cities with limits on the amount of cargo allowed per traincar.   
Some bad-acting traincar manufacturer decides that he wants to increase his profits by making larger traincars that carry more cargo, so he starts building them, claiming that since he's shipping the cargo, he makes the rules.  
However, when his traincars make it to the weigh stations, and are found to be over capacity, the floor drops out from under them and they fall into a volcano.  
The weigh station operators shake their heads at the stupidity of the traincar manufacturer, and go back to waiting for the next traincar to roll onto the scale.

Here's the missing addendum to my analogy:  
While this bad-acting train manufacturer is building his oversize cars, the railroad collective (Core developers) has been working on a new technology that will allow 2-4 times the amount of cargo onto existing traincars in a way that won't put them over the weight limit (SegWit).  Imagine a kind of portal that shrinks the cargo as it goes into the traincar.  Along with that they're also working on an alternate system for moving cargo between distribution hubs at incredible speed using flying drones at huge savings to the consumers (Lightning Network).

It is certainly distressing that Coinbase is adamant in its support of 2x.  However, it's misleading to say


It would be more accurate to say  


Still problematic, but far less so, and with significant implications.  
People in India, Japan, Europe, throughout South America, etc are not using coinbase, and post 2x will likely continue using bitcoin, rather than the new 2x HF token.  This will mean that coinbase users are buying into a different token than everyone else, and will not only cause massive confusion, but also open Coinbase to **massive** liability if they list this token as bitcoin, which they do not want, and could literally sink them.  
Futher, [only 2% of nodes are running btc1]( so blocks built on btc1 will be overwhelmingly rejected by the network.  Coinbase hitching their horse to that wagon would be completely insane.  
If bitcoin were a strictly American phenomenon, bitcoin could be in for some trouble, but because of the global scope it has broadened to, coinbase is not able to dictate the chain that _is_ bitcoin, and selling altcoin tokens under the guise of them being bitcoin is outright fraud.

Except that they'll reject invalid blocks, so they won't propagate.  
After a halvening, some miners tried to continue to mine blocks with the previous reward, and nodes were responsible for rejecting those invalid blocks.  
The same is true here.  
Miners can attempt whatever fuckery they want, but nodes (read: users) will keep them honest.

Over the last 5 years in bitcoin, when this shit happens, what is most amazing to me is the impression that I get every time that the Chinese can't even understand their own language.

Support for it was wavering, but in the aftermath of the breaking bitcoin conference, it's really crumbling.   
A number of miners/pools have 'clarified' their positions with comments like: 'our support was only valid until July 1', or 'in the event of 2 chains, we feel no obligation to mine the 2x chain.'  
Further, comments from many Core developers have shown that they will not develop on the 2x chain, making it nothing more than a poor patchset of the real bitcoin.  
Finally, exchanges will not want to open themselves to the massive liability of listing bitcoin, when they're supporting an alt.  The lawsuits would be swift and catastrophic.  
Erik Voorhees is desperately trying to keep it together (for no conceivable good reason), but is failing, fortunately.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:44:31
Let me be perfectly, unambiguously clear about this.  
If coinbase does switch to the 2x token and claim that it is bitcoin, I will personally buy from them, and then sue them for fraud, and I know many others IRL who are planning to do the same.  
I urge others here to also consider this approach.  
If Coinbase is willing to threaten bitcoin in this way, they have to be made to feel the pain in the only way that matters to them: financially.

It needs to be presented for discussion and evaluation on the open forums currently used to make protocol changes, and then coded and vetted by sufficient, rigorous testing such that its implementation on mainnet doesn't constitute a colossally unacceptable level of risk on a multi-billion dollar network.  
This is the current methodology and anyone is free to make BIP proposals.

Because parties with conflicting interests to bitcoin's were able to game the system (BIP9) to prevent an improvement that, while better for bitcoin and its users, broke their profitable attack on the network, which is precisely my point.  
BIP9 will never again be used because of this.  
The BIP148 UASF broke that stalemate.  


I want to make this completely clear, so let me state it plainly: fuck their feelings.  


Yeah, apparently as a group they think it's advisable to implement changes that actually improve the protocol through a mechanism of rigorous testing. Crazy, that.  


I find it very easy.  Their companies are the remoras of the crypto space, latching onto and leeching money from the people doing the actual work, and I couldn't give a single fuck what happens to a single one of them.  What matters to me is that bitcoin remains stable, implements changes that actually improve the protocol, remains decentralized, and is not controlled by entities with orthogonal interests.

Because if miners mine invalid blocks, those blocks will be rejected by the bitcoin network (nodes).  
Miners are responsible for ordering transactions into blocks, and putting those blocks into the blockchain, _not_ dictating or enforcing consensus rules.  If they put invalid blocks in the blockchain, the network (which _is_ responsible for enforcing consensus rules) will reject them.  
This has happened before.

He has been told this very thing by me, and many others across various media.

Speaking for myself  
I am against this 2x HF because the mechanism to implement protocol changes in bitcoin _cannot_ be that a group of CEOs in the Marriott decided that they want the protocol to be such-and-such.  
Their incentives don't necessarily align with (and could often be diametrically opposed to) the good of bitcoin itself and its users.  
Let me be frank: If bitcoin can be changed in this way, _it has failed_.  
Not only is the protocol change mechanism opposite to the underlying ideology of bitcoin (money independent of large special interests, controlled instead by the users), but the change proposed is not currently necessary or wise.  
The mempool is very low when not being spammed by bad actors like Roger and Jihan (_who are signatories to the NYA_, let's not forget) and 5-10 sat/byte transactions clear easily.  Sub-5 sat/byte transactions clear in a reasonable amount of time, and are usable if you're not in a hurry.  SegWit is around 5% adoption right now, and when other signatories (looking at you Erik Voorhees) get their shit together and implement it, the adoption will be much higher, and more space will be available for transactions in each block.  
Once that happens, and we see how widespread SegWit usage effects the mempool, an evaluation can be made as to when and if a 4-8Mb (which is what they're _actually_ proposing) HF is actually necessary.  
Before that happens, though, further enhancements/optimizations that are currently in the works (Schnorr,  sidechains, LN) may be implemented and push out the necessity for the crude, blunt instrument of a HF for base size increase even further.  
What makes absolutely _no_ sense is to blindly, dumbly, and in the face of contrary evidence, adhere to an agreement that was clearly made in bad faith by many of the signatories who almost immediately violated the spirit of the agreement (BCash) rendering it null and void because "muh word".

Requiring "strong replay protection" means you understand that your fork is _highly_ contentious (15% support appears to be the neighborhood) and _will inevitably result in a chain split_, and you're not so monumentally irresponsible as to put a $90+ billion network at risk, and actually give a shit about the fact that if you don't implement it, many users are guaranteed to lose money that was entrusted to your business.

Part of the reason for this rally is that confidence is coming back into the market because:

2) btc1 (the 2x repo) is an utter embarrassment that wouldn't be acceptable at a dog-and-pony show startup, suggesting that it won't actually be run by signatories.  
3) Futures markets for 2x look very similar to what we saw for BCash, demonstrating that the 2x claims of broad consensus were (what we all knew all along) utter fabrication.

Advantage of USDT in crypto-only exchange:
1. Used to stabilize the value of your assets. You can exchange digital assets to USDT to avoid the losses in a plummet market.
2. Easy to know the price of digital asset. Because 1USDT is equal to 1USD, the price of digital asset against USDT is the USD price of the digital asset.
3. Superior liquidity. Transactions of USDT is based on the Bitcoin blockchain which is stable and reliable.
Additional Resource:

It's not an upgrade.  
1) It's not the result of technical necessity, but a forced deal orchestrated by a group of would-be oligarchs who don't represent the community.  
2) It seeks to remove the group of developers with a longstanding reputation for quality and integrity, and place development in the hands of a bumbling buffoon who will make changes at the behest of the aforementioned would-be oligarchs  
3) The btc1 repo that bizcoin/2x would be running on is a hacked together shitpile of Garzik rebasing in core, and adding ugly hacks.  
4) Camouflaging nodes is indefensibly egregious and an outright attack.  
5) No replay protection is tremendously dangerous.  
6) There hasn't been nearly enough time for testing  
7) The proposal is highly contentious  
Futures markets bear out that the community values bizcoin/2x at 1/4 the value of bitcoin.  
Many signatories are leaving, or treating bizcoin/2x as what it is: an alt
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:40:23
Because 2x tokens are getting their shit pushed in, providing _yet more_ evidence that the NYA is not only contentious, but widely disapproved of by actual users.  
This leads to the conclusion that with this data point (in addition to _all_ the other reasons not to follow through with the NYA) more and more signatories will drop out, and the fork will either not happen (unlikely), or just be free tokens for people to dump and increase their bitcoin position.

Users determine the value.  
Miners follow the value that users have determined.  
Exchanges are a service used by users, and if an exchange no longer supports the coin they want to buy, they will take their business elsewhere, to an exchange where they can get it.  
Miners and exchanges are businesses that have costs.  
It costs me nothing to hold.  
I can wait as long as it takes.  
And, if the miners really want to fuck around, we can change the PoW and brick all their hardware.  
I'm pretty receptive to a PoW change myself, since it will almost certainly have to happen at some point, and now would be less disruptive than some point in the future, and an algorithm can be chosen that's more conducive to decentralization in mining (ASIC resistance) so that these cunts can't try another coup attempt like this again.

I used to think the same thing about Erik, but his motivations are looking more and more sinister with his continued refusal to budge on this, even in the face of all the reasons not to follow through:   
* Agreement signed in bad faith by may signatories  
* The most vocal and insistent 2x HF signatories almost immediately reneged (BCash)  
* The existence of BCash obviates the need for the HF in bitcoin, because users wanting larger blocks  (and miners wanting to continue using ASICBoost) got their chain  
* Basically the entire core development team will not work on the 2x corp-coin chain  
* Jeff Garzik (_the_ developer on btc1) hasn't done fuckall in months, other than patch in the work of the developers actually writing quality code in the core repo.   
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:37:36
Despite the fact that you're a whining twat, I'll do you the favor of replying:  
bizcoin/2x is an attack on bitcoin. It seeks to change the method of determining protocol changes from proposals submitted to, and reviewed by the technical experts in the open source community, to the whims of a small group of CEOs whose business models don't necessarily align with bitcoin or bitcoin users' best interests.  
Miners can feel free to mine on the bizcoin/2x chain if they so choose, just as they can choose to mine on the BCash chain, or Classic, or XT, or any other hard fork shitcoin chain.  They're welcome to do so, but if they do, they are no longer mining bitcoin.  The futures markets are showing in no uncertain terms that bizcoin/2x has about 1/4 the value of bitcoin, so I don't expect many miners are going to waste their time and energy on a low-value alternative.
Why should we oppose the bizcoin/2x takeover attempt?  In addition to the reason already given above, there is also:    
1) It seeks to remove the group of developers with a longstanding reputation for quality and integrity, and place development in the hands of a bumbling buffoon who will make changes at the behest of the aforementioned would-be oligarchs  
2) The btc1 repo that 2x would be running on is a hacked together shitpile of Garzik rebasing in core, and adding ugly hacks.  
3) Camouflaging nodes is indefensibly egregious and an outright attack.  
4) No replay protection is tremendously dangerous.  
5) There hasn't been nearly enough time for testing  `
5) The proposal is highly contentious

2) The number of confirmations the exchange requires before the funds are available for trade.  Check your exchange to find out the answer to this.  
As a _very_ rough estimate, 30-60 minutes

No way.  
The 4mb chain is the least strict, its blocks would be rejected by _both_ other chains.  On the other hand, BIP148 UASF blocks would be accepted by both other chains.

What said is why I will never use BitPay again, and with all the interest in crypto that I'm seeing from my friends lately, many of whom are owners of small-medium sized businesses, I'm going to be recommending they use alternatives to your service as well.  
It's more than obvious what the Bitcoin userbase wants here, and it's just as obvious that Jihan Wu is harming the entire bitcoin ecosystem for his own personal gain, and anyone and everyone complicit in his maintaining his ASICboost attack on the bitcoin network, and his prevention of scaling progress in the form of SegWit implementation will be held accountable by the bitcoin community.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:44:51
If ASICboost were killed, then we would have SegWit via MASF very quickly, and the need for UASF would be rendered moot, but at this point, UASF is likely the best solution, if for no other reason than as an exercise, and to demonstrate unequivocally that we, the users, will not allow progress to be held hostage by a malicious miner.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:57:54
At this point, we (users) are forced with weighing the risk of the scenarios before us.  Many of us have arrived at the conclusion that the lesser risk lies with supporting BIP148 UASF, and the greater risk lies with inaction, allowing more time for Jihan/Bitmain to consolidate his stranglehold over more mining pools and ecosystem businesses to further his obvious goal of becoming the arbiter of bitcoin as a whole.  
Core's inaction (and I say this with 6 years of reliance on their technical expertise, and a great deal of respect for the technical skills you all have) has only emboldened him, and provided him more time to scheme and bribe.  
Bitcoin progress _can not_ be held hostage in this way by one selfish interest, or it has failed.  
We, as a community, have tried to do this in other ways, but all interactions with Jihan/Bitmain over the last 2 years have been done in bad faith on their part, because until recently we didn't know (thanks, by the way for this) that he never had any intention of actually supporting any proposition that would negate the covert ASICboost exploit that he has been using to enrich himself at the cost of the ecosystem's health.

Bullshit.  He could start signalling today if he really wanted SegWit.  This 'agreement' is an obvious stalling tactic.  


All miners who are not signalling for SegWit now.  


Even when one side created an elegant solution that provides even more and better solutions on the horizon, and the other side blocks it so they can continue to attack the network?  Yes, it fucking matters.  
Here's the problem with Vinny and the rest of the shitbirds that signed that agreement: 


They think these big companies make and drive what bitcoin is.  They don't.  Users do.  They think that ecosystem changes can be dictated from boardrooms by a committee of oligarchs.  It can't, because the actual users will give them a big 'fuck you' in the form of the UASF that's coming on August 1, which they're more than welcome to join, but they need to divest themselves of the erroneous notion that they get to decide how bitcoin works for the people who actually use it.

It seems to me that this UASF is a step in that direction.  Right now, the system is _completely_ vulnerable to negligent and malicious miners, and if UASF succeeds, then the foundational reason for Jihan's opposition to SegWit (namely, that it would prevent his covert ASICboost attack) will be nullified, and we can get the rest of the upgrades that we're all looking forward to, while Core can simultaneously work on new BIPs that can further prevent subsequent instances of Miner-veto like the one we have been languishing under for the last 2 years.

Segwit is already an effective blocksize increase.  The +2Mb is superfluous and an unnecessary strain on the network.  


I don't need to listen to the same flawed arguments for technically inferior approaches that _aren't even_ solutions from people who are actively attacking the bitcoin network, selling hardware with landmines in them, and propagandizing with lies and disinformation, and nor will we ever compromise on the fundamental security of the network, which those who are opposing SegWit are weakening.

Bitmain is acting irrationally if their goal is a higher Bitcoin price as denominated in the fiat currency of your choice, or if their goal is the long-term success of bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless currency.  
They're acting rationally if their goal is to take control of bitcoin, make it into a centralized PayPal 2.0 which they control, and change the rules of the network to whatever they want, either because all they care about is accumulating fiat or because they're being directed to do so by their oppressive government.

Yes, it will be the chain that's not overtly, obviously controlled by a mining cartel loathed by 90%+ of users.  It will be the bitcoin chain (finally with SegWit, no thanks to them) that succeeds, not the BitmainCoin chain that is centralized and retardedly 'scaled'.

Many of us are not willing to accept this any more, and have thrown our support behind an initiative called BIP148 UASF.

Yet others have hardware online now that they'll switch over once the UASF activates.

They didn't do it by continually increasing the diameter of copper wires. That would be retardedly inefficient, as is gross blocksize increase, when better alternatives that affect higher throughput via efficiency improvements are available, and not only available, they open the door to yet more efficiency improvements that could get bitcoin to Visa-scale.  
Dumbly increasing blocksize leads to node centralization.  
Those centralized nodes will be controlled by large financial interests, most of which will likely be the very mining cartels that have centralized mining and caused this situation in the first place.  
If mining and nodes are both centralized, and controlled by the same parties, then bitcoin has utterly failed.

Core is most interested in ensuring the highest standards in code quality and security for the bitcoin Network.  
SegWit isn't 'interested' in anything.  It's a change that involves moving where the witness data is located in a block.  This fixes transaction malleability, and also frees up more space in the block for transactions.  SegWit also removes the block size limit, and replaces it with weight.  More available space in the block lowers transaction fees, as more transactions can be fit into blocks.

Looking more credible, but let's wait for the close before making a final call.

That makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:50:17
Actually, the developers who _actually work on the software_ decide on what the better solution is.  
And they have.  
SegWit.  
Stop embarrassing yourself, shitbird.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:16:04
Keep upping the blocksize, duh!  
Bitcoin is still totally decentralized, there are like 10 companies running node server farms!  
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:14:40


This is so idiotically wrong, that all you've done here is tell everyone you either have no idea what you're talking about, or you're a shill.  I know which I think.  
EDIT: Also, let me just mention that [without SegWit, a 2 MB block could literally have taken several hours to verify (exponentially increasing with size).](
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:29:09
But the majority of shills have very new accounts.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:49:41
No, but it does widen exposure to those who don't already know.  
How else do you think information is distributed?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:31:36
It is absolutely greed.  
1) SegWit as a soft-fork (MASF or UASF) will disable covert ASICboost, eliminating Jihan Wu's current attack on the bitcoin network which has allowed him to amass the majority of hash power under himself and his cronies/proxies.  
2) SegWit will make transactions _in the words of Jihan Wu_ 'unfairly cheap' which is obviously in the interests of all users.  
Shill somewhere else.

This is complete and total fud, by a 0 day account.  Reported.

Where's my blood, OP?  
When will the price be down to the low levels of the left shoulder (sub $2400)?  
I was promised blood...
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:05:15
Those exchanges will support this proposal in order to get SegWit activated.  
When btc1 never gets merged into the core repo, and they want to up the blocksize on a repo no one is _actually_ using, which codebase do you think exchanges will run?


It feels absolutely nothing like that.  It feels like UASF forced the malicious miners to do what they should have a year ago, and what they wouldn't have done without its threat looming.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:43:36
But the people who do have come to the conclusion that Vortex described in that tweet.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:41:06
Good on you for doing this.  
While I've got you here, will your pool be supporting BIP148 UASF, or at least providing an option for miners in your pool to mine it specifically (a la SlushPool)?  
EDIT:  Oops!  I didn't realize when writing this that BTC.com is a slave of Jihan.  Disregard my question!
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:01:49
No, it doesn't.   
That nuclear option isn't yet necessary, and hopefully won't become so.

Bitpay have whored themselves completely to Bitmain, so no.  
Coinbase hasn't commented.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:21:01
No, it looks very bullish by every indicator I care about.
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:11:29
Jihan won't give a shit. He's a complete egoist and egotist.  
Roger, on the other hand, I believe to just be a goober whose feelings were hurt, and who has been misled and used by those who see his notoriety in the community as useful.  This is the kind of thing that I think would actually get to him if he didn't avoid it because of the cognitive dissonance it would cause.
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:10:33
Very cool.  
How would you characterize the noise level?
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:43:12


No, they won't, because they won't have nearly enough nodes willing to enforce.  
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:38:57
Yes, if 'squares' is a euphemism for 'obvious hostile takeover attempts' and 'circles' is a euphemism for 'elegant scaling solutions which fix vulerabilities, prevent attacks, and open the door to more scaling and usability innovations.'  
Then yes.
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:26:53
Nope, you don't.
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:01:00
Gross blocksize increase is not a solution to scaling.

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:26:08


 
Bullshit.  There's sufficient evidence that no unbiased party could be aware of and draw any conclusion other than that it was and is being used.  


More bullshit.  A vague and ambiguous statement about 'working with patent owners' is less than worthless.  


Covert ASICboost is an attack on the network where the attacker is forging work not actually done, and results in centralization because other miners aren't able to compete, because they're not also using this attack.  
GTFO, you lying shit.
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:24:20


There probably will, but that there shouldn't be wasn't my argument. 


You didn't actually disagree though...

If you're talking about finding the private key to match a public key, it would actually take a computer the size of the sun, operating at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero far, _far_ longer than the life of the universe to do so.

If it was a blockchain.info wallet, look back through whatever email account you were using at the time.  Blockchain.info should have sent you an email with your credentials in it.  You may even have backed up your wallet file to email.
