Hello Electrodraco,
A clear sign: We have our blog at  that is shared with our facebook followers but the majority of our business comes from new customers because locksmithing isn't something people realise they need until they're locked out! How could we give our potential customers a clear sign we use bitcoins? 
Advertising: To touch on Demotruck's point. Do you think that our business would be able to use accepting bitcoin to gain positive PR that could lead to extra sales, even if those sales aren't in bitcoin until the point that it starts to take off. If so is there any suggestions you the Reddit Bitcoin Community have to gain PR?
I think if we could gain a decent level of exposure I could justify investing the time into setting bitcoin acceptance up and learning the basics even though there's the risk of not gaining any sales from the investment. 
Understanding: This is a very fair point, that's some good advice from an Economics Student! Well done, I hadn't thought of it that way. I think my colleague who is interested in bitcoins will be able to teach me the basics and I could have him on call for any basic technical questions I'm having trouble with.
Terms and conditions: My main reason for the terms and conditions is non payment which I take to a small claims court (often just out of principle). You state that no charge back is possible, could you expand on this?
Thank you for your time and sorry I don't know how to do quotes!

Hi Demoturk, thank you for the advice and the bits! 
How likely is bitcoin to take off? 
I've google searched, locksmith in sussex that accepts bitcoin, and there doesn't seem to be any others that accept it. Would I gain anything by being the first locksmith in the Sussex area to accept bitcoin? 
Sidequestion - is a bits a bit of a bitcoin?

This a good point that we'd definitely over looked in the past. I would say it's not true for everyone though because a fair few people have admitted to owning crypto over the years while I've been on a job.

Yes I guess it is free advertising for both Bitcoin and ourselves. Free in a money sense anyway, we've put a decent amount of time into research.

No we don't offer any discount when paying with Bitcoin at the moment. We think it would probably ad more confusion than it's worth passing the cost saving on from the card company.
Thanks for the added advice

Thanks for the kind words and support. It's good to know the community is interested in these sort of posts, we will endeavour to write on Reddit more often than once every four years.

I don't understand this comment, could you elaborate? 
Why would either of these points be the case?

Oh that's a shame, it looks like a really good website. Is there not even anyone sorting through submissions? There could be 100s of businesses now accepting Bitcoin in Brighton.
Thanks for getting back to me pokerplayer
