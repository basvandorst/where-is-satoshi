Yea, gold doesn’t really have any inherent value. I feel like the only reason that gold is what it is is because it is shiny. As stupid as that sounds lol. Gold isn’t really used as a transactional medium either. I guess bitcoin is kind of like gold? ��

You think BTC will be a hedge against the global market? Kind of like gold?

I interpreted your comment in the following way, using football as an example.
“What is the new head coach going to do with his new team?”
And the you said something like “Whatever it takes to win games. Whether that’s focus on the passing game or defense or whatever”
So it’s just so pointless what you said. I don’t know, there was no reason to be a dick to you. I don’t even know why I commented.

It’s hopeless bro, these people are beyond reason.

Sorry for being an ass. I just felt like you were staying the obvious. Why would anyone ever invest with morals? Not just Wall Street, but everyone is going to do what makes me them the most money.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:17:42
That makes more sense and is a good point. There really is no way to know what “Wall Street” will do.

Any proof?

So just speculation then, no proof. Got it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:08:27
What great insight there.

I don’t get why bitcoin is valued so high. It can’t be used as a currency if it’s so volatile. And if it’s not used as a currency, then what value does it have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:55
Because every keeps buying it to try and catch the wave. That’s literally it.

Ah yes, out of dumb luck he founded Twitter, then in another stroke of massive luck he founded Square.

Yup, the poster above you clearly doesn’t understand opportunity cost.
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:33:27
Can you please explain specifically what you mean by market manipulation? How could someone cause the price to spike like this?
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:08:00
Gotcha, how does the whale know there there are lots of short positions out there? Are there any exchanges that show this data?
