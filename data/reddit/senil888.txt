Except fighting this battle against New York and Ben Lawsky alone is a loosing battle, because its easy for one crypto to give in. But add in Dogecoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, and all the major and popular cryptocurrencies out there to the battle, it becomes overwhelming. All is doing is asking to allow us to join you in the battle against regulation.

If it could come preloaded with the kernel for Adafruit's PiTFT displays, I'd buy an A+ and load it on. Then I could have a tiny little portable Pi Blockchain with a tiny little display to match.

Because that's business suicide. It may suck, but for now it's the main payment method for millions. Bitcoin currently is more of a "secondary, but preferred" payment method at this point. It's not widespread enough to be primary, but it's not consolidated enough to not be preferred.
No businessman/woman with half a brain would remove the payment option that is getting all the money through.
