I checked what you said. Are you sure? I found this [info]( and it seems to disagree with you. I am confused??

That sounds very promising yet microsoft has [a lot]( to compensate and prove before it is regarded a reliable corporation and they can stand back their product without needing such pretenses. Even microsoft accepted [gnulinux superiority]( unwillingly. That is a good step, but simultaneously they are going in a direction worse than their amends.

Wow that sounds pretty cool man. I have an ordinary 4 core 12 GB ram computer and I squeeze every bit of it. I have on top of headless debian my nextcloud cloud on debian, arch for desktop, debian for non\-exit tor node and freenet. Since I found out about onlyoffice I dumped windows replacing it with arch. KVM is truely awesome, I can play tomb raider with as good performance as bare metal on arch. I have another arch on my usb which I connect to host via ssh or to arch via vnc from the university. Maybe this seems so trivial from outside but I feel the excitement of the saying "A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" by Arthur C. Clark. I have never downloaded red hat since It seems to require support. Do you think I can use it efficiently without buying support? 'cause I am broke af.

Try onlyoffice. So far I love it. It is free software. Only disadvantage is it is not distrubuted in any repos yet you can install it with snap or if you use debian or fedora based system they provide installation package [here]( As last resort you may compile it for high performance.
edit: It is fully compatible with ms office
