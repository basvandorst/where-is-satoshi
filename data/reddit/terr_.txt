Oh my, no, no, no, I can personally attest that Kim Schmitz was on my shitlist back around 2002, he's got a *loooong* history of shady and outright criminal stuff.

TBF hasn't done as much credit-card theft, fleeing arrest, felony convictions, or generally acquiring dirty money through criminal means through the first place.
Well, probably. I don't know the guy.

"You must have me confused with Kim Kimble, Kim Tim Jim Vestor, or Kim Schmitz. We're quadruplet identical twins, and while my brothers have been implicated or even convicted of crimes, you can trust *me* because I'm not like them at all..."

2016? Heh, I remember Kim Schmitz from ~2002, at which time he was going as "Kim Kimble" and bragging he had an army of script-kiddies who would hack Osama Bin Laden.
The guy's got a 30-year history of exaggeration, bragging, and fraud, which makes it so weird to see him still around.

What kind of false-choice is that? Are you saying you'd prefer Hitler?
