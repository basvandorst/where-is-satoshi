It's not bitcoin, it's basically Brave points that you can't exchange for money, you can only give to the Brave foundation and donate to sites you want to see without adds.
@_date: 2016-08-17 20:53:12
I understand but your analogy is flawed, it implies that who produces earn the money which is a lie. The owner earns the money, not the worker, the producer, designer, whatever you want to call. There's a reason everybody say you don't get rich working, you get rich by employing others. 
So no, it's not wrong to whoever made it, it maybe wrong to some rich group that is actually is charge, and they didn't even made it. So why should they own that design? It's an idea and they didn't even had it, why they should own it?

I don't know either, it seems shady asf, I don't think it's related to bitcoin, they just use it as a hype. But yeah, I'm curious onto how will companies get their money, maybe they will just use it to pay for displaying adds in the platform, so they don't actually get money, just users wanting to view their adds and they have a "discount" on adds.

The exit node can see unencrypted (it doesn't break TLS, but HTTP pages are visible), but hosting a server on tor means no end-node, the onion server is the end-node and only it can decrypt the content, so you are safe while accessing .onion.

And segwit only solves the problem temporarily, a hard fork will be needed later.
That doesnt change the fact that the decisions are centralized at the core devs.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:22:07
Loool, and why arent BU devs experts?
wtf are we children that invoking some abstract authority of "experts" means anything?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:24:18
One piece at a time hacking your way into it, it doesn't stand, you will have to work around the current protocol.
And why are those options bad?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:57:24
It's not a technical discussion, the implementation doesn't matter in this situation, if you validate the block or not doesn't matter when you are validating a chain nobody uses.
If you want to use bitcoin you will have to use the fork the miners are using, because they are the ones with capital invested in bitcoin and making the proof-of-work.
Your consensus means nothing if they don't agree with it. Your node has no power over the decisions of who actually has the hashing power make. 
You provided 0 arguments to counter that, because you know it's true, you can only hide behind the specifications of the protocol, which don't mean anything because they are bound to the proof-of-work, which is the harder part, the part which nodes don't do.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:16:22
That argument of authority.
Pathetic as fuck. Just shows you know nothing. We aren't kids, argument of authority, specially here is just sad.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:33:18
Only if it fits the narrative. Sigwit got implemented because the devs decided. Not the community.
And why isnt BU implemented and being supported by the devs if they only need to publish it? 
Because the core devs don't want, but ta huge part of the community does.
Thats why everybody is mad that the people are saying fuck off to the devs and making their forks.
Thats decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:11:30
You clearly are the one that doens't.
A consensus of one doesn't matter, individual nodes have no relevancy on the market, because they will be alone, a consensus where nobody has capital invested is irrelevant.
The consensus is made around the fork being actively mined, where the money is at, not the other way. 
It's a consensus inside the protocol being used, not a consensus of what protocol should be used.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:51:07


So... The core devs?
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:18:22
So why isn't BU implemented by the Core project?
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:04:30
So you let the core devs decide? How is that decentralization?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:39:16
LOOOOL, you never provided any argument, specially a technical one, you only said some random facts about nodes.
What the fuck are you even talking about, really, nothing you are saying makes any sense in the discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:43:29
hur dur I'm a dumbass that has no argument against what said so I'm going to say random facts I know to pretend I know something.
If you can't argue against my points shut up, you don't need to say random facts to pretend you are smart, your ego isn't relevant to the discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:03:38
Said the one that never provided a argument to say why the nodes are relevant if they don't provide the proof-of-work, they just test it, they make sure there is no fraud in the protocol, but they don't make the protocol more relevant.
They assure the miners are doing everything correct, just that, so you have to use the same fork as the miners to do so, meaning you have no power over it.
That's what a market it dumbass, if you can't grasp how a market operates how the fuck are you going to talk about the implementation of one, it doesn't matter because the problem is not the implementation, it's a root part of a market.
It will never not be like that in a market, who has capital has the power, individuals don't have relevant capital compared to who is profiting from it, like miners today, and another group in the future.
A market is centralized, it's not democratic, it's hierarchical, all of them are, so they obviously will be.
Sigwit won't solve that, just give the power to some power tripping individuals that want to implement the latest *cool techs* to bitcoin, like it was a alt-coin.
It's not your lab, if you want to play play with alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:08:19


If nobody mines it how is it relevant? Deploying a node is cheap, the miners can easily deploy thousands of their nodes and you become literally irrelevant.


So? Why can't I make a node with the fork the miners use and how do you have power over it? How do your decision influence what gets mined and what not. What protocol is being used by the majority? You don't, you follow the money.


Those nodes, the people running those nodes just will be in a different chain, it will be rejected by their protocol and nothing else, it doesn't matter.
Running a node that is irrelevant doesn't give you power.


But nodes are cheap, meaning they can be easily replaced, miners can't, to replace a miner you need hundreds of thousands of dollars, which you don't have.
How can't you see it's irrelevant because they don't make the actual proof of work, they just check if it's ok to their desire. It doesn't change anything, there will be nodes running the other fork and there will also be the miners.
Your node will be irrelevant and die because nobody that matter uses that chain.
How can't you understand such a simple concept?
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:39:44
They didnt have proper precedures for hard forks, thats what we are trying to fix.
And even then, if http2 came right after http1 we wouldn't be dealing with the change now that is hard.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:38:23
Because the core project doesn't want to, go to the btc subreddit and you will see plenty of articles saying the opposite, propaganda doesn't mean much.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:29:48
The devs are telling the community what to do. Its not do nothing, if you want to do something to just do something why segwit instead of BU? 
Its the opposite, with the hard fork we will know we can fork the network if we want, even if the devs don't like it.
They shouldnt be allowed to decide what fork is being implemented like they did.
We already lost those guarantees because people like you give unlimiteds
 power to the devs. Thankfully you giving power doesn't do much.
Because individuals have no power in a market, thats not how they work.

Wtf, you guys have no argument so you have to say the other side is shilling.
Great logic right there.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:55:14
Because segwit increases the block marginally, changes are limited to the hack they made to extend the protocol without breaking compatibility.


Well, people bitching that there are people disagreeing, and that BU exists and it makes people not want sigwit is them wanting to be centralized. So changes are being made to the protocol to increase centralization, including letters to exchanges and organizing a oligopoly on bitcoin.
Nodes are irrelevant to the network, they just make cute statistics, they don't influence the system.


And why is hard-fork bad, it's necessary, it's better than having a stale protocol, just like the web, stuck with http1 to not break compatibility.
We should make a hard-fork to fix bitcoin's mistakes (it was the first, there is a lot of learning to do) instead of allowing the network to grow making the hard-fork harder and having to deal with hacks to extend the protocol.
A hard-fork is good and necessary, waiting longer and longer just makes it harder to implement.
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:18:20
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:02:07
It's not harder, it has a proper protocol.
The problem of a non consensus system is exactly that change is never made, we don't move to http2, we don't move to ipv6. Because we didn't have to, specially in the early days.
We are in the early days of bitcoin, we can and should evolve the protocol breaking compatibility, but solving the problems.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:28:48
Why is here better than there?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:42:20
Control bitcoin how? What influence do you have and what control?
There is no point in saying you control if you have no fucking power over any decision, sure you can chose to run a node that is not compatible, so what? You are out of the chain, you will be alone whining that nobody has chosen the protocol you want.
A market is not democratic, if you think that you have no clue about markets, more capital means more power over said market, the market follows the money and the money isn't on the individual idealistic dumbass that believes he has any power over the network.
You don't, no decision you make influence the future of bitcoin and you know it.
It's just sad to believe that.
If you choose to not support the protocol the capital is invested on then you will be in a non relevant chain, what power do you have?
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:00:20
There are many agents, they just don't have the power to decide, they either accept or leave the network.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:54:06
Evidence of what dumbass, you only said what nodes do, not why the fuck it is relevant to imply sigwit is not centralization and BU is. That the core devs aren't trying to impose something they want and not something the market wants.
People want BU but the core devs don't want BU, they want sigwit, why do they decide what gets implemented upstream? The core has chosen, not mattering the market, this is exactly what centralization means.
We obey them or we create another upstream. We can't be dependent on them deciding the future of bitcoin, that's what they are trying to do.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:21:00
Thats not how open source works, they control the project and decide what forks there will be, which feature there will be, the only way to scape is to make another fork, with other people developing.
So you will have to submit yourself to the decisions of the core dev in the way its going now.
Nice decentralization. Its just the rulers you prefer.
Even the industry letter was a move to give the power to the devs.

So you are saying that the centralization around the core is better than around the miners because the miners are in china.
I was merely pointing that it was centralization, as everybody was saying it was not. It's just a centralization you like.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:46:57
Lol are they your calendar words? The new ones you learn every week, how cute, good on you :). I guess you learned them today and think they are relevant alone.
They mean nothing alone nor to this discussion, it literally makes no sense.
Really, wtf, nothing you say has anything to do with the discussion, what is wrong with you and why are you still answering? If you want to argue make a fucking argument to explain why I'm wrong.
Don't say I don't know, don't say random things, give a fucking argument.
But I guess you are incapable, maybe it's good you are irrelevant to the protocol, you don't know what you say so you repeat random things you read somewhere to think you are smart and make the correct decisions.
Everything you said is empty and you never backed up, so really, why?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:47:54


Nice strategy my dude.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:06:49

@_date: 2017-03-20 03:54:28
It doesnt apply to a group that decides what get implemented upstream and not what? That wants to make a industry letter saying they should decide?
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:34:19
Nice feelings.
We aren't kids, invoking some arbitrary authority of knowledge is irrelevant. Nothing you said has anything to do with the subject, you just got random facts about bitcoin.

Two times in a row, wtf are you talking about.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:05:59
The miners are the only ones relevant, a market is hierarchical and who has more capital invested has more power, in this case the market.
Idealistic individuals have no power in deciding it. You may choose to centralize at the core devs hands to compensate for your lack of power.
But its centralization anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:51:43
That has literally nothing to do with the discussion, that doesn't mean you have power, just that you say if some transaction follows some protocol or not, you don't decide the protocol being used by who mines.
If the miners break compatibility with your majority nodes then bitcoin won't move, people who want bitcoin to be relevant will comply with the miners, because that's where the money is at.
Staying in your dream world where everybody obeys majority of the nodes, when the nodes don't actually do the proof-of-work that makes bitcoin relevant, is irrelevant, the nodes have no power and will comply with the money.
Sigwit is just the core devs trying to pass the power to them, making the industry accept an oligopoly, lol. A cartel.
Beautiful decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:15:39
Who decides who has more merits, a centralized group, like the core devs?
Meritocracy is relative to what are your intents, it's who has more influence to achieve some goal, who does more for that goal.
The goal depends on who you talk to, the core devs will say they should decide, of course, not the community, so they force a soft fork on the community instead of allowing the community to decide if they want a hard fork.
Nice meritocracy...
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:42:57
hahahahahhaah what a cognitive dissonance.
I'm against what the government does in those cases, but it only happens because they have relations with the private sector, if it was the private sector alone nothing would change for the better, it would only lose the even small regulations and necessity of a public response, because the state at least has some kind of democracy.
But I'm against it, as I'm against the authority of a boss.
And what? They use the land dumbass, they live there, it's just a different use than you want, it's their economy and their culture, just because we live here it doesn't mean we should just destroy what rests, they can and are insert in our society, but the point is that they don't do it because it's how they live.
And they can't defend themselves? What? They can, but they don't have the means to get the equipments millionaires have.


Because without it somebody would? It's pathetic, you can only argument something the government does that is bad while trying to imply it not existing is better. But you have not provided one argument to defend it would be better.
I have provided arguments against your points and provided a better option.

The only thing you are saying is that the FDA isn't perfect and doesn't catch everything, everybody knows that.
That doesn't imply at all that no regulation is better than a one that is not that good.
If even with the FDA regulations they do things like saying cigarettes are safe what the fuck would they do without it? Without anybody to force them to test things or stop lying about the effects.
Sure the FDA allowed, but now they don't anymore, if they didn't exist would companies have stopped saying cigarettes are bad?
No, that hurts profits...
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:27:56

I agree, but a company that only exists because of it is too ;).


So you want to change from this with representative democracy to this without any kind of democracy where you can only shout "YOU ARE VIOLATING THE NAP" and cry alone? lol


No you don't, because you have to compete with others, if you have a monopoly your profit is maximized, so you can enforce a monopoly or just fight for it profiting from destroying small agencies.
Your entire system is based in oh but they won't, there's no reason they can't, but just trust the god market, they wont...

Private property means private property of the means of production, a company. Just it, money can be capital when used to buy a mean or production, but when you can't you can't, there is nothing to legitimize your ownership over the workers that actually work there.
Personal property can exist without private property.
@_date: 2017-01-27 01:38:28

@_date: 2017-01-26 04:02:06


That's why we shouldn't give people power, so there can't be power or authority to be corrupted, you are getting close. But you still holds together with the authority of the boss, you like that authority but you like to question authority, lol.


That's why I'm against all individual power, all power over your life which you don't control, you are not. You defend the private power of a business owner, its influence in the market.


One more reason to be against all private power ;).
Everything should be defined through direct democracy and free association, if you submit yourself to a boss, to be hired you are subject to his authority and its corruption, because that's what a private power really is, a way to force people to comply and benefit your life, not mattering their opinion. If the other choice is destitution it's not a choice, it's exactly like a gun to your head, and it has nothing to do with nature, only with our current market and economy that forces you to comply with it otherwise there is no other way to be a sane person.


So let's end all private property laws ;). Let's see you arguing tooth and nail then. You need the state to defend your right to hold a piece of paper saying you own everything produced by the people in a place, you own a company because you have an army ready to enforce your ownership, the states army.
If the workers just decide to not obey you and just kept doing their work, ignoring you and organizing themselves you couldn't do anything without big daddy government.
Because absent ownership of a mean of production only exists when you force it, when authoritarianism makes it happen.
We are in favor of personal property, but private property is completely arbitrary and only exists because of the government.

You might look at the situation in Brazil and in Amazonia, where they already do that. It's beautiful the true ancapistan.
Companies that extract wood and raise cattle need land to profit, but they can't because either there are natives living there or it's for the forest protection. They don't care, they have their private army and they murder natives every day.
This is happening [RIGHT NOW]( because that increases their profit.
They murder natives and use their land or they just use their army to protect themselves and fight against the government.
Yes, they already fired a lot of times against the federal police and nobody wants to go there. So yeah, profit can come from destruction and the market benefits from it... Not the people, but the company owners that get more profit.


So? I can literally raise cattle in that land without giving a shit. I can get every piece of wood and destroy the entire forest there for that. And in a lot of places there are things to mine, oil to extract, you name it, land can give a lot of resources, therefore profit.
And specially I can force them, like they did in the past, you know, empires, feudalism, they have the guns, you obey.


So feudalism?

So I choose another boss or become a boss perpetuating the problem?
Lol, against every authority, except yours. Oh wait, you don't have any, you lick boots, and if do I don't expect you to want to lose your authority, nobody does, that's why it shouldn't exist in the first place.

Cooperatives, lol, the problem is private ownership of the means of production, you owning what you didn't produce.
We don't like theft, that's just it.


There is government, there aren't rulers, you decide everything about your life and what you own, you own what you produce, you are free to organize with whoever you wants, but to live you need to organize and cooperate with other people, because you know, life isn't magic, a lot of organization is needed to take care of everything else in life besides your jobs.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:29:48


Not if its his job to fuck you up. You know, like gangs and mafias do, and if you want the state too. Just because it's private it doesn't mean it's magical, they can do the exact same thing.
You know what is a profitable job? To have a private army to steal from people. I can make deals with other big agencies to not steal from them, and they won't touch me. And fuck up only the small ones.
You never hire the second best option to protect you, you will go with the first because they assure your protection, they can fight for it, not just talk.
So in a market it will become a monopoly, even if it's a oligopoly.

What is wrong with you? If you are a shareholder owning a share at wallmart but you don't work there, or if you have employees that aren't shareholders then it is private ownership of the means of production. Private property... We are against it.
It's just it, if there are employees that don't own the mean of production, and their share in the production, and that don't have authority to decide how their work will be done it is capitalism, not socialism.


The bank workers, besides that people who put money there don't own it, that doesn't even make sense they get a loan and they pay the loan, just like we do today. And those banks are for loans to cooperative, not just hold your money there.


Your money belongs to you? I don't get your point.

If you have an employee it's private property. If you made it or bought it then it's yours. The point is that you can't profit from other people work.
Your house is personal property, your car too, all those things, but if you make it into a company and hire someone it's private property. That difference already exists today. If you have employees it's different than if you just use it.


If you use it, if not you can't hire people for a wage, if you do that it's private property.
If there is a company, if there is profit the workers of said company own it, there are no absentee owners, nor people that own more. You own what you produce.

Look at PGP, it sucks to use so almost nobody does, if it was incredibly easy and user friendly everybody could use that encryption.
Now if only you uses it, you are flagged as one of the few that is protecting against them, if everybody uses, then you are ok, even though they don't see those benefits, they don't need to. They use because it's better for them, as it is for you.

It was, by private companies :).




I'm against it too ;), it just doesn't solve anything passing their power to a private company that doesn't have any democratic mean, it only follows what gives profit to the company owners.


Source? Because that's literally the purpose of every company, companies exist to generate profit, the state doesn't. Just because you are triggered because you have to follow the government doesn't mean the solution is to follow companies. They have literally 0 reason to defend our interests, because it doesn't even try to be democratic, not even representative democracy.


Yup, passing the government's power to the private sector surely will solve everything, it's not like the entire purpose of the private sector is profit for the shareholders. 
Magic. 


The government controls, but I agree, not the people. That doesn't give any reason to want to pass the regulations to the private companies. Because the people don't control any company, they obey the companies, and they don't even have a democratic voice on it.


What does that mean lol

Most places have some FDA... I was talking about the US, but the US also has 300 millions of people, most places don't, so it's a different scale.
Where I live we have something like that, and I sure hope it never goes away. Before that slavery was legal, and they didn't even have sewage system, only slaves to carry the shit arround... I wouldn't trust their culture much to keep me safe...
But sure it was more of a joke, I was being sarcastic because the other redditor implied since they do a not so good job not doing it at all would be better. Which is a fallacy.


That's not the FDA's fault it has a lot of things behind, including the size of the foods, the corn lobby, and a lot of shitty practices, the US isn't first in almost any list, it's not a regulatory agency's fault...
But yes, it's not perfect, but that doesn't imply non-regulation is better than some that doesn't catch everything.

So you are saying that rich people have more vote, and they are allowed to decide. 8 people hold as much money as half of the population, so they together can decide everything? Is that it?
People don't vote with their dollars, corporations vote with their profit, individuals have 3 choices under this system, submit themselves to a boss, become a boss and have people submit to your authority or be a destitute.
Corporations vote, we pretend we like.


So why we aren't doing that today? Most big companies do a lot of shit to provide low prices, fast delivery, benefits to the users.
Why aren't we voting with our wallets today? Maybe because that's not true...

It's not pointless, it has a lot of benefits, because it's a really good database specially to keep tabs of money. Bank systems are incredibly problematic, outdated and it must be very secure, blockchains make those a lot easier.
Just because it's not your ideal vision of the blockchain technology it doesnt stop bringing benefits to a lot of sectors that aren't like bitcoin.

What? They own like shareholders do. What if a shareholder wants to take his 2% in machines and go on a demolition nearby with it?
Really that makes no sense.


They are organized, they can vote on leaders and their hierarchy or then can have councils and delegate jobs, you know, they are all working, the point is that a job of authority can be delegate or don't exist, they choose how they work. If they don't like they are free to organize with cooperatives that work in other ways.


What resource?


Their organization through direct democracy my dude, it's not central planning, they organize.
There are other organizations like communes to handle things outside the economy, they are based on direct democracy or consensus too, your points make no sense.


As you said it's public owned, you are saying that he should be able to steal from me? Because if I didn't allowed him to use what I own why should he use? You guys seem to love to steal things from people.
True freedom.


Again, depends on their organization, they can be inside a commune with laws decided by everybody concerned, you choose what democracy you want, direct, consensus, w/e. So you choose how to live your life, you can leave at any time, you just don't because it's how we live, we organize and cooperate.
So those rules can be enforced.
Look into Rojava and more specifically Alepo, they have been working like I said, and their protection is an army that only obeys the commune, the organization and defense is more complex, since there are local protection, like cops and external, with militias, like the army.


What? There are rules and laws, we will try to prevent there, otherwise the local judicial system will decide, the system that this person agreed to, if they didn't then they have no right to use the helicopter at all, they are stealing...
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:12:32


So feudalism?


Except those with little money, if you have a bigger army you can impose your desire, is that what you are saying?
Because I can assure you a billionaire could easily drop hundreds of millions and murder entire cities just to clean the land and allow them to extract natural resources. They are easily much stronger than the original people.
True freedom.


Not if your entire business is profiting by fucking people up? It's a huge business lol.


I mean, it's just sad that the only reason you work is for a number in your bank account then why not just kill yourself, really, your entire reason to wakeup and do what you do is to feel rich and powerful? Or to own a company?
Lol, true success.
Btw the point is that if you don't do anything you won't be able to sustain yourself, in any system, like people are forced to work inside this system to sustain themselves today, so I don't understand your point.

Like 2008?


So I make another brand? You think the market is magical, they have the infrastructure
 and the money, they aren't rich because they are cool, they are rich because they generate profit to their clients.


Except is not because when they break they take the entire market with them, creating a huge crisis, and then to prevent the economy from a total collapse they "pardoned", it's private profit, public loss. It's not magic.


Like they did with medicine cigarrets? Companies don't give a shit about long term profit, there can easily be one company that grows fast, makes the owner rich and goes away, they happen all the time.
So with them you are going to take other peoples lives, because they didn't do their job.
At least they are free, lol.
The market isn't magical, just because you want to work it doesn't mean it will, because it's not about being good, it's about generating profit, and there is a lot of profit to be generated from destruction.
The entire broken window theory to agitate economy is made on that, it's just shifting the profits to a sector, at least for a time.
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:32:50
Wut, I just see a bunch or speculation without any source or argument behind.
And explain to me, when there was a free market? Please specify a time and why it was free market. Btw even the protection of the private property is a mean to intervene in the economy and regulate the free market. If the market was free the workers of your company should be able to seize it and keep making business with who wants to, the market should remove companies with invalid ownership, not big daddy government.
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:50:30


You have the shares of where you work, so the shares mean a right to decide how it happens, you have a vote and you get your part of the profit, just it.


I'm not exactly a market socialist, but with communal banks, organized by workers. They get loans and everything, some cooperatives already exist. Like Mondragon, it was created with loans and all and during a socialist revolution in spain (against a fascist dictatorship).






They pay the loan, what's your point? If they can't pay the loan the cooperative doesn't exist. It's not the socialism I prefer so I haven't read much about it, but it's basically what I said, everything work without a state and a owner.


What? That makes 0 sense.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:55:59


No it doesn't, you have no fucking clue what you are against and yet you still keep talking, what the actual fuck.
Socialism means workers control of the means of production, just it, there is no owner, every worker owns a part.
It can happen in many ways, from communism which is **stateless, classless and moneyless** to market socialism, that market socialism can have a state or not, but personally I've never seen anyone defend a socialism with a state.
What you might be thinking about is the Marxist-Leninist socialist state, where they wanted to make a transition to communism, which is stateless. But they failed and I don't defend marxism-leninism.
I'm libertarian communist, most socialists are libertarian (we actually invented the world and it still is socialist to most of the world).


That doesn't change anything lol.

@_date: 2017-01-25 17:57:50
I understand, I hate its guts too for many reasons, but my comment was specifically about people wanting to end it without a replacement.
Actually I'm anarchist, I'm against a government as I'm against capitalism, so I am against the FDA how it is, but removing it won't solve anything, just move their power to corporations, and that is even worse.
But yes, we should criticize them, just to improve or if we want to change the superstructure offering another option great, but that option doesn't exist nowadays.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:46:56
So you can't even read lol, I never said any of that.
There can be profit, there can be a market and consumption in socialism, we aren't against that, there are some without market, but besides that it doesn't matter.
The point is that the profit goes to who works, instead of who has a paper saying they deserve the profit, and that who works there doesn't have to obey that individual. We are against that power, as we are against all the other powers you are. The workers own the means of production they work on.
You just like to lick boots of the boss, we don't.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:31:12

Wut, the government has representative democracy so it is as democratic as the capitalist government we had since its creation. But sure, I'm in favor of direct democracy, our current democracy still is authoritarian.
But you also don't elect your boss, capitalism gives private power to individuals that aren't elected, they just on in the market, but if you have capital you have influence in the market. It's just how it is, capitalism is not democratic, its market is not. Individuals don't matter, corporations do, capital does.
So while it's not perfect, a shitty democracy is better than no democracy at all.

I mean, a lot of bitcoiners are temporarily moving to litecoin because of the high transaction time and fees. A lot of systems that use a blockchain as a backend, or that the end-user simply doesn't care are moving to litecoin.
Now what? Why would they advocate for something they believe is bad to a coin they have to use because of the current material conditions of bitcoin sucks so much that they can't use it.
I had many problems trying to move my bitcoins to ethereum because of transaction times. As a user I'm not happy with what you guys are doing with bitcoin. It has sucked more to use bitcoin than to use a debit-card and that wasn't truth some months ago.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:32:42
The point is that a node is useless, and if the chain disagrees with your rules you are alone.
So its either comply or find another chain to comply with, the node has no power.
The power is at the capital, exchanges and miners hold the capital in bitcoin, they make the chain relevant.
If you dont like them you have to find others you like or be in a empty chain, nice.
A node is just a masturbatory action to feel the chaim agrees with you, but the point is that you agree with the chain, not the other way around. Its symbolic.
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:41:49
I mean nodes literally mean nothing, so it's not even a vote. Just some people using it to show a number, not having a node doesn't mean you don't support a side.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:21:30
They have no power or control over the network, they have a idealistic, simbolic value.
The network lives greatly without any of those nodes, because they dont enforce anything they just witness what happens. You only need 1 witness you trust to know if everything is ok.
@_date: 2017-04-25 06:39:31
Lol, it's like investing in a bank, you give them money, they agree to pay you back some time later with extra fees, they own you money.
But they will pay you, they will make a shitton of money with what you invested (+ a lot of people), so there is nothing to worry about, it's safe and it gives you money.
It's literally how our economy works, being a state or investment banks. They control and own everything, exactly because it's how they profit, by betting on other people's work and well, and since they have authority over the worker they also define how they will work.
I'm not saying it's not free lunch, but if it is, isn't our entire economy like that?
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:25:12

Just because you say your node is relevant it doesnt make it.
It doesnt mean anything, just that a random dude is mad at the protocol who has money is using.
Nothing changes for the system, it only affects you.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:43:32
Yes, that's my point, you only need one node to do that, and I'm sure miners and exchanges will have theirs, it doesn't matter individual users having one, it's good for you and for the network, but it doesn't have any real meaning, a anomaly would have been found by nodes of who has capital invested on bitcoin, because they would lose it if it got corrupted.
So as I said, it's useless for individual users, and specifically to mean anything about usage or the protocol they support, because the user doesn't decide the protocol to support, exchanges and miners do. The user just says their opinion and gets a pat in the back.
Capital is money invested or infra-estructure, meaning you have a company with employees and other expenses while profiting from that, it's an investment. They have the power on the network and everybody that is a small fish, like individuals will follow them, as will you, or you will be alone in a useless chain, with worthless money.
