Can I measure my portfolio not only in BTC or some fiat but in ETH and so on? I'm missing this option in all apps. It would be nice!

I want to burn all my money... 
Jokes aside. I'm trying to understand all the technical stuff behind bitcoin.

Hm I dont understand what you mean. A transaction has an input an an output. A digital signature is created with my private key and the transaction data. What does it have to do with the recipient address? 
edit. sell your car -&gt; pay off -&gt;buy bitcoins with the rest -&gt; profit!!!

P.S. Is it also possible to read from every transaction on the blockchain what the public key of the recipient is? E.g. the recipient address is a new one and had no outgoing transactions.

If I create the transaction code and send broadcast it completely manually. Do the miners validate the address?

He is poor. That is what happened to him. And the guy that sold it to him is rich. Never forget that this is a zero summ game.
