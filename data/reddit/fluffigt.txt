Not if the Fed imposes negative interest. Then the debt will increase slower than new money is created, effecrively reducing debt. This is the current situation with the SEK in Sweden at the moment.

With high taxes I meant "about as high as the US, or higher", which is true. What constitutes high taxes is, I realize, quite subjective.

Most first world nations have high taxes. That is part of what makes them first world nations. After WW2 we figured out that the wellfare state was the best way to create a content population, avoiding what happened in Germany, where mass unemployment and discontent led to the Nazis rise to power.
However, in most civilized countries, the IRS equivalent calculates your taxes for you, then preprints your tax forms. You are free to make changes, but a vast majority of people don't.

That's what economists believed before, but it's been negative for about 3 years and we are not quite reaching the inflation goal of 3% (still talking Sweden). We are at an inflation just shy of 2% iirc.

Are you saying bitcoin cannot be inflated?

Then again, gold as a currency was abandoned quite a few years ago.

Lol, ok.

No that makes them both traded goods, not currencies. Orange juice options are being traded in the commodities market, that doesn’t make orange juice a currency.

What the hell kind of restaurant do you go to where they walk off with your card? I haven’t seen that happen since the 90’s. Everyone has handheld card readers now.

Wouldn't that only apply if Bitcoin was a legal tender?

Why is the price listed in $ and not in bitcoin?

Inflation is not caused solely by adding currency into circulation. There ate a slew of factors that affect inflation.

This while owning more than 50% of the worlds wealth. Let that sink in for a minute.

Oh, so what I said...

How is that supposed to work exactly?
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:24:13
Not jealous at all, I have more money than I need or really know what to do with. Like I said, I work in the financial industry. I do give a significant portion of my income to different charities.
The problem is that the system is so broken that a few individuals spend resources that could be used to lift millions out of poverty on stupid shit they don't need. A lot of people would say that is their prerogative. I think that is bullshit.

The third comment is not wrong though. Nothing can affect the price of Bitcoin other thsn orders to buy (or sell, but thst would go the other way). It’s in the nature of a currency that is not connected to any nation’s economy.

Please. I work in the financial industry. Wealth is not mainly used to create value through innovation and production, it is used to create more wealth through leveraging the financial system while spending as little as possible on actual growth.
Sure, innovation happens, but not mainly thanks to wealthy people. It happens thanks to dreamers who push the boundaries. Some of those dreamers succeed and become wealthy, and some of them even remain altruistic in their wealth, while many others forget their roots and become greedy. Mainly though, the greedy ones are the children of succesful people. They didn't work hard, they were handed their wealth, and they leverage it to hoard more.
People succeeding and getting rich is not s problem. People who are rich hoarding resources is.
That wasn't even my point though. My point was that you made it sound as if it was insane that the richest 1% were paying 40% of taxes, while that in my ears sound quite low since they have more than 50% of all the money.

I'm using the definition "lose purchase power" which is what the post we are commenting on states in the headline, so it's not unreasonable to assume that is the definition.
It is also the definition that is generally used in any economic discussion. When the fed sets an inflation goal of 3%, they don't mean "add 3% currency into curculation". Then it wouldn't be a goal, it would be a task.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:43:16
That is a common misconception. Of course money can be used to lift people out of poverty. Not by just giving it to the poor, but by giving them education and filling their basic needs like food and shelter so they can spend their efforts on becoming productive members of society. Believe it or not, most poor people would rather not be poor if given the chance.
Besides, you keep conflating resources and money. Resources are what you spend money to buy. It is what you use to create goods and improve people's lives. I talk about resources while you talk about money.
Finally, the main reason people need aid in the USA is because the wealthy don't pay a living wage. Did you know that 32% of households that receive food stamps have at least one wage earner? Did you also know that the minimum wage, when adjusted forminflation, is 35% lower today than it was in 1968?
