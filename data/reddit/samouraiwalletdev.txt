As far as we know, this is the first implementation of BIP47 payment codes to be publicly released. We open sourced before end of March and have had contacts with other wallet providers who we know are working on their own implementations.
Other than routing the transaction being created, the Samourai wallet app does not observe the total balance of a payment channel (see our source code). Payment codes are not sent to our backend APIs so individual addresses cannot be grouped together with payment codes outside of the app (in any case, I know of no existing APIs that handle BIP47 payment codes). Our server cannot observe channel balances  because private keys are necessary to do this and no private keys ever transit via our backend APIs.
We are actively developing our own backend systems with a view towards ever increasing privacy.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:13:28
The wallet knows that it has received a payment because it is watching addresses that are generated using shared secrets derived from public keys of the incoming payment code and private keys on the receiving wallet. This is why it is not possible for any party outside of the 2 wallets in question to observe and tie the transactions together. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:18:03
Kristov Atlas announced it.

We have been running pre-alpha versions since Feb. of last year. First Play Store for alpha group was 7 May and it's been our main wallet since then for amounts large and small.
We will soon be moving away from 3rd party APIs (currently bci &amp; chain.so) asap and on to our own APIs on our own servers in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:07:17
Wallets that support BIP47 will generate a payment code for every BIP44 account. Funds received via a payment code are included in the total of the corresponding BIP44 account.
@_date: 2016-04-28 07:17:25
This is a v1 implementation of BIP47. Work has started on v2 BIP47 which, if I am not mistaken, addresses the concerns you have expressed.
@_date: 2016-04-28 07:17:03
Payment codes are imported once. They are then used to generate the individual addresses for the channel being established. The wallet receiving a notification transaction (incoming payment code) does not have to import the code via scan or paste because it uses the copy of the payment code that it decrypts off of the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:14:19
Been looking into fdroid. Looks good.
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:06:21
While we are in alpha we use bci and chain.so for API calls. Our own backend APIs are under development and will be run on our own servers located in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:53:54
As for the second part of your question: private keys can be derived to p2pkh (legacy), p2sh-p2wpkh (BIP49, and bech32 (and other p2sh formats). At least 3 different public address formats derived from the same private key.
As for the first part of your question: private keys also have different formats but the most commonly used one presently is WIF-compressed (as displayed by BIP39 page tool). Does the private key displayed by Electrum start with a 'K' or an 'L' ?  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:09:52
We get it ;) Always a bit scary.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:01:03
Open a support ticket at support so we can have a look. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:46:11
Samourai now supports spending to bech32 segwit addresses and has been tested w/Electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:36:12
Does the Electrum address start with 'bc' ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:56
This is a display bug that is now identified and we are working on a fix. No funds are lost and all funds remain under the control of private keys derived from the user's wallet seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:14:28
Doesn't vary AFAIK. Always uses the private key to spend the entire balance to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:35:34
Segwit requires the use of compressed format exclusively.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:17:06
We have a much older version which runs on Android 4.x but it doesn't include many of the latest features and you will have to build from source:   Currently, we only support Android 5.0 and over.
@_date: 2018-09-13 15:29:23
STONEWALL will trigger and imitate a 2-wallet Coinjoin if it is set to ON in the wallet settings (it is ON by default) and the wallet utxo set for the desired spend permits. Read details about the algo here:  STONEWALL itself is based on the Boltzmann measure of transaction entropy:   If triggered, STONEWALL will always provide a positive Boltzmann score.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:55:19
You can watch the address using Sentinel for Android. You can sweep the privkey for the address using Samourai Wallet or Sentinel for Android.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:30:12
Samourai Wallet now sweeps private key / segwit address pairs from segwitaddress.org and coinb.in . Give that a try.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:35:12
Just as an aside... we never could have emptied anything. We have zero access to your privkeys.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:23:37
This is not a bug. It is by design. We err on the side of privacy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:29:45
The intent is to make sure that change outputs and spend outputs are more difficult to distinguish. This is an ongoing effort tied in to our use of BIP126.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:54:17
You're welcome ;)
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:15:08
You can sweep those addresses using Samourai Wallet.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:32:19
1-wallet STONEWALLs:
2-wallet STONEWALL (yes, it's a CoinJoin):
Better to check them out on Samourai's OXT where entropy rating is displayed as well as clustering.

Your payment code is used to create a 1-1 channel for receiving payments. Only the sender and yourself have knowledge of the actual chain of addresses used and the sums involved. You can give the same payment code to all of your contacts but each contact can only see the addresses created in their 1-1 channel to you.
Here's my payment code ;) PM8TJgndZSWCBPG5zCsqdXmCKLi7sP13jXuRp6b5X7G9geA3vRXQKAoXDf4Eym2RJB3vvcBdpDQT4vbo5QX7UfeV2ddjM8s79ERUTFS2ScKggSrciUsU

We will have more details on mobile mixing forthcoming shortly.
As for ShapeShift, it is used for incoming payments where the counterpart is spending alt coins. And as for IP logging, TOR takes care of that quite nicely.

Will be very soon now. A few weeks away.
@_date: 2015-12-07 11:34:37
Still too early to say. Perhaps once we hook it all up to mobile mixing. Next up on our list.

Yes, real life application.
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:43:49
BIP47: coding is done, working on UI. Give it a couple of weeks for the public beta. Mobile mixing: end of Q1 2016.

On Android you can use Sentinel from Samourai Wallet to consult balances of individual bitcoin addresses and BIP44 accounts (via XPUB). 
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:37:14
Fully implemented in Samourai Wallet. It is included for our next alpha release.   The OBPP is doing great work in the Bitcoin space and we are happy to work to their guidelines.
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:47:28
Samourai Wallet has a stealth feature that allows it to remain hidden on the device. When in stealth launch mode you have to "dial in" to your wallet. We are now alpha testing and you can find out more at  A second alpha version will be released in the next few days and we are open sourcing very soon now. Join us. We'd appreciate your feedback.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:16:31
We'll be open sourcing upon release. Join our alpha test program and use small amounts in the meantime.
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:46:30
STONEWALL activation depends on your utxo mix and how much is being spent. 3 or more utxo for a spend that is less than 50% of the wallet will more likely than not trigger a STONEWALL. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 11:38:07
You will see BIP47 in use well before December 2016. Well before.

144 blocks is nothing. Look at P2SH adoption from its launch in 2012 until last year. It was going sideways until September 2017 and then increased steadily thanks to P2SH-P2WPKH segwit adoption.
A few points:
- many Segwit transactions cannot be counted because they were used for storing amounts on P2SH-P2WPKH addresses and used P2PKH utxo. It is not possible to count those transactions in Segwit stats. It can be assumed that many of those transaction are Segwit given the boost in P2SH usage after Segwit rollout on the network.
- many Segwit utxo cannot be counted for same reason. Spent from P2PKH and parked on P2SH.
- bech32 can always be counted within Segwit stats but is very recent and has not been widely adopted as of yet.
- Segwit aside, blockchain.info has never derived or signed a P2SH address (unless you count their ersatz in-house LN, "Thunder"). They haven't just been stalling on Segwit.
@_date: 2015-06-06 22:50:13
The current alpha version avoids spending change outputs from a same tx in the same spend.
The next release will pause before each spend and provide a privacy profile of the tx being created.
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:30:31
I'm very well aware of bc.i's goings on.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:54:59
I think that's the one, yes.
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:31:09
If the P2SH is on the input side (utxo), it is counted. Many users moved amounts *to* P2SH segwit addresses immediately after segwit activation. Those transactions have not been counted if the resulting utxo have not been spent since.

He is a major shareholder at blockchain.info and is in a position to influence product-related decisions.
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:45:26
No. Dark Wallet used a different mnemonic method of determining wallet seed. There is a conversion tool out there that converts DW mnemonic to BIP39 but it doesn't help with stealth addresses afaik.

You are free to sign up and take it for spin. No need to use large amounts. As soon as we reach 1.0 release, we open source. Thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:14:38
We are actively looking at Tor support. VPN and Tor are not mutually exclusive and many users are not Tor-savvy but do know a bit more about VPN. Just as our remote commands are optional, we are working on network anonymity solutions that will appeal to a wide range.

Download Sentinel for Android. Import XPUBs and single addresses.
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:44:53
Try Arc-Bit wallet on iOS. I'm not sure but I think they do watch only.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:56:07
We do stealth addresses in the form of BIP47. Our own backend system is under development and as soon as it is ready we will be introducing mixing.
@_date: 2016-03-02 21:19:06
Cool! BIP44 XPUBs are most often exported at account level before the derivation of external/internal chains.
@_date: 2015-05-10 16:29:24
Any multisig solution that we might work on will not be custodial.
@_date: 2017-02-05 13:23:23
If you use Android you can use Sentinel (from Samourai) as a watch only wallet. It's BIP44 so definitely compatible with Trezor.
@_date: 2016-01-12 06:16:59
Your transaction was immediately included in the blockchain but wasn't being looked at by most apps &amp; APIs. The issue was caused by taking an address from your XPUB that was more than 20 addresses up the chain from the last used address. The standard lookahead is 20 addresses. Apps and APIs are not required to look past 20 addresses for a new transaction. In this instance, the apps &amp; APIs you used were behaving correctly.
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:45:23
Check the repo. PushTx not sent to bci for a while now. Full node functionality rollout starting with next release. See you pitchforks on the other side.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:58:01
Real, yes. Quite. Show stopper? We don't think so. We have been looking at this and are working on ways to optimize syncing for incoming notification tx. We know that Justus is working on v2 of BIP47 which will modify the way notification transactions work.
@_date: 2016-01-23 08:13:18
We will be open sourcing as soon as we release to the Play Store publicly (currently in alpha). It's on our roadmap and we are on schedule.
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:48:58
Yes, very long speeches about Ethereum's upcoming conquering of all that is crypto.
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:38:55
BIP47 was designed with mobile devices and SPV in mind but there is nothing to prevent implementing it in a desktop wallet or on any other kind of platform. I know that MultiBit has been studying the question.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:36:46
Once the params are entered and the connection is verified, you need to check the box to spend through the trusted node. Unchecking the box allows you to turn off the feature without having to re-enter the params again later.
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:46:30
I found your address at index 44.
You should see your funds now. I sent some small amounts to addresses lower down the chain so now blockchain.info and mycelium will see it in their lookahead window. My guess is the smartbit.com.au is using a lookahead window of 50 or 100. The standard is 20 which is why other apps were not looking that far ahead. The other apps/API were not at fault.
To generate individual addresses safely from an XPUB (as opposed to "by hand"), use Sentinel for Android, the sister app of Samourai Wallet.  ;)
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:44:32
The BIPs fix the lookahead window at 20 addresses. Some implementations look farther ahead which would explain any API/wallet going beyond 20. When you created an address and didn't see the correct balance it was not because the transaction didn't confirm but rather because the API/wallet you were using did not look ahead more than 20 addresses and therefore did not see your transaction in order to include it in any balance calculation.
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:11:58
Sentinel monitors account level BIP44 XPUBs (path m/44'/0'/0').
@_date: 2016-01-17 11:46:51

ArcBit confirmed to us that they decided not to support BIP47. However, there is one other BIP47 wallet which will be released soon.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:24:58
Samourai Wallet will only talk to Core nodes (0.13.1 and above). Our trusted node feature does not hook up with XT, Classic, and BU nodes. Hope that clarifies.

Eventually, but not short term. In any case, quite a few of the features mentioned in this thread cannot be done on iOS without jailbreaking the device.
@_date: 2016-01-17 10:36:01
Don't forget BIP47 reusable payment codes.
@_date: 2016-01-23 09:48:12
Hey, thanks to all of you for the tips. I'll be forwarding those funds to our "company wallet" for which we will soon be communicating our BIP47 reusable payment code so that anyone who wants to donate  will be able to set up a 1-1 payment channel with us.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:48:09
BIP47 is designed from the ground up for mobile use and targeting  SPV does present certain challenges in terms of optimization and implementation of wallet recovery. We are confident that our UI will provide ease-of-use and are working on a few pre-release optimizations.

@_date: 2017-01-08 19:07:34
Use Sentinel for Android. It will accept a BIP44 account public key (XPUB) which will allow you to generate receive addresses. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:49:09
Maybe your wallet is being dusted.

Good bye. Thank you for spelling our name correctly. ;)
@_date: 2017-01-28 21:17:03
Samourai Wallet uses BIP47 payment codes which generate stealth addresses without any need for server support. Dark Wallet was working on BIP47 as well up until about a year ago.

Nothing, really... other than the fact that we are quite prepared to play cat &amp; mouse and do whatever necessary to foil their algos at every turn. Several modifications are planned already that will make Ricochets more obscure. I don't believe that fatalism is an option here. Action must be taken and within our limited means, that is exactly what we are doing.
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:02:37
Our web site clearly states that it is not a silver bullet and that it is meant to complicate things for blacklist compilers. It will evolve and, indeed, some enhancements are ready to be pushed. Others in this thread are conflating its purpose with mixing, etc.
As previously stated, our mixing solution is forthcoming.
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:11:08
Ricochet has nothing to do with tumbling. Certain actors in the bitcoin space are tracking txs, blocking accounts, and creating blacklists for certain addresses. If you transact with a certain address, you might wind up in their crosshairs because there standard practice currently is to look back 4 hops. Ricochet will create a long transaction of 5 hops to send your funds out of their line of sight. If and when they change their algos, we'll change Ricochet.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:53:06
We don't see any KYC-related functionality as being useful. Those who disagree have plenty of options to choose from. As for revenue, it should be clear by now that we are not interested in monetising via fiat.

The downside is "KYC feature creep". Providers get into the bad habit of requesting optional information which doesn't stay optional for long. We are seeing this with more regularity: 3rd party KYC options and proposals like BIP75. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:45:50
Full release when our own backend is ready. Mixing is our next project scheduled for asap.

Try Bitseed.
@_date: 2017-01-20 23:45:26
We recommend you buy expressos. They take up less block space and pack more of a punch.

Samourai Wallet's ZL implementation (Whirlpool on Android,  is now OSS and will be rolled out shortly.
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:23:33
Might be supported by a new address format later on (bech32). 
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:30:31
Mixing is our next important release. This is more about keeping your spent-to address off of snoopers' blacklists.
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:46:33
The solution is very simple: as a community, do not use Shapeshift and do not trust Erik. Build and use tools that strengthen bitcoin's fungibility and increase its privacy. Shun bad actors.
@_date: 2017-01-21 12:28:56
Depends on the spender's choice of fee. We propose 3 fee levels: low, normal, and priority.
@_date: 2017-01-20 22:46:06
1) If any user decides to do the same thing manually, he is welcome to do so. Ideally, a user should do this off of any main account for which the XPUB might be leaked. 2) If funds are effectively moved beyond line-of-sight of the actors we intend to avoid then fungibility is indeed protected. As said actors change their algos, we'll change ours. 3) Our mixing solution is in the works. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:24:41
I believe that he is back here now, so perhaps he got the memo.
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:54:48
On the basis of all the above comments, and the fact that there can only be one true Bitcoin, I will continue using the BCASH moniker. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-01-21 08:46:54
As stated elsewhere, fungibility is preserved by moving funds to an address out of the line-of-sight of ill-intentioned actors. At the moment, simple countermeasures can be effective in countering their simple blacklisting techniques. We already have changes planned and ready to be introduced as soon as they modify their algos. The intention is to stay a step ahead, increase their costs, and render their lists unreliable.
"It does cost fees..." : Yes, for better or for worse, privacy has a price.
"...and bloat the blockchain." : Personally, I don't think that this is something that will be used for every spend. It will be used when the spender has reason to believe that ill-intentioned snoops will be counting hops in an effort to pass judgement on their transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:19:22
Roger that.
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:58:07
Same wallet but not the same wallet account. The addresses are deterministic, privkeys never leave the device, and no addresses are linked to the main account XPUB.
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:16:35
We have provided support during the recent fork via: fork detection &amp; replay protection in our wallet code, and advice on how best to access one's BCASH when contacted at our tech support. Our policy is simply to not provide in-wallet support for any alt-coin.
@_date: 2017-01-21 13:06:10
Here's one outfit peddling such lists:
In addition, one very well known "on ramp" is notorious for blocking accounts &amp; funds based on backward-looking hops.

Rough estimates... priority: next block, standard: within 30min, low: within 1 hour.
The txs for Ricochets are calculated and broadcast in sequence at 10 second intervals.

No, I do not. I only speak for Samourai Wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:05:02
I am being completely honest when I respond that I have no idea why. I adopted BCASH as a short symbol for Bitcoin Cash when there arose a confusion between BCC &amp; BCH (BCC being used for another alt on some exchanges). I've never considered the term derogatory, simply more precise and leaving no room for misunderstanding.
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:56:36
Segwit addresses now have an additional encoding and can start with 'bc1'. See bech32.
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:32:42
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:40:57
Thanks for "getting" what we do. The other thing we will not do is  push users into the arms of KYC merchants (Glidera, Chashila, et al.) for the sake of monetisation.

Not really on the radar at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:56:16
The custom fee in Samourai wallet was not "hidden". It was included quickly and the UI will be updated for 1.0. Samourai allows you to set any positive fee for sat/b. I commonly use anything between 5 - 75 sat/b depending on mempool conditions.
Samourai also allows you to choose between 21.co &amp; bitcoind as your fee provider. If 21.co fees are a bit on the high side, users can switch over to bitcoind low fee or use custom fee and put what they want. If the tx takes too long to confirm they still have RBF &amp; CPFP in-wallet. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:04:08
We've been playing around with it on the code end of things. Samourai Wallet is looking into this from a product perspective. Could be included in a future update.

@_date: 2016-02-04 10:06:18
We are getting to release our implementation of BIP47 reusable payment codes. The release is forthcoming any day now. Next month we will open source our wallet. After that, we will gear up for end of Q2 release for mobile mixing.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:30:10
Our next alpha, which is days away from release, will include a BIP47 payment code that will open a donation channel to us. When we open source that, before end of March, you can download and donate. Thank you.

We have respected all of our deadlines/announcements so far. You are free to not use our wallet until it is open sourced and we fully understand why you would choose to do so. It would be nice to assume that you would come back here some time in March after we open source so you could take back your insinuations but somehow I don't think you will.

Thank you ;)
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:45:19
Yes, mnemonic + passphrase will restore your wallet, including BIP47 addresses.
@_date: 2017-04-09 18:55:59
Samourai Wallet is open source 
@_date: 2017-04-09 21:30:46
Anyone is free to fork Samourai Wallet and make the necessary modifications for Litecoin. did it, BIP47 and all ;)
@_date: 2016-02-05 14:20:57
Actually, moving to our own backend, open sourcing apps and backend, and releasing open source BIP47 and mobile mixing WILL change all of that. Whether YOU like it or not.
@_date: 2017-04-10 04:27:44

@_date: 2016-02-05 09:40:58
A quick response and then back to work:
- The method getAddressInfo() is used to determine if a single address has been already used as a receive address. The method is never called using several addresses even though it is written to include that capability. This can easily be verified in the decompiled source. The method is used in the interest of increasing privacy, not weakening it (avoid address reuse).
- We have been fairly open about the fact that we while bootstrapping in alpha mode we are going through third party APIs. I have made frequent references on Twitter and Reddit  to our ongoing backend development, which I have been overseeing. It is being done at our own expense with servers located in a privacy-friendly jurisdiction. This backend will include privacy enhancing features specifically designed for Samourai Wallet and Sentinel and will be fully open sourced.
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:09:22
Samourai Wallet has RBF (replace-by-fee) off by default. It's value can be toggled in the "Transactions" settings screen.

An interesting thread here:

Not sure I understand. It is a join. 2 different wallets on the input side.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:14:20
The feature is to be released in 7-10 days so we are still working on the documentation. Maybe you didn't see the news as it applies to bitcoin and not to scam tokens. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:23:07
So much to do ;) Watch the Mule Tools space. Pony Direct mutation incoming.

LOL. You are concerned about our build process after your scammy token raise? Please...
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:02:55
The update was released yesterday. BIP49 XPUBs supported (Trezor &amp; Ledger).
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:54:05
Samourai can export signed tx from the wallet and optionally block the inputs in that tx from being spent elsewhere so the tx can be broadcast at a later time. Our Pony Direct app will send a signed tx via SMS to the mobile phone number of your choice or to our SMS relay. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:41:57
Samourai Wallet seed will restore BIP84 account in Wasabi Wallet. Wasabi Wallet, afaik, will not restore BIP44, BIP49 or BIP47 accounts from Samourai.

Never install APKs from a "random site". The latest up-to-date version is always available via Play. We will be available on F-Droid when we release 1.0, or soon after.

Mainly privacy issues. You are giving the analytics guys a bone to chew on.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:35:11
Did you use a passphrase in addition to the 12-word mnemonic?
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:34:33
OK, then that is not a factor.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:29:01
I believe I replied briefly elsewhere. He is a more detailed reply:
- Ricochet has nothing to do with mixing but is rather a direct response to certain tactics being used currently by custodial operators and chain analysis outfits
- our mixing solution, currently in dev, is: 
- ECDH addresses (BIP47) are a great boon to privacy
Our features list is here:  and our Segwit update is due in a few days. Sentinel is already updated for handling Segwit addresses (BIP49 XPUBs).
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:07:46
We are implementing this as our mixing solution: 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:39:30
The WIF compressed private key alone will, most often and depending on the software being used, generate a P2PKH address. Generating a P2SH-P2WPKH segwit address also requires the redeem script. The redeem script is derived from the public key which itself is derived from the private key.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:41:46
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:00:05
No lag, just much extra testing. Segwit update is coded and looks good. We are testing Segwit release thoroughly with our different spend types. Here's a testnet tx from a few days ago:

We support RBF (replace-by-fee) and find it useful, especially when miner fees are an issue. However, RBF is 'off' by default and must be turned on in the app settings. Samourai Wallet will also warn about incoming RBF transactions so the user is aware and can act appropriately.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:53:07
You can send funds to bech32 addresses (starting w/ 'bc') from Samourai Wallet.

As for any tech issues such as you describe, please contact us at support so we can work with you. Of course, having your seed written down is a requirement for using any BIP32/44 wallet. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:05:00
Can't be more precise than that. We are testing now and a good part of the code is already operational in Sentinel so it shouldn't be long at all.

We will be updating soon with replay protection for the possible 2X fork.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:12:00
IMO, there is little point in trying to pre-load your wallet with compatible amounts. Let BIP126 do the work for you. Typically though, you need to keep over 3 utxo in the wallet (more, if possible) and avoid spending half or more of the total balance.
We are working on using BIP126 in conjunction with wallet efficiency scores as measured by  , so expect our implementation to undergo a few changes soon.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:15:53
We are working on the issue and communicating w/ OP via support channel.

If I'm not mistaken, Trezor is working on proposed modifications to extended public keys that will include the 'purpose' so that XPUB for BIP44 and BIP49 can be easily differentiated. See this thread:

@_date: 2018-04-01 21:11:48
New Relic is not a spyware.
Nevertheless, we do not want it to be associated and downloaded with anything we provide for our users. We provide a copy of Ian Colemen's BIP39 tools for stand-alone use by our users who wish to access their private keys offline.
As was promptly investigated and explained when you reported it:
1) It's not a keylogger or spyware.
2) Our tech support host inserts it into the uploaded page. We discovered this after your report and numerous attempts on our behalf to upload the page without the script. 
3) We replaced the uploaded html page with a zip file of the same page which is not modified when uploading to our support host.

Coin control as in utxo selection? If so, you can mark utxos as "do not spend" to obtain a sort of inverse coin control. This feature is being further developed for future updates.

Samourai Wallet is the only one to date. Other BIP47 compliant  implementations are on the way.
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:38:53
See you in March 2016 ;)
@_date: 2018-04-12 09:12:29
Depends on whether or not the addresses are derived deterministically. Simple script should do the job either way.
@_date: 2015-11-19 17:43:23
It is only mandatory in that 1 byte is set aside for it in the payment code. I think that some implementations might not support that feature and the byte will be set to zero.
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:30:34
Not sure what you mean by "tagged" here. Are you referring to notification tx? If so, only they are "tagged", all other spend tx are not identifiable as belonging to a payment code scheme other than to the payer/payee.
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:15:35
The code will be opened source in Q1 of 2016. We are on schedule for all of our milestones so I do not foresee any delay.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:11:24
Nice suggestion. Thank you.
Currently, Sentinel queries via a secured connection to a 3rd party API. We are developing our own backend service which will replace this and also serve as a the backend for Samourai Wallet, of which Sentinel is a fork. All is scheduled to be open sourced early next year.
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:57:20
It also has the advantage of being "Blockchain Alliance" unfriendly.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:05:32
So bitcoin users who run nodes are "hobbyists"? That's a condescending smear if ever there was one.
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:17:00
There are a few things we would like to do before open sourcing: flesh out the feature set a bit more and finish development on our own backend system (which will be open sourced as well). We are still in close beta currently and will be in open beta shortly. The 'beta' classification will be dropped end of Q1 and then we move to open source.

Erik used the words "should not" in his own tweet.
@_date: 2015-11-19 08:55:34
We certainly hope to be first ;) but not the only ones either as we are looking forward to a vibrant BIP47 space for wallet users. In any case, after coding the generation of payment codes, handling of notification txs and matching addresses for Alice &amp; Bob, our test vectors are now being verified. UI work has started and we shall roll out BIP47 support as soon we have a stable build.
As soon as v2 details are released we will start working on that as well.
Oh, and since there is no rest for the wicked, we've started work on mobile mixing.
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:51:58
Try our Sentinel app on Android. We've just updated it to handle multiple BIP44 XPUBs and/or individual bitcoin public addresses (including P2SH).
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:44:40
No good reason other than that there might be some implementations out there that do skip addresses on the internal chain and we want to show the expected balance nonetheless. That's also the reason why we will be increasing our lookahead beyond 20 as soon as some backend systems dev is complete.

The latest update 0.98.26 fixed a bug that appeared in the previous version that directly affected the "own node" option. Perhaps that is what is causing your issue. If you haven't updated, please do so. If that's not it, contact us at support . Thanks.

Have a look at the BIP itself. It's clearly explained and the charts are very helpful :   Look for our Samourai Wallet implementation real-soon-now. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:23:13
Actually, based on tweets made by the people mentioned in that statement, including your own, it is entirely accurate.
@_date: 2015-11-08 09:35:33
Samourai Wallet has an implementation of BIP47 payment codes (stealth addresses for mobile wallets) coming out very soon. The actual implementation coding of BIP47 is done and we are working on a very easy-to-use UX/UI for integration to our wallet.

As stated here by : we are solid supporters of Dark Wallet and all their efforts. Samourai Wallet did not fork from their code base. Dark Wallets devs reached out to us once we published the BIP47 test vectors so they could replicate, which they did. We are looking forward to interoperability (hopefully very soon) between our two wallets for all BIP47 reusable payment code users.

Sentinel (like Samourai Wallet) works with the "standard" 20 address lookahead. We are considering bumping this up to a higher number in a near term release.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:55:34
Your tweet says "99.99% of Bitcoin users should not run a full node." You obviously don't want them to. Doesn't jibe at all with "Running a full node is great. The more the better." Make up your mind.   
@_date: 2016-05-21 09:51:04
Yes, Samourai Wallet supports BIP47 reusable payment codes and is now open sourced.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:27:17
Other than that we plan to do it, nothing is yet in the starting blocks. Quite a few features will not be moved over to iOS when we do make the move.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:16:57
We expect to carry out the first spends using BIP47 in the next few days. Once we can perform end-to-end spends we'll properly package the code and start integrating it all into a proper UI which is already very well advanced design-side.

Sentinel does not currently support multisig XPUBs. It is guaranteed to work with BIP44 XPUBs presently. Multisig XPUBs are being studied on a case-by-case (provider) basis for future updates.
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:23:53
Currently Sentinel works with a standard lookahead of 20. This will be bumped up in a future release.

Your BIP39 passphrase is correct or you would not have seen the PIN code reminder. The passphrase and your mnemonic will restore your funds in any BIP39/44 wallet. Please give that a try.
@_date: 2015-10-25 09:59:28
Thanks! At Samourai HQ we are using the multiple account capability all the time now.
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:11:06
Patched update should be propagating anytime now. We noticed that just after pushing to Play Store and made the change.
@_date: 2015-11-19 10:47:59
A lookahead window is managed just like BIP32/BIP44. If a gap of addresses contain 0 tx, the wallet client stops looking for tx.
@_date: 2015-10-26 09:15:47
Sentinel indeed *does* support single Bitcoin addresses since the latest update.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:57:23
iOS would probably not include: stealth launch (hiding the app icon and launching by other means), remote commands via SMS (along with 'trusted number' functionality), and remote SIM switch warning. We'd have to see how we could implement those features differently, if at all.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:34:33
I'm not seeing that behaviour at all. Custom fee works as expected -- non-sticky, and the most recent preset fee is the default.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:39:54
We are releasing CPFP shortly. Just some UI/UX issues to iron out.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:12:18
Custom fee is not "sticky". There are 3 predetermined fee levels: low, regular, and high. The one of these 3 settings that is selected will remain as the default fee. Updated fees are fetched upon every refresh and this could explain why they fluctuate from time to time. Fees UI/UX will continue to evolve.

State of play is full speed ahead. Our second alpha is out and we are working hard to get to prod asap. Watch for Sentinel and Samourai updates in short order. Many more details forthcoming.
@_date: 2015-11-18 21:59:37
We have worked with Justus on getting this implemented asap. The actual address generation is coded and well tested. We've submitted some test vectors to Justus and are now working on our UI for getting this into our Android app.

Your remark about "hobbyists" was condescending. Roger's remark about "anarchists" being able to go off and create a new coin if Bitcoin turns into Paypal2.0 was condescending (The Crypto Show). It's becoming repetitious.
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:29:55
I assume by "incentive" you mean economic incentive. I would argue that strengthening the network's capability to validate transactions and its decentralisation are incentive enough. If you are a hodler then  that "is" economic incentive.

Our Whirlpool implementation will be released shortly. Stop by t.me/SamouraiWallet and join the discussion.
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:25:30
The issues were backend related, as in, we momentarily did not have  a backend doing the heavy lifting. We will patch the app to fail more gracefully when such conditions arise and your crash report id very helpful to that end.
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:01:18
During our bootstrap phase, XPUBs are sent over https to API servers to obtain balances and transaction lists. The XPUBs are not connected to any wallet or user id. Users concerned about the visibility of their IP address can use VPN/Tor on their device (this can be used directly from Samourai Wallet). 
Our own backend is currently under development. It will function as above with added privacy enhancements and will be open sourced along with the rest of our software.
As an added note: BIP47 payment codes will provide increased privacy. They are now being tested in early implementations on our side.

The app requires your BIP44 mnemonic/seed.
Yes, it uses CPFP for both receives &amp; sends.
The wallet is restored app-side on the device. The user should wipe the wallet/uninstall once they boost their transaction.

Sounds like the Localbitcoin.com price. Just switch to a different exchange if you don't want the street price. On iOS, Mycelium has a watch only feature.

The wallet is restored app-side on the device. The seed/keys never leave the device and are encrypted app-side. The user should wipe the wallet/uninstall once they boost their transaction.

If it's a BIP44 wallet you can use Sentinel for Android.
