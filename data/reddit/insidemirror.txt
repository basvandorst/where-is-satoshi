I don't think the downfall is over or I don't want it to be over yet. :P
gotta accumulate my one tenth millionth BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:11:21
thanks mate
@_date: 2019-01-08 05:49:51
That's awesome. thanks for trying. how much fees did the transaction incur and how many hopes did it take? When i tried there was one hop in between and fees was 1 sat. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:04:05
I see. I personally had 3 channels opened already with each having rank &lt; 200. The transaction went through one of them and took less than 2 seconds. It was smooth for me. And yeah transaction did time out for me as well but for blockstream only. i did couple of payments for y'all it all went fine with single try. 
There is no denial more the number of ln nodes, the stronger the network is gonna get and m proud to say m doing my part ��

current account :P
@_date: 2018-12-26 18:08:00
I am actually. Installed ZapDesktop and added my own node in wallet settings along with cert and macaroon.
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:58:31
really good video. got a feeling like am watching a movie or something 
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:04:09
agreed. you have control over your funds all the time and can settle on payment channel whenever you wish to. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:12:58
UTXO as in?
Sorry but I don't understand why everyone is putting emphasis on "MUST use FIFO or LIFO".   
Can you please help me understand?
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:10:27
last time when i filed taxes, I used combination of methods, not just FIFO.  
Excuse my lack of knowledge here but is the following a IRS rule?


jfyi, I tried using a Single Method i.e. FIFO for everything, m still sitting at a loss of  \~1.9K which is pretty close to what I had earlier. So if I happen to use FIFO, will I be okay?
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:01:59
current account, sure. but credit card i don't agree. you're not borrowing to spend. Its your own btc held in payment channel. You can settle whenever you wish to. Plus, You're not paying any interest on using spending any of that btc. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:59:19
i haven't seen any rule saying you must settle every month. And it's your own bitcoin that you send to the contract, not borrowing or anything so i don't think its related to cc in any manner. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:14:25
Another question on similar note: does using FIFO ensures, me not violating wash sale rule?
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:32:18
Wait for it to finish synching first, bud.
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:26:15
seriously huge
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:08:06
I should have mentioned it. I will add a note. Thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:22:09
i never heard about it actually. thanks a lot. i will look into it. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:02:08
that doesn't matter. As long as you made profit, you gotta pay tax on it. How much you ask, that depends upon following factors:
* Short Term or Long Term?
* For Short Term:  whatever your current tax bracket is.
* For long term: 0%-20%.
Country: USA
Note: As pointed out by USD is going to be the base currency. no matter if you are doing fiat to crypto, crypto to fiat or crypto to crypto transactions.  
It's gets really complicated to maintain it by yourself sooner than you except. I tried via google sheet but too hard to keep things in sync. I personally use [BitcoinTaxes]( to manage it all. It's pretty simple for non-traders like myself. Totally worth it.
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:23:34
you got me. Although I would call in Social **Revolution**.  
I admit I entered the crypto with the intent to make profit but after understanding the technology and realizing what it can do, falling prices don't bother me.
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:20:40
again that's internal satisfaction bud. i think he was talking about making some btc by processing payments and all
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:56:12
Then its going to zero and I wouldn't feel bad knowing I invested in something I understand and accept the fact that I was wrong  
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:22:19
Please excuse my dumb question.  I don't see anybody specifying any receiving btc addresses here so where are the tips going? ��
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:00:29
can someone please explain whats DCA strategy?
@_date: 2018-12-26 23:51:29
Apart from the internal satisfaction, No.
Once enough people are running these node and enough merchants are accepting lightening payments, its going to be huge, especially in case of small and micropayments. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:33:37
bitcoin bubble popped,
stock market popped.
Next debt?
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:35:06
i would be very interested to know how do you interpret it?
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:11:16
Because crypto is solving some serious problems:
Removing middlemen
Increasing transparency 
Decentralization 
Programmable Money
Where as in stock all but few care about bigger and bigger margins. They don't give a shit about any of their customers. Take AAPL, AMZN, MSFT for example, what problem are they trying to solve. TSLA is there with clear and real mission but guess what it is the most shorted stock. It's all about money there. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:48:07
yeah former federal prosecutor. I loved the way she narrated the whole story. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:09:30
I was acting crazy til June 2018 i.e. buying crypto with whatever money I could get my hands on, including borrowing from my margin account. Thinking "**thats it this is bottom".** It's so hilarious now that I think about it.
But since then I made a simple rule. Take $X from every paycheck (no more no less) and buy crypto(mainly BTC). And I am planning to do that until BTC hits $10,000. I am still in huge loss as well but I have peace of mind. These low prices don't even bother me. In fact, I am happy because with the same money I can buy more.  
TLDR; Don't try to catch the bottom. Nobody Knows. Keep on accumulating while you can.
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:51:56
Thanks mate. I understand and believe in the technology. Especially after experiencing lightening network myself. If it all happens to go to zero, I would be fine and not blaming someone else for it. 
On the other note, you gotta invest extra cash somewhere. I feel better about crypto then stock market. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:26:21
I don't think he those kinda perks 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:48:37
supperrr funny
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:27:50
as per my understanding lightening network is like having checking account. use it for day to day transactions. where hardware wallet or cold storage is like savings account.
