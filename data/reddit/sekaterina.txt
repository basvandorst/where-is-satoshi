And i think that's the whole goal of it all. ETH getting bad press, will get Bitcoin bad press. Anytime fools' about to part their ways from their moneys en masse, the SEC interferes.
Don't you think it's odd that banks which usually does everything to keep SEC at bay and far away, are all of sudden comfying up with SEC and wanting them to interfere when their scam fiat is being threatened ... ? ;)

Core devs are supposed to be the guardians.
"BTC1" would be open to the fuckery of the few rich people. It is not for the benefit of all at all, got to be dumb moron not to realize that ... Oh well, average joe is pretty dumb and half of the people are even dumber than that
Unless we have *The Guardians Of The Blockchain* at the helm, making super conservative decisions, we might end up the BTC1 chain being no better than FIAT or Ethereum. Both of which are scams in the massive scale, but people just go with it coz' they don't f*cking know better nor have a choice in the matter.
For these miners making decisions, stopping the block halving might be beneficial for them and infinite supply. Then we truly are f*cked

Lol, it's exactly that. A currency. Not money. ETH has no inherent value what so ever. Scam to begin with and now we see secondary cycle of scams with ICOs

It all boils down: Ethereum is just an attack against Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies).
Big banks - Federal Banks, those who actually control money, are afraid. Bitcoin and crypto is taking their power away from them.
Thats one of the reason we see these attacks constantly, even the alternative bitcoin clients etc. Ethereum is just a bit more sophisticated attack.
This is the trumping up stage for Ethereum, and when it inevitable crashes, banks will win. They will damage Bitcoin. Seriously.
Even if Ethereum does not crash after all these ponzies (Ethereum is a Ponzi of Ponzies), they win, by having such a hold over it. Vitalik is just a patsy. Ethereum's premine most likely was to get most Ethereum into the hands of the powers that be.
FIAT is perfect system for the banksters right now. They want to either destroy bitcoin or bring that same magnificent fraud to cryptocurrencies.
Just ask, why all of sudden big banks have regulators as their best friends. They are not even too shy about wanting to destroy bitcoin. They don't trump it, they don't advertise it, but they are not being too secretive about it neither.

Your instinct is right. ETH is a scam, waiting to burst.
Just make sure you anticipate the bursting of the scam bubble, and sell right prior to it.

good for ya, sensing the scam.
72mil out of 92mil premined.

it's odd how people are so stupid they fail to see those 2 factors are the reason of success for BTC, and the lack of those 2 is the reason every single fiat currency has failed eventually since the dawn of time. ETH is just like any fiat currency. More shall be printed!
"but it's blockchain!" -- well that does not guarantee anything.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:03:22


and unfortunately this is exactly what the big banks wanted to happen :(
War is being fought. People realize the scam of fiat currency, and eth is no better. However, the failure of eth will put bitcoin on bad light as well "but it was blockchain based!". it's all of a war campaign by the powers that be to keep that power

ETH is not going to overtake BTC in market cap, not real market cap anyways. IT's just a fucking scam, ponzi of ponzies.
There is 92mil of ETH, 72mil of which was premined &amp; ICO (friends &amp; family needs to get rich too), public just to make it look like it is not all going to friends. Then there are ETH ICOs which tie up who knows how much of the remaining, then there is the miner HODLers. Actual float remaining is what, maybe 4mil coins? That's what makes the actual market cap. Rest is just you lot getting scammed and arse f**ked. Fools and their money is about to part ways.
ETH is nothing but an attack on bitcoin and blockchain. Banks are embracing it because they can do what the fuck they please with it, without fools realizing it. Just like they don't realize the scam that is fiat currency. they will just htink cos' its blockchain they cant just print it. fools.

It is a **power grab** plain and simple.
They want to take control of bitcoin, leave the core devs who have taken extremely good care of it so far in the dust.
There was actual *technical* issues with SegWit2x as well, never mind the people behind this are not technically savvy enough to make this change safely at all.
Core has remained neutral in the sense that they think of the Big Picture. Block size increase was as well in Satoshi's vision, and afaik some of the core developers are looking into how to bring it to the 32MB size set originally by Satoshi. It was only restricted to 1MB to prevent spam when TXs were free.
