Wasn't there just an analysis done that showed that like 90%+ of traffic/trades on exchanges were fake, done simply to make the exchanges appear busy in order to sucker in more of that sweet Fiat everyone actually wants.

A Billion! There.

Except you really can barely buy anything, anywhere with bitcoins. Nobody really wants them. Now USD fiat... That's accepted almost everywhere and you can actually BUY stuff with it almost anywhere.

Probably not.

Most countries hold their national reserves in USD. Most Uber wealthy invest or store in USD. Super stable and the whole world is invested in it and invested in keeping it's value up. Cause everyone has it and all international trade is done in USD. Bitcoins are almost entirely useless unless converted to Fiat so u can actually use them.

Spoiler: It never will. It's best time is behind it.

Yeah... until you need to actually USE the stuff and need to pass it through the same old financial system.
You think governments are going to allow tax avoidance and anonymity via bitcoin you are delusional.
If you think governments wont be able to stop you... think again.

Does 7-zip use the same DLL? Imma check.

Is the network really that resistant to attack? Like if a modern country (the usa for instance) decided to DDOS all the exchanges, then launch cyber attacks against anything they can touch online... That'd prettty much kill it no?

Came here to say something like this...
Looks like mostly crime.

China went from 1.17 trillion to 1.12 trillion. Don't hold your breath.

It's essentially just a secure ledger... It's not really suited to the task.
@_date: 2019-02-23 01:09:56
Or... it's overvalued by about $4k. We're gonna find out.

It's sort of like having stocks in a company that doesn't make anything and doesn't actually exist.
@_date: 2019-04-22 11:28:58
Very, very unlikely. What would you buy it with? The currency that just feel out of favor? It's value is measured in USD...
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:16:16
That's actually pretty cool. I never noticed any Bitcoin options on Amazon. Of course, I never looked. Are they there or is it more complicated than that?

Bitcoin - impossible to spend, almost everywhere.
Edit: to mention that I'm just jelly cause I got none.
@_date: 2019-04-29 03:04:17
More than trust. So many people/countries hold it they all have an interest in not letting it's value slip. Self preservation keeps the dollar afloat. But, honestly, wtf do I know. I'm fuckin poor.

Why lose 1.9 when you can hodl and lose everything, right?

One time Pad? AFAIK even a quantum computer can't break that.
