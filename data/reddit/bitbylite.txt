Well I bought in a couple years ago thinking that digital currencies and crypto currencies were the future and people would want a place to store them and use them safely like traditional bank accounts.

Yeah. Professionalism and high EI are lacking in general.

This is terrible sorry. Let’s hope there is just a delay. One of my btc deposits took almost an hour today so maybe something is off.

I hope this isn’t the case. I think you’ll have access once they reopen if not sooner. Forced to hold worst case. Praying for you.

The part I’m confused about is why people think Bitcoin has the potential to be the average mans currency. I get one coin can be subdivided but there are many average people in this world who can’t afford it, don’t have access to constant internet or wireless services to use it or the equipment and knowledge base to mine it. 
I’m sure if they worked for it, they would see similar pay as fiat except there will most likely be a cap on earnings due to its finite nature. 
Finally, it seems like it’s just like fiat in the sense that a small group will control most of the wealth. Sure, it’s a new group and initially earned through meritocracy and risk taking but once second generation and so on inherit bitcoin, why wouldn’t they act in a similar fashion to current elites?
I agree crypto as it is now is stateless but what’s stopping states from jumping in and making it state based?m through regulations and licensing. 
Finally, when pricing BTC, it’s priced against traditional currency. That’s how the value is understood easily so why bash one side of the equation? Can’t fiat and crypto continue to work together peacefully?
Sorry if these are dumb questions. I do own a very small amount of BTC for speculative purposes. I plan I on buying more to diversify my total savings and investments portfolio with the hopes of seeing excellent returns. 
Thanks in advance.
