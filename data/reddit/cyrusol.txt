Auf den Ruf der Handelspartner und Handelsplätze zu achten ist sicherer als auf staatliche Verspechen zu hören, die nur durch Raub - 'tschuldigung, Steuern - eingehalten werden können. Klar, so denken nicht viele. Die Masse denkt eher wie du und deshalb hast du auch recht, was die Verbreitung in der breiten Masse angeht.

The morally sound option would be to speak to the public and tell the people "Hey, I'm the original author of that! He is a worthless copycat!"
You would be surprised of the positive outcome for you and the negative outcome for the copycat. Especially if it's in more than just 1 case. Good reputation is the single most valuable resource in a free world. That's why people are beginning to dislike BitGo now.
In many cases IP laws didn't protect the original authors but the first copycat. More information at [Everything is a Remix]( Original authors most of the time wrote songs to enjoy other people around them and themselves. Then big, famous bands (like Led Zeppelin, that kind of big) copied them - they were free to do so - and their managers put up a 70 year copyright claim on it, preventing the original authors from playing those songs for the sake of joy.
Originally IP laws were enacted not to actually protect the author but to make him more willing to publish his invention/creation. The __5 years__ "you are allowed to be the only one to profit off this" clause was just a mere compensation, not the actual goal of the law.
Coca Cola has proven that the most effective way to prevent an invention from being copied is to keep it as a secret. Until the 70s (or was it 80s?) nobody was able to find out the exact composition of Coca Cola since it was _not_ patented.

Sorry, English is not my mother tongue. Could you please describe what _remittance_ actually means? Or what Trump meant with: 


The dictionary I'm using translates remittence as a word for sending someone money. Somewhere else it is described for debt paid in a foreign currency.
It doesn't make sense to me, or at least not in this context.

You have refuted absolutely nothing by now. To say "it's not" is not an argument. It's a thesis. My argument stems fromt he inherent architecture of the blockchain. It can work. For a limited time if only a very small (like right now) percentage of the world's population ever deal with Shitcoin. Any application beyond that just means that everyone spends all his internet volume (those poor souls with limited volumes...) and disk space for an eternally immutable history of every transaction. Show how that works for &gt;7 billion people for just a few decades, I dare you.

There are 7 billion people that intend to use money and internet will spread.


Which further backs up my point.
@_date: 2019-11-09 11:20:50
Alright. Let's deconstruct what you've said step by step!


Eh. The main function of a bank to the people who deposit their money - in the past and today - is growing your capital through credit and investment. Look at how they advertise themselves, look at how people decide to which bank they go, on what terms.


About 25% (educated guess! but the percentage doesn't really matter anyway) of all women in the Western world have nude pics made of themselves at some point and a huge lot of them store them on someone else's PC and then are completely baffled how someone else could have accessed them and then deny partial responsibility. The average citizen is so extremely tech illiterate they really don't understand they are slowly, voluntarily devlivering themselves into slavery.
You simply cannot expect those careless and outright stupid people to _ever_ understand the relatively benign principles of cryptography, let alone its intrinsics or even just the need for (encrypted) backups for their private data.
We've seen the consequences of that ignorance already: They trust online service to keep their bitcoin wallets safe enough and then wonder how these just went away, and their money with them.


They pale in comparison.


Kickstarter is famous for one thing: People who are utterly clueless losing their money on ventures that keep on drawing more money from more people because they're lost deep in the sunken cost fallacy. Look at Star Citizen.


That's what I was aiming at when saying you want to replace the thing with the same thing. This is _precisely_ the description of a modern bank. Or one of its many instruments: fonds. It's what they do.
You would need to describe a huge qualitative difference between a traditional bank and this envisioned kind of investment-organization-but-not-a-bank-trust-me. Just them operating with crypto currencies doesn't cut it. As some banks do that today already.


I mean, _truely physical_ banks were outdated in the 90s already when the internet spreaded. I myself trust my capital to a bank that's strictly an online bank and has no branch _anywhere_ on the globe and its buildings consist almost entirely of offices for online and telephone communication.
That technological update didn't change the nature of banks in any way.


I'm a software dev. I laugh at two things about crypto currencies in general: their environmental impact (energy demand) and the stupid masses who will forever fail to use them appropriately. Precisely because I understand it. I also laugh the behavior of people here on who so obviously demonstrate overly emotional behaviour when it comes to business decisions. And I laugh at your post because it didn't contain anything new but in hindsight that was petty of me.


The internet was revolutionary because it defeated the information asymmetry in a lot of cases because it made remote communication cost almost nothing and be instant.
The Chinese emperor Yangdi organized huge projects to connect the rivers of China with canals. A good decision overall and vastly benefitial to China's domestic market back then. But he was assassinated because he had no way of knowing that the terrible labour conditions of his subordinates made them so angry they thought they were better of without him after seeing him on his majestic, pompous trip through the canal. If there was an internet he would have known the mob was unruly and he wouldn't have gone on the trip and probably sent soldiers to silence the mob instead.
The advantages of crypto currencies are negated as long as there are people who trust other people with their digital wallets. And if they wouldn't do so their wallets wouldn't have to be digital ones in the first place for the fractional reserve system to vanish.


There are a few good applications for something that is essentially a log file that cannot be manipulated after being written, yes, but it's by far not as revolutionary or disruptive as some past inventions.
@_date: 2019-11-08 21:31:19
In your case you want to replace an existing thing ... with essentially the same thing. The revolution is now, I guess?

Well, it's you, the ignorant optimist, who will have a rude awekening. The one guy who happens to be nVidia's CEO and who is actually in line with what many other people in the hardware industry say too is perhaps much more knowledgeable than a Bitcoin-solves-everything circlejerk boi. If you want to refute any of that how about trying with arguments and examples instead of repeating a thesis over and over again until someone naive enough finally, accidentally starts to believe it?

@_date: 2019-03-21 23:21:52
Your assumption is incorrect. Bitcoin is a lost cause, and PayPal knows it. Your only option to prove otherwise would be to do a better job than payment service providers, banks and escrows that operate with actual money together. By now you are only filling up the blockchain on everybody's harddrive, and that with just 1 bil. 1 bil is nothing.
@_date: 2019-03-03 14:59:04
No, I have not.
@_date: 2019-03-03 12:56:45
No, it's realistic. Can't expect to forever store all past transactions. It's not scaleable. SegWit etc. doesn't change anything, it just postpones the inevitable death of BTC. And not long enough to outlive the death of mankind.
It was a nice experiment but now it's over.

@_date: 2017-01-11 17:13:10
While Friedman is 100% on spot that's not an answer to the question why buses don't have seatbelts.
The reason is much more primitive. At least where I'm from there have been busses with seatbelts. But nobody used them.
(Of course from there follows that the lack of demand is responsible, not the lack of supply.)
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:07:54
Yes, that's true (people just not using seatbelts).
However, how does the people riding the busses not being the ones buying the busses make the bus producers responsible for the actions of those who buy busses?

If you have a lot of those available their value _to you_ drops.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:04:32
By that logic "everything is a bubble". Value is **never** intrinsic. Value is always subjective. Even in those cases where the value would be derived by the use something may provide to you the value of that use is subjective. It is inherently different from individual to individual.
Just because the value of something is not intrinsic doesn't make it a bubble though.
A bubble is characterized by hordes of people greatly overestimating the value of something for whatever reason. For Apple stocks for example because of the emotional attachment stock holders have for Apple. It is way above the monetary value represented by the company.
(Monetary value is the value you believe you get from other people by changing something in for yet another good/service.)
Whether Bitcoin's value is now greatly overestimated or just was greatly underestimated all those years I don't know.
