Yes.  That's called making money off speculation, day traders do it all the time.  The people who live in are not doing that for the most part.

You have absolutely no clue what you are talking about. 
I would say you are more like a complete idiot. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:12:02
Smooth sailing in the sea of decreasing value. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:31:32
You're talking to zealots dude.  These people would still believe Bitcoin was going to take over the world even if the price dropped backed to under $1.
Also isn't it funny how the value of Bitcoin is measure in dollars?
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:18:37
Except Bitcoin is not a stock, it has no inherent value, and is way to vulnerable to pump and dump.  Only and idiot would hold from almost $20K to $7k. 
A price drop of over 50% of value in any currency would be foreseeable in any other non-crypto currency.

Except things do have inherent value.  Cars, gas, computers, coal, bread,  q-tips.  They all have inherent value. 
Dollars bills don't inherent value, but the faith that people have in the Unites States of America's government.  O and before you say something dumb, oil all around the world is sold and traded in dollars.  Saudi Arabia sells its oil in dollars.  Drug dealers around the world sell drugs in dollars. Rich people in China have US accounts with their retirements funds in dollars.

Nobody thinks Ttat1984 is a shill.  Just that he is incredibly stupid and has no idea what he is talking about.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:06:19
But dollars do have value when they are backed by the United States government.   Nothing is backing Bitcoin.  And their is no regulation and it's far to easy to be exploited by pump and dumpers, it's happened twice now. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:23:53
Except for confidence in the currency, inherent value, regulation.
Yeah, go buy a house with Bitcoin, you may lose all its value when the price of bitcoin drops more than 50% but hey, you can always keep saying "hodl gais!!!11!!1"
O and lets not forget the week long transaction times. O and now you may be facing huge tax bills.

Why would anyone hold from almost $20k to $7K???  That doesn't seem smart.
Also it kind of shows how you have no clue what you are doing. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:48:03
The guy is an idiot and I doubt he actually owns a business.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:11:38
That's the funny part.  How long has it been going down now???  
They need to reverse the direction of that second pic. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:04:01
All of it, everything you said.  Literally everything you said was wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:36:54
You didn't lose money because the value of the dollar decreased shit for brains. You lost money because you bought property at an inflated value.
Everything you keep saying shows you have zero clue about anything and how completely fucking stupid you are. 
How come I didn't lose money???  I use dollars for everything I buy, yet I didn't lose money... hmmmm weird.   How come Best Buy, for example, stock price went from $27 in 2016 to over $70 today??????
So Best Buy made money through the sub-prim mortgage collapse???  WHAAAAAT?????
Maybe because Best Buys value is not in the property they own but in their retail business????

Can you just say "hold".  If you guys want to be taken seriously at least start speaking like adults.
