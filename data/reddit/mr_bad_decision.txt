Our future, ladies and gentleman... we’re all screwed.

The BCH debacle is not enough for me to close my account. I have always been a Gemini supporter but I find convenience in using Coinbase's auto deposit schedule. Makes it really easy to invest by dollar-cost averaging. I don't keep funds on either site so I can't comment on which is better in that case.
I have submitted a request to Gemini for this feature so that I can move away from Coinbase. For those wishing to close their Coinbase accounts, be sure to submit feature requests to Gemini so they know what their users are looking for in an exchange!

Don’t you think “fuck btc” is a bit harsh? You do realize you would have made great gains either way? Have you done the math or just looking to get upvotes in this subreddit?
A bit strange to blame either side for believing in their investment. Glad your decision worked out for you.

You don’t pay taxes on buy orders, only on a sells. Length of ownership determines tax rate, not the year of purchase. You may want to time your sell orders but I don’t see a purpose the other way around.

Though my post was not disingenuous. I don’t reply to posts often but I guess his age and language was compelling enough to get my fingers moving. 
Better to invest in the technology you believe than to time the market. Most would agree at this point both coins have a lot of room to grow.

Yes I know what you meant. You put in your original post. My questions are still valid. Nobody is trolling, your post is just the new norm. Just unfortunate.

My payments are failing on 
The Blockachino comes up correct on my wallet but when I hit send I get the message "Send Payment Failed
Payment failed to send. This can happen due to temporary network connectivity issues or an unexpected server error."
I'm using the HTLC.me wallet

Anyone else notice on version 1.1.18, the confirm receive address monitor button is missing on Segwit wallets?

I wouldn't bother looking at value of BCH/USD but rather BCH/BTC. If you hodl and wait for positive news out of China you may have a better trade opportunity. I would say now is not the time IMHO.

You would have one less person in the workforce. :D
