I got that insight yesterday.  Actually sometimes I am trying to discuss the upcoming financial crisis  and probably hyperinflation with friends of mine and the relatives (I think not too often, but who knows..) so already I am well-known with these conversations. The usual answer is a kind of laughing and "O, You again with your dark predictions!","ha-ha-ha" and "he-he-he".. or some boredom from mine "fantasies".
  
We are pretty small and will not safe the world, but REMEMBER - BTC will be Your ark to safe Yourself and Your family when the current financial system crashes (I hope You believe me more than my friends).  
*(i AM not AN ARTIST in all, so sorry for the quality of mine "art" but You got the idea. I will be happy if a real artist makes some more impressive paint of it)*

once he mentioned Bulgaria, all I had to do is to take a look at the background signages, to type in google search with the help of  "маргарита тереиева office bulgaria" and to find the correct location (from the second try), so I went to street view to look at the corner and.. that`s all :)

He said: **"What made me attracted to Bitcoin is I know the magic number is 21 million, and I know that Math is protecting me … With government, they can print another trillion dollars, and that is the biggest challenge. I know we can lead to chaos if we deny government rights to control the financial side of things, but we are already sliding into chaos because the governments are irresponsible. They create all this money, and 85 percent of it ends up in the stock market, it does not find its way to the real economy, we are basically just propping up the stock market. It is another big bubble. With Bitcoin, you have an ordinary man or woman in the street having a knowledge of the process."** !!

It is NOT what a BITCOIN DEVELOPER can do.
You need a WEBSITE DEVELOPER; integration with BTC gateway is simple.

Look for the nearest bitcoin ATM - you will be able to get it instantly and if you are fortunated enough even without KYC

Finally I can see some common posts like that one. First time after 2011 people start to understand that the bitcoin isn't to speculate but to COMPLETELY REPLACE the current monetary system! Welcome a board!

1) I will grab their attention! I hope more people will just start to understand that bitcoin is real payment instument that works into the real word.
Few days ago I was at an BTC ATM and saw an young men to look wondering WTF is that. I introduced him and let him see how to buy/sell BTC here. "Wow - he said - it`s something new here, I never saw it before" - Nope, that machine is here from ..two years and he just passed away as it never grab his attention (Just an ATM od some bank or something..)
Imagine it is a vending machine and he comes for a snack or something. First he could be a bit dissapointed he can not buy with his coins, but then he could be interested in that payment method, could understand that he can use BYC in the real world and can do that for seconds. I will be happy if I can introduce that way even a dosen of people.
2) May be now. But after year. After 2 years? I believe it will be widely used and the people will already know where my machine is and where they could spent some satoshis.

Within few years fiat will burst and all of us will be millionaires.. however a cup of coffee could be something like $10 000. At that time
1) BTC will be MUCH MORE that 5m
2) BTC will be your only way to escape poverty
3) Google for Venezuela for better understanding.

non-phisical gols is a pure s*it; so what do You preffer - to walk around/pass borders/fly with 10-20-50 kilos of precious gold (LOL) or with a flashdrive or nothing except memorized coupleof seed words?
2) phisical gold has not liquidity as BTC has and could be traded directly for various goods very difficult.
3) YOU CAN`T TRADE PHISICAL GOLD ONLINE. You can`t make immediate purchases/ buy services with gold on internet.

@_date: 2019-12-31 12:38:56
Some points are in opposition to each other. In case the price reach 50K, transaction fees would not increase - no sense for that since the mining costs will be somewhere between 6-12K depending on difficulty. Moreover it's your decision - I never use more than 3-4 sat/bit and got confirmation within an hour. BUT if the fees REALLY increase the dominance wouldn't be 80% as it will take the newcomers to alternatives like it happened before. So IMO your predictions could not happen altogether.

All of them and unfortunatelly many of us here are still living into the old paradigm and are trying to understand bitcoin into the lights of it. In fact BTC is NOT an investment, it is NOT an alternative of gold or "digital gold" or store of value or whatever similar old-thinking-way You want.
BTC is NOT something You must want to ~~cash-out~~ fiat-out with profits.
BTC is THE FUTURE and it is here not to drive fiat profits but to REPLACE fiat and the fiat system. IN ALL. 
I would recommend to **not carry about these people** or other people. BTC is inevitable as fiat replacement by nature. Would You carry in 1970 You can not convince some people they need a personal computer? But from the time first compact computers have been done, they were inevitable as mass adobtion by nature. Same here, forget the people, it is not important to convince anyone, nor the government, nor an institution, the leading technology, inventions which drive the progress are inevitable by nature and BTC is such a new paradigm.
Take care.

OK, if You operate as a company, Your company wallets must be public and all transactions must go through these official wallets if that`s the question. It`s not much different than fiat-based bank accounts. I`m not sure what do You mean BTC is private, but there are very simple solutions for all such "problems".
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:59:33
yES, IT IS ok to send them an amount You like to use for buying crypto. It is BETTER as if You wait first to confirm the first thin deposit it can take 6-10 business days (and You know we are already in holidays) so Your first BTC will come after pretty long time. The £2 is MINIMAL, not mandatory! Just note that NOT every european bank will approve a transfer to coinbase! I hope You will have success with Your bank; if not You will need even more time to open an account in other bank. I personaly have two rejections from european banks when I tried sepa transfer to coinbase, because coinbase is crypto involved :)

NO. Why shold be use of decentralized, LIMITED currency connected by some way with the ..anarchy? We will pay taxes but with BTC; both things are completely different and could not be connected in any way between. Actualy the government will become as well MORE INDEPENDANT from the big capital players with BTC.
