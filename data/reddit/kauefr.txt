I'm confused about the refilling part:
What's that node you're sending your funds to, and how can you trust them to route those funds to you so your channel gets rebalanced?

So the time window to publish this penalty tx is between the moment they broadcast the cheating tx and the moment it gets included in a block? Sorry to bother but I'm having a hard time getting the defense measures of LN.

Any concern, valid or not, is labeled as "FUD" and "BCash shilling".

Great post OP, lot of useful info.


What happens if A's tx is not confirmed fast enough? Such as if the mempool if full or if the cheater's tx pays a large fee? Does A (or the watcher) needs to "race" B's tx on the blockchain?

1. What happens if I see the cheating transaction only after it's included in a block?
2. What happens when both me and the cheater broadcast our txs at the same time but the cheater's tx has a larger fee? Will it get confirmed first? Will this cancel my correct tx?

If reading Satoshi's paper makes you think of BCH, what does that mean?

You're right, I'm sorry. But I think these pets are a great scalability experiment.

Or just use a better coin.
