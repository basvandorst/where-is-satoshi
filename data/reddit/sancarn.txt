It didn't sound to me as if it was a misunderstanding

He doesn't deny it actually...


He never said that at all.


Also not true...
However on everything else we agree :) Jordan is not a perfect human, agreed, but no one is.
As another said

Doesn't sound like a climate change denier to me. Just seems to me as if he's skeptical of man made climate change and being skeptical is what I'd expect from a researcher.
Generally speaking manmade global warming is a difficult concept to grasp unless you have prior knowledge in chemistry and physics. I don't expect this is the kind of knowledge Peterson has, which is why he'll likely never be convinced on the issue.
If you're looking at Peterson for knowledge regarding a purely physical phenomena then your barking up the wrong tree. It's no surprise to me that, as a psychologist, he focuses on the human perceptions/politics of climate change more than the physics.

The first I'd ostracise are those calling for ostracization. E.G. Hitler, and, well, you apparently.

Mhmm interesting. Looks like these tweets were from 2014. He has since done interviews where he seems more convinced about a warming climate 


As for C-16 I did spend an hour watching  It didn't sound to me as if it was just a misunderstanding to me. But that is just my opinion of course.

You might want to watch the full uncut interview before you go using that link in a debate...
