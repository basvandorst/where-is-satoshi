@_date: 2014-07-24 22:30:02
Its really no problem. I love digital currency so being active is just like breathing lol
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:17:49
I don't see what you are saying. Be a little less sarcastic pls k thnx
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:11:40
That's pretty cool, but I need something that does a monthly subscription for at least 6 months duration. I could not see that this payment gateway can do this. Perhaps I overlooked something?

Thank you for the kind words, Ned. I love digital currency and how its changing the world because of all the problems it solves. I am really looking forward to what the future has in store for bitcoin. Did you read about the bitcoin foundation trying to get lobbyists together? Pretty neat how everything is slowly coming to fruition all by itself with the help of a little community. Its great

@_date: 2014-05-28 21:57:29
Wow, guys!! Thank you so much for showing him support, I had no idea this would rally the people. This is so inspiring. I will Let him know to cross post and stuff like that so he gets more attention

Though this is probably true, if we can get a conglomerate of perspectives I think we can get her to produce a better article
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:42:22
Very informative, thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-11 17:37:49
If I were him I would have deleted my youtube account by now. He looks like his name should be billy badass. I bet he's drunk in that video too. I bet his stairmaster has an ashtray. What a piece of trash
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:12:47
That awesome. We need more people like you in the world to perpetuate bitcoins growth. All merchants should be accepting bitcoin. This is the way we get that to happen. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:02:10
Was this supposed to make me lol? It did.
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:08:15
How come this isnt getting any recognition? Its a cool story!! Its my story!!
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:40:13
Thank you for taking the time to read my article everyone. Im working on another one about the debate behind governments making cryptocurrency illegal, it should be pretty interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:33:56

@_date: 2013-11-08 14:49:43

@_date: 2013-11-08 23:48:39
The Feds are going to be really really wealthy lol

I am working on a tutorial about cold storing your wallet will post it soon
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:27:23
Yes, the block follows a sequence which is exactly why the next block can be mined
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:57:04
Please explain more..
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:48:37
Lol malhark! You're awesome :)
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:41:39
Its crazy what just happened.. BTCe decides to relist ftc now and the price corrected. I just doubled my money almost in 1 hour
@_date: 2013-11-04 06:01:25
"Mining a block is difficult because the SHA-256 hash of a block's header must be lower than or equal to the target in order for the block to be accepted by the network. This "problem can be simplified for explanation purposes: The hash of a block must start with a certain number of zeros. The probability of calculating a hash that starts with many zeros is very low, therefore many attempts must be made. In order to generate a new hash each round, a nonce is incremented. See Proof of work for more information. "
this is basically what I was saying..

Wow, that is awful, man. Im sorry to hear about that. If you watch Ricky from Trailer Park Boys.. "Just remember Lahey, what comes around is all around!" Hopefully those scumbags get whats coming to them. Again, sorry to hear that.
