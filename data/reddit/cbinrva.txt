Guesstimating 30lbs total in a 24x24x12 box  three day priority shipping should be about $32 - $40 and today priority shipping should be  between $85 &amp; $140.  Though I may end up selling my AntMiner C1 and or S3+ as well if you'd be interested in those as well or instead.

What is the zip code?

The mods must have deleted it, I didn't that's for sure. All included I figure $100 + shipping - about 25ea for the S1s, 20 for the PSU, and 5 for the WiFi antennas.

They probably don't, but I don't pay for utilities at my place, so it isn't a big deal :)

How you might go about accepting BTC online for your web store depends largely on whether you intend to keep the currency digital or if you want it converted into Fiat. Feel free to PM me and I will see if I can help you find solution that best meet your needs
