Yea for sure - always hard to predict the peak of course.  I am down a good bit from my 5300 btc buy in, but still up overall, at least.  
I want LTC to come back up in the green so i can xfer it to btc :p

Id like to understand this as well, and how/why the alts are getting clobbered, while BTC is staying fairly steady.

I'm assuming it just means buying low and selling high...Instead of the HODL mentality of only buying low.

Don't you know?  The more you steal, the less time you do.  If you steal enough, you don't even go to prison!

I'm surprised you don't have 10 downvotes by now.  For some reason people in this sub fucking HATE the idea of "trading" BTC.  But I do the same thing - Hold in general, and buy in the dips when I can.

Yep, I got screwed by Coinbase, too.  I put in my request in like November and I still haven't received a response.
Granted, it's been a few weeks and Gemini hasn't verified my identity yet, so I'm just stuck unless I trade something for BTC

So what you're saying is...you have a learning disorder? xD
Seriously though...be smart this time around and hold.  You can buy more, but do.not.sell. until the price is over 19k.

Uhh...Welcome to the fiat/monetary system?  Money is literally debt.  It's created out of debt.  Debt is combated with more debt, essentially.

Yes.  Any information is helpful.  I dunno why I was dumb enough to ask on Reddit, though.  To google!
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:56:22
Thanks, will do.  Testing with small amounts is a good plan.

Couldn't agree more.

If you actually have 1200 BTC....Getting an attorney would be a drop in the bucket.  Get an attorney.

What is the safest way to trade BTC?  Currently using Coinbase.  What's the best way with a Trezor?

There, is that better?
