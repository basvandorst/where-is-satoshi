Thing is, most of the speakers weren't canadian.
Jeffrey Tucker was from the US I believe and was talking some pretty hardcore libertarian stuff, to the point that I didn't feel comfortable being photographed or seen sitting in that room.
Cody Wilson is from texas and was advocating dark markets.
Manie Eagar is south african, and was a great speaker.
Vitalik Buterin is russian, and was likewise a genius and great speaker to listen to.

Yes, I came to learn about technology. Not to gripe about our government.

I sat in them from 8:45am until 6pm two days in a row, regularly getting up to walk and stretch my legs, and I must disagree!

Then why do they not label them as such?

I already paid, I have no choice. I'm getting my money's worth, but I probably won't come next year.

You good sir, are a douchebag.

I would have had no problem attending a libertarian/crypto-currency conference. I just wish they labelled it as such is all.

The chairs were incredibly uncomfortable.
This is coming from a person who spends all day in a chair..!

Do you care to elaborate? I am easily swooned by big words I suppose.

It bothered me that the chairman of a bitcoin foundation took membership fees from bitcoiners and then almosted usurped the entire conference to promote ethereum which he is obviously heavily invested in.

Please, tell me more! Was there considerably more tech talks than political ones?
I love me a reason to fly to Vegas!

Well shucks, I would hate to have you at my bedside the next time I got sick.
me: "cough, cough..."

Wow, so you're a libertarian extremist AND an asshole?
I'll certainly avoid you and your ilk, rest assured.

I only emphasized BITCOIN because the founders seemed to be promoting Ethereum, and not Bitcoin.
