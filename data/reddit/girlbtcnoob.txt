Nice! You must be feeling much better now for holding! It can be quite scary!

Thanks! I feel so stupid though for not buying 3 when I had the chance. Now it's SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE! I honestly don't know what to do :(

I just did this last week. Bought on the 30th of October. Hit my bank Nov 3rd/4th and got my bitcoin on the 5th.

Sorry I'm stupid. I don't understand this logic. Why do you think this?

Haha. It's like a mental block I guess. Okay I have a noob question. I'm using coinbase and it made an address for me with where my BTC is. But is there a way that I can tell just by the address how much BTC is in it? I feel like I'm blindly trusting there is BTC in it because the site tells me so. Is there anything else I can do?

alright. Thank you very much! I'll try this out

What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:16:17
What is soon? And what factors do you attribute to an increase of that magnitude?
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:13:00
alright i'll make a new thread about it
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:07:02
Bleh. I just looked it up and it says 0. What do i do now. ._.

That has nothing to do with why the Bitstamp price closed in on the MtGox price. There is currently a sell wall in place on MtGox @ 269.9 for 1.5million USD$ keeping the price below 270. Or something like that. It's been like this for a couple of hours now.

I'm guessing now would be a horrible time to buy?? GARSH WHY DOES COINBASE HAVE A 7 DAY WAIT BEFORE I CAN BUY AGAIN!!
