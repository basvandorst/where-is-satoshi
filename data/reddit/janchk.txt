If Binance and Bitfinex don't deploy it, we are never going above 10%.

Tnx! When Mainnet?!?

Reminder to devs/exchanges : Change denomination to bits(uBTC) already for fucks sake!
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:08:15
Core is not a company. It is a diverse group of developers that improve Bitcoin for free. If you want Bitcoin to improve, you need to help. Run a node, try lightning Network, report some bugs, give developers feedback. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:25:41
Coinbase won't run anything at all. This cesspool of corruption and incompetence will die off soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:15:04
Its not the first nor the last. Bitcoin has had 6 or 7 bubble phases already, I am sure there will be more. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:54:24
Get out with that shit token. Nobody needs [that]( 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:18:36
Why must the supply increase? Makes no sense to me, satoshi is 10E-8 of BTC and on LN you can use miliSatoshis already...
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:02:11
Great work man!
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:05:11
It's much easier to just use bcash for BCH. Causes 0% confusion, even by BCH supporters.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:46:13
Eclair has an exe. But you need a bitcoin node.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:50:38
No noob can send any satoshis over mainnet or even testnet. This thing is fucking hard although amazing. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:19:42
This is absolutely necessary! Where can I sign? It is something that everyone agrees on, but it is still not changed!
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:50:32
Never bought anything. I just find this platform useless. A website that offers bounties in btc, eth, xmr works just the same. And it offers a real reward not some steaks ;)

@_date: 2017-12-21 23:10:59
At current mempoll size it does not deserve to rise in price and it will apparently get worse. Should fall down to Vegeta support line. I will be patient with this dip. It might last a few months...Segwit adoption must vastly increase and lighting network must go live..
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:46:41
Which Client is this, where can I download it?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:03:12
But bcash needs pentabyte block to achieve the same. This is just extremely inefficient and infrastructure expensive paypal then and makes absolute no sense. And if you involve IOT, then LN is maybe also not enough. But we can use IOTA for that. Some crypto can coexist very well. But bcash it is just a short term pump and miners ambition to have full control and by that become centralised.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:20
Adoption only at 8%, stagnating for two months...sad times...
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:29:46
Doing the same thing. My node is at 40%. Going to use Eclair. It is amazing to be able to help your investment from your living room.  And as a bonus you can help with the demise of Roger Ver and Bcash. Social media smearing is not sufficient.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:53:16
Patience young padawan. Lightning network is coming. Fees will be less then a cent again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:41:42
LN needs 133MB blocks to do all transactions in the world for 7 Billion people. Bcash and onchain scaling needs Pentabyte blocks to achieve the same, isn´t that ridiculous?!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:08
When I close the Eclair app and reopen it, my channel is in state CLOSING forever. How to I get the channel back up?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:16:27
Roger Ver on suicide watch! Very good news!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:17:57
Ofcourse no node in China...
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:55:15
Maybe you should check that Lightning network thing. It will change your mind.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:03:50
Yes, let the hate flow through you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:57:23
I definitely want to open a channel with her ;)

@_date: 2017-12-30 11:27:23
When are they going to be implemented?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:20:03
Bitstamp, Electrum, Coinomi, Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:07:54
1 million unconfirmed transactions incoming...yay!
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:43:42
Roger Ver on suicide watch!  Fantastic news!
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:21:20
Ask him when is he planning to FUD for the next dip?!
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:12:45
That is what a decentralized system needs. Everyone helping and pulling the weight!
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:46:33
Dont forget to test the Lightning network, while you are at it. Eclair works with windows, it is really user friendly.Anybody can try!
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:06:59
This is FUD.  Bitcoin is going up! I am especially confident, because everyone talks about the short. This 
makes me certain that the opposite will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:58:24
Current high fees are making bitcoin very expensive for dollar cost averaging. But Bitstamp is covering outgoing transactions fees...  I am not sure how long will this last. We cannot give fuel to the likes of Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:45
How about almost 200k unconfirmed transactions...  
And why is the hash rate falling from 15Exa to 11Exa today?  
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:45:23
If you run eclair implementation, yes. I think c-lightning implementation requires full node too. Lnd works without full node, but its only linux and pretty complex to set up. 
Eclair also has a android app. So you can make some basic tests without the node. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:26
Current state is shit!  Look newbs: [unconfirmed transactions]( and [fees](  
Price is nice but it won't last in the current state of Bitcoin.
That is why we need Lightning Network:    Anyone can help. We are helping our own Investment anyway!  Is it possible to help a company's stock if you are not employed there? Can you raise the price of gold by yourself somehow?  You can definitely help the price of Bitcoin from your living room!
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:46:16
Can one already run a node? Are there any instructions for runing a lightning node?   Also, can I make any money running a node?
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:36:41
Bulls are shilling hard but Kobayashi has moved the coins and Buffet and friends are shorting :P ... Tough battle of the bears and bulls.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:34:32
What absolute horse shit are you saying...node runs on raspberry pi which consumes 5W, this is 120W per day maximum! That is less then 10 cents per day anywhere in the world.  Are you absolutely and utterly retarded?!?
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:03:29
Copies are called original visions in crypto world ;)
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:35:31
Not to mention that LN provides incentive to run a full node.
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:08:16
Thats denial...
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:07:25
We are still in denial!
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:11:03
You are in denial. You are basicaly saying what is says on the chart:
'My Investments are with good companies, they will come back'. 
It's when you give up hope, then it is done.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:36:15
Let them pump to 10.000$ for all I care. They will learn what  centralized means the hard way...
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:02:02
Nice one! I must agree with You  
btw: "I am trying to change the entire world for the better" [(Roger Ver, The miss of Bcash :D)](  
This guy will implode from self love very soon. Jihan though, is another more dangerous beast...
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:47:42
This is exactly the feel I get about bcash folks, when I read some posts over at r/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:05:46
Also be wary which wallet you choose. 
Exodus looked the nicest and easy too me, but they charge horrendous amount in fees. Paid 16$ for 1 transaction and they supposedly have segwit on it. And average fee on EXODUS is around 3 to 4$ 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:02:17
Don´t forget Faketoshi and McAfee. So many egomaniacs at one place. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:49
You got money for your free airdropped Btrash. How is that being fucked? You only got poorer if you traded with jihan in his PnD. Now thats on you! 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:11:00

S2X was a planned attack. The actors of the attack saw that it will not work. That is why they changed the attack plan and are using BCH now for the attack. All supporters are rich individuals and can definitely move the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:27:07
That's what I meant with hard assets...just don't sell bitcoin for dollar and hold dollars or central banks inflated stocks and bonds.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:43:02
Thank you for making this sticky. This talk eliminated all doubts I had about off-chain scaling. Sold BCash the same day. Amazing talk!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:48:57
Implementing a lot of stuff at the same time and at a fast pace does not mean it will work well. It's gonna be buggy and hacky, I would say. Security is extremely important when it comes to money and here Bitcoin still rules.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:08:28
Whenever Jihan tweets, BCH pumps. Funny how this cult coin works. Just look at their egomaniac team of Roger Ver, Faketoshi and Mcaffe...:/
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:21:14
Probably for the monument but for the round about the county had to contribute...those things cost millions... especially if a friend of a mayor is involved;)

Why would you ever sell? Give the money back to Jamie Dimon and the likes?
Buy house to live in, a fast car, new shoes, education...Put what's left on a ledger for retirement and forget about the dollar or euro. Future is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:52:23
One can immediately see that this is fake. The writing style is totally propagandist and written in simple emotional language. 
It also perfectly aligns with Blockstream views. I would assume that a person like Satoshi has more of an unique opinion on the matter.
I am against forks but this is just bullshit E-Mail.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 11:47:59
Huge bubble has bursted. Reading r/bitcoin makes me think we are still in the denial phase of the bubble..could go down to 3k. I don't think new money is coming in right now
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:52:38
You should definitely buy hard assets with Bitcoin, but to buy dollar with Bitcoin seems extremely stupid to me.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:27:47
Why would you ever sell? Why do you think Bitcoin is done 2020? 
We go back to USD then? Banks will be good again in 2020 or what?
Sell only for hard assets like lambo and land on moon! That is my plan.
