Hi, yeah people can think of it like Just-Dice. I am trying to make the interface a little friendlier for to use with casino games. 
Funny thing is I actually had this idea years ago, before Just-Dice was live, but decided to work on the poker section of the site first and so Just-Dice beat me to executing the concept.

Hi r/Bitcoin.
My name is Dean Nolan, CEO/developer of  
I have just added feature that allows you to invest in house casino games or open your own tables. 
Investing in the house tables increases the maximum bet that players can make while giving you a share of the profit.
Opening your own table gives you more control. You can set the maximum bet players can make and soon there will be tools to create custom promotions to attract players to your table.
Investments are instant and can be withdrawn at any time. No minimum investment for house games. Profit split 90% to investors and 10% house.
Would be great to get your opinion on what tools/features you would like to see as an investor.
*more casino games being worked on now and should be live over the next week or two
Feel free to ask me anything.

May isn't actually employed by me. PRC is run by 1 person, me. He is a member of the community and helps people out a lot. However it was the PRC community that caught these guys. 
But yes there are no obvious flaws with PRC. It is now the longest running Dice site that people can invest in and the most trusted. PRC was open before Just-Dice

Yes I knew it was dooglus but others might not know who that is. He posted it in the PRC thread yesterday.
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:46:12
Someone used the same method to spoof 4k BTC moving from our crowdfunded cold storage address too which caused a few people to be concerned.
Glad Blockchain.info fixed it now. Good thing there is alternative block explorers that did not have this issue.

It is very hard to get people to change to something else even if there are benefits. Players play were there's traffic and large marketing budgets are needed to make that happen.
Don't know if you frequent 2+2 but a few years ago there were many threads about the state of the poker ecology and how bad games were online. There were many ideas given as to how sites could improve.
This is the reason I made Pocket Rockets Casino. I implemented a lot of the ideas. Also since it was becoming popular I was the first to offer online Open Face Chinese.
Despite all the benefits it never got much traffic and no support from the community. Didn't help that is was Bitcoin only.
Unibet implemented a few of the ideas a year later and are seen as the first to have done them due to marketing.
However, PRC is more popular now and we'll be bringing poker back by the end of the year. I've always wanted to do a mental poker implementation but there's still a lot of work to do in the field. I would like to add that in the future for sure.

The new forum looks really good. 
Interested to see if any users will migrate from Bitcointalk or not.
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:10:58
I removed the faucet as it was abused by people who created many accounts who would claim the faucet all day and just withdraw instead of actually trying the site.
We are re-branding and launching a new updated version very soon and I will allow some free plays for new accounts to try the games.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:14:33
That's a very odd conclusion you jumped to. Why would I be trying to promote an alt-coin when I run a Bitcoin only casino?
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:44:23
I tried using the forum as soon as it was launched.
I made a post and got some trolls (from Bitcointalk) posting FUD. 
I reported to the mods.
They decided to delete my thread, my pm's that I sent them and never actually replied to me or sent me a message.
Since there was no traffic anyway I never bothered to follow up but I would be hesitant to use the forum there again.
It's a shame as it had the potential to be good

The hot wallet at  can run out of funds many times in a day depending on traffic.
I just keep frequently topping it up. This happens on quite a few Bitcoin sites as you don't want to keep too many coins in an online wallet.
I wouldn't worry about it just yet and give the admin time to refill.

We use Armory to store players and investor funds.
One of the main reasons for choosing Armory over 2 years ago was the watching only wallet feature.
Being able to generate and monitor 10,000+ cold storage addresses, create a transaction online and sign it offline were vital security features needed.
Is there any current wallet software that works in the same way?   
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:45:13
We run a provably fair daily lottery at 
Currently the daily jackpot is 10 Bitcoin and ticket price starts at 0.001 for 6 numbers. You can choose up to 9 numbers.
The site has a crowdfunded bankroll for the dice game but I have not enabled this for lottery/casino games yet. I wanted to wait and see what the interest was first.
When I do enable this then the jackpot will increase a lot.
There's currently free Bitcoin being given away in the chat every few minutes so if you come hang out you will be able to try it for free.

If you are going to have a relatively large amount of coins in a wallet Armory is one of the best options around.
The cold wallet and offline transaction signing are excellent security features. 
It may look like a power user tool but it really doesn't take a long time to learn and if dealing with larger amounts of money it's well worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:27:04
Thanks. Glad you like it.

OK I'll look at getting this fixed. Are you on PC or mobile? What browser?
When you say input in general do you mean clicking a bet button doesn't register or you have to click twice?

Also was this clicking join table or add chips button?

Dragging lobby around is on the list. 
I had balance shown in lobby before but a lot of players, primarily poker players, didn't like it. Could maybe show total on Black Jack tables themselves though.

In that hand it was because dealer got Black Jack, 2 cards adding up to 21 automatically wins, unless you have Black Jack also. You would win. It is to stop you doubling or splitting when you can't win.

Seals With Clubs currently use software provided by Briggs Softworks. So they may not be able to add new features or fix bugs as easily as a company that writes their own software. 
Pocket Rockets also doesn't require Flash or other plugins.
There are features built into our software to improve the experience for all players too, see  for some details. We will be adding more games and features soon.
@_date: 2013-04-13 12:31:01
Tournaments and S&amp;G's should be available within the next 1-2 months.
The reason that it will be this time is I want to do more research into how to make the games better and I am discussing with users what their existing problems with these formats. 
This is the same as I done with the ring games and why I implemented some of the features that are listed in the blog.
I could just add tournaments now but it would just be a clone of what existing sites have and not really solving any problems.

Yes, sent you chips. Thanks

Due to the great feedback from r/Bitcoin last time I've decided to run another promo this weekend.
Anyone who registers a new account by clicking the link above will get a depositors bonus.
Deposit as little as 0.05BTC and get 500 chips free.
Pocket Rockets Casino has no limit Hold'em and pot limit Omaha cash games with promotions
for bad beat jack pot, beating a site pro and more.
Tournaments will be coming soon as well as other poker and casino games.
Feel free to ask any questions.
The bonus chips will be added to a players account within 30 minutes of depositing but will not be eligible to withdraw until the player has earned 1000 Action Points, all other winnings can be withdrawn instantly.
See  for more details on Action Points.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:27:08
Thanks. The main thing needed just now is traffic so share with other poker/bitcoin enthusiasts and we could organise a game.

1) There are DDOS prevention methods used on the server that will stop most of these style of attacks.
The site will also be moved onto Microsoft's Azure cloud service to help with scaling and have fallback servers start instantly.
2) Player funds are completely segregated and stored in offline wallets that are on encrypted HDD and never connect to the internet.
All withdrawals are signed offline using the Armory wallet software  
3) The software is custom built. This allows me to fix any issues that may appear as fast as possible and also add new features and games. 
The software will be getting an independent audit in future from a reputable company.
4) There are collusion methods in place and ways to detect bots. Any accounts found to be cheating or are bots will be banned and funds seized. 
5) Currently there is only one employee, me. Even in future with employees there will be strict methods to prevent them from having access to anything that could give an advantage. Even now I have absolutely no way to view other players cards while playing a hand. No one else has any access at all to player funds.
Your questions were great and what people need to have answers to and thanks for the games. 
I want to be as open and honest at all times about the software so that players can feel as secure as possible to play at the site.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:23:54


Credited chips to your account. Good Luck

Turns out some one or a group created multiple accounts and tried to dump all the bonus chips into one account then withdraw.
This was spotted promptly before cashout and the offending accounts were closed, banned and funds seized. Any players who may have played against one of these accounts will be refunded even if they were given free chips.
I would like to point out that this is something that could happen at any poker site. What was good to see is how fast we were able to detect it in the early stages of being live.
Further investigation will be done to all accounts created today to see if any more were part of this scam attempt.
We would like to assure you that all player funds are safe still.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:13:10


Sent you chips to try it out, thanks.

Hi r/Bitcoin, I had some great feedback here when I posted a few months back but now there's more traffic so you should find games running more often.
Pocket Rockets Casino lets you play Open Face Chinese (OFC) poker for Bitcoin.
OFC is one of the fastest growing poker games in Vegas.  
You can play on PC, phone, tablet or mac using your browser.
Deposit now to get 100% deposit bonus up to 5BTC. 
You can also play regular Texas Hold'em and pot limit Omaha.
Please feel free to ask any questions or concerns and I will clear them up.
