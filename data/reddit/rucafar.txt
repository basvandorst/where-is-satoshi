at the moment i am trying to buy some bitcoins so i can buy stuff on the internet cause the international debit cards visa in the local banks they only allow you to recharge if someone is studying or went for medical treatment abroad, no shopping only its allowed, with bitcoins i can buy miners and the ATM machine, one thing here that's cheap is electricity. lol

yes that's it! you summed all up, that's why i told you that i should check if the government let me, cause for them anything new is a threat on their leadership, they don't take lightly, i study abroad and traveled to many countries and i see how this government is they just don't care about our people.
How society is 3% super rich, 5% middle class i suppose and 92% really poor, like no tap water, electricity and they live below 1 dollar per day its insane, how can you grow a country like that?

yes I think so too, you don't even now how much it cost to live here

I'll have to see in legal terms if the government allows me to install a bitcoin company ATM mining cloud, i don´t really know how it works, i'll contact some people to see if its possible, this is a world of opportunities no middle man "banks" I'll check it out

Thanks for the tip I will try contact some people in expat communities.

not really, and you can't send money internationally to much policies in local banks, so bitcoins are the best and the easiest way to go.
But is not worth it in my opinion...
