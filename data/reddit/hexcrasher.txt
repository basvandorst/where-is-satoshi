I did the same thing a few days ago. Try putting the second transaction through the viabtc tx accelerator.

I'm pretty sure he is into it on an ideological level and will probably use all that money he's made to keep it going, purely to cause chaos for the establishment.

This should give you a rough idea.

I've been thinking about this a little bit too. What if, instead of trying to crush bitcoin, they say that bitcoin is great. The only catch is, they say that the only entities that can legally run an exchange are a government agency ie: the Federal Reserve (or local equivalent). Time passes, everyone is used to governments running the exchanges, everything is working out nice for everyone.
 Then the government's say that the only addresses that you can use legally to make any transactions have to be applied for from the exchange, like a driver's license or social security number. Since the government runs the exchanges, they can likely set the price at whatever they want. They can also now track every transaction everywhere. 
I've probably been reading too much science fiction, but seeing as how no one really knows who this Satoshi fellow is, I sometimes think that bitcoin might have been designed with just this end in mind.
I'm probably missing something important here that makes this impossible, please point it out to me.

The PERCIEVED ideology. No one knows what the actual motivation for creating bitcoin was.

Dread Pirate Roberts believes in Silk Road so much that I dont think it will ever die while he is free/alive.
