It is way easier to walk to your local bank.then walk 300 miles

If you want to pay cash over the counter you can not unless you have a account at the branch , which destroy making annoymos deposits to buy crypto

Hi mate you should do something like this 
He has made £28k in 4 months

Nope I have had bitcoin for the past 4 years. Bitcoin won't be killed but leveled out
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:37:04
But wouldn't this be because to buy alt coins at the moment the main way is to buy bitcoin or ether first 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:24:44
true , but as the bitcoin hype dies i think it may start to level out at a reasonable rate for the everyday person , Not that i don't love when its very high though. Bitcoin Its just "play" crypto for me now as made my profit on it

Lol for sure I say about 10 at the moment maybe 15-20 by the end of the year with upcoming ICO's
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:42:01
95% of people are here to see profit on there investment which will be in Fiat. I do not here of many people investing not to see a return
Bitcoin is just a digital asset 
Some other coins are actual projects with plans to hopefully change things in the future
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:55:30
Yep there is not one for bitcoin. This is people buying into something that does not exist But holds value 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:47:57
Yep a strong company backing with a project that will actually change the way we do things 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:28:43

Very true , i have had bitcoin for a few years now , but also have a few alt coins with companies that have amazing projects coming along
But it does make me think bitcoin has no company backing and it can still be used with everything it already does even if the value does drop. The value of bitcoin only really matters to the people who hold it. It will never disappear but value may drop. The community is strong and it is the first crypto so price will stay high but once the community loses faith it drops. But this does not change what it does
If that makes sense lol
