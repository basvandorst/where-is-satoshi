That is a good point. Especially in light of news coming out of china on this issue over the past year (ie, local-level chinese authorities are openly trying to game the BTC market)

Except that expectations of deflation are the most certain way to get investors to leave a given marketplace. And, one MIGHT need investment in order to bolster employment and firm growth. Just sayin.

Dude.... that didn't even make any sense. Do you even know what fiduciary law is? 
How is your that one fact that you're riding even relevant to fiduciary standards exactly?

-  In the US, 60% of market capitalization is in fiduciary hands. In many European countries it's higher. 
- In most countries, fiduciary law requires investment strictly in the interests of the client. In many countries (US &amp; Japan included), jurisprudence takes this to mean that a fiduciary party investing heavily in a market *where reasonable certainty of a widespread decline in values exists*, would be a breach of fiduciary values (a breach of contract entitling the client to damages, and possibly endangering one's fiduciary license basically).  
So, you may feel *personally* one way or the other about the neutrality of price levels, and might invest accordingly, but the institutional investors and mutual funds that comprise the largest slice of the financial markets in the US and Europe would basically have the contractual obligation to such expectation as a sell signal. You see this in practice in Japan, which is known for the exportation of its savings onto foreign financial markets ( such as Korea, Taiwan, India, HK).

I actually think that this is a positive thing for Bitcoin. Whereas some states might try to ban bitcoin (Belgium for example), canada has just recognized officially, that bitcoin is indeed a legitimate thing.

Meh... Thats what they said 10 years ago. And it actually seemed more palpable back then. 
There's lots of reddit threads dating to that time still swirling around reddit.
