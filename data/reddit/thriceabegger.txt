Dude...look into the transaction fee's and times... It's not a currency man. It's Tulips in amsterdam. I'd google that as well. This shit is NEVER going back to 19k a bitcoin.

I don't think the high prices involved in exchanges is going to be solved. Nor the lengthy time it takes in exchanges. There are serious problems with the platform itself at this point. 
That's why you are now seeing so many clones quick to jump on the bandwagon and actually getting attention this time around. Blood is in the water.
I'd exit if I were you. I'd exit quick. Otherwise your going to be holding onto some really beautiful tulips.
Bitcoin WAS the greatest investment oppurtunity of the modern age. Nothing compares. It made buying apple stock look like a bond purchase. It couldn't handle the weight. I don't think anything handles that weight for long.
Not to mention...you are gunna go up against the U.S. Dollar? And thought you would be ALLOWED to actually win? ask Hussein how that went.

It doesn't cost me 20+ dollars every trade I make in the Dollar, Euro, Peso...

It's at 11k... and its probably going to drop again fairly soon. The market is incredibly volatile right now. That's were peaks are usually found. Lows are usually found after the volatility and happen on an idle tuesday afternoon.
The transaction fees basically make this "currency" worthless. Were will the bottom be? I dont know. But it will be lower than 7k.
