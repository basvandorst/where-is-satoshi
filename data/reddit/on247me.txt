I went to my local grocery store , they didnt accept bitcoin as payment , i didnt purchase any groceries ...

Sadly , it appears its more hard to say and prove "Hey , i didnt purchase that  bitcoin" (using my acccount  and info ) that "Hey someone took / skimmed my card and got gas / electronics / whatever"

Maybe , improving security is something people in charge of btc services have to work on , also 90% + percent of the time btc isnt the failure point but the server /net / physical security   


You really discredit your argument by being ofensive , we all here to improve tech , but have lives outside ...  


Wrong coin

Oh , they have a nice feature where you can just create volumes and attach them to machines at 0.04 / GB / mo

I recomend lunanode at 5.18 mo , its KVM so you actually get all the resources mentioned , 1 gig ram + 1TB bandwidth , 30 G storage .

Yes , its a conspiracy , we are not running out of capacity at all !

Something Something morals .

We will have a plenty of capacity , for a while , bitcoins TXs per sec will only continue to rise , at least if people still intend this to be a seriously payment alternative ( some people dont , and view it as an alterantive for only some use cases , another discussion)
Theres a inerhent limit to how many TXs are able to fit in a block  , just like transistors in processors arent gona be able to get any more smaller due to physics
Segwit is a great feature and clever solution but is only a temporary fix ,  im 100% certain the blocks will be filled again in sooner or later and will we have a backlog like the current one
Im stunned that bitcoin is halting its hability to scale up on purpose
