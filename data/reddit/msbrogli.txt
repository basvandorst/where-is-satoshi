In this scenario, Mallory would be Alice's mail transfer agent, right?
Otherwise, Bob would know that the message was intercepted.

Didn't know that. Looks like the same :)

I'm not sure what you mean by DRM.
It can be used in many different ways. The immediate application is for exchange password or secret messages. You send to your friend's e-mail and he can read it one time. If anyone got access to your friend's e-mail after he read the message, the invader can't see the password or secret message.
If someone intercept your message id, this man-in-the-middle could have access to the encrypted message but can't read its content. To totally prevent this man-in-the-middle attack we must enable HTTPS.

"Gern was here..." (very good!)

Of course the recipient can always make a copy. He has access to the content of the message and can do whatever he wants with that. It's his responsability to keep the content safe. Another premise is that the recipient is reliable.

We will fix mobile access. Thanks :)

I agree that the data could be copied - in this sense, you have to trust the host. As  said, you can host it at your own server and create your own policy.
Anyway, the message is encrypted and it's impossible to access its content. The host just has access to a bundle of non-sense bytes. :) You can read more about AES 256-bit encryption here:

The first risk is inherent to the design. It is designed to be simple and the passphrase is randomly generated. The premise is: anyone who has the link has access to the content. We are discussing about adding a second passphrase to allow the download of the message. Then, you can send the link and the second passphrase using different channels.
The second risk is about trusting the host. If you don't trust, you can just host into your server.

Yes, it is a premise that you must trust the recipient. You cannot control what they will do after getting the content of the message. They can publish it anywhere or just keep it safe.
