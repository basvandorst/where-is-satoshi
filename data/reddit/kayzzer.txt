It's *likely* that the thief works at CF?

How are you sure you've never been breached?

This would be easy to defeat. I'd release a wallet that acted normally for X months, then swept everything to myself.

Or... don't install any Bitcoin wallets from the App Store? That seems easier to me.

You’re missing that the block reward keeps halving (so it doesn’t just go to 0, at least for awhile), and as the reward goes down, the fees get more and more valuable. When block reward is gone, miners will mine for fees.

You could make the argument, but you’d sound dumb and wrong.

No, their fear is that you borrowed that money from someone and therefore have another creditor you owe money too.

No, that's not the preferred procedure. The Right Way is to send the password over https via POST, so it doesn't show in your History. Hashing happens server-side.

No, that's not the way most sites do it. Source: 15 years in the industry.

Some people mine empty blocks.

What do you call a boss with no workers?
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:19:31
Or they could just restore a new one with the seed and give you that. I doubt most people would notice. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:07:35
Yes but the block reward still dwarfs the fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:15:43
Not sure you know what "brute force" means...

As long as they don't let customers have it, they're keeping it. It doesn't matter if they don't do anything with it or not.

I failed what? i’m neutral, i hodl both. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:50:36
it’s already over $9k when you add in the bch true hodlers have

Or, core could have raised to 2MB. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:56:47
what other words have you redefined?
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:57:46
By the time it happens, the block reward will already be close to 0.

If apple's security is half-assed, who is full-assed?
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:04:06
Not every altcoin, only ones worth something like the person you're responding to said. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:47:41
I agree with you. What coinbase is actually doing ("wait and see") is more logical than what they say they're doing ("nevar BCC").

"The probability that a mistyped address is accepted as being valid ... is approximately 1 in 4.29 billion."
This idea is not needed.

Everyone should have their iOS backups encrypted anyway. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:45:38
Dude, that was like, 73 questions. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:33:30
Exchanges don't typically keep each user's balance on separate addresses. That would be more like a wallet service. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:25:30
"Cyber security" lol. Totally legit. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:46:30
Jerk miners.
