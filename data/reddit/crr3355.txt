One is going up and it ain't the car
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:45:45
That didn't answer the question

I agree with your sentiment however most people never actually hold a winning lottery ticket in their hands (on their computer/hard drive whatever) and then let it go out sell it for pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:31:19
Yeah what?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:05:24
It wasn't a losing ticket...we know this. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 12:08:34
500 yrs ago Bitcoin was worthless! Just look at it now. We're doing great.
@_date: 2018-05-11 14:07:27
Probably not since I see multiple people saying this. Probably go down more for several weeks than when everyone thinks it's the end it'll turn around
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:37:51
This seems the most logical based on my TA.
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:43:26
No idea that far out

@_date: 2018-05-15 16:36:32
What if they're going to buy crypto with it and then dump it on us?
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:54:39
Not a chance
@_date: 2018-05-16 16:34:56
Did we just become best friends?
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:43:44
Never going to trust FB with any of my money. Hell no.
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:05:33
Steadily down and staying there until a slight rise at the end of the year back to where we were recently hovering over 9k before eventually breaking 10k and beyond sometime next year. It's going to take a while to get past that hurdle.

So your intent was to simply state a fact that contributes nothing to this conversation
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:03
I think you mean buttcoin

Stop commenting this
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:56:53
That comment always makes me laugh. Like shit hits the fan, government and economy collapse and everyone's like THANK GOD I got these digital coins on my ledger!
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:06:13
Already rich with USD don't wanna risk it
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:52:52
I don't care that you're 17
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:55:23
They are 16.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:20:01
Nobody makes the first jump
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:21:55
Very elaborate. Well done! Go back up now.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:39:45
Well that doesn't make any sense. Hope that was some weird sarcasm
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:24:40
I'm 40% certain I do know.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:09:48
Why do you wanna see them mate? Gross.
