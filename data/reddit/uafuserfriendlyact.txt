@_date: 2017-09-30 10:40:34
lol get your shit together. stop doing drugs. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:51:28
I'll bet you'll be singing a different tune should s2x be a majority chain.

I know. I know.
This the borg be assimilated or get banned.
I just thought I'd chime in.
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:50:50
point to me where that was said. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:19:38
might is the keyword here.
I know I'll be down voted for this.
But you all sit on your high horses like bitcoin is some unstoppable thing. If there is anything, anything that history has taught us is. what can go up. can also go down.
So the way I see it op has 50/50 (in reality it's not a 50/50 but you don't know all the variables especially in a free market like this one) of either making or losing money at this point.  
so saying smart decision is actually a stupid answer. but let's all pretend we're smart and have discovered the secret to wealth without doing anything.

you do realise changetip died before bch was even a thing? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:11:53
and? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 10:00:34
what? people have different ideas? no way! how is that possible? /s
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:59:06
this right here. you think these guys are the only ones smart enough to understand what's going on.
you've not lived in this world enough, there's plenty of smart people out there. and these guys might or might not be smart.
but your petty arguments and portrayal of them as almighty are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:48:24
thanks for making everything so clear. :) 
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:31:28
when it doesn't suit your taste call it voting manipulation.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:43:08
yes. and how do you explain it not being here anymore?
it's due to the fact that it costs a few dollars to do transactions.
and no one is going to amass quantities for which it would make sense to pay those fees on an untrusted 3rd party service.
but if you have a different explanation I'm all ears.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:17:16
this condescending tone is the same one maxy boy likes to use.
so, I'll address him the same way.
as for my account 5 weeks of reddit proves very little, but so does 3 years, and I could tell you I've been around for a long time, but I'm not willing to prove it.
so take my reddit 5 weeks as it is, a 5 week account. troll or not that's your opinion and your call. label me as you see fit. :) 
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:04:56
that's mean. at least I didn't completely ruin his narrative. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:30:51
yeah waiting hours for a transaction will get them hooked for sure! 
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:23:00
would actually like to see proof of dumping his sw2x if he even owns any bitcoin at all...
it's very easy to tell others what to do...
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:26:27
this list is hilarious. you're a funny person. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:46:06
stop throwing that word around.
there are 3 factions. there is consensus within each faction. if you don't like it go cry somewhere else.
this is the nature and freedom of bitcoin. if you can't deal with the fact that anyone is free to do whatever they want (and no adding replay protection is not a must because your faction thinks so) then you truly misunderstood bitcoin and crypto currencies in general.
if one faction deems replay protection is needed, they should add it. the fact that they don't shows they only care about being the bitcoin and know for a fact that replay protection makes it seem like they are diverging.
truth is... both are diverging, whichever ones deems replay important will implement it.
there is no, you are forking, you need to do this or that. 
the perspective from where you stand makes you think the others are forking when in reality the other side sees it just the same way. you are forking from them.
do yourself a favour, grab a drink and sit this one out. it's clearly too much for you to grasp.
and that goes for and his crew.
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:32:27
BCC can not be compared to this case. It was clearly a minority fork and it's developers agreed to put in replay protection.
however sw2x has a lot more backing and you can not clearly and cleanly state which chain has majority. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:20:36
so hashrate is not important?
right let me sit here and watch you do an emergency hard fork so your bitcoin core does not become irrelevant overnight. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:54:58
yeah that's the spirit. ;)
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:34:46
op is the is your source. you doubt his word? 
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:49:38
ultimately this just proves how the argument changes to justify this non sense.
nodes are worth very little.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:22:13
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:36:44
that's the community spirit I like!
just call anyone you don't agree with a shit pumper! alright! fuck arguments and facts! 
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:47:02
maxy boy you're a scientist!
and to think you didn't want to go down in bitcoin history! so humble! hahahaha
come on over here maxy boy and give the crowd some of your glorious words!
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:03:01
yeah ok. go on... 
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:08:04
well that's your view. And your so called majority of the users is clearly not true.
reddit is not the majority of the users and let's be fucking honest for one second. this sub does not let talk of alt coins surface!
sw2x is considered an altcoin in this sub, so how the fuck is anyone supposed to voice their opposition to you all?
this sub is biased and this shows in your arguments at to why sw2x is an alt. all you can do is claim majority and point to reddit.
and don't point me to your website that lists everyone against sw2x since those are business and I could easily argue that bitcoin is being held hostage by corporates, which seems to be the sentiment for sw2x. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:09:48
instead of trying to insult how about you point out the flaws in my logic.
insulting is the easy way out for when you have no arguments. I'm going to assume you're just a bit hot headed when someone doesn't agree with you, but you can actually debate. So please enlighten me.
