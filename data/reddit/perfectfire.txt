Sounds easy until:


Seriously, I've been trying to buy bitcoins for about the last 4 hours. I was going to try Circle, but they don't mention bitcoins anywhere. I guess I'll give them a try.

Uh, maybe I'm not understanding this correctly, but it seems that you're just doing an extra check ~~for a hash collision~~ to see if the nonce you used to generate a hash value below the bitcoin target just happens to also be a nonce that generates a hash that is also below the namecoin target. Unless the namecoin and bitcoin headers are exactly the same wouldn't this be an extremely rare occurrence?

What does "difficulties don't draw levels" mean (sorry I'm a n00b when it comes to *coins, but not computer science).  I don't like the ticket analogy.  I read it several times and it seems as though the writer has no clue how mining works or is just way way way oversimplifying the explanation.  I searched for hours for a technical explanation, but couldn't find one.

Ah, so if a miner doesn't add any transactions to the block then the value of the merkle root field will just me the SHA2-256 hash of 0 or just plain 0?
Thanks so much for explaining!

Thanks.  I have follow-up questions. Why would a block header of an unsolved block have any transactions at all? What are these transactions and where are they coming from? And why *wouldn't* there be billions of transaction additions per second?
@_date: 2011-09-02 18:20:35
But, how could that transaction exist until the block is solved and 50 BTC are generated?

You're not trying to generate a merkle root to 'solve' a block.  When trying to solve a block the merkle root is just a part of the block header that is the root node of a merkle tree of ['all recent transactions']( or possibly ['all of the transactions']( (both of those statements are ambiguous and seemingly contradictory).
What you're trying to do when solving a block is finding a nonce *n* such that when *n* is appended to the rest of the [block header field values]( it yields a hash value less than the current target value. The hash function for block solving is the SHA256 value of the SHA256 value of the block header.
The page about [block header hashing]( states that the block header field values change from time to time.  For example real life current time changes every second, but the current time value in the block header only needs to be updated every few seconds. The part I'm fuzzy on is initial merkle root, what triggers a change in the merkle root and how often that change happens:
* What are the transactions that go into calculating the initial merkle root ('all recent transactions' or ' all of the transactions' is pretty ambiguous)
* Where it says that the merkle root changes when 'a transaction is accepted' what does that mean? From the [description of transactions]( I would assume that transactions happen very frequently, so wouldn't this cause the merkle root to change very often. As in mulitple times per millisecond often?
