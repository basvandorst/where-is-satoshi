The implication in all of these posts, sometimes explicitly stated, is that these predict the next big bull run. Literally every single big downswing this year have this type of post.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:08:44
You people using technical analysis to predict stuff are insane. This entire year I've seen nothing but these exact same type of posts with the exact "identical" patterns.

President Trump is a retarded treasonous mentally ill criminal. Otherwise I'm very satisfied with my life :)
Oh yea, and his supporters are even more vile and stupid than Trump is. That's why the official language of his supporters are failed memes and copy pastas.

Congrats on your sale and thanks for answering the question :)
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:46:41
Okay got it, I agree with you that Trump is a retarded liar too. Glad we agree.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:26:28
Are you referring to moron Trump supporters who have no rational arguments left to defend Trump and defaults to retarded memes as a rebuke of the countless legitimate criticisms of Trump?
You lowest denominator types are parasites on the productivity of society. I'm really happy that you vile and disgusting people will be left behind even more quickly as technology develops. Good luck with your "memes" in the future, I'm sure that'll elevate your lives after all the jobs your type can do gets automated away.

No no, me calling Truptards vile is backed with evidence. It's not a slur, it's a fact based description.
Glad you moved on from hounding me about "accusations without proof" by the way. Funny how quickly Trumptards drop a supposed criticism when they realize their Dear Leader also does it.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:50:49
Glad we're in agreement that he's a retarded liar.
Also, you seem to have a problem with people accusing others of being criminals without a criminal conviction. Another reason that President Trump is such a retard for repeatedly going on about how Hillary is a criminal huh?
Boy you Trumptards sure aren't hypocrites who hold random strangers on the internet to higher moral standards than Donald Fucking Trump.
Thanks for proving my point about Trumptards and how stupid and vile they are. Enjoy your Christmas, work on that introspection a little bit better. Thanks for taking the bait.

When other secretary of defenses left, there was a transition.
Trump like the hyper sensitive snowflake he is go so upset about Mattis' resignation letter than he forced him out immediately with no plan to handle the transition.
I'm amazed there's still morons dumb enough to defend Trump. The guy is almost cartoonish in how stupid, awful, criminal, and incompetent he is. If anyone still defends him, a quick "are we the baddies" conversation needs to happen in their brain.
By the way, hating Trump does not mean supporting Hillary or the democrats. It means not being a partisan moron and being a rational thinker who knows that having an emotional unstable idiot in the highest office is bad for all of us.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:07:47
Nope, Trump is a vile criminal. Please take the bait.

You realize that the last market crash saw a loss of 50%? And that was deemed so severe that our country changed forever from it?
And here you have people who lost 80% feeling "worried" for stock holders? No guys, stocks are not going to crash like bitcoin, stocks represents shares of actual value generating assets. The difference between the two is that if you bought all the bitcoin in the world and let it sit, in a hundred years, you'll still have just all the bitcoins in the world. But if you bought all the stocks, you own all the companies, and these companies produce more and more goods/services every year as well as reinvest in themselves to develop new technology/methods that will make them even more efficient at creating goods and services. With the development in AI, we will likely see a productivity explosion in those companies in the coming years. So 100 years after owning all the stocks, you will have 100 years worth of goods/services generated from those companies. Imagine how much value was created from the top 500 companies in America over the last 100 years.
Meanwhile, bitcoin creates nothing.

I agree, that kind of comeback is so stupid. Glad we agree Donald Trump is stupid and a child.
Want to take more baits?
Trump is so vile that any legitimate criticisms you think you may have of me will be something Trump has already done. Keep criticizing Trump for me. Take the bait.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:39:29
How far back and how long do you want the list to be? Do you want to start with the oldest first or newest? I don't even know which ones to start, Trump University? Or racially discriminating tenants? 
Oh hang on, what's your view on settlements? Has Donald Trump ever settled before? Or is he a liar when he says he doesn't settle?
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:05:50
Because my president is a criminal incompetent moron.
@_date: 2018-12-07 08:30:59
I'm just curious how much people have invested that is making them stress out so much about the price. Is it a few hundred? A few thousand? More?
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:42:53
I'll start with Trump talking about making Mexico pay for the wall for two years and now forcing it on taxpayers.

This is absolutely not true except for gold which is essentially the same as bitcoin except it has some industrial uses and is otherwise worse and more costly to use than bitcoin.
Stocks and real estate generate actual STUFF and SERVICES. Most people invest in these ASSETS because they generate STUFF and SERVICES.
Like I said, add up all the STUFF and SERVICES produced by corporations over the last 100 years and compare that with gold which is very analogous to bitcoin in how little GOODS and SERVICES it generates.
So take all the cars, appliances, computers, cellphones, airplanes, ships, furniture, houses, skyscrapers, software, movies, music, medical procedures, medicine, private education, books, etc, add them all up, and that's what corporations have generated over the last 100 years.
Compare that with what gold generated over the last hundred years... pretty much nothing. This is the same as bitcoin today. In a hundred years, corporations will have created countless spaceships, self driving cars, advanced AI, far better medical care, better and more education services, not to mention food, cellphones, computer games, etc. And during that span, bitcoin will create not much except for facilitating a some portion of financial transactions.
If I had money today, I'd buy the thing that creates the future. I would not buy the thing that sits there and gets passed around. We can look at literally ALL the massively adopted mediums of exchange in the past and we will see that none of them even come close to out performing assets like stocks. Even things that can't be printed like gold (sure some mining goes on, but lots of gold is lost too and the actual usable supply hasn't changed in meaninful ways).

So you think that someone repeating something makes a fool out of himself? Glad you agree with me Trump was a stupid fool for the whole Mexico paying for the wall thing. I agree he's a moron fool.
