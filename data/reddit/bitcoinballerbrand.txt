Listen to this guy. Buy more and average down your buy in price. BTC will be back up in a few days not to worry.

Segwit, batch transactions, reduce in spam transactions, etc. Coinbase finally upgraded their systems which results in more efficient transactions.

Good luck on your next ventures.
I hope there is a way to easily divide up the remaining money amongst those that lost in ratio to the amounts they lost. We know there is lots of database backups and hopefully everyone will be able to have a nice ending.
It takes alot for you to do a post like this. I hope these are not false words and you actually give back to the community and people that lost.
