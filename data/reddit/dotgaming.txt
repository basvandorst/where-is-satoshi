You'd have to connect it with some kind of contract irl, essentially the easiest system would be to officially document wallets in public documents and say that a single satoshi in these is worth the ownership of a product. If the satoshi is sent to another registerd address you transfer ownership. You could make this possible by having a centralised public database which makes this info accessible, anyone who joins this database would have to agree legally that the balances are equal to ownership. Utilising the blockchain, you now have a record of how any ownership was transferred. 
You would generate an address, add a satoshi, and say this satoshi would represent your Tesla. Party b would make an address and say it's only there to accept that Tesla, if the Satoshi is transferred from a to b you also have the ownership going from a to b.

Are guys on planning towards expanding into the USD market with a similar no fee structure as present on OKCoin? There seriously needs to be some competition in the USD based markets!
Also, would there be a possibility of you guys creating a vps service for bots to reduce latency? It would really help people trading at high frequencies.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:14:58
Which is not at all true as the spread would cause you to lose money over time. And no, you can't make two bots trade with each other, I tried, either okcoin blocks you for two requests from the same IP, or someone places another order to catch yours in those 20ms.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:22:01
OKCoin alone has over 120k BTC volume today.

Actually, I see you posted in the initial thread, you can get the whole bounty before if you want. Remember to remove any personal info (change your password if you use the current one for anything else).
Appreciate it, as a mod of this sub I want to help everyone out by making a thread detailing the current withdrawal status from a more trusted source.

Those are some very good concerns, this model would probably be better suited as an investment. A useful thing is that the function can be made so the price can restabilise by increasing the supply if mining power goes up, and decreasing it when it goes down, without letting people mess with it by turning huge pools on and off, only those who hold the coin (and would therefore have huge losses) could influence a pump and dump, and this can be done via markets anyways.

 I'd like to apply for modship too,
I currently mod with over 70K subs, so I am used to how moderating, approving and the like works, I browse the new queue on most subbreddit I visit, and I actively report posts.
I can guarantee activity for at least 8 hours a day, usually 5pm-11pm CET, I enjoy actively removing spam and participating in discussion, as well as making subreddits a lot better as a whole.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:32:40
Everyone, be extremely careful here, there is a chance that this site is not legit, the 1.5BTC minimum cashout as well as the account ages are some indicators.

The point is to make mining more inneficient when there is an increased stake, if returns half with double the stake, then getting 2 seperate investments is as inneficient as adding one big investment.
As an example, burning coins in two 100 coin wallets would get more coins theoretically, but this is not true as you have to wait twice as long, as you now have tind 2 blocks. This works mathematically as adding half as many coins as there are in the pool makes your stake 1/3, and not 1/2. The function can be adjusted to keep any certain percentage as efficient as possible, but it's best to make the reward similar at all level.
Edit: a 1% inflation model shows the logarithmic properties here with a 10coin and 5coin investement, showing convergence and the efficiency varying 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:50:55
Hence the warning, sadly I can't get definitive proof yet, I am currently investigating this.

As the guy who wrote [this post]( I cannot for the life of me understand why people don't understand something so simple.
I even wrote a bot to trade **millions of USD** in terms of volume per day with a single btc, why did it get downvoted so badly?
No, they're not faking volume, I think I showed enough proof in my post.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:57:39
OKcoin and houbi for plain trading.

If they pose as a second user, they will have to find 2 blocks instead of one, meaning that the discouragement through returns is still the same.

You can message us if there is an issue with your post, but throwing a tantrum does not help your cause, we sometimes delete things that shouldn't be deleted, and sometimes there might be a more controversial reason, we are always open to discuss this.
But you are blatantly trying to stirr up controversy here, I have no idea if you're trolling or not, but you messaged us and complained about not getting a response after **6 minutes**, you are typing in bold eveywhere and making everything seem more dramatic than it actually is.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:56:36
Of course it does happen, but you should always remain calm and contact us before making assumptions and accusing people, it can cause a giant mess.

We don't delete anything about altcoins unless it has no relation to Bitcoin at all, whether the post is positive or negative is none of our concern.

Very good point, setting the equation to ((y/100)x-(x/z))+x instead of ((y/100)x-(2x/z))+x wouldkeep this from occuring untill 50% (at which the coin would have bigger difficulties anyways), if I did the math right.

The general  assumption is that tx fees will carry  enough  value to keep once time for miners.  Blocks still need to be processed after.
