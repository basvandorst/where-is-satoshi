Well, Buffett has never shorted anything, and I am not even sure how you could go about shorting Bitcoin in the first place. To my knowledge, there are no clearinghouse lending bitcoins for use in a short, and I doubt anyone would be willing to buy bitcoins futures in order to conduct a naked short.

Yeah, I am not familiar with this part of the Constitution, but based on my knowledge of history, I know in early US history there were state banks that issued their own currency and even private banks that issued their own "money" sometimes refereed to "wildcat money."

It's not surprising Warren Buffett is skeptical of Bitcoin. He is a numbers guy. He doesn't invest in any companies that have not been profitable for 10 years running, and he makes a decision after carefully looking at the fundamentals of a company, including its profit margins, debt, competitive advantage. He is a smart investor. It's one thing to get lucky on any investment, it's another to consistently pick winners like Warren has for decades. It's not a secret. He is a safe investor, a patient investor. It has paid off for him. He wouldn't have become a billionaire by jumping on every bandwagon that comes along, even if that means he misses some great opportunities. He sticks to what works. So, just because you disagree with him, you cannot deny his credentials, and it should be obvious why he would dismiss crypto currencies in general.

Their customers were not complicit in the banks buying risky derivatives and bonds from insolvent countries. All this does is hurt peoples confidence in the banking system, something that has been hard bought in the west since the bank run days of the great depression.
