No iffense but servers and bartenders dint want to be your "friend" . We want to provide you with good service and be tipped well in return. There is NOTHING worse than the guy whos your "buddy" and that is supposed to replace a tip

Yea americans tip well.. I find it cringe worthy that europeans arr so pathetically cheap and dont tip well

Hey man thats not bad at all whatever one can.. Im just fortunate two work two jobs and have relatively low daily expenses (when im not doing dope) lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:29:50

This guy is a complete slime ball.. Fucking douchey if you ask me and sketchy
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:42:13
Thats when I quit and I figured I survived spending 100 a day on dope.. Why not put that 100 a day into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:45:18
Um because no investment goes up everyday all day... Are you fucking 15 or something?
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:53:09
Seriously, its crashes almost 40% in a day or two recently, then has a dead cat bounce... What did this guy think it was going to bounce right up past 5k??? Whys it dipping??? Um maybe because it dead cat bounced and now is chilling out... The same way every single stock and tradable commodity in the world does... Fucking newbs
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:58:15
Reason for current dip? Not to sound rude but I bet you dont have a basic understanding of trading or investing. It's really as simple as nothing ALWAYS goes up ALL of the time. Its dipping.because people take profits! Its dipping because there are more sepp orders than buy orders. Its dipping because nobody wants to pay a higher price for btc at the moment. Its completely retarded to ask whats the reason the price isnt going up?? Wahhhh.. Every dip. WTF
