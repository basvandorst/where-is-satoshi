Yeah...have to say I think I'm one of the few who beat the system. My 8800GTS died so I needed a new card anyway, so got the card I was going to get (6870 for 165), and am using the mining profits (70 so far) to pay it down. Free money

Sort of the inherent issue with ANY nongovernmental currency though is that since you get paid in dollars or pounds or yen, and not bitcoins, you're going to have to do that conversation some point.
And that's sort of the biggest issue with using them as currency, that the exchange rate is key since they have no intrinsic value in themselves

Actually is was more like a jump from 8 to 13, but, still.
Apparently someone/a very coordinated group of people took their computing power offline (or kept it dormant), then threw it all back on right after the change.
At this rate, the next difficulty leap will be in 5 days...

 is going to be the best you can get. They use a rating system for knowing how people have done business in the past. Without some sort of authority arbitrating the whole thing, that's really the best you can get.
I imagine individual to individual transactions as they go in old west or crime movies:
*Cowboy: You got the gold?
*Desperado: Yeah, got the goods?
*Cowboy: Yeah, now give me the goods!
*Desperado: Not until I see my money!
....then they both have a gunfight. So yeah, I can see why you'd want that system, it'd be awesome!

Hmmm...tried that, and still getting GPU artifacts, even with full fan speed. But thanks for the tip
@_date: 2011-07-05 02:45:44
Right, so let's call it a v-blog, or a vlog. In this video, the dude doesn't even mention bitcoin. And I'm not going to waste my time watching any other ones.
@_date: 2011-07-06 23:32:49
I LOVE your case!
@_date: 2011-06-23 06:46:54
That's true, but it's also the same amount of light that you can see with your eyes closed.
@_date: 2011-06-16 22:49:40
It's not, but, the only thing they said to the DEA was that it was trackable. The only reason the DEA is interested in you is if they're suspecting you of drug crimes. You're still anonymous as long as nobody goes through the pain in the ass of actually trying to track your coins. Anonymity is different from being untraceable.
@_date: 2011-06-19 20:40:07
Yeah, any of the other exchanges would have been equally screwed if the had the volume MtGox has. 
I think the issue more is just how EVERYONE trades on MtGox, to the point that volume for the other exchanges is under 100BTC per day.
It'd be great if this whole thing caused people to go to other exchanges, because then by decentralizing it, you wouldn't have the problem of 1 exchange being down causing an almost complete market shutdown.
@_date: 2011-06-16 02:20:31
Damn straight. Was on the fence about a cheaper gtx460 vs. a more expensive 6870. This tipped me to the AMD side for sure.
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:36:10
The problem is that the use of bitcoins wherever you are is intimately linked to the currency your country uses. People don't get paid in bitcoins, they get paid in dollars. You can't pay taxes in bitcoins, you pay in dollars. And for the exchange of goods, what's going to matter isn't how many bitcoins you can get for something. It's how many bitcoins you can get, which you will have to trade for dollars at some point down the line.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:58:31
Indeed, and a good move on their part. They hadn't yet when I posted this.

Head here!
You get 0.001 free, that should help you do what you need to do :)

How is that remotely progressive? The basic message is that the central banks controls interest rates to affect the economy in the way they see fit or deem necessary...that's just how it works
@_date: 2011-10-08 05:54:19
I think the negative value of BTC predicted by that graph makes it somewhat suspect...

Brother, you need to get a life
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:54:52
The rate is only going to get lower, that's how the system is setup. That's also why CPU mining used to be viable, it was fine when the difficulty was lower.
Here a chart of the history of difficulty over time.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:17:09


Edit: Anyone else having this issue? I've quadruple checked my account info and it still won't let me in
@_date: 2011-07-05 01:09:58
Blogspam, and not even about bitcoin
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:35:46
Nope, and I think the situation is such that, before May, the price of bitcoins weren't high enough for mining to be financially lucrative. Now, since the difficulty is exceeding the ability of even GPUs, the only people it's going to be attractive for are people who already have the hardware. In a month, you'll have to have crossfire setups to get the levels we're getting today. A month after that you'll need multiple machines.
Which, in fairness, mirrors the actual gold mining process. We're past the point where you could find it easily in the rivers, we're at the point now where you can dig your own mine, and are heading where you have to be pretty rich or already be established to get in the game.
So, unless the price of bitcoins hit 100 dollars or something, not going to be good anyone but hardcore miners.

Do any of the other exchanges have circuit breaks? I don't know, that's an honest question. I would assume with such a small volume, they wouldn't.
MtGox does have security problems, but those are only apparent because it's constantly tested because it's orders of magnitude larger than any other exchange. I feel like any of the others would be having similar issues right now were they in MtGox's shoes.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:10:08
It's still what's on the site, check for yourself
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:46:02
Really?? With the price of bitcoin in steady decline for the last week? With the difficulty about to go up?? With the break even point for those cards, even if the price and difficulty stayed constant (which they won't), at a full two months??
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:39:58
But for most fluorescents, you have to expose them to light to recharge them. If they're on the undersides of your eyelids, you'll need to turn them inside out for a period every so often to be able to use them
@_date: 2011-06-15 23:42:20
Helped with lag, not so much with the artifacts, even though my temps are low (65c) and fan on full. Thanks though!

You forgot the link?
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:43:10
Not saying they don't have good security or aren't trustworthy, I don't know anything about them. 
I think it's important for people to remember that bitcoin has only been around this price level for a few weeks, and most of the sites built with it in mind are small time operations. Now granted, that doesn't mean they shouldn't be secure, but it does mean that a lot things are going to happen that are pretty unforeseen.
@_date: 2011-06-14 13:30:08
Financially, the only attractive thing to me about bitcoin is mining. I'm using a video card I own anyway, and don't have to pay utilities, so even if the value goes to crap again, I don't actually lose anything. I just come out with a couple cents or dollars instead of tens or hundreds.
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:41:18
That's a lot...what's you method for remembering those?
@_date: 2011-06-15 16:07:17
Honestly man, I'd say probably not. By the time you pick out your components, get them ordered, get the machine built, the difficulty will have gone up again. I just started with a 6850, yesterday I was getting 0.4BTC per day, now it's down to 0.25 per day. By the time it goes up next time (less than 2 weeks), I'd assume it'll be no more than 0.15 per day.
Assuming the price stays at around $20/BTC (big assumption), that's 3 dollars a day...so in two weeks I'll make 40 bucks. The next period, I'll probably get no more than .08 per day, or $1.50 a day. Over two weeks that's 20 more dollars. Project that out, the next pay periods are 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25.
So over 3 months, I'll get a max of around 80 bucks. If you start at the next difficulty level with a card about like mine (I get 215MH/s), you'll get around 40 over 3 months.
Now, if that's on a graphics card you were going to buy anyway, hey, it's free money. But if you're trying to justify the purchase of a more expensive card, or worse yet, cards, it's probably not going to end up being a good business proposition.

Every account on the site got hacked, and it crashed the market. Of course they should roll it back.
@_date: 2011-06-16 13:05:56
Since when was being able to carry out 100% anonymous, illegal transactions part of the reason for the bitcoin ecosystem?
