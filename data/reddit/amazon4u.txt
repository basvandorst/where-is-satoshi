Have you heard of employment benefits ? or employment ? I wouldn't trust you to walk my dog though....my dog would end up walking you and I will have to pay for it....no thanks...your incompetence has no limits, but I do admire your thirst of vengeance....I just have to call your name a couple of time (retard) and you keep on posting....keep up the good work, I need more people like you....

 Anybody reading my 18000+ views thread can find the answers for the questions you've asked, so that only leaves me to say this :
Thank you "Proudclown" for promoting my business, you are retarded enough to do that for free ! Thank you again !

That is a good question....but the conspiracy lovers don't like using logic very much because it denies them the conspiracies they love so much....but let's suppose for one second that indeed stolen credit cards are used to purchase the gift cards, how long you guys think it takes for Amazon to cancel the gift cards ? I have been selling LOTS and LOTS of gift cards for several months now in a 500+ reply thread with more than 18000 views (plenty of positive feedback I guess) and NOBODY reported a SINGLE PROBLEM with my gift cards ...how long you think it takes for Amazon to cancel 20+ fraudulent $2000 USD vouchers  ?? how many months ?? how many years ??? :) Just curious to know if you like the real word or you prefer day dreaming...
Anyways, I am doing the same thing on Purse (the service that everyone praised), I have a VIP account (the kind of account that you can't get normally) on purse.io, the genius that  started this Reddit post said that I bought it ... How can he prove that ? I proved that I own the VIP account by making a screenshot.
 
Here it is again...
 My business is on Purse.io and on Bitcointalk as well, and now on Reddit....This is actually very good publicity for me...Thank you "haters", I wish I thought of impersonating ProudBitcoiner and creating the Reddit post myself, but that would've been just too "machiavellic" of me :) , so I guess that thank you "Proudclown" is more appropriate

Close, but not close enough....close enough for dementia though

you are retarded...Bring the FBI/CIA/NSA to this thread, my business is legit and you are giving me free publicity...like I said, you should try that on Facebook and other social networks....let the world know about my service...Purse or Bitcointalk.....I have been selling Amazon gift cards for months in high numbers, if there was a problem with just one of them , a guy on Bitcointalk would've said that Amazon cancelled his gift card...but where is that guy ??? That guy doesn't exist because my gift cards are legitimate and Amazon doesn't have a reason to cancel them.....I even sold gift cards to purse at 18% discount, here is the screenshot RETARD :
So even Purse.io gets a lot of my business....I even sell gift cards directly to Purse.io when the price is right, of course, not at 25%....I have Bitcointalk for that...
Now about the Purse account..... the Purse account is mine, 0 BTC in Escrow means that I had 0 transactions at the time of the screenshot...so  how does that mean that I bought a Purse account genius ? You haven't used Purse once in your lifetime or else I cannot explain why you are so stupid....0 BTC in ESCROW = means I did not have any transactions going at the time of the screenshot...Because I am a VIP member on Purse I "hunt" for good prices ( 10 ~15% ) and those are not available daily, I choose what order I make on Purse because I am VIP member...
get it now Einstein ???? 10% discount is not something you find daily on Purse.io...if I want volume Bitcointalk does the job very well at 25%....I use both in a very different way but still in a very efficient way....
Regarding the mixing service you keep repeating, that's a trading platform (Bitfinex/BTC-e) converting my BTC to USD in order to stay safe from the BTC - USD price swings...I keep 80% of the funds in USD so of course that after each order, I convert the BTC immediately to USD....there is no mixing involved, it's just a BTC-USD conversion on a TRADING PLATFORM .....do you even know what a TRADING PLATFORM is proud bitcoiner ? 
you are a proud "bitcoiner" but you give BITCOIN a bad name in that association...you should try "retardbitcoiner" that would be  more appropriate

FBI has to want to get me first....they need a legitimate reason...I think the Inquisition in the 17th century would've got me though, they didn't need many reasons to get you back than...

If you had a good laugh, it was well worth it...
@_date: 2015-03-01 13:55:52
Whenever you feel ready...Either message me here or on Bitcointalk.org where I do most of my trades....
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:29:25
Thanks for trying my services. Enjoy your item !
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:53:41
Thanks Chris, I hope you'll try my services again ...Cheers

Why is this a scam man ? Are you crazy ? You pay for your stuff after you receive it !! Every add on Reddit is  scam to you ? 
Some people are just paranoid I guess...
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:20:30
Please explain...why do you think is shady ? The customer pays for the items after they receive them ... I don't believe there is anything shady in that... I honestly think it's quite fair....If you wanna have an open discussion based on arguments I am ready for that , but if you want to throw dirt at me, I'm gonna step down..
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:45:36
Erik, there are no credit cards involved in the process. All the orders are paid with physical Gift Cards... like Chris said if this would be a credit card scheme I would've been able to buy from any website...not just Amazon...Anyways all will be be crystal clear once Chris receives his order and I hope more people will be using my services
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:52:18
I am only offering a service similar to   or  . You receive your items and pay for them afterwards...25% off
Thank you for using my services, I am not familiar with Reddit as most of my businesses are conducted on  but I'll be happy to work with Reddit members as well . Go Bitcoin !
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:01:48
Why do you think this is a scam ? Have you heard of  , they are offering the same services...Also how is this a scam if I am sending first ?
The end-user doesn't take any risks since he pays after he receives his goods.... I am not sure what is your definition of "scam" but we sure have different meanings for the same word....
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:29:49
I am not doing any charity... I am sorry you understood that...It is just business with fair terms...something people here are very suspicious of...that's quite ironic if you ask me
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:24:39
If this is the Reddit community I've heard so many great things about, I'd rather be someplace else....sorry to bother you
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:50:21
If I am gonna get too popular, I'm gonna hire more people :) I am experimenting with Reddit actually, most of my business is done on Bitcointalk.org or Purse.io .  Anyways it was nice doing business with you and I hope I can do your Amazon shopping again . :) Cheers
