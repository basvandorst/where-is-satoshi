The stock market is doing great. What the hell are you smoking?

I know that Segwit would fix this problem. The issue is the fact that bitcoin was built to be a democracy between the users/nodes/miners and the vast majority of hashpower has not adopted Segwit. That is the market talking.
I don't have a horse in the race. But for people who preach decentralization and individual control, this sub seems to be very anti free market.

I am glad that we are not as far apart on these issues as it first appeared and I agree with you that speed is not the main concern of the project. I don't want to imply that it is or that the lack of speed will kill bitcoin - because it won't. However, it will make mass adoption less likely.
Even though the speed feature is secondary to decentralized/trustless/permissionless features in terms of the bitcoin project, speed is a major concern for people who actually want to use bitcoin as a currency to pay for things in their daily lives. That's the issue to be addressed with scaling - the whole topic of this thread.

I do understand that the whole idea of proof of work is that it cannot be cheated. If it can be cheated, it is not a true proof of work.


ASICBOOST violates these security assumptions because they were bad assumptions - there was nothing programmed into bitcoins' proof of work to ensure that these principles would be held so you should not expect them to be. Bitcoin was supposed to be designed so that what is good for the individual is good for the network - by your own admittance, it has failed at this.
This all implies that bitcoin doesn't have a true proof of work while there exists other "shitcoins" that do.
Tl;dr Other people aren't cheating by being more efficient, Bitcoin is flawed because of the fact that other people can be more efficient.

Actually I have heard that these are going to be cash-settled contracts. Meaning that, by design, no bitcoin ever changes hands - only cash.
So the contract doesn't entitle you to delivery of a bitcoin it only entitles you to delivery of the cash equivalent of the price of a bitcoin.

What are you talking about? Clearly not the US, European, Japanese or Chinese stock markets.
In the US the DJIA (which is where most of the gains come from):
It's up over 24% for the last 12 months.
It's up over 7% for the last 3 months.
It's up over 2% for the last 1 month.
It's down less than 0.5% for the last 5 days.
If this is your definition of dropping like crazy then I'd hate to see your opinion of BTC after it just dropped over 12% in the last 5 days.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:22:45
Yeah, that's fair.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:36:46
It is free market because there was inefficiency in POW and someone capitalized on it to make the miners more efficient. It is a free market to let people innovate as they see fit. Is it a good thing overall? I don't have any opinion on that because it doesn't really matter what I think, it matters what the miners actually do - and they have not supported Segwit (&lt;20%). That appears to me as a free market making a decision.

If you find yourself in unmanageable debt over superficial items like that then you deserve whatever you get. That's how Mr. Market operates. People provide credit for a fee because others want it. 
Credit is a good thing not a bad thing. Having manageable debt on appreciating assets that produce cash flow is how you can leverage what you have to become much wealthier.
Just because most people don't understand how to be financially responsible doesn't mean that debt is inherently bad.
Unmanageable debt is bad. Manageable debt is great.

I understand this very clearly. You were being disingenuous suggesting that VISA and bitcoin transactions aren't comparable when they absolutely are. They are not apples and oranges at all.
VISA is just layer 2 or 3 of the banks just like the lightning network will be to bitcoin. Therefore they are perfectly analogous and suitable for comparison. I think this is not too hard to understand.

I make a new account every week or so. Sue me.
Do you have a point you were making or just ad hominem because of my date?

If you're not here to shamelessly shill bitcoin to the moon why do you even have internet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:15:34
But the Russians own facebook and twitter stock too! People in Russia shouldn't be allowed to own publicly traded American companies! They shouldn't even be allowed to comment on our political system - that's interference!
My personal favorite was that they "hacked the election" as if the election was some type of computer or server and the Russians brute-forced the password.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:49:23
Why would you expect people to obey rules that don't exist?
Why would anyone not do that? If Satoshi wanted something else to happen he should've coded a better POW. 
This is the real world so any legal exploit will be used to make money.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:52:48
Yes, bitcoin futures appear to be a necessary predecessor to a bitcoin ETF.
Well all of the contracts will be cash-settled (according to a previous poster) so while people will be betting on the price of bitcoin there will be no bitcoin ever delivered through these contracts by design.
It is creating a lot of good questions and for many of the answers I think we will just have to "wait and see." Should be a fun ride.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:23:23
Now THAT would be scary.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:46:46
Yeah it's just the first step.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:26:49
What's the point of processing transactions quickly?
I can't believe I really have to answer this...
How about buying goods and services? You know, the whole purpose of currencies?
If you think the checkout line takes too long now, imagine when everyone's paying with bitcoin and it takes 2 hours to pay for a cheeseburger - never mind the $6 fee to spend $5.
I'm over here irate that the "chip" now takes 10x longer than the traditional swipe - and others want to wait hours for transactions to go through in the name of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:57:17
You say "cheating" as if the ASICs somehow break the rules of bitcoin but the rules are programmed into it and this is just a consequence of how it was programmed. It's open source so anyone can fix that particular exploit and many people have. But they are all just "pumping shitcoins" in your opinion.
Bitcoin is open source and operates democratically between the users/nodes/miners so people vote with their money and electricity. This is how it was intended to work whether you like the results or not.
I understand your point of view and there are consequences when it comes to weak hands/strong hands - but that is the nature of a free market, which bitcoin was always intended to be.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:11:00
Of course they are different technologies - that is the whole point. If they were the same we wouldn't be having any discussion at all.
They are, however, comparable in this sense if you want bitcoin to be adopted on a massive scale and be used for daily transactions - much like a credit card is. 
If you want to take market share from the currencies in circulation you need to be better than they are at accomplishing things that people do with currencies. I know VISA isn't a currency but a 3rd party that interacts between banks and users. 
If there is no bitcoin equivalent, in terms of use for the consumer, then mass adoption is a moonshot.

1) Drive people to your site

I understand that. It will make bitcoin a viable investment for people in their IRA and brokerage accounts rather than the risk of putting money into the next Mt. Gox. That is huge.
But bitcoin frequently undergoes swings that would trigger circuit breakers - so what happens to those people's options when CME products stop trading but bitcoin keeps moving?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:36:43
I also hate when people conflate the terms shill and troll.
They were never the same thing until the last election. Classic mass media misunderstanding what they are talking about.
Trolls try to fuck with you for fun. Shills try to mislead you for profit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:34:52
No one was talking about the technology on the back end - and I did say they are very different technologies, that's the whole point of bitcoin.
We were all discussing the number of transactions per second and the front end experience for users. You dismissed this as being an unfair comparison but it isn't if the goal is to be used as a daily currency.
Lightning Network does transactions in a side chain which then settles on the main chain (layer 1) at a later time. VISA does transactions as a 3rd party which then settles with the banks (layer 1) at a later time.
Seems pretty similar to me. Certainly apt for comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:34:17
The man discovered the exploit and patented a method to take advantage of it. Isn't economic incentive the whole point of people mining bitcoin in the first place?
There is no point complaining about it - find a way to use what you know to your advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:15:50




Which is it? And please provide a range of dates for the correction or else that is just useless information. There will always be another big correction sometime in the future - that is the nature of markets.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:03:41
You don't need to move the market to make money trading. People trade stocks and bitcoin based on different technical indicators that can reliably make you a profit. Not a profit on every trade but a net profit overall from a strategy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:53:19
No one was comparing Car A and Car B as a whole. We were comparing the "top speed". At which point you implied that you should not even try to compare "top speed" because there are other factors at play. We all know this - yet we were looking at "top speed" as the factor of interest in this particular case. 
Being decentralized doesn't make it any faster, being trustless doesn't make it any faster, being permissionless doesn't make it any faster. In fact, all of those things make it slower. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:50:05
I thought the whole point of bitcoin was being open-source and having decentralized consensus?
Wasn't it founded on the principle of democracy among the users/nodes/miners?
What is happening now is just competition - that's a good thing. Competition drives innovation and ultimately benefits the consumers of a given good/service.
Stop arguing and just be.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:42:39
Yeah, I don't know much about how 'circuit breakers' work either but I did find some info.






At or after 3:25 p.m.—trading shall continue, unless there is a Level 3 halt.




At or after 3:25 p.m.—trading shall continue, unless there is a Level 3 halt.




They will certainly NOT be opt-in as that would defeat the whole purpose of the 'circuit breaker.' The whole concept is meant to stop all trading of certain products for a period of time in order to let people (or algos) slow down and think about what is going on with the price.
I think it creates a lot of interesting questions and I hope someone on here knows more about how these things work than I do. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:59:46
I am all for people making money by any legal means. If we don't think a particular business practice should be legal then make it illegal. Same goes for the bitcoin code.
For example: Tax evasion is a crime but tax avoidance is being smart/resourceful. Does it suck that the richer people are the easier they can get away with paying less taxes? Yes, it sucks bad. But the problem isn't the person who legally avoids paying taxes, the problem is the tax code that allows for things like this to happen in the first place.
Bitcoin/crypto is the wild west, it's survival of the fittest - whatever you want to call it. The only hope is that the market will tend towards the most effective and practical technological applications and solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:46:28
Yeah exactly. I wasn't saying it as a negative I was just pointing out how these specific products are going to work.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:36:59
BTC is not analogous to Berkshire Hathaway at all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:58:15
Yeah it takes some mental gymnastics to actually think about what happened and come to those ridiculous conclusions.
Another great one: "Russian Wikileaks"
Wikileaks is a very reputable source for leaked documents. Not one page of the billions they have published has ever been shown to be fabricated. I don't even think they've ever been accused of fabricating documents.
"Russia was trying to undermine our democracy." 
Yes, by showing that the DNC wasn't being democratic in the primaries. It worked. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:08:17
I'm not saying he is a good person or anything of the sort.
But what he's doing works, is legal and is making money. So don't expect it to stop. The best you can do for yourself is to understand how these types of things work and come up with a strategy to use it to your advantage.
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:56:13
Only 2 ~~wallets~~ addresses have more than 100,000 coins. If bitcoin goes to $1M each then the top 2 ~~wallets~~ addresses will each be worth more than $100B...or about 1/2 of Vladimir Putin's estimated fortune now.
Long story short: the more things change, the more they stay the same.
