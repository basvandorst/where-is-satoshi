Then you should probably phrase your words more carefully, because the mere existence of 80 BU nodes means absolutely nothing, otherwise the science would have to agree that Jesus is real, because there are thousands of churches.
I think the confusion arises from incorrect information about BU. For some reason people present it as "everybody sets their own limit" and somehow "emergent consensus" magically happens.
As I understand it, BU allows you to set how many blocks to wait before accepting one, not the block limit (that's the only way it makes sense anyway).
So the summary of BU is a message:
* "I will accept any blocks you, guys, generate, at the expense of my business, which will now have to wait for something like an hour, before accepting any transactions".
This is how it should be explained, then people won't be confused about it.

It's a bit annoying that you always end arguments about BU with an invitation to continue at bitco.in.
Although understandable :)
I don't want to spend hours arguing either.
Sorry, I've made my decision about bitco.in long time ago and I don't plan to join.
I also thought about BU and the only way it can work is as described in the message. Here's my last try:
Setting block limit on nodes doesn't matter, because nodes have no identity and no PoW.
Let's say you've convinced everybody, except miners, to upgrade to BU. And they all set the limit higher than 2 Mb. Hurray, emergent consensus!
Now what happens if miner Bob creates a 2 Mb block? We will have a fork with both sides _equally valid_ from the point of view of everybody else.
So how would they choose which side is legit? The same way Satoshi invented - by following the longest chain!
Thus it all boils down to the simple fact: the 51% of miners decide.
And so, as I said, the BU message is "we leave the decision to 51% of miners and ready to follow the longest chain at the expense of our business, because we now need a delay of a few blocks to determine what 51% have chosen."

The fact that you convinced 80 people to put a microwave oven under the hood of their cars, which is not connected to anything, is not a proof that microwaves can make cars more efficient. Or that the car won't break down because of it indeed.
Now, if you actually connect it to something and it does some tricks and makes the car work better, _then_ you can point at this small-scale experiment as some sort of proof of concept. And maybe it worked on test net, but that's quite a different matter.
And the microwave is not connected, simply because the code that you added in BU is not executed right now. _It literally doesn't work_.
So, the simple fact that 80 people agreed to put disconnected microwaves under their hood is absolutely irrelevant to anything.
They can claim "I can get my car flying with this microwave TODAY" all they want, but until they actually do, such claims are irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:58:53
Peter, with all due respect, this is not a valid argument.
The fact that 80 BU nodes are running now is not a proof of anything _at all_, because right now all blocks are below 1 Mb and thus all BU nodes behave exactly the same as the old ones.
Now, if they can successfully survive a fork with a larger block, then you can point to it as some sort of proof of something.
Until then you just hurt your own credibility when you go around making silly claims like this. Sorry to sound rude, but I don't know how to put it more politely.

Please consider starting "bitcoin.com/forum/".
I know the early decision was to separate them, but we need a *real* forum now, not a garbage dump bitcointalk has become. A place where regular people can go and not immediately flee in horror.

So you should have said "miners have enough *money to hire* programming expertise", no?
Now let me ask you this: who can you hire when 25 BTC you get from each block cost $6? Who do you think pays the miners?
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:08:55
What if the economic majority + developers switch the hashing algorithm and invalidate current generation of ASIC's?
Such a nuclear option can hurt miners pretty bad...
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:38:29
If a lot of companies decide that having two Bitcoin coins with the same name is ultimately bad for their business, they can firmly reject the old coin.
Yes, you will still be able to trade it on some exchanges but its value will plummet.
The new coin will not have so much hashing power, but then again, the absolute value doesn't mean much if the algorithm is different. More democratized mining would spark new interest in home mining and the new coin will quickly boost its hashing power.
This will also help with mining decentralization (at least until the next generations on ASICs and depending on how the new algorithm will be constructed).

Are you kidding me? I don't know what companies you have in mind, but I think investments in *Bitcoin* companies totaled to about $100 million.
What users are gonna do with miners and a few exchanges, but without BitPay, Blockchain.info and others? What good is a coin with not much places to spend it? You'll be back to 6 dollars in a second!
So you think a coin with 25% of businesses and 75% of miners is more valuable than a coin with 75% of businesses and 25% of miners? Seriously?
And your comment about "programming expertise" of miners is just laughable.
Sorry, you seem so be so deeply misguided that I don't have enough time to untangle your misunderstandings.
@_date: 2015-09-05 11:44:23
I now realized my dissatisfaction with your style of arguing: you switch points with every post so we go in circles.
It goes like this:
* I show you that companies can realistically split
* You say: yeah, but they are worthless
* I show you they are *not* worthless
* You say: yeah, but they would never split
And we're back to square one.
To reply: so you basically *do* argue that a coin with 75% of miners is more valuable than a coin with 75% of businesses?
If that's the case, then sorry, that's some fundamental economic misunderstanding, maybe justus has more time to help you with it :) And he's way better at explaining where "value" comes from.
Or, let me guess, you will say "yeah, but EM will never switch to CPU-only coin"?
Really, if you just like talking for the sake of talking, this is a waste of time...
@_date: 2015-09-17 06:01:37
I am not familiar with how p2p pool works exactly, but shouldn't the same work be distributed to participants? Otherwise, what's the difference from mining alone? And since it's the same work, then it's the same block.
@_date: 2015-09-04 09:48:52
You pose your last question as a rhetorical one, but it's far from clear which one will be valuable and which one will die.
What is more valuable, 400 PH/s hashing power or something like 75% of all Bitcoin users and companies? Where do you think that 4 billion value lies?
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:37:36


@_date: 2015-09-04 15:14:58
Anyway, that's not the point. The point, which I hope I demonstrated, is that you are wrong about miners being absolute kings of Bitcoin who can dictate to everybody whatever they want.
The biggest value of the network is in users, their network effect and in companies that were built and had multi-million investments.
A few paranoid people who chase abstract decentralization just for the sake of it (whatever *it* is) are no match for that value.
@_date: 2015-09-05 11:32:55
That's way too abstract.
You basically postulating that "whatever the change EM has no say and will always submit". That's obviously not true and depends on the change.
Without the context of a particular change it doesn't make any sense to try and analyse what EM would do.
I hopefully showed you that *if* EM decides to split, they have the means to do it and motivation not to support the old coin. And *if* they split, they will be in a better position. This possibility alone puts some constraints on miners' decisions.
So to summarize, I see no point in arguing about spherical EM vs spherical MM in the context of a spherical proposed change :)
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:03:36
There is a world outside Bitcoin. The fact that you all wrote code for Bitcoin doesn't make you any special or give you any special powers.
You all are just a random bunch of open-source contributors, no better or worse. Many of you are just man-children who don't have much professional experience. The community has listened to you and it's gotten into your head.
You also drove a lot of people away from Bitcoin development, again, due to your nasty personalities of immature kids.
And now you proclaim that you are somehow THE technical community, and that only THAT technical community is able to decide what's best for Bitcoin?!
Again, it's like a bunch of programmers, who wrote some java system for a bank, would go to the board of directors and demand to run a bank.
You wrote some code. Good, have a cookie.
It's our money in the system now, so you have absolutely no rights to tell us how to use it.
@_date: 2015-09-17 06:12:56
Well, then what's the reason to mine together if you don't share the workload? You could mine alone instead.
Ah, wait, I figured it out :) Cool concept. It's like a risk sharing scheme. TIL.
@_date: 2015-09-12 18:06:23
Wow, nice idea and cool that you accept Bitcoins!
It's a perfect way to have a face on your avatar and still not reveal your identity.

This is a backward thinking: they will not embrace the rebels, they **ARE** the rebels.
And the reason is very simple: they want more mature and commercially oriented coin, like XT: bigger blocks, more agile development.
@_date: 2015-09-05 10:41:14


This is the most ridiculous claim from you so far. You have some perverted understanding of Bitcoin ecosystem.
Go to the XT site, check the Who's On Board section and see what each company does, how big it is, how useful it is.
Without BitPay, the leader in accepting Bitcoin payments, you will instantly lose thousands of merchants, who won't even notice anything. They will automatically be switched to the new coin, unless they manually opt-out.
Without Blockchain.info you will instantly loose thousands of users, for whom Bitcoin = Blockchain.info wallet, and they have about 4 million wallets.
That's just the two of the "worthless startups" you are talking about.
It's not a matter of "control". It's a matter of utility.
As I said, **25% of miners and 75% of businesses will beat the coin with 75% of miners and only 25% of businesses**.
If you argue with that particular statement, I think it's time to accept defeat :)
It doesn't get any clearer than that.
@_date: 2015-09-17 05:44:41
Aren't they all working on the same block? Which means it has the same version?
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:09:34
It's hard to determine the right user. Besides, the truly fair way would be to mirror the coinbase tx percentages and split the reward proportional to the shares, but then everybody would receive tiny meaningless dust, at least until donations increase. For now it's better to just send to a random user.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:48:04
I admire (and envy) your patience...
@_date: 2015-09-05 14:46:57
Ok, after reading all of your lengthy replies I think I pinpointed two issues of disagreement:
1) You analyse companies' decision to switch as black and white: 0.5 USD fee is not that big, hence it doesn't matter *at all*. That's a fallacy. A company can very well make decisions based on projected growth of 4% vs 2%.
2) You perceive the risk of losing 75% of miners as catastrophic and won't even try to estimate how bad it would actually be. Again, black and white.
The fact is that CPU-coin will not be immediately crushed:
a) It's not actually a CPU-coin, it will be a GPU-coin, which Bitcoin was not so long ago.
b) The absolute power is not very important here, i.e. we're not considering cases like "NSA building a GPU datacenter in Utah specifically to ruin Bitcoin". It just have to be practical that you won't be able to find enough colluding people with GPU's.
Mining power is not sacred. It's not black and white and ASIC's power can be trivially invalidated by a simple algorithm change.
It's not a magical substance absolutely required to run a successful coin. (Yes Bitcoin is successful and it has the largest hashing power, but correlation doesn't imply causation).
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:56:13
No argument about network effect. Of course, for the split to happen the situation must be dire enough for the companies to switch in bulk. But that's not impossible, judging by the current blocksize situation. We don't have that many companies too.
In case of 75/25 ASIC split - does orphaning blocks means they have to stop mining their own coin? This also doesn't include the possibility that the price of 75% version will plummet and so miners will be way better off mining on the 25% side, rather than trying to kill it (because what, ideology?).
10,000 people with GPUs is more than enough. This means you will need to find 10,001 people and convince them to attack Bitcoin, instead of joining it (again, NSA with a datacenter full of 10,000 GPU's is not a concern here).
So to summarize, my 2 points are:
1) The split is not that unimaginable as you think. It's quite imaginable and can be analysed with sober cost/benefit estimations.
2) In case the majority of companies *does* split, the consequences will be catastrophic, but not for them. And to avoid such consequences, miners will follow (assuming they are still compatible), instead of attacking it.
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:21:03


And this means you have the ultimate right to dictate to everybody else? Because you wrote some code?
Interesting argument. I think programmers who wrote some java system for a bank should go straight to the board of directors and demand to run the bank from now on.
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:53:54
Haven't you just answered your own question? :)
Besides, there are other businesses beyond exchanges. And a practical reason for them not to support both coins is the need to modify existing infrastructure. Another practical reason is to avoid confusing their users.
So if blockchain.info decides to go with the new coin, it will be a big hit to the old coin's value. If BitPay decides to go with only the new coin... well, you get the picture :)
