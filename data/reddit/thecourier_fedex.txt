I get it, but I inferred you were trying to spin the article into saying Bitcoin won't fail, when it states it will in the end.

Whoa, I do have chase. Why is that a problem, please explain!
Edit: I see, after a google search.

Can you get them to tweet for the official sac kings twitter (verified) or something?
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:26:21
Doesn't the article still state it will fail as a currency either way?

Well my "investment" in btc is with play money. I'd rather not lose it all, I'm fine taking up to a 70% loss, but I didn't want to dip into my savings or summer Disney world money for this weekend. I'd the price is low, and I still believe in btc in a few weeks, I should have some more play money by then.

This shit right here is why people don't take Bitcoin seriously.

So which "bottom" are we at? 3rd 4th? 800, 600, 500, 450... Now sub 400!!

Where are your calculations for $350 or are you just pulling numbers out of thin air?
Edit: spelling

Shouldn't that increase price? If you have 5 people for 1 item, the price is suppose to go up

Why? I'm not financially savvy. Isn't this good news?

I recommend putting the survey in a non Bitcoin subreddit as well, since your responses here will be heavily biased.

If you're banking on user growth, one of the things this subreddit says is needed, then a decline in interest by the public should worry you.

Do you know what you're saying or are you farting on your keyboard and letting the air pressure type random words?

I hope so, just sold 15 coins, have 6 more. Needed to cash for next weekend/this weekend. Would like those last 6 to cover my losses on those 15.
