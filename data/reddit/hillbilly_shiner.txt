Thanks but not quite what I'm looking for.  Cryptothrift.com is a thrift type store where people post their items to sell at discounted rates and people buy the items using BTC &amp; LTC (Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin).  I know there has to be more online stores like this, I'm just having a hard time locating them.  Again, thank you for your a

On cryptothrift I buy $100 Starbucks for $25 - $30 each then I'm able to resale to some people around here for a small profit.  People also sell other cards they have there as well as other things, kind of like EBay for btc.  Lately though most of the people selling have left the site so I'm looking for more sites like this so I figured Riddit would be a good place to ask since my other efforts have turned up nothing.  Thanks for your help &amp; I hope this explanation helped &amp; you can always go to  to check out the site.  I got Windows 8.1 Pro Key from the site for $5 &amp; AMC movie tickets gold &amp; silver packages cheap too.

All btc is put into an escrow by the site and is then released once payment is made to help prevent scams.  He doesn't have to do anything really, just a nice safety net by the site.

If you go to localbitcoins.com and fill out the buy btc page there is an option to buy local, in person with cash giving you names of people willing to meet in a public place to do btc trades.  They also have other options for ways to buy &amp; sell btc and the site uses escrow when performing trades.  I wish y'all the best of luck &amp; happy btcing.
