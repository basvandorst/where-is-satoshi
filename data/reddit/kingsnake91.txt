Or if you have enough invested in crypto, buy two hardware wallets. Write down the seed of your new ledger, put your crypto on it, and then put that seed in your second ledger. If it works, your seed is written correctly. If it doesn't work, view the seed on your original ledger again and spot the mistake. It's always good to have a backup that you keep elsewhere. It is also convenient to have two ledgers if you have coins in most of the wallets that ledger supports. The ledger only has enough memory to keep 5 or 6 wallets on it, so you can put some wallets on one and some wallets on the other.

Same way you buy is the same way you sell.

As much as you want.
Set up a wallet (sidebar of this subreddit) and then once you buy on Coinbase/GDAX you should transfer them to this wallet. Never keep your Bitcoin on an exchange. Then when you want to sell, you will transfer them back to Coinbase/GDAX and sell.

Markets are random and impossible to time. Buy in small chunks over the next couple days/weeks to protect yourself from a drop within that time frame.

Question. My main holdings are BTC, ETH, XMR, LTC, and NEO. Can I keep all of these on my one ledger?

Sounds like bad decisions.

You can easily just take off one or two of the wallets that you don't access much to make room for your others. Then just switch back when you need to access these wallets. Or yes you could get two.

No? It's approaching a very big resistance and it will take a while to cross this hump.

I'd say that age 15 is the optimal time to get into the riskiest investment in modern history. Much better for someone his/her age to invest than for a 60 year old right before retirement.

Go with Coinbase/GDAX.

Tough question. Lol. Try impossible question. More like pointless question.
