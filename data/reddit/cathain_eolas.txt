Yup, my buddy in China says everyone uses it. Beats having to carry around a stack of Yuan whenever you want to buy something.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:26:26
I just don't think it's the solution. Bitcoin is already losing a lot of merchants or possibilities due to the volatile fees. Something needs to be done yesterday to solve it without having to rush out LN like they're doing now.
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:16:07
Lol no
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:05:35
Who determines whether it was fraud or not?

Is the final Commitment transaction signed on or off the block chain though?
It seems like there's a possibile way to spoof commitment transactions.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:58:19
Via a Finney attack.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:10:29
Terrible graph. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:56:39
For 0-confs it does
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:38:18
There is lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:36:40
That's a terrible analogy.

You keep posting this and I read and watched it. Interesting story, but I don't know what to believe anymore. 
Even if he is Satoshi as the evidence suggests, it shouldn't matter anymore. It also serves as proof that if anyone ever did come out as Satoshi, their whole life is going to be picked apart and they'll be surprised to find he isn't some brilliant polymath, but someone with a great idea that took a whole community to get it bootstrapped.

Increasing the block size.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:59:09
Trying to double spend a micro transaction isn't worth the effort. It would have a very low success rate. 
And no merchant that is selling valuable goods is going to release the goods before 3-6 confs
Edit: Well now it's a little easier because of RBF
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:21:24
Ok. And there's no way that state can be altered on the LN due to latency? What secures the states if there's no proof of work?
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:56:24
Yeah but they're not accepting bitcoin, only verge
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:05:11
So centralized?
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:17:09
Ok that makes sense. Thanks! 
Seems like an overly complex way to avoid micropayments.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:27:13
I don't know if I'd consider about 15 btc huge.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:02:47
Cause they saw the unreliable fee variance in December and a lot of btc devs consider micropayments as "spam" on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:10:15
Also 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon doesn't apply to routes that can go offline at any time.

The first alt coin was not Litecoin. It was Namecoin, then a lot of other failed premined coins before Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:03:44
Not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:07:24
Look anywhere and it will say Namecoin was the first altcoin. It's not hard to copy the bitcoin code and spend months premining it. Namecoin at least brought something different. And Litecoin didn't matter up until they got Segwit. It pumped before the rumors of getting on Mt Gox. Then it stayed at $4-$6 dollars until getting Segwit and on Coinbase.
It brought nothing to the table and still is just a test chain for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:36:44
I'm talking about the LN, what is preventing someone from finding a way to spoof the state to make it look like it came later?
What would a higher nonce have to do with it? That's just the number of times a sha256 algorithm is ran. Doesn't mean it's more correct. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:06:18
Sounds like a lot of trust is needed for what is supposed to be a trustless system
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:22:27
Freicoin was premined and the client wasn't available until 2012. 
Namecoin came out in April 2011 and the idea came from discussions with Satoshi and was codenamed bitDNS. They decided it'd be better to use a separate blockchain instead of Bitcoin. Still an interesting usecase, but just resulted in a bunch of squatters trying to buy names in hope their value would increase.
Litecoin came out Oct 2011 and the only reason it took off was because it was claimed to be GPU resistant and Charlie's marketing as Silver to Bitcoin gold (He admits this in multiple interviews). But we've all learned ASIC resistance is not real unless you continually change the cryptography. 
There were plenty of other premined scam altcoins between Namecoin and Litecoin, ixcoin comes to mind.

Plus, you were the one that said I was wrong lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:07:44
I don't think they want to wait the 2+ years until a final release when they can easily find a working alternative
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:32:03
Having multiple nodes doesn't matter if there's no currency. If there's no btc on each side of the channel, the probability of finding a successful route decreases. 
I don't think LN is a solution. Bitcoin worked just fine with micro transactions years ago. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:34:54
Lol. "If you don't understand it then you must be a shill" 
LN is not simple. Otherwise it wouldn't take years to develop.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:16:13
Bitcoin can't handle the volume either. That's why the mempool was flooded in December.
It's basically a better version of Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:25:40
What secures the states if there's no proof of work? Are they stored somewhere? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:09:03
I was paraphrasing you.
"Really, the only time you'd encounter problems with an answer like this is if the question-asker has an ulterior motive or agenda, and is actually trying to shill an altcoin."
