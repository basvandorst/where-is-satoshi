One common issue that I see newcomers having (myself included) is actually buying bitcoins since it takes so long for funds to transfer and to get verification. Do you see there being any changes to this or do you have any recommendations on a quicker way to purchase BTC (Other than LocalBitcoin) I live in the middle of nowhere so that isn't really an option for me. Thanks.

Well I don't have a wallet currently because I do not have a personal computer (I'm on my work computer) but I did transfer like $.50 to my coinbase from my bitcointip wallet really easily.

I too would like answers to these questions. Also what is a request? I under stand send is a way to send bitcoins to someone else. But is a request just asking for money or must a request be issued before someone can send bitcoins?

I've tried switching browsers and that didn't resolve it. Maybe try again once I get home. Glad to know I'm not the only one though.

Is anyone else not able to verify their identity because the drop down boxes for country/state are blank?

I too did this exact thing and bought my fraction yesterday morning right before coinbase buying went down. The advice I got was that CoinBase is fine as a checking account but that it would be in your best interests to get a wallet to act as your savings account. In other words don't keep a lot of money in coinbase.

Nah. The way that it is converted to USD is you sell it to someone else. So it is not removed. Just transferred to the buyers wallet.

I would look into Coinbase for merchants if you are wanting something user friendly.

I think this one is out. It says invalid code.
