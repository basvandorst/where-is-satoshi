That was a dark day in bitcoin history

But coinbase is fdic insuranced and has there crypto insured form everything too.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:08:33
And physical security. It has it all insuranced. And the likeyhood of coinbase being hacked and falling is almost zero. Do if it does happen bitcoin will love mostly dead anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:03
Oh those are orders that people put out there and hope that someone would fill it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:35:21
Looked them up. I could not find them being insuranced by anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:39:18
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
I live in America. I think you should email them about this.

Think about this reasonably let's say they have a million Bitcoin (probably the high end). If they only hold 2% of there Bitcoin in hot wallets that is about 20,000btc (the upper range). They charge 1.5% in fees. They have assets of there own that they can cover the hack by themselves right? Then let's say they get hacked completely like all the Bitcoin they have. Well they have insurance on it. So we are in this situation where the safest place is on your coinbase when something goes bad they at least have the backup and insurnce.

Dude I did the same thing. But I bought it at .86 cents intially. I was about 13 when I learned about Bitcoin. By the time I was 14 my parents allowed me to buy it. So I took 50 percentage of what I had at the end of the month and bought Bitcoin, Litecoin, Doge, and Ron Paul coin and whatever currency I found about. And have kept doing. The irs is probably going to be at my door the moment I sell any.

Well that is the orders that have completed. And the process. It does how much and how many bitcoins have sold. It also shows how the market has moved. Has it gone up or down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:29
Coinbase is insuranced from hacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:08
Someone in the twitter tweets to them today said that BCH would skyrocket. So that why they arent taking any btc, or ltc today.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:32:37
It said it is insured. Never says only 2% is only insured. And also tell me a good platform that has a business charter from every state? None.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:47
Yeah. Hopefully you make some money today.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:25:37
Well you can get a trail. Like how you got the btc-e coins.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:52:16
Is there USD fdic insurancered?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:13:44
Tell me another platform that is this secure and so versatile to use.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:53:25
That's good. I never understood the struggle of getting verified there because I was verified there since 2013. And then I tried to help a neighbor out because he was trying to use kracken, he could not get verified and coinbase suport is horrible.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:35
I can't even sell my Bitcoin. It is on a fucking paper wallet in a safe. I am so bailing off this ship. (Only 2 btc. Not all mine).
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:52
Yup. Have fun trade safe.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:02
But does it matter? If you got a few million by doing it. Wouldn't you take that risk and manipulate the market?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:15:03
Kraken sucks. I had accounts on several exchanges but kraken could not verify my identity for weeks on end. I wrote them an angry email and still nothing. When I finally got it up and running the exchange sucked.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:27:58
Tell me another exchange that has full insurance on what is in your account if they go down.
Edit: Cobinhood does not have insurance. The reason I am with coinbase is they are fully insured from acts of god, hacks, internal and external. And there USD wallet is fdic insured. So find me something that can replace it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:14
What platform? Can you provide more info?
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:22:04
That is a good idea.

@_date: 2017-11-10 04:41:04
Dude change your account password rn. And make it some time that you never said or thought about. And enable all the 2 factors.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:55:46
I have the same issue except the market says 40% up hell yeah! The I hold out and now I have way to much in bitcoin.
