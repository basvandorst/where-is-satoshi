Glad to hear I'm not a total anomaly at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:31:48
Thank you for the info!  Although I definitely received no email...

I can't wait for a correction.  I've put most of what I'm willing to invest in already, but I have some stored for jumping in after a huge profit take.  If that never happens, it's ok, I still have most of what I want already in there doing work and growing.

I hope so.  I want to buy a massssive dip, not this ~$4000 stuff.  Let's dip all the way back to sub $3k (or lower) before we get to $5k

Well with some of my BCC I was able to exchange it for BTC on HitBTC.  I haven't withdrawn in back to my wallet though yet.

I missed that dip by 12 hours because my funds were in limbo to  GDAX (Sent like 3 days before the dip...).  I putzed around for 2 days hoping we'd see another one.  Now with it starting to soar i just hopped in.  Don't wanna be that skeleton meme when this thing hits 5000

gdax is really cheap (which is funny because GDAX is coinbase...), but you can't do instant bank transfers.  If you set up a maker order (instead of just doing a market order), then the fee is 0%.  Gemini is also great, it allows instant bank transfers (that then it holds your coins hostage until it actually receives the money, but that's fine if you're not in a huge rush to withdraw).  The problem with them is the $500 max deposit.  Both require a little more planning than Coinbase, but worth it if you can plan ahead.

I avoid Coinbase now because of the fees (1.5% on a whole coin comes out to a significant chunk of change), but I do kind of wish I had sucked it up when it dropped to $3750.  Crossing my fingers for that again.  
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:31:36
It is completely possible for it to dip like that again.  There's still FUD about all this 2X and BCH stuff.  I have my limit order ready to buy a dip like the one we saw a few days ago (took awhile to get money into GDAX -_- )

Question related to this that someone wiser might be able to answer.
I goofed trying to send coin from HitBTC to Bittrex, and instead of using the bittrex deposit address, I used the HitBTC address (from the account the coins were already in).  This transaction is currently pending on HitBTC, I'm just worried this will screw things up.  I'm not too broken up about not getting to time things well, I just want to make sure I didn't screw up and lose my coin.

Maybe check out cointracking?  It's a website, so not super privacy friendly, but I don't care too much about that. As long as I'm secure, I don't care what a random website knows. It does almost everything I want. I was keeping a spreadsheet myself, but it was kind of daunting and since I was logging a bunch of old transactions, things we're getting slightly off. Cointracking can do most of it by simple exchange imports, and then you can add transfers to wallet and all that too. I honestly don't know a ton myself, this just happens to be the best thing I've found. Interested if others have found something superior.

Yeah, people like me who had a big chunk in the vault got screwed by this.  Yes I should have been more on top of it, but forgot the vault had such a long delay.  I'm left with hoping hat either BCC drops to near zero almost immediately, or that it becomes so successful that Coinbase decides to support it, in which case it sounds like people who left coins on coinbase will get their equivalent BCC.  Not holding my breath for the latter at all though.

Gemini has much lower fees.  The only reason I can see to use Coinbase is that they are slightly more newbie-friendly, but it really isn't hard to use Gemini.  their fees are 0.25% vs. Coinbase 1.5% over $200 (higher fee % if you're buying less).
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:16:13
The day that happens, this sub will explode.
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:58:40
Used one around 58th and 1st in a bodega. It was simple to use as long as you have your mobile wallet handy. I forget what the fee was though.

As always, but as they say, best time to grow a tree yatta yatta.  Glad you like the resource, I do too!
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:07:28
yup.  I've been hodling for a good while, I was just rediversifying my portfolio to give crypto a bigger percentage, wanted it at 3800, but I have faith we'll be over 5k before too long, so happy to get the new amount in here.

Use Electrum instead of Circle. Use Gemini as an exchange for lower fees. Slightly more confusing user interface than coinbase, but nothing too weird. Good luck. You're young, just pretend you're throwing that money away, and hold it for over a decade. Come back to Megabucks. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:47:18
Out of curiosity why do you say Gemini is better?
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:20:59
How successful would it have to be for coinbase to change their minds and support it?

If you had a key to a treasure chest full of gold, and the treasure chest had a perfect lock that could only ever be opened by that key, do you have the gold stored on your person?  If you lost that key, you lose your gold, but I don't really think that would count as storing the gold on you...
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:50:42
I don't think this will work if your coinbase vault BTC are currently "in the void" being transferred to your coinbase wallet.  
Sucks :(
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:23:29
Ah well, here's hoping that the fork is delayed and or BCH immediately crashes to 0...
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:56:18
Is there any solid answer to this?
