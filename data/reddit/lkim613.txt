Best advice would be to do some research on the tech and form your own opinion. Whatever the reason for you buying in, make sure you only spend what you are willing to lose. Also, if you are worried about the dip going further, you can dollar cost average over a few days. Lastly, verify your ID with coinbase and sign up with gdax (partner exchange with coinbase). Coinbase has a $200 buy limit (eventually will increase) once your ID is verified so I would also look into other exchanges, such as kraken.

Look into mining different alts and then switch them to btc after you have enough. It may not even be worth it then.

This was very well thought out, I saw this a few days ago as a comment on a separate post. I'm glad you made it into its own post. There are a lot of people that seem to think investors will continue to sell their bitcoin to drive the price down lower.
What most people aren't taking into consideration is the loss that these entities would be taking on btc price. The futures opened on the 10th and 18th of december and back then the price of btc was around 16-18k. Selling btc now would result in a 30% or more loss on initial investment based on purchase date of the btc. That's a 30% loss on 15mil worth of btc (-$4.5mil) to drive the price down by 1k and effectively net 5mil from the futures, or after losses 500k. As the price goes lower, it continues to cut into the profit from the short position. imo doesn't seem worth it, even with FUD kicking in, and the price dropping an additional 1k or so.
It seems more likely that investors would roll forward and wait for the price to rise again so they aren't taking a loss on the btc investment. It will be interesting to see over the coming months if this will be a new norm for the bitcoin community or whether wall street will start supporting bitcoin a bit more via long positions.

There is a great post on the front page right now regarding tomorrow's futures expiration. Here's the link: 
If it falls at all, I could see a drop of around 5-10%, and if the FUD picks up maybe a little bit further. It seems like the market has settled in anticipation for tomorrow. I do think that from afterwards there will be an increase in price again.

Stop by at and check it out. What province are you in. Canada needs more hodlers. We are also in the middle of a correction atm, so if you are waiting for it to go lower, maybe think about dollar cost averaging your total purchase power over a few days or weeks. I've bought smaller amounts a few times over the past few days as it was hitting major price points, and a larger amount when it dropped to 9k. Have fun and welcome to the show.

I feel like the best advice to give is to only put in what you are willing to lose. Whatever amount that is, that's for you to decide. If you feel comfortable losing 9k, then that's your prerogative. If not, find an amount that sits well with you.
I recommend getting a paper wallet, and if you feel it necessary (once again, based on your comfort) a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are definitely the most secure, but as long as your bitcoin is not sitting on an exchange you will be okay.
Find a good exchange that is compatible where you live (coinbase/gdax for the USA, quadrigax for Canada, etc)
Lastly, I would recommend dollar cost averaging your money. So instead of investing all at once. Do a smaller amount every week or two weeks. This way if the price drops in a week, you will have money to buyin to the lower price. If it raises, you would still be investing the money anyways. (and the "lost profit" will mean nothing in 2+years when the price has gone up another %2000)
There will always be people that say it is going to crash, or the bubble will burst. People said it when it first came out, said it when it hit 500, etc. No one really knows what will happen with it.

Let's go through the article then... It talks about twitters CEO declaring that bitcoin will be most significant currency in the world. But then mentions the crypto ad ban on twitter, seemingly spreading FUD. Next it mentions a financial times article. Which if you read the actual article, is very biased and one sided, and has much of the same theoretical “bitcoin will use too much power and end the world” literature.
Then, the article moves on to talk about narrow money... Which is questionable. Narrow money is any money or liquid asset that is owned by the central bank. This is a very slippery one. The article is pretty much stating that all of the bitcoin that people own is actually owned by the central bank. Curious. To my knowledge this is false. But hey, I'm not an expert. The math that goes into the $10M per coin is stating that by 2028 ALL of the narrow money in the entire world will be in bitcoin. ($210T divided by 21M bitcoins =$10M per coin. I mean I'm all for mass adoption, but with the state we are in currently, I find it very far fetched to see bitcoin becoming the only currency used in only 10 years. As bitcoin is often compared to gold, lets use the market cap of $7.8T. Which would put bitcoin at $370K per coin (thats 58 times the current market cap).
The halving is inaccurately represented. Current block reward being 12.5, with a halving every 4 years (one in 2020, 2024, and then again in 2028) would make the block reward in 2028 1.5625 btc. This goes to show the lack of understanding and/or research from the writer. After this point, all of the math is off due to the above two issues (bitcoins price in the year 2028 based on narrow money, and the halving being wrong)
The article also uses the digiconomist to quote a few different points regarding the cost per transaction, and the operational costs (math is off due to the above points I have made) Take a look at the digiconomist, which is also very biased and only shows one side of the story. While I was on the site, I noticed a stat that was tucked away. Bitcoin's electricity consumption as a pecentage of the world's electricity consumption: 0.26%. Not very high when you think about it.
So I do apologize for calling the article names. However, it is hard to see any value in the article. I think that it is also naive to say that block difficulty is irrelevant here. Lower block difficulty=less hashing power needed to mine a block=less electricity needed to mine a block. If the hashing power is lower in 2028 than it is now, the whole article is irrelevant.
I'll explain this more thoroughly. If the cost of mining out ways the profitability, then people will stop mining. This will drop the hashing power, and in turn drop the difficulty, which will then drop the amount of electricity that is needed to mine each block. Now, you are saying that if someone is making $10M per bitcoin, why would they not mine, in turn creating more hashing power, and using more electricity. But the answer is above. As someone dumps more hashing power into the system, the difficulty will go up, and other miners will not be able to compete and will stop mining. As they stop mining, the hashing power will decrease, etc. Etc. Etc. As I said, this will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. In fact, this was just talked about in detail. Back in February, when the price was approaching $4-5K. At the current difficulty, mining bitcoin was slowly becoming less and less profitable. If a certain price was breached, there would have been a massive reduction in miners, because it would not have been as profitable. This in turn would have lowered the hashing power. The same thing applies on the way up, however the space becomes a lot more competitive.
As I said in my last comment, I am not an expert. I am sure someone else can come along and use more technical terms and further answer your question. I am also sure that this is not the only or final solution. There is a team working on bitcoin currently, finding solutions for problems such as electricity consumption. Maybe we will see a fork over the next couple of years with an increase in block size. Who knows. Another way I could see this being “fixed” is government regulations in the form of each household is only allowed a specific amount of electricity to be used towards bitcoin mining. However, this would obviously present its own set of problems.
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:21:08
No, I’m pretty skeptical that bitcoins price would drop to $100. Currently, it costs around $11M (1400 btc) to drop or raise the price by $1000. If the price of a single bitcoin was $100, it would only take $140,000 to accomplish the same thing. The current size of the industry would swallow the drop up. You would see a lot of money swarm in really fast and buy the cheap coins, effectively skyrocketing the price.
If the price were to hit $100, let alone $1000, there would be a lot of aggressive buyers. Right now, $100 gets you 1% of a Bitcoin. Just think about that. There might be a lot of scared “investors” who bought in to make a quick buck. But the people who believe in the tech would go nuts, and further their holding.
Personally, I would love to see that, as I am in this long term, and would buy a lot. But I know it’s very unrealistic. Seeing the price close to $1000 would even cause a buying frenzy for a lot of people.

The article is written by someone who has very little understanding of how the system works. That, or they are printing pure FUD. Either way, the answer is no. The amount of electricity that it takes to mine is not a set variable. Therefore we will not have power consumption issues.
I am certainly no expert, but this is how I see it. Right now the energy consumption is on the "high" side. But as the cost of mining increases (via equipment cost, energy cost, etc) the amount of miners will decrease. (Example: From where I am from a kilowatt hour costs $0.11 non-peak and $0.15 in peak times, it is not as profitable for me to mine as say someone who has free electricity) With the decrease in miners, and effective hash power being contributed towards mining, the difficulty will decrease, and in turn the amount of electricity that it takes to mine a block. The same can happen, but instead of it being the cost of power, it can be the actual difficulty getting too hard for some mining setups.
This will be a constant part of the evolution of bitcoin. Regardless of the price of a single coin. On top of that, you need to take into consideration the halvening. Every four years the reward of mining a block gets halved. So yes, the price of a single bitcoin may go up, but the reward will continue to go down.

Bitcoin has a market cap 7 times larger than bcash. A lot of work would have to be put in for bcash to ever surpass btc. Bcash would have to grow by 700% to even be equal to btc right now.
 Also, bitcoin is in the process of consolidation right now. 8.3-8.6K is becoming the new bottom with a lot of support around those areas. It will be a while before it takes off again, but give it a few more weeks. I could see the end of Feb or beginning of March starting a strong bull run.
Lastly, there are a lot of day traders that are currently buying in @ 8.3k and selling around 8.6K. Making a ~10% profit each time, which drives the price down each time they sell.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:57:34
A sell wall of 200 btc is nothing to worry about. Bears are slowing down overall, and the main resistance is the sell walls, which often get pulled. We might see some people take profits, which will offer small plateaus or drops. But the market seems to be in a mainly positive position atm.

@_date: 2018-02-04 07:49:04
I bought in late November when it was around 12k. I watched it rise, and then tank to where it is now, buying more as it got lower. Yeah it hurts to see the worth of my btc less than what it started at, but I'm alright for two reasons. A) I believe in the technology, and the goal of bitcoin and blockchain as a whole, and B) I put in an amount that I wasn't worried about loosing. If bitcoin hit 0 tomorrow, I would be okay. If A isn't resonating with you, read up on the technology or watch some of Andreas Antonopoulos' videos. If B isn't resonating with you, pull out an amount of money that makes you sleep better at night.
In terms of overall morale, yeah it is probably pretty low right now. I have a few friends who had bought in around the same time as me. While I was buying the dips, they were selling. What I'm sure we'll see is when/if the price starts returning to normal, there will yet again be a rally with the general public (already the 24h volume on gdax is up again from last weeks lows of 10k). The next two months will be rough, but as the price goes back up people will "regret" not buying in when it was cheaper. We'll start to see stories such as "I bought in when it was $x and then sold when it dipped, damn". This crash will definitely leave a sour taste in a lot of peoples mouths. But I think you have to ask yourself "why did I buy in when I did? What made me want to buy in? Will people again feel the same way I felt about bitcoin when i bought in?"
There's nothing wrong with your "hair dresser" talking about bitcoin. Public adoption is a good thing and will help the price rise. You bought in at an unfortunate time, and it looks bad on paper. But dips are a part of this as well, it's not just about making a 100% profit every month. If you feel like you are in too deep and your exposure is blown out of proportion, sell a bit of your position. The opposite is also true if you feel like you could grow your position. At the end of the day, in 10-20 years from now bitcoin will either have mooned, or will be stagnant/worth nothing. Not one single person alive knows the future. But I know that whatever happens, I want to be a part of the journey. Hodlgang.

My point is that there is a way to stop coins from being lost. Whether through a will or other means, there is already a solution. The lack of forethought, or planning, is not bitcoins fault.

I don't see institutional banks adopting btc. We don't want them to though. What's the point of bitcoin if the institutions remain in control and continue to inflate fiat. They could create their own crypto but who would buy it? One of the reasons btc is around is to put the power of money back into the individuals hands. I feel like you have read into the FUD a lot.
Yes, the market is down currently. But historically there has always been a low time at the beginning of the year. Give it until June; see what happens. Meanwhile, spend some time reading up on the actual technology. Follow the roadmap, a lot of exciting things are coming up. Listen to some Andreas Antonopoulis youtube videos. It's not just about making a quick buck.
edit: I'm from Canada, and the general morale is pretty low. The Big5 banks are banning crypto purchases, but this will fuel the fire. I'm still bullish long term.

As long as there is organization of assets prior to a death, nothing would be lost. Similar to if someone has put money somewhere, there should be documentation in a will, that way the family members and beneficiary have knowledge of it. The lack of organization of an individual is not bitcoin's fault.
I would expect as bitcoin grows, that there would be an overall movement to not only protect your keys but to make sure that they are accessible in a case such as death. The number of lost coins will gradually come to a stop as people are more wary of cases such as this.
Through this theoretical loss, there would be an increased rarity to the asset. I would not see this deflating the price.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:19:31
lol theoretically, if the price of bitcoin went back to the ATH of 19k a coin, that would be a percentage increase of 175%. 175% of $50 is $87.5. So you would now have a total of $137.50. No one knows what the price of bitcoin will look like though, it could go higher than that... Or it could go lower than what it is currently.
But, in short to answer your question. You can figure out what your investment will be theoretically worth by looking at the percentage increase.

Look into other exchanges (a few others have mentioned kraken). Once you have found an exchange you like, create an account. You can then move crypto to your new account via coinbase (if you first move your crypto to gdax, you will be facing no transfer fees). I would also recommend finding a good wallet to use, as keeping your crypto on exchanges is not recommended.

Why would we see a short squeeze with the new shorts? Shorts make money based on lowering the price and reselling, they wouldn’t want to raise the price.
Bull traps don’t necessarily have to actually trap anyone... it’s a nickname for a trading pattern, the whipsaw... which was almost perfectly executed today at around noon. While there were long positions being closed, there were around 150mil worth of short positions being liquidated since Sunday, these two factors raised the price, and earlier today we saw the price action pick up as the bulls continued to buy and the short positions reopened and began another selloff. An almost picture perfect bull trap... short positions reopening means a decline in price as they selloff the btc, the long positions will probably continue to decline as the sentiment behind the market continues to dwindle. The short positions have 40k btc behind them, they could drop the price below 2500 if they wanted to.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:17:36
Lol +$200 mill worth of btc shorts just opened. Shorts only make money if the price drops. There’s not enough long capital to sustain a rally against the shorts.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:50:28
This uptrend was purely short positions closing and then reopening. Since Sunday there were +$200mil worth of shorts that closed, most reopened yesterday. There was another short close today that caused another price raise, they’re still waiting to see if any bulls raise the price further before they reopen their position. BCH has nothing to do BTC price. BCH is in the middle of a classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:14:38
You’re right, I was wrong. We’re still majorly in a bull trap though. Since Sunday, bitfinex has seen 150 mil worth of short positions liquidated, and very few long positions opened. Major players are making a lot of money, and well most likely see it fall again.
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:48:39
If you look at the depth chart of an exchange, you can determine how many coins/purchase power are/is needed to aprox. Reach a price target. Typically it takes about 8-12mil to increase the price by $1000. It’s not perfect math, but it gives you an idea. You are getting the total market cap increase by multiplying the price increase of 6k by total coins. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:37:27
Where are you getting this $2.25 billion from? And why do you think they lost anything? Honestly, the rise in price could have been short positions closing, and stocking up again for another round of shorting. Just looking at the charts, the last time there was a true close on the short positions was Dec. 7-9th. So we were due for a price jump. If someone shorted btc at 3550 selling off 1000 coins, and sold at 3150 buying those coins back, they would have made 400k in profit.
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:26:14
Yeah 300k is nothing, but 12 mil could move price by at least $200, maybe $400 depending on the depth, which is wide open for buying currently ... Followed by bulls who think that the price is making a breakthrough... Literally a text book bull trap. Price has bounced off the 3580 support three times now, too much selling power for it to move further up. Reason I posted in the first place was to explain to the OP that the short positions probably contributed to the raise by closing positions, and were probably not dumb enough to open a short at 3200-3150 as the risk would be very large. Also, OP was talking about a potential rally... Once again doesn't seem likely based on the 3580 support (a relatively small support of only \~300 coins) holding up on three separate occasions.
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:55:36
Looking at the liquidations, there were short positions liquidated on the 17th at roughly the time the price spiked (some 300k, followed by 12mil later in the day)

For bitcoin to be used as an actual currency we would need to be able to spend it similarly to fiat currency. If btc was worth 1mil, 1 satoshi would be worth 1 cent. At 100mil per btc 1 satoshi would be worth 1 dollar. At 1mil the market cap would sit at 21 trillion, three times the size of the market cap of gold.

There may be a little bit of FUD, but Anyone who was scared would have sold earlier in the year. There may be a few miners who are bailing to offset losses, and a few who bought in at ~$1000-500 taking last minute profits. No, this is pretty text book market manipulation. A select few sold off to create the initial drop. At this point there have been short positions being opened and closed for the past two weeks, which is driving price down. The negative sentiment in this particular drop is the upcoming January blues, most know that the bear market is at least 3 months from being finished, but realistically closer to 6 months.
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:55:33
Going up 6k in price would cost aprox. 54mil. When you span that over a year, that's a total of 38 btc a day. So 38 bitcoins have to be purchased each day for a year to reach 10k. That is very easy in the grand scheme of things. Typically 24hr volume is inbetween 11-20k btc, cut that in half to account for the selloffs... Based on volume alone, we could easily reach 100k per coin within a year of exiting the bear market, let alone 500k-1mil. Just putting it into perspective. Bitcoin doesn't need massive hype to reach 10k. When you just look at the numbers, it makes sense.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:52:12

I'm not rationalizing... The only reason for the price movement ever, is buying vs. selling pressure. If there are more buyers than sellers the price will go up, and vice versa. I never said there was a bear trap. Since this dip started, the short positions have been making money by selling and buying back in at a cheaper price (for instance, if one sold 1000 btc at 3550 and bought back those 1000 coins at 3150, they would have profited 400k). We hit a new low, which only makes sense for the short positions to buy back in. I am saying it's a bull trap because the price bounced off 3580 twice, meaning that there is a strong sell support at 3580 (the short positions are selling aggressively at 3580). it just tested 3580 again and got rejected again. I agree that there needs to be a catalyst here to start a bull market, and there is no catalyst currently. In fact January is right around the corner, which historically is always a low period for crypto. I have been buying crypto all the way down this dip, and will buy all the way up, and continue to do so after. The reason for my post in the first place was to help explain what was going on to the OP.
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:09:11

A bull trap is a false signal indicating that a declining trend in a stock or index has reversed... Seems pretty text book to me. Price got rejected at 3580 three times now, meaning the sellers out way the buyers at that price. IF I was right about the short positions, would it not make sense for them to unload again. Anyone who sold at 3550, and bought at 3150 just made a lot of money... (400k profit if you sold and bought 1000 coins)

Yeah, crypto can move in unpredictable ways, so only time will tell what happens. I'm buying as well, so no I'm not overly bear biased.I've been averaging out over the past year, and will continue to do so if it sky rockets. I just honestly think we're not out of this bear market, and honestly think there is market manipulation through short sellers and big money.

I’m confused how the .com bubble has anything to do with what we’re talking about currently. The .com bubble was not this year. I’m simply giving the math behind a $6000 increase in price. There are positive signs coming in the form of potential sec approval for etfs. As well as the ever growing lightning network. The signs are there; there is still a very large network in place. Quite a different position than 2013-2015z Yes, it’s beneficial to be realistic, I would say you are on the negative side of things though. Which is fine. But you cannot deny the math.

The 10% jump in price was caused by short positions closing. We saw it happen on December 7-9th. Happening here again. Now we've entered into a bull trap, and we'll see another $400-600 price drop.

125mil worth of short positions were liquidated since Sunday. When the short positions have closed, they’ll start again and we’ll see another drop. I’m still bearish until mid 2019.... but I keep buying, slow and steady.

What is even going on in this TA? I would recommend cleaning up your graph, if you are specifically pointing out volume, you don't need most of those lines. You're pointing out that there was a surge in volume in November? I wouldn't say that it as bullish sign, that was the volume that caused the dip in the first place. Very confusing graph, with an even more confusing explanation.

There is already a wallet on the iPhone that people use to store their credit cards on, and use daily. You can always put a case on your phone and make sure you charge your phone every day.
Bitcoin storage can be explain as cold and hot storage. If you have a large amount that you would like to store for a while, you can put it in “cold” storage and put it away usually in a hardware wallet (the same way you would put meat away) if you are looking to purchase daily in smaller amounts you can keep it on a “hot” wallet or a more active wallet (usually on your phone)

Flaw with quantum computing and brute forcing your way into a wallet is that would completely break the security of bitcoin. Price would tank and the coins you now have from stealing are worth nothing. No one would want to do that, and would instead focus on mining. Plus the actual time commitment... you would be making less than if you were mining... it’s been theorized before.

Other way around... bitcoin was the first coin, so the market often follows bitcoin, as most coins are paired to btc and not usd. BCH is a hard fork of bitcoin, and is a pump and dump scheme spear headed by roger ver. What we’re seeing here (and often see when there is a rally) is Ver pumping the price of BCH to make sure the crypto world doesn’t forget about BCH. When the news outlets release articles of this rally the headlines will read “BCH up 50% !!!! Good investment buy now” Instead of “bitcoin finally breaks out of bear market and increase value by 20%” or that’s what Ver hopes.
