What makes Bitcoin's market cap different from gold's?

Mate, be fair. Look how far the signals have to travel from one side of his brain to the other. You'd experience latency  too if your brain was as big.

Can the fee estimator in Bitcoin Core be relied upon?

Set him free, Your Honour: he's not sitting behind a wheel.

The point of adding salt is to prevent rainbow tables from being used to crack an entire user list. To salt correctly is to use a different value for each account. Therefore you have to store the salt as well as the salted hash in the user table.

No. Computing hashes is expensive. A rainbow table is a computed list of hashes and corresponding plaintexts. Once you've generated this table then matching each hash with a plaintext is trivial. Using a different salt for each user means this approach doesn't work and each user has to be bruteforced individually, greatly increasing the time it would take.
Using the same salt for each user means an attacker would have to compute the rainbow table rather than download a prexisting one, but that's about it.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with that approach. It's the correct way to store passwords.

The salts (they're different for each account) are stored right there in the database dump, in the same field as the hash.

I feel happier that my salt is right there in the compromised database, because that means the passwords were salted correctly (even though a stronger hashing function would have been better). You have the confidence to mock your fellow developer, but don't have the understanding of hashing to back it up and are only flaunting your ignorance.

I don't know why you're telling me the salt is stored in the database; I said that already in this very thread. A salt that is unique for each user **does** serve its purpose regardless of whether it's known. A salt that is unique only to an application does not serve its purpose if it becomes known. More often that not when a database has been compromised, so has the entire application/server and your secret salt is no longer so secret. That's why the Mt Gox approach is the best practice.

Ah, so you're criticising an exchange without having understood how it functions (read its FAQ). Bitmarket does not hold Euros. They hold the seller's BTC in escrow and only release them once the buyer has paid the seller directly. Even with that protection in place it's possible for scams to take place (e.g. PayPal chargebacks). You can criticise this setup all you want, but as it stands trustworthiness does need to be established (as far as is possible).
