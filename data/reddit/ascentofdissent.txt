I own bitcoin, but everyone shouting $10k from the rooftops are the same ones who needed that stupid suicide thread a few weeks ago.
I hope it does, but I certainly don't expect it. The hopium in here is why no one takes this subreddit seriously.

Well at least now I understand why you are the way you are. You have broken so many fundamental rules of investing it's just sad. Bitcoin might as well be a religion to you at this point. I wish you the best, but I won't feel even the least bit sorry for you if you lose it all.

Better max out your credit cards on bitcoin then. Put up or shut up, otherwise you just sounds like someone who already has some, won't buy at the next ATH and desperately wants to be rich.

This is where western union actually using bitcoin could benefit everyone. Charge 1-2% off the top for btc transfers and conversion to local currency and boom their business changes instantly. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:55:41
Possible? Sure. "more likely than not?" no. Just, no.
If I had to guess I'd say a high of 2500-4500 this year MIGHT be attainable. I'd love to be wrong, but let's not berate people for lacking irrational exuberance. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:01:30
so should we all be using local wallets with USB backups? Is there every any reason to leave coins on coinbase or btc-e for anything other than trading?
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:32:00
We are not at the top until random friends/family/people start telling me how much they've made off of buying fractional bitcoin. 
We're not at the top until the news starts talking about how awesome it is instead of making fun of us. 
You can't be serious if you think the general public is buying bitcoin at this point.

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:01:08
Western Union should pick up support it for much lower fees than its current business model and try to be Netflix of the money transfer world. Deposit cash/checks and have recipient cash out in store for a fee or send to a wallet for a lower fee. They already have the international store fronts, it's a huge opportunity but they're dinos and it won't happen. Plenty of people are too dumb or scared to do it on their own. It's a huge market.

When you tell people they can save a large amount of money by doing something a little differently, they will accept some changes and inconveniences. Another large company with some international brick and mortar presence would have to adopt it, but once that was done and word spread, WU would have to adopt it or become the next Barnes and noble. It COULD, could, happen very quickly.

@_date: 2013-12-17 01:22:31
It just comes off as near-religious fervor, dude. Banks won the war on the people a century ago; they run the world. You can't win. Bitcoin is a cool idea that we all would like to use and make some money with but the smart people are just sitting around waiting for the inevitable effort to kill it. That effort will be successful and btc will go back to being good for SR and that's about it. Today is proof of that. A coordinated effort to make it illegal would destroy it overnight.

no way. 
I was trading the LTC/BTC ratio. It jumped from .011 to .05 in like 2 weeks. I saw the chart. Everything in my brain said SELL NOW GET OUT. But I got greedy. I got stuck in the story and idea of bitcoin. I got too attached. We even got a dead cat bounce back to 45 and I knew I should have gotten out there too. I could have tripled my bitcoin with the ONE play that I knew was smart and I got greedy. I said the same thing around gold parity with BTC, should have waited for the correction. Could have doubled there too. I saw it all coming but I got attached. Made the same rookie mistakes... it sucks. Im still way up considering Ive been in since it was cheaper than the april highs but it still hurts to know what the right move is and then groan when you didnt do it. I respect the people who trade the numbers properly.

Hey parks and recreation has been on the air for "a long time."
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:18:30
no way, not selling on a parabolic chart like that, at least SOME of your holdings, is def a rookie mistake. I bought at 4.25, watched it hit 48 and then start to fall on Thanksgiving and convinced myself that it was going to 60 instead of doing what I knew was smart. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:48:49
While I am unfortunately too emotionally attached to have really played this drop the way I should have, you shouldnt talk down to people who play the market to increase their holdings. Being smart could have doubled your bitcoin in a period of  two days. That doesn't mean you don't believe in the stuff long term, it just means your'e taking advantage of volatility for increasing your own bitcoin. I admire the people who got out on some telling TA and are getting back in on the bottom. They're smarter than I am.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:08:20
I was up with money ready to buy that dip and couldnt. So frustrating.... Bitcoin isn't ready for the big time without consistency.

You're not allowed to mention LTC in They all think it's going to hurt the value of their BTC and should be done away with. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:52:05
You may not feel this way, but to a lot of people, BTC folks simply seem concerned that Litecoin is just inflating the amount of coins on the market and thus shrinking BTC's value. It comes off as FU I GOT MINE even if that's not exactly what it is. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:52:05
sorry for the noob question, but who collects the transaction fees? The company selling the coins or facilitating the trades? what about between individuals? who gets those?

I never said otherwise, but if no one in America can get their USD into BTC quickly, consistently and easily, then we can't really go anywhere at any significant pace. The fact of the matter is, I had about a 10 minute window this morning that I wanted to buy in, but I couldnt. That makes me frustrated and I am not alone in that frustration.

No the problem was that I didn't keep a 10% trailing stop on a 1000% increase... No stops at all is a rookie mistake - it's not just confirmation bias. That is part of it tho.

Sure and they are: 
1. pay an enormous premium and meet a stranger locally in a damned starbucks
2. do a whole lot of incredibly unsafe things like sending pictures of your ID/bills/detailed bank info to relatively unknown and oft-foreign-based websites 
3. send a money order and hope that it doesnt spike in price by the time it arrives
If I want to use a credit card, paypal or domestic ACH transfer, I have few-to-no options. That's not exactly mainstream and until it can get there, this can't grow at the spectacular rate that everyone seems to want it to.
