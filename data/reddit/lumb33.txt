... future anything would mean more robust server or database technology therfore countering any chance of "security" being broken. Faster data pipe is inivetible, all the internet has done  is get progressly more advanced faster thanks to data link technology.
also I'm certain the Bitcoin core code can be comporised again, or in the near future. Although the best hackers capable of pulling that off simply wouldn't....  to say " create new BTC without POW"  because this devalues the coin... and is simply not a competitive advantage.
its best to find bugs to steal "already mind BTC " than to just create it etc... you cant game system like that. 
Therefore for instance the "offline hardware wallet companies true visonary because the absolute most important thing to do with bitcoin is understand how to protect it with security concepts + master seed backup mechanism + keeping that information secure for time &amp; all eternity haha!

well I meant in a sense lets be honest shit coins have no real value... only additional tech that could be easily implemented in bitcoin protocal very easy... The uniformed or gambling traders would touch them... I read most of the white papers/ core vision. 
remember you're comparing traditional companies with IP / trademarks or proitary tech...
Most of these projects open source my friend^^^ community powered.

localbitcoins bro... fuck an exchange.  P2P is a decentralized technology why support centralized exchanges?
p2p allows me to Select my buyer + payment method. If you can accept ZELLE thank me later because its 0 % fee to accept the FIAT payment
localbitcoins has any amazing system built in, remember to enable two factor authentication and make backups of your key in multiple secure locations. If you lose backup keys and get locked out could lose all Bitcoin or definitely delayed access to account to prove identify.
also LBC has brilliant system  Traders aka sellers/buyers always online 24/7/365
You may find buyer Will ing to pay higher exchange rates for certain fiat payment

he may have said that but that doesn't make revenue pal  
His company wont fail, they will take away market share from uva to deliver payloads to space  .
the current company is basically a monopoly and he disruppted that industry. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:33:02
Not upset and I did address that.  You are gullible person if you ever believed this company was started to deliver people to Mars....  He may have made that statement but Im sure it was those that should have been taken with a grain of salt. Not literally. 
I don’t know the company mission statement or vision but I know to be profitable they need to deliver payloads. 
Sending people to Mars doesn’t make$$$ now was my point. Investors are looking for ROI &gt;5yrs
