Actually yes, good point. I would be immensely happy if my post served as a cautionary tale for anyone else, like me, suffering from a complete and utter absence of anything even resembling common sense. I didn't write my post to ask people to send me their own hard-earned BTC - it's my own stupid fault I lost mine - but I'm not about to turn down an offer of help. I have always been the "helper" - I'm the girl who sends groceries to other moms who are in the shit, or who pays others' bills for them when they're stuck and so on, so this feels weird, but my bitcoin address is 36bx5bfLfXy4cMFwT37G8Xi6GZEDzJ2Q8P
I'd really like to give back to this incredibly supportive community too. I'm really amazed by how many supportive comments there are here, when I was expecting a complete and utter flaming (deservedly, too). If anyone knows of anything positive and useful I can do related to this, I'm all ears.

Oh dear. Thank you for replying. I had just made a payment to Coinbase using my debit card, and that transaction is only showing as authorised on my bank account - the money hasn't gone out. Can I stop this at the bank's end, and would Coinbase come after me for that?

You're so right. People have lost A LOT more. I am still in disbelief, really. I am honestly not dumb - I can only put it down to not enough sleep, being in a crappy mindset and transiently bad financial situation, all of which somehow overrode my critical thinking abilities.

Yes. I'm reframing it right now as a (verrrry expensive) lesson. I'm determined to do something today, as in right today, to turn this idiocy around somehow into a positive. I don't know what that is yet. Thank you. If I ever dabble in BTC again (once I stop hating myself), I will be sure to have control of my own keys!

Thank you so much. Once I stop kicking myself and crying for being such an utter idiot, I'll give it a read. I'm really grateful for your comments, thank you.

I know, right? I have been in a constant state of facepalm since I did this. I feel at least a million times more disdainful towards myself than you do.

That makes me feel marginally better. Kind of. Today has not been my day at all. Lesson well and truly learned. No. Such. Thing. As. A. Free. Lunch. I actually thought I knew this, but clearly not. Ugh.

(Also, thank you both SO much for being so helpful and for not straight up telling me that I've been an absolute moron)

I was really stupid and am actually shaking at what I've done. The past few weeks have been awful financially. This is so pathetic, but I was reading Elon Musk's Twitter feed after the news about him calling the British diver a "pedo", and just below his tweet was another one from him saying that he was doing a giveaway. I clicked it and it looked real - it was for "fans of crypto" and all you had to do was send a small amount of BTC, minimum 0.1, and you would get 10x back. Even reading this back it is mindblowing that I would fall for this. My defenses were low, and it just seemed like a godsend. So, I have a Coinbase account already with a tiny amount of BTC in it. I made a payment by my debit card to get it up to 0.1BTC (or a bit over - it was 0.11), and made the transaction. Then as it was pending and there was a time limit on getting into the giveaway, I googled to find out why it was pending, and in my search came across info that it was a scam. It is obviously a scam. And I am kicking myself so hard for falling for it. It was utter stupidity. I can't stop crying about it. That was my last money and it was a terrible, terrible decision to have made. It's entirely my fault and I'm not looking to put Coinbase or anyone else out of pocket. I just hoped that there might be a way to undo what I did out of foolish hope that things might be getting better for us through this giveaway.

Thank you, *stonecipheco*, for taking the time to reply. Ugh. Lesson learned I guess. I am an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:17:28
I know. That's what I'm kicking myself for. Had I actually stopped for a second, I would have seen it wasn't real. I just got caught up. I have literally never fallen for a scam. I've been the person who sneers at people who fall for scams. All it took was a run of bad luck and some desperation and there we go. Goddamnit.

Thank you for responding. I had a feeling it would be impossible. Is there anything that you think I might be able to do? I am so pissed with myself for being so idiotic. I am always so careful.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:36:12
Ha! Not too soon at all, I needed that laugh, thank you! :D
You are really kind, and that's a really kind offer. I'm not expecting anybody to come to my assistance - this is my fuckup and I have to own it, but I am incredibly grateful and I'm certainly not going to turn you down (particularly because I just totally fucked myself for money today).

Thank you, *Light_of_Lucifer*. What's been great about today is the nice and sweet comments from people like you, who should by rights be calling me out and flaming me for being so utterly idiotic.

Thank you :)
