US government is selling off their seized SR coin

Its just that i think the greater number of people and businesses adopting it will contribute to its rise and relative stabilization is a big factor in mass adoption. 
   I think 100usd is a psychological barrier and a lot of people who made money selling between 250-330usd will try and double their worth by buying twice as many coins for &lt;100usd.

it will go from $99usd to like $1000usd in &lt;24hours ahaha

its if he can prove that theres a reasonable chance* that something like that could have taken place, Ross would be free. It doesn't have to be Karpales=DPR, it doesn't have to be anyone in particular, it just doesn't have to be Ross by a decent amount. Love getting these AMA's and trial updates.

Remember when the Ruble was going good(before Crimea) and Russia didn't care about BTC?Maybe more russians are looking into btc because of the economic crisis which is just snowballing it.

Hear, Hear! I am willing to donate BTC to help pay for a rented space for this to take place! Crowd-fund this shit, it would be great to watch the developers and the businessmen talk it out and discuss how to increase their profits(and therefore support the BTC community)

i mean its probably true. I lost a decent amount with this seizure. I thought this was a safe wallet, its been around for a long time. I hope you're right in that LE doesn't go after small fish and tiny infrequent transactions that may seem questionable. Still mad about losing my about 500in btc and another 500 in alt coin investments. So i lost almost exactly around 1k. And its been years since i chatted lol used to be any member could talk.

thats what people said about btc in the early days. Its not about the 'get rich NOW/overnight' its the fact that there are plenty of people working on improving LTC(and other cryptos) and it may not happen today or tomorrow but 5 years from now that little bit of LTC might be worth 886k usd

if they answered my first tickets/emails then i wouldn't have to send the next 17 support tickets.
