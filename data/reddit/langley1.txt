Hmmm, no I think that capitalism and freedom is what is needed.  Things tend towards tyranny overtime, its a constant animating contest between liberty and tyranny.  The liberty created a lot of prosperity which had an unintended consequence of making the government too powerful.  Now the prosperity is going away, and soon the government power as well. Freedom will rise again. Its a constant cycle.

Ok, but the communist manifesto still has the main tenet of a central bank, with a monopoly on money.  Maybe their utopian vision is a little different than the Federal Reserve, but either way a monopoly on money only leads to corruption.  This is why throughout history central banks were fought to be kept out of our country, and they did not exist until 1913.  Since then the dollar has lost over 97% of its value.  Also a graduated income tax, public education, as well as many other aspects of the communist manifesto are found in our current system today.  The American Republic is long dead, and the Constitution is not respected any longer.  The America Land of the Free is gone, replaced by tyranny.

The Federal Reserve is a private bank your right on that, but its far from capitalist.  The Fed is a monopoly on money.  If you think capitalism is the enemy you are very very wrong.  Government is the enemy because the private entities, banks, and corporations capture the government and regulators through regulatory capture.  If you don't know what that means look it up..."regulatory capture"

America did great until 1913 when the Fed came into existence.  Also that is the same year the income tax was implemented.  Since then the dollar has lost over 97% of its value.  I think that is a bad thing, maybe you think its good.

Yes calling names, very credible compared to debating facts and truth.  Maybe you should check out [this video]( so you can learn how the money system truly works.

Yeah because communism doesn't exist, it always turns to fascism.  If communism could exist it would be a great utopia, but it can never exist.

Fascism is the marriage of corporations with the state.  The corporations buy off regulators through a process known as "regulatory capture", then they use their government power to secure monopolies.

What exactly is the agenda?  To spread truth and history to braindead zombies who need it packaged in an entertaining video in order to learn something?

You are right, but that doesn't mean capitalism is not better than communism.  Communism has never existed.  Look at history.  America was Land of the Free and had capitalism and freedom.  It created the most wealthy prosperous nation on Earth.  The USSR fell.  Communist nations always turn to tyranny much faster than capitalist places.  
Sure capitalism turns to tyranny as well over time.  But look at the progression.  Capitalism in America has turned very Communist and socialist prior to turning into tyranny. The tyranny followed from those communist policies because it gave government huge power which was harnessed by monopolies and corporations.  We have banker bailouts, and government intervening everywhere.  We have public education, the drug war, energy oligopolies that use carbon emissions to shut down competition. Forced Obama ScamCare.  You need permission to do anything.  Capitalism has slowly been eroded away over time, and is now crumbling at the base.
With banker bailouts, huge regulations, barriers to business, and restrictions on freedom, the capitalism we have today is a far cry of what it was in America's hay day.  That is why the wealth and prosperity is leaving this country.

You mean in fascist, communist America.
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:06:39
Capitalism always turns into communism, which then turns into fascism.

Oh did you know that the Federal Reserve Central Bank did not exist until 1913?  Did you know central banking is one of the main tenets of the Communist Manifesto?   So now we really now why Bitcoin struggles with mainstream adoption, its because of the stupidity of the general public who don't even understand the difference between capitalism and communism.

Ohh name calling, gives you much credibility.
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:18:01
Yeah its an animating contest between tyranny and liberty that never ends, as the Founding Fathers said.  Recduce the state power and you will reduce the ability for "capitalists" to control the state.
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:55:53
That is because we don't have anything near capitalism anymore, what we have is tyranny.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:01:17
Well central banks, public education, and a graduated income tax we have, and all of those are main tenets of the communist manifesto.  But I agree true communism doesn't exist anyways, because it always turns to fascism.
