This is satire, yes? Because we, you know, have fucking *photos* of the planet Earth that show it is, indeed, a sphere...

What? I know he is using the site as an example of people who deny obvious facts. I am just astounded this exists at all.

Seriously. You can google "Bitcoin Price" and a specific in-search app currency converter shows you the price!

Gmail disables image loading from unknown sources. At least, last time I checked they did. Although, they have talked about pre-fetching images on their own servers to make this issue nonexistent in the future...

Perhaps, but it isn't fair to say owning an Apple device "prevents malware". There have been reports from the Guardian showing that as long as a superficial attempt to make an app look good on the surface is pushed through and doesn't have too much fanfare, it will receive only the briefest of glances before approval. Therefore, since most apps that aren't rocking the boat make it through, it seems that the walled garden concept has degraded into a method of filtering out apps that Apple doesn't like.
Edit: [Link to article, for the curious.]( I understand it says Apple is "working on it", I just want to point out that they are far from perfect.

Of all the horrible travesties to nitpick, you land on the exchange.
Please, never change. :3

As a person who gets down-voted for occasionally voicing opinions contrary to the hive-mind, stop and think.
According to **reddiquette**, voting works best along these guidelines:


His comment, not matter how fallacious it may have been, certainly contributed to this discussion, because you are here.

That's not the point, don't change the subject. I never said Android was better.

Outsell every other car manufacturer in the state of California, even though he has a much smaller company? Remained the *only* private entity in the Space game? Be the first car company to fully repay loans from the U.S. Department of Energy?
I mean, sure, I support the Tesla circlejerk. But he has done some important things.

Seriously, reverting to damage control mode? I'm sorry, but this is pathetic. If this account does exist for the sake of "trolling", you shouldn't have admitted that. You are deviating from the point, and the point is you are acting in a way considered to be unacceptable.
^(And, kiddo? nice bate, mate)

I bought more today! What a great time to get in.

I bought at the small dip [here]( I feel okay with the situation as it is. okay with the situation as it is.
I mean, we all expect that one of two things must eventually happen:
1) Bitcoin utterly fails and we loose everything we put in it
2) Bitcoin takes off and we enjoy the use of the best currency in the world.

Hmm, I see. My point still stands though. I was trying to offer a counterpoint to the really heavy handed tirade against the man.

At least my post attempted to convey an idea, rather than a poor insult.

First off, think about what you are doing. This type of thinking is toxic to the community. Second, you are not humiliating anyone—except possibly yourself—by projecting a supercilious attitude that is based on ad-hominem and straw man fallacies.

My goodness, you've got nothing. I'm afraid this isn't the website you thought it to be. I notice several terms in your most humbling masterpiece of communication that are very popular on 4chan; Perhaps you'd best return to that image-board.
Now, I've indulged in your tangents long enough. Fare thee well!

Unfortunately, it appears a few people who commented on that article hid in the bunker of ignorance.
