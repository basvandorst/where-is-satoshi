This is why bitcoin cant go mainstream. Someone gets scammed because entry and exit to and from bitcoin is totally insecure and everyone is like "oh... everyone knows *thats* a scam site".

We wanted an unregulated currency that wasn't associated to any government or jurisdiction. Welp, we got it. I hope people can learn from this and try to find some way to bring a little accountability into bitcoin, or it looks like this project may be doomed to be a purely "child porn and drugs" type of currency.

I bought a caramel crunch frappachino with my starbucks card this morning and I suddenly realised that this is almost EXACTLY THE SAME as what happened to the people our ancestors kidnapped and beat and raped and forced to work for us.

Right but on the way in and way out of bitcoin it feels like I might as well walk into a shady service station and approach a leather clad hells angel in a smoky bar for some bitcoin with 1k eur in my pocket in terms of how trust worthy any of them are. Pretty much only coinbase I would trust, but I'm not in the US. I looked into buying some bitcoin but in the end I didn't because it was a clusterfuck of scammers gaurding the gates both on the way in and out. I read the accounts of people getting fleeced and I decided to let the community figure that shit out before I put much money in - and rightly so it seems. Its probably safer just storing online currency in WOW gold haha, and selling for bitcoin to take it out.

 I'm not talking about buying or selling crypto im talking about *intentionally and knowingly using crypto to evade currency controls*. That *is* breaking the law quite clearly. The law is you can only take out X yuan per year, and he's buying crypto specifically so that he can move it to his home country.
Its like how there is a law that you can't just take stuff from a shop without paying, and OP is posting online like "hey I found that if you hide it under your coat...". This is not a complex legal issue. There is a law, and he is breaking it. Its a stupid law, but that doesn't change the fact that hes blabbing about doing a crime on reddit.

He says hes using local bitcoins and alipay which is a mobile payment processor I assume. So most likely the yuan and bitcoin transactions are not explicitly linked. However, the government has backdoored most chinese brand mobile phones and many apps there feed info back to the government so it is quite likely that if the exchange or wallet via an app on the same phone accepting the alipay payment that they could be linked in an automated way. 
Regardless, hes breaking a financial law as a foreigner so most likely they would cancel his visa if the found out and leave it there. Unless hes Canadian, then its the death penalty...
Following the logic, I wonder about this scenario - Trouble in the Chinese economy might spike the BTC price if people try to use it as a store of value or a means of accessing the USD as a store of value, since other avenues for getting money out are increasingly closed off and the other major store of value - property - is likely to be ground zero in a chinese economic crisis. If you're chinese and SHTF its basically gold or bitcoin and bitcoin is harder to fake.

@_date: 2018-04-08 22:32:36
Yeah, I mean its pretty simple just see the future and perfectly predict the way the market will behave. 
If it were possible to tell that bitcoin is about to crash 24 hours in advance the person who could do that would be the richest person alive. If you think you can you are wrong.

The way the markets are tanking people must be scared it will get to bitcoin. Of course, that gear translates into sales. 
The opposite could also easily be true where people pile into bitcoin too to protect value, but since there near no adoption of bitcoin for regualar transactions theres a big block to that.

People were buying speculatively based on expections of others doing the same. How many times does this have to happen. 
Bitcoin has long term potential. 
When even non-investor types re buying something speculatively you need to GTFO

Personally I am overjoyed by the fall in value which means I can get in with some meaningful money. 
I plan to wait a month or two for things to settle down with the chinese regulation and see what price it finally sits on. Then I will buy as much as I can and wait for the next big bubble. The trend is upwards for all you ideologues, but it is going in a big zig zag.

China has promised more action against bitcoin as they believe people are laundering money using it. 
This is the argument that was used to shut down liberty reserve by the US and it is very dangerous if that belief becomes internalised in the Chinese governments dealings with bitcoin. The market is responding rationally not only to the measure in todays announcement but the promise of more to come. 
Many people here appear not to be as they are obsessed with the potential of bitcoin to take over the world and I agree with their super-long term assesment but if you aren't in for the ultra long term selling is not an insane move.The Chinese government are not fond of people taking money out of china and BTC represents a potential way to do so. 
Full disclosure - I own no bitcoin and want in, so I am hoping for something to temporarily depress the value of BTC which may have coloured my judgement.
