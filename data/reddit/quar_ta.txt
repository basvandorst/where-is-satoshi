Or maybe bitcoin is AOL? Who fucking knows.

If your in it for the actual year product there’s no reason to buy any until it goes under $1000.

Yeah the cool new currency that pretty much no one accepts and costs $40 to use!

The point is that I bought a commodity for 6k that I didn’t think was worth 6k.   
Why? Becuase I was certain that there were others who would buy by it for more.

No problem. Also - I know you want them to do there own research - but I would consider linking them to a simple article that explains bitcoin in basic terms.

Cunsult Tax professional. I think you probably have to either do LIFO or FIFO for tax purposes.

Lol do y’all really believe this ?

There are many- myself included- who think the correction has just started. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:31
Not really true. I bought in when it “skyrocketed” to 6k. Worked out ok. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:16:54
So it’s FIFO not lifo?

Duh. That’s the whole point of the “greater fool” theory. The fact of the matter is that anyone investing in bitcoin has no clue what could happen. 
It’s a speculative investment and anyone who puts a dollar in at any point could be considered a fool.

Or he never really got robbed.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:02:58
That is awful logic.

Reads really cringy to be honest with you. 
But more importantly- why help them? You should focus on being the “real estate guy for bitcoins”. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:38:41
It’s a little wordy. I’m not sure what you mean by “other exuberances” I’ve never used that phrase. 
People aren’t going to know what “HODL philosophy” is and you never explain it to them. I wouldn’t say “HODL” at all frankly. I would say something like ‘They understand the fluctuations of a new market and believe in the long term success of bitcoin’. 
I do think the comparison of bitcoin to real estate is a good one though. Hope you make a lot of money doing this.

It’s obviously the rate in which it fluctuates that causes people to say these things.
