I suppose if it's just about looking like you own a rolex then that makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 09:44:35
I'm not sure I can make the question clearer. Let me try.  
Why would you want to buy a replica rolex? 
@_date: 2016-04-09 17:35:05
I thought people bought a real one because they wanted to own a real one. Not sure how a fake one satisfies that is all I was thinking. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 09:16:23
I'm curious.  Why would you buy a replica rolex? 
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:51:50
No, the address you posted will continue to receive bitcoins. The new addresses are all determined from your original seed and can each receive transactions. More information here 
This behaviour means change addresses are managed for you and you are not reusing addresses, the implications of which can be found here

I'm with HSBC and I've had no problems with coinfloor. Been using them for at least 6 months. I normally transfer the btc to kraken for trading due to the higher volume.

But like governments they will naturally follow

What part of democracy is an illusion? Did you vote in the recent elections? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:24:16
Democracy controls that power
@_date: 2017-02-25 10:27:58
Wait so are you trying to hoard btc or spend it? 
@_date: 2017-02-07 17:13:34
But how will you spend from the paper wallet when you eventually want to? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 22:34:17
How so? What country do you live in? 
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:35:29
Lol why not buy them beer in return like a normal person? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:28:45
 "This is why you shouldn't store bitcoins on exchanges." 
It sounded like you didn't think bitcoins should be stored on exchanges.

Gold is a ponzi
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:43:50
Not being able to use investment gold for small transactions didn't hurt the price or utility of investment gold. Maybe bitcoin will end up like a precious commodity. Centralised solutions already work for normal daily spending so maybe nothing needs to change.

And anarchy would improve this how? Warlords and dictators would surely be worse. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:27:05
True. But I think if everyone followed that principle there wouldn't be enough liquidity and trade would suffer. 
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:28:06
Until enough other people do that and it stops working 
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:34:35
You should have waited for the sales! 
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:57:45
Is it? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:24:48
Tell me if I'm correct UKcoin. I reckon you probably have no friends, are probably overweight and/or ugly, and have only ever been rude to someone's face if they are smaller/weaker than you (i.e. girls/children).  In fact you are probably only ever offensive in person to people who have to be polite to you (like retails workers etc.) I am genuinely interested so please let me know if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:30:17
TBH you sound like quite the cabbage yourself.
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:24:31
Do you feel silly now? 
@_date: 2016-01-22 12:25:37
I feel sorry for you.
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:03:52
Except you didn't.

This must be a troll article

How do you have liquidity and price discovery without an exchange?

5.7564762 but as the long term trend is towards zero hopefully I can buy the rest soon
@_date: 2017-02-19 16:29:00
Luke-jr is pointing out that bitcoin and Bitcoin are separate. He is technically correct. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:28:14
Why not? 
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:33:52
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:10:40
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:43:13
So you were waiting for the price to drop to 800 so you could go back in time and sell at the top? Your post doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:22:50
No no no no no no
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:49:02
It's always the way! 
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:57:22
Because if you don't verify your own copy of the blockchain you aren't part of the network. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:16:32
Voting relies on proof of identity. Wouldn't cryptographic signatures and a centralised database be all you need?
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:18:42
I miss Junseth already ��
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:20:29
Yep definitely fat and ugly with no friends. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:00:46
Not necessarily the same amount of btc per second
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:01:56
But it is increased because we are getting greater than 12.5 per 10 mins.
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:20:45
Noooo! 
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:39:25
Yes but proof of identity is the only thing you would get from a blockchain. The implementation in most developed countries works well enough right now as is. Blockchain don't solve any of the current problems. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:06:15
Agreed they offer features sets. But I can't think of an example of a company that needs those features that isn't already better served by existing solutions. Any suggestions? 
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:53:08
Someone said mean things about bitcoin so people swapped their bitcoins for govcoins 
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:26:20

@_date: 2016-01-30 23:08:33
No you're right 69kg and tall definitely isn't fat. Congrats.

I know. When he started taking about the fact he bought dash to offload on greater fools I thought Chris would challenge him.
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:16:40
So what benefits would a blockchain provide for the voting system? Trustless timestamping? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:00:31
Just rewatched you guys interviewing vinay gupta. Fucking hilarious
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:16:18
Probably should've checked your backup before you did that. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:46:50
To be honest he also asked what phishing was. He is speaking for his audience when he calls bitcoin "sort of fictional money". Journalists feign lack of knowledge on behalf of their audience all the time. The term crypto currency would mean nothing to most of the audience. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:02:03
Your coins will be confiscated by the Bitcoin police

I want to be bitcoin retired in Thailand!
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:03:15
What happened? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 11:55:12
Yes 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:39:18
You can do that with a database. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:27:29
Don't forget improved privacy for every other bitcoin user.

Bwahahahahahahaha 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:51:00
I definitely agree that the majority of people have no use case. However, the 9.4 percent of Americans who use illicit drugs regularly is a substantial possible market. Then there is the fact that the global share of gambling taken by illegal betting is estimated at $500 billion annually. I'd say there is a huge market for bitcoin in both these industries. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:57:12
Buying drugs online? 
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:21:45
In settings tab (requires orbot)
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:59:51
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-04-20 22:06:59
Was it an ideological purchase or a utilitarian one?
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:01:25
Got it working when connecting through tor
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:26:58
No worries!

How do you generate your keys?

If you hold bitBTC through bitshares you can accrue interest. Check out bitshares.org or the bitshares subreddit

I think these look amazing

I like that you used pokemon cards in the example ��
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:49:48
Sorry I don't understand the question. Which people do you mean? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:10:07
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:12:45
It would not be the chain with the most work. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:35:51
You made all this up
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:46:07
One reason people need it is because sometimes government legislation mandates using it. Most non-ideological users would probably rather use something more convenient (paypal/visa/mastercard/bank transfer) but regulations prevent them from doing so. People who are using something because they have to rather than because they want to are what drive the fundamental value of the system.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:56:50
How did you buy it? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:17:42
Only if they were paid the true value of the labour. Which is unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:56:10
Oh right. I suspect only them. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:19:30
Why are you telling me this? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:50:30
Oh I get it. You're a libertarian. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:59:20
No problem
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:14:14
By evil do you mean people you don't agree with? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:54:17
Nodes prefer the first-seen valid chain with the most work measured in terms equivalent to the sum of the difficulty of all the blocks, not the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:36:24
None of those things sound particularly evil. I think some perspective would do you good.
