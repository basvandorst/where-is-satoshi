Of course
Something but the mobile wallets though..... It's fun looking down at my phone to ~$9,816 when my Trump dollars are enough fiat to live and plan.
Until the next morning when I see $2,001

I said it, and I've said it some more.
It's clearly my fault in the end. But still would not have happened if it wasnt for such a stupid feature.

Sorry for the error:001 due to the irritation that has erupted from the ignorance of a bunch of Steve Jobs cock suckers that think anything anything other than my stoned thoughts is gonna be such a gift on the rest of man
When all they're doing is slowly wrapping the overgrown oily, never once shaved nor washed follicles of their neck beard overlord around our necks year after year until we no longer pay taxes to which ever electronic/computing company we choose to use. 
Because I can't start my car until I have an iPhone plugged into the radio, and the keys or stored in the cloud, that I can only access once I double verify my SSN by voice recognition to both my fag watch and my iAnus. 
So I can finally pay a digital token worth 1.058 minutes of my life to the neckbeard overlord. 
Unless I'm a monthly iLife subscriber of course...... which gets you premium access to your own personal belongings for one low sacrifice of 10.555555555 minutes per month.

Mycelium to the end
Although my personal love for psychedelics may be a factor
But seriously, no, it's not. By the simple feature that cost me a good amount of change.............as well as my laziness
It doesn't make any sense at all why the would ever be a feature for anything. Fuck, if was concerned about someone stealing my phone to take all digital currency on it. I WOULD HAVE A LOCK SCREEN ON IT MYSELF, WHICH WOULD LOCK THE FUCKING APP

Thanks for being the only one to contribute knowledge on this post. Didn't think of that, but from the way the app was designed and the message it gave before wiping my wallet. I doubt itll work but giving it a go

Regretfully I am indeed quite fucking pissed over this situation
But honestly if you don't see the truth of the world and technology in the ramble.......you need to open your eyes.
The big tech companies are just in a race to make life completely dependent on them, feature by feature.
They can't overkill it with the restricting feautures or they'll run us off though, so they grab you by the nuts a little harder each year but that's OK. It's got 2 extra pixels than it did last year. ITS WAY BETTER NOW!!!!
And no we can't just make everything universal or generalized. Because that'd be China. But those communist bastards gonna let us idiots knock ourselves out.
Apple will control the USA by 2030

100% nigga
They "act* like they're "protecting" when all they're doing is taking control over what's mine

Moron, the result would have been the same?
No other wallet would have seized all function and evaporated from my phone when it rebooted. Get the fuck out of here with that ignorance.
Yes, as I stated clearly. 
AND 
A 
STUPID 
Because I'm not you, 
I'm not the smartest man in the world like you
When I go to bed at night. I don't latch and nail my window shut just incase an inverted hurricane would happen to suck me out, thus throwing me into ever-never land 
Like BRD did to my bitcoins on a brand new phone
Sitting on a computer desk
Placed securely 10 meters within the outermost walls of my house, however there is no sallyport, but 2 crash gates along the path from entry to item 
All with a seasonably normal barometric pressure, it was slightly higher temps for the region though
We all got a lot to learn from you my man
I know controlling the garage key and house key at the same time will bite me in the ass at some point but I don't wanta wait for my girlfriend every time I come home to utilize quality key control in my life like you probably do.
