It's a hot humid day in heaven. The line of people waiting to get into heaven has backed up and St. Peter isn't feeling too positive about work today. Worst of all, the electric pass machine is broken and the part it needs won't arrive for 3 more days. Wearily he walks up to the line of annoyed looking people to give them even more bad news. He waves over to an intern to bring him a megaphone. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to apologize for the slow movement today. Our quik-e-heaven machine doesn't look like it'll pull through. We'll begin doing the process manually in just a moment, but unfortunetly we'll only be able to let the worst deaths in today."
To this news everyone grumbles and begin to talk amongst themselves angrily. A few people started to walk away, perhaps because they had better things to do or perhaps because they automatically disqualified themselves. St. Peter swallowed hard and grabbing his clipboard. He walked toward the first in the line. The best way to deal with something difficult is usually full forward.
"Hello sir, having a good day?"
"Good enough", replied the man acting aggravated. 
"Alright well, lets get to it. How did you die sir?"
"Well sir...", he kicked at the wispy clouds, "You see, I had been suspecting my wife was cheating on me for some time now. And well, that day-- that I died-- I had come home early from work and walked into the bedroom and there were a man's clothes scattered all around the room. And my wife. She was laying in bed covered and embarrassed all over. I knew what happened. I knew she cheated on me. And most of all I knew that son-of-a-bitch was still in my home. We live on the 26th floor of our building and the only way in or out I came through. So... Well I started looking for the bastard. I looked through everything. I tore out drawers! I threw the clothes out of the closets! Hell, I even looked under the rug. I just couldn't find him. And then-- exasperated, I looked out onto our balcony of our 26th level apartment and saw a man hanging onto the rail over the edge. So, in my rage, I walked out there and started banging on this man's hands. I let it all out. I hit at his hands with all my might, but the dude will not let go. He just won't let go! I get so angry that I go and get a hammer and start banging on this guy's hands with the hammer. Finally he lets go. Then the asshole has go get lucky and fall in some bushes! I get so fucking angry that I pick up our whole fridge and throw it on the guy... Then, well my heart goes out on me and I die of a heart attack... So, that's how I died."
St. Peter is taken aback by the story. "Well... That was something! And I guess that was a pretty bad death. Wife cheating on you and a heart attack too... Alright come on in!"
With that the man walks into heaven and St. Peter approaches the next person in line.
"Hello sir, so how about you tell me how you died."
"Well sir, you see I was exercising on my 27th level balcony when I tripped and fell off. I thought I was a goner, but luckily I managed to grab onto the balcony below. So-- well I'm just hanging there wondering what to do when I see a man coming up from inside. I think, 'Oh thank God I'm saved', but then the man starts banging on my hands! This guy is trying to murder me! But I won't let go man, I won't let go! I don't want to die. Finally the man gets up and leaves for a second. But then he comes back with a fucking hammer! I can't take that man. I can't take that! So... I let go. And luckily I land in some bushes and survive. Then that fucking asshole goes and throws a fucking refrigerator on me! So... that's how I died."
For a moment St. Peter is shocked, the coincidence was astounding. But remembering his training and the pressing need to be fast he snaps out of it. "Oh.. um.. wow okay. So getting your hand beaten, falling, and getting smashed. Oh man I'd say that's pretty bad. Well okay, come on in then."
The man walks in and St. Peter walks up to the third man in the line and says, "Hello sir, do you mind telling me how you died?"
At first the man looks around, making sure no one else can listen in. He walks in a bit closer to St. Peter.
"Okay... so picture this. I'm hiding naked in a refrigerator."

On the point of inflation, I've heard it said by a professor that inflation is another form of taxation. Anyone have an explanation for this?
@_date: 2012-12-30 22:26:18
But your question was also concerning the long term success of bitcoins. Obviously there's no model for a bitcoin economy, but it can be said that it doesn't have the same problems with deflation and that deflation might not be a problem.
@_date: 2012-12-28 03:42:41
Probably because OP is a college student and works a minimum wage job. 
And there are many reasons to get bitcoins, maybe OP's parents helped OP out the month before and OP is repaying them. Maybe they use bitcoins for this because of little to no transaction fees. 
I can't stand people who automatically assume something about someone they don't know anything about.
@_date: 2012-12-30 21:28:19
Okay I think I came up with the answer on deeper comment in this. The answer isn't fully economic, though the economic implications are phenomenal, it's a mathematical answer. Bitcoin is a new system unlike anything ever before and can't be compared to old systems like you're doing. Get ready to have you brain blown like mine just was.
While there will always be 21 million bitcoins, a finite amount, it can be indefinitely divided. Which means while there is a finite amount of bitcoins, there is an infinite amount of currency. Bitcoin is both finite and infinite at the same time. 
Which as far as I'm concerned fixes the problems of hoarding and makes it the perfect currency in my view. While 21 million is the end on one direction, there actually isn't an end in the other.
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:16:05
I just have a mild interest in economic theory, and I'm no expert but doesn't the fact that bitcoins are infinitely divisible break your argument? As people hoard and the price of 1 bitcoin rises and rises people can still buy and sell through bitcoins like normal. Instead of have to use the 1 bitcoin you have that's worth so much you can use 0.00005 of that bitcoin to buy something. 
Then people can hoard as much as they want and people can still spend. It's not like people are just going to stop buying things and the economy will come to a halt. People still need to eat, people still need computers and phones, and people still need to pay their utility and internet bills.
[added later]
One thing I imagine that could come of this is that it makes hoarding and deflation a positive thing. People now work all their lives and try to spend as much as they can and eventually die in debt. But with this, those people could work for 40 years and build up a savings of bitcoins and then retire and live off their savings that has now made them millionaires.
I'm not an expert like I said, but it sounds like a really good thing.
@_date: 2012-12-30 20:17:18
agreed, this is something I'd like to see debated more
@_date: 2012-12-30 21:09:29
Yeah but doesn't the fact that it can be infinitely dividable mean that hoarding can safely go on while investing can go on. 
And what's wrong with it being good for the individual too. Our current system only benefits people who already have money and can invest it. Working class people don't know how to invest or have enough money to invest. I'm 24 with a son and a disabled wife, I only make $700 a month because I can't work away from home. I can't invest, my expenses are too much. But I can invest in bitcoins, which I can do with any amount of money(even $0.50), and I can be sure the my investment will grow. 
It seems to me that you're stuck on the gold standard type of system. Bitcoin is different, and it isn't something anybody has ever seen before. It's really a hybrid of a deflation system because there's a finite amount of bitcoins and an inflation system from being indefinitely dividable. You see, there is at the same time 21,000,000 and an infinite amount of bitcoins. It benefits the economy as a whole and the individual too. At least that's the take from someone on the outside.

@_date: 2013-04-20 01:42:26
I believe your thinking too much into this. Already banks are invesitgating Bitcoin to get into it. Western Union is looking into it. Eventually the government itself may start trying to get into bitcoins too to ease the transition. Maybe you could pay taxes in either bitcoin or dollars? By the time it reaches a tipping point everyone will probably be using both currencies and eventually we'll just phase the other out.
And if you're wondering how the government could get people to pay taxes? All bitcoin transactions are in public view. You'll just register your public bitcoin addresses with the irs and they can monitor at any time see your activity. Yeah it'll be harder to know who owns what address. But the moment someone uses their address to buy something online and have it sent to their house, or with an account connected to their social network they'll know.
Maybe those events will play out like that if everything happens at once. But in reality this is probably going to be a very slow and gradual process. Certaintly there can be some problems but not as big as you suggest. Why? Because people like you have already thought of how it could go wrong so we can avoid it. Good job.

I don't agree 100%. We know the price can reach $250 or even higher, fast. Buying at $50 while it's falling will definitely get a return.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:46:52
This is what I've been waiting for actually. No offense to anyone who lost money. To me this is a long term investment. With long term investments you expect things to rise and fall and just continue buying in. 
Especially considering that bitcoin is still a new thing, just a few years old, I expect it to be risky. At this point, I don't think there should be anyone hoping for a quick cash option with bitcoin unless your willing to lose it.
By the way, how low you all thinking it'll go? Getting ready to buy more in.

I'm not sure if that's sarcastic or not. That's way more effort than it should be. I have a wife and son and don't even have my own home yet, let alone two disconnected from the internet. I only have 1 computer. I barely had enough spare money to buy the few bitcoins I have.
Do you suggest I have a fingerprint scanner and a 24/7 gaurd service too? Would I have to drive my car to this secure location to grab one of the SD cards just to go buy a new 0.2B keyboard from a bitcoin electronics store?

Long term investment is where it's at. Buy low and hold. It will rise and fall many many times. Every time it falls buy more and more. Prices falling are a good thing for you then. 
Eventually you'll have quite an amazing investment built up. Bitcoins aren't going anywhere, there's already millions moving through and they're reaching mainstream.

But there is more security left. Most likely the java app would have accessed the wallet application in ram and manipulated it. Bbitcoin-qt is a C++ app so I don't think normal java exploits would work. If the wallet had been watching its ram for suspicious access and closed down with a warning, this wouldn't be a problem. I'm gigantically over simplifying it but it's something that should be mandatory in wallet software if it's not already.
To be honest, though, reading OP's post again. I'm somewhat convinced it wasn't the java applet and instead was something that got onto his computer probably days before. Manipulating other programs in memory isn't very easy. In that case OP should of been running Malwarebytes.
Not everyone gets computers easily though. To many what happens behind the scenes of a computer seems like magical craziness. With these people I don't agree with the blame associated with calling them careless. It's innocence not carelessness.

I've seen this video twice. The first time I saw it my mind was blown. But now I can't see why it would work.
If they all agree on the color yellow, eve has it. Then they pick their random color add it to yellow and send it to each other. Eve also has those too. Why doesn't Eve just remove yellow from these two new mixed colors to get their original?
While it shouldn't be easy to reverse it, it should be possible. I haven't played around with cryptology so it may not be apparent to me.

I don't agree with this type of view. For a technical minded person yes that's careless. But for an average user. It wouldn't be surprising at all that someone would just click allow and be done with it. That's something bitcoin devs need to think about if it has any hope of hitting mainstream.

To be honest I really don't want this. It's just my own opinion though. I've settled on bitcoin and I'm sticking to it. I like the idea of one currency to rely on. Otherwise if there are multiple it'll probably become a digital commodities exchange. Which is a cool idea, but remember bitcoins are money first.

Why don't you just buy yourself a new $3 calculator at [bitcoinstore]( Showing an actual business that's using it and buying office supplies should raise an eyebrow. 
They'll want to know what bitcoin will do to make them compete better. Imagine if some small office needs to buy more office supplies and when they buy them payment is near instant. No hoops to go through. And your company provides that service.
Also imagine the security you could provide with it. No need to even expose yourself by entering giving credit card information or bank information on what could be a shady site or shady guy on the phone. Just send the funds to the payment address. No one could ever steal your money or spend it just from knowing your address.
I never hear about this. How much safer bitcoin is to buy things online than a credit card which forces you to expose yourself every time.

This is really overkill. The best way to make a password I've found is to take a favorite lyric from a song. Preferably one that not everyone knows is your favorite. Then take the first letter of each word from the lyric then insert some numbers.
It looks completely random yet you'll always remember it by playing the lyric over in your head.
For example, here's a few lyrics from Rolling in the Deep by Adele.




    tafsimhrafpaibmotd
now replace some letters with numbers, better to use ones that look like the letters so they're easily remembered.
    tafs1mhrafpa1bm0td
maybe some symbols at ends and maybe between the two lyrics, so they're memorable.
    ]tafs1mh-rafpa1bm0td[
Now you have what is equivalent to a random password yet you will always remember it and not have to write it down.

You completely missed what I said. They'll cancel each other out. It's part of the plan that we work our way down decimal points as the value rises. Eventually you'll buy a cup of coffee for 0.000001 of a bitcoin. That's why we have names for each of the decimal points.
That's what's so revolutionary about bitcoins. It's an abstract mathematical concept within an economic world. Bitcoin works on unnatural rules that only exists within the minds of mathematicians but not the real world. There's no current economic model that can match it.
Basic idea:
You get paid 6 bitcoins today in wages. Deflation increases, throughout 20 years. You'll be paid 0.6 bitcoins. Over 20 years, deflation increases again. You'll be paid 0.06 bitcoins. Over 20 years, deflation increases again. You're now paid 0.006 bitcoins in wages. You never run out of zeros to put in to keep up with deflation.
@_date: 2013-07-21 17:28:15
I still hold the believe that hoarding will not effect the bitcoin economy negatively. Mathematically there are infinite bitcoins. 
I imagine it having two sides to the explanation. On one hand there is a limit on the physical number of bitcoins. On the other hand, they are infinitely divisible. When we start running low all we have to do is go down a decimal point and there will be plenty. We will never run out of bitcoins, because bitcoins are a mathematical concept and not physical like gold.
For me this is the single most mind blowing aspect of bitcoin, that it is both finite and infinite at the same time.
