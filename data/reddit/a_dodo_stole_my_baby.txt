Given the price fluctuation in the past month, it's just as likely that we can possibly wait 1or 2 months before another ATH. That's why I hodl.

I would have a full node running in no time if I could figure out how to open port 8880 on my Google WiFi mesh.
I've gone through the port forwarding settings but it doesn't actually seem to open the ports.

I agree, don't do this at home.. although Tesla's autopilot helps.

Honest question here.
I see posts that indicate Venezuela is prime for a Bitcoin takeover, but how are they expected to buy an $8k digital coin when their currency is worthless to the point where they're making handbags out of the notes?
Please don't take this as fud.. I am a strong on Bitcoin for life. Just genuinely curious.

I like my Ledger Nano S and will probably add an X to my collection soon. I'm not a day trader, so a simple device with an easy to learn interface satisfies my hodl mentality. 
One common gripe about the Nano is that you can only hold an average of 3 or 4 apps at a time. Since I'm not trading a bunch of coins on a daily basis, this doesn't bother me. I install an app, move coins to the wallet, and uninstall. No big whoop. I personally don't think keeping all of the apps installed is a good idea. If the worst case scenario happens, I don't need to give the thief a menu of all the different coins I own.

My understanding is that once liquidity increases, fees will be paid out to LN hosts for routing payments.
@_date: 2018-11-26 12:48:29
Right now, probably not. However once lighting becomes better established, it'll be possible to collect fees from active payment channels. I still have a lot to learn so I'm not 100% sure how everything fits together.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:08:36
Ahha. Okay, I understand. 
One step at a time, I suppose. I'd love to be 100% decentralized and look to my own node.

Can you explain what you mean? Isn't anything over 8 connections a full node?

Didn't Coinbase add Bitcoin to PayPal conversions during their 12 days of Christmas announcements?

Easy. When you buy an X, use the same seed to have a backup device.

I'm not too worried about it... my computer is usually on anyways.
I would like to move to a smaller setup... like a Raspberry Pi that requires much less energy.

Did you just try to get me to download a Word doc? 
That's not suspicious...

Oh, right. In coinbase you can send to a btc address or an email address. I bet you're on to something.

What makes the hashrate increase? More full Bitcoin nodes, or more miners? Or do they both contribute to the hashrate?

Thank you, I'll check out that approach.

Have you had any issues with running out of memory yet? I set up a Raspberry Pi node but would regularly run out of memory and the daemon would force quit. I see you have \~1GB of memory, which is what I had. Any issues?
After Christmas I hope to invest in a slightly more powerful rig.

CNBC does that with Bitcoin and something very similar to Tesla. One ounce of bad news and the sky is falling. Someone is pulling their strings.
