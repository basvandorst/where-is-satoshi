There is always a way if they are motivated enough and if you are a target that is worthy enough. You always leave a fingerprint somewhere. And without being too paranoid we simply do not know the true extent of their capabilities.
Even if we only look at your first step, you'll most likely be on CCTV footage as having been in X location, witnesses can testify that you purchased a laptop in cash, your cellphone will confirm your location at the time, router logs will confirm which MAC you connected with etc.... I'm not gona go into much more depth on it but you're also making assumptions about TAILS &amp; TOR and assuming that they have no capability to de-anonymize it. The truth is they have been working on exploiting it and finding holes for years so don't be so quick to blindly trust it. See  for example. Underestimate their talents at your own peril.

I think we can all agree that it would certainly be much easier for an insider than an outsider. That's obvious and it's not to say that it would be impossible for an outsider, nothing is impossible. But having worked for several large IT providers, I know too well how lax security generally is internally and how access-control often isn't really enforced very strictly. People just leave their laptops unsecured on their desks, they write down their passwords, they leave their two-factor auth tokens lying around etc... Employees are generally given way too much trust and access.
Knowing this all assumptions should be challenged and any statements by Bitfinex should be taken with a grain of salt. People should be very cynical about anything that they claim or state.
It doesn't even matter if the employees are well remunerated. People are greedy and if they can come up with a way to significantly enrich themselves they probably will. This is a crime that's sadly too easy to get away with and once the funds are stolen they becomes virtually untraceable.
Furthermore if they resume their operations before they have a complete understanding about how this went down and who perpetrated it then that should raise serious flags.

Absolute morons.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:56:37
Ok. So are you saying that the police never investigate or solve crimes? Are you seriously trying to argue that cops are all conspiring to solve as few crimes as possible so that crime rates go up? Take your tin-foil hat off your head for a second please.
Your incentive argument is just as idiotic. I have a job that pays me X per month. Does that means that I will only do the bare minimum to meet the requirements or the job and ensure that I don't get fired? Believe it or not, beyond financial incentives, people are actually motivated by simply wanting to do a good job and excel. In turn they learn, get experience, and eventually their efforts are recognised and rewarded. They eventually move up in the chain.
Do you think cops who never solve any crimes get promoted?

Again you simply patronise law enforcement and make broad generalisations due to your own limited personal dealings with them. You are drawing conclusions from a very small sample size.
Let's revisit your original statement which was that law enforcement does not understand blockchains. Sure your local traffic cop may not be well versed with blockchain technology, why should he be? That's not his role. Believe it or not there are different fields of specialization within LE and different departments and agencies.
Are you trying to imply that no investigator has ever heard of blockchains or bitcoins? Do you think that complex financial crimes or hacking crimes never get investigated? Do you honestly believe that there are no intelligent investigators who are able to leverage the know-how of other experts to conduct a complete investigation? Have you heard of agencies such as the FBI? Do you really believe that no crime involving bitcoin has ever been investigated to date? You have a completely myopic view of law enforcement and their capabilities. You need to look beyond your local mall cop. If LE were all bumbling fools then believe me crime rates would be much higher than they are.

"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."
It's only a matter of time until funds disappear again. It could happen in a few days, weeks, months, but mark my word it will happen again.
Either there was no attack and this was a planned inside job or they left the doors wide open and don't want to fess up to their negligence.To resume operations this quickly says all you need to know.
I don't think they would actually resume operations without knowing the attack vector but if we assume this narrative has any truth to it then it's basically like changing the locks on your front door when the thieves got in through the window and hoping for the best.

When you consider the fact that most people have very poor computer literacy, even the 20-30 year olds, it's really not that surprising.

Here's some actual advice if you have no game, or just don't like putting much effort in.
1. Sign up to the top sugar daddy website.
2. Set a weekly budget, for example $200-$400 for chicks.
3. Profit.
Take it from me, these websites have absolute hordes of attractive young girls that are down to put out for a bit of cash. The naive ones (majority) cost considerably less than professionals (escorts, strippers etc). Easy to setup longer term arrangements or just one-offs, depending on what you're after. It's a buyer's market so you have a lot of options. Probably costs just about as much as actually having a GF. Won't make that much of a dent in your BTC balance.

Yes but you don't need to know anything about BGP routing to use the Internet and understand what it can do for you as an end-user.
Can someone really understand the paradigm shift that bitcoin represents without understanding anything about the blockchain? Arguable in my opinion...
All I can say is that in the present day, the usability is still absolute shit and I wouldn't trust the average person to store &amp; use bitcoins responsibly. Over 8 years since it was conceived, I think that it should be a lot further by now.

Get a grip. Honestly if you're poor as fuck and you panic over a bit of volatility you should not be investing, period.
I've held since early 2013. Held through MtGox and all the other major crashes. I'm well diversified, so even if it all goes to shit I won't be out on the streets sucking a dick for a dollar. I make a good living and it would take me maybe half a year at most of work to save up what I'd lose, it's not that big a deal.
If you're checking the price every 5 minutes or you panic every time there's a small drop then you simply have too much invested and you should get out.

The problem is that it's just too complicated for the average person to understand, yet alone use. Hell it's hard even for people with a background in computer science.

They don't catch most sophisticated attackers and attribution is usually very difficult if not impossible.
It's not hard to use someone else's wifi and proxychains through tor or a couple of compromised servers. You overestimate the government's capabilities, reach and resources. Anyone who knows some basic opsec can go undetected.

Owning a BMW with a BITCOIN number plate doesn't mean that you have millions of dollars in bitcoins. Just like wearing a gold chain around your neck doesn't mean that you're a millionaire.
