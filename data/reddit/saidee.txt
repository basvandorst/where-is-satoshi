i think you have to own them to color them. so that would be ok for me. 
what if the USA take these 600k bitcoins, color them red and say: xyz is our digital fingerprint/signature. all 600k red bitcoins are official backed by the US.  with Colored Coins this theory is possible. with simple bitcoins its not possible.

I or you are nothing, you can not compare. mtgox is the spearhead of the bitcoin/fiat bridge. no doubt that the banks hesitate after the huge revenues in spring. the same thing would happen to bitstamp or every other exchange when it happens in that short time. these problems has nothing to do with broke company. mtgox was a very long time the biggest and stablest player in the whole bitcoin-universe. many others came, 99% are gone. mtgox is still here &amp; im sure he will survive these hurdles.
