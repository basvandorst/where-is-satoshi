You own such a small
amount BTC would have to skyrocket to over hundreds of thousands for you to see significant returns lets say turning your $100 into $1000 BTC would have to go from its $6000 range to well over $600,000

I agree OP hasnt heard about cannabinoids in the cannabis plant apparently. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:40:26
���������� you bought such a pathetic amount it would have made more sense to buy ethereum as with $150 you'd own 1/3 of a coin as opposed to owning 1/1000th of a coin like you do with bitcoin do the math guy BTC is trading at $6400 you own 125 of that catch mah drift.

calm yourself 1 btc will be $8,000 by Febuary 2019 I base this on Bakkt and futures coming out plus other big boys making moves Q2 of 2019 plus ICE said whenever BTC stabilizes around $8500 is when institutional money will pour in heavily!
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:32:42

I give no fuck about Data anyalysis but im a 8 month hodlder BTC is overbought its gonna see a slight pull back maybe its a big maybe the bulls could pump another billion n shit and poof we hit 9K . Its best to see small sustainable growth. We outta wait for the BTC ETF while BTC ranges around 8-9K and maybe dips below to 7.5K a strong resistance line we have defended time and time again. Those over bought levels though ugh but the RSI shows a healthy range. I guess its up to the illuminati
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:43:53
i have yet to buy bitcoin my plan was to sell my cents coins after they break dollars homey dollars then ill buy bitcoin wait for a dip and bammn hope bitcoin breaks $11,000 before August and just like that it happened
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:45:51
Gold has a similar pattern throughout history its seen like 4 bear markets and it looks like BTC is following the gold algorithm so until ETFs are released then i cant picture that beautiful 1 trillion market cap

good for you mate I will put all my heart and soul into NANO, BAT, XLM, and that is it maybe WAX too! I dont like BTC because what is the point of getting wealthy at the expense of destroying the planet. BTC is just too electricity hungry and we just dont have the means to make electricity without fossil fuel burning. Do I envision a future where bitcoin is mined using nuclear power and we have the means to safely dispose of nuclear waste? Of course but I think there are coins out there that so the same thing as BTC without murdering the planet. You can mine all the bitcoin and then 30-50 years from now we look back and go aw shit was it worth it?

denials scary the world caught on that btc fucks over the world via grotesque energy consumption and come now fucking dash and zcash do the same shit ������ thanks satoshi for the idea of crypto currency now lets move on to more efficient cryptos
