Those are Ver's other failed Bitcoin forks doofus. You're obviously not very knowledgeable about your messiah's past. Also, I think that might be your 4th comment saying "core shills are obvious." You sound like a broken record little homie. Might want to get your head checked.

Lol if you think all of the pump was organic

I'm not deifying shit homie. Ain't no fucking wheelhouse.

Hunter was a brillaint trailblazing writer with a shit ton of heart. McAfee is a morally bankrupt blowhard with no charisma. Gonna have to disagree

But Roger Ver is such a good programmer. No? Well surely he's got some technical expertise that qualifies him as an authority on cryptocurrencies, right? No? Oh he's just a shady ass entrepreneur that spent time in prison for his shady dealings? Sounds like the kind of person I want having unilateral control over Bitcoin. That was definitely "Satoshi's Vision™"
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:55:01
Damn it sounds like this dude is just repeating the same 3 phrases over and over. Brain damage?
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:16:35
Fuck Ver and all of his lame Bitcoin forks.

You're doing a great job of showing your civility and impartiality. Name calling is truly the way to get people to see your point of view. Have a lovely day

Bitcoin Unlimited is the true Bitcoin, no wait- Bitcoin 2x is the true Bitcoin, no wait- Bitcoin Cash is the true Bitcoin... See a pattern ?
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:55:32
Bitcoin Cash is his THIRD attempt to fork and control Bitcoin. He has no programming experience and is just a shady entrepreneur who spent time in prison. BCH is unnecessary and bad for the crypto space in general.

No whey brah Satoshi's true vision was a coin controlled by an egomaniac with no coding experience /s
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:01:26
Lol. Look at his track record- 2 failed forks and time in jail for shady business practices. Excuse the rest of us for respecting consensus over an egomaniac
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:56:19
Ver is a fucking con man. I don't see how anyone can get on board with that tool
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:55:14
For most people it seems crazy to throw in with a shady entrepreneur with no coding background over the vast majority of Bitcoin developers. Adhering to the white paper like the Bible over attempting to find ways to solve real scaling problems seems like a weirdly Luddite approach to something as novel as block chain tech. If you weren't as dense as you seem you'd be attempting to illuminate people as to why BCash is technologically Superior to BTC. Something tells me you don't have that info- hence your name calling and general annoying demeanor
