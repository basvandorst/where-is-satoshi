I think what you meant to say is "SEO will be a thing until Google no longer exists." No?

That's basically correct.

I think you accidentally a couple of words.

Do you have any evidence at all for that claim?
Every story I've seen on the subject involves DPR screwing up in 2 major ways:
1. He initially posted about Silk Road using an alias and accounts that could be tied to his real name
2. He connected to the server hosting the Silk Road website using a VPN, not Tor. That VPN provider could have (and probably did) reveal DPRs connection details to law enforcement making it very simple to find the location of the server(s).

It's pretty simple really. With symmetric crypto the encryption key would need to be kept in memory during encryption, possibly written to disk at some point, and sent over the network either to or from the C&amp;C servers.
With asymmetric crypto all of this is avoided. It doesn't matter if the user gets ahold of the public encryption key if the private key has never touched that users computer and exists only on the C&amp;C server.

I don't mean intentionally. Regardless of whether the key is ever written to disk, just having the key available on the machine at some point gives security researchers and anti-malware developers a window of oppurtunity I'm sure the cryptolocker developers want to avoid.

Tor is not ([presently]( financed by the US military. It has previously been funded by DARPA and the US Naval Research Lab. It has also received funding in part by foreign governments and institutions. The core Tor development team also includes individuals who are not US citizens or residing in the US.
