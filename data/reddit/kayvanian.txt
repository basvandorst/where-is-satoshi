Yea, because you can blame a company for choosing to comply with government requests instead of going against them in a revolutionized fashion, a risk that no sane man would take. The companies protect your data from the government the best they can; you want to be mad at someone, be mad at the government.
Not to mention that companies like Google, Microsoft, etc. had no idea just how bad the NSA's infiltration of private data was; pre-PRISM, it's just standard warranted requests for data. Look at what Google is doing now, encrypting your data internally after the reveal of PRISM, among other things.
I certainly expect to see you marching up to the NSA's headquarters to take a stand against this injustice, Mr. Revolutionary. Until you do, I don't see how you're in a position to call for anyone else to do the same.

Of course they're focused on existing and established things. It's an encyclopedia for notable content, not a place to host "revolutions" or mention some random surgery center (if you simply added "fastest-growing, most talked about surgery center", that definitely sounds like a promotional unsubstantiated claim).
Everything on Wikipedia is deemed worthy of mention based on its appearance in reliable and independent sources - that's what an encyclopedia is, a conglomeration of information from different sources. Yet, compared to other general sources of information, Wikipedia is still very liberal in what it is able to include.
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:18:08
There's a difference between the Wikimedia Foundations and the editors that edit pages. Anyone can edit. *You* can edit. What happens to the bitcoin article doesn't represent the views of the foundation, which is involved in a *lot* more than just Wikipedia.
But regardless, regarding the actual deletion of the page, bitcoin was arguably *not notable* at the time. Just because it has a community and users doesn't mean it deserves an article, just as the many altcoins in the current aren't notable now.
* [Here's]( the original deletion discussion.
* [Here's] ( the first deletion review.
* [Here's] ( the second deletion review.
* And finally, [here's] ( the final discussion, five months later, that determined that bitcoin has received enough coverage to warrant an article.

Aye, bad wording on my part. Perhaps I'm wrong, but what I meant was that people and organizations would create a plethora of promotional pages (which is already a pretty big problem on Wikipedia), with little regard to maintenance from an encyclopedic standpoint.
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:44:56
How much more do you want? It's still a proportionally minor payment option, and it's not their job to promote it. If they listed all their payment options on that page, it'd have a dozen. They're accepting Bitcoin, have announced to the masses that they do so, and if you support their organization, you should donate.
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:22:13
Any idea where exactly? I'm just curious what their response was, if it was the foundation. It was more than likely just normal Wikipedia editors if it was at a place like the help desk, a talk page, etc.

Heh, I was thinking of "photoshop" too. I think these companies are big enough, new enough, and prevalent enough in everyone's lives that it actually helps them to have their names used generically, to an extent. It gets ingrained in everyone's mind as the industry standard. At least for now.
But something like "for dummies", I can definitely see that withering away with enough generic use.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:31:37
Because the Stars Wars universe is noteworthy (as bitcoin also is now) - it's a subject people look up and has been written about, etc.
Not saying that the way that Wikipedia determines what should be covered is perfect - and there are definitely areas where bias is apparent. But this isn't a good example. A huge list of Jedis is indeed rather silly, but that doesn't give one more credibility than the other in terms of coverage.
Edit: The list of ancient jedi you mention isn't actually a standalone article anymore. It's been merged into the larger list of all Star Wars characters.

Thank you! Back when Wikimedia was discussing the addition of bitcoin as a donation option, one of the employees said this:

Wikimedia does a lot of testing for what works vs. what doesn't. Last year, they tested banners with and without the Amazon link, and found that adding the Amazon link was beneficial. The link wouldn't be there for Amazon if it wasn't one of the top ways donors donate.

Not at all - Wikipedia has a standard of inclusion called [notability]( Basically, a subject should have an article only if it has been covered in a variety of reliable and independent sources. If the notability of a subject is challenged, deletion discussions involving the community are usually what determines whether or not something is notable.

Eh, the way I use Coinbase is to only hold a little Bitcoin at a time (no more than $15). This way, spending with Bitcoin is super fast and easy for the little things I do buy with Bitcoin, and in the very low chance that the worst *does* happen, not much is lost.
Anything more than a little bit though, should obviously be stored elsewhere or with more security.
@_date: 2014-07-23 05:36:48
At the moment, most companies assumingly convert most, if not all of their Bitcoin immediately into fiat. Overstock, for example, only holds on to 10% of BTC from Bitcoin transactions. This is real easy to do, as BitPay allows companies that do transactions through them to immediately receive fiat instead of Bitcoin.
Will these companies ever start holding onto more of their Bitcoin and start distributing it themselves? Maybe, but very slowly. It'll take a while for Bitcoin to be more widely accepted to the point where companies will have the resources and reasoning to start transacting with it themselves. In the meantime, they still do their work internally with the dollar (e.g. paying salaries, buying supplies, etc.), and the current biggest benefit of accepting Bitcoin (more customers and lower transaction fees) is met simply be accepting Bitcoin, not holding it.

It's still very much a place for discussion, but in regards to ads...is that even a bad thing? Bitcoin is a relatively new thing that needs popularity to grow. Encouraging merchants to accept Bitcoin, and boosting/helping businesses that do start to accept it is great and vital.

Eh, there are a lot of problems with that. Wikipedia isn't an "authorian regime" or a corporation, but literally just a community of anyone. If you want to edit, feel free to. All the Wikimedia Foundation does is provide the backbone to Wikipedia and a bunch of other projects, and the community does the rest. When articles are deleted, it's a consensus of discussions held by anyone - not the Wikimedia Foundation.
Now if literally *anything* is allowed to have an article, you *cannot imagine* how much of a mess Wikipedia would be. Wikipedia isn't a tool for promotion, but for coverage of things people are interested in. Not many people are interested in Joe. Sure, everyone matters in some way, but Obama matters a whole lot more than you and I do, in a global sense. If Wikipedia was filled with Joes, Wikipedia wouldn't be valuable anymore, and it woudn't be manageable.  Everyone would control their own pages, sorting would be a mess, and vandalism and slander would be rampant. It wouldn't be an encyclopedia. The current state of Wikipedia is hard enough to keep reputable as-is.
As for what is deemed significant and what isn't, Wikipedia really doesn't do that. Whether an article is "worthy" is based on whether or not it has received media coverage. That's how you know a subject is something people want to read about, and that's how you can verify information in the article. Wikipedia editors do of course decide if a subject has received enough media coverage to deserve an article, but ultimately, if a subject has adequate media coverage, it gets an article.

[This]( is what it would look like if all donation options were listed up front.
Point being, Wikimedia is going to display the donation options that will attract the strong majority of readers. Bitcoin is not part of the strong majority. As says, the more options there are in the banner, the less of a chance there is that people will donate. The "Other ways to give" link is there for those who want to donate through some other mean.
If bitcoin does show to be a large source of income, then maybe we'll see it in the future ;)

That's not the reasoning at all. No one ever said it wan't "real". At the time bitcoin wasn't significant enough to warrant an article - same as all the other hundreds of altcoins out there that currently don't have articles, and the reason why your neighbor Joe doesn't have an article either.

I wouldn't say they were "anti-bitcoin" as much as they are cautious. From a legal standpoint, there have been all sorts of worries with accepting bitcoin, especially early on. Non-profits especially can't afford to be as risky with their money as corporations can. Just because you find it easy and safe to use bitcoin doesn't mean everyone does.
Now of course, there's less of a worry with more companies accepting bitcoin and the government having more of a stance on it. Wikimedia cited the IRS coming out with their stance as bitcoin as one of the major reasons for accepting bitcoin, and you can't blame them.

Beyond that, if the bitcoin community wants to see a bitcoin banner at the top of the world's 7th most popular website, it has to show that bitcoin is worth it. Wikipedia isn't going to slap the logo up there to pander to a comparatively small minority of people. It's the same reason you don't see info about writing checks - it's not popular.
Wikipedia has professionals analyzing what form of banners bring in the most money. If everyone who wants to donate bitcoin to Wikipedia doesn't because Wikipedia isn't touting the logo around, it's going to be a while before it does.
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:21:43


Very understandable, but I think it's also understandable that Wikimedia took so long to accept Bitcoin. It's been a gray area in terms of legality for years, and non-profits have to be very careful with money and can't take as many "risks" as corporations do. Even the EFF stopped taking Bitcoin for about a year due to unclear legalities.
It did take them a while to accept it, but the important thing is that they did.
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:22:16
I wouldn't really say there's a decent chance at all. Maybe a miniscule one. It's far more likely a company will immediately convert it all to USD - that's what they internally work with, that's what they have to pay their suppliers and employers in, and as much as we love it, who knows where the price will go. Until Dell confirms it (which they probably would for good PR within the Bitcoin community), its safer to say they convert it.
I've only ever read that Overstock immediately coverts all its coin to USD. Do you have a source? I'm curious about it, can't find anything in Google.

You kind of answered your own question with "worldwide encyclopedia". An encyclopedia is supposed to be a comprehensive coverage of anything and everything that is worth writing about. Something being in the real world doesn't suddenly make it significant, nor does it make it necessarily any more significant than works of fiction.

Now I don't have much interest in Star Wars, but clearly there are those that do (er, sometimes a bit too much...)

What reports indicate otherwise? What do you want Google to do? Illegally give out more data about government requests than allowed by the law?
Google publishes [a report]( a report every year) with data regarding government requests for data.

And this is where your arrogance that your thoughts and values are universal, and that what you deem as "worthy" is the only right way, gets you. Kim Kardashian is famous because people like to follow her - maybe *you* don't, but others do. The Wikipedia articles gets thousands of views a day - Kim Kardashian's news, shows, and coverage gets more.
Do I care about Kardashian? No, I think her fame is stupid, just as you appear to do. But that doesn't matter - who are you and I to make that claim when others obviously find her noteworthy? Wikipedia is blind to whether or not someone *deserves* an article based on merit, which is, as I implied, completely subjective. Wikipedia simply looks for whether or not the coverage is out there, which in turn indicates there is interest in the subject.
Just take a second to imagine what it would be like if one could validly argue for the deletion of an article based solely on your subjective rationale.

Not denying that power isn't an issue on Wikipedia (it is in some areas), but I don't see how that applies at all in this case. Wikipedia has clearly defined guidelines on what makes a subject notable; it's being argued that the article subject doesn't meet these guidelines due to a lack of independent and reliable sources. There is no 'leadership' here, and I'm not sure who 'they' is - you're free to contribute to the discussion yourself, and as a matter of fact, the majority of the discussion so far has been from relatively inactive editors.

No it doesn't. The comment said *a lot*. It reads like someone who owns some bitcoin and transacts with it, but it's not something that seems worth investing a significant amount of time or money into.

I don't follow.

Look into 'threshold of originality'. I'm giving a US perspective since that's where I'm from, but simple logos/shapes/text aren't considered creative enough to be copyrighted. The Coca-Cola, logo, for example, can be considered public domain.
This varies country by country; in the UK, for example, they are far more lenient on granting copyright to simple works. Not meeting the threshold of originality also doesn't mean that a name/brand can't be trademarked (which Coca-Cola obviously is, for example).

No, but the proper sourcing does. Besides that, the simplicity of the image makes it ineligible for copyright in the United States anyway.
