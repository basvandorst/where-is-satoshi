I'm asking the Reddit Bitcoin community because, believe it or not, the people that actually understand in depth how Bitcoin works is around this communities. This type of communities are the ones who got Bitcoin to be what it is now.
One of the great characteristics of Bitcoin is that is not attached to any geographical boundaries, so the legal aspect must be international as well. The case of asking a legislator is strongly attached to the country you live in. Your legal context might not be the same as mine.
If you double check the email I got from these people you will see two things: 1. He's citing an article that is almost two years old. We didn't have the coverage and the amount of services accepting Bitcoin at that time and, 2. They're even citing tax evasion and money laundering as an issue for accepting the technologie behind Bitcoin and well, Wordpress and Reddit are accepting them now and they seem to be figuring out these stuff. Money laundering is just ridiculous when you talk about this companies.
The EFF is being really negligent on not supporting Bitcoin just because it has some current flaws that can be fixed, when they should be the ones that push forward for Bitcoin to have a legal context where everyone can work on. A debate that they didn't want to get involved to; a debate that Bitcoin communities are addressing right now.

Wallets on Blockchain are encrypted. Even if the owner types in the password and you pulling the file at that moment will need for you to get the password. That is because the decryption happens only when reading the file and the file is never written back unencrypted.
It would be even harder than breaking into his email if you put into thought that most email services ask for security questions and stuff you can easily figure out.
@_date: 2013-05-18 05:13:01
A couple of months back [I contacted this people]( to review their stance on Bitcoin. Looks like they finally paid attention.
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:19:28
I'm in the middle of sending a bug report, but I wanted it to be public before someone else committed the same mistake. 
It could become a huge deal for Coinbase if that happens.
@_date: 2013-02-08 05:06:31
Really? Do you even know how blockchain.info works? Your wallet get decrypted client side and the password is never sent to the server, that's why they cannot recover your password.
Although you could insert a keylogger in the owner's computer, then you would also get access to credit cards, bank accounts, email and other account's password. This is as secure as most sites can take you.
@_date: 2013-02-23 00:41:58
That's where we come in. We're exponentially growing out of that frame.
@_date: 2013-02-08 02:38:17
Not so easy if the wallet file is encrypted.
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:14:24
Buena info ¡A pasarla!
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:02:37
Haha, I would buy a 100 if it was like that.
@_date: 2013-03-07 05:21:20
Thanks Fred. Let's hope you guys can figure this out soon.
@_date: 2013-02-25 04:41:08
I would throw 100 btc right into the 50% one right away after winning that.
@_date: 2013-02-23 01:18:40
I did, but if they take the time to check them out they will find out pretty soon.
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:26:51
Vitalik Buterin has written about that before.

I bought at $17.00. I was looking for a place to say [FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...](
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:33:55
For convenience [I added some code]( to check for price drops. You can add an expected value and the buy request will be triggered then.
Although I don't think it will help at this moment with everyone trying to buy.
@_date: 2013-02-23 01:04:20
I just replied to them

Welcome Reddit Gold! I just got it with Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:22:45
I sent an email and they replied to me saying that the request is still pending. They pasted the API request on the email they sent me, so I think is time to play the waiting game. 
Did they actually got back at you in the first place?
@_date: 2013-02-08 05:14:01
What pages send you password back to the server?

Cool! I always wanted a Raspberry Pi. I might go ahead and order one myself.

What's is he hating on now? Maybe we should invest in that.

I just tried with Blockexplorer and is showing my balance. Try with 
If you have a wallet backup you can use MultiBit to check your accounts.

Looks like some people is having some trouble with their orders at BitcoinWireless.com.
I found that you can check the status of your order by going to this url: bitcoinwireless.com/status/&lt;order-id&gt;

The perfection in Bitcoin resides in the concept, big software managed by lots of people is always going to have bugs (hopefully just minimal from now on).
@_date: 2013-02-06 06:57:33
The password box is hidden on the html. I made it appear by modifying the styling but it throws an error saying that the password I entered is not the right one. I believe they're not serving the wallets when you do a login request.
On another note, there are no peers connected at all. Let's hope it wasn't a security issue.
@_date: 2013-02-03 08:00:14
Food delivered to my place for sure.
Also I would love to see if someone is living off just by using bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-06 07:00:10
There are no peers connected, and maybe the downloaded blocks are not available for some reason. Still there are other services you can use to check your balance.

The latest version is really buggy

Ok, for Chest 4 I have come up with these ideas:
1. Coordinates are usually expressed as XY points.
2. XY are part of genes (chromosomes) and contained within a cell nucleus.
3. Six = 3 might be "Six".length = 3.
I'm cornered here.
If anyone has anymore thoughts feel free to post. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:08:43
I work with them all the time.
@_date: 2013-02-08 08:17:24
Thanks for the feedback. There was a [post]( a while ago about a guy who successfully beta tested the product. It could also be that they have a manual process to process the transaction. Although is weird to see all the carriers from my country there.
Let's just wait a see if something pops up about this.
@_date: 2013-02-28 02:26:31
Sweet! Is not so far away from where I'm living so I might go there this weekend.
@_date: 2013-02-08 05:32:59
Got your point now. Still, the rule on Bitcoins should be that you only have enough online as you would have dollars on your wallet. But you're right on that flaw.
@_date: 2013-05-16 22:35:23
Anyone got a hint for chest 4?
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:06:06
I just hope you guys make it big in the long term.

Shipping was 200 JPY.
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:18:55
Can you post where to get all the things to do the same in my country?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:43:01


Worst advice ever. 
People, spend your Bitcoins. Build an economy around it or wait for it to become just a speculative failure.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:12:54
The amount of Bitcoins in the address has recently increased, that might mean that someone already got the answer.
@_date: 2013-02-14 00:00:59
Totally legit. You will be very exited when it arrives.
I think they are back ordered until March 7th right now.

There's also [@_date: 2013-02-22 23:44:50
Thanks, I mentioned Coinbase on the first email I sent. I thing they're kind of close minded on this and they're not even looking the state of the art of the Bitcoin community. They're just following the current stance of the EFF on this matter.
Will try to get back at them with your suggestions, I don't have high hopes.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:41:14
So it is more than one word... nice.
