I never explicitly agreed to the Friday price. I got the message about Friday after placing an order for immediate purchase on Monday. It presented the Friday purchase as an option I could cancel before Friday. I tried to cancel on Thursday but could not. And in my Thursday email to Coinbase I in fact told them I wanted to cancel. 
I did learn something from my loss (all of $11). Don't trust Coinbase.

On Thursday I asked Coinbase what I had. I got a patronizing email saying "It looks to me as if that purchase went through at: 1.64 BTC for $1,021.92." I wrote back that I still wanted to cancel the transaction, as I had been promised I could do before Friday, even though Bitcoin was trading above the purchase price. Then Friday morning the website informed me that I had at that moment purchased not 1.64 but 1.33 BTC for the same $1,021.92. I immediately sold it, for an $11 loss. I will ask for this back from Coinbase, but I don't expect to get it. I guess it's a bargain for finding out how incompetent they are.

I got that message too. I logged on today (Thursday) to cancel the transaction, but now my account says that I have purchased bitcoins at the Monday price. In addition, my bank account has been debited. There does not appear to be a way to cancel the transaction. It is still "pending," however, apparently because I will receive the coins tomorrow. I was unable to sell them. If the price drops below my purchase price before I can, I will scream bloody murder. Admittedly, if it stays above I will go away quietly with my profit. Of course, I'm still not totally sure what I have.

Yes, that it was happened. But why affirmatively tell me in two different ways that I have purchased bitcoins at $616? Why then tell erase this from the the record and tell me I have purchased at $755? And why then tell me I had no option to cancel because my price was not set at a future date? At this point I just pray I get my sale proceeds back. 
It is not only my experience that set me against them but what I read from others here and elsewhere. But here I am debating Coinbase. Is there a more reliable alternative?

You might have a point there. From what I read they are OK during calm times. They just fall apart during the rushes.
