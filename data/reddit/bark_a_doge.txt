As a chemical element? No. As a way to measure and distribute wealth? It's terrible.

I didn't downvote you but the reason may be because technically, MTGox's problem really was their own fault. They used a shoddy method to verify transactions and it bit them in the butt. I couldn't say what exactly is going on at Bitstamp and the others right now but a ddos attack does not sound like the issue Gox faced. Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.

I don't know, I was amused. But then my username has 'doge' in it, so, you know..

Greenwald's latest escapades beg the question "independent from what?" I'd call working for the Guardian a hell of a lot more independent than getting into bed with Omidyar. Of course the pay isn't nearly as good.
I'm not expecting The Intercept to become a paragon of journalistic integrity.

If only the BTC 'community' would look at what Doge can do FOR crypto (and hell what it already has done) instead of sneering at anyone that deviates from the libertarian paradise the conspiracy folks are trying to turn it in to. This is why I am more interested in Doge than I am in BTC today. They understand how to bring crypto to the masses.
Note I greatly appreciate all that BTC has accomplished so far. I would love to see any or all cryptos take over from the traditional banks. But there's a difference between taking yourself seriously and being sneering ivory tower elitists.

3 comments so far and you're the only one who seems to have picked up on that.

Well that or pushing propaganda for the publication's owner's ideology. Or ideally both at the same time.

It would cause some kind of shift, certainly, but would it be better? I don't know. The rich could still push many many more coins the way of a journalist and sensationalistic headlines would still draw more eyeballs than any truthful serious reporting.

Have two points of karma back. Sure it was a little pedantic but if we start downvoting folks for being pedantic we might as well all turn off our computers and go do something useful with our time.

Not that I disagree with your last statement but yes for the average user learning all the intricacies of even a standard Bitcoin wallet, let alone how to safely store coins in (and retrieve them from) a paper wallet is orders of magnitude more effort than going to a bank and talking to a rep.
