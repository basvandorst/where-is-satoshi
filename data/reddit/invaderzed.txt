There are only so many transactions that can fit in a block, blocks are created every 10 minutes. There are currently more transactions per 10 minutes than can fit in the block creating a backlog of transactions. This increases transaction times.
Miners put transactions in the block that give them the most money. This creates a bidding war among people trying to send transactions to increase the amount they spend for the transaction to entice miners to include them in the next block. This increases high fees.
Lightning network is a payment network that runs along side bitcoin, you can do several transactions on this network without the transactions having to be put into a block. You still need to do an onchain transaction to enter into the network, but once you are in the network you can send and recieve several transactions without paying for several onchain transactions.
Once the initial rush of on chain transactions to enter into this network have tapered off there will be less on chain transactions being made which will lighten the load on the main bitcoin network leading to lower transaction fees and faster transactions for those who do not want to out bid everyone to get in the newest block.
It is a little more complicated than this but seeings how your obviously very green when it comes to how bitcoin/lightning works this is a simplified explanation for you that you can then do further research on to build a better understanding.

There has been some ransomware going around with a bug where the cartographic key has not been stored.
Some info about it here: 
Be prepared to never get your data back. I am sure you know for future reference you should use better offline backup methods.
Also paying the ransom only promoted this behavior further. There is very little stopping the attacker from targeting you again, especially considering your machine is already compromised. Even if you do manage to get your ecosystem clean of the malware you will remain a target as you will be known as a victim who pays.
I am very sorry to hear about your loss of data.

There are eth, usdt and now neo pairings on various exchanges. That said BTC has far more pairings than other coins and will likely to continue to remain that way for the foreseeable future.

Believe it or not, gun skins. They don't even do anything other than look flashy.

Yes people spend thousands of dollars on these, its utterly insane. All that money just to have a bright blue ak-47 with a yellow dragon painted on it that shoots, plays and sounds exactly like the original.

Forgive me if i am naive, i am trying to understand your points here. If blocks were twice as large wouldn't the attacker need about twice as much spam to fill the block to push people further into the mempool and in effect cost the same to the attacker?

the funny part about that is that they were never redeemable for USD from tether to begin with
