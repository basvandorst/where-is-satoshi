I'm new to this too and I haven't even bought any yet! But I've kept a stock portfolio for a while, so that's the only reason I have an idea of how the taxes works. 
I've read that there are sites that will help you keep track of the cost basis of each of your transactions and the gains/losses involved. The one I came across in my research this morning is called CoinTracking ( but I think there are others out there that do something similar.
As far as your small gains and losses this year, yes you could probably get by not reporting it because it's so minimal, however it may cause problems in the future if you do end up making a lot of money and eventually need to prove what day you first bought your bitcoins, etc. Also if there's money involved, you bet your bottom dollar that the IRS is finding ways to link addresses to real world identities. That might not be something you need to worry about now, but it could be a concern in the future. Bitcoin isn't as anonymous as many people think.

It doesn't matter what the valuation is for the altcoin for this purpose (but you should keep track of it because that forms the cost-basis for that altcoin purchase). What you need to know is the original USD cost basis for the bitcoin and then the USD value of the bitcoin on the day you trade it for an altcoin. The difference between the two values is what counts as your realized gain/loss.

And I'm also guessing the community doesn't want to become well known for tax fraud. It affects the reputation and legitimacy of the currency when viewed by people who aren't hardline libertarians. Cryptos are already known to be used for other shady things like money laundering, drug trade, etc. might as well not add tax fraud on top of that.

Yes, every time you convert a coin to USD, that is a taxable event. If you made a profit on the first trade, then lost money on subsequent trades, you can use the losses to offset any taxes you owe on the first gain.

It means that your long-term capital gains are taxed at 0% and your short term gains (&lt;1 year) are taxed at 10-15% (depending on your tax bracket).

If you haven't exchanged any Bitcoin back into USD, then you don't have anything to report.
If you have exchanged Bitcoin for USD or another crypto, you need to report that on your taxes, whether or not you gained or lost. If you lost, you will not owe any taxes, and you should be able to use those losses to reduce your taxable income and save a small amount of money on taxes.

Yes, in the US, if you bought ripple with bitcoin, that is a taxable transaction. For example, if you originally bought 1 bitcoin for $100 and then exchanged that whole bitcoin for ripple on a day when bitcoin was trading for $1000 - then you would owe capital gains taxes on $900 of 'realized gains.' The amount of taxes you would owe on that transaction would depend on how long you held the original bitcoin (less than one year, or over a year) and your income tax bracket. Some people argue that until 2018, this transaction counts as like-kind transaction, and shouldn't be taxed, but IMO that probably won't hold with the IRS.
Same thing when you convert bitcoin back into USD. Even if you only made $1 in gains, you still need to report that on your tax forms. This also applies if you made a loss, in which case you can use that to reduce your taxable income to a small extent. This is definitely *not* a like-kind exchange, so this is definitely supposed to go on your tax forms. Make sure to read up on first-in-first-out (FIFO) so you can do this part correctly and avoid paying unnecessary taxes.

People daytrade on the normal stock exchanges and get taxed the exact same way. I agree it makes for some very complicated record keeping in order to be tax compliant.

No, technically you should pay capital gains taxes on any amount of realized gains. If your bitcoin appreciated value between buying and selling it, you owe taxes on the gain. How much capital gains tax you owe will depend on your tax bracket and whether or not it was short or long term. If you are in the lowest tax brackets and held your bitcoin for over a year before cashing back to USD, then you might owe 0 taxes on your profit (however you still need to file that information in your tax return).

Thank you! I'm looking to get into crypto currencies and trying to do my research before buying in. There's so much literature and lingo out there, it's quite confusing to a n00b. Maybe your book will help!
