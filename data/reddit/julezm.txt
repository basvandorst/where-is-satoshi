I don't think it does bitcoin's reputation any favors. The average person sees this and there's yet another negative connotation. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:35:44
And some people argue in favor of it. Don't forget that fine breed.

There's a raw sewage joke in there somewhere.

I was frothing at the mouth to buy 10 BTC at $100.00 apiece. Found out that I could only do that with a verified account on both Dwolla and MtGox. 
I could not stop bitching and moaning as I watched it 250. Then 260. So I reckoned that 4 BTC is hardly worth the effort once my account was verified. Today, I still have my $1000.

Fuck PayPal. I can't understand why anybody would even begin considering doing business with them. Especially if you know anything about how they do business. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 00:58:01
Must be since its at $141 today.

Hmm. Where will all their customers go? DHS can't plug all the holy holes in this damn dam. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:52:17
Right. But today(or right now), it's trading at $68.19. I doubt I would've sold at $260 because I'm one of those greedy fuckers that once you see profit, the "money with real value"-part of the equation gets diluted. 
Guess I didn't finish my point. My bad.

That's what just immediately pisses me off. [10 days?]( wtf takes 10 days?

So they need to increase efficiency. The numbers are going the wrong way.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:19:20
Right. So as the average gamer here, your first interaction with the currency was indirect, without your knowledge, and it was used maliciously at your expense to benefit the guy/s who wrote the malware.

A browser plugin that connects your wallet to an encrypted escrow account. So when you view anything in a cart, you can complete the transaction in BTC.

Might be hard to donate bitcoins though. Even if you donate to a Super PAC, they have reporting obligations to fulfill. Unless you don't mind giving up your personal info in the process. 
@_date: 2013-09-19 11:53:03
Well in that case, they failed. Miserably.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:31:40
I'll take some off your hands
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:55:19
There's no doubt about it. I would've waited for it to hit 1000. Even then I would've had a hard time letting it go. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:35:12
I like it. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 03:14:12
Isn't the fear then that if Bitcoin shuns the system and refuses to be integrated, that it will be outlawed? 
If so, then rulings like these are a double edged sword. We like you, you lose. You don't like us, you lose.

Of which he will see [nothing](

I like this. Given Zuckerberg's push to connect the other, unconnected 6 billion, and I think he can pull it off, the place to look for exponential growth is in developing countries. Their potential collective buying power far outweighs anything the US can bring to the table. IMO. 
Of course that will require them to get their shit together, but that's a different discussion altogether.

I'm new to the BitCoin world so please take my observation with a grain of salt.
Isn't having an ATM that turns Bit Coin into regular fiat something that defeats the object of Bit Coin? 
If we're just exchanging one currency for another, I frankly don't see much use.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:10:57
Yeah. For Bullshit. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:58:00
Or crowdfund a brewery with bitcoin. Call it "BitBeer Brewery."
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:25:27
I'm working on it. But I could really use some help integrating with Virtuemart. I'm using BitPay's plugin and I think I'm 99% there but I'm stuck at actually processing a transaction. 
Anybody have any experience in these?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:40:04
See now that makes more sense. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:16:40
Was wondering there for a second if they knew something that I didn't. It was a quick second.
