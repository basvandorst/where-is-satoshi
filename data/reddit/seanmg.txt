How is yesterday any different from any other day in crypto?  It swung a bunch! That happens literally every day.  Also, it’s still up 65% in a month...

Could things like Tether function under a currency that is changing value?  (Skeptical, but genuinely asking)
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:17:23
It sounds like you haven’t done enough research.

When has bitcoin gone down YoY, again?  We’re still up 63% this month alone.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:37:29
Also, a lot of these alt coins couldn’t be adopted by bitcoin as they function entirely differently.
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:54:29
It absolutely is, but calling something a dollar or calling something a bitcoin doesn’t change the hurdles of adoption.
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:06:03
That's a thing I've had to learn through watching everyone ever point out how the trade they made could have been better.  It's definitively always the case that you could have made a better trade.  Take your W's, and learn from your L's. That's all it is.

Bitcoin isn’t for people who have all of those things. Bitcoin is for people who don’t have those things.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:47:38
Y’all are missing the point.  Yeah it’s stupid, but it reads well, and if average joe shmo’s see these sorts of things and infer that countries are backing crypto it does good for adoption.

Why would moving someone’s perception of what something cost to a different metric be huge?
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:06:47
Just because things evolve and change doesn’t mean this guys rationale is bad.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:12:56
Isn’t there concern that it would make the whole system more centralized?
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:53:16
I’m more asking than insinuating.  I don’t know LN well enough. The concept seems promising.

If you ever find yourself arguing semantic you’re missing the point.

Andreas said that was only fan speculation, but he’d be happy to come back.
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:19:04
So you don’t think bridges, roads, transportation, or resources have a positive effect in the economy....?
@_date: 2019-04-20 17:21:47
Lol, Where are you getting your statistics?
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:48:21
Source? I’m curious.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:55:09
You should do some research and get a better confidence level on what what the future of crypto looks to you, now, so you’re prepared for what the market may do.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:41:25
Bitcoin will never increase the block size.

There are solid arguments that PoW are only helping point out our glaringly bad energy sources.  The second we’re using excess solar power of the sun it doesn’t really matter.
Also, there are natural cases were PoW actually increases efficiency.  Example: a power plant that has to run over its own most efficient rate, and instead of having excess energy go to waste they use it to mine, they’re effectively converting extra energy to currency in the ecosystem. It’s really cool.

What is low range or high range to you?
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:56:44
True.  There is a lot that is given up when an attribute like this changes.  Consistency and certainly seem to have more value than convenience (at this point)

What does this offer that other trackers don’t?

133k is not life changing money.  You need almost 10x that before interest makes a dent and you can actually comfortably retire.

not the first dude, but I hated living in AZ.

That’s every market ever.

Not siding with him, but have you seen the chart of the amount of USD printed per year?
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:57:37
It would be worthwhile to compare the number of transactions and (if possible) the number of addresses used to try and gauge the number of users.
I think a slight counter-point is that **despite** the drop from 17k to 4k, the community hasn’t lost faith in its value. That is a big deal.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:02:04
If you’re sitting from the perspective of seeing the incredible value of the technology, this is a great opportunity to clean out bad actors, really clear out of the stigma from the 20k hype, and (hopefully) as a community learn a lesson.  The road is long and was always going to be this bumpy. It always has.  I knew that getting in.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:04:39
That statement is true for every single person on both sides in every single transaction.  It’s meaningless and unrealistic and requires hindsight.
