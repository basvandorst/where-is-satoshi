Can you link me to some of those?  Curious, thanks

Is this post allowed here?  Its about altcoins.  Keep on topic please!

Does this represent some sort of vulnerability in Bitcoin?

Coinbase is a segwit2x supporter.  Same as Bitpay.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:01:29
Aren't most of those Bitpay customers though?  And/Or Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:53:51
I don't think 2x is going to happen

That depends, are you rabidly in support of one side or the other in the scaling debate?  If not, no.  Carry on.

Didn't they add an addendum today that said pretty much that, exactly as requested, and the pull request by theymos moved forward to remove them anyway?

Slush didn't allow signaling of NYA for a long time...

Didn't they add an addendum that did exactly that and the pull request on bitcoin.org moved forward to remove them anyway?
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:06:36
That depends, do you rabidly support one side or the other in the scaling debate?  If not... No, won't be pointless. Carry on as normal.

I think vote.bitcoin.com does what you're talking about, but no one wants to use something Roger owns.
I think everyone in this sub won't support 2x

Yeah but today is a weekend?  Why does it seem to go up midweek and down on weekends?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:23:27


Fees were over $4.50 again today on average... That's hurting some of us.  You're saying fee pressure is necessary for the future, is fee pressure necessary now?  Has someone calculated what level of fees we need to have for protection?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:16:25
Just to clarify... Transaction fees were $4.50 on average again today, and segwit activates in 5 days. Does that mean transaction fees will recover for us immediately?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:36:00
Is that appropriate?
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:26:00
Logical comment!
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:26:35
Nothing is really being "decided."  Its scheduled and the people who support it will fork and the people who don't support it will reject the fork.  The only question remaining is how much of the economy supports each side and how strongly they support it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:19:13


If that's the case, doesn't that imply that they'll stick with the 90+%?
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:17:28
Coinbase did sign the agreement yeah

1password works, but lastpass also works and its' auto-syncing is very convenient.
