Yes, idiocy does seem to be hereditary.

So I was right. You have no videos and are trying to save face. You could save yourself some time and leave this thread in embarrassment.

Look at all those words but no videos. Show me videos. All the videos you've got.
Edit: If you make me ask a third time, I'm going to assume that you're bullshitting me. Currently, I believe that's exactly what you're doing. Less with the chatting and more with the videos.

You do argue dishonestly.

If I'm going to look stupid, why won't you just post the damn videos? Don't you want me to look stupid?
You are completely full of shit. Maybe in the future you could stop making such absolutely absurd assertions when you can't back them up. If you keep doing this, don't be shocked when someone calls you out on your stupidity.

I like how you conveniently ignore the second half of the article, wherein she got back much more money than the officer took and how the court smacked the officer down. This is much like how you ignored the evidence that the police shot that one guy in self-defense just because it didn't suit your narrative.
Guy, if you want people to take anything you say seriously, you should lay off the hyperbole and stop posting sensationalist bullshit.

Wait wait wait wait wait, hold on a moment. Are you throwaway-o on a new account? That would completely explain the absolute garbage you keep spewing. Yet more evidence that nothing you say should be taken seriously.
If you're not him, you do a great impersonation. You guys should team up and cover the world with your stupid nonsense.

Ahahahahahahahahahaha, this statement is hilarious coming from you. I've proven beyond all doubt that you are an extremely dishonest person who cares nothing about truth at all. And yet you say this with a straight face.
Maybe you should try a career in comedy.

Of course the conversation is conveniently documented; that's why I posted it, you dumb fuck. If you think *I* am the one who looks dishonest in that thread then you are completely divorced from reality.
So it took you a week to come up with some videos in a desperate attempt to make you seem like less of a liar and *this* is all you come up with? That people go to prison for tax evasion? And that police shot a guy (in self-defense) who was known to attack police officers in the past and was threatening to attack them again?
The *full* video is linked there, not your carefully edited, dishonest version.
At best, you're posting sensationalist nonsense. It's more likely, though, that you purposely lie out of your ass in flailing attempts to save yourself in conversations that start going south on you.

Actually, yes, I do deny it. I would, in fact, like video evidence. Let's see what you got.
