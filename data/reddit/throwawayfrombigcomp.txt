Fully 23% of the subreddit is non-U.S.  Libertarianism is not a national ideology by any chance.

They did not choose it.  They were never given any choice.  The word to describe what you're referring to is called either "resignation" (for those who pay quietly) or "Stockholm Syndrome" (for those who defend their captors who would punish them if they refused to pay).

This is basically what you are saying.  Now you need to explain why pot is being legalized.

Bitcoin is most definitely a libertarian technology.  *Everything* about Bitcoin [is deliberately highly opinionated in favor of libertarian solutions to social problems](  Satoshi himself said *literally* that he brought Bitcoin to the world to advance the cause of freedom.  Sounds very libertarian to me.
Do pro-state people use Bitcoin?  Of course they do -- whether it's because they are greedy or because they think they can pervert Bitcoin to serve statist interests, it doesn't matter, they do use Bitcoin.  And, insofar as they use Bitcoin, they advance the cause of freedom, whether they realize that goes against what they believe to be their interests or not.

Also, these people are **not elected**.  None of them are.  None.  Every single one of them was hired by an agency whose recruiters and approvers were **not elected**.  Yet somehow they get to pass laws that can ruin Bitcoin businesses?
How much more proof do people need that it's all a sham, a racket, democracy has been (for a looooong time) an absolute fiction?

Shit.  This is not good.  If the Swiss are doing this, that means the war on cash is truly global now.

Government puts the people running the service in prison?
That's usually how they get their way.

Ooooh, he didn't have the magical permission slip, BLAME HIM FOR WHAT WAS DONE TO HIM!!!

Bah, there is no "opposed to what".  Your cultlike beliefs in papers and rituals are retarded *independent* of any alternatives.
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:12:13
Ah, it's the rituals that make the signatures magic.  Understood, carry on with your kult.

It's not "fine" to punish people for exchanging value consensually with one another.
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:22:21
People who had harmed no one were executed there.  Let's not joke about that.

At the very least all nonaggressive activities.
