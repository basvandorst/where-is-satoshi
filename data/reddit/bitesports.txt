No questions, just wanted to say thank you for keeping a nice discussion/argument and keeping it civil.

There’s more and more people having part of their savings in btc, but there isn’t much adoption for use yet, this is a combination of things, lack of tools, lack of clarity from regulation, etc 
Ultimately, the problem in Argentina is that culturally there’s an attachement to USD as the store of value, not even gold is that popular. Through many economic crisis, people have flock to the dollar, that’s why in the slightest feeling of economic downturn, the dollar blows up. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:10:52
A lot of people do this, after the corralito specially, ‘corralito’ was basically the government in 2001 saying, you can only withdraw 100usd a day from your bank account, to prevent a bank run. 
Almost 99% of the people I know keep their savings in dollars under a mattress. Most transactions are done under the table, even for buying property. 
But when this administration started they did a lot of things well, released the dollar peg, brought stability into the market. So must of the run now, it’s not made by the little guy, this has been big players doing businesses and affecting the little guy. 
Although as I said, it’s a cultural thing, I don’t believe (and I might be wrong) that small savers cause this, this was institutional money playing the stock market. 
Government as also been pushing a lot for people to put their money in the banking system, by giving tax exemptions, and through combining databases to track infractors. Funny note, my mom got an email from the local tax org (IRS) saying that given her monthly salary, it was strange she didn’t have a cleaning lady, so telling her she had to declare it. spoiler: my mom cleans her own house 
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:47:42
I know, it’s the Argentinian version, I was trying to explain it to people with something they know 
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:08:59
Haha funny that you picked that video, it’s literally where I live, the tiny place in a big ass country! And you picked correctly. 
The thing with the ‘saqueos’ (ppl breaking into a supermarket) at this stage, is that they’re organized, that’s not a natural response from the public, that was organized by groups trying to destroy the government, I assure you it hasn’t got to that point yet, it might, and I lived through the 2001 crisis, but that’s just the same that happens every year, someone trying to make a point.
The outlook in terms of economic measures taken by the government doesn’t look good, added to what you said, there was a drought this year, so a lot of the cash coming from the harvest disappeared, added to that, the land owners are not liquidating the dollars that they made with the harvest, speculating with a higher price, so there’s no sell offers of dollars made on the market.
Government spending doubled in the past 2 years. So, only way to cut inflation at this point is to give a strong indication of cutting spending and fuck knows about IMF 
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:06:21
Yeah, this things come in circles around here, and people remember from the last time it happened, whoever bought dollars did well. This is not ancient history, it’s my parents. 
So it naturally flocks to that, you’re bombarded every day on every tv channel about the price of the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 08:35:33
I’m from Argentina AMA lol
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:04:11
I’ve been actually traveling for the last 2 weeks, but based on what my parents and friends say, people is afraid, and angry. Ppl supporting previous government are taking the time to bash the current administration and calling for protests, and all sort of things.
Peoples saving and salaries got destroyed over last week, so everyone is waiting to see what the government will do today and tomorrow to stop the dollar spiral, and reduce the spending. 
Reducing spending comes with big political cost, and macri (the president) doesn’t have much right now. So it’ll be a tricky week.
One part of the country is blaming the previous administration for what happened, meaning they did some shady deals to make the government look bad, another is blaming J.P. Morgan and all for what happened, and the last basically knows this what bound to happen and just did. 
On a day to day, everything more expensive, loss of consumer power, angry people.

I think that's the mind set for some of the investors backing 21inc. Just pure old speculation
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:26:21

For what i can tell, it’s a hardware wallet similar to trezor, that you can use to program different smart cards to be used as a single account, or as a 2 of 3 signature.
Honestly this is terrible marketing information.

Can we return anonymously to crypto? Or is it like magic thing? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 10:58:00
It’s semi controlled right now. Because the government has funds from the IMF, and they can hold the boat for a while, but they need to reduce spending.
Not similar to Venezuela, but it could happen. Really depends on this week.

We're trying to expand as fast as we can, we're adding the option in a little bit so anyone can spread bitcoin locations in the map so we can all together expand the reach of the app

@_date: 2014-04-03 18:19:07
When you download the app, you'll see bitcoins hidden around your area, which you can collect by going to the location with your mobile. There will be different types of treasures, with different values hidden inside them which you have to unlock by playing a mini game.
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:35:07
Thanks! we're launching city by city for the first couple of months until we're ready for going worldwide.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:08:49
you can give us a hand! coinding.com we´re not looking for an investment, but people will be able to donate for certain regions. Basically is a global treasure hunt game based on your gps location. We (and anyone) will be able to spread free btc or create challenges in exchance for btc that people can collect around their city. We´ll launch in april in a location still to be decided, but if you´re interested you can always help creating challenges for your city!
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:58:05
I think the open letter from Erik Voorhees sumarized the best answer i've heard for this questions, the example about languages as a transfer of knowledge is a good explination i've noticed.

As an argentinian, trust me, this is just starting
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:49:27
Hey thanks for the good luck wishes. There're really a lot of ways to monetize something like this when it starts growing.
-Keeping a small fraction of the prizes offered for challenges that people makes, shops can also use this in the future to help people discover where they are located, although is not our idea to start with advertising from the beginning.
-People doing challenges for themselves, let say you run everyday, we spread btc in the area where you run for a monthly fee, if you go out every day you get your fee back, if not it goes to the site.
-The donations are going to be going straight to the cities, we would not keep comission there, but we've already had a lot of people interested in helping out in their own town. 
Anyways, there're lots of ways to make an income from an idea like this, without ruinning the fun ;)

Hi there, Argentinian here aswell. I have a btc startup not related to the wine industry, but i'm from Mendoza (the wine region) and im friend with all of the major wineries and distributers over here so i can make the conections if you're interested. Exporting is difficult yes, but there's a lot of companies doing it, so it wouldnt be a problem. I'll explain bitcoins to them for you ;)
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:34:36
can you lock the btc funds for each btc purchase until the time when the return period is over?
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:08:23
Just look at this, and then quit if you still want

A friend of mine is one of the top players in the world, i got him into btc, and told him to talk with the big crypto poker sites for a sponsorship oportunity, since someone arriving to the final table with gear from the site is a very very good marketing hole in one. They offered him 100 bucks and a hat....
There's not enough money going into it yet.
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:18:27
Depends on which country you're at. Coinbase and circle are very good. If not available for you (it isn't for me) you can try localbitcoins where you'll be able to buy using a bank account or cash in person. If not, try your country biggest Facebook Bitcoin group, normally there are a lot of resources.

I know a lot of poker pro poker players, and have tried them to play with bitcoin. But all of the systems out there right now charge a very high rake on the tables as well as playing with very small decimal places is confusing for them.
Just a though for you to improve 
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:58:30
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:42:11
I truly respect what you're doing. And I think there's a lot of people in the forum that fail to see individual backgrounds. You have a life, and you decide what's best based on your day to day decisions. It's important to understand how everyone is living this rollecoster. 
One thing that the community is overlooking in my opinion, with this price swings, it's the startups that were founded around February, March this year. We don't have time and also can't day trade to stay above the wave. We believe in btc, and work every day to make it better. But we've suffered a massive capital loss with this, and we're still here. Still working. Because it's important, and I can see it.
So everyone thinking that the price swing it's important or not, it's right and wrong at the same time. Because that depends on you.
Let's just keep moving
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:32:33

Sure, It's a treasure hunt, similar to geocaching but with bitcoins. When you install the app you'll see bitcoins spread around your area, in order to collect them you have to go to the location with your mobile, and then solve a small puzzle. We're trying to get people involved, and learn, about bitcoin by playing games. When you withdraw your profits, we'll explain things like wallets, addresses and 2FA. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 20:52:12

@_date: 2015-01-15 17:05:52
The biggest problem in Argentina is not only the fees. But since we have around 50% inflation a year (unofficial numbers) if you get payed by cc only to receive your deposit at the end of the month, you're loosing a big chunk of money.
Also, many of the brick and mortar shops prefer to handle cash only payments, since most of our economy deals under the table, because the taxes combined with inflation makes it almost impossible for businesses to succeed.

@_date: 2016-01-03 22:59:16
It will be very different depending on the person, and on how Bitcoin looks like in the future. But like Internet, the profound change won't come from everyone understanding how it works, it comes from the fact that people will reconsider what they think money IS. I only started in 2013 without a fintech background and I still think this is the biggest change it has made for me.

I think people are looking at it in absolute terms, time wise. 
As a startup that's coming out of beta, even if they had money they couldn't and possibly didn't want to produce thousand of this beta product. 
A 400usd price assures you as a company that the people buying your limited stock is actually interested in doing development with it. Because that's what they are, a Dev kit. 
If you look at the people who gives them the investing money, like Qualcomm, they do chips, and they will embed chips in devices in the future. 
This dev kit allowes you to develop early for that future that they are building.
If you take a look at Balajis history, he likes to create a complete vertical in the market that he enters, like his biotech company, so i truly know that they didn't just made a mistake on the price point.

This is a dumb poll unless you xpost it to other sides of the debate. If not its a silly bubble silo

For someone making such claims and talking about collusion and connections, saying "It was an impression i got from something i read a few weeks ago but i'm not sure exactly what it was." as a basis for one of your claims it's insane. I assign it to ignorance though, instead of malice, which is what you're implying by most of this people.

You should try Blockspring, it changed my life! 
You can use it with google sheets and excell. Basically it's an addon that allows you to add info into your spreadsheet coming from different API's 
Very powerful

Hey man, I think what you're trying to do is a good concept. I was in a conference recently were big people in the bitcoin industry were talking about doing an anual meeting of the influential businesses in the bitcoin community. I think this is what you're refering to? I dont have links or anything, im just letting you know that if this is what you're talking about, get on with the research and contact some key people to see how you can help. If it's not then sorry :P
