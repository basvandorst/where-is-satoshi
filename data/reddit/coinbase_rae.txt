[Rae from Coinbase]( here. Sorry to hear you're having trouble with verifying your bank account.  The issue you describe could be caused by either the bank lumping together the 2 small deposits or that the second deposit hasn't completed yet (it takes 3-5 days to get to your bank).  Either way, calling your bank will help to get those 2 amounts.  If you have any further questions, please reach out to us at support+reddit Thanks!

[Rae from Coinbase]( here. Sorry to hear about the missing deposit.  If this was sent via overnight ACH, this may be the reason why you do not see it on your account as we do not support this type of transaction for now.  You will need to ask your bank to reclaim the funds in this case.  If this was sent via wire, please make sure that all the necessary information such as the reference number is included to ensure that the wire deposit is matched to your account. We have reached out to you for more information regarding your case.  Thanks!
