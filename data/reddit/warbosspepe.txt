Good man on the video Jack! I actually never heard of DarkCoin, seems like theres an altcoin being developed for everyones needs at the moment.
Would it be safer to say that all these alt coins may "piggyback" on the Bitcoin infrastructure, say as being different types of tools in a tool box?
What im imagining here is an ATM thats converts your wealth into any altcoin you require for a particular transaction or need. If this is the case this may hinder the market cap on Bitcoin depending on whats the most prevalent need in the market at any given time...
I suppose im trying to see similarities between the Cryptocurrency Market and the Precious Metals Market

Thats the facility it brings when you're registered with coinbase.
For outside-US users, we have to use either a QR code or paste the Bitcoin address. Not that its in anyway majorly difficult, but may not be as straightforward for an everyday user.

Do QZ have an agenda against Bitcoin? They previously made a claim, and are now using it as a fact in this article

Probably a very simple question.... but how come it states 


can anyone answer that?

Is it worth the listen?

Are they really turning an enormous profit?
The prices on the road seem (at least to me) incredibly low, even with the constantly fluctuating coin prices

Wow thanks. Never even heard about that type before
@_date: 2013-03-05 13:03:36
Can anybody ELI5 why these prices are escalating so rapidly?

Yeah i can see Bitcoins dominating the news for a while now. 
Just curious how Litecoins will hold up considering they're designed to be more efficient to mine and transfer
