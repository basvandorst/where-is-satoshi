That’s a bad analogy because Costco still takes other credit cards. Does valve take other cryptocurrencies?

Doubled his profit would be technically correct once it went up two cents. That doesn’t make what he was trying to say any less incorrect.

I’m implying the fact that it being owned by Coinbase adds to the benefit of using gdax as well lol? You use the same account for both and can move funds freely between the two.

You would still need to get the funds from your wallet onto the exchange in order to swap currencies would you not?

The government regulating an exchange still has nothing to do with free speech

Uh what? Free speech has nothing to do with whether the US can regulate bitcoin.
