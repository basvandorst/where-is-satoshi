1. *Cyprus
2. Nobody heard of, or if they did, would have cared about BTC during that period over there. 
The corresponding price rise was done from the international market looking at the overall situation in the finance sector and the precedent it set , not Cypriot citizens. I would confidently say that no more than 3 individuals on that whole island bought even 0.01 BTC during that 2 weeks, or the period after. 
Put this out there for the sake of clarifying an all too common misconception.

Did I say this? Did I mention anything about what he wrote? I clearly referred to a series of interactions I had with him in the past that led me to conclude he is indeed a goof, and irresponsible in the way he analyzes things in general.
Stop putting words in my mouth.
And he is pragmatic? ok, your opinion but I strongly disagree.

whats so difficult with Lclbitcoins? I also live in the middle of nowhere but have had no issues. Find a seller from any country in the world that does a west union or moneygram transfer. It doesnt have to be "local". Of course there is a premium, but if you need some BTC asap, thats the way to go.

@_date: 2014-09-18 22:32:04
Not at all. I was just specifically referring to that particular service. For example it allowed me to purchase BTC without having to go through the normal companies and get a feel for it. I didnt mind paying a premium for the experience.
Goods and services are a different story. At the end of the day we all agree that the process should be made simpler.

Dear Superintendent Lawsky and General Counsel Syracuse,
I’m writing you today to express my deep concerns about the “BitLicense” proposal. The current
framework threatens the privacy of virtual currency users, innovators, and researchers. In particular:
1. The BitLicense is extremely broad, requiring licenses for far more than just money services.
2. It infringes on the privacy rights of individual users. Companies that obtain a BitLicense could be
forced to collect identifying data on account holders and end users including full name and physical
address. This information will be kept on file for 10 years in case the government seeks it. So while
individual users may not need a BitLicense, their privacy will be seriously affected.
3. It forces virtual currency innovators to undergo rigorous background checks and submit fingerprints
to state and federal law enforcement. This will create a barrier to entry for start ups and inventors
looking to create new services.
4. The proposal as written raises First Amendment concerns.
It’s premature to craft regulations for an industry that’s so new and still in flux. Bitcoin and similar
virtual currencies are still in their infancy, and we don’t yet know what new tools and services might be
created. This regulatory proposal could cut that innovation off at the knees, before we have a chance to
see the potential societal benefits.
The NY DFS is letting the fear of money laundering drive a massive regulatory proposal forward that
would affect users who are doing nothing wrong. NY DFS should respect the privacy of technology
users, and limit its regulation to what is proportionate to the real threat at hand.

@_date: 2014-11-27 23:36:55
What the hell are you talking about. Stop saying things off the top of your head to just validate your pre concieved notions. What a stupid statement. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 06:13:49
Very true. I do think that the possibility of the ECB following a "bail in" strategy with other struggling EU nations in the future did have a psychological impact for some in in the international market, but you are correct it was probably minuscule. 
This Cyprus trope didnt make sense from the beginning. There were capitol controls, even within the internal banking sector, moving money abroad was completely impossible, and the maximum people could withdraw from ATMs was 250euro which they were using to feed themselves, not send money abroad (which again, was impossible) to buy BTC.
And most importantly, nobody knew about BTC (and still dont), or cared (more important things to worry about-was the family's life savings gone)
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:44:10
Thanks for the tip but keep it. You will need it if those old white men who historically built up society to the levels you are enjoying today go to the wayside.

@_date: 2014-10-05 17:24:53
ahhh David, welcome back. And once again, your analysis is laughable. I certainly was not supportive of vertpay. What I took issue was people, like you, who were drowning in hysteria like a middle aged woman based on no information. You are the one who made that community venomous. Mod? who the hell cares what a mod says. YOU were called out by the devs for doing this. You started acting like you were some sort of superstar and making hourly threads about "what I think about...". 
And by the way, those devs and people behind vertpay are head devs at Monero.
I reiterate, you are a goof. Nobody gives a shit what you think. Everything you touch turns to shit.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:12:35
sure. But local bitcoins sellers have a built in premium anyways. But the example I used was if you want a way to get BTC quickly and want to avoid setting up accounts etc.

Absolutely. Sub 100 is what I am waiting for to move in a substantial way. 200-1000 price range I am simply not interested in from a speculative standpoint.

@_date: 2015-01-11 14:51:14
Just stop it. This post is lame. 
Andreas broke the rules. Simply as that. Shadowbanning for this type of thing is common site wide, and I see it all the time. And usually its resolved after a few back and forths with admins if violation was done unintentionally. As was done here
"this made me puke". How about you learn the procedures and terms of a site before resorting to witch hunting and blaming other people for someones unintentional error. Grow up.

He is living on Earth while you seem to have your brain fried by the radiation on Mercury's surface.
What valuable use cases are there at the moment right now that would entice the general public to go through the trouble of converting fiat to btc for goods and services. Less than the fingers on my left hand. 
He was talking real use cases.

My popcorn bill is going to be off the charts this week
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:20:10
ya. I deleted the thread. Pointless anyway, probably bullshit. Meh, whatevs
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:20:33
Popcorn ready
* Former dev gave ultimatum to owners of Evolution to return stolen funds, or face unmasking.
* The deadline has passed. Says he is in touch with Verto (founder) and that since funds have not been released he is proceeding.
* Says info dump is imminent.
* Obey Reddit rules and dont post personal info please if he ends up doing it. 
* The thread linked is for popcorn purposes only. 
* **Disclaimer: This guy either is legit, or one hell of a dedicated troll who has been hitting the meth pipe for the last 24h. No endorsement of legitimacy as of now. Dont hold me to it. We will know shortly.**
Will update as things progress. Its a long thread for newcomers to read.
**Edit 1:** supposed chat log of the conversations.  Seems fishy, awaiting more dumps.
**Edit 2:** Many people asking for further proof he was a former dev. OP posted some screens showing he has/had backdoor access. Awaiting confirmation on the voracity of the screens.
**Edit 3:** Thread has been removed. This has happened twice the last 24 hours but came back up shortly after. Mods are being careful about doxxing and posting onion sites (which he just did). ......................... Tic Tok
**Edit 4:** Needless to say, the mods over there are cautious about this. The backstory is that OP was in contact with mods to provide further proof of legitimecy. Seems it has not been done yet. 
Mod post: *Nope. Sorry. I'm pulling the plug. If you are who you claim you are you would have been able to satisfy gwern's request long ago. Your reply is nonsense. Please come back if you can show even a modicum of proof otherwise we ask that you go troll another community.* 
Ill keep following for a bit longer. Here is OPS u/n for you to judge his post history: [user](
**Edit 4:** below kept a pastebin of OPs original post. Check it out. Op is saying he is still working on it (In his defense it is a somewhat complicated matter, or alternatively he is full of shit) and will run further info through the mods over there first...
**Edit 5:** These are the alleged screens "proving" op had initial backdoor access to Evolution. Its important because it would verify his claim about knowing the admins of the site, and subsequently either being able to pressure them to return funds, or dox them to authorities. [imugr]( [imugr2]( Cheap fakes or legit?
**Edit 6:** Just got back. here is a more accurate post of the original [thread](
**Edit 7:** Im out, but there seems to be a lot of drama happening behind the scenes on various forum's. Too much for me to keep up with. Someone else take over. Thanks for the entertainment Dark market people.

so you basically made a confident statement above, based on an admitted assumption. You are literally an intellectual dolt. 
And your first post was completely wrong by the way.

No. &gt;120,000 BTc has Not moved the last 2 days 
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:35:00
Jesus Christ. No shit. But you are speculating that that was done which there is no evidence for. Was the last 2 days volume substantially higher than the previous week or so, or were there irregular or suspicious patterns that would merit you suggesting 120.000 coins were funneled through? No.
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:47:01
Its  certainly not verified, but the best number to go by for now.

I hit my head on the desk when i read this


*implying keeping the head in the sand stops the public from focusing on something*


Whatevs. Think what you want. Its not my job to show you the flaws in your logic
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:06:12
Old admin threatening to dox those that stole the btc unless they are returned. One hour deadline. They are in discussions. 
Edit: 10 minutes to go. Either Op of that thread is one of the better trolls, or there will be fireworks.
Edit: Its the deadline (2est). If no updates in 20 minutes Ill delete the thread and assume troll.
Edit: apparently one of the owners has now been doxxed. Cannot vouch for authenticity or any thing and will not repost, but that's the latest I have seen. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:22:08


It wasnt 43k. It was over 100k
As far as the rest of what you said, no, they couldn't have washed it. Are you telling me that somehow they managed to process the coins on multiple echanges, each requiring varying degrees of verification and kyc? That would be laughable. Dont be naive
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:14:44
*Sigh* Let me spell this out
* what do you think the impact of 120,000 coins flooding the market over the next two years will be
* What do you think the public perception will continue to be with more high profile situations like this occurring
* What do you think the demand will be short term for a significant portion of bitcoin purchasers
There are at least 5 more bullet points on how this is relevant to the entire ecosytem if you just got your head out of the sand. This is not a "drug dealer" story, that has little to do with it

lol. Honeypot for what?
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:46:12


Lol. Good job in pulling that straight from your ass. Wrong.


So then its possible, but I still think its unlikely.
Either way, the OP on that thread is either going to attempt to restore funds, or will doxx owners of evolution, if in fact he is legit. Time will tell. Either way its fireworks.
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:36:21
I didnt really ask for your opinion though.
I first made a statement implying your analytic skills are abhorrent.
You replied.
