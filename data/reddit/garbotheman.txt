You'd need to pay tax either way. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:49:39
Yeah it can take hours and sometimes even a day or two.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:22:27
Yes, all you have to do is turn on your stove on the highest setting and put your head on it. It's a secret bitcoin giveaway I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:03:16
Do your own research.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:04:28
Glad I could help :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:48:02
3m seems overly optimistic

Well, no one knows for sure since the Model T isn't out for consumer use just yet but I'd assume as time goes on better hardware comes out. I'd say it's a safe bet to assume the model T will be better than the first model but won't know for sure until early 2018 when it's supposed to be released.

All that's going through my mind right now is "drop drop drop drop drop" so I can buy more at the dip :P

Just to be safe I'd change your password. Better safe than sorry mate.

Good plan, I'm going the "put down a little amount of money every week" route as it seems to be the safest way to creep my way to 1btc. Gl fellow hodler:)
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:35:53
Yes, you wait for someone to buy it but it's usually instant.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:31:37
Mmmm look at that beautiful curve.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:04
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:28:28
Instead of getting out entirely, put it into an alt coin. Then if/when there is a dip just buy back.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:25:50
Well whoever owned that portfolio must be very happy these days.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:56:04
Np man, don't want you to end up like that guy who lost 100k this past week.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:43:47
The Ledger Nano S is very user friendly and nice on the eyes but has limited amount of memory which is kind of a huge bummer. Therefore personally, I'd choose a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:15:36
Hodl till 200k!
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:58:03
Coinbase is linked to the account you create so if you lose your phone that's fine (unless someone accesses your lost phone and sees that you are still logged in coinbase which is a whole other story) because you can log into your coinbase account from another computer or phone. Be wary that there are some verifications you have to go through to link a bank account. When you link your bank account, transactions take a couple days to process so there will be some waiting time. You can use your credit card to buy bitcoins however there is quite a large fee to buy using a credit card but your bitcoin purchase is instant.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:12:33
If your putting 10k I'd suggest getting a Trezor over a ledger as the ledger nano s can only hold 5 bitcoins max. Also, for beginners, coinbase is probably the best. Very user friendly albeit the fees are abit high but I believe it's negligible.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:56:08
Hide your balance friend, it's on the top right corner of the app :)

Ask your local cartel boss.

I understand it's very nerve racking but bitcoin takes quite awhile to transfer. Take deep breaths and just give it a few hours, maybe even wait till tomorrow. If it hasn't gone through in 24 hours then something's wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:00:41
Yes, put all your money into it then sell all your material possessions and put that towards bitcoin as well. Also, take out loans to put into bitcoin.
Reason? Because it'll go up forever.
Hint: I'm kidding. DYOR
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:23:24
Any amount is just fine, honestly put whatever you can afford to put into bitcoin knowing you might never get it back. It's all a risk but say bitcoin prices double meaning your investment doubles. I'd be very happy seeing 200 dollars in my account vs. 30 dollars (if i had invested 15 dollars) in the end it's just about how much you are willing to risk. Hope that helps :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:09:38
A lot of first timers seem to like putting down $50. Personally I'd put down at least $100
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:57:33
That's up to you but I'm doing the same thing as you and I put my money into Ltc. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:22:25
The biggest downside is probably the high fees associated with coinbase. Some other exchanges that are good are binance, bittrex, kraken, shapeshift. Honestly, for ease of use and accessibility and security there's nothing wrong with coinbase if you don't minds paying a little extra on fees
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:29:07
Well are you willing to lose 800 dollars? That is the true question.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:18:52
Enjoy the little things in life. Bitcoin is the future but you gotta treat yourself from time to time ;)
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:14:07
I'm fairly sure it takes some time for it to pop up on blockchain 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:48:40
If you use coinbase i realized the ID verification through the app on your phone is easier than troughs your pc. For some reason the PC verification hardly works.

Coinbase is an exchange just a very beginner friendly one as they only have three currencies. If you're planning on only investing in bitcoin then Coinbase is definitely a good way to go. Regarding backing up your coins, your coins are technically not yours as they are on the exchange. You can look into different online wallets or cold wallets where you can actually "own" your bitcoins via private keys. Sorry if this sounds complicated, not the best at explaining things :/
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:37:52
Coinbase also makes money off of selling you bitcoin at a higher price than actual market value.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:04:40
At this point, bitcoin can go anywhere. To answer your original question is it too late to join in on bitcoin? It's never too late. Are you gonna become a millionaire from 250 dollars? No, but like some other people have already said, it's not unrealistic to think that you can double or even triple your investment in a couple years maybe even a couple months. In the end it's your decision but know that when you invest you should go in knowing that your investment can become nothing.
