A good point i found is, even if they make bitcoin easy to acquire and has small advantages like avoiding banks, save a small amount and safety, i believe people still wont move to btc, because think of exercise, its easy, has many small benefits and yet people still dont do it because of being lazy.
i absolutely LOVE bitcoin but im not going to be like the complete idiots who think BTC is better than everything else and we cant question it.

How i feel as they slowly become obsolete.

its somewhere around 1-3% that the retailers save i believe by accepting a BTC transaction rather than visa/mastercard however even if they were to pass that 1-3% onto the buyer, is it really worth the time linking a bank account, getting verified, depositing and getting btc? AND then the exchange wants a fee of like 1-3% aswell!

besides getting the Bitcoin word out there, we really need to help direct people to the better exchanges, i think GOX is the first place a lot of new comers go to and get sucked in, resulting in a turn off to Bitcoins just like in this case

I'd much rather HODL my bitcoins than hold her 32" D's...

i really like the idea of doge coin being a de facto reddit tipping coin, not to try pump up the value but because it would just fit into the reddit environment so well.

Truely sorry to hear and i see it as news which is worth posting about for all the new comers. BFL screwed over so many people and were laughing to the bank the whole way. I wish the worst on BFL and i have no understanding on who the hell keeps buying their products.
Even the new ASIC Scrypt Mining companies are hugeeeee rip offs in price and delivery time, and yet people are still going to be sucked in a purchase them...
