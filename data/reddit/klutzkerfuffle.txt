You have to consume a real world resource to balance incentives and make the system go.
You shouldn't really have thoughts until you do some basic research.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:13:53
Keep studying and you may get it.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:17:27
That's just one part of it. Bitcoin is difficult to change on purpose. Bitcoin is what we get with a used, decentralized currency taking it's own path.
If Bitcoin was easy to change, then there would be more features and "better" performance as you measure it.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:27:02


If there is a shortage of canned chili and the price goes up, that is not inflation. If everyone wants a Tickle Me Elmo and they are willing to pay $200 for one, that's not inflation.
Inflation only occurs when more currency is created. This makes more dollars chasing the same number of goods and the price goes up. That's inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:53:17
That stuff isn't even necessary for Bitcoin to continue it's dominance.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:46:42
That bot was compromised recently and people lost money.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:32:05
Lol! Woosh. Nice one.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:29:29
That wasn't me. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:34:00
That's sick. Keep the screenshot/proof so you can show your grandkids.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:43:12
It's not practical but people do it all day every day.
This is incoherent drivel.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:50:17
Which precious metal is going to dethrone gold?
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:13:37


What if there are no new "sheeps," but the current ones buy more? Hodler benefits. So your statement is false.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:43:55
Run a full node. Also, you can test everything they release.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:34:20
Please tell me how the banks are better at international remittance. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:24:47
Keeps it cheap so we can accumulate more. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:20:20
Thanks for sharing and sorry about your luck.
Memorizing seed phrases is a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:55:29
Keep researching and thinking. Your "insight" isn't valuable.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:38:49
That's what you hope. But it won't happen like that. Impatient bcashers will get what's coming to them.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:30:21
Bitcoin has a 21 million cap. I wouldn't worry about inflation.
Don't use it for coffee if you don't want to. Hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:27:54
Sounds decent. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:18:30
Yes. Move your BTC. Load your private keys into a BCash wallet. Send to an exchange and sell.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:45:57
Yes it will be.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:56:11
The most useful thing about blockchain is censorship resistance. This requires trustlessness and decentralization. Bitcoin is the most trustless and decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:29:10
What is cheap and reliable? Those are subjective things that you are assigning to math problems. If you pay more sat/byte, then it will go through.
Maybe those sat/byte were a cheap price to pay compared to their alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:36:26
That's how we signal to each other that Bitcoin has value. If we were lukewarm about it, how would that help worldwide adoption? You can't see the forest for the trees.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:56:31
I don't. There's no guarantee that these guys will be good stewards of blockspace, but they at least haven't proven they won't, like Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:52:55
You'll get it eventually. You will probably be very bitter and possibly too late. Hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:20:26
There's a problem. Bitcoin is about disintermediation. Bitcoin kills off financial services businesses and many others. The money-making incentives don't always align with user incentives. That creates a little bit of a gap in user experience compared to businesses that are making a profit off of you. 
It's like they can give us 90%, but we have to go the last 10% ourselves to get the most benefit. I think there will always be extra that can be done by power users.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:27:03
Yeah I noticed that
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:52:53
Top tip: take a look at the article next time before you offer your opinion on it.


She will be doing customer relations. What do you think she will be doing?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:28:40
Be mad at governments for manipulation of the energy market. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:48:04
Totally agree. Anyone seriously discussing fees usually will mention sat/byte too.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:42:11
No. It's not important to "realize" that because it's not even true. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:58:45
How about starve out the organized crime syndicates by not paying taxes, hiding gains, etc?
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:20:07
Nope. Hodling works. Hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:03:24
Good on you man! Good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:27:13
Defaulting would be great. Like Bitconnect, but it will be the assholes who bought government bonds losing their ass.
@_date: 2018-01-28 00:50:01
Maybe they won't be much better in the end, but let's put it through it's paces. 
You have to wait for them to approve your DL. My cash transfer was instant. Maybe your bank is blocking at their end?
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:33:10
Hodling is using. Make hodlers.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:10:48
Decentralization. Trustlessness is the is the reason to use blockchains. We are tired of counterparty risk. You cannot have trustlessness with centralization. The alts are 99.99% junk.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:00:22
Go find a copy of whatever Satoshi forked from and see if you can get people on board.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:23:11
You should be in marketing
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:58:28
I agree. They're squatting on good handles. Not sure what can be done.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:15:27
Bitcoin is cashing out. It's money.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:13:45
You won't find better "governance."
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:28:24
It is relatively easy to create a coin with a trillion dollar market cap. Or even a market cap approaching infinity or whatever. 
It's not a series of sprints where one athlete can become faster than another. It's an ultramarathon with deadly traps and obstacles. Bitcoin is miles into the race while the alts haven't started. Many of them can't even walk, much less run or clear obstacles.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:53:52
I am still happy with 500k if that's accurate.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:58:14
You can store it in your brain. Storage is not a problem.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:09:35


Sounds like folks need to be more savvy users of the system. Honestly this is half of it. People have to get better about taking care if they want to manage their wealth trustlessly. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:56:00
Some people may want to use the cash app.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:15:10
It is never efficient when you have to use the thteat of deadly force to do it. This is not a reasonable post.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:17:54
Yes it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:44:58
Honestly you need to keep researching.
It's a balance of technical and economic understanding. The US Constitution is set up to be inefficient. If you think back to political science 101 and remember the reasons for inefficiency, then you are on track to understand Bitcoin eventually.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:09:24
No coins for sale. All hodled.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:31:30
You didn't pay enough.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:00
Bitcoin is doing the best of any top 15 coin.
Bitcoin is the hodlers coin. The hodlers coin will moon the hardest and have smaller dips.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:45:26
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:25:20
Your statement presupposes that one must "cash out" into fiat at some point. I have the bitcoin that can be exchanged for goods and services. I am already cashed out into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:08:33
Hodl is the best advice I have received.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:15:34
Yessssss. I thought it was bullshit, but it's happening. Guess what is a trend? Veganism and vegetarianism. Guess who has beans? Taco Bell. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:31:16
I think Bitcoin is cheap for international remittance.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:05:03
People are learning to ration themselves. Businesses are learning to transact smarter. This is a really good thing imo.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:19:22
Seems as on topic as this one. Strange.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:56:11
Try these steps in order. 
* Power cycle, 
* Uninstall/reinstall
* Read everything before you click so you don't accidentally block something
Usually helps me.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:54:16
Buy all the time and hodl. Buy urgently during dips like right now.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:57:10
Then why don't you do some more research?
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:27:04
Someone should build actual casino gaming machines that use lightning network.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:46:45
Good one. Everybody needs that trustlessness.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:39:12
You weren't hemorrhaging money with Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:30:04
Nope. They're shit. They will always go down with bitcoin, but they won't always moon with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:16:23
Ok. You hodl the inflationary currency and I will hodl the deflationary currency. See. It doesn't work. It's inevitable that there is a fixed supply currency with this technology. People want to put their value there.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:11:22
Then what's the right way in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:38:20
Friend, let me introduce you to Austrian Economics. Mises.org is a good start and resource.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:11:25
At first I thought you misspelled Fritos.
Fritos are a delicious corn based snack food in the USA. Some people like to eat it with chili.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:35:40
Yeah I think all of the forks should be listed in alphabetical order.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:30:41
You need to read up on how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:33:10
No. Bitcoin is the Wright Brothers. Altcoins are like different designs that haven't been tested yet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:25:22
DoE makes people dumber.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:15:28
Bitcoin will really have to take a shit for me to be down. Hodling is great. You should try it sometime.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:11:24
Government gangsters do make antifragile systems unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:34:26
Sounds like it was sized properly.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:45:21
For a merchant, it's rational to accept whatever and however the customer wants to pay. The merchant can then convert to bitcoin for savings and banking. Any altcoin can be digital cash. Just don't keep cash. Keep it in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:49:03
If there was a sound dollar, Bitcoin would have a harder time catching on.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:12:14
That stuff is nothing compared to what bitcoin has been through recently.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:41:49
Wow Ethan's into cryptocurrency. Hilarious.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:32:01
They were enjoying it too much. Screw 'em.
Liking this schadenfreude.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:15:05
Coinbase hates bitcoin and loves alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:14:01
No. It would totally help in a complete anarchy situation. Trustless currency without a leader is great for complete anarchy.
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:34:22
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:12:31
You need to go read some mises.org. Forget all that junk you have been fed.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:14:23
He should have said "from us." I haven't heard of problems buying bitcoin with BoA.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:52:21
FOMO for normal people. Awesome.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:07:03
He has no answer because it's baseless fud
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:45:50
Interesting article. He has a lot of interesting facts. His conclusion doesn't make any sense because we know that power corrupts. Bitcoin has always been about arming the sheep, not replacing the tyrants.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:33:21


Bitcoin is practical for international remittance among other things.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:46:04
Eth doesn't scale. It's a nonstarter
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:44:01
You should read mises.org. It may help you understand some things.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:45:04
Because it's all bullshit. ADA and everything else. 
We are tired of the corruptible paper law world and are ready to usher in the age of governance by immutable ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:59:58
Bitcoin only. Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:45:17
Screw that Bitcoin Core stuff. 
There's only one Bitcoin. I would not purchase this game.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:41:21
None of us living will see the end of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:48:50
Yeah there's a cash card that you can order through the app.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:22:47
Why don't they just start doing the right thing? Instead they want to try to convince us that they are doing the right things.
Sorry Brian. Still going to call out shadiness.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:12:12
Do you hodl bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:07:26
It's just available today for some folks.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:48:34
Beeeeeeeeeeeecaaaaaaaashh! Woo!
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:31:43
Wondering when this sham would resurface.
You didn't lose bitcoin. This is a lie to get us to click your link.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:28:51
It won't be easy for the first users, but it'll get easier. Plus, this is Bitcoin and financial sovereignty, so things won't always be polished at the beginning.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:52:45
Good goals and good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:08:10
No it won't
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:30:08
News today is just the propaganda arm of the powers that be. Bitcoin will starve out the powers that be, so their propaganda machine will die too.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:39:44
Username checks out
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:24:48
It's not a problem. It's the way a gold rush works. There is no other way it should be.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:50:46
I don't even know how to buy gold.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:36:25
Layer 2 solutions. Consolidate when you can.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:23:55
Solid suggestion
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:22:07
The Federal Reserve is not centuries old at least.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:13:49
You sound like a moron running around telling people to vote. It's because you don't understand.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:35:37
Thanks. I will keep that in mind for diversification. Maybe 95% BTC and 5% precious metals.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:18:01
It doesn't because they don't have Austrian Economics backing them up. This is the ideology part.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:13:22
Well that's like your opinion man
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:36:06
Nah. She's the real deal and one of the good guys. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:41:37
$35 for international transfers
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:46:38
Wow. The article was ok, but that statement at the end was awesome. Bitcoin is coming.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:54:05
It's scarce and highly treasured already. It will become only more so. Hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:28:04
Doesn't seem like an extra risk.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:29:39
Public capital projects always destroy more capital than they create. Seriously. It would take a while for me to explain, so if you are interested at all, I would recommend doing some reading at mises.org.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:29:29
Your wallet can get the bitcoin balances from your own node. Samourai wallet has a setting to do so.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:52:18
Where can I find that kinda discussion??
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:31:32
SexWit. Missed a marketing opportunity.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:08:39
Fees are not $5.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:51:11
Terrible advice. Once someone starts to understand, they understand why it's Bitcoin only. You are in pre-understanding mode.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:42:19
I think you can even hook it to your own node, I believe. That's my next project.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:33:39
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:56:44
Why don't you attempt to understand instead of relying on the herd? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:56:56


Anarchy means no leader
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:24:21
What are your goals?
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:30:48
You have to enable it in the settings. You can send it out.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:03:07
These are paid shills drumming up FUD. Yeah you are correct.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:20:33
Sounds fun
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:31:18
Yeah man. Absolutely. I don't work for them. Honestly the cash app seems a lot more simple and easier than Coinbase for newbies. Plus no alts to add to the confusion.
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:17:02
The banks can accept a little bit of risk because they can put you in the negatives if they need to.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:14:05
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:52:30
He must have been high on something good.

[This]( is OP. 
(The one who finds the ticket.)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:29:17
Satoshi is God
Ross Ulbricht is Jesus

Adam Bach is John the Baptist
Jamie Dimon is Pontias Pilate
All I got
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:06:46
More geographic areas is good!
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:38:27
I think he got this idea from me posting on r/BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:03:47

Wtf Alaska

@_date: 2018-01-29 01:33:20
It just friggin denied me for a purchase. Then it worked fine on Coinbase FML.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:32:24
Less of a potential than any other cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:20:12
Why don't we go the other way? Why not pass laws against harassment in general? I hate it when I say hello to a passerby and they give me stank face. They should be sentenced to some community engagement classes.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:26:21
You can point your wallet to your node for a fully trustless system.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:26:12
Yes it can
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:22:01
Of course there are. My statement was hypothetical. I was showing him that the price of bitcoin can grow without new buyers. This makes his statement false.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:56:39
Are you asking why they are the "wrong people?"
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:59:51
You need to keep thinking. Blockspace is a finite resource. Bitcoin is dealing with reality and scaling. You want to yell about fees that are less than banks.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:54:10
I like the simple design of number 3.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:49:39
It's all relative man. Getting in the game only cost $600 a year ago. 
A guy like you back then would have said 50 BTC was in.
@_date: 2018-01-06 12:19:38
That's a good one. 
I would say that Bitcoin is specific water molecules traveling the pipes. To stop them, you would have to turn off the entire flow of water.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:21:11
Scrape that hippie shit off your lip.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:06:17
Thanks for letting people know.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:32:43
Transaction fees are measured in sat/byte. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:23:36
Exactly. Diversified means they'll fall for anything.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:04:48
People are being good stewards of blockspace. This is a good thing.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:02:40
How long do you think Bitcoin can last? 400 years? If it's 400 years, then it would be five times an 80 year lifespan. Gestation is nine months and infancy is about two years. So that would be about 14 years for a 400 year old lifespan.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:33:11
You are making FUD
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:41:24
I can tell you that people aren't spending their bitcoin right now. I would pretty much forget about doing it that way.
I would suggest learning how to accept lightning network payments, which are bitcoin payments. I doubt that many people will be ready to pay that way, but it could be good publicity.
My best advice is to accept any and every currency that the customer wants to use and hodl your wealth in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:19:01
What would you say? Maybe 10% are illegitimate?
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:40:08
Yeah good point. It's easy to make Bitcoin lose dominance, but not as easy to dethrone Bitcoin from 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:21:03
Figure out a clever workaround, create a technical solution, or pay the fee.

What?? Inflation is an increase in the money supply. You have been lied to.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:59:49
Right. As a bounty.
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:49:12
What a judgey person. You are doing great
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:17:27
Wow. Thanks for the education
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:44:29
Look long term.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:30:55
The loss comes from fiat currencies, not from other Bitcoin buyers.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:18:53
Same here. Let's go next year when bcash ain't a thing.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:26:12
Lightning Network will compete with PayPal.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:23:04
How would they get it in there to sell? I doubt that people will be able to send bitcoin to Robinhood.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:23:54
Good one. I tell people that I am a libertarian because I don't trust people with life and death decisions for me.
When a person votes, they are consenting to someone having life or death power over them. 
People say "oh, I don't trust people enough to live in a land without laws." I say it's the opposite!
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:45:34
Go straight to Satoshis. It's the best way imo. Become a future Satoshi millionaire for only $153.00.

Everyone is a successful trader until they aren't. Divining rods and tea leaves.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:07:31
Be careful with that
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:53:18
Nah. You have it all wrong. No one owes you cheap fees. Unless you were working on LN this whole time, then you should be patient and appreciative.
@_date: 2018-01-09 05:32:00
Because they want muh-ney. Money. They want your money and if you give them any excuse, they'll take it from you.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:23:29
All good. Judge not lest ye be judged.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:17:36
Yeah. Maybe it's FUD because it's not applicable to Bitcoin in many people's eyes. It has to do with the old system. Our bitcoin are safe, so ..
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:24:30
Use this chart. Pick your custom fee amount.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:56:37
Yep. Grandkids for sure.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:49:33
No. Bitcoin is outside the traditional systems.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:49:19
What is going to be the economic incentive to use LN on BCash?
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:18:33
Taxation is theft! Fuck them.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:27:04
Great post. You are exactly right that this should be celebrated.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:16:47


It's *fleshed out.*

OP's title says Customer Relations.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:57:10
You can ask customer service to let you in.

It's not pride. It's confidence in the technology and philosophy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:31:02
Pragmatism is too subjective when it comes to life and death. Every regulation is backed by violence. I don't want someone else's ideas of pragmatism to end my life. 
Only principles should be used in life or death situations. Principles like the Non-Aggression Principle.
Therefore I reject all government action on principle. Calls to pragmatism don't change principles. I don't trust my fellow human to make life or death decisions for me based on how pragmatic they can make it sound to someone else.
I do my best to treat my fellow man in a principled way and I encourage others to do the same.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:59:13
Yep. I would rather lose my money than not be on this train.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:24:48
I can vouch that sentinel on Google play works well. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:20:47
Nah. I take care of myself and my family. I have Bitcoin because it is my desire to not participate in your murderous, destructive system. It is my exit from sharing risk with fools and cattle.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:28:54
Bitcoin can't go down when enough people genuinely believe that. Think about it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:53:52
He should make the buyer pay in Bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:20:20
Roger is a Bitcoin hodler lol. He knows his Bitcoin is super valuable and will be in the future. If he didn't believe in Bitcoin he would sell it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:05:41
My advice is to get verified and regularly use at least two exchanges. Then you will have a backup.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:23:48
I have my BTC, so my gains are realized lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:46:50
If that's true, look at your peers in college. They have debt and you have savings.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:52:49
I can’t wait. They have to buy before they can sell, and I will gladly accept their cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:41
Everybody wants the best.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:15:24
Interesting read. 
Bitcoin isn't the bubble. It's the pin.

I thought about him yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:20:47
A few of us are here to change the world. That's why people sometimes have a hard time getting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:12
Feel bad. Remember this feeling next time you want to click the sell button.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:55:25
Not even they can steal Bitcoin keys out of someone's head. They have to give it to them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:52
There's also the use case of Bitcoin smart contracts with Rootstock.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:28:15
It goes right to it when you click it
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:56:53
Not everyone "knows" that.
I think the current bitcoin development is going in the right direction. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:41:38
It's already happened. 
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but what is done cannot be undone. To make something else the peg would require a time machine.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:31:23
Here's my best advice.
Earn it. 
Do whatever you can for international clients and accept bitcoin. If that is not feasible, then you would have to get creative.
For instance, could you buy a vacation at the beach and sell it to foreigners for bitcoin at a discount? 
If you want to invest smaller amounts, you could do the same deal as above but going in on it with friends and relatives.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:00:19
Thanks. You deserve it too if you keep hodling strong.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:28:00

$1.00 USD just took a nose dive to 8200 SAT. Been hovering around 8800 for days.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:35:42
All of this requires imagination and really thinking outside the box. This is just like the early days of the internet.
If you are interested in the idea of political diversification, I recommend reading and watching Doug Casey.
Instead of selling for fiat, I plan to spend my Bitcoin. Houses, businesses, and other big ticket items are for sale around the world already.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:46:27
If they were smart, they would peg it to bitcoin like the dollar was pegged to gold.
But never in a bazillion years would they do that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:27
Then you're part of the problem. Thanks for promoting and hodling the currency that makes all your idiotic ideas impossible. The whole point of this is to starve out the government and banks so they can't steal from us, do war, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:27:01
Bad for the Bitcoin trader usually. Just trying to save people from themselves. If they don't listen, then best of luck.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:40:21
Marine, you need to put everything you've got into Bitcoin. Read Mises.org. Watch Andreas Antonopolous. See if you can watch Doug Casey.
There's a whole new world out here. Best of luck and SF
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:16:46
Yeah sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:59:24
Yeah I can see it.

Ooh yeah talk dirty to me.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:53:33
If everyone stopped believing in it, it would be over.
Government is just in our heads. The trees and rocks don't know they are American. My dogs don't believe that they are in America.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:54:25
Succinct and effective
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:39:43
Good point. People have to be forced to do it with fee pressure.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:29:46


You aren't seeing the reasons, but they are valid.
Hodling a deflationary currency can do crazy things. People start to recognize it as valuable. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:59:36
Yes you are right. There are a few. I bet all of the hardcore alt hodlers equal about 1% of the bitcoin hodlers.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:08:45
They have to misrepresent to make it make any sense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:52
Why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:15:22
This is a shame.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:33:17
Basically Free. You know what I mean.
Bitcoin for SoV, LN for MoE.
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:59:45
You need to keep thinking. Blockspace is a finite resource. Bitcoin is dealing with reality and scaling. You want to yell about fees that are less than banks.
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:45:44
I will help. I think the idea of creating Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Legacy, Old Bitcoin, Original Bitcoin, Pre-Fork Bitcoin, 1MB Bitcoin....
All of them lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:32:16
Yep. That was for them. Rock on.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:38:05
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:39:35
I would choose Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:10:18
How betting on Bitcoin is turning big profits 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:05:53
Unfortunately I have to unless I want to get dead or in a cage.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:41:42
Everyone could realize that USD is worth noting too.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:54:45
You have to use your wildest imaginative dreams to ever come close to predicting what Bitcoin will be and do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:08:04
No. Screw them. Begging them for consideration helps validate their "authority."
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:06:11
People are fleeing alts for real money. They don't want to miss out, so they cut and run from the alts at the first sign of danger or missing out.
Bitcoin's killer app is the increase in price. We have this because we have the best hodlers and dip buyers. We also have the most.
Now with Lightning Network demos it's getting really exciting.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:41:59
Yeah man. Hodl strong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:55
I believe that the hodl memes help because it reminds people to hodl.
Why would you say that it doesn't help?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:31:32
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:52:10
Just buy what is a decent but trivial amount just to practice using and watching. I bought $100.
I don't believe that you were randomly sent money. Did your Bitcoin balance change in there? If not, then that extra $30 is probably the increase in value of your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:55:21
1 star and report to Google as a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:26:58
What a bunch of idiots.
They need to relax and keep their mouths shut lol.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:10:14
An ever-expanding blocksize is not a temporary fix or permanent solution in any way. It simply makes the problem worse.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:24:15
Please explain. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:25:08
If we need laws to save us from Roger, then bitcoin has failed.
We don't need the gubmint to lock him up.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:37:49
No. We don't want spam transactions. There has to be a fee market.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:01:02
I agree with all that. I was pissed at them. As far as SegWit, if the customers start leaving because of fees, then they will activate it really quick.
They’re just so damn convenient for newbies.
Some of us recommend it for that reason. Especially non nerds... They need Coinbase to start. Better for them than sitting on the sidelines.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:40:28
We didn't always have income taxes and we won't always have income taxes. 
The government wants us to think that "That’s how it’s always worked and how it will always work."
That was my point. Bitcoin will help us destroy the system hopefully. The more people believe, the more likely it will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:55:33
Exactly. Government is a Ponzi scheme, especially social security.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:58:29
Honestly if one of the alts overtook Bitcoin, it would expose the warts of that coin, and it would tank really hard. It's much much more likely that Bitcoin remains King with the most gains.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:16:32
Ok thanks for letting me know
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:49:30
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:01:18


My drunk what? You're the one who can't type.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:39:16
Maybe something different could take its place.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:38
Just make sure you hodl it, and any price around December 2017 should be good. Just don't wait. Get on in there.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:36:54
Buying and hodling is exactly what poor people need to do. Everyone does, actually.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:40:39
There are no problems with hodl. You just have a problem that you wish you would have hodled. 
The correct move today is still to hodl. Buy, hodl, Be patient.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:00
Yep. The mars shot of 2018 will begin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:34:35
If it really sucks, people will do something.
Also, I believe that folks need to learn lessons. They have to get uncomfortable sometimes for that to happen. It's like layers of an onion. With this meddling gone, if there's an issue, we can see it to fix it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:05:23
Fuck LTC too. Fuck them all except for the one true king.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:24
Now jump back on board. You need a boat.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:11
The real transfer of wealth hasn't begun yet imo.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:36:35
Right on.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:28:31
No. By supporting the government meddling in the internet, you are complicit.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:05:55
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:06:13
Which alt do you support?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:16:15
If you prefer the current system, then you should get out of Bitcoin and root against it.
I don't want or need the government's "help." Their help does more harm than good.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:00:53
There has to be a simple, unifying meme. Embrace it and do all the other stuff in your post.
I would have lost money without being bombarded with hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:44:55
Shopify has interest in promoting their Shopify Payments. Any upgrades will have to come through the bitpay app. Unless you can do something custom.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:22:57
I literally laughed out loud. You are probably right lol.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:47:59


What this means in this situation is that for true decentralization, blocksize must be capped eventually. Imagine Bcash having this conversation about limiting blocksize in about three years. It will be ugly.
Bitcoin is getting this stuff out of the way while we are still small. Forward thinkers!

@_date: 2017-12-03 16:06:54
I am willing to dispute it. I am doing that right now.
I would definitely choose my battles with the government, and that's why I starve them out with Bitcoin. I want to choose the battlefield and the rules, not them. And I have different levels of success. Small victories along the way are enough to sustain me in the struggle against coercion, aggression, fraud, propaganda, and war.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:19:44
Yeah they received a mortal blow the day Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. The State can try to minimize the wound, but it's fatal.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:13:54
Bitcoin has a lot more than first mover. If that was the case, there would be no new coins in the top ten.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:58:25
That's impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:35
That came from a random redditor on here. I have been repeating this since last night. Getting this into the public consciousness.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:51:15
I must be really dumb because I have no idea what you are talking about
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:32:25
Of course.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:30:12
This is the use case for Bitcoin. It is the safest place on the planet to keep your money. 
Come hell or high water, I will have my bitcoin. I can take them to my grave if I want. I can't say that for anything else. 
The one year idea is just to help with psychological hurdles during this bumpy ride to adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:26:10
You are correct
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:50:44
This is a new thing for society. We are reinforcing this change in behavior. Everyone has been conditioned to spend fiat, and we are helping to get the hodl mentality into the world.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:57
Lightning Network and maybe decentralized exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:01:03
That stuff is called Technical Analysis and it really doesn't apply to the bitcoin price. It's generally considered to be snake oil.
You are doing great. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:23
I like having roads and medicine too. We will have more roads and more medicine when the government stops fucking with people. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:19:58
You thought wrong because you either didn't research enough or are not smart enough. This is expected to anyone that gets it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:37:54
So if it comes out in a couple of months and is badass, what then? Bye BCH, LTC, and many other alts. Poof.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:39:15
Bad logic. It's the very beginning.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:54:05
No. That was an awesome interview. They get it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:24
Nice one. I may steal that prediction, tell my family and friends, and look like a god.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:09
I hope you learned from this experience. �� Alts are bad m'kay?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:02:01
It's hodl.. H O D L
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:04:52
Maybe. But my own time is valuable, so probably not. It's degrading to vote anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:32:27
This is a dumbass post. 
You already live in the post apocalyptic world.
Bitcoin will get us out. People will produce, save and consume more without people stealing from us and distorting markets.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:56:55
The hodl memes and price memes are here to help you.
At first it seems childish, but when it finally clicks, you will love them. Buy the dips. Dollar cost average. Hodl. Never sell. Spend one day. Support decentralization and resistant intermediaries. It's that simple. This recipe has made many millionaires and will make exponentially more before it's done.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:14:15
That's because you are not a moron.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:38:12
I guess just ignore layer 2 completely and spread FUD. Glad you are here.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:39:25
Why not run a full node and use a HW wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:52:05
No, no, and no.
First of all, deregulation is good. Secondly, no this deregulation will not be detrimental to Bitcoin in any way. Thirdly, if we need a gubmint law to make bitcoin exist, then it's a failed experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:44:53
Yes. Long term hodlers usually get it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:47:09
Right here and aantonop on YouTube. Also, download Coinbase and get some skin in the game. It'll help you guide your research and give you some urgency.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:56:23
Money is most useful when it is most popular. So it has the most worth.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:04:34
Good luck man
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:17:58
Memorize your seed. Brain wallet.
I think your bitcoin will be worth hundreds of millions. Get a hardware wallet, generate the private key, send your bitcoin there. Memorize the 12-24 words. Wipe the hardware wallet and practice restoring it. Practice with small amounts first. Wipe everything and burn everything and just remember the words. 
Just an idea. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:34:42
Yes. Right on. I don't think it'll take you a decade though!
I would rather lose it than have not invested, so I am right here with you.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:39:17
Yeah but you get it that the hodl memes carried us, right?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:41:35
No. Your analysis is baseless.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:05:04
Yes I am American and I agree with you about that part. Think about that video though for real.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:37:20
It's not about the most gadgets, dumbass.

If they knew what it was, they would be shooting us in the streets
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:55:08
Why not buy? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:35:29
Doesn't really even make sense.
If you found out that a defibrillator is even more valuable as something else, then why not do it?

No. It will settle in bitcoin transactions. The other transactions will not be on the BTC blockchain.


That will be up to the card provider to make it economically feasible if they want to do it.


Bitcoin is the store. The settlement layer. Even if they never moved, ever, you could point to them as a store of value. Like the tribe with the stone at the bottom of the pond. 
Bitcoin shouldn’t move around a lot. I encourage you to keep reading and keep engaging. Learn something new every day.

BCH is centralized in many ways.
1. Fewer nodes. The few that they have are run in Ali Baba servers
2. No consensus required as long as the miners are down.
3. Blockchain bloat makes it tougher for a regular Joe to run a node. They will need specialized facilities.
4. They have like one or two devs and they have already had a disagreement and published stuff that one of them thought sucked.
5. They will probably up the 21m limit. Miners have to get paid and they won't allow a fee market to develop.

Alright man. You didn’t leave much content in your original comment. You just called him an idiot for saying that nothing can kill Bitcoin, which is fine as a working hypothesis. Because it’s basically true. Especially now that we have satellites in space.
Of course an Extinction Level Event on Earth could wipe out Bitcoin. He didn’t mean that, and everyone knows it.
So because of your antipathy towards a genuine holder, I just assumed that you either don’t hodl Bitcoin, hold altcoins, or are just a FUDder.

@_date: 2017-12-09 03:02:49
These are good calculations. 
It reminds me of when I read *Basic Economics* by Thomas Sowell. In one chapter he talks about price gouging laws. For instance hotels during a flood. The people who get there first get a room for $99. So the parents get a room, the grandma gets a room, and the kids get a room. When the next family comes, there are no rooms available at any price and they sleep in their cars. 
If the hotel is allowed to "price gouge" and charge $300 per room, then the first family decides to get one room and the kids sleep on the floor. The second family that comes up has a room available.

BTC has the most and most die-hard hodlers. That's the killer app that makes Bitcoin the most valuable network and cryptocurrency.
When you have the most people that believe it will be a million per bitcoin, that's a self-fulfilling prophecy because they ain't selling at $20k, $100k, etc. And they are willing to wait.
All the other cryptocurrencies know that this is happening so there are few hodlers that wouldn't eventually jump for a mooning BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:37:48
It's coming. Hodl.

@_date: 2017-12-02 15:13:52
I will be blunt and tell you that you are very wrong. 
All currencies require trust. Bitcoin is the most trusted cryptocurrency. We have the most enthusiastic hodlers and dip buyers. It has survived the test of time.
Bitcoin is getting Hugh Glass as a guide. There is a lot of demand for Hugh Glass. Altcoins are like getting a rookie guide with a GPS device and space blanket, or another rookie guide with tons of MREs. Hugh Glass can go get the gear at any time. Rookie guides must go through everything to get where Hugh Glass is. Most will die trying.
Layer 2 isn't about giving Hugh Glass some new gear. Layer 2 is replicating Hugh so that he can take each person through the woods individually.
The price rise is Bitcoin's "killer app" for mass adoption. BCH's killer app is fast transactions. Hmmm... Which one is going to catch on in society faster? Which one is going to make more money for investors? 
People want real savings accounts that aren't at the whim of the establishment. Bitcoin is the hardest to kill of any cryptocurrency due to the decentralization.

The reason that we are here today is because people have confidence that Bitcoin is the future. More people believing every day is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
This post is actively working against our belief that Bitcoin is the future backbone of the financial system. He is unwittingly working as an agent of the powers that be.

Exactly. The ancaps and libertarians will be early adopters and all those government lovers/trusters will be poorer in comparison.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:16:52
Very narrow definition of adoption. Hodling is the ultimate adoption. It tells each other and the world that Bitcoin is worth good money. That's the most important thing, especially if you are looking for value increases.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:19
Great post. You could always sell all forks to get more Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:09:02
Might not need the blockchain for too much longer. I just try to have imagination. 
However, the fact that it could get going at any time would be an important incentive somewhere in that system.
Currencies evolve in this way... Collectible, Store of Value, Medium of Exchange, Unit of Account. 
We don’t need instant, no-fee transactions on the blockchain today. We need a censorship resistant store of value (a savings account) today. We don’t need better cash and credit cards. We need better central banks. Bitcoin is the trustless central bank that will put the others out of business. I just made that analogy up.]
Not trying to be condescending. Trying to be motivating to someone with whom I probably agree with on 99% of things. These conversations are good.
Edit: It’s a rival, new-comer central bank. Bitcoin has to be ready for the onslaught, whatever that is. Therefore, I don’t care about anything but the most basic spendability right now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:15:22

The government has the power to go into your bank accounts and take money out. They will not have this power with Bitcoin. 
They will claim that this will lead to more crime because they won't be able to enforce their anti-money laundering laws. There will be a scare campaign about drugs, terrorism, human trafficking, and probably pedophilia. They will smear and call us unpatriotic.
I think by the time the government does something, it will be too late. Also, it would behoove an individual to make sure that you are as mobile as possible so that you can go somewhere else if shit hits the fan. There will always be some place that will welcome rich bitcoiners just like countries sell passports and citizenship to high net worth individuals.

Adoption is people buying and hodling too. This means bitcoin has value.
Your private keys are getting more and more valuable in the eyes of your fellow man. They can't steal it from you other than through coercion it out of you. People are learning this and they want some.
That is definitely adoption in my mind.

First off, the whole concept of speculation is moral, efficient, and beneficial to the economy, despite what they teach in school.
A successful speculator helps move resources towards good ventures with a high likelihood of success. A successful speculator also helps speed up the demise of unprofitable ventures by moving value away in the form of short selling. The speculator is rewarded when his or her predictions come true and incurs losses when he or she is wrong. Good businesses, ventures, and currencies can grow faster and bad ones can fail faster.
Do some people speculate? Yes. Do some just love the tech? Yes. Do some have to use Bitcoin out of necessity? Yes. Curiosity? Yes.
What does that matter? Speculation is a fine, moral act.
Now as far as “bubble.” Bubbles are caused when there is some government action or some unknown piece(s) of information. With the open source nature of Bitcoin, I think this is about as good as it gets. The governments are not doing Bitcoin any favors, so we know that it’s not market distortion from government.
So I guess it’s just people’s enthusiasm. It’s just that tons of people believe that Bitcoin will be the future and put their labor/goods/money where their mouth is when they get Bitcoin. Evidence of this is the current market cap and the price.
You make a prediction on the future value of your dollar when you hodl it for any period of time. If you had any doubt about your dollar’s (general) worth tomorrow, you would spend them today. 
I make that same prediction with Bitcoin. Because I predict that it will be more dear in the future, I accumulate them. This is a normal market action, no matter how many people are doing it.
One day some number of people will believe that Bitcoin will last longer than the USD, and it will be a tipping point. I want to have a lot of Bitcoin when that tipping point happens because I will have something that people want and I can live well. Incidentally, the world will be changed with less theft and financial shenanigans.

Let's let our brains get better at seeing scams. When people lose their asses, they learn it real good. They also have less resources to waste on scams. 
Let's be savvy humans. Let's not be sheep. If we want to get the full value out of a human and humanity, people have to be responsible for their actions.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:54
So many people waiting for the dip makes it not happen.
I think this is *price discovery*
$16,000? That's not the price lol Maybe $10,000,000. Hodl! This will kill fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:47:12
I suggest just buying the bitcoin. You will do better.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:33:30

You can't sell for fiat and hodl at the same time.
You didn't hodl and you will probably wish you did.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:36
That's why it hasn't "corrected" down. People like you are really looking for dips.
Right now, Bitcoin is correcting up. It's price discovery.

They would go bonkers at $12k. For real. And I think that mental minimum will keep going up and trailing behind but close to the current price.

Not to mention the armies of dip buyers.
This is a land grab. Better get a portion.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:54:22
Governments and central banks will be starved out by Bitcoin. If they continue to exist, they won't have the means to wage war. Bitcoin makes it harder to tax, so it will increase costs of tax collection and decrease revenue. Governments are already at the brink.
Financial intermediaries will go away and do something productive.
This will happen because people will believe that it can happen and then they will believe that it will happen, and then they will believe it is happening.
It's really a mind shift and attitude change. Bullies should not be celebrated. It's not ok to choose one bully over another because they will bully you less.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:45:36
I hope it doesn't come to that, but that is likely.

Why does USD have value? Belief that it will have value tomorrow.
How will Bitcoin adoption continue? Belief that it is the future of the financial system.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:26:11
Yeah more and more value is being secured in Bitcoin at a rapid rate. Bitcoin is used to store $270 billion today. This is an increase in adoption from the $10 billion that were stored in Bitcoin last year. People are storing more and more value in Bitcoin every day. The adoption is right in front of your eyes. You just can't see it because it's not how you expected it to happen, or it may clash with some idea in your head that you just can't let go.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:33:37

SegWit is kinda like the canary in the coal mine. If it's still at 10% adoption, then the fees are bearable.

Why do any of us want Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:21:27
No. Sometimes by blind luck the system will get some things right.
Self defense and retaliation are not aggression.
I like to daydream about everyone having a drone that follows them around providing protection. Loyal only to the individual. This would not be allowed to exist under the current system. The drone would attack cops. To get past violence as a species we have to get past laws.

No. That's not how it works. Fees will be enough incentive for miners to mine.

The excerpt was awesome. He addresses this.


I want the coin that makes the main thing the main thing. Bitcoin does not sacrifice trust less ness for features. The altcoins that you have mentioned are suffering from one of these problems: 
1. They are new. This means that they still have to go through what Bitcoin has gone through. This means actually getting coins in different people’s wallets all around the world. The mechanism for this is the social scalability benefit of trust minimization. The less trust is needed, the more it grows in users and the public consciousness. Many of these altcoins have and will go down in flames before they ever reach the adoption level that Bitcoin has today. 
2. They are centralized and completely miss the point of trustlessness.

This isn't just for you. I don't really care if you buy bitcoin or not. This is also for anyone reading.
(I) A portion of new users become true believers. Rinse and repeat with waves of new users and you get more hodlers and true believers.
(II) All of this one is pretty much nonsense and it's just your speculation.
(III) Are you talking about price manipulation on exchanges? How is this a problem? If it's just buying and selling, then it's not manipulation.
(IIII) It's not about cool gagdets. It's about trust. People trust bitcoin more than all the others for good reasons. Keep researching.

Great post. Thanks for sharing.
Let's say that the blockchain essentially "grinds to a halt" one day. As long as our bitcoin is committed to a channel like in the LN, then HTLCs could be our method of sharing Bitcoin with the masses.
It's like the natives and the underwater rock. Much more efficient than dragging it from village to village.
This solves many issues imo. Power consumption,  etc. I could be crazy or missing something.

@_date: 2017-12-09 13:49:49
I understand and agree with the 1MB blocks. Have you ever run a full node? It already takes forever to download the blockchain. We don't need to make it more difficult or impossible for a regular Joe to run a full node.
It reminds me of when I read *Basic Economics* by Thomas Sowell. In one chapter he talks about price gouging laws. For instance hotels during a flood. The people who get there first get a room for $99. So the parents get a room, the grandma gets a room, and the kids get a room. When the next family comes, there are no rooms available at any price and they sleep in their cars.
If the hotel is allowed to "price gouge" and charge $300 per room, then the first family decides to get one room and the kids sleep on the floor. The second family that comes up has a room available.
Space on the blockchain is a finite resource. So you and me and others learn to economize and use it properly, not like some infinite resource that can cater to every spam and nonsense. This is precious space on the ark.

You're right.

This is the most important thing.
I think everyone should get some good HODL memes in reserve. Call your family and friends if you need to.
Then buy the hell out of dips. Show them that we, the people, are legion.

Everyone is waiting on layer 2 to spend. Also, we want to spend our coins with a higher value.
Right now is price discovery. The market is saying "How about $16,000?" We are like "nuh uh." 
Let us have our price discovery. 
By buying something, you are saying that your Bitcoin is worth the current value.
All of you who keep saying these things don't get that.
Oh yeah one more thing. HODL

The price going up is our fellow man realizing the value of these private keys. That's good. 
Speculation is fine. It's needed. 
All we have to have is a way to point to it as a store of value and soon a unit of account.

@_date: 2017-12-02 02:22:21
I DCA. Sometimes I buy when it's skyrocketing because I like to picture that I am helping move it higher. And then if it goes higher than that, then all good.
I also buy like crazy during dips.
When the price is stable for a few days, I am not really motivated to buy. But I do anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:35:38
No. This is *price discovery.*

I will only sell for fiat when I must. For tax and stuff.
Hopefully the system comes tumbling down soon so I don't have to pay taxes anymore and don't have to worry about it.
Taxes at gunpoint is a *killer app* for USD adoption lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:13
This is really good shit! Bitcoin is about a change in mindset. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:04:10
What gives the dollar value? The dollar is valued because individuals make subjective decisions about what to trade. Same with any currency.
Sure the USD has threats of violence built into it, but threats of violence do not stop new technologies. 
The soundest money will win and become the one money. The soundest money is bitcoin to date. So look at it like this... 1 BTC = 1/21 million of the wealth of the planet. That statement I just made is more true and verifiable than what any government could tell us about the fiat currency we use.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:22:55

The Yap Island natives with the Rai Stones were not interested in change. However, they changed nonetheless as they came in contact with people who used gold. Also, the purchasing power of the Yap Islanders' savings were destroyed.
Sounder money will eventually destroy the purchasing power of people's savings who hodl the less sound money. The Yap Islanders did not want to use gold, but eventually they were forced to.


You didn't say any facts. What do you mean by "works"?
@_date: 2018-05-27 03:11:20
You don't have to have specialized knowledge. You can hire people with specialized knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:12:14
Yes. At least laws based on violence.
When relating with other people, the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) should always be followed. No other rules are needed. Most people naturally try to follow this rule already (except when engaging in politics).
However, a group of people can make rules as long as it is voluntary in nature and people can leave.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:59:58
Yeah the dollar is dropping like a rock compared to Bitcoin. 1 BTC is still 1 BTC.
Bitcoin hodls (or stores) my value for me. This is denominated in Bitcoin.


It was valuable to me as a store of my value. I prefer this method of storing my value because I don’t want counterparty risk and Bitcoin is really convenient compared to precious metals. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:02:18

As a matter of fact, if the world doesn't turn to Bitcoin, it will be a shitty place anyways, so... I will just be an angry hermit if Bitcoin "fails." But it will be a hell hole, so no biggie. That's how I feel at least.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:26:15
The political philosophy and economics of Bitcoin are inseparable. As Bitcoin works, it validates the Austrian economists and anarcho-capitalists.

The government can't do it. They are too slow, too wasteful, and too incompetent. All they will succeed in doing is wasting a bunch of money trying.

Awesome. I saved your post so I can re-read it a few times and take everything in. I like to think in terms of hunter-gatherers. You walk along eating berries at exactly the rate that will keep you alive. If you want to build a bow and arrow, you must get a stash of berries to sustain you while you build the bow and arrow. Once you have the bow and arrow, you can kill a deer and have enough meat for a month. During the month, you build a trebuchet and you can now kill several deer at once. Savings must happen before capital creation. The more real savings, the more badass equipment, homes, weapons, etc you can create.

The best adoption of Bitcoin is buy and hodl. We need hodlers of last resort. Is that what you mean?
BCH are the fools out there screaming about "adoption." These folks are only focused on bitcoin as a payment method. Being a payment method is not bitcoin's strong suit. 
Don't worry about adoption. In some ways, I don't want more folks to know about it until I can get some more. This is how something precious and scarce is treated.

Right! Impressed with the people too. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:49:52


That would describe almost all national currencies today. People believe in them anyways. If we want instant, remote payments then we have to believe in something. 
So let's believe in sound, censorship resistant, counterparty risk not required, international money. Bitcoin.
They won't be able to fund their wars without inflation.

We don't need to keep coffee purchases forever. Everything doesn't have to be on chain.
If LN sucks, you don't have to use it. You could always buy another currency to spend if you don't want to pay BTC fees every time.

However, they are divisible down to tiny units. 8 decimal places and beyond.
If a tenth of a coin rises in value to where a whole coin once was, then the whole coin will be ten times it's former value.

You invest with a stock or something that creates income.
You speculate when you buy low and sell high.
You save when you put something away to use in the future.
It's just more accurate to use a different word than investing because it doesn't create a divdend or income.

That's why Bitcoin is the best. We have the best hodlers. Hodling tells the world "This is the one!" through the price signals.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:24:33
Bitcoin is at least tied with the most ethical form of money ever invented. Even with gold, people who are stronger can carry more. That's an inherent advantage in the system. Bitcoin has no inherent advantages. Even robots and aliens can hodl Bitcoin.

No they won't be teaching this in Economics textbooks because it is conjecture and faulty thinking. You should check your premises.


Yes it can. For evidence I would like to submit the people who have done exactly what you said can't be done.


What is your definition of commonly used? What does this mean?


What is this "point" and what causes it? 


What makes you say that? Where do you think we are on the S curve of adoption?


Wut? Why? There is no "blink first." If it's a hodling competition, you think smaller investors can last longer than people with millions? 
Check your premises and think about incentives.

Other than changing the world, What are your goals with cryptocurrency? Mine is to make as much money as possible while not violating my principles of non-aggression. Almost all cryptocurrencies fit into my idea of non-aggression, so that leaves me with the money maximizing decisions.

I think OP might be a concern troll.
Anybody who actually hodls Bitcoin and runs a node wouldn't be asking this question.

@_date: 2017-11-29 22:18:32
Yeah that's going to keep happening a lot.
But it's natural and ok.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:08:00
Right. That was my point. You are waiting on Bitcoin to collapse and I am waiting on the USD to collapse.
If the USD is so entrenched that it will never go anywhere, then why is it constantly falling in value relative to Bitcoin and goods and services?
Meanwhile, the purchasing power of a Bitcoin is skyrocketing. I think Bitcoin has a lot further to go before market discovery tells us the value. Meanwhile, the dollar is losing its grasp on the world in many different ways.
If they allowed interest rates to rise, then people wouldn't need Bitcoin like they do right now. But they can't do that because it's not politically popular. So good luck depending on the USD.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:03:55
Yes. Bitcoin will hasten the end of Rome. Of course Rome is Washington DC these days.

The people developing Bitcoin get it. 
Any cryptocurrency that wants to be like Bitcoin must go through everything that Bitcoin has gone through.
I want to save my money in a way that doesn't rot, doesn't rely on government laws, isn't inflated, etc. So I save with Bitcoin.
Use the coins for what they are best at. I want a hoard of liquid money in the future, so I save Bitcoin. Notice that transaction times and fees are not part of my current worries. Same with Bitcoin. A system is being created to withstand all the businesses and governments in the world. Fees and transaction times are a secondary concern.

The most important things are antifragility and trustlessness. Bitcoin does these the best by far.

Guide 2 is an altcoin. The gear are the features. Guide 1 is Bitcoin. Here is why I choose Bitcoin and Hugh Glass. Hugh can always go buy some gear when and if he really needs it. However Guide 2 can't become Hugh Glass overnight. In fact, most Guide 2s and altcoins will die trying.

Just a suggestion. Maybe you should read and study some more. Not being attached to a coin tells me that you see little difference between them.

I would. I bought more today.
People were asking this last week and last month if that gives you a clue.

Keep researching and reading. You may agree with me about the million dollar estimates.
This is what Bitcoin does. It consistently destroys everyone's expectations because the idea is so valuable to mankind. The idea of storing and sending value without having to trust anyone. How much is that worth?

It's fine for a currency to be deflationary and scarce. This would cause a gentle deflation in all prices as we manufacture and serve with less cost over time with technology and expertise. That is natural.
Having a scarce currency is different than what we have with the dollar, but it is better for everyone. When currency is lost or destroyed, everyone benefits with increased purchasing power.
It's a world that's all about saving instead of all about debt. Don't worry about consumption. Consumption is needed to live and will happen. Instead of our current "throw-away" economy, there will be more incentive to buy it for life. 
Things will look completely different in the future, and it will be heaven on earth just like now is heavenly compared to the middle ages.

Interesting. I don't heavily use it, but it has worked for me on several occasions. I do most through Coinbase/GDAX.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:45:40
Yes you did. Correct. Or the merchant could eat the fee and use the Bitcoin sales as long term savings instead of paying into something else. You are 100% correct that it will make an expense, but a smart merchant can do it without raising prices if they believe in the future value of Bitcoin. Honestly, a smart merchant will make products cheaper if the person uses BTC. As long as not all sales are in BTC so that the merchant can pay their daily costs.

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:03:26
Yeah that makes sense. But they will want Bitcoin, and those Bitcoin have to come from somewhere, so it could exert some upward pressure on the USD price which would require even more USDT to get Bitcoin.

I don't think so. 150 billion is the market cap, but not all the coins are for sale. Many are lost and in cold storage. So it doesn't take that much money to get to that market cap.

I like the sentiment, but people can do what they want with their shit as long as they are not hurting anyone else and not be immoral.
Unless they are selling out of necessity, I think less of their intelligence because they obviously bought something they didn't understand and then never got to understand. You can tell if someone doesn't understand because they sell. People who understand don't dump.

We could, but there is currently no need to. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Instead, work on (or wait for) complimentary (layer 2) technology and services that provide for the secondary concerns of spendability, etc.

They use "protecting Net Neutrality" as a Trojan Horse to get the precedent. Then they use that precedent later to do what they want.
I don't want legislators and politicians to even think about the internet. We don't need men with guns to help us because in the end, they will destroy and enslave and ruin.
Edit: By saying that the law is necessary, you are saying that we can't have good internet without men with guns enforcing rules.

Hi there. Bitcoin exists so that productive members of society can resist being stolen from by people like you. That's the whole point, to diminish your destructive power as much as possible. You should think about changing your ways and leaving the childish political shit behind.

Do $1000 now and save the other $1000 in case it goes lower.
I would just buy it all today as long as you plan on hodling.

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:53:50
Not a coherent thought in here.
Supply of coins for sale is going to dry up. Bitcoin is the hodl coin, not the trading coin. I think you are thinking like a trader.
I know a lot of people who won’t part with their coins for less than $1M, and that number grows every day.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:22:26
More hodlers every day. Only 21,000,000 coins
 The rate of acceleration will continue to get faster in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:29:16
I think $25k before the end of the year. I am trying to stop underestimating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:53:02


That's the weak link IMO. They haven't done the initial buy yet. The last few months was just enthusiasts and individuals. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:38:46
How should one take action and defend?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:32:24
Yes. I hodl bitcoin. I am waiting until 2020 to start spending them. I believe it will be $1M per coin by then. I buy as big as I can during dips and I buy steady every week.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:42:48
Right. Bitcoin is about ridding ourselves of the welfare/warfare/crony capitalist state and banking cartels.
We don't need the state to protect the internet because they can't protect anything.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:51:13
If the government wanted to try to stop Bitcoin, do you think a prior "Net Neurtality" law would stop them? LOL. They wouldn't even have to repeal the law to do it. They would just mount a propaganda campaign and force the ISPs to do it. They go back on their word all the time. Plus, a nice healthy ISP marketplace is better than a stupid Net Neutrality law. It's like government training wheels that we don't need and slow us down. Let's let the market shake out and see who the good and bad ISPs are.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:54:08
You CAN get into it now. It's still just the beginning.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:41:56
My best guess is yes. It is resolved.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:51
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:40:55
Bitcoin has the most value because the most people believe that it has value. 
The market price is saying "this is where we want to store our money" and we will do the most to defend it. That is why it works. We have the best hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:34:28
Legal does not equal moral. That's the equivalence. Think about the implications of my first sentence.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:51:50
Hopefully this helps. You might need to forget some stuff you learned.
1)Gresham's Law states that the good money drives out the bad. I like to spend dollars today and hodl my bitcoin close. That's ok for now. 
We have a built in safety valve that will keep us from saving too much. People have to consume to live eventually.
2)This will move society to a saver society instead of a debtor society. This is good because all that interest is tough on everyone. Maybe there will be lending between close friends, or maybe a reputation service will help people lend. Instead of lending in the future, we may take on partners in business ventures. This gets more eyes in society speculating on business ventures and this is good for mankind. By speculating I mean learning about a venture and buying good ones and shorting bad ones. It's good for society when we have more eyes doing this and experienced at it.
3)I would have to read about it, but I can tell you through deductive reasoning that no central planning has ever saved an economy (at least without creating the problem first). The crisis (distortion) was caused by government intervention. Bitcoin starves the government of funds, so it is less likely in a bitcoin world that these major market distortions will happen.
Bitcoin is the validation of the Austrian monetary theories. It is working because there is no such thing as macroeconomics. There is also no value in it. Only destruction.

Yes. Because I can fire my ISP. If I try to fire the government, they will shoot me.
If my internet sucks, I will know that it is the ISP that sucks. If lots of people are upset with their internet, this is a huge opportunity in the market to fill that gap and make money.
I am for a neutral internet. I think the way to do it is not to build a house upon the sand. When the system requires a law and enforcement with guns and papers, this is built on sand.
I want my internet to be built upon a rock, and not depend on a law and jurisdictions. 
I will admit. It's possible that it gets worse before it gets better, but all these laws will unwind one day.

Bitcoin is Hugh Glass.
Altcoins are like new guides with GPS and space blankets.
I can get Hugh Glass a GPS and space blanket pretty easily.
The new guides can become Hugh Glass, but it will take years and many of them will die trying.
I used to mess around with altcoins, but if I went back and just bought Bitcoin I would be doing way better. It set me back months. 
One of the most educational things I did was run a bitcoin full node, just FYi.

Yes. It's saving. It's a savings account. It doesn't grow (except with forks, but that's a different story.

We are like squirrels saving nuts. Except they are actually diamonds and not everyone has realized it yet.

1. Personal financial freedom. I want to be rich like Forrest Gump so I can do what I want.
2. Financial freedom from banks and government for the world - this will bring a new Renaissance and make the world a lot better. Better medicine, art, technology, architecture, etc. I would like to see it.
Bonus reason: schadenfreude for the assholes in government, central banking, and the herd that defends them.

Call me crazy, but I don't mind having coins with the chain with the longest difficulty adjustment. I want more zealots mining at a loss to secure their wealth. Fine. Makes sense. I would.

What is more likely? Dump or buy? I would actually hope for a dump because a lot of those coins will be bought and hodlded by folks like us. Those coins will go from potential dump to locked up by hodlers for the foreseeable future.

Less gentle deflation. The block reward would continue to subsidize mining. Basically it would cost less fees and encourage more transactions on chain. I don't think we really gain anything by making the block reward go on forever.

The utility makes people want them. The scarcity is what will drive the price to $1M. Lots of hodlers out there drying up supply... :-)
I think a combination of supply and demand will push it up to $1M. 
It's an ever-expanding blueberry. 
Somebody described when the institutional money came in as the daily water use of New York City being pumped into an ever-expanding blueberry. So I really think it will go above $1M, but I like to say $1M since it's a round number.

Sure. If your goal is to be as liquid rich as possible, then buying Bitcoin early and often as possible is the best method to do that. If it’s the best store of value, and if you want to have liquid stored value in the future, then it’s really the only crypto to buy. 
That’s my thinking at least, because I want to have plenty of LIQUID wealth. I can be a millionaire in property and not feel rich. But what I really want is stored value that can be spent when and where I please. Viola. Bitcoin. I really don’t have a need for an alt. At least until a truly better store of value comes along. Then I will evaluate what to do.
Edit: People are not pumping bitcoin’s price with the goal of finding a greater fool. People are literally saving their value here for the long haul, using the system as intended. We want to SPEND our Bitcoin. When you realize that people are really doing this, and when you realize that there are only 21 million of them, and when you realize that the best developers in the world are hardening this system every day, and when you realize that no other coin can compete with bitcoin in real decentralization, and when you realize that it can’t be cooped by monied interests... There’s no other place I would rather be.

Correct me if I am wrong, but here's the situation as far as I know currently.
There's some law where the US government forces ISPs to treat all internet traffic the same. The FCC for whatever reason wants to get rid of it.
We all know that gubmint laws don't make us more free.
I guess if it gets repealed, then companies will advertise unrestricted internet and then I can get on Reddit to find out what packages are the best and which ones throttle, etc. If some ISPs don't do Bitcoin, then they will be called out and we can avoid them.
Goes back to "buyer beware" instead of "trust the gubmint." This is inline with how bitcoin works.
TLDR: Glad they are getting rid of dumb laws. This could help some people develop the skill of discernment and how to investigate choose a service instead of relying on the government.

Plus, none of them are as anti-fragile. They can claim that, but they don’t have as many enthusiasts in the wild setting up nodes.
They are going to continually have their clock cleaned because there will always be someone who thinks they can make up for a couple of years by trading alts. Nope. Just going to have to wait a little longer than the people who got in earlier than you. Bitcoin is not Blockbuster, and there is no Netflix coming. Bitcoin is Netflix. Folks need to get BTC and HODL.

The moment to start spending is an individual decision. You will know when to start spending because there will be something that you want or need more than the Bitcoin that you have. I am going to try to not spend anything until 2020. That's the plan now, but it could change.
The goal is to get rich and liquid. I am in Bitcoin because I believe it's the best currency in the world. If I am liquid, then it doesn't matter because I could buy crypto or fiat as needed.

Get Coinbase on your phone and buy $50 worth.
Then read, research, and don't sell no matter what.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:59:02
Amazing write up.
I will be Devil's advocate. Just because it has crashed hard in the past doesn't mean that it will do it again in the future. Also, same goes for long periods of time with price stagnation.
There's enough of us hodling now and buying dips that I just can't fathom it. More and more people are really understanding what Bitcoin can really do for us personally and for humanity.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:19:34
In this case, I have read up and I trust myself. I have regretted a few times when I knew to do something but didn't.
Edit: but thanks for the convo and advice
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:30:11
You don't want to do that. 99.9% are junk and will be less than Bitcoin in the long haul. Buy BTC and hodl. Wait a couple of years and then spend your coins as you need them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:29:33
Yeah but the fact that it's available and trusted at all is amazing. If it costs too much for them to save in this way, then they can choose an alternative method of saving. Poor people want the good shit, though, so some will pay the fee. If the fee ain't worth it, then they won't do it.
Edit: It's not 50% either
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:03:12
Just buy bitcoin and hodl is my advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:26:54
Weak hands will leave and be replaced. The % of hardcore hodling increases with every dip. Hodl strong no matter what.
My opinion is that they haven't bought yet.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:51:36
No. Bitcoin is undervalued big time.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:14:03
Hope it goes up to $10K and then dips back to about $9450. Or higher lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:47:52
Go straight to Satoshis. This should be done ASAP IMO. 
12K Satoshis to the us dollar
Become a Satoshi millionaire for only $82!
Plus we won't have to change it again until so many decimal places are added that it needs to happen again.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:46:54
$7300 coins will look like a steal in the near future imo. Don't despair and don't give yourself a heart attack. Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:13:49
Nope. Maybe some dumbasses will sell and lose their coins, but this is not an existential threat to Bitcoin. This is an existential threat to tether, which is not Bitcoin. There are plenty of exchanges also. Nothingburger unless you have coins on bitfinex or you like to hodl tether.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:12
Buy the dip
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:34:22
I think 2018 will be bigger than 2017. I think the availability of coins for sale is drying up.
Most people won't take less than $1M per coin.
So I am very optimistic. $25,000 by 12/31 is my crazy prediction.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:34:34
Same reason anyone else would.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:52:27
They don't actually have the money if everyone withdrew their funds. Everybody thinks they have a certain amount of money, but it's the same money being counted multiple times. Those shenanigans are going away thank god.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:55:02
Let me be Devil's Advocate. This may sound mean, so bear with me...
Ver's and others of his ilk's antics separate fools from their money. We get these dips and this free money. It culls the herd and concentrates the potential wealth that Bitcoin can bring into those who have the intelligence and stomach for it. We are able to acquire more cheaper because other potential BTC buyers are led astray by bad ideas. Honestly, it doesn't matter because if they weren't parted from their coins by someone like Ver, then they would have fell for something else later. Failing and learning a lesson quickly rather than slowly can be beneficial. So in a way, thanks Roger Ver. He makes it cheaper for me to keep buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:40:40
Dude you hooked me so hard. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:44:49
That's how it's supposed to work. A fool and his money are soon departed. I used to mess with that stuff and squirmed with them. I wizened up so now I watch them squirm.

Did that for a couple of months and then compared it to if I had just hedl BTC.... I don't alt trade anymore. I just HODL BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:52:42
This is the first time in most of our lives that we have hedl a deflationary asset, so hodling Bitcoin is awesome and people are excited. That excitement is enough to make real demand and more hodlers through word of mouth.

Bitcoin is the about the one stable thing in the universe when it comes to value.

Another dude and I had a conversation here. I will talk about it more if needed though. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:05:02
Don't worry about that. The people who are hodling bitcoin increasingly understand. 
We want an antifragile, decentralized, trustless store of value with a way to move the money. That's what we have right now with Bitcoin. The price just reflects how many other people get it and how many resources they can spend on it. I know Bitcoin will get better, but if it stayed just like it is, I would be happy.
So with that said, why would I sell my BTC? Why would others who think like me?
I think the tick, tick, tick is your own countdown to finally understanding Bitcoin.

OK. Either way, I want nothing to do with the shady, lying, traditional rigged system. I want them to compete with me on even terms with no built-in advantages. Bitcoin may one day be known as a Great Equalizer.

The average amount hedl will constantly decrease as new people buy in.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:21:07
Great question. I have pondered this myself.
Maybe make a web store with hardware wallets and merch? Bitcoin ATMs?
The answer I came to was to make money in the "real world" and then buy Bitcoin as much as possible. Bitcoin naturally resists businesses and the entrenchment and middleman-ness. Bitcoin really doesn't need middlemen except for the "on ramps."
Maybe you can do side jobs for Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-11-26 12:38:10
Yeah but there's counterparty risk with the bank/government too. 
I have savings and stored value in things other than my Bitcoin savings account, but I am most excited about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:02:44
The new money and rising price isn't from people who want to spend it. They want to have a savings account with a good interest rate. Right now the price is soaring because there is high demand for this in our inflationary society.
People aren't buying Bitcoin to have fast, cheap, anonymous transactions. Some will chicken out, but many will hodl. This signals to the market, "this is where we want to keep our savings" and is reflected in the price. This is ok and natural and beneficial. 
Something has to be a store of Value before it can be a currency.
Store of Value

No. This is like a squirrel gathering nuts pretty much.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:38:21
The fanatic hodlers, who have been hodling for years make Bitcoin like Hugh Glass. The alts don't have that, and it will take a long time to get it.
However, we can strap features on to Bitcoin at anytime.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:46:47
Maybe do a trial run with 50 pounds first. Practice everything from creating to spending from your paper wallet. Once you have successfully done that, then do the bigger balance.

@_date: 2017-11-24 21:20:52
Money can definitely be made. 
The advantage of Bitcoin is that you get the best store of value as well as the price increases. The rare combination of safest and highest growth potential. When enough people realize this, the moon will occur and it will make the alt booms look small in comparison. I think there will be many alt bagholders upset at themselves.

Of course about Gresham's Law. Thanks. I got the out and in backwards. But that explains what will happen with hodlers. 
I seriously believe that Bitcoin will be a huge redistribution of wealth from those who use laws to maintain their status (individuals and businesses) to those who are competent speculators (which is actually super important to get more real wealth for mankind). This will lift tons of people out of poverty. I am talking real productivity with real pursuits, not bombs and shit.
Yes. Austrian Economic Theorists in the past have advocated a strict gold standard. Bitcoin is exactly those principles of what we call "sound" monetary policy. Austrian economic theory believes in a not distorting the market interest rate as well as no fractional reserve banking. These things are basically impossible with Bitcoin. 
Austrians want to End the Fed. So does Bitcoin.

Yep. I think where he is going wrong is that this isn't a moral problem. It is a technical and game theory problem. It is a waiting game at the moment. Patience while being rewarded with 10x returns every year.
Maybe he thinks the temporary lack of ability to service microtransactions is a moral issue. The thing is, this is temporary, and we'd rather have something that works next year than something that can be everything for everyone and breaks next year. Patience is actually a virtue in this space. I know it may seem counterintuitive, but it seems that way.

You are being profoundly confused by his comment.
At $5000 BTC, I am selling my car for it.
I would mortgage my home again to buy $2000. 
I am not the only one who would do this. Once you mostly understand, they would need a team of horses to pull you away from buying Bitcoin.
Price only tells me how much Bitcoin I can afford today. That's it. It really doesn't matter because I am never selling. Only spending whenever I am ready.
I encourage you to keep researching. Watch Andreas Antonopolous on YouTube.

Find work to do for Bitcoin if you can.
Or seriously drop out of school, get a job, and buy Bitcoin.

I see what you are trying to do here.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:13:53
Removing coins from the available coins to be sold. Putting them in your wallet and keeping them there for years. Not for sale. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:43:17
Right on.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:33:37

Don't ever sell for fiat. Start spending your coins in a couple of years. Hodl strong brother.

Because it's the blockchain that everyone wants to use. It's a fee set by the market.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:10:16
I don't know if you saw my edit, but maybe look at market cap as occupancy in this example.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:09
Nice post. I can’t wait to see it in action.
I don’t think they should do anything to artificially lower fees. While fees are high, it keeps spam out. I’m not too worried about raising the block size until we absolutely have to.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:08:05
Well there is an incentive for someone to figure out how to do it. Maybe buying shit inside Zimbabwe? Maybe sell Bitcoin for diamonds over there? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:16:48
Yes it has. The amount of value in Bitcoin savings accounts has increased ten times. This means it is being used ten times more to hodl Bitcoin savings.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:25:34
I would suggest hodling them for a long time.
But if you must consume some of your Bitcoin, it is better to go to something else than fiat currencies that are being devalued every day.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:00:08
Don't think that way. Pick the best one and you will win in the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:35:18
I can move thousands  in Bitcoin for less than five bucks. Good deal!
I can also move thousands for "free" with my bank. It's also "instant" if we use the same bank. Awesome deal.
Bitcoin can't compete with them yet and may never be able to. If that's the case, then let's accept it by shoring up our store of value and moving on to layer 2.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:17:16
I think this is going to morph into something beyond the blockchain.

Bitcoin is a liquid currency. No need to sell for fiat unless out of necessity. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:15:25
I would say that it's more about confidence in the dollar, etc and knowledge of alternatives.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:35:22
Because muh diversification
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:39:38
I feel more safe saving Bitcoin. Maybe if I wanted to buy something privately, I would use Monero.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:31:22
If it's better than their alternative, then what is the problem? Bitcoin necessarily has to be a slow-moving beast.

There will probably be more dips. Certainly there will be. We just don't know how big they will be. It seems that the dips are getting smaller and smaller, but I could be wrong.
Either way, this is just guessing. I would say that it is important to get some skin in the game asap. Maybe take half the money you were planning on spending and buy now. Take the other half and wait for a dip. That way, you don't miss either way. This is called dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:35:11
Yep. I am bounded only by my available fiat.

@_date: 2018-03-01 11:22:45
When someone advocates for government action, they are advocating for the use of aggression. The state uses violent means to its ends against otherwise peaceful people.
We have nothing to fear j the Russians or the North Korean people. We would get along fine with them if we ever got the chance. 
The state does not protect you. The state is an enemy of freedom and prosperity. Is violence necessary to build a road? Is violence necessary to feed a hungry person?
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:34:12
Good point about the smart and the dumb. I would say that the current system is worse for the not-so-intelligent people. Politicians are the clever ones preying on the dumb. 
Reputation services have fewer incentives to lie than politicians in my opinion.

It's anti government. It's a replacement for many government functions. It also changes the game completely with taxation making it voluntary. So it's anti status quo government at least.

I went to school. It was private. 
I have used roads. I do not think we should have a military that does expeditions overseas. Maybe each city could have some defenders or something if they feel like they need it. As far as jails, I don't like paying to keep people who do victimless crimes in a cage.
The important question here:
Why do you feel the need to be a defender of the status quo? What do you get out of spouting conventional wisdom to someone with an idea for a more humane and prosperous future?
I imagine that you would probably defend whatever the system du jour is... You would defend slavery, serfdom, or whatever is popular... because you don't think for yourself. Serfdom is natural! Have you ever used the Lord's land? Have you ever used the Lord's land? These questions are just as nonsensical as yours. If the state demands 35% of my income, am I 35% a slave? Of course. Same shit.
But it does not have to be this way. Forget your brainwashing and evalute each statement on it's own merits. You can be the master of your own destiny. Those politicians and academics are not better than you! You are probably better than them.
If you want to learn more, look up Austrian Economics. Thank me later.

@_date: 2018-03-16 15:26:03
Like people who work for the government, people who rely on welfare, people who work for companies that do business with the government, people who live in flood zones and depend on government to make their homes economically viable, all war industries, all spying agencies and their vendors, universities that depend on government largess, etc.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:25:09
Your "opinion" is to shill for alts, correct?
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:39:09
There's really no argument. That's what this person is trying to say.
You have to have a good understanding of the following topics:
Austrian Economics
Game Theory
How humans respond to incentives
Basic computer literacy
You have to start with a good grasp of the above topics, then you can start understanding bitcoin. This could take a year and several books, and you still won't know everything there is to know.
Once you do all of that, then you will know it's not gambling. So to give you a one-liner that could wow your friends would be tough.
Your friends will either have to trust you, trust someone else, gamble, or educate themselves. There's no way to get around it.

Just to add since that interested you.. They turn into agents specifically when you question the status quo.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:52:41
You forget that people have to consume.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:13:42
Ok. A car costs $29,999.99, for instance. "Thirty thousand bucks."
How about 2,999,999 satoshis? Same digits.
"Three million Sat"
Something that costs $4.99 (four ninety nine or five dollars) today will cost 57,970 sat (fifty eight thousand sat). We can assume that someone pricing in Satoshis would round that to 59,999 sat. The difference is 2,020 sat ($0.18), so the merchant can use the round number for pricing and it's not much different.
A penny is basically 100 sat. A gallon of milk is 36k sat. A gallon of gas is 30k sat. 
Dinner and a movie date is 1 - 1.7 million Sat.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:55:13
Yeah that's fine. Exposure to Austrian Economics is important to truly get bitcoin. That's what I was saying. I am sure there's no 100% consensus in the school. Most folks don't ponder these things at all.

It takes the bitcoin off the market and reduces supply.
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:59:41
Wrong! Bitcoin's strength lies in its decentralization, trustlessness, and censorship resistance. A blockchain that sacrifices trustlessness for features will have neither. Bitcoin is a secure store of value, not whatever you think it is.
Government crypto misses the entire point of cryptocurrency. Censorship resistance.
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:19:28
I agree with you about services in their current forms. Assuming you are correct about credit/debit, what about the store of value use case?  
Also, keep in mind people are learning to pay using their phones now, so it will be an easier transition. Custodial wallets, etc, exist too. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:30:21

@_date: 2017-09-19 17:23:40
Ok yeah. I just looked it up. They don't allow extra charges for using a credit card. But you can do as you say and charge a cash price. 
I appreciated overstock.com letting us know they are going to hodl 50%. It means they are not complicit with the current system. Call it virtue signaling, but that signals to me that a business is one of the good guys.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:11:32
Correct! This is where the OP argument breaks down. You can withdraw and spend the cash, but the lent Bitcoin only exists in his imagination.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:47:55
You have to comply for the government to get your bitcoin.  That's different than physical currency and bank balances. Gold can work as buried treasure, but it's less convenient.
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:05:21
Yeah pretty much. However in the future we will mitigate this risk in some way.
This definitely could turn into a risk for early adopters if we run our mouths.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:23:14
Too collectivist and centralized. I think everyone would opt out if they have the choice.
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:00:32
Bitcoin is closer to the "dark ages" than it is to this convoluted, corrupt system we have today.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:38:35
Yeah. Big difference from a couple of years ago. I didn't buy earlier because Ron Paul and Doug Casey were not fans.
Now both are slowly coming around.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:19:17
Don't worry about the cap. We can add decimal places. People won't run a node for the purpose of changing Bitcoin to be inflationary. Instead, they will buy in before their neighbors. Once in, they won't want to dilute their coins.
Social engineering... always going to happen. Bitcoin don't care about social engineering.
Centralization pressure is already happening. Bitcoin is surviving.
Lightning network and layer 2 solutions take care of your last point. 
I don't understand your point about Bugs. With more eyes on the software, there should be more people calling out bugs.
Bitcoin has some problems, but these ain't it.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:18:28
You use your Bitcoin to go where there is power/internet, etc.
If it's a planet-wide, Walking Dead style calamity, then your gold won't do you much good either.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:40:49
That's a bleak outcome. I am a little more optimistic (for good reason with things like the internet and bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:06:15
We are trying to fundamentally change human society, and Bitcoin is our nuke. We don't need these huge welfare/warfare states. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:12:09
Ok. Then I would say that the people who sold and re-bought and increased their BTC are either smarter than me or lucky. Thing is... I can't know which one.
@_date: 2017-09-15 06:04:28
You are very wrong. Normie fuckery is not the way to a new world. If you want something different than the shit fiats, then it will probably look a little different.
You still believe in the status quo having some value... It doesn't! It's just a bunch of smoke and mirrors.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:40:23
Yeah friggin a lot
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:15:12
The main things that banks do are lending, fees, and manipulation. The only reason they are in business is because of laws and regulations that shut out competition to them.
Bitcoin doesn't have to ask permission from the government, so it's not beholden to and subject to manipulation.
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:30:38
All of your points are about usability as a currency. Don't worry about that yet. First, we need to shore up Bitcoin as a censorship resistant store of value. Everything else is a secondary concern or "nice to have."

The yap Islanders were doing fine with their rai stones. There was literally no problem.
Then some Irish dude came. He offered them gold, but they didn't want it. So he started making rai stones to get the Islanders to gather coconuts for him. He could make them easily compared to the Islanders. He sucked all the savings out of that society and completely upended their way of life.
So here's the Irish dude asking you if you would like to accept gold. You are the Yap islander saying, "nah, my rai stones work fine.
This is not about solving a problem for you. Gold beat the rai stones and bitcoin will beat gold and fiat. You can either recognize it or not. If you are smart, then this change will be a boon for you. Otherwise it will be scary as your life is turned upside down as one of the masses.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:57:45
The protocol can still be the same. The decimal does not have to be moved yet. Wallet software can be updated to do the conversions for us and make it so that users don't have to worry about the decimal in their wallets (hopefully configurable back to BTC when desired). Exchanges could show Sats very easily if they wanted to. Then all that's left is for us talk to each other and price things in that way. 
It's more of a social change, I think. Right now, $10 gets you 112K Sats. Become a Satoshi millionaire for only $88! Not too shabby.

You don't have to worry about it. The market takes care of it fine. Seriously. You will be buying different goods than the average consumer, so you won't be in competition with them for things. You won't drive up the prices of white bread by buying as much as you can afford. Instead, you will be bidding up the prices on super yachts with me. And those coins will be distributed just fine according to the market.
Plus, decimal places can be added.

This allows competing currencies! So each currency is finite, but there are an infinite amount of replacements if Bitcoin fucks up.
I am 100% Bitcoin only because it is the most decentralized and censorship resistant. Also, the devs understand that these are the most important things. If Bitcoin loses this philosophy, then I will cash out and go to another currency that puts these priorities first.

Yeah but I can take bitcoin to my grave. The government must steal and seize to survive. If I have gold, they can just take it. If I die with gold that the government wants, they can just take it. If I die with bitcoin that the government wants, the value is instead spread among all hodlers of the currency. Now the government must ask nicely if they ever want to see it. Either that or torture. The total incentive structure is different.
I would say the closest thing to bitcoin is buried treasure. But bitcoin is way more convenient.

As long as people hodl their own private keys, then fractional reserve banking is not possible with Bitcoin. Fractional reserve banking increases the money supply to the detriment of the savers and to the advantage of the debtors. This distortion destroys wealth in our society.
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:35:29
Difference is that Bitcoin functions as a bank, so no middle man or trust is required. Cash under a mattress can be confiscated or ruled to not be legal tender. Fractional reserve banking and the FDIC destroy wealth and add no utility.

Actually, it is very easy to not work for the government. It is LAZY both intellectually and lifestyle-wise to claim that someone has to work for the government. Perfect person for a government job, huh?

The price doesn't matter in the way you think it does. The price is arbitrary, in a way, because each coin is different and denominated differently. Also, different total supplies have an effect on price.
Also, you can buy a portion of a Bitcoin, so don't worry that Bitcoin is "expensive."
I think if you do further research, you may decide that the altcoins are not worth it.

@_date: 2017-09-26 11:56:50
Here's the short answer. Don't worry about features yet. Features are secondary to a trustless, decentralized, censorship resistant coin. First it has to be secured as a store of value. If this is done properly, then everything else will fall into place nicely. This is why I am 100% Bitcoin. It does the most important things best.

Visa and MasterCard will stop doing business with merchants that discount based on payment type like that. When you see a business accepting Bitcoin, ask them if they convert it immediately or if they hodl. If they hodl, then there is your incentive to buy, because it locks up more Bitcoin with hodlers and makes the available supply of sellable coins go down and the price up.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:03:07

It's called SAVING. SAVINGS have to exist before a loan can exist. The savings are loaned out. So how did the first person ever build capital? They had to save. Bitcoin encourages us to save and spend based on our needs and prices. This is how we should consume.

I know all about Peter Schiff and what he says about Bitcoin. It doesn't change the content of his comic. You should read it. Anyone can save if they produce more than they consume.

It is possible for ANYONE to create wealth without borrowing ANYTHING.

You can exchange USD for Bitcoin at Coinbase and Gdax. You can send Bitcoin to Electrum from GDAX. You will pay transaction fees. Coinbase is a little more user friendly.

This is all just my opinion. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.

The Austrian school does not do that at all. It's about revealed preferences, not Keynesian stimulus that actually has a myopic focus on humans reacting to economic incentives while ignoring all other motivations.
Austrians are the only ones to recognize the complexity of human behavior. It is also the only economics that does not just beg for government intervention.

Gresham's Law applies here. People will hodl the good money and transact with the bad money. That's why people are hodling Bitcoin. We are just waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to our analysis that Bitcoin is superior to fiat currencies and probably gold. Once they do, Everyone will try to save in Bitcoin and unload dollars. That is probably going to happen. It is definitely more likely to happen than not happen.

We can still trust who we want to trust. Bitcoin doesn't take that away. Who in your life will you stop trusting due to Bitcoin?
With Bitcoin, you are just not forced to trust a bank anymore if you don't want to. You aren't forced to trust Visa or MasterCard. This lets us keep and utilize our wealth as we see fit.
Do you really like trusting your bank? I don't. However, I am going to have to trust my barber whether I pay him in dollars or Bitcoin. Trustlessness is not a mantra for life if you don't want it to be. Just don't trust other people with your wealth.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:14:22
Coinbase is better than watching from the sidelines. I think it's fine for holding your coins while you research and get comfortable with more advanced stuff. It's like training wheels, which is ok until you are ready to do something else.

If someone needs a nuke to defend themselves, then who am I to stand in their way. To be honest, an individual would probably never built a nuke. Only a state would build a weapon like that. Also, in a post-state world, there would be no mechanism to regulate in the first place. 
Also, the situation changes. What if we meet an alien species that kills us on sight, no questions asked... They might need a nuke.

I could be wrong, but I think it will all work out nicely. It's a speculative investment now, but people are going to want those Bitcoins. They will give you vacations, houses, cars, property, etc. I plan on spending mine after 2020. I think there will be places glad to take them off my hands.

Bigger block size makes it easier to spam the network as well as making it harder to run a node. We need a strong, untouchable, censorship-resistant, cheap, distributed, prolific group of nodes enforcing the rules. Then we need layer 2 for spendability. We don't want to compromise level 1 at all. Secure store of value first. Let spendability come from layer 2. I hope this helps.

Yeah me too man, but I am not a computer scientist. You know how they say "born too late to explore the planet and born too early to explore the stars? This is our shit. 
This is like the New World being discovered and all the opportunities it will bring. If we do this right, we can really accelerate space exploration and longevity therapies. Maybe get those tubes on Elysium before we croak. I think both you and I know that bitcoin can unlock human potential to get us there maybe within our lifetimes.
Have you ever heard of us being ancestor simulations? Sometimes I pretend that's what I am and I picture future person examining my life and being very interested because I lived to be 350 years old and did some cool shit.

Decentralized vs centralized. We don't always win. But we will win with Bitcoin this time. 
In my experience, yankees have a hard time understanding bitcoin. They love their big, centralized government. Definitely bearish on the frozen tundra yankeeland.

Bitpay is good for processing the transactions in a user friendly way. They have POS apps in the app stores. You don't have to convert it to fiat. You can either use the bitpay wallet or hodl your coins in the manner of your choice.

TLDR; they have a good tool and you can hodl the coins received from the pos.

There is no box that says "Today Bitcoin is at the highest it's going to be for two months. Would you like to sell?
Also, your binary choice of buy/sell Bitcoin happens every second of every day that you hodl. Also, there is the choice of degree, as in all of your BTC vs some of your BTC.
Binary choice. Buy lottery ticket or not buy. You have a statistical chance of success just like guessing with Bitcoin prices every second of every day.

Bitcoin is about personal responsibility and anarchy, to be honest. Middle of the road opinions simply water down our revolution and muddy the discourse. I am glad you posted, though, and I encourage you to keep learning every day, just like I try to.
Armored sheep. If you want to steal from an armored sheep, you have to trick each individual sheep into removing its armor. No more institutional theft.
So this will one day make taxes voluntary, hopefully, as people wisen up. Once it's voluntary, it's not taxes and it's not the state. It's a security service  or fire service or whatever else you need.

I would be overjoyed if Amazon accepted Bitcoin. The price would be fun to watch and Bitcoin would enter the public consciousness...
But to be Devil's advocate, this may be too much too soon. Andreas Antonopolous said it is his biggest fear; that Bitcoin blows up too quickly and is not ready. Fees and delays? Definitely if adoption goes up to a certain level.
Also, with that said, I don't really care about places to spend it until I am ready to spend. 
I would honestly rather have L2 be accepted at Amazon. The number one priority for Bitcoin should be to continue to armor up against all sorts of attacks. Who cares if merchants accept it yet.
But maybe Amazon will want to accumulate some Bitcoin and later use it to provide liquidity in their own lightning hub. If so, then that's good I guess.

@_date: 2017-10-16 22:14:35
Depends on the friend, but this is pretty simple. They may not get it.
You know how technology is progressing faster and faster? If they say yes, then move on to the next thing. If they say no, then say something like "there are more scientists and engineers on earth today than the whole history of mankind put together." If that doesn't work, then I would say "how much difference is there between the technology in 1900-1917 and 2000-2017. Or the difference between 1550-1650 and 1950-2050." This kinda butters them up to realize that they are part of a changing world. Everything is not part of the cosmic firmament. There was a time before the USD.
Maybe then ask them, "can you imagine the first person to use paper money instead of gold and silver coins? Everybody probably thought they were crazy with their fake money. Now they would look at you crazy if you tried to pay with gold or silver somewhere.
So tell them this is the next thing. Like paper replacing silver and gold coins. Humans like the convenience of digital money, and this is the best money and banking system in existence.

Easier to store
More difficult to counterfeit

I hear ya. However, the best feature of Bitcoin is its trustlessness. You lose that. Also, how would you combat counterfeits? You don't have a secret service that will travel the world with no rules to get the counterfeiters.
However, this is a problem that needs some brain power devoted to it. Good on ya for thinking about it.
What about this? Kiosks where people can transact with Bitcoin in a disaster or emergency situation? Put it near the shelters or shops in town or whatever. Just need a satellite internet connection, a tent, and some laptops. I think...

One of Bitcoin's primary functions is as a censorship-resistant, trustless store of value. How much is that worth to you? 
It's worth a lot more than my fiat to me, so I buy and store my value (hodl). Think about this... Having a store of value where you don't have to trust anyone and it can't be confiscated or stolen. I want those.
As far as price speculation is concerned, I believe that the price will continue to go up.

Let the media and the other subreddits on Reddit be the "balanced" ones. Along with the internet, Bitcoin is potentially the most uplifting technology since the printing press.
We don't live in a post-change world. The world can change within our lifetimes. This sub is important for spearheading this change that Bitcoin will bring. 
Bitcoin is a new technology. Price will follow adoption as people get it. The technology is not perfect, but the idea of decentralization and trustlessness is what is important. That's why I can be confident. It's like waiting for smart phone adoption in 2006 at this point. Sometimes I want it to go a little slower so I can throw more cash at it lol. 
So that is why this sub may seem like an echo chamber. I am sure all new technologies had echo chambers before everyone else "got it."

You will need to have ownership of actual capital. Like shovels, computers, barber's tools, businesses, etc. People in the future will not hodl Bitcoin like we do. I am assuming without central banks, we would have market-based interest rates, so the market will tell you when hodl and when to build/buy with your Bitcoin. If you decide to save with Bitcoin, your Bitcoin will grow in purchasing power because of two reasons... People losing coins and lower manufacturing costs for your consumer goods and capital goods.

That makes total sense. Never thought of it that way. All businesses aren't bad, of course. But pretty much all Bitcoin businesses will eventually go away in the best case scenario. Labor, expertise, and trust are systematically replaced by software. Bitcoin should not create a big burgeoning industry surrounding it. That defeats the purpose. 
This should enable humanity to put more labor towards being creative than to following and enforcing the rules. This should lead to prosperity increases like during the industrial revolution. Call it the Individual Revolution or something.
Edit: Businesses will always hunker down to protect turf. This is why all Bitcoin businesses are suboptimal... Like even if I charged people $20 to tell them about Bitcoin. I would be an opponent of things that would make Bitcoin easier to understand because it would cut into my business. 
The incentives are all wrong for businesses, so we should take everything they say with a grain of salt.

Bitcoin is more valuable because it has stood the test of time and has survived many attacks. The newer cryptocurrencies still have yet to go through all of these things.

Quit begging for laws. If your coin needs laws to survive, then it is crap anyways.
We don't want or need laws to prop up the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin must face the challenge head-on now. It is better than using a law as a crutch for now and then dealing with it later when there is more on the line.

I learned something new the other day, and it gave me a great deal of peace once I understood. Once I understood this, I knew what to do.
Intermediaries are naturally antithetical to a true p2p service. When it comes to Bitcoin, these businesses are intermediaries. They will naturally tend to hunker down, defend turf, increase entrance costs, etc. Businesses want to corner the market. If a business corners the market, then they can be coerced by government or by greed to not do what is in the long term best interests of this world-changing technology. 
That's why they can't "agree" to anything.
That's why we can't let them make decisions about the future of our system. I hope that makes sense.
Bitcoin businesses can be useful. However, they should not be allowed to dictate the course. It's good if a Bitcoin upgrade puts a Bitcoin intermediary business out of business.

It's fun for me to buy Bitcoin, and I want to get in on every dip, so I try to buy a little every few days as my budget allows. I know people who buy as little as $25 worth of Bitcoin when they get paid every week. This technique is known as dollar cost averaging. It takes away some of the risk and rewards, but If you are hodling long term, then the rewards will take care of themselves IMO.

Businesses will always be naturally antagonistic towards what is the absolute best for Bitcoin. Bitcoin should not have a huge, burgeoning industry surrounding it. The point of Bitcoin is to replace labor, trust, and expertise with software. Businesses will always have the incentive to hunker down and oppose things that are bad for their businesses.
Do you get it? If we give them an inch, the incentive is always there for them to take a mile.

Bitcoin has value because people believe that it has value. "Tremendous utility" is something that makes people believe that it has value. "Novelty" is something that makes people believe that it has value. "World-changing potential" is something that makes people believe that it has value. Etc, etc.
These properties cause people to believe that it has value, which gives it a valuation in the form of a price.

I personally think we are giving the government and current system more credit than they are worth. They are not able to do much to stop Bitcoin other than threaten, intimidate, and lie.

It doesn't make any sense at all, but people just lap it up and freak out if you question the system. I think it makes them feel safe or something. Meanwhile, they don't understand that the banks, IRS, cops, armies, all of it is there to steal from them. Americans have it the worst with the worldwide taxation.

Nah. If you like living by laws written on paper, then you don't understand. These laws, regulations, and policies are interpreted and enforced against you by a system that uses violence to stay in power. Bitcoin allows us to financially to exit these systems. Of course these systems cannot survive as-is without their tool of financial control, so they won't be able to enforce like they do today.
It's like keeping training wheels on your child's bike too long. They won't fall as much,  but what happens when the training wheels need to come off? Right now, Bitcoin is riding nicely without training wheels and you are wanting to add training wheels if Bitcoin starts to wobble a little bit.
If your cryptocurrency requires the old system to survive, then it is vulnerable.

What is getting hacked? Bitcoin isn't getting hacked. Exchanges? They aren't Bitcoin.


Have you ever heard of spending Bitcoin? I want to increase my bitcoin with the intention of spending my bitcoin. I am hodling because I believe other people will come to value bitcoin in the future, and it will have higher purchasing power. I can probably get fiat if I wanted it, or I could get a vacation, car, house, etc. You are not even saying anything that means anything.
Speculators are very important to the market and society. Good speculators help direct capital towards "good" projects. "Good" here is subjective to the speculator, but if enough people agree after some time, then the speculator is rewarded.

No. It is bad to steal from people, coerce them, cage them for non-compliance, etc. You should not encourage others to do those things on your behalf. To be honest, it is not a virtue to have a nice-sounding middle of the road philosophy on this. If state actions are bad, then they are all bad. Voluntary transactions are always preferred over coerced actions.

I thought it was just a touch of fanboyism and selfish motives for all the Bitcoin-only talk around here. Then I studied (and lost money) for few couple of months and now I get it. 
The only real use for this technology is for a censorship resistant, trustless store of value. All other features are just nice to have in comparison. The way Bitcoin is working right now is the closest to this ideal. That's why all the smart money is in Bitcoin. If you can think of a cryptocurrency that does better in these areas, please let me know and I will sell my BTC.

@_date: 2017-10-09 22:40:44
Don't worry about it. This is probably the fairest shit in the history of the world. If people hoard bitcoins for themselves, then it just deflates prices. If people are spending the hell out of bitcoin, then it inflates the price. So... Either way when "the haves" spend or don't spend, it is good for "the have nots" as long as they are willing to trade goods and services, because they will get more BTC. So that's basically just how the market works.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:54:58
Do you think there is any chance that they will try to increase the supply and "inflate" Bitcoin by making more paper Bitcoin than are in existence?
Either way, this is all a nothingburger to Bitcoin. ETFs rely on judges, politicians, and armies to enforce them. No matter what happens, I predict it will end badly for anyone who hodls with an ETF. It's totally not the point of a peer to peer trustless store of value, but it should get really good returns for awhile as long as there is no corruption like someone running off with all the private keys.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:04:49
Yeah probably. At the tail end of the adoption curve whenever that happens, but it won't hurt Bitcoin IMO.

Yeah man. Even better. I was thinking about only after Bitcoin is ubiquitous, but your idea is applicable even now. These things could be dropped anywhere at any time and could function as a marketplace. The two people could come to the kiosk to complete the transaction. Think more than just B2C. It could be B2B also as well as a gambling and prostitution hub. I am talking for completely war torn regions or whatever. Folks could know two things about the kiosk... 1. It cannot be tampered with or stolen.  2. The Bitcoin keep their value outside their region. 
3. Their Bitcoin is still there even if the kiosk is removed or destroyed.
The only thing is the on-ramp. Do you have to go to these places and accept some terrible fiat or goats or something to get the initial coins to circulate?
I have an idea... What if these kiosks were sponsored by friends, relatives, and supporters outside the stricken area? That way, when the kiosk showed up, it held balances for people in real Bitcoin that they could access and spend immediately in their community. Cool thing is people could sponsor random people who might not have rich family overseas. You would just have to dip their finger in ink or something so there's no doubledipping. Just brainstorming. Good post.

I think there will be less borrowing and more leases and subscriptions.
Instead of relying on deeds and titles and men with guns to enforce them, you would just use technology to keep control of an asset that you are leasing. For instance, a person leases a car for a time period, and the car automatically returns to the owner when the lease expires.

Not going to happen. We aren't just going to start buying up all the capital in the world. I don't necessarily want a factory. I will be buying goods and services also.
Finally... Possibly.. I don't think huge organizations are necessary and may be counterproductive in the future with Bitcoin. I think people will be more productive and autonomous, and they will reject that many levels of management and just do the work.

When people are able to keep what they save, and capital can move without interruption, and the welafare/warfare state loses power, it will really be worth it to work. It will be like work long, hard, or smart. Choose one. They will all bring nice results and luxurious lifestyles. The market will incentivize real productive work, and we will get more of it

I am of the opinion that all governmental actions are immoral because it involves force or coercion. Only voluntary interactions are moral.
With that said, I believe local government works better than central governments. I believe that more governmental entities are better because people can shop around to different jurisdictions and the competition will cause better government as they vie for subjects.
When we have a thing like the US government that will tax us no matter what state or even country we live in, that doesn't leave any room for competition or escape if things aren't going well.

You privatize everything. We are all eating up a bit of sky every time we go outside. That's our airspace. If the sky is unoccupied by something, then it is fair game.
The way to combat global warming is through wealth. Wealth enables the individual to make choices about what they consume. If global warming is science, then people will adjust their behavior accordingly, as they already have in the west. Don't you want a Tesla, hyperloops, bullet trains, clean energy, telecommuting, etc? This comes from the real wealth (capital) of society. Only the market can efficiently allocate goods, services, and capital to the desires of the most. The government cannot write into law anything better than what the market can do to fight climate change. So let's get the old school governments out of the way and collaborate amongst our neighbors if we wish, always with the ability to walk away. Much better than the current war machine that is required to enforce your laws. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:43:01
Yeah. But buying bitcoin with cold hard cash and then delaying gratification is something too. This enables the price to rise and it gets people's attention and allows them to exit the system with us. Right now, I can't build anything worth a shit for Bitcoin, so hodling and preaching cryptoanarchy to reddit and friends and family is all I can do. Serious question. Do you know of something else a non-coding type person can do? I guess I could learn to code, but I think trying to engage people in conversation may be a better use of my time.

Lol. Forget all that nonsense. 
The most important thing is to secure our coins in the  most antifragile, censorship resistant way possible. This is the most important.
Then we use layer 2 for spendability. If we don't like that layer 2, then we can use a different L2 or not use it at all.
I am assuming that you are just misinformed. If you are, then take this opportunity to study what is actually important with blockchain (hint- censorship resistance). If you are a malicious actor, then please just stop.

All of this is what I would do if I were in your situation. It is my best advice.
If I were you, I would throw every spare cent I can find into Bitcoin for the next three years. Hodl on for dear life for three years. Don't sell. After three years, spend the Bitcoin on goods and services. Don't cash out. I believe if you do it right, you may never have to work a traditional job after age 22 or so.
Take the next three years to shore yourself up. Get in great shape. Don't get in debt. Don't get anyone pregnant. Don't get into toxic relationships. Good luck!

Yeah I totally think you should. I don't know if it will sell you any more vehicles today. Maybe one or two in a year at right now's adoption? But it will memorialize your business as one of the good ones. By that I mean that you accepted Bitcoin before you were forced to by the market, and that you are probably an interesting guy worth doing business with. You should accept Bitcoin and hodl the Bitcoin that you get from your first purchase personally.

There are other countries in the world. Plus, it's p2p, so we don't have to have their permission.
If I have to use FedCoin for something, I will buy it and use it immediately while hodling my BTC. Others will do the same. Any inflation they attempt will be punished hard because people will spend their FedCoin first (Gresham's Law) and it will jack prices up unless they can tax a ton of it back out of the economy.

The people holding a currency with a fixed supply will all gain value as their currency is demanded more.
Instead of the hodlers of the currency getting that surplus, the first-spenders of that newly printed money will get the benefit, whether it is banks, governments, or the credit card user themselves.
So one system incentivizes deferred and careful consumption, and the other incentivizes government force, bank shenanigans, and people willing to take on debt.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:38:21
Yes. On government roads and they were taught at government schools and Universities in some places. Wearing government uniforms. We get it.
Think about this statement: 
The market reveals consumer preferences, not laws, acts, and authorizations.
If the above statement is true, then using deductive reasoning we can know that an inefficient way of distributing capital was used to fund NASA. Each consumer was not given a choice. They were told. And they couldn't opt out. The market would have demanded a different bundle of goods for that money than what was served up by NASA. That difference between bundles is the fucking waste. 
So Fuck NASA. Also, take NASA out and insert any government agency or even government as a whole. They take our shit and waste the fuck out of it. We would not have to work near as hard if we got to keep our shit.
Good news is that Bitcoin is going to make this a reality at some point. I am hoping for financial Independence in three years and world change within the decade.
Edit: Bitcoin is armoring the sheep from people like NASA so that they can get their original bundle of goods, services, and *capital goods*. It's going to be a second Renaissance plus industrial revolution man.

Which cryptocurrency is the hardest to kill right now? Answer that honestly. To yourself is fine.
What is more important as a store of value, features or being the hardest to kill?
This goes along with Andreas Antonopolous's analogy of Bitcoin to a sewer rat. Hard to kill. That's why I keep my savings denominated in BTC.

BCH is not as trustless as Bitcoin. BCH does too much too soon with block weight.

Yeah probably, but still... I don't need them to do anything for me. Lol

Anything in the universe only has "value" because a thinking being gives it that attribute.
Nothing has inherent value. Nothing. It's all imaginary as in it takes place in your mind and my mind only. Gold doesn't know that it's "better" than silver.
Things also have value in time and space. In a desert, I value water. In a lake, I don't value it as much. 
So yeah, we could think about the price of gold as a function of supply and demand or as a function of it's utility. It doesn't matter. A person values Bitcoin more than something else they possess, and a trade happens. Doesn't matter why the person values it, and the whole concept of valuation is really absurd if you think about it. But we do it anyways as revealed through our actions.

Go call for massa. Ask massa what you should do to protect your coins. Everybody need a massa.

Yes. The world desperately needed a way to really secure their savings while being "easy" to use, and was willing to pay for it.

The mental disconnect is strong with the 2x "crowd." 
Just kidding. There's no 2x crowd. Otherwise the price would be higher in the futures markets.

Unless they recognize it as money and use it, then I doubt it will have an impact on price. I hope it acts as a domino and leads to more decentralized government around the world.

I guess all I can tell you is to watch. People are buying these things now.
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:43:14
I'm not against it, and I don't think it's immoral or stupid, but it is a little too cozy with the lawmakers and enforcers for my taste. These paper Bitcoins can be confiscated if the person holding the private keys is presented with a court order, correct?
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:53:07
Yep. Same here. Totally devoid of any strategy other than buy early and often when I can.
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:40:11
Ok. All of the things you just mentioned require Bitcoin to a censorship-proof, trustless store of value. I believe that Bitcoin businesses and miners don't get a say in that matter because they are inherently antithetical to this goal of Bitcoin. That doesn't mean that they are all plotting to take down bitcoin. It just means that their incentives cannot be fully aligned with where Bitcoin needs to go.

According to what I have read, Core was not invited. Also, they can't sign an agreement that is "basically good for all parties." Parties includes users, and manu users don't want decisions to be made in the way that the NYA was made. Personally, I don't like it because I don't trust the people involved. Seem like snake oil salesmen. Cool thing is that they can only blow their load once. People will be less likely to believe the next one.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:46:50
That will happen until people run out of fiat or fiat loses its value. Bad money chases out the good. There's no way to get around it. Other than to survive, people want to spend bitcoin because it is a uncensored payment method, to avoid taxes, portability, or for novelty. 
Hodling has more benefit than spending for people: inflation-proof, intermediary-proof, invisible, as theft-proof as possible...
Bitcoin checks all the boxes already. In fact, bitcoin checks those boxes the best. You are just railing against the way the world is.
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:54:57
Yeah totally except that the US taxes based on citizenship rather than location. If you want to give up your citizenship, you have to give them half of your shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 11:26:45
Don't apologize for guarding your shit from people who want to steal it. You are doing the right thing. You may just want to be less public about it lol. Good news is that you made a government goon out themselves on your thread at least.

Sorry if I missed the sarcasm. Remember that many immoral things are legal. Also, many moral acts are illegal. Don't conflate legality with morality. In most cases these days, the purpose of new law is usually to warp a generally known moral concept for the purposes of the state.
Everyone knows that if a person takes some cloth and burns it without hurting anyone or trespassing, then it's no big deal. Enter "the law" to tell us that other men should put that man in a cage because of a new flag burning statue. 
Also, it is generally accepted morality that if two people want to trade something, then it's ok. Like when our kids switch orange for grape popsicles among themselves. Everyone recognizes that both kids are better off.
However, if adults want to trade, they must first ask permission from the state, then they pay sales tax, are regulated, etc. The law is there to make us do this behavior that we wouldn't otherwise do, and that we inherently know is not necessary.
This would be like if I saw my kid about to trade popsicles with a friend. I run over there and say "Alright. Ask Daddy for permission to trade popsicles." "Ok. Now let Daddy get a bite of both your popsicles for overseeing the trade." "If you don't come get me before every trade, then I will take all your popsicles and put you in your room."
So when you try to tidily sum up the nature of a situation with "Well yes, that is how the law works," that means nothing to me. Actually it tells me to be wary because there is probably some fraud or fallacy when "the law" is cited.

Like on sim city or something? Nah. It doesn't work like that. There is no designer or constitution or decree. It's reputation, preparation, insurance, private security, cryptography, etc. Roads? It would be interesting to see what would happen, to be honest. I know that whatever transportation it is would be way better than what we have currently.
And you have to give up like half your assets to give up citizenship.

Maybe put a widget on your phone that can show you the price?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:20:26
If that starts to happen, the smart ones will see it coming. The dream won't die no matter what it's called.
With that said, I am confident in the future of Bitcoin until I am not.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:12:17
Good post. Don't wait on merchants. They'll come around when they see the potential sales. They are already starting to come around actually.

Spartacus wanted to change the rules for slaves in Rome. He should have just kept his mouth shut and remained civil.

But we don't KNOW that there will be a hard fork. We generally KNOW that the incumbent chain will carry on regardless. So the futures market is fair in my opinion.

Everything you are mentioning at best is neutral in accomplishing hyperbitcoinization. Much of it is bad for bitcoin.
We don't need to be putting a bunch of transactions in the blockchain. We want it to be be accessible to people forever.
So lightning network would be preferable... Even centralized services if you trust them.
Have you ever heard of Gresham's Law? The bad money drives out the good in circulation. 
People want to unload the depreciating money first.
As hyperbitcoinization happens, merchants will advertise that to they "still accept USD" to get business and then immediately sell the USD for something sounder. 
The book I recommend, The Bitcoin Standard, explains how and why a bitcoin standard, similar to the gold standard, will emerge. I can give you a synopsis of that also if you want.
People will adopt bitcoin because they have to in order to protect the purchasing power of their savings.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:48:19
Do we see commercials talking about how gold is a great money?
No. Why? Because no one has seniorage.
Marketing activities are an indication that someone has seniorage of some thing.
Bitcoin will be adopted because people will have no choice if they want to preserve their wealth.
When Europeans went to Africa, they didn't need to advertise to the Africans that gold was better money than beads. The Africans had to switch to gold because the Europeans had seniorage on beads and destroyed the value.
@_date: 2018-12-02 20:02:22
You want people to use bitcoin at merchants. This is against human nature. They will use their USD, which is depreciating. People will use USD until they are out of it.
Merchant adoption is not going to create hyperbitcoinization. Merchant adoption will happen as it happens.

You can buy bitcoin from an individual.

Don't do business with any "crypto" company at all. You don't need to in order to hodl bitcoin private keys.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:29:50
Pretty much everything in your post is wrong.
I suggest that you read The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. That will give you a basic understanding of what makes bitcoin valuable.
Not trying to be a dick. I think you have good intentions but you need to stop talking and do more reading first.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:05:48
Damaging only if they use bitcoin transactions when not necessary. Lightning Network mitigates that.
It's damaging if it takes bitcoin from a hodler and transfers it to someone who will sell it because it creates sell pressure.
It's confusing to tell people that bitcoin is scarce future money and then tell them to spend it on coffee.
Merchant adoption is good if it exposes people to bitcoin and gets people to hodl who wouldn't have otherwise.

Yeah but it's not difficult to help the user if you know a few steps. Shinobi did Coinbase's job that they should have done and recovered the LTC.
