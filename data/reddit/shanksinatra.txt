I know Coinbase has an option to buy every month. They have relatively low fees, but they also charge slightly above the average price.
I just started getting verification for Kraken so I don't know if they have the same setup but I imagine they do.
Just do some research on exchanges that let you buy  with USD and pick something that works for you.

You should do a lot more reading before you jump in. Being informed before making a business decision or large purchase is pretty essential.
I'll regurgitate what I have read, but urge you to read even more.
As far as I know, cloud mining is not great. Bitconnect and Genesis Mining also seem a lot like MLM (pyramid schemes).
If you're going to mine, I heard that joining a pool is the best way to go about it. Casual miners don't make as much (not sure about this).
I wouldn't take a loan to buy BTC because you would need to sell it to pay off the loan.
Again, please read a lot more and become informed on mining before you decide to take the leap.

There may also be a subreddit for that. Check out the sidebar.
Otherwise any selling platform would work. Just specify that you're selling for BTC and after the transaction is verified, you can ship.

I had one in my box, too. I got mine a couple weeks ago.

+1 for buying before. Buy some now, buy some with your dividends (aka selling off your Bitcoin Gold &amp; B2X), buy some after.
I thought about the worth of  BTC in terms of how much USD value it holds for a long time. Now I think of it as collecting satoshis instead of fiat.

First of all, props to you for being a rockstar on answering the above dude's questions.
I have a friend who trades on the volatility. He makes about 2% a day working with a few thousand in capital. He uses a bot to track the changes and manually executes buy/sell orders. He used to run the bot but he's done better with manual execution. He runs the bot off of a cloud server because the data usage is above his ISP limit which adds about $10 a month to the cost of the operation, but with the amount of money he uses, he makes that back in a day.
I'm sitting around 45% gains in value and no doubt he'll pass me, but he thinks in USD, while I just sent to collect satoshis. Different schools of thought. 
TLDR you can do really well shorting BTC if you're diligent and have the money to make the gains worth their time. Most are better off holding.

Three of my transactions took less than 15 minutes, another took over 3 hours. Don't sweat it. If you have a transaction id, you're fine.

I think 8-10k is a much more realistic target for this year. We have seen BTC increase in value, sell offs driving it down some, then more climbing. The trend is upward, but 20k by EOY would be nice but is not likely.
The next month will be a big tell. After the BitcoinGold and B2X Forks, there will be less doubt, but it will stabilize in price as people come back to other crypto currency.

There are lots of threads regarding the fork. Look up Segwit2x or S2X.
Coinbase app has an alert feature. I don't really recommend them for buying coin but the alert is nice.

Check out Kraken and Bittrex.

If this fork follows the Bitcoin cash fork, you'll have two sets of currency. You'll end up with a 1:1 in BTC and B2X (which is what I am calling the Segwit2x coin). Lots of people are planning on selling the B2X for more BTC like they did with Bitcoin cash, but it's hard to say which coin will be the main coin which is.
People recommend hardware wallets because of some issue with Segwit2x and replay protection, but I don't know what it is entirely. I need to read more myself.

You mentioned putting your own money into it. I'm just trying to help you not lose your own money. But our do you, booboo.

Not really. A lot of people complained about the packaging not being sealed. They're trying to reassure their customers in the security of the product.
