So Changetip is Dead?  Maybe now we can go back to tipping Bitcoin like we were meant to, without an intermediary to steal our data.

Really Air BnB?!?  This is the team that brought you sockpuppet accounts to tip and accept tips.  The team that bought supporters by giving them free bitcoin to tip  The team that got caught not releasing their stats because they were too poor.  The team that switched to USD focus.  The team that pissed away 3.5 million dollars.  The team that... well you get the idea.  Really AirBNB you might want to do some research...

I wonder why these numbers are so different.  That's really weird.  I've been trying to research this.  According to Bitgo they have assets in excess of 830 BTC and liabilities of 830 BTC.  
Tinfoil hat on:  Worst case scenario:  If the Liabilities are correct on Bitgo, and the balance is correct in their "offsite storage wallet" than they only have around 346 BTC to payout liabilities of 830 BTC.

[Straight from Bitgo Faqs](  
What are the limitations of the service?
No system of audit is perfect. While BitGo is able to directly verify and attest to Bitcoin assets held in its multi-sig wallets, it cannot directly verify the liability information provided by the company. BitGo must rely on the end users to verify the liability information by checking that their own balances are correct and have been included in the overall totals. If the company excludes certain inactive customers from the stated liabilities, BitGo cannot detect that unless those users attempt to verify their balances.
BitGo also has no knowledge of the state of the company’s overall balance sheet. **It cannot verify that the company has not borrowed bitcoin temporarily in order to show an apparent state of solvency.**

Oddly enough I think it was because they were implementing a 1% fee on withdrawals as of 15 December.

I really hope they're not a fractional reserve.  They outright deny being one in the blog post I referenced.  


To further enhance security against hacking or a server compromise, we keep a small percentage of funds in our Hot Wallet, which is the wallet that withdrawals are processed from. We target this being about 1% of the available pool of user funds.
For the other 99% of funds, we move it off of our servers to a more secure location - our Offsite Storage wallet. This means that if our servers are hacked, the maximum amount that the hackers would have access to is the Hot Wallet (about 1% of funds), which the company will stand behind.  
TL; DR;  Claims 99% in this "offsite storage wallet" and 1% hot.

Maybe "lost" was not the correct term, but either way you look at it, waking up in the morning and seeing 10% less than you did the day before is not positive situation.

Don't know anything in particular about igot.  But a while back there was a guy who created spots the coin and had a site igotspots which was after his carpet cleaning company.  He spammed and scammed and I thought he disappeared.  Maybe this is act two.

I heard a story recently about a band that played in Russia (I think?) and were paid in washing machines, because washing machines were a more secure store of wealth at the time.

Thank you for signing up for Dog Facts!  
Did you know that The Newfoundland breed has a water resistant coat and webbed feet. This dog was originally bred to help haul nets for fishermen and rescuing people at risk of drowning.

Funny, how the US Govt has enough faith in the Bitcoin system to just send 100,000 dollars around in one transaction, and store over 6 million dollars in one address.  All for very low fees and no maintenance cost.

Great to see a tipping app that encourages rewards for content, and time spent viewing content.  This seems to be a logical and effective system for the distribution of micropayments (tips).

What strikes me as odd is that, if the government agent understood bitcoin better, he wouldn't have gotten caught.  It was his lack of understanding (ie thinking it's totally anonymous) that got him caught in the first place.
