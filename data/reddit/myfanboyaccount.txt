Now that's interesting, I've never had it explained this way. In my head I had been thinking of it as, "you mine for XX time to accumulate 0.000000000000001 BTC so over a very long period you will mine 1 BTC, but the electricity cost associated would still be more, usually."
Thinking of it as a lottery system, and the more you play the better your odds makes a lot more sense in the context of whether it's profitable. Maybe I mine 1 BTC every 23 months,  but I have to run and maintain a high powered computer that draws more electricity the entire time. It's not a smart way to make money.
