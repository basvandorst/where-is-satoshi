The price of a bitcoin will never rise past $1200 again. As soon as it gets to $600 everyone will just sell, it will crash, and the same will happen again and again.
I think the amount of people holding bitcoin and using it as speculation will always be greater than the amount of people using it as real currency, and if it actually does rise again the ratio of speculators to users will just increase as well as people realize they can make a quick buck.

Gasp. You're right! I'm a hypocrite. Feels bad. At least it's safer being a hypocrite in the negative, concerning BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:35:00
Circumstantial. A large number of people figured out how to make money from BTC and pumped it up to levels that totally did not make sense. Now everyone else is on the bandwagon, which means the highs won't be as high, but people will still use it as a way to make REAL money.
Down and down we go, where it stops, nobody knows.

Feel free to quote me and shame me if I'm wrong.

Ooh, someone called me bud! I'm so rustled. Sure I've heard of shorting! I suppose I should have said it's safer to be a pessimist.

Wow. Is there a single person here that is willing to admit that they cannot predict the future?
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:42:36
Oh, you're sure. Got some proof? I sure don't. This is why this subreddit pisses me off. So many people are "SO TOTALLY SURE" that X, Y, Z will happen. The fucking stock market has been around for over 100 years, with nigh unlimited data available to dig into, and people are paid millions of dollars a year to predict even the tiniest thing about it, and they fail.

Thanks, I'm not. How can you not see that the majority of people "participating" are just in it to gamble? I don't see the value in that, there are better ways to gamble.

...thank you. Please forgive my melt.
Edit: OK, this is cool. But I will remain stubborn and skeptical, and angry.

Yes, you can find in my post where I clearly state that the price of one BTC will go negative...
I'm 100% sure that a coin won't be worth over $50 at any point during 2016. So my 100% sure cancels out your 100% sure, so THERE! This is what I'm dealing with.

This guy wants us to believe that he won't cash out if BTC makes another break for the moon. Like he won't want to buy a bigger tent for himself, as if.

Ah, I knew that. No sarcasm though I just don't remember posting anything about Jynx...damn I should delete that I don't want people to think I play OP champions.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:06:25
How did you figure out I like Jynx? :)

Thank you. I didn't really know what fiat money was until now. It's these kinds of knowledge gaps that keep bitcoin relatively "in the dark" when the public is concerned (for now). For instance, I was never interested in buying in until I learned through this subreddit that you could purchase in fractions of a coin. If more people had a complete knowledge of how it works I'm sure it would be more widely adopted. Thanks again for being a bitcoin advocate! You're doing good work.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:05:42
Very true.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:50:41
Very succinct and eloquent response, thank you. I agree with all of your points, and I do think that the current usability of btc does not justify its current price.
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:00:09
Thanks! This makes sense. The infrastructure definitely isn't quite there yet but your timeline not only seems plausible, but knowing how industries rise, definitely probable. Fingers crossed.
