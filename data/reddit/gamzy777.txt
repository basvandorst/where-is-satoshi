I like you Freesal, you come across nasty but you must be lonely I would say, I mean, to be on here posting random nasty comments to people who have come across some misfortune sounds to me like you don't get enough genuine connection in your daily life?

hmm, being someone who once burned a friendship with someone in exchange for financial gain, it took about 5-10 years before I actually grew up and realised what I had actually done. I really did regret it and the stain on your conscience once you wake up really isn't a nice thing to carry and it doesn't go away. Pray for him, because he is even poorer than the guy on the street with no money who shares his lunch with other homeless guys.

ETC isn't the problem. The hacker is the problem. Did very well off ETH ICO...and ETC will do quite well over the next 6 months you watch.

Is there a way to view the list of accounts Bitfinex owns? I had 30,000 ETC on a long Margin which would now be about $60,000 profit....and woke up this morning to this mess...
I started with 52 BTC in my trading address here: 3HNSQ47TmVM8zR2bgtWKBnSwirhEYZDvzs  and it has been moved to this address here: 1pWZwXhsrYXUFH8j88smy6FJBDFKk8xQE
Just another entertaining day in crypto land!!

Haha good old crypto gets you sucked in pretty easily. It seems to take over because it does have an element of excitement to it. Actually its funny you say that, about holding things loosely. I was just taught an important lesson with Bitfinex if you don't mind me sharing. It has actually turned into a blessing in disguise. 
So, I made a very good profit in the Ethereum ICO, actually quite a large one, but yet, as many in Crypto, it simply "wasn't enough" - all of a sudden no matter how much I make I find myself wanting more and more, but I actually wasn't really all that conscious that it was happening. So, the other morning when I woke up to Bitfinex being hacked and seeing everything gone, initially I was feeling down about it and frustrated, so in my frustration I drove to the shop, bought a pack of cigarettes and stood there smoking a cigarette and I started talking to God. I said something like, geez God, this is really crap. Whats so funny is that almost immediately after I said those words, what came back and clear as day in my thoughts were "No it isn't, actually things are better than they've ever been. You're way ahead of where you were 5 years ago, you've got a family, people love you etc etc" and the list went on. It really messed up my pity party and brought a real sense of freedom almost immediately. It was a complete relief, considering people are going out of their minds and upset and feeling despondent....just that simple interaction brought Peace, regardless of the monetary loss. So, it prompted me to seek out what my issues with money are, because the more I had, it wasn't enough, but when I made a decent loss like Bitfinex, I found a personal freedom from it. He truly does work all things for Good for those who are called according to His purpose. Here's a good read that I found, such a good article around a psychology with money:

Pretty hard to hold the private keys when you're margin trading - Maybe Waves Platform will solve this with their exchange they are building and make these centralized exchanges extinct.
