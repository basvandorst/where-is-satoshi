I went through it on December 8th, after my original tx was on mempool for at least three weeks. I spent maybe two and half hours reading it through to clearly understand what I would be doing. After that, it was only a matter of executing one step after another. Maybe 15 minutes later, the new tx was on its way, and got first confirmation within 3 blocks.
Just posting this reply to maybe help other people gain confidence in learning how tx are broadcast, how they work and how to bump the fee for a non-confirming tx.

Yes, Bitcoin Core will re-broadcast the tx over and over again. I went through the same situation as you are now.
Read CAREFULLY the whole page I'm linking here. If you decide to follow it through, do it carefully. You will be able to increase the fee.
If you need any help, PM me.

This. Although there are videos for nerds (as Andreas himself says), for entrepreneurs, for simple people, etc, this is THE example I found of his ability. Worth every minute watching it.

You speak better Portuguese than a few friends of mine.

Which wallet did you use for the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:01:27
Buy her a Ledger Nano S.

Hummm... Tricky, then. Anyway, this is the guide I follow on such occasions:

It would be fun (or supporting) if one of the conditions to be the winner was to have a SegWit address.

Glad to help.

In customer figures, the second larger Brazilian exchange. MercadoBitcoin still has the bigger number of customers.

I'm also working on it: educating people through a series of small seminars here in my city to discuss from economics to technological aspects of Bitcoin.
HODL is good; SPREADL is better.

Or you can use a tool like vanitygen: 
But I also think that the best way to learn and really understand what Bitcoin is and how it works is by studying (at least) parts of the code.

You would be taxable as if you were receiving fiat. If it's a service, you would pay ISS, PIS, COFINS and probably withhold IRRF. If it's for goods, ICMS, IPI, PIS and COFINS. In both cases, you would treat this operation as if it was made in foreign currency, apply a foreign trade rate and convert the amounts to BRL to calculate the taxes.
Also, if you keep the BTC and later fiat that out, you would be subject to IRPF upon the gain from the date of the operation until the date of the conversion to BRL.
As an example, let's say you sell a good for BRL 300,00 (BTC 0,01). You would declare the operation of BRL 300,00, including the taxes (ICMS, IPI, PIS and COFINS). If later BTC reaches BRL 50.000,00, you can fiat that out for BRL 500,00, but you would need to declare a foreign currency gain of BRL 200,00 at your next year's IRPF declaration.

What about the term HODL?

Bitcoin can be bought... Money can be earned... The love and admiration between you and your son is priceless.
I would do the same!

This was an incentive for me to setup a Lightning Node.
