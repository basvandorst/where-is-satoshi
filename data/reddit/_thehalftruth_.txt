I did not say "money that you don't have." I said don't invest money that you cannot afford to lose. If you are living paycheck to paycheck with no money in your bank account, don't put the entirety of your next paycheck in cryptocurrency. Don't put a single dollar in crypto that you aren't ok with losing. For example, if you are considering putting 2k into crypto, would you be financially comfortable if you bought a 2k tv right now? If not then don't buy the crypto.

This dude supposedly mortgaged his house to buy bitcoin. He would probably take your comment seriously seeing how uneducated he must be

Because you don't have any money? I sincerely hope you are joking. You have to be

Just hold it for now. Then, learn your lessons. 
1. Don't ever invest money you can't afford to lose. 
2. Don't ever invest borrowed money. 
3. Don't ever buy crypto at an all time high. 
4. Don't ever invest money you can't afford to lose x1000
5. Don't ever buy crypto without doing plenty of research. If you did any research at all you probably would have learned how dumb it is to buy at an all time high with borrowed money. 
 You will probably get your money back if you hold a little, but nobody can guarantee that. Don't do this again OP

I hope this whole thread is a joke. If it's not, then we're all fucked by the stupid money in this market
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:59:26
That was a joke. Don't even think about buying more bitcoin
