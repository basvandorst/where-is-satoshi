Will have minimal effect on price. If anything, the price will rise. Everybody who bets on Bitcoin futures most likely understands the market; nobody will short Bitcoin just because they hate it with a passion without understanding it (except maybe Jamie Dimon). As Andreas Anyonopoulos puts it, the only people who are hedging it are the miners. With the eventual emergence of Lightning Network, it won’t matter anyway.

It’s definitely a lot easier said than done.

@_date: 2019-07-08 03:13:57
Millionaires won’t go out of their way to buy BTC unless BTC shifts their way into their everyday lives. I’m sure tons of millionaires made their money from other asset classes: real estate, stock market, businesses. The way that Bitcoin can eventually shift into the millionaire market share is if they slowly eat away at the institutions that the wealthy millionaires use. Financial institutions are already on board and ready to trade Bitcoin which can then be sold to buy stock almost instantaneously. Imagine the next biggest step - Remax or any real estate brokerage starts exclusively listing properties for BTC. If the property is attractive enough, one by one the millionaires will start heading into the game.

You’re on the opposite end of the spectrum. You can credit your parents for being overprotective and making sure you don’t get scammed or tricked.

@_date: 2019-07-07 19:07:27
Depends on the damages in court. If the remedy is specific performance, then the defendant must issue the 5 BTC he was given. If it’s just money damages then it would be any 5 BTC or fiat equivalent. This can be especially true with regard to tainted BTC in potential injunction lawsuits. The specific performance would be to get BTC that would otherwise not have been tainted.

Technically we rely on custody everyday as we buy on Coinbase or Gemini or any other exchange before transferring them to a cold wallet. BAKKT doesn’t need custody, they just need to have their clients set up a wallet so they can access their own funds and transfer them any time. Doing this will drive adoption. Otherwise it’s no different than holding a certificate saying you have X ounces of gold, but when the market crashes you were never able to liquidate your gold or hold onto them to begin with.

Kiyosaki isn’t exactly the guy to learn from. The guy makes a living reaping royalties from a boom that’s geared towards high schoolers and early college kids.
The best answer is to save enough to buy whenever the opportunity comes or the dip happens.

What’s the purpose behind the quickest way from bank account to BTC? If it is to lock in your buy at a certain price, the best way is to deposit your funds from your bank into Gemini and buy immediately. You won’t be able to have your Bitcoin until the transaction clears in a few days but you get to buy it at the price point you want.

A cryptocurrency was never intended to replace currency (at least in Bitcoins case). Bitcoin is digital gold, and if you venture and take a look at the history of gold, the value of gold actually rises during times of recession.
The fact that third world countries rely on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is an indication that the value and use case is there. If the US ever suffers from another big recession, the effect will be the same.

It seems like a chess match to be honest. While the US is spending their money on military, border protection, and stimulating the economy, other countries are hedging with gold. The 2008 global recession was created almost entirely from the US debt bubble, and eventually created a ripple effect on the entire world. It would be silly to think other countries would want to learn their lesson a second time. In a macroeconomic view, this is what I see.
From a microeconomic perspective, this puts investors in sticky situation. I can probably echo with the sentiments of others that they are confused on what to do. Continue putting it in stocks that have been so prosperous for the past decade? Buy gold or Bitcoin to hedge? Save USD in a high interest account? Seems like the best thing to do is to do all three if possible and slowly dollar cost average more and allocate more to each asset as it drops.
It is important to point out that while Venezuela relies on Bitcoin, the recent political crisis actually sparked a tremendous amount of arbitrage with USD and using US credit cards for payment systems by merchants. For those who are sitting and waiting for the USD to collapse are forgetting that tons of countries are still hopelessly pegged to the US dollar.

What makes you say that? Holding on to cash is a smart move if you see an economic downturn where the investments are posting negative returns.

Warren Buffet has amassed tons of wealth from recessions in the past and I’ll give credit where credit is due. However, his faith in the American economy in general has ultimately led to his competitive loss. He failed to invest in emerging tech sectors that can potentially disrupt various industries, he failed in invest in companies that stood for the younger generation, and he failed to perform due diligence in researching what impacts millennials in general. The only thing he understands and knows very well is the commodities and necessities market.
He even went so far as to publicly claim that he has Berkshire company, while made tremendous gains over the years, has not held a candle to the returns by the Vanguard Group. He states he’s holding on to a tremendously large amount of cash waiting for the next investment but the truth of the matter is he’s holding onto his cash for his own self greed.

What makes BTC a fantastic store of value is general consensus. So long as everybody abides by the general consensus that 21 million will ever be produced, then it’s a good store of value. For this very reason, BTC will not fork to increase the total maximum because it’s been done with other altcoins, and has failed because users simply do not trust the general consensus of users if the fork to ever keep that cap or that they can contribute to the network as well as BTC does.

“Stealing your wealth” can take many forms. It’s not just the money sitting in your bank account not earning interest and sitting idle, that’s just one example. Even if you have been investing for 30 years and have done significantly better than inflation levels, the fact of the matter is that the cost of living progressively gets higher. You’re beating inflation because you see your investments are significantly higher than inflation levels, but still loses purchasing power ever year.
Bitcoin doesn’t lose purchasing power, and there is no inflation. All you need to do is hold onto it and you will be incentivized for doing so.

I understand that Guancarlo came out and admitted the futures trading market affecting the price as such, but please bear in mind that only Bitcoin is affected by futures trading. What’s stopping thousands of other altcoins from pumping if they’re not on futures trading?
Now bear with me while I put my tin foil hat on. Bitcoin maximalists will hate me for saying this but... this is why the altcoin market is needed. If we only have one main crypto in BTC, then it can be manipulated. Having other alt coins help BTC in the long run in terms of beta testing development and and alternative protocol to use until the dust settles. That’s why Litecoin is needed in the crypto space. It’s always been the test bed for Bitcoin. Either way, I still believe that the market will play itself out and Bitcoin will ultimately go to $10 million, and its going to happen faster than we imagined with other economies toppling into negative interest rates and US following suit.

I would like to invite you to Just think for a second. You really think that the established power players in the Bitcoin protocol are going to let the likes of Joe Shmoe create a crypto and get better adoption than Bitcoin? The infrastructure of power players is built. The elite Bitcoiners have been established. The centralized and decentralized exchanges have all been built using Bitcoin as the primary digital currency.
You’re also assuming that other crypto’s can become mainstream for whatever feature they have. When the time comes, if whatever feature other crypto’s have that has been proven to be successful and safe, then Bitcoin will have reached consensus and adopted it anyway. 
Units of Bitcoin are already measured in Satoshis right now with Lightning Network implementation. When hyper-bitcoinization happens, nobody will say Bitcoin is worth a million dollars. They’ll simply say it’s worth 10 Satoshis.

Developers contribute on Github, and any person can be a “developer” so long as the code is accepted and implemented by the majority. 
If you are in fact a BCH advocate, just consider the fact that BCH is a hard fork, yet miners did not switch their hashpower to mine BCH or other coins. This is a testament to the fact that BTC still has more value and will continue to have more value than any other cryptocurrency chain.
@_date: 2018-06-26 21:09:15

By the end of the year 2021, the Bitcoin price would hit anywhere between $300k to $350k depending on market sentiment. I believe it’ll be closer to $350k though due to numerous factors. We are already seeing the start of a global recession and all signs are pointing towards it. Japans automaker brand Nissan reported 90% profit loss in Q1 this year. Netflix tanked on Q2 earnings over fears of global growth slow down. Many countries have dipping interest rates, some of which became negative already. Germany’s interest rates dipped to 0% for the first time in history. The US Fed lowered federal interest rates on a 25 point basis and there’s a high probability it can lower even further due to tariff concerns. 
The last point regarding the US lowering interest rates won’t sound like much (esp. because the concerns are stemming from tariff concerns), but Trump halting a booming international commerce so abruptly has consequences even after a tariff agreement. The GDP has slowed down for the US in Q2, and those who live in the US can already see the repercussions. Trump thinks that by enforcing tariffs that jobs would come back to the US but the only positions opening are Fortune 500 companies who are holding positions open for a vast majority who doesn’t have the proper skill set and training for them. This can only get worse as time goes by until it hits hard, most likely by EOY 2020 already.
The second biggest factor for my BTC prediction is based on the principle of return on investment. When you have a global stunt on GDP and growth, the amount of safe haven assets becomes increasingly difficult to quantify. During the 2008 recession, trust was placed on real property in the US, particularly heavily populated cities as a means of growth in assets. Real estate heavily propped by the wealth of the baby boomers and Gen Xers, and as the generation slowly fades away, Millenials do not share the same craze over owning a home. Because of this, the housing market (particularly for single family homes) will reach a bottom, and that basically leaves no asset that is safe. During periods like this, safe haven assets will be the most important - Bitcoin and gold. Both BTC and gold will appreciate to unprecedented levels and both can coexist as a store of value not only for the general populous, but for governments as well.
@_date: 2019-08-12 06:07:57

So is that why many countries are heading towards a deflationary controlled economic growth? The governments are the ones pushing inflation because they want people to think their countries are prospering while in actuality the world population is pushing for lower prices goods and services as they age. It literally is population and citizens v. Governments. This type of parallel monetary system called Bitcoin is an option to opt out of the traditional financial system that has long been dominated by central banks that have no discipline.

You think it’s new growth, but honestly it’s very much still manipulated. The beauty of Bitcoin is that everything is transparent unlike the gold markets. The physical gold itself traded in dollar amounts on exchanges are not transparent because the physical gold isn’t present. On Bitcoin exchanges, just look at the order books. So long as you see but walls and sell walls of numerous BTCs at some weird price ending with 20 cents or 28 cents back and forth show you that the whales are just still trading back and forth to get BTC at lower prices and sell at higher just to get more and more.

It’s not an investment... when you convert Euros or USD to a different countries fiat for the sole purpose of spending it, are you investing?
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:40:38
Logically, If we enter a recession, USD is actually considered a store of value. Other countries will either flock to gold as a store of value, Bitcoin as a store of value, or USD as a store of value. However, here’s where the problem occurs. Where USD was once considered a store of value, it’s economic and gdp concerns right now and the pressure for the feds to lower interest rates just means that there will be more QE in the near future. It’s almost a downward spiral because there will be a point where QE will be implemented so frequently that USD will start losing value. When that happens, that’s when you know Bitcoin and gold will skyrocket. The US will be forced to adopt to a Bitcoin standard as preached by many as a complete last resort, and will be forced as an attempt for people to gain faith in USD value again.

I think EVEN if tether is backed legitimately with USD, it’s actually doing Bitcoin a disservice by tethering the price to USD. It means that Tether alone, if it gets big enough, can suppress Bitcoins true value because USD is the default value everybody talks about for buying and selling Bitcoins.
I got into this space to see Bitcoin as the universal currency. If anything, USD should succumb to BTC value by being measured in Satoshis, not the other way around.
I also dislike the talk about governments regulating crypto and people think that this is good news. Again, it should be the other way around - Bitcoin should regulate itself based on consensus. So far, the only prominent figures I have seen that shares the same universal outlook is the Winklevoss twins.

Assuming A is the correct answer, that’s still incorrect because a checking account deposit is a deposit into the bank and not useable until one withdraws money or uses a debit card to do so. Both actions do not signify the use of money.
Assuming a debit card as the right answer is incorrect as well because it’s not even a form of money.

In terms of theories, don’t worry too much about it. The facts are simply placed on the table and what everyone knows so far is that the Bitcoin protocol is only growing, Lightning network is only getting started. Remember, the correct thinking is not getting into Bitcoin for the gains (that’s a plus), but to start a revolution that keeps the banking systems in check.

The problem with crypto is that while they can create time locked contracts, they can’t create conditional contracts. There’s no way for a blockchain to know exactly when an event occurs to trigger passing of the funds. However, I was thinking in the future if people’s lives and accounts are tied into AI via Amazon, Google, bank accounts, etc. maybe it can work if they created a contract that would pass the funds on to their heirs if all of their accounts tied to AI are inactive for a few years.

Once you stay in the Bitcoin ecosphere long enough and obsess and read about it enough, you start putting the pieces together. Some of the information you’re seeking for there’s already answers to.
-Bitcoins early history and prehistory dates back to when a few developers were working together on the Bitcoin protocol. Many devs contributed, but Satoshi Nakamoto basically set up the framework for it. Craig Wright is hellbent on proving he is Satoshi merely because he worked on the Bitcoin protocol with Satoshi early on along with Hal Finney who later passed away. Other devs were contributing from bitcointalk.org or their irC channel, which consisted of devs who were contributing as well along with merchants like Charlie Schrem from BitInstant.
-The decision to stay anonymous is most likely because the creation of a monetary system from scratch would create public controversy and governments would stop it from the very beginning. Staying anonymous was imperative.
-The Bitcoin Foundation was started by a group of early Bitcoin contributors, but has since been in jail or stepped down, and subsequently became insolvent. I actually strongly believe that they need to start up another non-profit Bitcoin foundation to spread the word of Bitcoin and use funds to educate the masses.
Lastly, I believe the anonymity stems from the development itself. Many are claiming that Bitcoin is internet 2.0 because it’s not controlled by a central figure. The internet itself stemmed from military communication databases and scholarly databases connecting to each other to acquire information quickly. Bitcoin is an attempt to essentially connect a collective database together simply based off of users running a full node. We don’t know what the future holds, but every transaction to me right now simply seems like a rendition of sending data from one to another without borders or restrictions.

Don’t worry. It’s okay to question it. Just know that the offchain scaling solution paves way for many other use cases such as Schnorr signatures, atomic swap, LN, and so forth. Onchain scaling is essentially entrusting miners to verify your transactions, and this can lead to exploitation, 51% attacks, spamming the network with their own transactions, and miners essentially being the banks of the crypto world we despised in the traditional banking system.

Two ways to interpret this:
If Bitcoin is made by the most powerful government in the world meaning the US, then they will effectively only have 900,000 Bitcoins, which is still less than majority share and thus they cannot control consensus.
If Bitcoin is made by the most powerful government in the world meaning the power of the people of the entire world, then Bitcoin is indestructible, battle tested, and decentralized to the point it will only be a matter of time before it’s the most trusted.
It’s most likely the latter but even if it’s the former it doesn’t really matter at this point.

I don’t think anybody can tell you this answer. All we know is that from Bitcoins accelerated parabolic growth, dollar cost averaging over time is the way to go because it can go from 9k to 100k in a matter of 3-4 months (as witnessed in 2017). That’s why it’s just as dangerous to time the market and buy at its lows rather than buying consistently over every month or two weeks.

Or you accumulate high and sell even higher. Bitcoin would never be this high in the first place if it weren’t for another holder selling at a higher amount. If the hodlers never sell, then the only ones losing out are the ones that think they’re selling high to the newbs who don’t care what the price is.

The big institutions are steeping in because of the economic uncertainty that looms in the United States currently. The stock market hit an ATH just to pull back, trade war uncertainties, and the recent Fed rates. Because the fed rates stayed the same, it’s an indication that the economy is not doing as well as it is supposed to be doing given the Unprecedented QE from 2011-2015. Now that they’ve been implementing the quantitative tightening, coupled with inflation, this is the perfect storm for Bitcoin. And what a way for Donald Trump to help lead the way!

I see the price of Bitcoin going down in USD terms because right now BTC is mostly tethered to USD. However, because USD will drop in value, the fact that it’s one of the strongest currencies in the world that is going down will signal a price boost for BTC. It will adjust to present day value taking inflation into account, so either USD will inflate so Bitcoin would hit higher than projected values or USD will decrease in value and thus Bitcoin would still be of increasing value. Either way USD values will adjust to it.

Simple UI meaning while some apps are designed for people’s privacy and transactions, there should also be competing companies who are doing the opposite and making it easier. For example, a Venmo type app that lets others transact and instead of using public key addresses, the address is shown as “Johns account” or “Sally’s account” or “Restaurant A”. I think people are confused right now about Bitcoin because half of the people are pushing for transparency, while the other half is pushing for privacy. In order to flourish, both needs to be readily available and let the users decide how they want to spend their funds.

Everybody talks about the killer use case for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. One of the biggest, if not the biggest use cases is actually donations and giving back.
The more people are willing to give away BTC and crypto to others allows other people to learn about it, adopt it, and choose to hodl or give to others.
Ultimately, I believe the BTC community will find its way and learn that giving a minute fraction of your BTC away actually helps so much.

I personally think that’s never going to happen because BTC will never stabilize in value; it will constantly be changing. That said, I think that’s what BTC was exactly designed to do - an attempt to equalize the entire worlds assets, currencies, and commodities into one monetary value, the Satoshi. Until that happens it’ll constantly be sporadic and changing which I think is a good thing.

@_date: 2019-12-03 06:08:11
If you are as bullish as they come, then you aren’t bullish enough or your are concentrating in the wrong areas. This is a chicken and egg problem - you have to get people to trust Bitcoin as a secure form of transaction for funds (i.e. fiat) before Bitcoin can alter different asset classes. So far, Bitcoin has already been commingling with stocks when apps such as Cash App allow you to move your fiat into Bitcoin or buy fractional shares of a stock. Once Bitcoin is able to take a percentage of market cap of the stock market, Bitcoin and slowly transition into real estate holdings, and other asset classes. Bitcoin just has so many use cases that it’s too big to fail at this moment in time. As long as Bitcoin captures merely 5-10% of every asset class, that’s already enough to see a wide use case.

Seeing as to the recently privacy changes with YouTube, it’s pretty telling that it was Google that started censoring and removing these crypto YouTube users and accounts.
Bitcoin WILL solve the problems raised in his post (at least partly) because:
1. Bitcoin allows for message transactions that cannot be censored unlike Google.
2. Financial privacy can be obtained with future developments on Bitcoin, and personal data isn’t really stored on blockchain so that doesn’t really matter. At least it’s not a centralized company like Facebook, Amazon, or Google collecting user data.
3. Bank fees are way higher than Bitcoin fees.

Not with the example you gave. What other crypto’s and Bitcoin Cash doesn’t understand is that using crypto for everyday purchases doesn’t make the currency valuable. Using crypto to purchase high value items and collectibles will. This holds true when people transact on the base layer for security purposes. Bitcoin is so highly priced that it makes sense to use Bitcoin when transaction in real estate purchases, collectible art or goods, lamborghinis, or anything of high value.
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:17:27
Yes, I was referring to the latter. Bitcoin is basically used as a medium of exchange for collectible goods, cars, art, and one of a kind items. Real estate was one example but it is in essence a one of a kind property.
Once this happens, Bitcoin isn’t seen as a transaction for an everyday good worth a few dollars, but something that is sought after.

There’s a difference between trying to ban Bitcoin and actually doing so. Governments may try to ban it, but will never be able to successfully do so. Killing the value has no effect, because if the government has trillions of dollars to buy BTC, refer to the free market capitalism post.
Any government willing to buy trillions of dollars of Bitcoin just to ban it does so at their loss, unless they actually want to acquire the Bitcoins just to sell it back out themselves for a premium, which would not tank the value but instead do the exact opposite.
People who forget their seed are the ones losing out on BTC. The government will never be able to buy Bitcoins off others who hodl and never sell it to the governments.
Sometimes I think at this whole Bitcoin protocol system and the game theory behind this is absolutely amazing and unprecedented. Bitcoin is not going anywhere forever, and if not, for a LONG LONG time.

@_date: 2018-03-11 18:04:12
I’m sorry but I would have to disagree because there are too many factors and facts that stand true today that contradicts your theory. I remember when I was first introduced to bitcoin by my friend, I thought the same exact thing you did and was worried about the same exact thing. From the time that I got my first satoshi until now there has been nothing that indicates bitcoin will be banned, and regulation will be very tough for these reasons:
Banning Bitcoin:
1. Venezuela and India tried to ban it, but they didn’t because they can’t. Venezuela even did a 180 and accepts all crypto, including their own petrol token.
2. China wanted to ban Bitcoins as well around August 2017. Didn’t work well for them so they retracted and said that they want to control ICOs to prevent fraud and protect consumers.
3. The US is perhaps the most pro bitcoin as other posters have mentioned. Despite catching Ross Ulbright for running Silk Road, the US shut down the site, but even allowed the seized Bitcoins to be auctioned off to the public. It’s clear that the US has no intention of banning it from that instance on. Any attempts to ban it now comes with a grain of salt and is unconstitutional as an ex post facto law and a bill of attainder.
4. Like others have said, Japan and Switzerland are going all in on crypto so no problems there.
5. Certain countries are making crypto tax free if you live there.
The major takeaway here is that you don’t see the free market capitalism movement in Bitcoin. Everybody in the bitcoin ecosystem is greedy for more coins and money, but you know who else wants a piece of the action? The greediest of all - governments. Why would country X and country Y agree to ban Bitcoin if they had an advantage not to? Japan’s smart in going all in because Country X’s banning of Bitcoin is Japans gain and advantage.
As for regulation, we all knew it was going to happen when it nears adoption so that is a moot point. The question then becomes: even if countries decide to regulate bitcoin, what effect will it ultimately have and will people follow it? It’s important to view Bitcoin as gold in this instance. Is gold regulated? (I’m not sure about the question I asked so others please enlighten)
1. These KYC and AML laws are in place internationally already and recognized by the governments in opening exchanges and regulating exchanges. That doesn’t stop somebody from trading person to person, or any other form just as a person trades gold.
2. The thing I worry about most is the exchanges marking their bitcoin TX numbers so they know the next person to receive Bitcoins from the exchange. Only problem is that there are many ways to circumvent this.
Bitcoin cannot be banned. Bitcoin can be regulated but it’s the same extent as trying to regulate gold; people can still circumvent the regulations if they really wanted to. Sorry for the long post but I had the same exact thoughts as OP but everything so far has dispelled those thoughts and notions.

There are already a lot of competing cryptos currently. People will classify Ethereum differently than Bitcoin, or other utility tokens differently than Bitcoin. However, it’s the ability to transact, to store value, and to retain value that counts. Keep in mind that Bitcoin is able to adapt to new changes given consensus. At this point, so many people have developed on top of Bitcoin to create pairings to BTC and numerous apps that I think it’s safe to say that it can only go up from here.
Because Bitcoin is not necessarily a tangible physical good, it needs to survive social attacks, lies, and deceit whether it be from other crypto’s or government. If it can persist and overcome these struggles, then that only makes it more valuable than any other form of currency or metals. Also bear in mind the US adopted the gold standard before and we all know how that went.

The game theory is what makes Bitcoin do valuable in the first place. As much as majority hashrate miners are hated, they do have a place and a role to this game theory. Take away the mining and as dad as it is to say the value will plummet.
Bitcoin HAS to be attacked forever in order to survive and get stronger and learn from the mistakes. If it doesn’t then merely switching algorithms is a means to the end of the revolution of Bitcoin.
Instead of switching POW, they need to figure out a way to level the playing field, but giving enough incentives for competition.

 Think what made Bitcoin so popular was the price (November 2017 to Dec 2017). But prior to that, what made it so popular was what it stood for: Decentralization. If you hear Mike Novogratz interviews, the reason he got into it is because he pictured a decentralized economy. Bitcoin has no loopholes or refutable points as to what it can do. Lastly, it got so popular because this decentralization meant freedom to a lot of citizens from third world countries trying to escape from the likes of tyranny and communism. In essence, as much as Bitcoin was touted for having a bad rep as drug money and what not, it’s kind of giving freedom back to the people. So Bitcoin is saving humanity! :)

Honestly, there is so much scaling with Bitcoin right now there is no possible way it doesn’t go to $250k plus within the next few years. The first wave of users have adopted to it; the second wave is not institutional users... its more consumers who are fleeing from a depreciating dollar no matter where they live due to a global recession from the negative interest rate environment.
@_date: 2018-07-28 04:06:47
The governments was control. The institutions want ETFs and securities. The laymen who doesn’t know crypto want answers. The holders want value. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is determined by consensus. It’s always been that way and will continue to be. If the majority of people decide it’s currency, then it will be currency. At the end of it all, all signs point to Bitcoin being something you want to have; no matter what the use case is. Period.

This is absolutely correct. The least Bitcoins in circulation to buy, the less it can be in essence manipulated. The whale who keeps buying and selling eventually will lose out bits at a time to holders and their stack will just get less unless they’re in the mining industry. Just keep buying and holding my friends.

One thing that kind of stuck with me when I first learned it is that it’s kind of like an email address that lets you send Bitcoin to any receiving email address.

This is very disturbing to me. I'm question Bitmex's solvency with regards to these derivatives. I'm not surprised that they are trading derivatives when they don't have the Bitcoins or assets to do so. The whole point is for Bitcoin to become the predominant asset when other countries' economies fail. Gaming derivatives like this in a market such as Mexico only makes Bitcoin drop with the economy's downfall. This is exactly what Bitcoin is trying to prevent...

My price predictions may be wack or wild, but you have to face reality and understand the geopolitical climate that is going on. You do bring a good point that people are scared of losing money, and they are less apt to speculate it on digital gold, but the question then becomes this: when shit hits the fan, do you want to be lugging ounces of gold around? Can that ounce or gold nugget you have be divided to purchase items? Can you flee a country with gold in hand? If you say that people are buying precious metals, are they buying metals certificates of ownership? Because that can go south just as easily if you don’t physically own it.
We are in midst of a divide where people are skeptical of Bitcoin and the governments, but just don’t know who exactly to trust. Hopefully people will wake up and see that Bitcoin was never about getting rich, it’s about asset protection, even from 3rd world country governments that pry precious metals from your hands by force.

You’re preaching a chicken and egg problem. A 51% attack is only possible with centralization, and the only way to reach decentralization is through time; it can’t be forced. Bitcoin has been battle and attack tested because of this very reason. It’s hard to imagine another token or crypto that can earn the stripes and trust that Bitcoin does.
Don’t get me wrong, there will be other alts, it’s just that the altcoins will be held by choice and not by necessity like Bitcoin. Everybody’s laughing about an Amazon coin or Apple coin but that’s the catalyst needed for people to adopt to alts.

@_date: 2018-04-06 02:10:01
Don’t worry OP, just remember Bitcoin’s value is derived from what they holder believes in the value. Don’t sell or use it because you believe it’s worth or going to be worth $1,000,000.
I’m sick of all these exchanges basing the price of Bitcoin on transaction volume for their particular exchange. I do see that the only reason they would is because they need a physical way to validate what it’s worth.
If you still don’t believe that it’s worth money or you’re losing out just know that someone out there is willing to pay a 10-20% premium on the Localbitcoins site. The mere fact that this arbitrage opportunity is possible just shows you that the prices from wherever you’re seeing it, whether it’s Gemini, Coinbase, or even CMC is complete and pure BS.

You have it the other way around. The reason people need to have their own wallets is so that companies like Conbase don’t hold your crypto like a fractional reserve bank.

The year is 2022. Amazon is one of the biggest leading companies that dominates the entire US and possibly the entire world. There’s a coin that’s hovering between  and  on the market cap called AMZNcoin, which relies on its strenuous POW algorithm. However, because it’s closed source and centralized, nobody can buy it and only workers of Amazon are issued these tokens (similar to the locked 15million coins NEO has for its development team). Because of this, the workers are still incentivized to swap the AMZNcoins to Bitcoin. Thus, AMZNcoin will be worth $5,000 per coin while Bitcoin will enjoy this market cap surplus while sitting pretty at $500k.

I believe Bitcoin is in a position to undoubtedly succeed. It’s only a matter of time. For those who are saying that people will exit cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has positioned itself so that it’s tethered to the US dollar through stable coins, and is tethered to the tech from the likes of people in China using their phones and paying everything through Alipay and WeChat pay. The US hasn’t kept up with mobile payments system, and China has yet to create a stable coin to tether the Yuan to BTC. When both these events occur (and it’s only a matter of time), Bitcoin will inevitably be the safe haven that nobody will shrug off.
