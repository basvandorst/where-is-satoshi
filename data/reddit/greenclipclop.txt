Bitcoin scalability development failed, that's what happened. The other guy that replied instead attributed this to larger bitcoin volume, and he's right, but he's twisting his answer to suggest it's not a problem with bitcoin. 
Bitcoin doesn't have the infrastructure to support its current traffic. And the devs and mining community are in disarray and disagreement on how to go about solving the problem.

Isn't this nearly $100k each?

I think it's because the bitcoin core development has failed.

You are you aware that bitcoin core development has failed? It takes 15 mins for a transaction and a lot of them take over a day. Also, bitcoin is supposed to be a platform for dapps to be built upon. Can you name any dapps built off of bitcoin? I cant. I'd like to hear about some and how they're going.
On the flip side, you have Ethereum. They are implementing proof of stake and their core dev is strong. And all dapps I've heard of on based off Eth, not Bit. 
Good luck

You only know that because the foreigner replied and said he was foreign. Stop being a sjw for the sake of being a sjw, asshat

Do you have any sources on such a claim?

If there could be an easy 51% domination and takeover of the main blockchain, why hasn't anyone done it?

Isn't this the problem with bitcoin and why it's eventually going to fail? 
You can't wait 15 minutes for a transaction to go through in a store or restaurant.

So it only hinders because you have to download the copy to get started setting up your node. Is that right? I'm new so I'm trying to understand

So whenever bitcoin gets segwit it'll have similar throughput as eth?
But it will have a smaller blockchain you say. Does  the blockchain size affect anything at all?
