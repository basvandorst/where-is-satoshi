art style reminds me of that old french sci fi cartoon with little human types that get captured by Oomen creatures which were basically weird humanoids, eventually the little humans attack the Oomen but mostly they're kept as pets or exterminated...I forget whatever that movie was called. Oh and the other one that was like it, whatever it's name was

i've had some issues with funds disappearing but managed to convince support to return the funds. other than that weird crazy $300 scare that took a week to resolve i've enjoyed buying stuff at 29% when bitcoin is booming (best to go lower like 26% to lock in that price when btc is up)

the benefits are that people don't generally think about those externalities; a dystopian future and China's policies are very far removed from most people's financial decisions. What they do consider are  JPM coin's benefits, such as for ex.: cash back, bonus rewards points, they already have an acct. with JPM, better loan terms, better credit score, safety of an established bank, the backing of the federal government. It's things like that that motivate, i.e. incentives, a la David Hume's Is/Ought : "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.' That is to say, rationality doesn't always factor into ppl's decision making, instead people are motivated by incentives and desires. And so, by appealing to what ppl want, JPM will be an extremely powerful contender, possibly defeating Bitcoin at it's own game....

the time traveler said, in the long run it's all just bitcoin and land
@_date: 2019-02-15 21:07:46
sure but the logic of that has limits. i hate to beat a dead horse but 1btc=1btc, in the same way one dollar maintains it value. we could of course flip your logic on its head to state $1 loses 9x% of its value relative to btc over a different time period.

\&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the only advantage left for Bitcoin is its immunity to government/third party intervention.
haha, no, that's so very wrong. Bitcoin has many other advantages.

Verry cool! Question: what other websites did you consider when building this? I.e. what other websites influenced your building this? [Blockchain.com]( has some similar data available, did that influence you? Ty
