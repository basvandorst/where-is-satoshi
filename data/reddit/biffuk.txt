More of a no-show than a shit show, but yeah.
Block size debate will rage on for a while I think. Even BCH can’t decide on how big to have their blocks - bitcoin ABC suggesting that they would increase max size again in their 12 month road map. When will it end?! 
If only bitcoin had some forward thinking, innovative technology in the pipeline that could provide a long term scaling solution ;)

Is any company director stupid enough to be complicit in committing fraud to the level suggested in the report / by bitfinex’ed?
*IF* this is true, then is the allegation that the Tether tokens aren’t backed by a corresponding amount of fiat, or is there meant to be some overly complex financial instrument involved a lá credit crunch / Lehman Bros? What would be the incentive for a well performing, market leading exchange to do this?

Ok, so let’s assuming they’re making billions now. Bitcoin has increased in price c. X10 since Tether has really hit the market. If the aim of their fraud was to increase the price of BTC in order to increase their fees then that would assume that they were making 100’s of millions beforehand. Why the hell would you risk serious jail time at that point?
In regards to the second part of your paragraph; if every tether is backed by a corresponding amount of fiat, then THERE IS NO ISSUE / FRAUD. However if tether amount is not equal to fiat amount in your bank then it’s fraud. I’ve met some shoddy accountants / auditors in my time, but anyone would be hard pushed to argue “market forces and negligence” was the issue. Make no mistake, if there’s fraud being committed on the level suggested and in the incredibly simplistic way you’re outlining, then people will go to jail. Have a google of Bernard Madoff.

@_date: 2018-01-25 00:40:24
All the exchanges mentioned involve shady dealings and “disappearings”. The allegations aimed at Bitfinex/Tether are just straight up, long term, easy to prove, fraud - which can be directly linked to the global (American, European etc.) leadership team / directors. 
Your examples involve mismanagement which then lead on to shady fraudulent behaviour where it would be way more difficult to pin the fraud on the donkey - this would explain why someone might be more willing to chance it.
The Bitfinex / Tether conspiracy is direct management fraud. The risk:reward for the allegations just don’t stack up. 
Help me understand the ‘why’.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:00:04
Sure, but in the context of your original comment, the point stands;
Hardforking the protocol != Blockchain fork
I.e a perfectly coordinated change in consensus would not lead to a fork. However, I agree with your point to the extent that this would be very very very difficult to achieve. Stick on the road map and give everyone enough lead time, then you can get pretty close - e.g Monero’s hardfork in Jan.
However, the hardfork risks are real, look at the mess Garzic made of SegWit2x!

How large do you consider these ‘large’ blocks to be that don’t lead to centralisation? 8mb blocks might be ok, but how long until we need 80mb or 800mb etc. How long would each block take to propagate through the network? How much storage will we need to maintain a full copy of the blockchain? How much bandwidth will I need to stay a part of this revolution? Block size doesn’t  scale with exponential adoption. And for those saying that tech development will fix that... isn’t that what LN tech is attempting to do?
There’s also the question of control. Regardless of whether or not you like the people that are committing the most code to Core, by placing miners in control of the only lever available to scale BTC, you are effectively handing them control. Bad actors in the mining market are able to flood the mempool and drive up prices and collect a large percentage of the fees themselves. LN attempts redistribute control between miners and the nodes/users.
Appreciate what your saying about the centralisation of hubs, but I think we’re more likely to see an acyclic graph over time as nodes open more channels and leave them open for longer.

My point is that you would never be able to stick that as a point of reliance in an audit report - they would need to get comfortable with the whole crypto ecosystem.

This is awesome news! 
Not sure how/why it’s taken this long to provide a simple cash audit, but I’m incredibly relived. 
Whatever happened to bitfinex’ed?
I posted this as a response to a comment below, but going to copy it here.
Reads like fairly standard engagement letter ass-covering to me, especially considering they’re a law firm.
FSS is confident that Tether’s unencumbered assets exceed the balance of fully-backed USD Tethers in circulation as of June 1st, 2018.”
They concluded this by undertaking a check of cash at hand in the bank accounts vs number of tether tokens issued at that (random) date - this is a fairly standard audit procedure (source; ex-auditor). I think the main risks not covered are that;
a) there are more tokens in circulation - my guess is that it’s this part that’s difficult to audit under GAA standards 
b) they have other liabilities (loans) which should be netted off against the cash balance but are undisclosed.
@_date: 2019-08-12 13:52:28
I’m trying to point out to you that the bank is benefiting from me simply depositing my money with them. 
I.e a retail bank NEEDS me to deposit money with them in order for the business model to work. No deposits = no money to lend. They therefore offer a free banking service to encourage me to deposit my money with them. However, I understand that the relationship is symbiotic in many cases. 
Have a look at the business model of a few of the “challenger banks” coming through in Europe at the moment e.g Monzo

If the only thing that will satisfy you is a fully blown plc standard audit then I think you’ll be waiting a long time.
Do you honestly give a flying fuck if their cash flow statement for 2017 is a true and fair reflection of the business. Do you give a shit if they’re accurately recording their executive remuneration packages? Why would you want to know if they’re keeping up with their CSR pledges?
Tether aren’t publicly listed, you’re not a shareholder, you don’t have a right to demand this information.
Use your head son. The risk to us and the crypto ecosystem is that they were printing un-backed Tether tokens. I’m now pretty comfortable that they at least have enough cash in the bank to cover the tokens. 
The remaining risk (as I stated right at the beginning of this thread) is that we’ve only seen half of their balance sheet - we don’t know for sure that they haven’t taken out loans in order to produce the +ve bank balances. The issue is that in order to cover the liability side of the balance sheet - an auditor would also need to be able to express confidence that they know exactly how many Tether tokens there are in circulation - good luck asking Deloitte to provide an opinion on that.
If your reply is just another link to what an audit is, or why having an audit is better than not having an audit, or how this isn’t an audit, then just don’t bother - I get it, you want an audit but can’t tell me which specific part of the audit is important to you.

Ok, can you tell me how you would go about testing that there are the stated number of Tether tokens in circulation using GAAP? Bearing in mind that if you call it an audit and use a principle that turns out to be incorrect, you could be sued for insane sums of money... 
They didn’t call it an audit, but stated the procedures used, which I can tell you align with the major steps in a cash audit i.e
They tested number of (sworn) Tether tokens in circulation &gt;= consolidated bank balances. 
Can you tell me which steps exactly my naivety is causing me to overlook. Please explain the risk that you’ve identified and how Tether might exploit it - otherwise all you’ve picked up on is the fact they didn’t call it an audit.
Edit. Spelling.

Log on to Gdax.com (using your coinbase login - they are run by the same company). 
Transfer (instantly) from coinbase wallet to Gdax
Set up a stop order at just above current market rate to avoid fees.
