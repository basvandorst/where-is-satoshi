I say, let them fail. Most Bitcoin fans are proponents of the free market, and we've opted for a unregulated currency model PRECISELY for that reason. 
If you were against the big bank bailout, you should be happy about what's happening to MtGox. This is the largest free market experiment we've seen so far, and no matter how it turns out, once it's over, we'll all have learned something from this. 
Either it takes Bitcoin down with it, and the free market will have failed, and we can all go home and sulk a bit and then write our congressmen to demand more regulation. 
Or, the free market will find a solution, and Bitcoin will bounce back from this, stronger than before. In the meantime, it sucks for everyone who has any significant amount of money invested in Bitcoin (me included). But hey, we all knew the risks going in, didn't we? So no crying. Learn from your mistakes and move on.

I'm one of those people who are definitely out of the loop, so allow me to ask a potentially stupid question:
How come, with all the smart people involved in Bitcoin, no one was able to foresee this capacity problem?

Did no one ever do the math to see what would happen if Bitcoin reaches a sizable population?

Why else would they be required to do KYC? I'm relatively sure that if you buy some coins on Coinbase, they'll keep a record of what address they were disbursed to.


They don't need to keep a log of where I sent my coins *after* I bought them. The blockchain already does that. As long as they can link a purchase to a specific customer and Bitcoin address, if LE subpeonas your records from Coinbase, they can trace all your transactions from then on out.

That's like saying in 1995 that the Internet is about being your own ISP (own server, website, 24/7 connection) rather than being a dialup user. 
Not everyone wants to be a full fledged member of the network. Some people (a lot, actually) just want to get the benefits and are willing to pay a small fee to those granting them access.
@_date: 2016-02-16 10:55:21
I was talking about transaction fees. 
As the blockchain grows in size, it will become more and more difficult to run a full-fledged Bitcoin node. Especially on smartphones, the size is prohibitive, but that's where Bitcoin has a lot of potential. 
So just like with the Internet, if Bitcoin is going to gain large scale acceptance, there are going to be many users who want to make use of the network's capabilities without the responsibilities of being a full member. And they may very well be willing to pay a reasonable fee to offload the responsibilities to someone else. 
So yeah, just like a bank. Or an ISP.

Also, calling my post “shilling” is really just name calling, which makes me seem biased and disingenuous, when I’m really just providing objective information. 
In reality, *you’re* the disingenuous one here, defending a recommendation for a coin that’s easily traceable and *already* subject to government blacklisting to an organization that is fighting *against* oppressive government censorship and defending free speech.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:22:46


@_date: 2019-09-21 23:54:30
Okay, first of all, when you say this


And then, after some spurious reasoning that mostly seems to revolve around your misunderstanding of buzzwords and marketing terms, proceed straight back to ad hominems, I’m not holding my breath that this is going to be a very fruitful discussion, but okay, let’s unpack what you said inbetween. 
Your first point is about censorship resistance and how Ethereum supposedly fails to deliver on that. Your main point being


Okay. What’s the censorship risk in value transfer? Someone may not want you to send or receive money from a certain person, or restrict the amount of money you are able to send at a time. See: current national restrictions on wire transfers and the amount of cash that can be carried across borders.
How does Bitcoin solve that? By distributing the consensus between many different, competing block creators, meaning that if someone wanted to explicitly restrict certain transactions, they would have to acquire 51% of the network in order to do so. This makes extremely cost prohibitive and thus impractical.
Now, what about Ethereum, and your assertion that there is no risk of code censorship? Ethereum supports smart contracts in addition to value transfers. In the same way that someone might want to restrict transactions on the Bitcoin network, someone may want to restrict execution of smart contracts on Ethereum. A competitor, for instance, might benefit if someone’s smart contract execution got delayed or not even run at all. 
But Ethereum distributes consensus in the same way that Bitcoin does, and so, while someone might run a node that just drops certain contracts, another miner will pick them up for the gas rewards and add the execution result to the chain, and the fraudulent node will have no choice but to accept that block, if it wants to stay part of the network. Again, a 51% majority would be needed in order to keep certain smart contracts from running, and thus, code censorship is averted.
In conclusion here, you’ve presented an argument that is completely nonsensical, and can therefore be dismissed as a criticism on Ethereum. 
Now as far as your other points go, I can’t say anything on the design issue (UTXO VS. state model), because I am not that technical. As far as Ethereum not being able to run anything efficiently, I’ll have you know that I’ve recently successfully created a CDP on MakerDAO and minted some DAI, as well as loaned out some ETH on dy/dx for interest, and both worked fine, apart from hefty transaction fees. 
So yeah, scaling is still an issue, but I like said, that’s something that’s being worked on, and it’s also an unsolved issue with Bitcoin. 
In summary, I cannot find any useful or coherent criticism here that cannot also be leveled against Bitcoin. 
PS: As far as the “pre-mining” goes, you do know that Satoshi gave himself a nice, hefty chunk of coins right in the Genesis block, do you? Of course the creators want to benefit from their invention, as is their right.
@_date: 2019-09-11 16:47:01

Viruses, Trojans, Malware, Keyloggers... should I go on? I think it should be very plain to see that on normal computers, “code censorship” is the norm rather than the exception. Both Windows and MacOS block the execution of any apps without a digital certificate by the developer in the default configuration. 
This is an invalid argument. 


Okay, then by the same argument, Bitcoin is bullshit, too. Too slow, too inefficient, never gonna be practical. 
Apart from the UTXO thing that I can’t comment on, the rest of your rant seems to revolve around the censorship issue again, which is a moot point, as I hope I have sufficiently shown by now.
Sorry, I can’t find any basis in your arguments for the assertion that Ethereum is a scam, unless Bitcoin is, too.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:18:52


I’ve used MakerDAO and dy/dx recently. Not for production, just as an experiment, as I understand this is all pretty new tech and may still have bugs in it.
But while that may be so, I say it looks promising. And I don’t see anything similar being done with Bitcoin, probably because Bitcoin is too simplistic in order to allow for such uses.
I other words, there is definitely something Ethereum can do that Bitcoin can’t. And probably won’t.

Correct. Ethereum is an open system, anyone can build what they want on top of it without having to pay any licensing fees or whatever, and it isn’t run by a single company either.

@_date: 2019-09-23 18:30:30
I still think you’re missing the point of Ethereum entirely. Likely because you’re so focused on censorship. BTW, as far as censorship resistance goes, you’re better off with a privacy coin like Monero anyways, as Bitcoin is already being censored (see recent news about blacklisting addresses that are suspected of being invoked in drug trafficking).
There are many applications for which Ethereum is a poor choice, and that’s where the “world computer” metaphor breaks down. You wouldn’t use Ethereum for any high powered number crunching or other stuff that generally benefits from distributed computing. That’s not what it’s for. 
Ethereum enables a world-side, trustless financial system governed by smart contracts, without the need for banks or central governments. The fact that such contracts are published openly on the blockchain allows you to vet the source code before using any such contracts. 
Bitcoin may have a built-in scripting language, but it’s far too simplistic for enabling most of these applications.
Finally, I am still having trouble understanding what you’re actually arguing for. When I say “Ethereum does this”, you claim both that that’s useless, and that Bitcoin can do it as well. 
Bitcoin and Ethereum are really more similar than they are different. Ethereum is just Bitcoin with a few more features. If one is a scam, so is the other, and if one is useful, so is the other. You can’t have it both ways, that’s crazy talk.
@_date: 2019-09-21 20:59:28
A bunch of links do not make a good argument either. I didn’t watch any of the videos, but the articles are also mostly full of vitriol and scarce on facts. 
That Medium article was written under pseudonym and is from 2017, and while the ICO boom was definitely ripe with scammers, most of the other concerns have turned out unfounded so far. 
That subreddit has a single poster, which is the guy who owns it. What a joke. That hater is just mad that he never came up with anything useful or popular. 
From what I can see, Ethereum has *by far* the most advanced dapp platform on the Internet, with stuff that actually works AND is useful these days. There are issues with scaling, and tx fees are getting incredibly high these days, but Bitcoin suffers from the same, and arguably is doing a worse job at combatting them (*ahem* Lightning Network). 
I’m still a bit uneasy about Ethereum 2.0, moving to PoS and all that, but as far as usefulness goes, Ethereum seems to outshine Bitcoin at the moment. 
Full disclosure, I hold both coins, in about equal amounts, so I’m not trying to play favorites here.

@_date: 2019-09-22 02:56:39
I feel like either we're getting into the weeds here or you are really good at trolling, because I'm starting to lose my mind here.
Why would you want to execute malware or keyloggers on your server? Why would Ethereum only be good if you could do that? Is that really what you are trying to say, Ethereum is only good if you can run malware on it?
The point of Ethereum is not to be a "world computer". That was a metaphor used by some people to explain something that isn't really easily explained or understood by most people (who already have enough problems as it is to wrap their heads around Bitcoin). 
The point of Ethereum being able to run code is so you can program smart contracts, i.e. accounts that are governed by code instead of people. When you send funds to such an address, the smart contract will execute, and then something or other might happen. Usually it dispenses some kind of tokens into your account, which you can send back to the smart contract in order to get ETH back, but it could be any number of things.
And while the language IS Turing-complete, in order to stop malicious developers from DoS-ing the network by deploying contracts that never finish running, you have to pay gas fees for the computing power that you use. When the contract runs out of gas before it's finished, it's aborted and you don't get a refund. In that way, there actually IS a "sort of" censorship on the network, one that ensures that no one deploys an infinite loop or other nonsense.
Also, smart contracts are really limited in what they can do. There is no I/O, disk access, graphics stuff or whatever. Basically, all a contract can do is some sort of accounting. Again, you may call that "censorship", but it would really be missing the point. 
The point of Ethereum is not to avoid censorship in terms of what code can be run, only in terms of *who* can run code (everyone) and for how long (until the gas runs out). That's what the "world computer" analogy is about. It's a single, distributed blockchain, hence all resulting state is global and distributed. Yes, it's really, really slow and inefficient, but it's not meant for high speed number crunching, it's meant for essentially running some custom accounting code, something Bitcoin can't (easily) do. 
Or, to put it in even simpler terms, on the Bitcoin network, there is a single unit of accounting (i.e. Bitcoin), and the only operations possible are add and subtract, while on Ethereum, you have an arbitrary number of units (i.e. tokens), and a Turing complete set of operations. So if Bitcoin was your run-of-the-mill pocket calculator, then Ethereum is a Ti-82. Yes, that's also quite a terrible analogy, but I think it's sufficient to get the idea.
Anyways, I think we're in the doldrums here. I don't know if you can't understand or won't understand, but I have a feeling you're really just throwing around a bunch of ten dollar words without really understanding what you are talking about. You *think* you do, and you do so with much fervor and conviction, but you're really just hating on something you don't understand.

Friendly reminder that Monero exists.
Bitcoin, with its public ledger, will never be censorship resistant. Everyone can see how much was donated to HKFP and which addresses the donations came from. 
By profiling an address you can cross-reference it with other transactions made from that address and get a good idea of who might own it. If your address ever becomes linked to your person, goodbye privacy.

This right here. Gold is valuable because it has a long history of being considered valuable, therefore people trust it will remain valuable in the future. Gold has endured many forms of "attacks" on it's value, for instance, the Middle Ages, where many an alchemist tried themselves on synthesizing it from cheaper raw materials. 
The main risks to gold's value, namely, a method is discovered of making it cheaply, or vast, previously unknown deposits are discovered, remain until today, however, because they both have failed to materialize in many years, the trust in gold as a value store remains high. 
Bitcoin is going to have to establish it's trust in a similar way. There are some theoretical attacks on it, and for the foreseeable future, people will continue to try to implement them. The degree to which Bitcoin can withstand these attacks will determine how much people trust it, and whether it will become a more widely accepted method of payment in the future.
