Depends how old you are and your future earning potential. My generic recommendation without knowing your circumstance would be to cash out $300k worth. Keep $50k in fiat for 1+ year living expenses and put the other $250k into something super conservative. I'd ride out the rest of the btc, perhaps withdrawing some at certain $ milestones so you can mitigate risk of ruin. 
If you can get it up to $2mm you can cash most of it out and live pretty comfortably for the rest of your life if you take the time to understand personal finance and safe withdrawal rates. I'm pretty bullish on btc tho, and have a high tolerance for risk, but I must say you have like 100% of your net worth in btc and that is insane.

Bogle has warned about predatory fund managers for his entire career, all the while revolutionizing index investing so that the average retail investor could avoid getting soaked by outrageous fees. You don't actually know what you are talking about.

Safe withdrawal rate is 4%, and in some cases even that will fail. You can run historic simulations on fire calc. Obviously past results are not indictive of future returns but it's a neat tool for wrapping your head around risk of ruin in retirement

A house (personal residence) is one of the worst investments someone can make. So many better ways to earn a higher roi than to purchase an illiquid asset. Also buying a house with cash with these super low interest rates is not a good idea.
