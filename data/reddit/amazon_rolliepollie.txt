What would happen to the cryptos if say Trezor and ledger went out of business and didn’t make these products and software anymore? 
I’m new and trying to learn some more

I was in my molecular biology lab when I checked and saw $19k + and screamed “what the fuck” really loud. Then proceeded to have a conversation with my professor about BTC. HODLLLL

Saw this ad on my Instagram. Wonder how it’ll hold up compared to ledger and trezor when released.

It all depends on the real estate. Not all are created equal. Yes, your typical residential home is not an investment, but actually a liability. 
10/10 I would choose multi-family real estate over BTC any day. It is truly THE best asset you can have.

For residential, what people don’t understand is that after 30 years and decide to sell they have this X amount of money from the sell. But they don’t realize the cost to gain the equity in their home. (Expenses, insurance, taxes, principal/interest...etc). So in all actuality you are losing money. Then you gotta realize it’s only “profit” if you keep the money, but you gotta find another house to live in. So if your house appreciated that generally means so is the area you are in which is where your “profit” is going back into. 
Where as commercial you get paid monthly and the tenants pay for all expenses.
I love crypto, but nothing will ever replace a hard asset such as real estate
