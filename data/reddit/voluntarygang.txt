You obviously have zero experience with legacy banking. Code won't help you there if the code you'd like to use is forbidden.

And where would I do that? Oh that's right, on a centralized exchange. /facepalm

I don't know what you're talking about, it still says "CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER &amp; CHAIRMAN, BITSTAMP" for me.

What do you mean, until? If you don't have an MSB license and you exchange more than $3000 USD per year, you are already breaking the law.
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:05:44
I bet by using magic, right?
@_date: 2015-01-06 10:08:23
No decentralized solution can work on the scale of an exchange such as Bitstamp. It is not possible.
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:36:14
And who will guarantee and pay me that 1 USD if I want to withdraw it?
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:44:54
People can't seem to grasp this ^. I'd love to see a decentralized exchange but that's wishful thinking at most as it's NOT POSSIBLE on the fiat side, ever.

In other words your proposal is worthless as a solution to the problem of how to run a decentralized fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin exchange.

The title was bait, you didn't read the actual post did you? :))
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:27:36
Unless they are willing to sacrifice potential profit to cause disruption? You don't think that is possible?
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:47:52
Well no, that isn't factual either. Read the whitepaper, miners determine the consensus around which blockchain is the truth(it's the longest) within the confines of the Bitcoin rules of course.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:13:05
Yes, but difficulty recalculation happens based on the number of blocks not based on time. And if the time to find a block falls to lets say 2 hours on avg, it will take a long time of really really slow blocks to get there. This is the problem we will likely face.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:41:22
Read again, there isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:33:13
I find that to be unrealistic, I would love to be convinced by core developers that it is doable if need be.
@_date: 2016-02-11 09:58:38
Lots and lots of misinformation and people not fact checking.

Just remember people, you get to choose if you want to stay with Bitcoin or move to this altcoin Bitcoin Classic!
It's on you and no one else. You can choose to receive data from miners that run Bitcoin, you can choose to trade on exchanges that run Bitcoin, you can choose SPV wallets that run Bitcoin and you can choose merchants that run Bitcoin.
YOU CHOOSE. Choose wisely.
