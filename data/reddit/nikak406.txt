I used both Ledger Nano S and Trezor. Both are just nice.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:41:10
I don't believe that. Buy now.
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:14:39
Yes, and also there is a possibility to divide one satoshi to micro-satoshis using soft-fork, so there will not be a problem with this issue

Ledger Nano S is completely safe on ANY environment, i.e. use your windows or mac and don't treat will shit

I'm in Ukraine, I'm buying on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:47:58
I have Ledger Nano S for Myself and I used Trezor also. Both are nice and almost identical in features. Ledger is not opensource, but it uses chip more reluctant to physical reading.
My choice was drived by the fact that Ledger looks just like a flash drive and will not capture anybody's attention.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:57:28
I use localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-01-16 10:00:24
YEAH. LocalBitcoins rules.
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:26:24
It works like a torrent, that can write on itself
@_date: 2017-01-11 08:58:00
It is reliable. It has number of features for advanced users.
Actually, there is a small choice of good wallets.
Blockchain stores your private key for you, which means it can be hacked and you'll lose your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:18:30
coinomi is also good one
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:11:26
Everyone can transfer money to any address. Keep your address private.

Well, you may go bankrupt this way
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:10:28
Yes, you can
You may also restore any HD wallet to Ledger Nano S from seed.

Only Japan can hit price to 50k. Japan is 7% of world economics. What I mean - bitcoin has room to grow. 
But 1MB blocks is a kind of a problem, I can agree with you with that.
@_date: 2016-12-15 10:03:04
Yeah, Electrum seems to be good option, thanks for the idea.

100 million of people * 200.000 USD savings each in average * 5 % / 21 million bitcoins
You may change some number to any direction, but the period stays the same.

Attacker should know xpub (HD-wallet public key) and at least one private key (regular bitcoin private key) to compromise other adresses

I have Ledger for myself and Trezor for my wife. I like Ledger more. 
Recovery option is completely onboard on Ledger, so you should not worry about that.
What I do not like about Ledger, is you cannot watch your balance or get receiving address without connecting the device. You can, actually, export xpubs with specific tools, but it is not essential way.
What I do not like about Trezor is that it looks like a Trezor, and can be confiscated in airport, for example. Ledger looks just like a flash drive, not suspicious.

You should be informed, there is no mandatory retirement payments in Japan, everybody just creates pension banks accounts on their own will and choose. So, they can just choose bitcoin.

Great post, but next time have a think about not-native english readers. Too many rare-used words.

If you are using Ledger with Mycelium, it saves your public keys and you can see the balance offline. If you are using web-interface, there is a chrome app, it doesn't show you anything.
Trezor can show you balance offline both with Mycelium and Web. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 11:45:15
Keep all you bitcoins offline, HODL and have faith.
Sell the part you cannot afford to lose now

1. They are in Poland.
2. They answer email rarely.
3. Save id of blockchain transaction and write them an email about that.

1. Create HD seed with 12 or 24 words, write it down, put it into safe.
2. Consider buying Trezor or Ledger.
3. Consider probability of fire in your house - Cryptosteel?
4. Consider probability of the whole safe stolen - your seed should contain secret that you will remember in five years (some words switched, for example).
5. Memorize your seed - it is not so hard as it seems. This adds another layer of safety to your bitcoins
6. If you are going to use old android phone - weep it, encrypt it, set unlocking pin, set spending pin. Don't update any app but mycelium or whatever app you are going to use to hold bitcoins. Battery should be full - recharge it once an year.

They just have several options for laser engraving for black/light or colored result.
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:54:03
Just trezor it.
@_date: 2016-10-04 06:35:14
You are treating trezor wrong. 
You should be warrying what happens if you lose your seed (in case of fire or steal). In that case you can restore all money from your trezor. Just give it to you mom for storing - if somebody gets it, he will do nothing because of a pin.

Okay, give me your address
@_date: 2016-07-12 13:59:26
Probably, you made too low fee on that transaction. I had this problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:00:33
Silliest advice ever. I want to lock it from myself also.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:59:12
Very stupid. We hold money in bitcoin, don't you think this can hurt the future of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:09:26
You need to dumpprivkey first (google how to do it) (better if you do it offline)
Than create new transaction on coinb.in with HIGHER fee.
Than sign it with your private key from dumpprivkey (on coinb.in)
Than broadcast this transaction on any public broadcaster (ie localbitcoins.com)
New transaction will be marked as double spend, but you shouldn't care. 
Feel free to ask if you stucked anywhere.
