PascalCoin addresses this, though I'm not sure I like their solution.

That was quite a logic leap you made there.

The Vancouver ATM is from Robocoin. The others are not ATMs. Despite their names they are just vending machines.

It doesn't have to always be the case. Switching hashing algorithms could negate the centralization of hardware. But admittedly it would be tough getting network consensus on that one. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 11:47:07
I certainly appreciate your concern.

According to Mises, there is no such thing as intrinsic value. I prefer the term utility value. Gold, Bitcoin, and the USD all have utility value.

The way I understand it is that the bitcoin never "leaves" the blockchain. I think of it as a series of IOUs that keep changing hands until the channel is closed at which time the net of all the transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
But I am far from an LN expert and may completely misunderstand.

I did educate him a bit, at least around the news he heard and why Bitcoin can't have a single owner.

Yeah, that's what he was confused about.

Personally I'd buy back in 25% of what you sold at 19k now at 8k.

Isn't Blodget legally prohibited from anything resembling currency, securities and commodities trading due to his former legal troubles?

What makes you think that USD is "real dollars"? It is just as virtual as Bitcoin. Maybe even more so.

I gave each of my nieces and nephews their age as a percentage of a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:47:47
It's very easy.  On the front of your computer there should be a button that says "eject".  Press it.  You should see a cash tray slide out from your PC.  Place as many dollar bills on that tray as you wish to use for your bitcoin purchase.  Gently push on the tray until it closes.  After a few odd sounds and a bit of grinding, you should see BTC show up in your bitcoin wallet.  If after 40 minutes it has not shown up, you have probably been hacked and it is gone for good.

Swing by San Pedro and I'll buy you a beer at Pedro's... with Bitcoin.

I guess I considered it a Blodget swipe as he's CEO and Editor in Chief of Business Insider.  I guess it should be clarified in the article that he did not personally write the one.

Buy your flights on Cheapair, stay and eat at Pedro's Inn, play on the water with San Pedro Water Sports.  Just about the entire Belize vacation paid for in Bitcoin.

Good point. I think their web guy mostly copy and pasted from the press release, hence the link.  I'll let him know to tweak it a bit.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:05:07
This is a good point.  So that would place the last projection at $420 instead of 4k.  Article updated.

Working for me.  It's a squarespace site, so probably not down.  What browser are you using?

I do qualify it with "At the risk of simplifying things too much".  If I went into too much detail and covered all the bases, the article would have been boring, unreadable and went on for way too long.  
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:54:17
It's a squarespace site using mostly standard templates.  I'm guessing if there is necessary scripting going on, it must be on their end sine I've not added anything out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:16:59
Pedro's Inn still takes them.  You have to pay at the office though.  If you stopped in the bar, the bartender probably just didn't know anything about it.
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:14:21
IMNAL, but it does seem like FinCEN would consider you a money transmitter.  That means that if you were trading anything other than small amounts among friends, you probably would have to register with FinCEN and get licenced by the state you are transacting in. The "under the radar" amount likely varies by state.

UIGEA only makes it illegal for financial institutions to fund online gambling.  It doesn't make online gambling illegal.  Bitcoin does get around the need of using financial institutions to fund online gambling.

For a non-technical author, I don't think it's that far off base. I certainly don't see any problems major enough to alter his conclusion.  Even if you fix the minor inaccuracies it cannot be refuted that there is a photo of his wife with a large fish that he previously published.
