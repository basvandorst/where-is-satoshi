The next halving will dump even more the price of Bitcoin, because the rewards are cut in half and it costs too much to produce one Bitcoin. For example in 2020 the price has to stay constantly above the costs of mining (that have doubled) in order to incentive the miners to continue mining. Costs will be between 8k and 10k, so price has to stay always above this level, difficult I think. This trend will worsen in future. 2028 only 1.625 btc per block and so on

Think also about the demand, if people don't want to buy Bitcoin at 100k the price stay where it is
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:43:27
I am stupid you say? I think you should reconsider the way you speak to people. Respect others opinions and don't take facts 100 % for granted. Only because something is limited in supply doesn't mean people will actually buy it. 
The model of stock to flow is known, the future theoretical price action of Bitcoin also, then explain me why people are not accumulating Bitcoin, if it is certain that Bitcoin will be worth hundreds of times of where it is nowadays?
Please frequent a university, get some degrees in economics/finance and come back and then we can talk at the same level

I personally like Bitcoin, but I think that the majority of people are like brain washed. Yes its clear, Bitcoin has the highest 10 year return and so on. It is an old technology and it started a new era. There are a lot of positive things about Bitcoin and I am not against it. But I think its not logical and wise saying that Bitcoin will grow infinitely by having each year a higher low. What if the price of Bitcoin reached its peak at 20k in 2017?
Then about the halvening. The cut in supply will decrease the amount of Bitcoin miners receive and it will heighten their break even point; why the miners are not selling today their coins at double the cost of today? It’s the market that decides the price and not the miners, so it’s the same after may 2020, miners will mine and they will sell at whichever price the market decides. If the market decides that Bitcoin should stay at around 7/8 k dollar then miner will leave, because to mine one Bitcoin it costs 16k dollar. Miner need a price that stays constantly, from may 2020 to the future, that never goes too much below 16k. If only we have again a bear market like in 2018, where Bitcoin touched 3/4k, then miner will leave 100 %. The system will become more unsecure and we will se a chain reaction in the market, people being disappointed and selling. 
There are too many open questions, nobody has a clear answer, only facts based on historical data. That’s not enough for me.

Lame are the people that think Bitcoin will hit 100k or one million dollar, people that think Bitcoin will substitute fiat in the future, not people like me that think a moment about what could really happen with Bitcoin.
You are all sheeps following blindly the ideology of Bitcoin without even thinking rationally, and hope in making easy money because you couldn’t be early Bitcoin adopters and millionaires right now.

If you look this way Bitcoin will have always have the same buying power. If a Bitcoin one day will be at one million, then a desktop pc will cost around one million dollar. It’s always the same thing. 
People against Fiat money and for Bitcoin, but they are measuring Bicoin in fiat. Pathetic.
@_date: 2019-12-17 23:27:51
How dump are people, all believe in an infinite growth of Bitcoin -.- If it dumps they say: „Buy the dip, it will never go much lower”. If they do technical analysis they only look at positive things and believe only in that. They attack people that make critics and so on. Cryptospace is no longer a healthy place, Bitcoin itself was destroyed and is destroyed right now by those crypto fanatics.
Edit: It’s obvious that I get downvotes on this post, only ridiculous moonboys
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:14:11
I am not against Bitcoin itself, I like the Blockchain, made also my Master Degree Thesis about Bitcoin and I invested a bit in Bitcoin. I am only stating that a lot of people here believe that Bitcoin will reach one million dollar or 100k usd only because it has a limited supply and the next april/may it’s supply growth will half. I want to tell them that it’s not 100 % sure Bitcoin’s price will rise in the future. Nobody can predict the future, but everybody has to take into consideration other scenarios like miners leaving, governments “banning” Bitcoin, quantum computing and so on. There are a lot of other factors that should be considered.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:43:39
Because Bitcoin is an addiction. Sell half your investment in Bitcoin, enjoy the money and hodl the other half until it reaches very high prices or 0.
@_date: 2019-12-31 10:16:16
Then tell me who will mine Bitcoin in the future after the x-halvening, when the Bitcoin reward will be a fraction of one Bitcoin (a few hundred usd at current price), if he price doesn’t follow? Maybe all moon boys like you will mine with thousands of dollars loss.

The fees to buy a Bitcoin are high not the fees to send them -.-

Nobody will enter crypto having seen the bubble that burst in december 2017. Crytpo was new in that year, now crypto is well known, only a few people want to invest. There will never be the craze that happened two years ago. Promoting adoption has no sense, you cannot change what people think about cryptocurrencies. 
In June this year Btc had its bull run, then there was the altseason from august to october/november. Now we have to wait, but if the halving of Bitcoin does not go as expected cryptocurrencies will disappear slowly.
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:29:22
The supply of Bitcoin is already limited, think of all the Bitcoin that were lost and that are hodled. After the logic of supply the price should now already be at 100k
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:32:39
It’s priced in, because it’s the hottest topic about Bitcoin of the last months, talked everywhere. Nobody is talking about the future halvenings, so they are not priced in. Indeed the price increased 2x from its low of december 2018 and it made a mini bull run in june. Now the price is not moving a lot, because it seems that “everybody” has found out about the halvening. The price not moving a lot means that the information was fully absorbed in the price.
To understand more about how the price is affected by new informations look at the efficient market hypothesis and event studies.

You have forgotten to mention Amd (38x since 2015) and Cd projekt (10x since 2016)

Bitcoin cannot grow infinitely guys, don’t act like Bitcoin is the only asset that did well. There are hundreds of stocks that did better than Bitcoin in the last few years.

Are you insane defining fiat money prison coin?! Be happy to live in a world where luckily we have not a world war yet and you live and have a job and a safe place to live.
If the world adopts Bitcoin there would only be chaos.
I bet if Bitcoin should reach one million dollar, how you all fantasize (just saying, it will never happen, even it’s ATH will never be reached) then you will sell all your investment for fiat money and spend this money. Say the truth just like everyone here, you are here for making fast money and you are here for the fiat money.
Bitcoin is prison coin, you get brainwashed and hodl until your initial investment is worth half or even lower.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:02:26
Be honest guys, crypto is harmful. How many people lost all their savings because they were fomoed by some crypto guy in the web? It’s not a financial advice, but hearing all these crypto speculations influences people. It’s like gambling.

Taken from the internet: “Market efficiency,
it is considered that derivatives increase the efficiency of financial markets. By using derivative contracts, one can replicate the payoff of the assets. Therefore, the prices of the underlying asset and the associated derivative tend to be in equilibrium to avoid arbitrage”.
Maybe for this reason in december 2017 we had a bull run and now the price is more flat.
@_date: 2019-12-30 20:49:47
It’s highly probable that it will be like Litecoin, I don’t see how it could be different, the same event. Mining reward going down, miners leaving, demand going down and price going down. In Bitcoin it could be even more drastic than in Litecoin, since in Bitcoin there are far more people involved and if they shut down due to not making profits price will respond heavily.
One day we will come back to cpu/gpu mining, as the mining reward gets to a fraction of a Bitcoin and the price does not go to 100k usd to sustain all the costs involved.
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:10:34
It is a matter of demand. If nobody wants to buy Bitcoin at actual prices it will dump. Something scarce has no value if nobody wants it
@_date: 2019-12-28 09:38:41
One Bitcoin over 8k usd on this atm

Hodl to zero hahaha
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:11:13
Then lets see what happens after the halving, price will either go very high as people expect or it will go towards 1/3k. I think more the latter case.
The problem is that the majority of people in crypto are BTC hodlers, they hold their Bitcoin until they have realized that it has already halved in two since the last high of the year, they could have sold and bought back double the amount. In addition, there are not a lot of new investors that come in the market. In conclusion, if the price of BTC is dumping, there is not enough liquidity to let the price grow.
@_date: 2019-12-29 10:41:53
I totally agree with you, at the beginning every not listed asset has an abnormally hig return when listed, because the price before was non-existent.

Bitcoin is easier to buy then a stock
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:47:36
Maybe becuse its easy to bring the price from a penny to thousands of dollar, but its impossible to bring it from thousands of dollars to millions? Don’t get fooled, invest in something else, but not Bitcoin, it’s too late
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:22:44
A hacker sold all the Bitcoins of an account, that had I think around half a million coins, for one penny
@_date: 2019-12-07 20:25:29
interesting video, but an asset growing from one penny to 1000 dollar is easier to achieve than from 7000 dollar to one million. For Bitcoin to one million we need a huge amount of capital and if it will happen, then it will take more than the time depicted on the graph
If there is no demand at such high prices a fixed supply has no effect.
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:44:04
People say how high are fees for sending money with banks etc. but they pay 7% fees on Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-12-08 13:48:10
good strategy to make people aware of what is Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:21:16
I think that stating that Bitcoin will reach the million dollar mark only because it is scarce isn't rational. There are too many variables in game. What for example if mining gets so expensive that the mining farms all over the world have to close? If there is a stock crash, highly probable in the next year, then will the people really invest in Bitcoin? Look at the crash at the end of 2018 Bitcoin was at 3k... Bitcoin has to come down to 1k dollar or even lower that people recognize a strong buy opportunity and then the price can shoot up to 100x.
Maybe we are in a bubble that started at the beginning of 2017 and we will fall back to that level, who knows.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:26:39
Possible, not so many buys and a lot of selling pressure. I am out of crypto since a few weeks and I think I am not the only one leaving this crypto world of Bitcoin and altcoins

If you bought at the top then actually Bitcoin took your money
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:57:03
I think BTC will crash alongside the stock market, look at the end of 2018. Stock market crashed heavily and BTC reached 3k level

Please guys, for those prices to happen the willingness to pay of the people should also be that high. If people do not want to pay for 0.1 btc 10k dollars then price will not grow as depicted in the picture.
Don’t take that hypotethical price action as 100 % sure. Be open also for an unexpected bear market towards 1k dollar, where it all started in 2017. 
Everything is possible, but don’t say it will hit 100k for sure.
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:13:22
A lot of tech stocks made better than Bitcoin in the last 5 years. For example Amd x40
@_date: 2019-12-11 20:42:42
There are already scarce Bitcoin, think of all the millions of coins that got lost. This is a far bigger factor in triggering a price boom then a cut in supply I think.
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:48:57
I don’t post ignorance, you are the one not accepting critics or others opinions. I bet people that have made millions with Bitcoin or crypto are not here defending Bitcoin’s image like you are doing now. They are enjoying their profits in some nice places. 
Bitcoin will never reach it’s ATH from 2017, write jt down, it was a bubble, accept it and don’t stress much about Bitcoin. Get out of crypto now or you will regret it, how maybe you regret having sold your Bitcoins before 2017.
@_date: 2019-12-12 12:43:51
Bitcoin enthusiasts compare Bitcoin with whatever they want to compare only when it’s on their side, when somebody says something negative about it then he gets attacked. For example I cannot post some theory about how Bitcoin will fall back to 1k dollars that immediately I get insulted. 
Brainwashed people.
