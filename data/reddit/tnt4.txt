They probably exhausted all of their fiat on Bitstamp.
Coinbase is NOT an exchange. They buy BTC on Bitstamp on your behalf.

Which means that a lot of longs are going to get squeezed when/if a whale dumps, bringing the price even lower.

When will these fucking idiots realize that you can't ban P2P protocols?
It's almost as stupid as the illegal numbers debate.

It is as retarded as requiring people who produce SHA256 hashes to pay taxes. Which is exactly what mining is. Oh wait...

Please stop quoting that damn site.
Chinese exchanges have very low or zero fees and there's some evidence that they are faking their trading volume. With zero fees I could buy and sell 10k BTC to myself over and over and fiatleak would report a gazillion BTC being "bought".

They have and they will. Apple is one of the most trusted brands in the world right now. Maybe not to the libertarian/anarchist bitcoiner but to the average joe six pack. Add to that the fact that they are the most well capitalized entity that exists, with practically 0 debt and $150B in reserves.

Indeed. Why would Mark ever send dust of 0.031337?

There is a 3k bid wall being moved upwards.

Blockchain.info - the website - is not the same thing as the Bitcoin Blockchain.

So in essence: "It's not my fault, it was a bug in the bitcoin software algorithm"

Blockchain: a data structure stored on your hard drive if you run a full Bitcoin client
Blockchain.info: a website owned and operated by a Hong Kong for-profit company

No, Coinbase is not an exchange. They are a broker, they buy bitcoin on real exchanges on your behalf (and make quite a bit of profit doing so).

That's exactly what the users of MtGox said. I don't need to tell you what happened to them, right?
With that said, blockchain.info is more secure than an exchange since they don't (if everything is going as it should) have access to your private keys.

Why? Are they soiled?

BTC just wants to blaze it.

Because the market is a cold hearted bitch with a 12 inch strap on.
