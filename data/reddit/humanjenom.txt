I WANT Coinbase to make money.  I put in a suggestion to give customers first dibs on IPO shares.
I respect the CEO, he took ownership and made some ambitious statements.
Wells-Fargo stole the identity of over 3.5 million customers.  The bar was set pretty low.
Hell, Coinbase could steal the identity of 1.75 million customers and would STILL be 100% better than Wells-Fargo.

That is an absurd comment.  
Transparency is the currency of the Information Age.  BitCoin is merely synchronizing perception and reality.
It wasn't BitCoin that committed over 3.5 million counts of Identity Theft, it was Wells Fargo.  The FBI did nothing, DHS did not even bat an eye.
It wasn't BitCoin that created the Great Recession.  It was the major banks.  The FBI did nothing.  DHS didn't skip a beat.
The financial system is Transforming, NOT collapsing.  There will be losers but those who get it will be winners.

You know what? I WANT Coinbase to make money.  I heard the CEO's response and he owned it, and wants Coinbase to be the most trusted.  
Blockchain gives us the ability to measure their progress.

Precisely.  When Jehova's Witnesses come to my house I don't tell them they can't say what they are saying, I tell them to get off my property.  That is not censorship that is me ruling over my kingdom, such as it is.  
I believe freedom of speech is an absolute right, but forcing others to listen to it is not.  
I applaud Coinbase for aspiring to higher standards.

I applaud Coinbase for their move.  Coinbase is not responsible for Gab's survival.
Gab must build its own value proposition!

I have no issue with censoring hate speech, religion, or other stupidity.  Freedom of speech is absolute, but so is my right to kick your ass out on the street if you come into my home and start freedom-of-speeching religion or stupid shit.
Coinbase is not censoring these asshats, Coinbase just doesn't want them in their house.  When Jehova's witnesses come to my house I answer the door naked, say no thanks, and slam the door in their face.  Is that censorship?
To me it is not.  They can say whatever the fuck they want, but I don't have to listen to it.

Be patient.  If you thought it was a good buy at 15K then you gotta love it at 7K.
Personally, I hope it drops to 3K so I can buy even more.
At one time there were over 200 car companies in the U.S.  Everyone wanted to be like Henry.
After the dust settled there were 3, but Ford made through and is still around today.
Sounds very similar to what is happening in crypto today.  Unless you're retiring or are in dire need of money today there's probably little reason to sell.

Yes, and coins have been around since at least the days of the Romans.  Furthermore, one type of currency does not replace another, new currencies are simply added to the mix.
Even today people still barter and trade and BitCoin will not replace paper and coin, BitCoin is simply a technologically advanced currency that capitalizes on the nature of the Internet.

No sir, I believe it is you who are clueless about investment banks.  Those investors with money will soon be clamoring for more transparency, both from the investment banks that pool investor's money and the companies that those funds are invested in.  The BlockChain which is the foundation of BitCoin is the perfect tool for that.  
I think you will see a big paradigm shift especially after the fraud that was perpetrated by Wells Fargo and other Major Banks both in their consumer operations as well as investment operations.
As an investor I want to be able to sleep at night knowing that my funds are invested in legitimate enterprises.

Well what can I tell you?  Even investment banks need janitors and people to take out the trash.
I'll tell you what, I'll bet you 1 BitCoin that 10 years from now BitCoin and Blockchain will have transformed investment banking.  
Its a little early to say how or what but that I am sure of.  To me BitCoin today is to investing and banking what the Model T was to cars.  I'll put my BitCoin where my mouth is.

That is not a theory, that is FACT!!! Transparency is not a friend of Jamie Dimon or ANY of the major banks.  LOL.  
Most people don't realize that it was money from drug cartels that provided the liquidity for banks in the initial stages of the Great Recession.  LMAO.
I would love to see someone take all the bank transactions from 2002 'till now and put them in a blockchain for analysis.  Forget prison, Jamie Dimon would be drawn and quartered by the mob of people he robbed.
In America you don't rob banks, banks rob YOU!!!

Lol you could not be more wrong.  It is transforming as we speak.  The fact that you and I are even discussing it is validation of that.

So you're an investment banker eh?  What does the following do for your investments?
China is more afraid of BitCoin than of the United States.  
Ask Mr. Dimon this question.  If BitCoin is "nothing" why does the second largest economy need laws to manage "nothing".  Who is the bigger fool?  China or Jamie Dimon?
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:49:02
The question of whether it's investment or consumer is irrelevant.  Institutionalized fraud permeates an entire organization.  
Wells Fargo had a thin legitimate consumer veil.  But behind the scenes it was driven by executive decisions.
Their fraud may well have impacted everyone with with a retirement plan.  Every quarter companies have earnings calls with Wall Street analysts and shareholders.  They reported the earnings and account growth based on opening  false accounts by identity theft.  This went on from 2002 - 2012.
BitCoin puts the power of a bank in your hands.  Global Internet commerce requires a digital currency.  Right now that's BitCoin.  Let the entrepreneurs take it from there.

America has just lost capitalism to China, a communist country.  How does that affect your investments?  
China isn't at "war" with crypto. They're trying to make it work for them.

There's nothing wrong with centralized authorities as long as  they manage the system with integrity.  When you have organizations like JP Morgan and Wells Fargo who defraud their own customers and the central authority does nothing people will act to protect their own assets out of simple self interest.  Whether that means investing in gold, stuffing cash in mattresses, or something more elegant like BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:38:49
Well investment banks have a new currency to trade, the V twins tried to float a BitCoin ETF, and moving currency around the world for direct investment in emerging markets have never been easier, faster, or cheaper.
That's just for starters.

Shows what a moron Jamie Dimon is and how little he actually understands what currency is.
From a pure historical and theoretical standpoint digital crypto currency makes sense.
During the agrarian economy the currency was a reflection of that economic epoch.  People (not governments) used the products they raised or cultivated as currency.  Trading furs for food, food for tools, animals for supplies.  It was a barter economy based on items that reflected the agrarian epoch.
During the industrial economy the currency was a reflection of that economic epoch.  Currencies were printed and minted using technology of industry to produce paper and metal currencies.   Made sense because you can't really carry 1,000 chickens around in your wallet to buy that new Model-T Ford.  It was an industrial economy where the currency was product of the industrial epoch.
Durning the digital economy it only makes sense, therefore, to have a currency that reflects the digital epoch.  If not bitcoin, then some other digital currency is theorized to emerge in order to serve the needs of the digital economy.
Where Jamie Dimon's logic fails is where he doesn't even realize that bitcoin makes JP Morgan obsolete, and the factors that he uses to make an argument against bitcoin are the very reasons why bitcoin, or something like it, it necessary.
1. He says bitcoin is not backed by any government.  Of course not, nor should it be.  Just like the Internet that is ubiquitous and distributed and not controlled by any single government, you would theorize that a currency for the digital age would likewise be universal and not controlled by any single government.
2. His idiotic statement: "You can’t have a business where people can invent a currency out of thin air and think the people buying it are really smart. It’s worse than tulip bulbs, OK?"
What is the U.S. dollar if not printed out of thin air.  The U.S. Treasury just finished several years worth of creating money out thin air - they even have a fancy name for it "Quantitative Easing".  
What Dimon the dunce seems to ignore is that it is the two parties in a transaction that determine both the nature and the value of a currency.  If the two parties in a transaction are willing to accept digital currency then the value of the currency is established. 
3. Dimon the dunce also states "It’s a fraud, OK?".  The only currency that is a fraud is a currency that is created and manipulated by a central bank. Quite the opposite it is quite impossible to commit fraud with blockchain and bitcoin because a single actor such as a fraudulent bank like JP Morgan is not able to manipulate the system.
Perhaps Jamie Dimon, the dunce, is simply having trouble coming to terms with the immutable fact that BitCoin already has more customers globally than JP Morgan does, and that JP Morgan has lost their ability to defraud BitCoin customers the way JP Morgan defrauded their mortgage customers.

This 'honestly' doesn't mean a thing.
"Transparency is the currency of the digital age."
Coinbase can acquire anything they want.  If they lose trust, it is all worth zero.  
The media that carries this story as is, is worthless media.
