The symbol exists and your iPhone X can display it, ₿, it’s just not available on the emoji keyboard because it’s technically not an emoji. It’s more comparable to a symbol like the $£¥€ signs. 
I set up text replacement in my keyboard settings, whenever i type “bitbit” it replaces it with a ₿ symbol.

Has been for three months, great app.

Hey man, thanks for the advice. 
I have the required skills and Linux knowledge to set up a secure box but decided to go with the ease of use of a hardware wallet for now. I ordered my Ledger Nano S a few hours ago and should be here soon! ��
I might play around with repurposing and old computer in the nearby future but I think my Nano S should do the trick for now.

That’s not really the point. The point is that right now it’s not really a viable currency because of the high fees. We can only hope that LN comes in and changes that.

Well he’s not wrong... been waiting 9 days on a transaction just because my fee was too low.

I feel like a lot of people over at r/btc don't see BCash as something new but rather as the "real bitcoin". They keep referencing to Bitcoin as "Bitcoin Legacy" in attempts to replace BTC with their BCash.
It's a strange place though...

When experiencing these dips would it be more ideal to leave my bitcoins on Coinbase so that I can sell and buy more easily during the dips? Because I feel that transferring to a wallet and then transferring back to Coinbase, waiting and then selling (+transaction fee) takes forever. I know it's not that safe to leave my money on Coinbase though, so curious what some of you say.
Sorry for the newb questions haha.

Thanks man, will follow your advice, seems like hodl is the best way out there.
I'm using breadwallet on my iPhone to get started, does that do the job?

I've read up on a lot of the hardware wallets, they seem really interesting but like you say more for the heavily invested people. As of right now I don't have my life savings so I think it would be overkill. 
As for breadwallet I've kept my 12 word backup on paper at a safe place.
Thanks for the advice!

Would now be the time to buy some more while hodling on to my previous purchases?
Also, how do you guys prefer to buy in situations like this? Quickly buy with credit cards or do most of you leave some money on exchanges for situations like this?
I used a bank transfer last time because the fees were so low, only downside is that this is painstakingly slow and horrible for these delicious
