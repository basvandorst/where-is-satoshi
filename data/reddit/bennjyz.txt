I don't think this is accurate. Bitcoin is not standard crypto at all. It violates many prior assumptions in the field. The cost to break bitcoin is not the same as ECC. It is not impossible to break it, but reasonably safe under certain assumptions. One could call this Byzantine cryptography. The reason Bitcoin doesn't break is that there is consensus and interest in keeping the system alive. In this context the invention is the agreed notion of compute cycles called difficulty and the abstract concept of time called block cycles. These notions are completely incompatible with cryptography as it existed in 2008. It is no surprise that only few cryptographers take serious interest.
Mining was never invented - "mining" is not a word that appeared in the original whitepaper. The Bitcoin design was that everyone can contribute CPU power. Compute power doesn't add to the security at all. It is just that no one can create CPU power out of nothing, and has to burn valuable electricity. Hence it is possible to signal over a communications channel an economic choice. Those choices might not be optimal, but ideally all users would vote with their CPU power. This was Bitcoin, before people talked about mining. Once one understands that, one can much better appreciate alternative designs. The much simpler way to do it would have been IP addresses. Quote from the paper (my highlighting):
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. **Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote.**"
