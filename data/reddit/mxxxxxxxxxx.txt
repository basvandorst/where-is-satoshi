Hashrate does follow price. But not very strict.
A rising price will always lead to a rise in hashrate because people will start mining operations.
At a stable price hashrate will also grow because of  technological improvements
At a falling price hashrate will only decline if enough  miners cannot cover their opex.
but very important: price does not follow hashrate!
Price is determined by supply and demand. The supply is independent from hashrate ( because of the difficulty adjustment). The demand is also independent from hashrate. Conclusion : price does not follow hashrate!

Good point. in fiat economy the government could just print money and give it to the poor without having it to take from someone.
In a pure bitcoin economy the government would have to take the coins from someone if they want to give them to someone else.
So the "money to the people" argument works both ways. Interesting. I didn't see it that way before. Thanks for sharing your thoughts

I believe also  that failing currencies *should* cause major adoption in the affected countries. However, it is not happening  at significant scale. Which business is actually paying its employees in crypto in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Argentina or Turkey? Why is it not happening?
Why are the posts of businesses accepting crypto dominated by other countries?
Somehow its frustrating and I start seeing it as a bearish sign that adoption is not coming, even if fiat fails completely in a country!!

Actually, why not :
Step 1: start state mining at a massive scale and accumulate some coins
Step 2: start negotiating contracts based on bitcoin  with countries that have trouble with their currency like Turkey, Iran and Venezuela
Step 3:  declare bitcoin legal tender in Russia to pump the price
If I were in his position I'd go for it

Good post.. It will finally stop the argument : maybe we are down 65% from ATH,but yoy btc performs better than any stock.
Somehow I felt nobody who got in in Dec17 liked this argument anyway.
And yes... Currently it looks very unlikely (though not impossible) that  we will Crack the ATH in 2018. That's a fact.

Looks like some petahash are going to disappear from the network until they find a new owner.
@_date: 2018-09-25 06:35:02
I fully agree with you. So the question for me is, how this is going to change.  Are people willing at some point to share their precious coins with their employees and we will see adoption? Or will cryptos only purpose be hodling?

For me it's hard to believe that *any* govt  is buying currently. I am quite sure that it's difficult to get a budget approval for speculating with digital currencies

Assami aleykum,
Its a Good idea if you have free electricity and access to free capital.
Just do the math and run a small calculation : what's your total investment in mining equipment? What's your operating cost? How long does it take until it pays off at current hashrate and price?.. I ended up at the conclusion that I would not even be able to pay  off the mining equipment whitin 10 years if the hash rate keeps on growing that fast... But you should run ur own model!
If you are super bullish, buying the coins at a premium might still be cheaper and easier compared to seeing up a mining operation.

My point is that my crypto believe system is at stake because of this experience. I care about censorship resistance, sound money etc.

You should consider the seed compromised.
NOT TO DO : 
If a microphone that is connected to the internet, don't say the seed loud. ( E.g. Alexa, Siri, your smart TV, your phone)
If a cam is nearby make sure it doesn't spot the seed at any time 
If you are at an open space don't expose the seed to the sky. A drone or Satellite could be watching.
TO DO
1. Get somewhere safe
2.Create a seed
3. Write it down 2x on different sheets 
4. Enter it in your hardware wallet 
5. Cover the sheets
6. Hide the seed in 2 different places

If you believe in bitcoin invest regularly a fixed amount of money. Just don't look at the price trying to time the market. Timing the market WILL NOT WORK. Trying to time the market, you will end up checking the price 10x a day and become an addict.

I don't get one thing: 
why is the tech  called ASIC boost? It sounds like it could not be used by GPU mining. 
If i understand correctly its a trick in SHA256 that allows you to compute the hashes faster if you keep the tail 64B fix and roll the nversion that is located in the  head 64 B
So.. Can ASIC boost be used at GPU or CPU  mining as well?

I 100% agree to your statement that the bitcoin production price ( aka difficulty) is high because of Bitcoins price.
However, I strongly disagree that a low price limits the Supply of bitcoin because  miners are "unlikely" to sell.
The decision of a miner to sell a coin  or to hodl is not different than the decision from any other coin hodler. If he is hodling because he is expecting the price to increase that's speculative demand.
If the production cost of the miner is higher than the market price it means that it  would be better for him to buy bitcoin and stop mining.

Bitcoin is not valuable because of its production cost. Nothing is valuable be cause of its production cost.
The value of any good depends only on supply and demand.
In case of bitcoin the new supply is fixed in the protocol ( statistically one block per 10 Minutes). And the supply is NOT depending on the amount of energy spent.
The demand of bitcoin is therefore the only  remaining source for bitcoin valuation. And the demand is currently 99% speculation based and absolutely independent from the energy spent in mining!
Energy consumption does not influence the bitcoin price.

You are very right!
Short term price predictions are total bullshit.
Long term predictions should have a model behind and are more of acadamic interest than useful for a buy/ sell decision due to their huge uncertainty.
My favorite models: 
- Comparison with total available physical gold 
- technology adoption curves / S-curves
- comparison with international remittance market 
- comparison With total available physical money

Just to *keep* the current price level buyers are purchasing 1800 BTC per day from the miners for roughly 6.8 million USD.
