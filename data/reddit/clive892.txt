Please don't take this as a slight, but investing *all* your money in Bitcoin as a young adult is an incredibly bad idea. As any investor will tell you, always diversify so that your risks are spread.

An addendum is as well as inspecting the source, you'd have to compile it. Relying on pre-compiled binaries is like being sold a lion when the picture showed a housecat.

A three word passphrase would take 1000^3 (1000000000) attempts. I think your calculation would be the amount of combinations if you used all the words in the 1000 word list once in a random sequence. This would be an awesome passphrase!

I used to wonder the same. Why all this talk about passphrases, just bruteforce the dictionary. Let me show you why.
An extended password set: (Using upcase, lowercase, symbols number etc) is 96 different characters (using 
So a four letter password like "44%a" has a password complexity of 96^4 = 84934656 or 8.5 x 10^7
The [Oxford English dictionary]( has 600,000 words. Many of these are archiac/derivatives/unusable, so let's round it down to 100,000.
A four word passphrase such as: lunatic stiles embargo strength
has a password complexity of 100,000^4 = 100000000000000000000 or 10^20.
Soon as you stop thinking of the words as words, but highly unique symbols, their strength as passphrases becomes more comprehensible.
