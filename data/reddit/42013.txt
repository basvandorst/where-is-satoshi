Utility = useful
 I would say it's very useful.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:20:04
You're right OP.
@_date: 2015-03-06 04:26:06
Try hitting the lock image, then enter your passcode.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:36:13
100% disagree with everything you said.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:05:16
Was the original drive running Ubuntu, or just have the wallet on it?
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:58:43
Xmr.to allows you to use it to make anonymous bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:43:33
Monero...truly anonymous transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-07 17:51:09


Downvoted for caring so much about downvotes
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:12:04
So I assume you have you tried booting that drive directly from your other system then?
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:21:09
If anything, less people know what a browser is now.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:21:09
Quit asap.

@_date: 2015-03-03 19:44:20
You must be confused. We are talking about plural form of bitcoin the currency, bitcoin vs bitcoins.
"How many bitcoins does that cost?" or "How do you store your bitcoins?" is incorrect.
"How much bitcoin does that cost?" or "How do you store your bitcoin?" is correct. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:26:37


Take horrendous ideas elsewhere please.
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:07:53
That's what I'm waiting for. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 01:32:29


@_date: 2015-03-10 23:54:21
Wait for bitcoins final form and you won't even realize you paid. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:14:04
The problem is the circle jerk and blind alt hate just because people here only want "their" coin (bitcoin) to increase in value, but become hypocrites when it's "their" altcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:38:36


This is why I refrained from mentioning the freeze technique. I also didn't know it was considered old/dated or not. If you have serious value there definitely get professional help first before using these last ditch techniques.. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:55:54
There was a pump and dump. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:45:42
This thread is proof 99% of this sub is only in bitcoin as a chance to get rich. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:45:06
You can use it to send an anonymous btc payment with xmr.to and also transfer value to anyone anonymously.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:47:49
Any other system you can test using the main connection?
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:38:18
No, I'm referring to your use of "bitcoin" vs "bitcoins" for plural. OP is correct in his thread title. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:21:46
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:52:17
2FA doesn't do much to prevent phishing. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:13:07
Buy Monero and use xmr.to to make a payment. Done.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:57:08
It will be both. Article was downvote worthy though.
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:36:37
Yes they are. They can be set up offline. 
"Cold Storage: You can have secure offline wallets and still safely spend from an online computer."
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:13:15


@_date: 2015-02-19 08:11:37
They aren't lost. Just lost control of.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:30:11
That's pretty secure. Make sure to boot from a live CD and I'd unplug your hard drives during the process as well.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:41:44


You must be one of the users the article talks about.
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:51:43
No shit. And quit shilling for btc-e.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:02:51
It's easier for the average consumer to get their Coinbase account phished than to lose something physical.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:56:28
Monero is the best anonymous cryptocurrency right now actually and is not premined like Darkcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:23:01
Armory or Electrum. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:45:45
Why didn't you explain a backup seed to her?
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:05:05
That news site desperate for that non existent 780btc reward
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:57:24
Because scamthereum shills like you are annoying.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:06:21
There's a password option and a PIN.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:05:28
There's a password and PIN feature. This is pointless and childish. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:30:44
You don't know what the definition of the internet is if you think you can use Facebook without it. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:52:57
It's truly the best alt out there and actually achieves something bitcoin can't yet. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:37:51
Armory and Electrum get my vote for best offline wallets. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:27:03
Wow, Ledger Blue sounds amazing!
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:01:29
*they're x2
@_date: 2015-02-15 06:01:54
Buy litecoin and sell it back when it doubles in btc value.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:51:01
There already exists "superior" cryptocurrency. That should help answer your question.
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:17:37
Shit title, also didn't read.
@_date: 2015-02-22 09:37:14
A wallet that can be set up on an offline computer. 
"Cold Storage: You can have secure offline wallets and still safely spend from an online computer."
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:15:19
@_date: 2015-02-13 02:38:38


Yes... Lmao. You can't Facebook without internet. There is no partial internet. Learn what internet is.
Confirmed  you are part of the "millions" in this article. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:42:21
Sticking feathers up your butt does not make you a chicken. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:50:24
Even mentioning Ripple or Stellar exclusively is giving them way too much credit.
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:36:04
Think you missed the part about "offline signing". A virus can't do shit if you do this properly.
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:41:13
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:27:33
This sub is shit.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:56:33
You'll be lucky if reddit is around in 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:33:45
"Build a fucking wall!"
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:37:35
It's not.
@_date: 2015-02-15 23:03:51
Believe it or not, not everyone is a dishonest scumbag.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:08:52
Doesn't change a thing. That's irrelevant information. It still stands that  ~233000 addresses control ~97% of bitcoins.
