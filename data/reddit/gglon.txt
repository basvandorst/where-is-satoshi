Actually supply is controlled  by the protocol which miners are incentivized to change to increase their earnings. But more importantly halving stoppage would result in more secure network and as a result allow for bigger blocksize increase, cheaper txs with less impact on decentralization.

No, that is unfortunately not possible since there is no telling if not used bitcoins are lost of just in cold storage. The only indication are people who reported their lost. One can predict though, that with the increase of bitcoin value, the annual percentage of lost coins will be approaching some constant comparable with that of fiat money. For comparison FED is printing about 1% annually^[1]( ^[2]( and most of this is probably replication of destroyed, not lost notes. While amount of lost gold bars annually is probably much lower since most of them are sitting 'safely' in bank vaults.

Can't a compromise be at the same time consensus? 
Lets assume that there is a developer's consensus on a particular solution. But in order to implement it they need to convince users that such a solution is worth implementing. As developers do have an authority in purely technological areas much less so in more conceptual/economical ones. How do you propose to achieve consensus among users in such cases?

That would be very wise thing to do. That is why we need a system in which every actor acting in their self interest (short and long term) acts in the interests of the whole system. In case of bitcoin miners  are most interested in the long term prosperity since they are proven to be invested in a hardware that would lose value when bitcoin valuation decreases. That is why they are expected to cooperate.


What is the system of making fundamental development decisions that would be best for bitcoin network? Which system would be most valued by users?

@_date: 2017-02-03 01:16:48
Thank you for your detailed and thoughtful answer. 


I don't understand such criteria, since safety is ultimately proportional to the expected cost of an attack. 
Eg safety of a transaction after [x] confirmations in time t (in case of bitcoin's pure POW) depends on cost c of bribing some part of network for time t. Cost c of the bribe depends on many variables but the most important is total mining revenue. And total mining revenue depends on bitcoin valuation, block reward and amount of transaction fees. 
Therefore increase of total mining revenue increases safety of transaction. And increase of total mining revenue is in very best interests of miners.

That is exactly why some people fear that fees will dwindle. Since in the short term optimal strategy for miner will be (once Gavin's O(1) optimization is implemented) to include virtually all of the transactions that has even very small fee included. If the miners follow that strategy, there will be no incentive to pay high fees. The miners' revenue would dwindle and the only one left mining would be charity which may not be enough to secure the network.


Indeed. But one should consider what "technically possible" actually means. In case of Bitcoin it means that enough fees must be paid to secure the network.

Analogy with airline company can indeed be very good. If the plane is large, ticket's price must be low to fill it. While if the plane is small, small number of tickets is sold. Maximal revenue is therefore obtained for optimally sized plane.
In case of Bitcoin one of the arguments is to limit the blocksize in order to make space in block artificially scarce and drive transaction fees up. Some people fear that without such limitation, transaction fees will become smaller and smaller, making miners revenue smaller and smaller destroying Bitcoin security model (free rider problem). Gavin thinks that people will find a way to honestly pay miners or miners will find a way to demand honest fees. There are many possibilities eg. creating mining cartel that won't mine on top of blocks with too low fees.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:00:08
You, like Gavin, would not like to speculate on far future. But there are people who would like to do just that. And since the future is unknown, it is difficult to argue with them. So I think that now you understand the problem.
Every solution for financing the network in the future has some pros and cons. It may aloso actually prove that with unlimited blocks the best method is just to remove mining reward halving. That is why blocksize may be connected with future max bitcoin amount.

At first glance it doesn't seem to be possible as the following criteria in PoW must be met:
1. Difficulty to do obtain right result
2. Easily verifiable result
3. Ambiguous data as the input in order to secure transactions.
The idea to do that with CAPTCHA:
- each miner chooses random set of letters of random font
- each miner obfuscate the letters with algorithm that depends on transactions and publish result
- all miners are trying to guess each other letters.
- if someone guesses &gt;50% letters and &gt;50% miners accept the work, then the block is mined.
The problems are: 
- miners can't verify their job, so they constantly publish their results hoping it will be &gt;50% - lots of wasted bandwidth
- the amount of letters would be prohibitively large in order for some person to do the work in reasonable time.

In short they want to regulate it in order to make it more successful - *seems logic*. They seem not to understand that the very reason bitcoin was created was the fact that their regulations make it very expensive to transfer value. And that cost of those regulations is by no means proportional to the benefits.  
They seem not to realize that bitcoin is hugely successful in the US  *despite* the inability to exchange btc for usd. Their current regulations hold back bitcoin growth so that we still need to wait for reputable escrow services, ripple or hardware wallets that would resolve much of the current issues. 
Also I don't understand the tax problem. e.g. every shop may be required to immediately report any sales so that it would be easily verifiable by any controller if the sales are in fact reported. Much safer solution that cash registers alone. And not long ago in the country I happen to live, despite the fact that most tranactions were done by cash, I have not heard about any serius sales tax evasion issues.

I'm afraid it's too complicated and technical for me, but I will write how I understand it. Correct me if I'm wrong.
Imagine group of miners that have 50TH and group of bitcoin users who want to transfer money in the network of 10TH. Users create transactions with fees 1mBTC each, and target of 10TH. While some of the miners form the group that have 10TH and they want 1BTC for one block of transactions. So they wait till 1000 users create transactions with 1mBTC fee each, gather them and create block. Next, they mine this block with 10TH and... it's done. If miners are kind enough, they can also include tx with 0 fees and lower target in the same block. Also users can change their fee at any moment before tx was included in a block. There would be a lot of parallel groups and the market would decide how much you need to pay for given amount of TH.
Hope it make sense.

Most miners  are bitcon users themselves and all of them wants bitcoin to succeed so I don't think any major pool would be able to use such policy (replacing during first block).

The miners will mine in the network, that is most profitable, which means has the value of Bitcoin reward/Hashpower the highest. BTC will not cost much in the minor fork, so everyone interest is to mine in major one. The best case is when major fork has 100%. Especially if the fork was an accident, it should be completely annihilated to get back to 100%. Otherwise bitcoin credibility would be lowered, and again BTC value would diminish. And the only way to get back to 100% was to get miners back to 0.7.


Then transaction fees would be major income, not block reward. Besides, as I said, their block reward wouldn't be that high because their network will be small/unusable and the price of theirs BTC would plummet. 


A country can build its own fork, which would be just like different currency. But BTC architecture is p2p so everyone can choose it's own fork. And if the country ban all forks but one, then why bother and not ban whole Bitcoin.

Very often one can hear that unless an asset is sold there is no profit. But in fact selling an asset is just exchanging it for another one which is just more liquid. Therefore in order to determine how much an asset is really worth at the time, one must take into consideration both: value and liquidity. Where value is defined as the purchase power while liquidity is inversely proportional to the time one must wait to exchange their assets for required goods.

While I agree that weighting an investment against the value of invested stable currency is sound short term, I still can't see why you need to convert to it in order to claim profit. One can define profit as personal profit when your property is worth more to you. And it is worth more if it's either easier to exchange or exchangeable for greater amount of desired goods. Where the easiest to exchange is the good itself, and it's value is subjective matter.
One can also define profit in other, more universal ways, but limiting it to the amount of real currency one possess seems unjustified to me.

Since it just started, I don't sell. I will in the price range $30-$40 if the pace doesn't change.

While small tx will go off chain, those requiring higher security will remain. The higher adoption the higher the security threshold so the fees could be larger. While the larger blocksize decreases this threshold making fees lower. Given the adoption one can find blocksize that maximizes miners profit. If the adoption is big enough then miners profit can be big enough to secure the system. Though if the blocksize will be too big then the centralization will hit the miners.
For example given reasonable in the future 100MB blocksize with enough adoption to make avg fee $1 miners would make ~0.4mln $ per block. So the system would be both more secure and given faster connections more decentralized than it is today.

So maybe (assuming they will deliver) they want to close as many orders as possible before people realizes that the profits will not be that big.

This video is highly inaccurate. The blocksize limit in bitcoin serves the same role as fixed fee in ppcoin. In both cases higher adoption would mean higher transaction fees and no micro tx if the blocksize wouldn't increase and fee wouldn't decrease. But as it is said miners are not stupid and they will choose 3. option - eventually increasing max blocksize, because that would bring them the biggest profit. And yes, its miners who have the biggest influence. So if say &gt; 90% miners and &gt;50% full nodes will agree to larger limit it will be increased. The situation is similar in ppcoin, though here stake holders also are important so it will probably be slightly more difficult to have required consensus.
I think there is a room for both PoW an PoS and they will complement each other.

As Bitcoin is a network that is intended to provide full security, in the future it will be able to serve only big transactions with high fees. The remedy is not increasing block size limit since it would centralize network and make it less secure.

Bitcoin alone was and will never be the ultimate payment system.

It is true that Silk Road ≠ some file sharing site. But it may also be true that Silk Road == some new Megaupload or 10 file sharing sites. Than it is like we have one more SR, and the threat increases.
 Though I agree with you, that the increase would be very low, it still requires some consideration.

It would be hard to tell what involve SR :). My answer: no (as a currency, excluding SatoshiDice of course). Transaction volume in USD is rising though -[blockchain.info](

If the bitcoin would replace all derivatives in the world, then some of them would be colored. But on average yes, it is possible.

That is true that windows doesn't have trusted repository yet (I've heard that was about to change with windows 8). But if you are savvy enough to use bitcoin and linux, usually you don't a problem with verifying 3rd party credibility. What is more, on linux and iOS you may have a misleading conviction that you are perfectly safe regardless of what you are doing. The only thing that saves linux users is lack of them. Though if bitcoin users will start using linux, I think it will no longer be an issue.
Plus: google windows 7 live usb.
Plus 2: The same goes for iOS and all other non OpenSource stuff.

1. As for me I can't think of something better than Bitcoin now. So I don't think any better currency will outperform it in like 50 years. But in the world that changes so fast it is possible. 
As we all know Bitcoin has [weaknesses]( and most of them can be fixed with the change of protocol. This however, might lead to many forks which can hardly resemble the old Bitcoin. 
2. Basically Bitcoin can be attacked either by a brute force or legal action followed by a brute force. Is it possible to make Bitcoin illegal? With the imagination of US lawyers I have no doubt it is. You can just take under supervision/outlaw independent encryption and you are good. Then order some ASICs (eg from intel(r)) and bah, end of Bitcoin. When it will be stronger though, it would be much more difficult.

["In some countries, even the domestic use of cryptography is, or has been, restricted."]( 
Restriction wouldn't mean you can't encrypt eg your https transmission with gmail. It only means that your usage is restricted to the several cases the US allowed. And banning is one thing, while law enforcement is another. With all the VPNs successful firewall seems impossible.  
For at least 1 year 51% will be relatively cheap, so I wouldn't call it unlikely.
Forking by definition means that not everyone agrees to the changes and the network splits. If only small percentage doesn't agree to the changes, they probably would rather migrate nonetheless. But with more controversial stuff, it would not be the case.

It is not necessarily true in case of bitcoin since it can be treated as virtual gold. Gold has relatively very few users and its value is mostly speculative. The same goes for bitcoin.
