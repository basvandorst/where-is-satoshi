Here you go. Thought I'd publish it on this thread in case anyone else needs it.
You need to go to File and make a copy so you can save it on your own Google Drive and edit it.
I have tried to make this as foolproof as possible:
 1. Included are a couple of example transactions
 2. I have added notes to each table header as some guidance
I would make the first transaction you current holding e.g 3.2 bitcoins at a cost of £1,000. Then simply start adding transactions as they happen.
Any questions, or changes needed/requested just PM me.

I know you have said you don't want to use a spreadsheet but have you considered Google Docs? The advantage (over Excel) is that you can pull in the current exchange rate live from Google Finance automatically using the following code:
I have a Doc with two sheets:
1 sheet lists all my BC transactons (buying and selling) so you can keep track of how much I am spending and profit/loss per transaction.
Then a second sheet provides me with an overall summary showing overall profit/loss pulling in the live GBP/BTC (I'm from the UK) exchange rate).
It's not much effort to update unless you're doing a crazy amount of transactions each day.
If you need help setting it up, just shout and I'll pull something together for you.
EDIT: I use two worksheets because the summary contains other investments I have but no reason why you couldn't do it all on one sheet
