My credit card emailed me and said they waived the foreign fee cause that’s one of the benefits on my card, no foreign transaction fee. I was a bit perplexed at first but makes sense now that I’m seeing your post.

Consider thinking about it from a % growth perspective, rather than what fraction of a btc you’ll be buying. When you buy stocks it’s the same thing, it’s about % growth, not $ growth.
