I'm not exactly sure what you mean here.  What I'm saying is that even though the GDP of the entire world is $70 trillion, that is not to say that there is $70 trillion of currency in circulation.  So why would we assume, if Bitcoin captured 1% of global commerce, that it's value should equal 1% of Global GDP?

I've seen similar arguments over and over again.  Why do people think that the value of a currency should correlate equally to the economy in which it operates?  
USD / GDP in the USA is ~6.81%, not 100%.  You have to consider the velocity of money.  A single dollar bill is transferred over and over in a single year.  If Bitcoin becomes commonplace people will be spending them more than once per year.  Model your information above to 6.81% and you can value Bitcoin (assuming 1% of global economy, which is absurdly high) at $432.03.

If you're holding Bitcoins, how is that using it as a currency?  Shouldn't you be spending Bitcoins in order to make it a currency?

I don't think the velocity of gold is relevant.  It is not used as a currency, but as a commodity.  Bitcoin is being bought and sold as a commodity, but it aims to be a currency.  It's really tough for me to think objectively about the value of a Bitcoin except in relation to the market of goods and services being exchanged.  
As that market grows faster than the supply of Bitcoins; Supply and Demand would say that the value of a Bitcoin will go up.  Conversely, as the price of Bitcoins stabilizes it becomes increasingly likely that speculators will move into different, higher yield investments.  That will put more Bitcoins into the market for use as a currency and should hold the value of a Bitcoin down.
A healthy velocity for Bitcoin is impossible for me to say.  Market pressures will resolve that for us.  I think it's safe to say that a faster Bitcoin velocity will help stabilize the value and entice more vendors to accept or even seek transactions in Bitcoin.  
As a small business owner, my net profit would increase by ~20% if I could eliminate all credit card swipe fees by switching to Bitcoins.  That is an astronomical incentive for any Business Owner, particularly in Retail where nearly everything is paid for via CC.

Exactly! It would be proportional depending on how fast Bitcoin is turned over.  But in either case, its not going to be 1:1 with the total size of the Bitcoin marketplace, which is what the OP's math assumes.
