Try Paxful. They have several payment options available. They use an escrow too.

You may try to go to Paxful and coordinate with a Customer Support. I believe Paxful is looking for this feature.

Try to check Paxful. I think they have the option where you can sell it for stock. I can't remember if that's exactly what I understood from a friend.

don't invest that much. Invest only small amount in batches and spread it to at least 2 to 3 different wallets. For example. You invest $3 btc in Paxful then another $3 to similar sites. Hope this helps.

I consider bitcoins as a gold because it has a value when you exchange it to a currency. I am still investing my bitcoins thru my Paxful wallet what I will call MY GOLD soon. I'm am waiting for the right time to harvest it.

I don't suggest buying or selling that high amount of bitcoins as it is risky. Your bank acct might freeze and you'll face interrogation with your bank. I suggest trading small amount by batches like what I am doing with my Paxful account.

That's risky. They might freeze your account. I don't trade that much with my Paxful wallet. I don't want to get into trouble.

As far as I know they started recognizing it. Some restaurants and shops are accepting bitcoins when I went there 2 to 3 months ago. I spent my shopping thru my Paxful bitcoin wallet and I had no issues.
