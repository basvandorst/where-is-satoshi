My 4 reasons:

2) Lightning  
3) ETF  
4) Spread of the crypto virus

Blockchain is here to decentralize power, blockchains for governments are a bad idea.

Bitcoin has a strong community, perhaps the strongest on the internet... Bitcoin works great and it is what it does.
You say PoW are getting 51% attacks more often, i've never experienced this on bitcoin... Perhaps Proof-of-stake is better for altcoins?
You are implicitly calling me "not intelligent", at the same time you shout fantics, fallacy and bashing. 
Not to mention you're on reddit for 5 days, anyway welcome and have a good one! ;)

Why are people with zero knowledge allowed to put artikels in the newspaper? Fake news is the enemy of our generation... Thousands of people read this artikel and will never understand the freedom and innovation bitcoin delivers right now.

Not so long ago the people of Europe had freedom. European institutions have to be reinvented or they will be taken down. They promised world peace, we got financial slavery instead. Go fuck yourself central bank!

If he would say a global recession is coming this week, it will happen this week. He has a lot of fanboys that do exactly as he says because they can't think for themselves

We need to stop this monetary slavery whatever the cost! We need to separate the government from the banks just like the separation between government and religion. Once we've accomplished this world peace is within reach :P
