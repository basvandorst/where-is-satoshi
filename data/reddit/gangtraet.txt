Some people who think the best solution to network congestion is a block size increase. Sure, it may still go down in flames due to centalization or otherwise. But pt it actually works as a currency. I am again buying stuff with crypto.

The Bitcoin Core wallet doesn’t even support it yet (in the gui interface).  
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:17:23
I’m an engineer. Most real world solutions are short term hacks.  
Edit: at least until the long term solution is ready. We build wider roads all the time.

A blocksize increase a year ago could have fixed this, at least until LN comes online. Now it is too late ...  :-(
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:21:37
Yes. Too late. And hard to support in wallets. Even Bitcoin Core does not support it in the GUI.

OK, so we are off by almost 50%.  Instead of handling 7 transactions per second, we can actually hande 10.  That *really* changes things.  Stop the presses!  Scrap the block size increase!

If you create the wallet in Armory, it does not rescan (then it knows that it is new).
@_date: 2015-06-22 10:13:35
So far the "downhill" due to this venture capital has been a version that is being tested now that synchronized in a fraction of the time needed by previous versions, and relies entirely on bitcoin core's block database instead of storing a second copy as well.  And it no longer requires 8GB of RAM.

Rewriting history?  Editing what the users actually wrote? Even if the purpose is noble, that does not sound like a good idea!

It is very easy.  You think you connect to the organizations web site, but I have hijacked the connection somewhere along the way (I work in your ISP, their ISP, or I just hacked one of the machines your connection jumps through).  When your browser request the page from the site, I edit it on the fly and replace their bitcoin address (and the QR code) with my bitcoin address.  You send money.  I get them.
Using a VPN/Tor does not help, except for the case where I work at your ISP.  But my evil twin works at the VPN's ISP, and will take the money instead.
The OP may be overly paranoid, but in principle he is right.

Too bad it requires iOS 8 or later.  Those of us with an old but trusty iPhone 4 (or even a 3GS - they are still around) are left out of the game.
A well, breadwallet is actually a good alternative.
@_date: 2014-12-07 11:44:02
They have had this problem several times with their iPhone and Android wallets, and have not really fixed it.  The wallet will give an error message if it cannot sync but still show the unsaved address.  Just asking for this kind of problems.
Their iPhone app also tends to make transactions that takes days to confirm.  Sometimes it just leaves out the miner's fee even though the wallet is set to include it.  Sometimes it creates transactions that their own website flags as non-standard.  They are all all eventually confirmed, but imagine doing an in-person transaction and then your transaction takes days to confirm.  The other guy is going to think you are trying to cheat him.
I have been using blockchain.info for a while, but have recently emptied my wallet and deleted the app.  There are too many issues, and I no feel confident using it.
Thanks to the OP for sharing his story.  I am shocked they have this bug, but no longer truly surprised.  :(
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:06:24
Only if they do it stupidly.  They can do this safely with wallet software managing cold storage, such as Armory.  Then you can generate the the transaction on an online computer with no access to the private keys, transfer the transaction to the cold storage computer, sign it there, transfer it back and broadcast it.  All without the cold storage computer ever touching a network.   Multisig can be used to make it even safer by having more than one offline computer that needs to be part of the signing process.
@_date: 2014-11-21 11:56:52
Yes, but that only works if the donor knows beforehand that you have a vanity address.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:45:46
No, it will be based on which side the miners take.  Once it is obvious which fork is winning, the miners will switch to that side, since choosing the other is highly risky: it would be gambling on sufficiently many other miners reacting the same way to keep a minority coin alive.
But essentially it will not even come to that.  The hardfork will only happen if at least 80% of the miners have switched to the newest client at the time of the fork.   So if 21% of the miners (counted by how many blocks they produce) are against the change, it will not happen. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:08:15
I highly doubt that Mark Kapeles would have been able to fake such a test during the last months of Mt. Gox.  So even if this is theoretically fakeable,  it is still useful.

In the math of the Mandelbrot set.
There is no math of the bitcoin price.  There is only psychology and economics, which may tend to repeat itself but does not guarantee it.  BTC is a strange asset, with several repeated bubbles.  It may have another, it may have seen the last one.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:41:18
They will most likely cancel all open orders ~~if~~ when they open again.  Anything else would be stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-03 21:16:55
Armory client. You keep you private keys on an offline computer, create the transactions on an online computer that only knows your public keys, transfer the unsigned transaction to the offline computer, signs it, return it to the online computer and broadcast.  A bit convoluted, but only takes a few minutes.  And very secure.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:30:30
And you cannot trade money if the customer holds one of the signatures in the multisig.  If the exchange holds them all, then they are ineffective.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:47:43
It would probably not be fatal, but I would recommend selling before it happens - it would be a major confidence crises.  However, the fork only happens if 80% of the miners have already switched to 0.11, why would they do that if they don't want the new version.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:41:27
But leaving out the meme would have helped us taking you serious.
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:17:55
Better let the well-informed few decide than the ignorant masses.  I am strongly in favor of increasing the block size, but in reality I do not know enough about the consequences of either choice, so letting my vote count as much as a developer's would be stupid.  In most cases I am in favor of democracy, since "enlightened oligarchy" rarely remains enlightened for long - but in this case a bit of meritocracy might be in place :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:25:00
"coinbase transactions" does not refer to the company Coinbase, but to the transaction in the beginning of each block paying the block reward to the miner.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:27:53
But that account would need to have a negative balance.  If all the balances can be seen, then that would stand out like a sore thumb.

Even if you think you can tell that you have not been rooted, it would be hugely irresponsible not to wipe the server and do a full server reinstall before going online.  You can never prove that the hacker did not leave a backdoor.  You can find it if it is there, but you can only be almost sure that it is not there if you do not find it.
Reinstall and restore from backup is standard procedure after a hack.  And it takes time.
Now if the statement really means "we recode everything because our code base is messy and insecure" then we are looking at major downtime and huge problems when/if they come back up.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:43:20
You go to a centralized exchange and buy BTC or BitUSD, of course.
... oh, wait ...

@_date: 2015-01-04 08:12:58
Yes, that is probably the greatest weakness, the developers are aware of the problem.  But that requires a very specific piece of malware targeted at just your setup - far more difficult to pull off than attacks on most other clients.  And the attacker does not know if you run an exotic OS on the offline machine.

He may be right, but honestly:  Is this more than idle speculation and wishful thinking?  I see no shred of evidence (even anecdotal) in this blog posting.

I think you have to live there for seven or ten years, have a steady income, and pass a test in German language and culture. 
If the amount you pay in taxes is so high that it is worth overturning your life to avoid taxes, then what is left after paying taxes is enough to live comfortably. Would you rather have an easy life with 3M$, or live in exile with 4?  If you have nothing, then a million dollars is life-changing.  But if you already have three millions, the fourth isn't!

Actually, if you create a Bitcoin Cash wallet with bitcoin.com, and accidentally send real bitcoin to it, then it automatically makes an extra Bitcoin wallet with your BTC, so they are not lost.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:40:43
But investing $1000 in bitcoin at .70 and cashing out at .80 is the same as investing $1000 at 70000 and caching out at 80000.

If you read his edit: He knew the risk, the exchange did not fool him into this, the possibility that the fork did not happen was part of the price.

Yes you can.  Enter your Electrum seed into a BCH wallet like Electron-Cash, and voilà you have you BCH.
If you are moderately paranoid you may want to move your BTC into a new Electrum wallet first, just in case you get a subverted version of Electron Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:53:14


Well, that depends.  If I need to send you money *once*, then opening a Lightning channel will not help.  If I need to send money to my family halfway across the globe every month, then opening a channel won't  help either, since I am not able to put the money from  next month's paycheck into the channel today.
Channels to a central hub *might* help in some of these cases.  But that is hardly a *decentralized* solution.

It is not particularly difficult to memorize 12 random words.  It is exceedingly difficult to still remember them three years from now.  Even if you refresh your memory regularly, you will without doubt do so less and less regularly over the years, and a some point you will be in doubt.
Any brain wallet that you can remember indefinitely is unsafe.  Any safe brain wallet will eventually be forgotten.
Less seriously: if you plan on dying soon, then maybe a brainwallet allows you to take your money with you after all :)  Your gf / kids / heirs certainly wont get them.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:28:25
THIS is a sensible way to use a brainwallet.  Use the brainwallet for the small change, and the offline storage (Trezor, paper wallet, ...) for the savings.  Too many people do the opposite...
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:50:49
Agreed.  This is a flaw of the protocol.  It pays for a single miner not to validate, but if they all choose not to validate, bitcoin breaks.
I guess the developers are aware of the problem now. :-)   The solution is not obvious, but let's hope it can be fixed.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:41:20
Forgetting the password is by far the most common way if losing bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:37:39
The problem was triggered by blockchain voting, but the real problem was that a small majority of the miners were not validating the blocks they were building upon.  Had that been a significant majority then anyone could have essentially derailed the whole network by producing a single invalid block.
Fortunately, blockchain voting caused that block to appear while the "lazy miners" were only slightly above 50% of the hash rate, and the problem could be fixed before it got out of control.  If it had been 90%, we would have been in big trouble.

If you put them all together and treat is as a 1-of-1 then you are of course safe - unless the house burns and both your computer and the backup burn.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:10:55
TL;DR: If you use fragmented paper backups (N-of-M backups) of your Armory wallet, you should consider your wallet compromised, update Armory, create a new wallet and transfer the funds.
If your fragmented backup is **a header and four lines:** You have the worst form of the vulnerability. **Your private keys may be recovered from just a single fragment!**
If your fragmented backup is a header and two lines: You have a more benign vulnerability. Perhaps there is no real problem, but the Armory developer cannot guarantee the security of the backup, and you should still update.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:55:53
Good, then it is marginally better than what I thought, and a 2-of-3 is still reasonably secure. 
It was my impression that the first fragment gave one point on the polynomium and all coefficients except one (the secret).  But since you were the one discovering the vulnerability I am sure you are correct. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:20:08
Any wallet where you control the keys.  That means not only should the keys be on your computer / hardware device / sheet of paper, but you should also be able to get them into another wallet in case the wallet of your choice ends up not supporting one of the chains (likely).

Have my upvote anyway...
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:08:59
No.  Those schemes leak information, and-or cannot implement a general N-of-M backup.  For example, with xor you need all the fragments, or you have nothing.
The beautiful thing about Shamir's Secret Sharing is that if you have less than N fragments, you have no information whatsoever, but with N fragments or more, you have all the information.
The problem seems to be that it is sufficiently simple and easy to understand, so people are tempted to roll their own version.  And since they understand the algorithm, they also feel safe making tiny, tiny changes to it, that clearly have no implication for the security - except that it actually weakens it.
The only correct way to use any cryptographic algorithm is to import a library that implements it correctly :-)
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:54:59
Yours only has two lines of data, so the *serious* vulnerability does not affect you. There is still something not right in the algorithm, but it requires a competent cryptographer to exploit - if it is exploitable. 
 
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:12:22


I guess it is because SSS is one of the few cryptographic algorithms that are relatively easy to understand.  So it is tempting to make a modification which "clearly" does not influence security.
Every single cryptographic algorithm should be imported from a well-tested, peer-reviewed library written by somebody who knows what they are doing.  That includes SSS.

You just wait till the price is again approximately the same at btc-e and another exchange, buy bitcoins at btc-e and sell it elsewhere.
The typical arb-bot will sell an amount one place and buy another, and then wait till it can do the opposite.  Slushing back and forth, earning a bit every time.
@_date: 2015-04-28 14:08:54
Well, a few hours after the huge difference BTC-e was back in sync with the rest.  Of course that will not happen if the cause of the price difference is a catastrophic failure of one of the exchanges, as we saw with MtGox.
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:12:25
But nobody truly believe that.  The 1% is probably reflecting his real belief of the odds :)
Personally, I think that even under the most optimistic scenarios, it will take a looong time for the price to rise to $1 million.  So long that bitcoin has hopefully been replaced by something better before it happens.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:58:58
That seems very interesting.  Not being able to store the image is impractical, but nothing that cannot be solved with rsync.  I will give them a try tonight.

Hi folks!
Thank you all for your help.  I ended up trying out bitnodes.io, they only take bitcoin and probably resell cloud computing in data centers all over the US.  Signing up requires an email.  They give a 0.075 USD credit on sign up, that is enough to try out their smallest server for a few hours.  Unfortunately, although it was also enough to try their second-smallest server for more than an hour, the system would not allow that.  And I needed it to have enough RAM for a minimal test of my computation.
So I ended up transferring the minimal amount (5 USD) to the site, and playing with a small server for an hour or so.  When I had my small example running, I started a large server and I am now running happily.
You can choose between 10-15 different Linux distribution, I chose the same one I use on my laptop so I could compile my program here. I used scp to move my program and indata to the server (a bit slow from Europe, approx 1 minute for 50 MB).  In less than five minutes I had my program running.  I plan to move the result out by scp in a few hours.
Azure or Amazon EC2 is undoubtedly more convenient for large-scale cloud computing, but for my small hobby project this is fine.
 
Thank you very much for your help!
EDIT: To be honest, one thing is not optimal.  It is too easy to choose a wrong configuration and then click launch.  You can then sit in one minute waiting for it to boot, knowing it will burn one hour of your money and be useless.  Ah well.  If all my mistakes were in the 50 cent category life would be good :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:02:30
Use Armory, print the instructions from their website (bitcoinarmory.com) and store with the paper wallets.  Armory supports n-of-m paper wallets based on Shamir Secret Sharing.
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:00:56
The Armory wallet makes it possible to make a 2-of-3 paper wallet, where you place three paper wallets in three safe places.  Any two of them will be enough to recover the money.  Of course, you can also make 4-of-7 or any other combination.
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:00:04
I am afraid it is only xbox games that you can pay with bitcoin, but maybe they have extended it to Azure.  However, I will need to run linux, I am not sure Microsoft supports that :)
@_date: 2017-06-13 11:51:20
Assume your hardware wallet malfunctions.  Assume your house burns down.  Assume you forget your password.  And make sure you can still get your bitcoins!
One way is to make a 2-of-3 (or 3-of-5) paper backup of your wallet seed with Shamir Secret Sharing, then store it 3 (or 5) different places, including a safe in a bank.  Too few wallets support SSS.
EDIT: Poor mans 2-of-3 wallet.  Take the 12 words of your seed.  Write the first eight on one sheet of paper, the last eight on the second, and the first four + the last four on the third.  Any two sheets may now be used to recover your seed, so if you loose one it is OK.  If a thief gets one, you should still be pretty safe.  Far from as good as SSS, where if you have one part too little you have no info at all.  But decent.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:55:06
Well, I guess that would be kind of OK.  I would prefer not to give them my credit card.  But I do not do anything shady that require me to be anonymous, I simply would prefer to spend my bitcoins on something useful - and support a provider that accepts them.
But thank you very much for your advice both of you for your advice!
