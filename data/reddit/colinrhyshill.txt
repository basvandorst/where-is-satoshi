Will this work even if I can't download the block chain? I ask because I sent the transactions with an old client I think and I'm worried that too might be contributing to the fubar.

Will all wallets have a passphrase? I may have forgotten this one if it did have a passphrase.
Don't believe it had a passphrase. Like I said in another post the option to change password was greyed out and encrypt wallet was black.

Backed up my wallet to my desktop, imported it to blockchain.info and got the following error message:
 
Unexpected end of file from server
EDIT: found bitcoin wallet in application support, tried uploading original file and got the same error

Tried dumpprivkey with my bitcoin address but got the following error: Invalid Bitcoin address (code -5)
I don't believe I have a password set up as "change password" is greyed out under setting and "encrypt wallet" is not black and clickable under settings.

Ok this looks like the simplest. If this works you'll have to send me a wallet address so I can send you your bounty.

How risky is this? It looks promising though, I might try this in the morning. One further detail: am doing this all on a Mac

So this is the error I got (it's elsewhere in the thread as well)
Tried dumpprivkey with my bitcoin address but got the following error: Invalid Bitcoin address (code -5)

I think you might be correct. Am I fucked? Did bitcoin literally software upgrade me out of my money?
Here's the data on the original transaction that put the bitcoin in my wallet.
Status: 122147 confirmations

with transaction ID if that's useful...
