I lost over 90% over a period of 2 years on oil futures. I don't even think about how much anymore. Moral of the story... GET OUT IF YOU ARE EVEN A LITTLE HESITANT. I stuck it out till the fund bent belly up and pulled 4k out.

Let me take this moment to reflect on blame.... Yes, it was my fault. And not yours. This is how the market works.

Oh I see where you are going with this. I figured the world population is growing and oil will be king for a couple more decades.

I never said it was anybody else's fault.  To put your worries to rest, it was my fault. Although I'm not sorry. However the fact remains that it was totally my decision to take the risk and the ensuing loss or gain. That's how the market works.

I don't own bitcoin but I think it has value in commerce as a medium of exchange without a middleman. Also smart contracts are something we will all benefit from. I think its value keeps climbing because we are all just realizing how valuable the technology can be.

I saw as have billions others, saw it go up and away above the clouds. I have nothing in this game. I'd love to watch it come down only because I didn't get in at the ground floor. I see its value both as a currency and also as a technology. 
However something is bothering me that I don't understand. Who is going to pay the electric bill to keep all those transactions online? The only way is for this thing to keep going up. What happens when we reach the peak? A crash? What happens to all those contracts when the lights go out? Ok ok, that's a doomsday scenario. Get back to buying.
