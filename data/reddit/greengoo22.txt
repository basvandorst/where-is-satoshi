Is there any benefit to making the ecosystem build fee infrastructure now rather than delaying that process? This is the only upside to not bumping the block size that I can see. I'm torn though as to whether this is important or not. Id say better now than when the ecosystem is larger.

Orphaned blocks are a very real thing.

The issue is that there is a point where the growth of the chain will exceed a nodes ability to catch up.

Is creating a UTXO snapshot and treating it as a genesis block feasible?
What information is in the history of a coin which we would lose this way? Are these use cases within the scope of Bitcoin?
Thanks for the other scaling insights.

Now this is something I have been waiting a long time for! After some vetting this might be my keepass replacement.

Does this impact attacks which attempt to correlate and or localize transaction origins in the p2p network?

Can someone point me to some proposals or pieces of the tech which would eventually become validation of subsets of the chain.  Or validation of the chain to a point where I trust my transactions are valid regardless of the rest of the chain?
It is mentioned at the end of the talk and I haven't read enough about it.

I can see no logic in this set of statements.

On the topic of broadcast but unmined transactions or transactions stuck in or dropped from the mempool.
I find it interesting that one can keep a copy of these transactions and rebroadcast them at will. Or more likely, a miner could mine one at will. To be antagonistic a miner could wait until the old transaction is double spent and then mine the old one.
Someone certainly has all the unmined transactions they have ever seen. Do we know of any real risks to users with broadcast unmined transactions. Do we know of anything else harmful that could be done.

My additional disorganized observations from the Distributed Trade conference.
In general I thought very few people there knew what they were talking about.

I think this is my misunderstanding. Thanks for the reply. Now I can read about this.

Can multiple addresses be generated for a single private key?
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:49:28
Thanks that makes a ton more sense. 
Can you comment on how bitcoin core handles change addresses? Is a new random private key generated each time? How would a backup of my wallet.dat backup my change addresses created as I make transactions post backup.

This may not be the cheapest up front but long term I decided it was more cost effective:
It is somewhat future proof in that the memory and storage can be upgraded. 4 x 2Ghz cores is plenty for verification unless we go full data center mode. Further, it's capable enough to run something like a lightning node or join market and other layer 2 services you might want to run.
I have a 512 Gb drive and 8Gb ram in mine.
