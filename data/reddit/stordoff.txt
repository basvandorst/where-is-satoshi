Ideally, you would have one user-specific salt stored in the database and a site-specific salt in the source code for the system. Using this system, a simple SQL injection can't expose the entire salt. If both are sufficiently complex, brute-forcing will be infeasible without compromising both the database and the source code.

Most of the time, the salt does appear in the database. The salt acts to prevent rainbow table or dictionary attacks, where most of the computation can be pre-done. By adding a per-user salt, the computation must be redone for each user.

Poclbm works fine under OS X. You need to install Xcode and [PyOpenCL]( but then you can just follow any guide for poclbm mining.

MtRed seem to be doing OK so far.

Not really. My 3 year old GPU is pulling 75MHash/s, and the card I just purchased for £70 will do 170-200MHash/s.

Running the following in Terminal should work:
/Path/To/Bitcoin.app/Contents/MacOS/bitcoin -server
For example, /Application/Bitcoin.app/Contents/MacOS/bitcoin -server
To get bitcoind, I _think_ you need to compile it yourself.

Exactly what I'm doing. Long(ish) term, I'll stick with MtRed, but for now going after the bounties makes sense (particularly given I'm broke ATM).

It adds to the circumstantial evidence, but it's hardly conclusive. For a variety of reasons, I've been waking at around 2pm local time (UK), and not sleeping until between 4 and 6am. If you analysed my online activity, you see it's been consistently like that for 2+ years and 7 days a week.

That may be more to do with wanting to remove his contact details from whois, rather than for actual anonymity reasons. Putting a real email in whois is a decent way to attract spam (and it'll be targeted enough to avoid spam filters).
[I'm already getting that sort of spam]( regarding an domain I registered a few days ago. The volume is fairly trivial, but more than I'd expect for a domain that hasn't been advertised and its only purpose is to forward to an existing site.
It's also possible his registrar opted him in without it really being a concious choice. I don't know if any do that be default, but 123reg push it pretty hard (frankly its off-putting - only reason I've stuck with them is that I know their DNS servers are solid and easy to configure. If I didn't need that, their business practices would make me consider switching).

Even if the laptop is brand new and from a trusted source, the USB stick is tainted when the signature was copied to it. Drop an exploit on it at the same time, and the "brand new" laptop could very easily have, for example, false root certs added (to bypass SSL and download a fake copy of Electrum) or be running a daemon which patches Electrum after downloading.
If the laptop is brand new, then it's probably a) unpatched and b) in a known state. Creating an exploit which runs silently under those conditions would be fairly straight-forward. Unless the USB contents were examined AFTER Wright added the signature but BEFORE connecting it to the new laptop, I'd say that procedure is just smoke-and-mirrors around a flawed verification setup.

To expand on this a little, the main relevant sections of the Act that would be relevant (as far as I can see) are 6(1), 6(5)(a), and 41(1): 






IIRC, money's worth includes vouchers, goods, etc. - effectively anything that has value - and so Bitcoins seem to quite easily fall in that category. Therefore, I'm fairly sure an operating licence would be required for activities under s.41 (for example). Anyone operating within the UK should probably check that they are in compliance with the Act.

On a optimistic estimate of your hashrate (380MH/s), you would expect to mine ฿0.04 ($2.37 at current price) per day. That'll only go down as the difficulty increases. I'd be surprised if that is enough to be profitable, unless you get very cheap power.


I'd work, but you probably won't get it for a while ("Bitforce SC (ASIC) products are in final stage development with initial shipping scheduled for the last half of March 2013. Products are shipped according to placement in the order queue, and delivery may take 2 months or more after order"). By that point, every who ordered before you will have theirs online, increasing the difficulty. Possibly worth a punt if you can afford to lose the $150, but I suspect it'll be a while before you see a return.

I think that's GCHQ. NSA's version is GREAT EXPECTATIONS.

I still kick myself for selling 21BTC at $1-2 each back in April (ish) 2011. It seemed like such a good idea at the time...
