Moon is overused, and the 'hodl' thing was annoying at first but now I'm used to it.

There's no central authority to say what is what - that's what's so new about decentralized systems.

Missed a comma. Should read "Segwit, Bitcoin &amp; Lightening Network"

LN is so complicated...Bcash transactions cost less than a penny.

Hit $6,480 usd today on Bitfinex. Could be a hell of a lot higher in 14 days - that's like 1 year in crypto time.

It's truly something that has never happened before. Very difficult to model. I would be equally fascinated if it went to &lt;$1,000 again. What could even cause that?

Serious money entering space from big players could be a factor. Their clients will start demanding it. The stock market can swing by BTC's entire market cap in just a few days. What if some of that money comes into play?

I think one year in crypto time involves much more change than one might think. Wouldn't surprise me if Amazon accepts BTC. Amazon has made announcements in the past simply to get attention, like their drone-delivery commercial before a Black Friday or two ago. Accepting BTC and immediately converting to USD is all the same to them anyway.
