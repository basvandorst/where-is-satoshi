Some combination of Antbleed, Bitfinex withdrawls and that we're kind of over the $100 price increases. Bring on the $1000 price swings we're ready for the big leagues.
Me personally I don't think Bitfinex will end insolvency. I feel like they would have frozen BTC withdraws by now. They said they're working on a one time withdraws for USD and we have an address of their cold wallet.
The Antbleed thing is a bit more concerning. We need to figure out how to get more independent miners running trustworthy hardware. It's going to be tough to do. Hopefully in-home circuit printing is on it's way.

Fair enough. It just bothers me when non-node operators are take it for granted that we would be fine with 16mb blocks for free. But as a node operator yourself you have the right to make that assertion so good for you.

Since you are new I would highly recommend you always perform a test before playing with 10k of bitcoin. Test buys. Test withdrawals. Test paper wallets. Not only is it somewhat complex but there is no customer support. If you make a mistake your coins could disappear forever. Be careful.
That being said, when used correctly Bitcoin is very secure.

Sorry, I guess I should be more clear. I don't consider password practices and account protection to be digital security. Web security maybe. But its digital pseudo security. I know that's not the common usage but I believe if we start using the terms that way it would be more semantically correct and result in better mass adoption.

I'm going to pretend you're one of my completely non-techie friends:
So, there's a kind of function in programming called a hashing function. Basically it accepts any input and will spit out a number that is impossible to predict. Of course there's no such thing as a perfect hashing function so eventually this is no longer true but that's the ideal. Anyway, the point is, if I give you numerical hash nobody should be able to tell me how I created that hash. This is really useful for proving original authorship. If I write an original book and put it into a hashing function nobody in the world but me knows how to create that hash result.
*This usually prompts some questions which I answer quickly.*
So, like I said there's no way to predict what the hash result will be. And bear in mind these hash result numbers are massive. We're talking on the order of stars in the universe or the number of atoms that make up planet earth. Going back to my book example, let's say the hashing function returns a big number. Like, forty quadrillion or whatever. If I change a single letter in that book and run the function again the number will be vastly different. It could be ten thousand or something comparatively small.
*People usually don't understand where I'm going with this and I can sense I'm starting to lose them so I tell them to hang on to that.*
So, because it's random and because it computationally expensive you can make a race out of it. You can tell a whole bunch of people "Okay everybody, try to find a hash that is less than fifty billion. Ready? Go." This is a competition that anyone on the internet can participate in. You can use your phone or a super computer. They're all capable of performing these calculations. Of course the super computer is most likely to win but occasionally the smartphone could too.
That's bitcoin mining in a nutshell.
*At this point I let the questions drive the conversation. For a lot of people this explanation satisfies their curiosity and gives them a level of respect for what's being done.*

I just talk about being stoked when the price is moving. Usually they don't say anything. Sometimes they ask questions. I figure just knowing I know about it and use it is enough. If they have questions they know who to ask.

I understand why bitcoin is innovative and exciting. I just don't know what kind of blockchain implementation you're using. Most of the ones I've seen lauded by banks still maintain centralized authority of the ledger hence my question. So are you saying your bank is looking into a blockchain backed by proof of work?

"Very long term hodlers" is a more apt description. As coins are lost or destroyed these will unlock again.

Cold storage is any wallet secured with a key you are confident has never been on an internet connected device. For example you can download a little JavaScript program and put it on a raspberry pi using a thumb drive. Copy the app, disconnect the thumb drive and create a wallet. Copy the public address using the camera on your phone. Never connect that Pi to the internet or put any storage which was connected to it after you generated the wallet.
Of course their are orders of magnitude more secure measures you can take. Making sure you never use any peripherals on other devices either. Theoretically a mouse or keyboard could have some secret storage. Doing all of this inside a Faraday cage so no one can detect any other signals the pi might be giving off.
In my mind these latter examples seem a bit like overkill for anyone working with 50btc or less but everybody has their own level of acceptable risk.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:43:45
Hodlers are the least affected by all this bitcoin drama. Even in the case of a contentious hard fork we wouldn't have to do anything right away. There would be some considerations once we try to move, sell or spend but they would all be very manageable and plenty of people would offer guides on how to do it properly.

I think you're unaware of the difference between "running" BU and "signalling" BU. The former would cause a fork in the chain and the top posts of this sub would all have the word fork in them. Signalling is a vote. It just says that they're ready to mine BU.

The same way you would today. Technically you don't "create" a wallet. You make up a key and use it to sign a transaction.
If you're asking how to set up a specific mobile wallet implementation you'd have to wait for a software update which would make it capable of handling both chains. Though, like I said this should come out quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:51:07

If you're planning on hodling you don't need to worry about any of this. That being said, you should get your bitcoin off of coinbase regardless. Get a paper wallet or a hardware wallet ASAP.

I run a node. How do I go about this?

There are much cheaper and more effective redundancy implementations when you can rely on a centralized authority.
@_date: 2017-07-08 16:11:15
So after the split what all coins are vulnerable to what is called a replay attack. Essentially if you create a valid transaction on chain A then it's likely that transaction is valid on chain B. So let's say you make a purchase on Amazon and they accept chain A coins. You build the transaction, sign it and broadcast it. The coins move from your wallet on chain A to Amazon's wallet on chain A. When you broadcast a transaction everyone can see it. So *anybody* can take that transaction and send it over to the chain B network and suddenly those coins have moved as well.
The way to fix this is to first move coins on both chains to different addresses you control. chain A coins go to X address and chain B coins go to Y address. Broadcast both transactions at the same time. Now, you are still vulnerable to a replay attack but since you control both the X and Y wallets all a successful attack means is you'll have to try again. However usually this will work on the first try.
Once chain A coins are on X and chain B coins are on Y where X and Y are wallets you control you are no longer vulnerable to a replay attack since Y will be empty on chain A and X will be empty on chain B.
Of course doing this will probably require you to deal with some raw transactions so it's still a bit complex. However I expect the major mobile wallet makers to implement this feature rather quickly so you could just hold tight until then.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:05:16
Just a note: there's a perfectly secure method of avoiding a replay attack. Or at least, immunizing it's effects down to a slight nuisance. In practice it might take a few tries but once it's done you've got full independent control of your coins on separate chains.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:15:46

@_date: 2017-06-24 17:41:02
Every bitcoin transaction has a fee and moving your bitcoin from coinbase to a personal wallet requires a transaction. That being said, exchanges have different pricing structures and some subsidize the transaction fees somewhat.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:30:23
Perhaps you know something I don't. My understanding was you could do the following:
1. You have coins A and B on the same address in different chains.
2. You create two wallets, X and Y.
3. Broadcast transactions for A-&gt;X and B-&gt;Y.
4. If a replay attack occurs you will either have A-&gt;X and B-&gt;X or A-&gt;Y and B-&gt;Y. You control the keys to both wallets so return to step 1 and try again.
5. Otherwise you now have coins on separate addresses in each chain and are no longer vulnerable to replay attacks as X has no value on the Y chain and Y has no value on the X chain.
Admittedly this is a bit technical to pull off but I don't see why an update to your favorite wallet software wouldn't be able to simplify the user experience.
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:28:06
Uhhh... Ok
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:41:33
Perhaps you've already done this but unless you're actively trading I would highly recommend you move your bitcoin to a personal wallet. Maybe just a little at first while you get used to it but just know if you don't control the private key you don't control your bitcoin. Coinbase is definitely on their game more than MtGOX but hacks can still happen.

Because a centralized authority can trust the ledger to be whatever the authority claims it to be you don't need all the other functionality of a decentralized authority cryptocurrency. It's like building a car that can float when you have no intention of driving it near water. It works but you've got a lot of useless features slowing you down.
