This is a subliminal message for Pickachu on acid. Friggin boom is a vendor on Gangsta's Paradise and this is the stealth.

Nobody likes a scammer.

It could and I think would eventually take over all payment apps once people know.

Was just thinking the same. I just checked out your sub. You have live cash games for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:44:06
Yes they are. They have the direct connection with Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:04:55
We sell food for cash. Then buy bitcoin. Then buy city in China.

Not an excuse a power like him makes the rules. This is the exact same thing going on in the darknet. There is groups censoring everything then praising themselves as a savior when the point of bitcoin is freedom.

The Deja vu... for some reason I feel like I have seen this before.
@_date: 2019-03-02 21:16:29
I'm building a city in Italy for bitcoins. I am no ball buster. All I have is my word and my balls.

It is so rediculous and getting worse everyday. The sub just got around 200 new memebers all shill I have never seen claiming to be vendors and giving shit opsec advice trying to help. Somebody even called out one of the guy for scamming and the mods didn't do anything but make it harder to post. All these accounts were being used to be ready to be able to post in any sub. So now it is full of all and only scammers. Reddit and all of these major corperations are pulling so many scams and they only make it tighter and harder for legit people to warn others. The internet needs a huge change!

I like it but not for bitcoin. Reminds me more of Mario Luigi.

When Doge takes over buttcoin will be 0. Plane tickets for everyone!
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:58:48
I use bitcoin. Screw congress.
@_date: 2019-03-10 17:33:28
Mother Russia for the win!
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:00:29
They want that bitcoin money. They aren't stupid.
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:09:24
Can't even wipe your ass with a petro.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:26:49
Fees too high!
