Yes keep it in Coinbase unless you're trying to sell during peak time or willing to buy a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:43
Interesting. Thanks

absofuckinglutley do it

If you can't deal with that small of a fee on that large of an investment you should probably get out of BTC
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:32:44
That's the downside to keeping your coin off of an exchange, it will take a while to sell. No real way to catch a quick rise/fall unlesss its on an exchange

Not the price, but it absolutely will have an effect on how you get it and how hard it is to obtain

GDAX has account creating issues. Half the people trying to hook up their coinbase account are rejected

The best for me is:

Physical bitcoins don't exist. Buy him 100 bucks worth and put it on a paper wallet. Explain to him how it works.

Way too late to start mining unless you're trying to pump out thousands and thousands of dollars for an unpromised return

Whered you buy from?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:18:20
Coinbase because I don't want to bust $75 on a physical wallet and transferring back and forth all the time isn't worth the fees and trouble

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:38
So the price should be going down soon, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:43:49
What does everyone think about the current price? I want to sell and rebuy if there is a drop, but do we think there will be another drop like it has in the days past? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:16:59
Ha! I live in New Orleans, neither have I! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:29:19
So it's still locked? How can you tell when its going to be open?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:09:43
That has nothing to do with it dipping at 15k

Well it hit 10,800 a day ago... it hasn't peaked. This is so stupid
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:16:56
For me I started using it on a website for sports betting. It's illegal in my state so bitcoin is the only way to stay anonymous. Over time I watched the value rise and fall, and I started paying more and more attention to the market. Now I'm riding it in full swing
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:31:05
My scenario is that I use them in a betting account, so I would be storing BTC in the wallet and most likely only cashing it out once, but over time adding more BTC to the wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:26:22
Moving any amount of BTC from coinbase to a DESKTOP wallet is infinitely more dangerous than keeping it on coinbase itself. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:24:34
I think it is going to be teetering between 9k and 10k for the next week or so before we see it steadily increase again. This is all the people buying and selling because of the news. Once they fizzle out everything will be normal again and the climb will be back on. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:34:08
Sounds like your shit is broken and no one elses. Fix your bum ass internet
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:30:03
GDAX can handle big amounts lol. I said small amounts because of the fees. The fees on coinbase are usually pretty small. So obviously someone transferring $20 worth will care about a fee but someone transferring $2,000 worth wont care as much about the fee
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:56
If you're not planning on buying a $75 hardware wallet you might as well keep it in coinbase and save yourself some trouble 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:19:28
Only if you don't want to pay tax. Also only if you have more than 20k available in the accounts. Also if they're hitting coinbase its going to happen to everyone else, only a matter of time
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:05
BTC at $5k - Is now a good time to invest?

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:02:02
Quickly isn't very possible if you're on a hardware wallet. If you're trying to sell as quickly as possible it's pointless to have a hardware wallet. Just keep the coin in Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:22:40
GDAX is great. If you're using small amounts or cant deal with the fees then go for it. This is just my personal opinion. I personally deal off my phone so I just find coinbase infinitely easier to operate, obviously because of their app. I hate moving things back and forth, thats why I say if you're buying and trading off coinbase all the time you might as well just keep it there. Again, just my opinion here
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:36:23
Whats the question here
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:51
Not dropping that low 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:44:09
But then I have no way of telling how much is in the wallet besides memory or logging on and transferring, right?

It's not. If GDAX doesn't say it, it's not real
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:16:26
9700 is too high. Its literally under that now. Wait until its under 9k, but that could be only for around an hour
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:49:03
Coinbase is probably more secure than risking traveling to any of the software wallets tbh. If you want safer than coinbase get it into a hardware wallet which will run you around 75 bucks 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:40:34
Nothing, but if your priority is safety you should keep it in Coinbase rather than risk moving it through the internet into a different location. Only downside of Coinbase is if you're trying to sell/buy when everyone else is and the servers choke up. But at the same time if you're trying to sell from a different wallet you're probably going to try coinbase anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:31:42
If you're not willing to buy a $75 hardware wallet then keep it in Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:57:56
Oh mighty where are you now with your prediction? You did so well 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:29:22
It's a good amount for me. Right now it's at $380. Is a paper wallet safe?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:57:36
Right because the circlejerk against coinbase in this sub is insane. If you're planning on selling or buying during the crazy times like yesterday when btc dropped and rose incredibly fast, then sure get it out of coinbase. Any other scenario it's fine to keep it in there. All of my BTC ETH and LTC is in coinbase and I dont plan on moving it anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:22:22
Wtf. It'll be $100 minus the $11
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:54
It was literally at 8500 yesterday dummy
