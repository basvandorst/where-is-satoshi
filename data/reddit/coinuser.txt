Probably because Wikipedia is seen as a threat to those people.
Why buy expensive textbooks or advice from your doctor when you can get that information for free on the internet? Esp. when the info on wikipedia is monitored and kept up to date by thousands of volunteers, while the institution releasing that text book has it's own personal agenda and motive.
Plus it's a lot easier to update a website when new facts become available, and websites use far less of our limited resources than old school printed books. Definitely not as profitable as the current university business model, though.

Both of those are victimless crimes, and therefore, not so morally reprehensible. Cyber harassment or bullying, on the other hand... That's a pretty sick crime.

They can write it sure, but it'll be taken down as soon as someone notices the info is incorrect. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:08:38
True, and if anyone has access to any interesting old guides and things, please make sure to upload them to the net so that information isn't lost in the future.

I agree. ⓢ 100,000, or 100,000 ⓢ . They both look nice &amp; clean. ��

Or add two more bars so it matches the Bitcoin symbol?

It's here:

The @ is simple, but I think it would be too confusing. I really like this symbol u/Dunan suggested, though: ⓢ

Total: ⓢ 200,000

Why not, though? There's already a small/medium sized all BTC economy. All it has to do is keep growing, and I don't really see that stopping anytime soon.

Tippin.me? Yeah, I was using a similar tip bot until my Twitter account got suspended, then banned, &amp; I lost access to all of my funds. ��
I miss the old Reddit tip bot, changetip, I think? Really wish that was still a thing!

Does this work? There's a LN tip bot?!
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:55:13
I disagree. Look at the history of the internet as an example. If you were using "the internet" when it was only 8 years old, then I'd say you were definitely still an early adopter there.

I had a few bitcoins stolen from my btc-e account in the past. I also had a good password, plus 2fa, and never got any email that someone else had logged in other than myself. Btc-e was extremely unhelpful when I contacted them about the issue. I still don't have access to that account and they wouldn't help me get it back or figure out how my account was taken over. Instead they just accused me of being the one trying to gain access to an account that was obviously mine...

Is there no picture from their site you could add? I just think it'd be helpful to your visitors if you had a pic of the card on there, and I obviously didn't mean post your own with all the details...
@_date: 2016-02-07 00:35:00
Is this an actual card that you get, or some kind of virtual thing? I wasn't sure from the article. If it is an actual card I'd love to see a picture of it.
Also you should add a link or two to the Shift card on your review. I had to go to the tutorial page to find a link, and even there it's kinda hard to find.

No, it's actually a completely valid complaint and it's really sad to see so many people here just dismissing you and saying that it's not...
Personally I'm a huge fan of bitcoin and I think it's an awesome technology. But it's not without problems and as you've pointed out, converting fiat to BTC is a pretty huge issue at the moment.


This is so true, and there's plenty of other people in your situation who can't just easily drive to a bank to deposit money, and there's plenty more who either aren't willing or able to use any kind of id to buy them.
Unfortunately the reason for this seems to be because of too many government regulations regarding who can buy and sell coins and what license they need to legally do that, so I'm really not sure how it could even be fixed at this point. I do however know that if we all just ignore this problem it's only going to continue to turn people off to bitcoin because they can't figure out any easy way to buy them.
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:27:59
This site has them also for 1.19btc each:
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:14:58
Yes, bitcoin is considered a virtual currency, but unlike those other in-game currencies, Fincen has recently decided to treat bitcoin more like the USD than like WoW gold. So if they're going to start using these regulations against bitcoin businesses then they also need to start making and enforcing laws to deal with issues like this.
IMO, the OP has more than enough proof for his roommate to be convicted of theft charges, and this seems like it would be the perfect case to take to court and let a jury decide the outcome. Or at the very least talk to a lawyer about it, and get their advice instead of just listening to everyone here speculate about what might or might not happen and assuming it's not worth the time.
@_date: 2013-06-06 07:20:42


And again I would disagree with you. Assuming everything he's told us here is the truth, then yes, to me it's completely obvious and beyond a reasonable doubt as to who stole those coins.
@_date: 2013-06-28 18:50:47
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:55:58
That's actually a really good idea, but look up your local laws first bc in some states it's illegal to record someone without their permission.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:46:22


But if you really believed in the technology itself then why wouldn't you also accept litecoin or doge coin or any other crypto which uses that same technology? They can easily be traded for BTC if that's what you prefer, so why decline it? That seems kinda hypocritical to me...
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:10:14
I keep seeing people here saying that the transaction fee is optional, but from what I understand that's not exactly the case?
I know that when I tried sending coins to the reddit tip bot w/o including it they were returned to me by the blockchain after several days of no confirmations. And I've read that it's possible for your transaction to just get stuck and never be confirmed if it has no fee, but I'm not 100% sure about that...
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:48:04
At this point it might even be worth it to get the police involved, especially if you're planning on taking further legal action against this person. I know everyone here is saying they won't do anything and it's not worth it, but none of us know that for sure, and you should at least call them and see what they can do before just giving up so easily.
If it were me I probably wouldn't even mention the fact that it's in bitcoin at first. Just tell them your roommate stole money from one of your online accounts and then when you confronted him he immediately moved out all of his things and left. That's sketchy, and I think they'll take you seriously. It's possible they could even seize his computer so that you could eventually get some of them back, but you need to take action ASAP instead of waiting around and giving him time to hide them better or destroy any other evidence.
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:31:08
The problem right now with using bitcoin as a currency is the fact the value is changing every few seconds which makes it hard to buy or sell anything w/o someone taking a loss due to the exchange rates. Maybe if the prices weren't so crazy it could work but for now there are a lot of issues.
For example, when shopping with bitcoin it's super annoying when one minute I can afford to buy something that's in my cart, but by the time I've filled out my info and I'm ready to click submit button the price has already changed and now I don't have enough coins in my account to make the purchase... So then I have to go back to my wallet, send more coins, wait for those to confirm, and by then who knows what the price is going to be?
Most people are not going to go through all that trouble and risk to buy something online when they could easily just use paypal or their credit/debit card like they've been doing for years now. I guess the exception to this is Silk Road and other bitcoin only marketplaces, but lately I think even those places are having issues w/ the extreme volatility of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-04 15:55:18
Ok, I'll try it out: 
@_date: 2013-07-02 20:43:29
But I think it has everything to do with their being dysfunctional at the moment...
Why was BitFloor's bank account closed? Because I'm pretty sure that it wasn't due to lack of business or from people not using them. And as for Bitinstant, they've always worked great for me and I've gotten my coins before I even finished paying them, but now that they're trying to comply with these new regulations apparently they can't accept money from certain places anymore.
These same laws are also making it too difficult and expensive to start a business buying and selling coins, so for now that's why it's so damn hard to convert USD to and from bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-06 07:09:00
You can get a consultation first without actually hiring them. If it were me I'd go through a list of local lawyers and call them up asking if they know anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-06 07:06:05


Couldn't he still be considered to be in possession of stolen property, or something like that though? Especially if it were proven that the coins originally came from OP's address.
Also it's possible this roommate still has some kind of evidence on his computer. This is why it still seems like a good idea to get the police involved, although I'm not sure exactly what it would take for them to get a warrant in order to search his stuff.
@_date: 2013-07-06 02:51:34
But anyone who has that much invested in bitcoin is going to want the price to stay high, so I just don't see that happening, or at least not on a very large scale. I mean surely most people would realize that just immediately dumping all their coins like that is not the greatest idea.
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:41:42
But there's no guarantee that will happen again for anyone who buys this week, and it's entirely possibly the opposite will happen and their investment will be worth a lot less in two more weeks.
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:56:05
Actually speculative traders love all of this volatility because they can profit from it, while those of us who only want to use bitcoin as a currency are getting screwed by it. Why would anyone buy a coin today if they're just going to wake up and find that it's worth so much less tomorrow?
Personally my plan was only to save and spend the coins I bought, but I ended up losing so much money by letting them sit in my wallet that I had to start trading and speculating on the price. I definitely don't want to be a bitcoin day trader, but as long as the prices are up and down like this it would be stupid of me to just keep holding my coins while they continue to lose so much value.
So yeah, I'd say this is kind of a problem, especially since most people are probably not going to start trading their coins like I have. They'll just see that the coins they bought are not worth as much as they originally paid, and then be turned off to bitcoin in the future because they've lost so much money from buying and saving them.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:01:46
That's not what I believe, but I guess I can see how you might get that.
I was trying to make pretty much the same point: it's a crap shoot and could go up or down, and just because two weeks ago it doubled doesn't mean it will again. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 05:24:19


 
The hard part isn't creating a good company to buy/sell bitcoins, it's the fact that such a company now has to deal with all these bullshit regulations from the US government and FINCEN in order to have a legitimate business.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:22:29
So he just shouldn't even try because of that? I say take him to court, or at least talk to a lawyer about it before you just give up so easily.
@_date: 2013-05-30 00:05:07
They do look similar at first, but instead of dropping a lot lower after the fear stage bitcoin turns itself around and continues to grow.
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:24:42
For that transaction it might be reasonable, but what if you want to send a much smaller amount of coins? For example what if I only want to send one satoshi, but the minimum fee to send it (at least w/multibit) is still 0.0001? In that case you would be paying more in transaction fees than the amount you're actually sending to someone, and while this might not be a huge problem now it seems like it will be if the price keeps rising.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:25:50
You don't know that for sure. Op should find a lawyer who knows something about bitcoin and get their opinion instead of listening to random people on reddit who have no idea what they're talking about half the time...
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:50:10
I wouldn't base my entire decision on that, no, but it is something I'd at least take into consideration.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:16:24
Well two weeks ago you would have been buying low(er) and could now sell high(er), but if you buy now at the highest price and bitcoin crashes tomorrow, then it might be awhile or even never until you could sell again for a profit.
Not that I think that's what's going to happen, I'm just saying it's possible.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:30:12
It's not definitive to YOU, however to me and plenty of others here it seems to be pretty obvious who took the coins. Either way he should talk to a lawyer about it and not just rely on the opinion of reddit for legal advice.
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:56:02
So how do you deal with the fact that Tails needs to be updated so often to stay secure? Do you just provide a new drive for every update, or what?
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:50:44
No, get the police involved now. Otherwise he's going to have more time to hide all of these coins and the chance you'll ever recover them is greatly reduced.
