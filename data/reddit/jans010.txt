Yes I did, as I was reminded how strongly you were opposed even the thought that it might tank again ;)

But there is free competition between banks to offer the lowest fees for their services, while krypto exchanges currently act in an oligopoly. Also isn’t the target picture that we all Need krypto exchanges in the future as we will all be using krypto? Then we’d also be as dependent on them as now in banks. The idea is the Same, just the lifecycle is different. 
So bottom line there is NO reason as a krypto enthusiast and investor to celebrate how much Binance squeezes out its early mover advantage.

Anyone else besides me checked CMC for prices after reading this „trending“ headline?

We better hope the support level holds.

Same goes for banks so I don’t see the point.

So funny how quickly the fanboys regained confidence :-D 
Of course the upwards move to 7,5k gives lots of people some relief during this downtrend, but it’s by far not a trend reversal yet, the long term downwards movement in 2018 is still intact. So far it’s just a little bounce up towards the upper range of the downtrend. Can easily be followed by the next slump to 6k and then maybe even lower. Actually it’s by far more likely that we see 6k again before we see 9-10k. 
Let’s hope for the best though.
