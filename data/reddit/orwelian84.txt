Listen to this man, he is absolutely speaking the truth. While it might not be likely, crypto is still a very volatile and speculative investment. The market could very easily get spooked and drop by &gt;50% and not fully recover for  years, it's happened before. Prudence is almost always the best strategy.

I kinda feel like ETH and LTC aren't really Altcoins. Maybe it's because they are the 3 coins traded on Coinbase, but Coinbase is like the most popular non-day trader exchange in the US. To me an Altcoin is anything you can't buy with USD not USD-T mind you, but actual fiat.

If you are a USC and you are going to actively trade you absolutely must be diligent in your record keeping. At present every single trade is a capital gains taxable moment. Buying and holding is one thing, day trading is an altogether different story.

you are falling prey to anthropomorphism. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:01:26
actually I would argue that BTC has higher intrinsic value because it has lower, in real terms, transactional costs and since the function of currency is to facilitate transactions the cheaper the transaction cost the better. 
BTC value is proportional to its relatively cheap transactional costs.

I will check them out, thanks for the tip. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:49:54
to be fair though, nothing, not even gold, has inherent or intrinsic value. All value is subjectively defined. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:08:47
I don't disagree that bitcoins themselevs, even when limited to the modern day, have no intrinsic value. 
However, what they enable(cheaper, anonymous, exchange) does have intrinsic value(when limited to just the modern day). Currencies with lower transactional costs are "more valueable" than currencies with higher costs. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:56:43
no, you defined it from your frame of reference. An objective definition would be true from all points of reference. The idea that "utility" is valuable is itself a social construct. 
edit - Objective does not mean rational. Your definition was rational, not disputing that, but it was still socially defined from the reference point of utility as a good. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:49:13
Okay, that what is your point?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:25:57
absolutely agree, digital currencies allow for finer grained responses to changes in local, regional, and global markets imo. Thus they are more "valueable" as mediums for exchange imo. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:45:15
This is particularly relevant right now because of the possibility/probability that the run up in value of BC is related to the Euro-zone crisis. 
In order to answer the question, "why has BTC gone up in value" you necessarily have to accept that value is socially/situationally defined. It seems to me that by asking these questions we might avoid more bubbles/crashes.
edit - spelling

Also checks are just a proxies for cash which adds additional transactions costs. The more moving parts in a system the less efficient, due to friction, said system is.

If it isn't universal, than it isn't intrinsic and is socially defined.

as with tom, just want you to know I have very much enjoyed our back and forth. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:03:57
Gold on the other had has very high transactional costs, not least of which is either minting it, storing it, or transporting it. 
Fiat money beat out commodity based money for exactly this reason. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:59:29
If it is socially constructed it cannot be inherent. 
I think artificially limiting our discussion of value to just modern societies risks reinforcing modern perceptual biases and closes off avenues of development(in the cultural sense).

Protons are an intrinsic element of baryonic matter, ALL baryonic matter has protons. 
Universality is a requirement for defining something as being "intrinsic".

Just because something has utility doesn't make it intrinsically valuable. 
Yes it can be used in electronics, does that mean that the aboriginal peoples of Australia will find it valueable for the same reasons? No. 
If you were stranded on a desert island what would be more valuable a hunk of gold or a flask of water. 
Value is socially/situationally defined. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:23:34
That may be true, its inherent value though is only from the reference point of conduction being a "good". If you don't want conduction, but instead resistance, gold probably isn't that valuable to you. Illustrating the point that the value to gold is socially/situationally defined and thus not intrinsic. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:23:42
If no one accepted BTC as a medium for exchange they could still be useful, or rather the algorithms that gave rise to them could be useful. 
Your statement that paper can be burnt or gold used is not evidence for intrinsic value, but evidence for practical utility. Those two things are not synonymous.
I am not saying that things have no value or that utility isn't good, I am merely stating that their value is socially constructed and this is relevant to the current value of BTC and fiat currencies more generally.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:24:58
Up front the costs are higher to switch systems, just like it was when we switched from Gold backed to fiat currency, the transition cost more money than maintaining the status quo. However over time the savings on every transaction amounted to more than the amount of money spent to transition from commodity based to fiat. The same is true, imo, with digital currencies like BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:13:20
I don't disagree with anything you wrote, none of it though implies that gold has intrinsic value. 
One could make similar arguments about the value of BTC since the number of bitcoins is fixed. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:23:40
Nothing has intrinsic value from my perspective. Which is not to say that things don't have value, just that we as individuals in a society determine the relative value of any "thing" or idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:20:17
 
Why would you sell something for less than it was "worth", the "worth" in this case being some value that is universal? You wouldn't I bet. 
Therefore, given that value is situationally defined, wrongly assuming that something has intrinsic value, which if it existed would necessarily be quantifiable, sets you up for over-valuing the actual commodity because you believe it has value. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:53:25
Your point is? 
And if I am, does that invalidate any of my statements?
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:52:18
you are using it in a sense that is anthropomorphic. Things that are not human/sentient/aware don't value anything as they are not capable of it. Does a rock value erosion or a lack of it? No, it is a rock. 
I am unfamiliar with Pirsig and the Zen of motorcycle maintenance.

Does everyone want to exist/live? If even one person doesn't want either of those things than the value is not universal and thus not intrinsic. 
This is just basic epistemology it dovetails, quite nicely, with the idea that Absolute truth does not exist. For intrinsic value to exist absolute truth also must exist. If an object has intrinsic value that value itself be an Absolute(universal) truth. Given there exists no evidence for universal truths, it follows that all value is socially defined.  
I don't disagree that land is valuable and that existence, as a general rule is a good thing, but that doesn't mean that it has intrinsic value. 
edit - just to be nitpicky how would you define food and would you say that all food has equal value?

Not disputing that but the desire for conductive materials and ornaments are not universal.

Um if you think that Sodium ions value Chlorine ions you are making an anthropomorphism. Sodium doesn't "want" to be balanced. Entropy dictates that all systems tend towards their lowest ground energy, this is why Sodium and Chlorine exchange electrons, not because one wants to get rid of one and the other wants to gain one. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:11:25
If I were the first person to ever make this statement yes, you would be correct. However, given that value as social construct is commonly accepted amongst philosophers and economists you are wrong. 
I never argued that things don't have value, but that their value is dependent on the circumstances. This is vitally important for appropriately valuing things. If you believe something has an intrinsic value you set an artificial floor below which the cost/price of the good cannot fall. This is a market distortion and is inefficient. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:20:37
Utility is not objectively defined, ask any economist, this is why economists deal with "wants" and not "needs". Utility cannot be generalized, it is highly subjective. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:19:32
True, people like nice things, however human definitions of what is "nice looking" change over time. Hence, all value is socially defined and thus not intrinsic. This isn't controversial, this is basic philosophy. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:53:50
although after a quick google I will have to read his works, I very much enjoy thinking about "value". 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:01:17
As far as your wikipedia source goes, "the social process of exchange as such being assumed to occur as a naturally given fact." It says exactly what I am saying, value is socially defined. Use value is defined socially and is thus not intrinsic. 
Understand that I am not arguing that value does not exist, or that there are not distinct differences in quality or qualia between objects. What I am arguing is that all of those distinctions are socially constructed and are not intrinsic to the object being evaluated. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:06:52
Objective truths are true from all frames of reference. 
Values are not universal, they differ from person to person and culture to culture. 
You, and most westerners value utility. That value is taught, it is not intrinsic. 
The point of reference, for utility as a "good", is the perspective of a consumer or producer. That reference point is what is constraining your perception that goods/services can have an intrinsic value as determined by their utility. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:26:43
I never said that it was, price floors are also not always defined by $. A price floor is just an abstraction on the concept of exchange. You can have price floors in sexual relations just like you can in market relations.

It is likewise why I have found philosophy more interesting than economics. 
I enjoyed our discussion, I hope you don't feel like I was being intentionally obtuse as that was not my intent.

bacteria value nothing because bacteria do not have the the neural circuitry to value anything. 
there is a biological value to water/nutrients, but there is no intrinsic value to biology as a whole.  Thus there is no intrinsic value to calories and nutrients which can be found in food. Food is itself just an abstraction, what is food to me is different than what is food to someone else or to another species. 
This is not to say that food isn't useful/necessary for humans, it just doesn't have value. Nothing has value that we don't ascribe to it.

The social construct that "stuff" is worth having is itself a subjective statement. 
For something to be inherently valueable it must be valueable to all people at all times, else its value is socially determined and therefore not intrinsic. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:43:01
I think its extremely relevant. If neither have intrinsic value why are we applying value to them in the first place?
If that question doesn't get asked it seems to me that the likelihood of misvaluing something is higher. 
An excellent example of this can be found in the gold-standard Ron Paul troops who think that gold has intrinsic value and thus should be the basis of currency. 
IMO it is only when you accept that no currency has intrinsic value that you can, philosophically, get to the place where you understand that a currencies primary goal is to facilitate transactions and that that ability to facilitate is not related to the currencies actual value. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:08:29
Reality/value as social construction is one of my favorite things to talk/debate about.

You responded to my comment about how all value is subjectively defined and that value is not intrinsic. 
I get what you are trying to explain, you don't seem to get what I am trying to explain. Else why did you respond to me in the first place 
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:53:14
That's the point, and it's not my definition. Value as human abstraction is commonly accepted in philosophy. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:37:57
Intrinsic value has to be quantifiable, not all value. 
If something isn't quantifiable, than it isn't universal, if it isn't universal it isn't intrinsic.  Which is the point of the statement that all value is situationally defined. 
Your "value" of your SO is defined by you, its not intrinsic to her or you. I imagine some days you like her/him more and some days like him/her less.

I don't understand this comment, I am pretty sure I understand your other comments. 
You are making the normative statement that utility is a "good" from all points of reference(a requirement for something to be considered intrinsic). I am responding to that claim. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:12:38
You are forgetting to account for the cost of producing the cash, holding the cash, distributing the cash, and ensuring that the cash is not counter-fitted. Those costs are vastly larger than the costs for BTC. 
Also, for you as an end user the transactional cost of any currency is almost identical, because the unit differences at the individual level are small. At the societal/global level however the differences are stark.
