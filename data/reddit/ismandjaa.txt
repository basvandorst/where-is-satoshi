Sorry to burst your bubble but this is simply not true. At least not in Europe. I have been following Bitcoin in the large european capital where I live, since 2014 and since then very few new businesses are starting to accept it. it's almost not changed since then. it's been 4 years! I check coinmap once a year to check in, but it's super depressing. Bitcoin has evolved a lot since then, but not POS-wise. the price may have 20x'ed but the POS-usability has not. not even close.

The fee is voluntary, however if you want a fast transaction the fee is highly encouraged. Pretty sure it takes a couple days for the transaction to go through if you don’t pay the fee. Some wallet software doesn’t even give you the choice not to pay the fee.

If you do not release your private key database, in the event you disappeared, would people not be able to get their coins back? also, what happens if you were to loose your private key DB?

With bitcoin you can: Send money from your computer, tablet, smart phone or other device, to anyone, anywhere in the world, day or night. Bitcoin is open-source, nobody owns it. Bitcoin is cryptographically secure, and cannot be artificially created, only 21 million “coins” will ever exist. Bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places. Bitcoin is free to transact and use with a small voluntary fee for faster transactions. Bitcoins are created and distributed fairly by the decentralized community that voluntarily supplies the network with computing power. Bitcoin is a better, faster, easier, decentralized, digital money.

The artist behind the store, and the clothing they sell doesn’t matter.. (is this sub dedicated to music and fashion all of a sudden?) What is important is how Shopify has integrated bitcoin into their payment platform.  Are there any notable shops that use Shopify but have not enabled the bitcoin feature? I think those shops are the ones we should be most interested in.

To my understanding the fee serves two purposes:
1. to create incentive for miners to keep mining even after all bitcoins have been mined (fees will become miners main incentive)
2. to prevent flooding 
You can transact for free if you wish, but your transaction might take a while because nodes will only relay so many free transactions. There is a set cap of 15000 bytes per minute for free transactions(to prevent flooding)
You can flood the system but you would fill up the free transactions quickly and then it would start getting expensive as you would have to pay the fee for all other transactions.

... Gotta love autocorrect
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:44:26
Haha, not important though! Being mentioned amongst these more known platforms gives bitcoin immense legitimacy to the public. That is what matters.

Just don't go with a fiat!
@_date: 2019-12-07 18:27:51
ah yes, because high net-worth individuals mostly keep their worth in fiat, and are therefore incentivized to spend it because of inflation to keep the economy going?

Pretty sure GPU miners would be softer than piles of gold coins and he doesn't seem to have a problem diving into those.

Yeeaa, "37% increase" might sound great, until you find out that 5 of these "new" locations are simply duplicates of places that have already been accepting bitcoin for a while. I have been keeping an eye on Coinmap in Copenhagen for some time, and have visited almost all places that accept bitcoin there. Looks like 5 new shops accept bitcoin in Copenhagen most of these are bars.. Pretty sure Coinify have been getting those started by giving them tablets to accept the currency. At least that seemed to be the case when I visited “The Dubliner” that had not yet “received their tablet from the bitcoin company”. So.. The actual increase in shops in Copenhagen is 5 (14.3%). Not quite as "dramatic".
To the people over at “version2” could you at least check the website you are writing about and not just blurt out random clickbait headlines? Thx.
Oh and also to anyone who might go to Copenhagen or live there already I wholeheartedly recommend visiting “Sankt Peders Café” it’s a great café with reasonable prices and great food, very cozy place. They do not use a payment processor for bitcoin purchases so it is just a raw bitcoin transaction ;)
