I wish they had started a separate pool for BTC futures.  Limping with traditional commodities with established price pressures may disrupt things. 
However, simply because it invites institutional money means we will likely see another surge in valuation. 
I am more concerned about that bill that makes it illegal to not disclose BTC to the government. I think coinbase, Gemini, kraken, etc need to engage the government on a better way to integrate this new financial industry.

Hell no. It is good. It is greater than 12 ....

Rebuttal: it has value (power to mine). It is not just a currency - it is a new, disruptive technology that doubles as a store of value. Unlike fiat, it has limited supply. It is a social movement and a massive transition of wealth. 
It has multiple levels of services to support it (exchanges, storage, atm’s, stores, etc). It is it’s own industry now.

I think B2X will go the way of other hard forks. I think this fork is ‘political’   Something that should not be occurring. 
BTC will remain King. I would not worry about it much.

Have they even processed bitcash yet?
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:28:23
Yes. If you are a windows user. Get chrome and the trezor app for chrome. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:06:39
I image it will retrace to $6000.00 to $6200.00 USD. 
BTC will be just fine ....

It depends. What I am about to say is not advice. I am not a lawyer, CPA, etc. you should check with a professional if you move forward with any idea. 
1. You treat BTC as a personal investment. You will pay the approximate 30% capital gains tax. Period. You should not endeavor to evade, etc. 
2. If your bitcoin holdings continue to increase, consider using them as an asset to create a LLC in a crypto currency friendly state like Nevada. Run everything through the LLC. This includes how you reinvest proceeds into ‘real’ assets like precious metals, real estate, etc. 
Bonus for having a business entity is there are significant tax advantages. Businesses pay taxes AFTER expenses. People do not. We pay taxes and then take out expenses. 
Just a thought.

Never too late. Less than 3% adaptation by investors.  I figure it will hit 3% around Feb 2018. Then hang on for the ride of your life. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:33:43
I don’t want to guess. I have the feeling the BTC ride will get interesting Q2 next year when institutional money significantly flows into BTC. Fun times!
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:29:15
We are considered pre-adaptation users. Sometime in Q1, the percent of investors should hit the 3% mark. That is when real institutional money will enter BTC and alt-coins. Then it will rocket .... IMO of course.  The ride from 3 to 10% is going to be crazy fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:14:24
Also consider the floodgates and mainstream status are quickly approaching. 
More and more money is flowing into crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:34:48
Crypto is not just currency. It is a new technology.. block chain. Not many people know or understand this disruptive tech and how it can be a catalyst for change. Think about the internet potential before anybody knew what it was. Or cell phones. 
We are early adapters to a new technology. 
It will take off around 3% adaption. It will become mainstream in society.

You should consult with a tax or corporate attorney. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:55:02
There are companies that let you loan BTC and you get a return. Many of them mine and use loans (or ICO’s) as a way to raise capital. Be VERY careful. 
I use one ... but you need to do your due diligence. It is the Wild West out there and almost all start up companies fail in the first few years. Many say these operations are scams. I would venture some are .. I would assume most simply fail. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:15:44
Always, always pay your taxes.

Why not join a mining group and avoid capital expenditure on equipment?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:17
That is what I use. ����
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:19:45
Stability after a surge is good. Limiting factor is support industries. Exchanges need to hire and train more people to process applications.  Same with banks handling wire transfers, etc. 
This is good for when the REAL price rocket takes off when we hit the 3% adaptation point. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:03:51
Yes. Paper or personal vault.

BTC rose so fast, the support systems and personnel were caught off guard.  The exchanges, banks, etc need to hire new people, develop bandwidth, etc to handle the increase in trade volume, transfers, inquiries, process accounts, etc.
I think BTC will go sideways for a couple of weeks. maybe to the November fork, then take off again.
IMO of course.  We are still below the 3% investor adaptor volumes.  When it hits 3% ... it will become a staple of cable news business information.  They will report BTC price like they do S&amp;P, USD, Interest rates and what not.  Then it will surge to 10%+ and when that happens .... HOLD ON.

1. Register with an exchange.  Examples: Coinbase. Gemini. Kraken.
2. Buy a personal vault.  I use a Trezor.
3. Do not store, long-term, on a website or 'hot' wallet.
3. Use that BTC to earn more BTC.  How?  That is up to you and your risk tolerance. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:58:03
I do not think you can really compare gold to bitcoin. Gold, today and the future, is not used in daily transactions. Bitcoin will be more widespread. Compare bitcoin to emerging tech like cell phones. 
As bitcoin is adopted by main stream populations, they will be buying fractional amounts.  I would guess we are innovator to early adaptation buyers.

Also consider:
1. 2.5% charge for use of a CC.
2. Limited $$ amount for first time transfer.
3. Fraud prevention measures by banks.
4. First time ACH will take 7 to 11 days due to volume.
5. I prefer Gemini.  I also have a Kraken acct.
IMO, I think the sideways movement is due to the industry needing to adjust to the increase in interest.  Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase, etc have to hire a ton of people to process the new accounts, answer questions, and what not.  I imagine BTC will take off again after the next fork ... after the supporting industries are caught up and have improved their systems.
