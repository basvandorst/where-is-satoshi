He bought it from a big centralized exchange and then moved it to his personal wallet.
They claim he "Sold" the bitcoins..

This is a worse  case. he didn't sold, he is not even hodling..
And they still bother him with taxes

Problem is, if he is "forced" to use a leech lawyer to fix this issue and end up paying so much money for legal shit.. he not only lost the Bitcoins but paying a penalty for it.. this is madness.  
This is why people want to use Zcoin, Monero.. decentralized exchanges and lose all contacts with gov entities.
They could consider bitcoin as a currency like Germany and other countries.. but no.. they want to leech the simple citizens..

But he did moved to alts many times back and forth (like most of crypto users) 2 years ago and 1 year ago..

Why would I go to legaladvice? few of them that understand crypto and majority of them will tell me to spend money on lawyers and CPAs..

Mobile wallet not Trezor or something, it went down while surfing

After he bought bitcoins (2 years ago) he played with it, moved from one place to another, tried alts etc, some exchanges even died (less known ones) then he gave up and bought back bitcoin and lost key..
That's the problem, now they want info and he have almost none.. he said he can find like 30% of the transactions, but that's about it.. he had no idea 2 years ago that he needed to record all exchanges, there was no such law back then..

Pretty much

I am looking for people that had similar issues, with similar experience.
I am trying to understand how it make sense that people getting asked to pay taxes for a currency even if they don't even own them any more.
