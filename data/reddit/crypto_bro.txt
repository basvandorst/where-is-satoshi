Thanks you too!

As the creator of Block and Jerry's I can confirm. We had a great time utilizing the Lightning Network and experimenting before the main net LND beta. However, we all got jobs and doing ice cream delivery was too much to keep up with :)

True, but this implementation was mostly focused on Bitcoin/Litecoin
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:52:58
Literally invested man, read up. Why would someone put money in and then say yeah, I hope ethereum will be the internet's native currency?
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:51:02
All I am saying is that this being "news" is ridiculous... obviously he hopes that the internet's currency will be Bitcoin based on where he put his money. That is all.

As an investor in the Lightning Network (Lightning Labs), what did y'all expect him to say? :)

Looks like a left monkey hammer camelhump candle to the right.

Time to plug in the old 1.4 th/s at the expense of my parent's electricity bill 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:42:17
Awesome thanks!

Thanks for the idea. We also provide USD for easy conversion. I've seen sites use mBTC. You think that makes sense?
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:51:25
Awesome, good idea... making changes today before we go live tomorrow.

I have never used AWS, only heard this recommendation from a friend. Would this be an easy setup?
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:29:38
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:28:54
Do they measure by node or by hash power?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:54:05
Couldn't agree more.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:03:56
At first my reaction was, who the hell took the time to make this... but high key this is gold LOL
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:30:49
Lol this gets 112 upvotes, I post a question about how to run a full node and someone shits on me...
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:04:37
Coinbase &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:05:34
Very true, this was, in a sense, a more rhetorical comment. Clearly we are not yet at a time when bitcoin is the default reference of value, however for some here on Reddit who are a little more into this Bitcoin thing, that may already be the case :)

Node life
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:31:04
Wow those are great!
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:46:08
I want a voice in the system and want to try to get a solid understanding of how everything works.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:00:15
All these people comprehending Bitcoin's value through the eyes of fiat are still behind the times.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:31:39
Yeah I got a shit computer and its taking literal days on the internet WIFI I am using.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:27:59
Is it plausible to run a node on AWS?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:26:30
My number one bookmark now :)
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:14:49
I just got in on the CryptoCompare Beta. It looks great so far... but I guess I am only one of few so Coinbase I probably good for the masses.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:01:42
I heart Woz
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:15:40
Yeah I actually haven't found that either. Can't imagine they will leave that out of the final version though.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:14:28
Why I'd want to run a full node?
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:30:33
I am not quite the bitcoin maximalist that you are, but I do agree that blockchain is not intended for storing data -- instead it should be IMO minimalist distributed db serving as a public ledger. However, other blockchain projects are using bitcoin concepts in interesting ways, ways that make sense. I agree bitcoin is a great use of blockchain, but not the ONLY use of DLT.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:31:10
Mentioning ice cream on the blockchain woah eyyyyy we out here
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:05:04
Blockchain was never created for speed... nowhere in the whitepaper does it say Satoshi proposed Bitcoin as the fastest payment ledger tech of all time
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:31:46
Again as I said SATOSHI, not nasdaq,
