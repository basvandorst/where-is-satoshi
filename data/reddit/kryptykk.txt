Bingo. This is key
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:52:31
Eh, even if it drops to $50 BTC, I only lost $100. Like I said, I considered the money spent as soon as it was gone, so I'm not going to get upset. Rule  of risky investing
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:28:43
Anyone recommend a good replacement? I loved using BitFloor, so I will need to find a new service 
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:58:28
Sounds good to me, signed up at CoinBase
@_date: 2013-06-18 14:14:12
I am waiting for the verification deposits in my account. Once that happens, is it the standard 2-3 business days to transfer to Coin Base?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:35
So glad I found out about LocalTill. Money is waiting for me by the time I walk home from the bank 
@_date: 2013-06-18 14:07:07
Oh sweet, so I can just swap with you? My money should clear on Thursday, so I will hit you up. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:44:23
Damn! Makes my measly 1 BTC stack look measly in comparison. Cheers to your gains :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:30:23
Yeah, purchased some more (.5) before it dropped, but in it for awhile so not too big of a deal
@_date: 2013-06-18 13:13:09
Yeah I have an account there, but I'm still on that damn 30 day wait period. I have sent them multiple emails, but no responses...
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:36:26
Prices fluctuate wildly. BitFloor has been as low as $140 and as high as $190 in the past 5 minutes. It will level off by this time tomorrow, I'm guessing somewhere around where it was last night ~$220
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:30:57
Hey, so did I, but hold strong. It will return! I only purchased .7 (~$150), so even if I lose it all I won't be that mad
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:13:07
Additional. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:52:27
Yup, I'm not too worried about it. Will ride the wave and see where it takes me 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:34:25


That is the only mindset you can have when dealing with a market as volatile as this. Enjoy the ride. If you make some money, you make some money and if you don't you don't. Just don't be stupid and don't put more money on there than you can afford, expecting a payout. 
I bought .7 @ ~$240 this morning, but I am in it for the long haul so I am not too worried. 
Me right now:

Believe me, I know. This is a little fun on the side. I have a steady job that I contribute into my Deferred Compensation as well as a Roth IRA, and I'm up 10% on the year. Like I said, I'm just having some fun and I considered the money 'spent' as soon as I purchased some BTCs
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:19:35
'even' is relative to what we have been experiencing the past 2 weeks
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:40
Me too man! I bought a 1/4 just a week and a half ago for $90 (1.5 BTC). If I sat on it and cashed out at $250 today, I'd have had enough money to do this:  , except with a different white powder
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:16:58
I also have money on hold, but limit order not showing up..
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:12:34
I've been doing the same, it's fun!
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:18:44
Thank you for that! I kept seeing it and couldn't figure out how to tip, now I will be up and running shortly :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:27
High risk == gambling, so yes, I would consider it a gamble. That is why I am not putting my life savings on it. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:34:11
Yes, finally. My money appeared in my account this morning. I will be looking at alternatives for the future.. I think Coinbase will be my go-to
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:38:17

@_date: 2013-04-10 19:37:12
You're crazy if you think all currencies don't start out like this. It will eventually stabilize. I didn't say that big business should start accepting it as payment now, only that resilience is key 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:58
Yeah but it also takes an hour or so for the transfer from wallet to wallet, and in that meantime the prices could decrease(Bitcoin)/increase(USD)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:21
Bought at $250 earlier, upset I didn't wait but hey thats how the game is played. Not selling in the short-term anyways 
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:56:06
BitFloor is back up, trading at $202
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:09:26
Congratulations! That is just incredible

I am having problems transferring money FROM Dwolla TO CampBX. Initiated a transfer on 7/24 and Dwolla has that marked as sent, but I still have not received anything in my CampBX account after 5 full days...
