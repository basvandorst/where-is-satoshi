I have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:10:32
Those neurotypicals have no business being in bitcoin.

Join a labor union, have them negotiate for you?

Lawful taxation by the government is perfectly justified by the social contract that serves as the basis of the society. If you don't like it, feel free to leave.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:37:30
Nobody deserves but here we are anyway.

lol they were right

What's this FUD, he already said that the LN rollout iterative learning point organic process will distributedly never finish, what more could you want? Geez some people are never happy.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:27:58
and what a sweet gig it is too. getting paid top doge to spread nefarious FUD on reddit from the comfort of my home. also occasional deals on cheap explosives
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:12:59
Lol, 3 * "number go down if I squint right" is now "statistically pretty good"
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:13:31
(that was the idea all along)
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:48:38


They will have to pay the opening and closing fees though, that'll teach them right quick.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:49:02
The police should be after tax evaders and other thieves, it's only fair.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:58:21
Reddit accounts are free, you should change them regularly.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:19
Not paying something you owe, like taxes, is morally equivalent to theft. It's pretty simple.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:23:16


No, since the vast majority of your wealth should be in tangible property, real estate, stocks etc. which will go up in nominal value along with the inflation, thus keeping the real value more or less constant.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:25:29
Yeah lol @ all those stupid adults!
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:09:12
That'll show them!

Nothing in life is risk-free, not even investments.

Coworkers? I'm pretty sure "Becky" and "John" are code for mom and dad.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:52:12


Which is required for both net saving and net spending.
@_date: 2018-01-01 19:13:23
Can you use LN in your daily transactions? If the answer's no then it's still little better than vaporware.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:42:27
Not paying taxes is theft and it gets you locked up?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:00:36


TBH this is why everyone here is buying bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:25:38
Yeah, just use actualmoney and skip the bitcoin step. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:07:18
Like many cryptocurrency fans, OP is economically illiterate.

It's not supposed to be an argument you dummy
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:03:56


The latter one, obviously.


Why do you think that the "traditional" payment processors are somehow frozen in time? They are constantly updating their technology too. It's a constant race.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:02:39


lol, currency of the future
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:39:50
Trying the ignorance gambit, eh?
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:21:45
Probably all the bitcoin-related scams are causing a lot of chargebacks and investigations which are costing them money, so they'll just boot out all bitcoin customers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:19:16
tl; dr:   We're not investors, we're a cult.

You do have thermos and the high priesthood of core devs...
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:46
No they're collector's items
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:14
Oh good more internet points
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:14:35
A functional lightning network capable of handling actual bitcoin transactions efficiently does not exist yet. Indeed it may never exist. Your assumptions about its efficiency are solely based on puff pieces, propaganda and fantasy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:20:10
I cannot make that call because sufficient information is not available yet. For the exact same reason claiming that LN will solve bitcoin's problems is beyond silly.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:21:22


Lol, how do you think taxes work in general?
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:55:51


It's a codename for Roger Ver
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:03:24


Any, really.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:11:07
Normal income tax applies, then, and you end up paying more.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:48:14
The 0.01% fee per hop in your simulation is a completely arbitrarily chosen parameter, and misleadingly low at that. Why did you think it important enough to include in the title?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:52:10
They would get the channel opening and closing fees.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:14:07


You can, but why would you? Nobody owes anything to bitcoin hoarders.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:45
Actually it's getting a little better. The conspiracy theories and 'professional economists and computer scientists are so stupid' memes were always upvoted here, but now at least some sane replies also get upvotes. I'm guessing it's because the recent influx of interested people is slowly diluting the original pool of libertarians.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:53:28
To anyone not heavily invested in bitcoin (the vast majority of people) it's a really strong incentive against adopting the new currency.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:42:58
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:48:07
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:31:06
Why not done?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:12:09
The transaction rate is now less than it was 8 years ago. Less.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:56:20
Yet for some strange reason we never get to see the actual LN, it's always safely 18 months away.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:12:21
In the US at least it seems it does.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:08:47
Let's interview your friend and see if the stories match.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:47:41
I bet I haven't even read the White Paper!
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:41
In the off chance that LN works well, credit card companies could simply adopt it and issue USD-based tokens that can be exchanged via LN-style channels. Like Tethers, but actually redeemable, regulated and safe, and with minimal channel opening and closing fees. Bitcoin has no future.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:14:05
3 transactions per second, or one transaction per person per 60 years or so worldwide, better plan ahead to make the best use of that transaction!
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:07:48
This, except the free step isn't free either.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:03:19
Rusty claimed the fees will be "pretty token", surely he could not have been talking out of his ass!
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:33:51
Being your own bank with that kind of attitude won't net you many customers!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:15
That's capitalism
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:13:00
Debit card fees (which are the reasonable comparison) are not that high. In the EU, for example, debit card interchange fee (the majority component of the total merchant fee) is capped at 0.2% of the transaction value.

He certainly didn't inherit anything.

Nothing *has* come out of it, except for a huge bubble that will wreck thousands of lives when it collapses.

The people on the yacht are an entirely different couple (they either sell miners or own an exchange)
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:16:35
It never was. It's a purely speculative bubble with nothing of real economic value behind it. Most of the people "investing" in it will lose their money to pay for the profits of the lucky few.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:33:40
Why? The return rate is about the same.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:09
No it's actually Soros and the Rigelian snake-people
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:06:31
Very convenient, almost as good as buying a $100 stack of Starbucks gift cards!
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:49:35
No, because I'm not a degenerate gambler.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:40:53


I thought this was the point of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:02:31
Screw that noise, what about dogecoin?
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:21:26
Had. Now he has a Tesla.
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:52:04
You must be mistaken, I've been told countless times here that I should be my own bank.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:29:57
Thanks, crazy person, for keeping known_banksters_reptilians_and_other_enemies_of_bitcoin.txt up to date!
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:01:57
Yes, once we change everything that bitcoin is it may one day become usable.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:21:34
Useless since you cannot review the actual firmware running on your device.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:09:22
