It's a Canadian accounting firm.

All their data was encrypted. They paid a lump sum of 500BTC for the hackers to decrypt it.

My mother's company bought 500BTC because of ransomware earlier in 2017. I hear there wasn't any leftovers...

Figured. That's where I bought from. Thanks

When you're old and dying, you'll be happy; I'm sure of it. You're making the right choice here. :)

People look at the price of one BTC.. say to themselves that it's too expensive, then don't look into any further. It needs to he made clear that BTC is divisible the moment anyone hears about it. Whether this is the way to do it, I don't know, but it's a necessary step to make in the furthering the adoption of bitcoin.

They won't even get to the research part if they think they can't afford it anyway.

It's not too late is it? This seems to suggest that you guys think it will grow alot in the next 10 years. What if I bought 2k in bitcoin today? Might other crypto currencies increase more percentage wise being that bitcoin is already so expensive? Sure it's impossible to know, but I'd like the input of those in the cryptosphere before I invest.

Yeah I was having a lot of trouble earlier, but I think it's going to work out now after I watched just 1 video. Thanks

I have mine on bitpay app for Android. Is it generally considered to be good?

Indeed, it really should be standardized globally.

While true, telling someone that they have a 0.0000000001% chance of getting the correct permutation over the period of 10 lifetimes isn't useful to anyone.
