I was a few commands away from mining the shit on a gaming rig in 2009. I decided it was too complicated when I ran into problems early on with my graphics card. So fucking close. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:03:02
I dunno, the stuff I see from is usually so much worse. Their entire purpose seems to be to shit on this sub and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:05:59
Yeah posts like this is why people think bitcoin supporters are blind fools. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:26:42
This is dumb and not even close to true. Also I'm not sure a Russian puppet is who we want to brag about endorsing bitcoin.

Thank you for a legitimate reason. I agree, something like zib would be better, and we definitely need to get rid of the milli/m/micro/mu/whateverthefuckthissymbolis stuff.

is very anti-bank, and people usually post just about anything that makes banks look bad, or anything that is bad news to banks. For some reason a lot of people here think that banks should be something they focus on bashing if they want bitcoin to grow.

I love the idea of including Bitcoin in minecraft, but I don't feel like this will keep most people's interest for long. For those that don't play Minecraft, emeralds are the rarest ore you can find. At 1 bit per emerald, it'd be like a second job trying to get even $1 worth of bitcoins a day out of it. 
But it might still work great at getting people, especially younger people, interested in bitcoin. Which is all that really matters in this project I guess.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:36:07
I don't even buy tires online with USD... But I wish you the best of luck. Accepting bitcoin even if no one uses it is still good. Spreads the word, awareness, and you're prepared for when more people use it for purchases. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 17:09:29
I think you'll need more than a nice new website to get any love out of the bitcoin community.

And you know at least a couple of those other guys hit thumbs up on accident and didn't notice.

Someone explain to me why anyone would bid or tip selfies? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:02:09
That was completely different than what is being implied by the title. That was assets taken from a criminal bust. The title implies the NSA stealing coins straight from cold storage wallets of normal citizens through the use of tapped USB cords.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:29:05
They were never there.

I remember in 2009 being convinced that bitcoin was a bad joke. If only I hadn't listened to people and done my own research.

I'd like to know how viable this is anymore. What are his profits per week/month, how long did it take for it to become profitable, etc.

I always wonder how people think the world would function without government. I see something like Somalia, with more random flames coming out of the ground.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:13:37
You're taking this way too seriously. They asked and he gave a number, that's it. You think he should put everything in bit coin because of that? Are you kidding? 
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:40:52
I don't think this is going to be a problem, at all. For the tiny amount of cables that might have these, to begin with. And second, why would you assume that the NSA would use this ability to steal bitcoin from a cold storage wallet? I mean, they've already got enough hate, they aren't going to go stealing money from citizens.

Not the overly complicated system I was talking about. That's the "default", without any kind of system to change how we say it.

It's still defacing/vandalizing, it doesn't matter what it's for.

As others have said, gold and silver only have their value due to current scarcity. They aren't really that rare, we just haven't mined a ton of it yet. Someone could discover a massive gold mine and the prices could drop greatly. Eventually we'll be mining asteroids and meteors and we'll have more than we know what to do with. With bitcoin, there will never be more than a specific amount. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:52:29
Hopefully with. If they're lobbying/bribing in a good way, it could be great for bitcoin. If the opposite, people will panic, but longterm no one will care, because we don't need mastercard, or any of their kind.
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:15:00
How exactly is it a scam coin? Where do you see the scam in this? Do you just call all non-bitcoin coins "scam coins"? If you'd read the entire article you'd understand why they were included in the project.
@_date: 2014-05-03 14:15:29
Look at this guy's username.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:42:20
I've yet to see anyone give a reasonable excuse as to why "bits" is a bad idea but using that over complicated system we currently use is a good idea.
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:42:05
I really hope you're right, and what you say does make sense. With companies like Dish allowing bitcoin, maybe we're already there?
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:15:34
I'm extremely interested in this. However, what will give safecoins value? I see how it will be distributed, and I like it, but what makes them valuable?
@_date: 2014-06-04 02:43:46
Thanks for all the replies. I feel more confident now, and appreciate the ELI5-level responses.

Why is all this stuff that has nothing to do with bitcoin getting posted and upvoted so much? This isn't or or some shit.

When it comes to WoW references, people take the tiniest thing and stretch it as far as they can until there's a tiny resemblance of a reference. Just go to somewhere like wowhead (if that's still a thing), find a random object or item, and someone probably has some kind of reference that barely even fits for it.

Some people have health limitations. Some places have weather limitations. Some jobs require you to show up not smelling like sweat or needing a shower. You're assuming *a lot*.
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:36:48
Not sure giving people such a tiny amount of money is going to get anyone interested anyway. 100 bits isn't worth figuring it all out.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:27:13
Is the article even worth reading? I've heard this said so many times now about bitcoin, dogecoin, every altcoin ever made. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:52:45
Do we have to wait until they've mined a block to be able to safely move bitcoin and acquire BCH in our wallets?
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:19:56
Every single coin sub and forun is so filled with obvious agenda pushers that I don't trust a single one if them. So many scummy shit heads trying to pump their own coin and acting like a fucking cultist, how is anyone supposed to get good information?

Nice job pumping your alt coin in here. Wonder who wasted all that gold trying to pump price for profit. Tell me how bitcoin cash won't have the same problems?

What if he'd been fast enough to move the coin before the drive failed, but cloning it caused it to fail before he even has a chance? Is that possible? Does cloning not run it a lot more and harder than normal use? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:12:12
Right, but the casually interested investor might not have the time to knowledge to understand the technology without a lot of reading, time, and effort. It's a shame that so many people are just in the tech for profit and are sleazy and slimy enough to constantly lie/exaggerate to try to manipulate prices for profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:25:31
Yes. It's worth is speculation at this point, but money is money, the moment you sell it for usd it doesn't matter what you can buy with bitcoin, you have usd now.
And you can buy a lot with bitcoin.

Is that just the default thing you say so you don't need to have a real opinion?

It's not okay to just release certain info to push an agenda. You can't sit back and say that's a good thing. They don't give a shit about transparency, they want to sell you a story. Not the whole story, which is what you *should* want.
Can't believe all the idiots supporting this tool as if he is some hero for transparency.

He's not lost money until he's sold it either.

I like bitcoin as much as the next guy but it's not a responsible way to invest a six year old's 600 dollars. That's a lot of money for a six year old that could go towards a good safe investment for when she's 18. Not a super risky one just because she heard her dad talking about it. This is irresponsible.

Maybe I'm missing something but I doubt it. It doesn't seem to be quite there yet. I think it'll settle higher than before,and the next bubble will likely be the "big push" and more wider acception.

It's hilarious that you keep saying this like it's some kind of proof or evidence.
