I agree. I feel like mining will happen but at a reduced ROI(for a short period of time) to regain losses. That assumes that the site dose make a full recovery (I have faith in admin but have lost bitcoin to scams or businesses going bankrupt in the past). We will just have to wait and see how it plays out.

New Update: "Tomorrow (June 30, 2015) at 09:00 (Brasilia) All users will be prompted to change usernames, PINs and passwords. The system will remain in lockdown until July 1, 2015 09:00, at this time the lockdown will be lifted and trading, withdrawing, depositing and mining will resume. We apologize for missing our ETA date, the audit took longer then expected."

Accounts are online again but trading and withdraws are not. This is a good sign as many of the scams (I have been the victim of some) say they got "Hacked" and don't do any work or even give updates on the work they have done. So far this has given me more confidence and while I can't guarantee their return I have been there for a while and trust that admin is telling the truth.

Here is the latest news posted by Admin: "June 24, 2015 - Today the hackers came back in and cleaned our databases taking our chat room with it.
This doesn't effect us at all since we have many images of the database before the attack. We'll be up and running on a clean and safe server by tomorrow. Once we're on the new server, we'll rollback everyone's KHS/BTC balances prior to the attack and you will be able to login once again.
Our ETA stands at June 30th if everything runs smoothly, once we "relaunch" all user balances will be available for withdraw.
Current mining rewards are being used to recover some of the losses.
We will update once we're on the new server, Take care!"

The latest information released by admin "Deposits and withdraws are now functioning.
Withdraws are being handled manually for the time being, they could take up to 24 hours to be processed.
Everyone now has new deposit addresses, to view it visit the deposit page.
Do not deposit into your old address.
Rewards have been temporarily reduced until all losses are recovered."
This means mining is resuming as usual at a reduced reward rate until all losses have been recovered. I will continue with updates but for now many users have confirmed withdraws are working and I have personally had a deposit work. Deposits are slow and seem to be taking well over the 3 confirmations. As for withdraws they are processed manually so expect up to 24 hours before it is sent to your wallet.

Mining is once again online but at a reduced rate. As for Admin he was online today according to  this site has a record of any message he posts in chat. The reduced rate is only temporary as they recover losses so rewards are sitting at 20% of the normal rate and they should return to normal withing a week. This is a good start to the sites recovery but until it reaches the normal reward rate we can't know anything for sure.

At no point in time has Admin ever said he is mining LTC he has a script that runs to decide the most profitable coin to mine. We also don't know how large the losses were as we were never given a number. the price pump may not have even lasted long enough for the system to change and mine LTC as the script most likely only runs between 1 and 4 times a day (I don't work there and haven't seen any information but this is my best guess). I understand your frustration and I was hoping he would at least tell us why it has taken more than the 5 days he expected. As far as the chat goes it is very likely the new server is causing problems. I have done some programming and server work and setting up a new server can cause a lot of problems.

You can never be to safe. Personally I plan to invest more when I have the funds to do so. I never invest more than I am ready to lose and it is something I prepare myself for before making any kind of investment.

Hey kartalint I don't work for scrypt.cc I am just reporting on the information that is publicly available. One of my friends is having the same issue. He didn't have any BTC or KHS in his account at the time so they may have deleted it. My account is now working so I recommend trying yours again. For anyone interested in signing up for the site you are unable to currently register. I will let you know when they begin accepting new users again.

New users are being accepted. Sorry forgot to post letting people know. it has been working for about a week now.
