Wow. Lot's of things wrong here. First of all, that would get you ~15% return over a year, not a month. Second, leverage isn't free. You will certainly be paying a higher rate to borrow than treasuries pay out seeing as treasuries have the highest credit rating, while you YOLOing into your trading account does not. 
You will lose money on that trade.

It is quite international.  And internationally, no one thinks of Jönköping, Sweden as **the** Bay Area.  Furthermore, internationally, more people recognized the Bay Area over any of the morass of towns that make it up.  Any listing of his town would necessarily be followed with "located in the Bay Area".  Listing just the town would also likely be less accurate as his home town is probably only a small part of the area he works.

What domestic economy?  50% of their GDP is from oil exports.  Oil is in the toilet.  Their biggest trading partner by far is the United States.  So dropping so heavily against the dollar has a direct and significant impact on their buying power.  What's even worse, they have $6 billion dollars in bond payments due the in the next three months.  **Dollars**, not Bolivar's.  Uh-oh.
And it's not just dropping against the dollar, it's dropping against a basket of international currencies.  There is no way they are maintaining buying power.

Find me a bank paying 0.01%.  Give me a break.  And yeah, interest rates are low.  That is why you can get such a low interest rate for home loans.  If they are loaning money out for low interest rates, you get paid a low interest rate.  Where else do you think the money comes from?


Irrelevant.  If you hold it in cash you lose 100% of inflation.  With the bank you lose less.  That's positive NPV compared to holding cash yourself.  And you aren't even covering the investment options they provide which pay at or greater that 3%.

Maybe, but to put it into perspective.  The market cap of the S&amp;P 500 is 15 trillion.  There are 30 individual companies in the US alone that have a large market capitalization than 100 billion.
And that's just equities.  
Gold is a 20 trillion dollar market.  And then there are the big commodities like oil, corn, etc.  The world bond market is 82 trillion.
Would they notice it at 100 billion?  Yeah, I think they are noticing at 10 billion.  But I don't think either of those is enough for them to consider a critical part of their investment strategy.  When you have trillions to invest, a $100 billion dollar market can only absorb so much of your capital.

there are other potential discrepancies in your tax reporting

No, you have not realized any gains.
If you  buy a coin for $100, and buy a thing for $600, you  have $500 in realized gains.  Why?  Well you  bought my coin for $100 and exchanged it for a thing worth $600.  Since you  now own a thing worth $600 dollars, You've realized $500 in gains.
Now when you give a gift to someone, what have you gained?  You have $100 less than you started with and received nothing in return.  There is nothing to tax.

That's not 100%.  Presumably requests are reflective of a small percentage of the people that would actually use the service.  If they get 1000 requests, they may see that as a potential for 10,000 users.  If the number of requests are lower than the number of people that would use the service, that's pretty bad.

Selling your investment isn't hedging it.  That's just selling it.  You haven't maintained your position while reducing the risk with a companion investment.  You've just got rid of the risk entirely by getting rid of the investment.
The whole point is so you can keep your bitcoin position while retaining it's buying power at point of receipt.  Then you don't need to liquidate your bitcoin position, you can keep them and use them directly for business expenses.  Just liquidating all of your bitcoins immediately accomplished none of that.

**Financial instruments** are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership interest in an entity (share), or a contractual right to receive or deliver cash (bond).

You are comparing a brokerage to an exchange.  An experienced person such as yourself must know the difference?


Your own link clearly states that real time on demand quotes are free for trading.  What is NOT free is real-time quotes as applied to your portfolio value and real-time streaming quotes.


I have 15 years industry experience building real time trading systems, and exchange development.  Stocks, Futures, Options and OTC Swaps.


No.  Not saying it doesn't happen with lesser brokerages (much more rarely with the actual exchange, which is the more apt comparison) during heavy market conditions, but it is not considered normal, and it makes people very angry.  They would not tolerate this happening all day every day, at all.  
When this happened with the facebook IPO it was a HUGE blow to NASDAQ's reputation, as it should be.  When it happened to BATS, when they did an IPO on their exchange with their own stock it torpedoed the exchange completely.  Wrecked.


You are conflating real-time on demand quotes with real-time streaming quotes.  One is free, the other is not.  I'm not asking for sub-millisecond latency, but something reasonable for a click trade.


On Mt. Gox, *no one* can get real-time quotes for *any* price.  Even if you argue that Nasdaq and NYSE quotes aren't widely distributed enough, you must agree there is a large pool of actors who *do* have a reasonable view into the market.  With Mt. Gox., no one has this access for $10, $10,000, or $10 million.  It *does not exist* for *any* price.  You can have the exchange chugging along where absolutely no one knows what is going on in the matching engine.  
That's not at all normal for any exchange.  The fact that you have "experience trading on the stock market" and I don't?  Does not change this at all.  If you are going to apply a logical fallacy, at least do so correctly.

Regardless of your claim, you *can* get real time quotes.  Just the major indexes?  Let's say that's true.  With btc, you can't get real time quotes on the one major product they carry for any amount of money because it is lagged, not delayed.  And if free on google is not enough, last I checked an etrade account didn't require "serious coin".  There you can get everything real time because any body outside of the bitcoin world would be non-plussed at the idea of being asked to trade with real money against old market data.
