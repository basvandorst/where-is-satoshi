Yeah man. My bosses were like I heard about bitcoin. One of my bosses was giving me a look like see I told you it was all a ponzi.
Meanwhile I still cashed out a bit a month or so ago and still an up so I mean, at the end of the day it’s all good.

God damnit these guys need to stop  fucking with my ICX.We were on a roll til the FUD halted the moon mission momentum. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:41:42
I see good stuff thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:20:11
Right but how would they know? If you are paying your taxes every year then why would you be audited when there are hundreds of thousands who are currently NOT doing so?
If you just pay 15% every year, are they really going to audit you? You would seem legit as compared to other crypto investors.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:55:36
For sure thanks again for the info this really helps
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:47:00
Yeah that does thanks
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:30:30
I see. That is good to know.
But then we're back at square one, how will they know when and where you bought it? I seriously SERIOUSLY doubt they will have the manpower to look through hundreds to thousands of trades everyone has done on MULTIPLE exchanges and accounting for fluctuating USD and Satoshi values.
I mean somewhere in those pages is where I could have bought say a bunch of IOTA and then sold it for BTC then cashed out. 
I mean it's just going to be a huge clusterfuck. That's why I wonder if the IRS will just say ok thanks for paying up we'll take it. And in that case, just pay the 15% every time so you pay the least amount.

Uh, is that doctor shirtless? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:43:49
Now here’s the thing.
Let’s say I buy $10k of BTC, hodl, it becomes 20k and I sell and cash out. 
Ok cool 10K capital gains. But then I put 5K back in because omg it’s mooning 
So now is my cost basis 15K and my capital gains 5K?
@_date: 2018-09-01 01:26:48
Nice 
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:35:54

Technically it seems like you could cash out and pay long term capital gains tax (which is a lot less tax rate) 
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:09:54
So what you’re telling me is, we’re  gonna have another moon mission like BCC?
Get your shekels ready boys. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:04:28
Stop sounding like all rationale and shit. Bitcoin good. People say bad about bitcoin bad. Grunt.
