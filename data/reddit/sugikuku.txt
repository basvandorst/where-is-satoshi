are they using btc ?
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:33:36
Correct me if I'm wrong but your method doesn't seem to impose a minimum block size. We have the risk of a group of miners colluding and trying to keep the block size as small as possible to try to get us to pay huge fees for transactions. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:14:49
Transactions with zero fee are happening today and they are getting into the blocks. So the fact that you wouldn't add them is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:44:42
It wont be zero, but this has already been discussed. For a miner the cost to include a transaction is practically zero. Remember miners are in the business to make money, they do not care about your ideals or about blockchain bloat. They will take any transaction even its if for 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:41:41
You can also try a trustless way of mixing: 
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:23:12
The problem is what happens with an unlimited block size ?
There is no reason for people to pay fees or they will always pay the minimum amount.  
With 1MB limit people will be forced to pay high fees and move a lot of the transactions off chain.  
The problem is not so simple or it would've been solved by now.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:28:46
You shouldn't care. As long as we have the freedom to assign arbitrary value to whatever we choose, be it magic cards, stamps or internet tokens it will be legal.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:23:00
someone tell them to fix the zero-cash link
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:44:30
the supply of new bitcoins is fixed regardless of the number of miners/hash power.
@_date: 2014-12-31 11:27:13
they aren't. All you see is just good marketing and inflated numbers
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:24:33
Don't use gentoo or at least luke-jr's version
Don't use eligius.st either so you wont fund his operations
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:24:59
The language has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol. We currently have implementations in a wide array of languages.
But if you're keen to learn a language I would go with python
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:29:08
This should be easy. There are only 
1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 possible guesses.
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:22:17
I don't see the use of vanitygen in this scenario. You could just generate a random address.
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:53:17
It is a big unsettling that most crowd funded projects had failed to deliver so far but hopefully we will see at least one of this take of: ethereum, storj, openbazaar

Because they are PUBLIC keys and there are other ways to connect the addresses to your wallet.  
If someone can access your computer you've got bigger things to worry about than someone getting your public keys.  
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:50:33
And what is this bot supposed to do ?
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:06:27
If one has access to your computer he's able to sniff all your passwords so in this case yeah, passwords are useless.

"P.Krugman's blog, that Bitcoin's function as a store of value conflicts with its function as means of exchange."  
So gold failed as well ?

Make sure you don't store your coins on a 3rd party site for the long term. Get a local wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-11 09:44:32
Thats true and thats how I initially started, however the fact that coinmarketcap is behind cloudflare would cause some failures due to their anti ddos protection.
Not sure what malicious stuff could the 3rd party stuff do since its easy to double check everything.
@_date: 2015-01-11 10:03:06
localbitcoins takes its price hints from centralized exchanges though
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:28:19
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:04:38
Because coinbase is a 3rd party and they can go down at any time or they can lock you out of your funds for a number of reasons
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:03:59
This is based on centralized systems and we're trying to get away from them.  
Theres a lot of overhead in verifying that an email address is actually linked to a bitcoin address.
I don't see thing working unless we use something like namecoin or bitid
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:25:29
Thats the kind of move that will bite you in the ass in the long run. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:56:07
CEX.io charges a maintenance fee so to keep a positive balance you need to produce more than they charge you.
Keeping servers in a datacenter costs money no matter if its making you a profit or not.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:09:19
The truth is theres no demand for this wether you like it or not.

You're giving him too much credit. He's just a thief not some evil mastermind.
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:27:31
Even if they do, bundling a lot of changes into one hardfork just calls for trouble
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:25:57
Mycellium had the same license from the beginning. Trezor tried to fool everybody trying to hide their changes, so they can bite my ass. I chose not to deal with such people.
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:26:23
I guess fees will be enough of an incentive. In the end is up to each miner to decide how much data they want to include but that doesn't mean we have to keep arbitrarily imposed limits like the 1mb limit.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:48:54
What time and effort are you putting in clicking one link ?
@_date: 2015-01-22 10:46:38
Turns out the api no longer sorts the output so I had to modify the script to do that.
I've created a github project for this:

You can always fork off and build something according to your own interpretation of game theory.

Downvote!. Such level headed opinions are not to be tolerated on this reddit.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:10:32
Any plans to add a bitcoin accepted here sign ?
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:22:16


It can happen due to a poorly handled hardfork, which is what we should be trying to avoid.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:16:24
Bitcoin doesn't care about what anyone wants. If something is doable it will be done and nobody can do anything about it. Thats the beauty of it.

LN is voluntary like all things in bitcoin

Sending CoinJoins from  Bitcoin core is already possible with Once this network matures it would be nice to have it integrated in bitcoin core. Theres already an electrum plugin in the works.

It wouldn't hold up, a TOS can't limit you from excercising your rights.

You can buy beer with bitcoin as well, just sayin'
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:02:58
The network is not only miners. 75% can move on the XT fork but if the users don't follow they will lose.
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:39:55
If you run a node and feel that you need to block XT you can use this simple script.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:38:44
Its not all about the storage.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:46:09
Bitcoin is the incentive
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:42:40
The block propagation time is just one aspect of increasing the block size, it also affects full nodes that are not mining.
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:03:49
Seems your problem is with wallets not properly estimating fees not with bitcoin. During all this time my transactions went through in the first block.
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:04:12
miners dont get to decide the upper limit
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:00:34
what community ?
some dudes on reddit are not the bitcoin community

When we get to live in a bitcoin world p2p transactions will be the norm. Perfect Privacy!

Everyone likes free stuff but the bitcoin network has real costs.

Miners can mine blocks over 1MB but if the rest of the network doesn't accept them they will create a hardfork and there no incentive in that.

Given that I just registered this today, I don't know :)  
Cluj has indeed a lot of IT talent, surprisingly it doesn't have more than 10 bitcoinners.

It helps the merchants accepting btc.  
So far the reports are not great and most merchants don't see enough btc volume.  
I'm a month away from having all my online expenses in btc.

Should be ready for mainnet in a few weeks

or just buy btc instead of paying twice the price due to electricity costs

Running your own exit node isn't such a hassle especially with the anonymity that bitcoin enables you to have. Plenty of hosts where you can order a vps with bitcoin. The software itself is a breeze to configure and run. Next best option is indeed oniontip
@_date: 2015-04-28 16:17:14
Thats basically it. 
Find a host that accepts bitcoin and allows running tor exit nodes
Install a debian server and follow a installation tutorial for the tor software shouldn't take too much to set up.
Once that is done theres nothing else you need to do except pay your bill.
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:03:43
Bitcoin doesn't care.

You're under the spell of the number 8 :)  
The number of expected inbound connections depends on the quality of your node.

I'm actively watching this and can't wait for main net tests.

As long as there isn't a fork that changes the encryption of the private keys you will be able to use the keys on all forks and redeem your bitcoinforks

you can play on testnet till you get the hang of it
@_date: 2015-03-03 10:44:45
This needs more attention. We need this kind of services opening everywhere
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:42:22
I started using this guys about a month a go because they are accepting bitcoin.
So far the service is without problems, if you're looking for a vps provider try them out for free. Only inconvenience is that you have to verify a credit card.
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:45:31
its a duck
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:12:45
It doesn't work like that. If bitcoin had a higher value then evolution wouldn't have same same amount of bitcoin in their possession.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:06:52
If bitcoin is not annonymous then who is the bitstamp hacker ?  
Sure its not annonymous by default but if you really want you can hide.

wishful thinking  
there aren't enough users spending btc  
so far bitcoin is better suited for large transactions, if you want micro payments you have to do it offchain  
the adult instrustry model is based on subscriptions which are a no go in the btc land  
No online service is making enough bling with bitcoin, just look at overstock numbers, they are declining.
