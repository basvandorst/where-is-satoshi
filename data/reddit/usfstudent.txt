If they didn't have any electrical disclaimers, instructions or warning labels on anything, go ahead and sue. Other than that, put some electrical tape on it and you shouldn't get shocked

Dropped to 530 from 600 in about two minutes time.

you're new to Bitcoins and you got them at $13 each. May I ask where you got these coins, that's a treasure

My recommendation is to buy, the market will pick back up later. Let the panic sellers panic, just recoup their losses

Its a limited currency that is supposed to climb in price to be easier to distribute to the masses.  I said the same in March at $145, you're going to be fine

Eventually it will, but there are the panic sellers. stupid panic sellers
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:02:44
go ahead and buy them, even when you get the chance, but make sure to be careful and have measures of security like everyone else. Don't panic if you see it falling, the market will stabilize on its own over time. That does not mean tomorrow or the next hour. Good luck!

Try a prezi. Its a little more exciting but definitely worth the time. Whatever company it is, good luck man. I would love to hear how it goes for you whether you use this or anyone else's!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:09:30
Nah, someone just sold a lot, its stabilizing

Diversify your crypto currencies man. Best thing to say for a more steady conservative growth buy some in Litecoin, Feathercoin and obviously bitcoin.
