There we go. There is your agenda. Someone stole "muh bitcoin"  there is no brand. There is no yours. There are asmany arguments for bitcoin cash calling themselves bitcoin as there is for bitcoin core. Even tho you dont like it there is. 
Judging by the whitepaper he has a point. 
Just like you can argue adding an entire different other network ontop is an logocal way to go. But you swayed from the original plan. Orignal name is bitcoin. There is asmuch logic to bitcoin calling it something else too. Lightningcoin. 
Desperately fighting over a name just make you look weakminded. Either both exist. Or the best one take over the name. If the name is sooo important then take an own and sway how far ypu want from the bitcoin plan as you wish. What would cry about then?
Still dont know who he is and why i should care. Why do ypu care sooooo much about some bitcoin cash i as a beliver in bitcoin cash dont even know who it is and why he matter. Bet its you angry sidetaking kids who give him the most attention

It's hard to believe people like this are real. How can you be so blind? Segwit aint enough, they can do the math themselves. they know it wont solve the problems Bitcoin has. Its a business they need to make money, they want to make money. I'm a consumer with cryptos. I'm getting riled up because you think i want to use something thats so fucking slow and costs me more to use than the items i want to buy. 
Either admit you just want a store of value, and in that case lightning dont matter, segwit dont matter. Those are for sending money. Transactions.
Or just admit you are living in a fantasy bubble dude. 
I litterly had to pay 20usd to buy a 30usd game with bitcoin. I'm stoked they are starting to accept others so i can buy shit without fees. 
God how is this so hard to grasp. its really this simple. We the customers want no fees. We want no fees NOW. When bitcoin has no fees again. (with no i mena so low it wont matter) you can come back arguing for this cause.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:00:50
Might be. But appearntly not working nearly good enough? Or are you sending almost free transactions? Because im not. I mean if you want to beat Bitcoin cash just be better. In practice. Not in theory. Bitcoin cash will dissapear ir bitcoin stop sucking for everything but cold storage of funds. I mean if thats all. We are already here. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:54:01
ITT, thinking the problem is another coins name and not the lack of functionality on BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:55:53
Isnt that the point of lightning? To sell out chains on top and take fees on them? like banking does
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:28:59
Yes we need segwit so that all transactions can be bottlenecked in segwit instead of original chain. Thats gonna solve all our problems. Oh wait. 
The problem is not segwit or not, (Who thought it was a good idea to make an addon solution on top of the chain?) obviously lots of companies gonna skip it.
The problem is Core is settling for a Store of Value instead of a payment system? Why i dont know, if its because they just cant solve the problems and are beeing quiet about it. Or they are payed to cripple BTC.
Ive been into btc for more than 4 years now, and i havent been able to use it when i needed it for the last 6 months. 
Idk why people think store of value is something special. Litterly any coin can do that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:27:38
Well. You said it yourself. Atleast its better. Your logic is missing? "This more successful bitcoin (functionalitywise) is not yet as good as the world leading transaction systems, that makes our superbad slow nowhere near usuable even at current levels the real bitcoin. Oh wait that makes no sense."
 Even if bitcoin cash isnt at visa levels. Its usuable today. Maybe bitcoin should reach usability TODAY before trying to bash the chain thats ahead in functionality? 
Is this just a echochamber now? Bitcoin is the only bitcoin because its not working and we got segwit which did nothing but enable some company sell chains built on top of it. Which will benefit them for sure. But noone else atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:33:39
Maybe the focus should be that their network actually works instead of this? Who cares for real.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:02:59
Neither is the bitcoin name. Its not holy scripture you can decide. With your logic bitcoin cash is the correct name just as much as bitcoin is. Should be glad they dont just call thenselves bitcoin with your logic!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:11:10
Wow nice move trying to once again twist the words. From the original comment it was explained what no fees meant. There was no need for "Telepathy" at all. Are you still trying to hide the fact that you was to fast on your fanboi fingers to write the comment before reading once again? Because in the end, reading what others say is not something you prioritize obivously. You have your agenda.
You may have the opinion that BTC is primary for store of value. I dont. And that will never be a problem. I dont have any argument for you to counter, it is you bitcoin core fanboys who are trying to target other coins instead of focusing on your own. Noone else is doing that. But we are tired of seeing you kids destroy all the communities because you think your store of value approach is the one and only bitcoin worldview who should exist.
Who is ver? Is he leading development on Bitcoin Cash? Is he a developer for Bitcoin Cash? If not, i dont care at all. And why should i? It's only you guys who choose to pinpoint different people as gods which your personal liking or the shortcomings of those people are directly connected to an huge cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:00:44
And segwit is not mentioned in the BITCOIN whitepaper. So if the names are so important maybe csll it segwitcoin? Since when is segwit a good thing. It made 0 difference atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:38:46
Obviously low fees.  I know there has to be an actual fee. Once again people on Bitcoin are nitpicking small things that does not matter. I wrote out what i meant with no fees. Are you not satisfied with an explanation to the statement you deemed confusing to grasp? Fine i should have written only low fees. Next time i will. Now come back to some actual facts instead of trying to find fault in stuff that does not matter.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:52:07
63million USD  = nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:05:53
Maybe read before you write. Are you a bot? I litterly explained that with no fees i mean so low it wont matter.
There is litterly no fact in that url. Its just someones own opinion. 
Are you paranoid or what? The goverments are gonna take over bitcoin if we increase the blocksize. Are you hearing yourself? 
They took gold in the 1900s! So we cant increase blocksize. 
If the countries in the world wanna make bitcoin useless. They will do without the slightest care about how big the blockchain is lol. 
You are using the same logic as the people saying bitcoin is a bubble and is worth nothing because tulips was. Connecting two things that has nothing to do with each other to make a point.
Hard drive space is not a problem lol. God how can you even think that it will be. Keep throwing buzzwords out. Wow bitcoin so decentralized payment, oh wait, not payment. Only decentralized controlled by a small group wanting to build something thats not bitcoin ontop of bitcoin to make money selling the app on top. 
Seriously tho, you guys can keep going for store of value, i dont mind, i use it as a store of value now mostly too. Since i cant shop with it. I'm just glad bitcoin cash and others are getting accepted with the big paymentsvendors so we can actually use the network after 8 years of development lol.

It worked to import wallet. Thanks alot ;D
 Gimme your btc/doge address for reward!
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:50:51
Which address Should i put in? I got many receaving addresses on my qt?
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:09:12
I did ;&gt;
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:27:43
I havent been able to find any info of the transaction online. Its only in my bitcoin-qt it would seem.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:46:11
An outpoint is already spent [(99517271, 0), (109922241, 9)]
Thats what i got as an response ;O;

Could you be so kind to explain how to run this pywallet. Im feeling like a noob but i broke a disk in my spine the other day so im having the patience of a 5year old atm due to the pain. Didnt get pywallet running in 30min of rage XD
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:25:33
Nope ; ( No info of the transaction at all on the blockchain. Its only in my wallet -qt its shown...
@_date: 2014-12-28 10:08:21
It seems really random, dropped both my iphone 4s and note 3 like 10+ times and none of them got even a crack in the screen. 
My iphone 4s fell down a couple of wooden stairs once too.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:36:38
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:29:28
i have made other transactions from the same bitcoin-qt wallet. is there any way to specify something more detailed? I have had several transcations go through to the same address since this one got stuck...
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:54:31
I am sorry if this has irritated you, putting it up there wasnt meant to be the focus of my post. The focus was which phones are we bitcoin users carrying around right now! 
I just wanted to give a bit of the story. Next time ill phrase it something more like the message i wanted out, "Only accepting payments in cryptos, no regular payment processors"
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:05:43
Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:41:32
Rest of the world has no caps tho. We didnt have data caps in the 90s even. Most normal people aint gonna run a node right? I got unlimited and hdd prices is supercheap and are deep into crypto since 2012. Im not running a node. And not because of size on hdd and caps lol.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:42:50
Obviously you havent been in any forum for any company stock before? or any other type of community for people who share common interests or investing.
It's true that there will be people like you say, will find some good news in any bad news. But in one way it actually helps. Why would we be here if everyone just posted the bad news others are saying?  Ive been around since before dogecoin existed and i have heard comments like his thousands of times.
Someone pointing out other big shots who said stupid stuff isnt really upsetting to me. And even tho you have a small point. What are you trying to accomplish with it? The poster has a small point too. Maybe a bit bigger than yours.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:31:09
Explain it like im 5 fomo transactions for 6 months?
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:27:53
Obviously you are allowed to say and think what you want. Even tho the level of relevance could clearly be discussed. It has some relevance. 
One comment from someone who does not want it to succeed out of all the people in the world should be less relevant to the cryptocurrency world than it apparently was. 
Its still a similar situation tho, you can say whatever you want. No one is saying its the exact same situation, sure if you only eating watermelon to find seeds, you gonna find seeds.  
The relevance is that its common in history (guess what, history matters) that high ups in a business category often down talk new and possible threatening solutions to them. 
Somewhere i hope that you understand that this is a CEO who made billions of trying to cheat regulations, basically sitting on a monopoly gold mine, takes his time to personally comment this in his words, little fraud on the sidelines.
If what he was saying was true, why would he bother to mention it?
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:22:43
Does USA still has data caps on normal home internet?
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:21:18
It's been good for a couple of weeks after beeing unusable (in the sense of reasonable fees) for 6months+. I'ts a bit to early to celebrate. Scaling will still be the biggest problem to solve. And why is it down now? Do so many people use lightning already?
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:56:28
Would you explain yourself, they are irrelevant to bitcoin in a way since they are not about bitcoin, but the fact that the people who is in a position of power in their business often downplay opponents is relevant. 
Since the CEO of a huge bank feel like its a must to spend his time making comments against Bitcoin. Its relevant to see how many others in the same position did that and got burned.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:26:38
It was invented in 2009, When it was called bitcoin. 2017 the majority wanted to build another chain instead and use that to solve bitcoins crippling transactionsproblems.
Even tho a majority was for that, it was not an huge majority so a great part of the community stayed with the original vision and solving transaction problems on chain and has since then been doing just that. Just like bitcoin has since then built another chain to use instead of bitcoin.
The whole name thing is so silly. Ive been into bitcoin since before i guess 99% of the ppl in this thread. I use bitcoin cash alot more since the fork, for obvious reasons. I dont like wasting money. 
Still use it more even tho btc got its transactions rates down to more accepteple levels. Because im to lazy to learn about using lightning etc. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:00:29
Common sense would have anyone actually feeling like they got scammed. Not you beeing angry on the internet because people dont have the same opinion as you. I use the website. I didnt get scammed. Stop beeing small kids now and move on.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:29:01
majority supported bitcoin to fork towards lightning. It was a minority that wanted to go bitcoin cash direction. If majority would have gone bitcoin cash direction, it would have been called bitcoin now. This is just about what the majority thinks. Maybe one day Bitcoin cash will be bitcoin, maybe bitcoin will be called just lightning or something else. or a third version eats both up because of all this childish stuff going around.
"You dont know computer science if you dont agree with me" 
Okay there buddy. I wont comment on that.
Instead of assuming users are too lazy to use the product you endorse. Maybe you should start cleaning your own house. If you want bitcoin over bitcoin cash, it should be easier to use. Not harder. Simple as that.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:28:46
I dont think you know what a scam is. ;O;
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:03:11
Wait, will bitcoin cash have a value you think?
