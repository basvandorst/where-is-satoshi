In case anyone is interested in the details, origin, and resolution of the bug, it's discussed over here:

But... the market cap means two totally separate things for a currency and for a company.
A slightly more meaningful comparison would be the transaction volume of WU and BTC. According to blockchain.info this has been around **$170M/day for BTC** for the past 30 days, while Western Union has had $81.6 billion in consumer-to-consumer transfers[0], which made up 79.21% of their revenue[1], so I guess we can estimate an annual turnover of $103 billion, which comes out to **$282M/day for WU** over the year of 2015. And this isn't a very fair comparison either, since all of WU's transactions are actual transfers, while probably lots of Bitcoin transactions are just currency exchange.

Why is this post allowed?

I think [Airbitz]( is pretty good.

Darn. I don't like these mods.

Shouldn't this resistance you're speaking of be visible in the order book? I don't really see anything at $1163 [on GDAX](

Could be solved with a QR code for the address, with a matching Bitcoin app that can read QR codes. If the merchant has a screen to display the QR code on, the computer could automatically calculate the price from the current exchange rate and embed it in the QR code as well.

Do you perhaps happen to need 1.42 more BTC? :P
@_date: 2011-05-19 11:55:18
Great, thanks, I'll contact you in a few days, once I have at least 2.0 in my account.

I have 0.32 BTC, I do not consider myself a representative of the Bitcoin community.
I also think even this argument of yours is simply stupid. Wait, you had no other arguments. Never mind, then.

Uh, are you sure? I think it might have been either that your miners found shares, but you thought they were blocks. They are completely different, usually a pool finds more than a million shares before actually finding a block. Or maybe the pool itself found blocks and you thought your CPUs did, which means that one of the ~1000 PCs on MtRed found a block, and you got a small share of the reward amount the block yielded, probably less than 0.0001 BTC.

I'm not sure about this, but I think yes. A long poll notification, from my guess, is a message from the pool to the miner that a new block was found, so the miner knows it should start working on a new one. Your miner displayed one of these. I think.

Well there's already a standard for textual markup of transaction data, I don't think anyone would use a different one, so that's not really a problem.

I really wasn't trying to say anything deep with this. I just replaced Soylent with Bitcoin in [this comment]( and thought it was funny, plus I was curious what responses it would get.
