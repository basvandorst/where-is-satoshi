Definitely that, but for those that don't have compassion for their fellow man, it's actually  more cost effective in the long run for a society to take care of the elderly, homeless and handicapped. Of course it requires basic math skills and foresight to understand that... so, dumb people still going to say, "not my problem!"

@_date: 2018-08-02 17:56:58
It's doing pretty well for itself and it works. Unless I'm missing something, it's also closer to what bitcoin was described as and for in the white paper. It feels like BTC evolved into a different type coin (a unit of storage) during the split and BCH stayed the same (P2P). Personally, I don't think there's anything wrong with either of them accept for a the two communities hating on each other. I find it very destructive.

Agreed. If the censorship and name calling would be taken out of the situation and we had reasonable discussions we'd all be in far better place.
@_date: 2018-08-02 18:01:43
Yes. Both BTC and BCH have **evolved** from the original blockchain. It's not that hard to understand. One of them is closer to what bitcoin was described as being in the whitepaper. I've got both but only one was what I signed up for 5 years ago.

@_date: 2017-03-02 18:14:27
Fair enough... but why all the censorship and banning? That's what's concerning about this whole situation. It seems out of character for the type of people that are attracted to bitcoin to show that kind of behavior towards confrontation. I don't trust it.
I'm not going to pretend to know exactly what all the drama is about but in my experience censorship is used by people that are hiding the truth. I'm not the only one that thinks like that. It makes r/bitcoin look like the bad guys.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:02:35
Why can't we have an open discussion? We can all agree we want what's best for bitcoin, right? 
I'm sure both sides are going to get catty and say mean things at times. We're all grown ups here and I don't think we need "protecting". Besides, the better part of us will wont be assholes.
It's like two parents fighting over their kid. That kid isn't going to thrive with all the fighting. 
I don't understand why we can't talk about it here. Can we bring in a neutral party and have a controlled debate? or are we too far gone?

My neighbor uses bitcoin more than anyone I know. He's not that smart, he doesn't understand it at all, he doesn't give two shits about the benefits of Bitcoin, he doesn't think it's cool, and doesn't care if it revolutionizes the world. All he wants is his drugs from the dark web.
So, it doesn't matter if we "spread the word". It doesn't matter if make it sound interesting, simple, important or positive. Right now the killer application for bitcoins is buying drugs. Find something else that you can only get with bitcoin that *everyone wants* and we wont have to do shit... It'll catch like wild fire.

People from all over the world go through this place. France, Australia, England, Brasilia... I'm a 40 year old man with a wife and a 2 year old. I've got a good job where I can help out when we can. Our washer and drier is at their disposal, they get a lot of left overs, weekly trips to cosco, my BBQ is free game... Whatever I can do to help these kids out I'll do.

Even if they dabble with each of these points that are a lesser threat they can potentially be successful. Death by a thousand cuts is can be a viable strategy at this point without calling too much attention to what's going on and who's doing it. It's what I'd do and very "art of war".
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:05:13
Think of it like the band Genesis. When Peter Gabriel left the he sort of took the bands sound and style with him. Genesis then  grew to create a new sound. Both he and the band went on to be hugely successful but their fans still argue about who embodies the original. Peter Gabriel and the band didn't really have any animosity towards each other but unfortunately, in the case of BTC and BCH, the people behind everything do and encourage the fans to fight each other.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:27:49
First of all, I'm not on either side and I don't understand all the tech behind it. I do however keep my ears open and try make decisions for based on what I can understand. Forgive me if I don't have all the information but from what I understand BTC had admittedly changed it's philosophy of being a peer to peer currency as per the white paper to something closer to a store of value whereas BCH is striving to be closer to to what BTC was created for. So who's fooling innocent people about which is the real Bitcoin? It seems like both parties are guilty of that.  
I get that calling it "Bitcoin Cash" was kind of a shitty thing to do and I also get that the tech behind BTC might have had to change. What I don't get is the shitty fighting on both sides. I hate it. It's petty. We're on the cusp of something great and we should be encouraging each other.

It reminds me of when they decriminalized pot in Colorado and they were all making bong reference as jokes. Immediately after some stupid pun you'd always say the same thing, "Hahaha... I don't even know what a bong is". 
It really sheds light on the fact that everything on the news has some kind of scripted agenda. I don't think it's a big conspiracy or anything but I do believe they do it for ratings. There's some guy out there somewhere that analyses how news is perceived as entertainment value  and "colors" how it's presented to keep an audience. Right now, Bitcoin is being presented silly nonsense that some computer geeks made up.

I understand that the amount of currency in circulation can rise and fall (it doubled from 2000) and I have no doubt that biocoin will add the total but saying Bitcoin will reach $100K is unfathomable to me in the near future. Believe me, I WANT it to happen but it's pipe dream. I'm not an economist by a long shot but when you look at the numbers they bring you down to earth a bit.

Still holding... I haven't lost my investment yet. I'm in for the long run anyway. I've very happy I didn't put in more than I could lose. I was very tempted a few times.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:13:45
What a great read.
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:37:28
Yeah, you're right... Thanks for being rational

Localbitcoins.com was easiest for me but I'm in Canada. Buying in the us isn't bad hard at most places.
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:30:12
If they bring up how Bitcoin is used for drug trafficing, terrorism, and CP remind them that that so is the cash that they all have in their pockets. Even more so than Bitcoin.

That's good to hear

Who the hell needs them anymore, anyway? In a decade the only people using them will be old people that can't wrap their head around bitcoin. They'll go the way of the horse and carriage by the time our kids are in college

If I had a 10K+ bitcoins I'd be bleeding them out slowly. A big cash in would be kinda stupid. Where would you put it all?... a bank?

Love it...
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:47:45
I thought the same thing at 30$... Then at 40$... And at 50$... When it hit 60$ I said fuck it and bought what I could afford. It wasn't much. The next week I bought a little more. I have 4 total and I can't afford to buy any more for a while but I will once I've got a couple extra bucks in my pocket. 
I think the party is just starting. You may never have thousands of coins, in fact, relatively few people do. But years from now you will still be considered an early adopter and have been one of the few to have had the foresight to bet on something that can change things for the better. 
Everyone always says to invest what you can afford to lose. The same rule applies to a 5$ btc as a 100$ btc. Don't be afraid to roll the metaphorical dice and start small.

I agree that skepticism is good but it should enable one to ask questions not mock after barely grazing the surface of an idea. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 17:57:29
I'm a Montrealer and francophone Quebecers are going to eat this up. There's a very strong sense of distrust to the government among the population. They're also put a lot of value on their money, are very frugal and tend to do their banking at co-ops and credit unions. 
This "embassy" might be what it takes to get the word out... who knows.

Just to give you an idea of how big bitcoin would have to get in order to hit $100K think about this:
If Bitcoin was the size of the Canadian dollar ($43.8 Billion US) it would be a $3650 with the 12 million coins we have mined. 
If it replaced the US dollar it would only be $70K
As of 2008 there was 4 trillion dollars (US) of every currency that exists in circulation. If Bitcoin replaced ALL of them today with only 12 million coins was mined they would be worth $330K each. So Bitcoin would have to have 1/3 of every currency in distribution to reach $100K.
I'm a believer as much as the next guy but I don't see it happening in my lifetime. 
*I'm only comparing Bitcoin to cash as an example of how much money would need to be worth for it to be worth $100K.

If you buy 2000 euros with US dollars from the bank the bank doesn't lose the 2000 euros. They do however charge you an exorbitant fee and a shitty exchange rate. The only one losing in that case is you.

I think we're past making them on layman devices. The cost of electricity to mine is more than you'll make.

I understand the risks and I'm not gambling a lot. I just want to know some tips on how to protect my wallet, how to make a transaction properly, the best way to back up my wallet, and anything else I may need to know. Basically, I need a user FAQ.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:16:15
Yes, I actually believe the same thing. I'm was only comparing Bitcoin to cash as an example of how much money would need to be worth for it to be worth $100K. Nothing more or less.

E-transfer [here]( You've gotta pay fees and they cost a little more but you can get them in 10 minutes tops.

Exactly. Is that possible? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:31:47
Yeah, there's a lot of talk about the crypto side of the coin and they bring up others. I'm not saying it was a hoot but you should go. Expect it to start late btw but it's good because people get to meet each other

The government could just buy a shitload of Bitcoins and manipulate the market so badly that they'd be unusable.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:56:03
Buy 50 bucks worth... I've been throwing a little in my wallet every couple of weeks or so and I've got about 6 BTC now. I started when they were at 65$. I've more than doubled my money and I'm constantly entertained with being obsessed about it. It's fun as hell!
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:15:45
I went to the one a couple months ago. It was interesting. There's a good mix of people there from curious newbs to people developing new ideas and services. It's not a total geek fest but I was talking to some people about stuff that was way over my head. The talks were loosely organized but informative and casual which I liked. They seemed to cover a lot too. Mining, security, ease of use, marketing... stuff I don't understand. I went to check it out and I left impressed. It did feel like some people were keeping their cards close to their chest and other were trying to peek at them I suppose that's to be expected.

I ain't sellin' shit. In fact, I'm going to buy more once it levels off.

I'm also going to start accepting bitcoins at work. I'm in a niche market and I don't think it'll be too much of a risk. My wife on the other hand deals predominantly with e-commerce and they've been talking to they're web guys about making it happen.

As important as it is to have an easily available explanation on the fundamentals of Bitcoin I think we should realize that only a small percentage of the population understand how the US dollar works. I think if we start pushing the the what's and why's down people throats they're going to get turned off. The best way to get people using bitcoins is to make it easy for them to get them, spend and make it more attractive than CC or cash. 
As genius as the concept of bitcoin is, any great explanation will fall on deaf ears if they have to "learn hard stuff" to use it.
It's got to be like: (Typical marketing cool guy voice) "Hey dude. Did you hear about bitcoin? It's this new super cool internet money that you can use like cash. Just go here, do this and that and BOOM... the future!!"... and it almost has to be that horrible but it *should be* that easy.

It's not necessary for people to understand how it works just how to use it. People are curious because it's new but once it's widely used and common enough people won't care. I doubt Little Suzy Q high schooler will give 2 shits about what a blockchain is when she's buying a new twerking shorts.

Travel. I'm in Colombia as I'm typing this right now. Take 3 months off and do it. I wish I did it at your age. There's so much to see and learn out here. I recommend central and south America but there's a hell of a lot more places to do.
 Stay off the beaten path and challenge yourself. Stay with a family in the jungle and experience what its like to be as  happy as they are with very little.
 Work for nothing in a hostel or a while and meet other travelers. People from different countries and cultures have very diverse views of life. You can learn a lot from them.
I recommend going alone too. 3 months on the road alone can really define you and give you two solid feet to stand on when you're ready to take those important first steps as a man.

Ask them if they remember the time before credit cards. It was that long ago. People had doubt's about them as well.
