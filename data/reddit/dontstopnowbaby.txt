Fuck. Why did i put my btc address when it said you would credit into the buckyroom account.
* You may want to fix the width and length auto scaling on some of the pages. The forum for example does not have a minimum scale. Fixing the length of the tables on the forum page to a minimum and whatever browser goes below that will automatically open the scroll bar would be good add on.
* Set the top Buckyroom logo to home page, once i enter the forum the top logo redirects to the forum home only.
* Found out that when sending credits, your site would look through the database everytime a user keys in a name or alphabet in the "To:" section. Under high load this may actually be bad for you as it will perform a search query database for user names or anything that has the input in the name ie i key in 'a' i get everyone who has an 'a' in their name.
