Yup, I agree. It's just unnecessarily harder to get the point across as easily with POST. People find URLs difficult as it is.

Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 21:02:20
Nah you're right, it's not logical to grant someone access to your money, while not granting access to your money :) a limit order would necessitate access in the simplest case.
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:19:06
Cheers and thanks :)

You cannot automate trades unless you have complete access to your funds. However, if you trade manually, they should require authorization from you. The best way of doing this is by requiring your signature on a transaction.
Keep in mind exchanges tend to do 'off-chain' transactions. When they do off-chain transactions, they're not really executing a Bitcoin transaction -- they're just moving numbers around in their own databases.

You could lose your key if you lose your Secret PIN. We store an encrypted form of your private key at Block.io (think Blockchain.info, but MultiSig), and we perform hourly on- and off-site backups to ensure we can never lose the encrypted data.
So: if you lose your Secret PIN and Secret Mnemonic, yes, you'll lose your coins. They'll just sit there in that address until you remember what the Secret PIN was.

Look out for it and C# in the next couple of days :)

Very valuble words, my friend. Will update you on the progress at a later date :)

I agree, I've edited the above to remove the private key bit.

Creating and managing wallets is a chore as it exists right now. Block.io just makes it alot easier, and it doesn't control your money either. 
Think about creating your own tipping bots, or Facebook wallets, or simply accepting payments on your website. Now think about setting up infrastructure for these, especially if you're not relying on bitcoind. With bitcoind, things will get slow, fast, as your wallet.dat builds up. With this, they won't, because we're indexing the entire Blockchain for you.
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:06:25
We've taken great pains to ensure we're not logging any sensitive data (see  for a list of our practices so far, but they're continually evolving). Regarding the PIN: you can use POST methods  for these if you wish.
Regarding private keys: we don't store private keys, we instead store an encrypted HD seed, and we do not know how to decrypt this by choice. This 'choice' will be removed in API v2, when we introduce multisig. Users will sign their transactions client-side.
We're still evolving, and all of your feedback is very valuable to us.
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:06:14
Indeed, developers. You'd be surprised.

When someone not using Block.io's MultiSig addresses sends you some coins, we cannot guarantee that they won't try to re-spend the coins they just sent you. We have to wait for the Blockchain to tell us that the coins you just received can never be spent again. This is essentially the Bitcoin network 'confirming' a transaction once. We typically want to wait at least 3 confirmations before we know for certain that the coins you received can never be spent again. Once 3 confirmations are reached, you can give the payer their merchandize, or whatever they gave you the coins for.
With our Green Addresses, we require two signatures: yours, and Block.io's. Since Block.io is unable to successfully push any transaction without your signature, every withdrawal/transaction coming from your MultiSig address is guaranteed to have your approval. Further, it's guaranteed to have our approval aswell, being an address that requires both our signatures (2 of 2). Block.io will only sign transactions if it knows they are not 'double spends,' therefore the recipient, if they trust Block.io, can spend the coins they just received without waiting for network confirmations.
Make sense? :)
By the way, this idea has been implemented at least once before by GreenAddress.it.

No limits, ever. The pricing page lists three plans; the pricing for the Architect and Master is loose, and the Empowered is and always will remain free.
@_date: 2014-10-07 17:44:06
yup, they can
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:35:05
It doesn't need to be in a closed system, but yes, for now it is. Also, these are Block.io addresses. GreenAddress.it is completely different.
Integration with Block.io's green addresses is simple: we have two API calls (is_green_address, is_green_transaction) that your wallet provider can query to spend funds without confirmation, if they trust block.io.

Exchanges can use your funds from your wallets without your input because the addresses that hold your funds are controlled by a single Private Key, which is controlled by the exchange themselves.
If they get hacked, the hacker can get access to this solitary private key... taking your funds out of that address is then a simple task. Two-factor authentication is a band-aid that protects front gate, but not the back door.
With our MultiSig, you have 2 signatures for every address. This means every withdrawal requires 2 private keys to execute -- one private key is under your control, and the second is under Block.io's control. No one, not even Block.io, can execute the withdrawal without your consent.

On  you'll see two calls at the bottom of the page: is_green_address and is_green_transaction. The employee at the register can check either whether the sending address is green, or the incoming tx is green.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:53:36
thank you :)

Cheers for this. We're looking for contributors for C The library is in the works, but your input would just speed it up that much more:

Aye aye, we're expanding soon.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:20:15
Nah, you're not dumb. One Bitcoin confirmation = 10 minutes on average. Green Addresses help get around this.
@_date: 2014-08-19 16:02:28
Look out for it :) API v2 is in the works.
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:22:22
Hmm, being perceived this way is why multisig is absolutely necessary for us. Thank you for the feedback, multisig+clientside signing isn't far off :)

Alas, 6K+ users have this installed on Chrome.

Free Testnet coins to help you test your apps as soon as you sign up. Testnets are meant for debugging your Bitcoin-focused applications so you don't lose actual Bitcoin while testing your applications. For example, there was a transaction yesterday that paid 27 BTC in Fees accidentally. Testnets can help you avoid problems like that
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:17:00
Good question. Plot twist: why's blockr.io similar to block.io? :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:54:08
You can use POST here. The text indicates this. But you're right, the default example should just be a POST.
Packet sniffers... that's another topic for another time.
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:35:40
I understand, and I can see that. Will be clearer in the future :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:16:23
Not yet, but if you need it, we'll get it there :)
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:29:24
I love that you find it easy to use, that's the entire goal here.
The functionality can be implemented on any device that can fetch a URL, so yes, mobile devices are ready to go for sure :)
Let me know if you need anything or have any question when you get started.
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:16:24
thanks, el presidente :)

Agreed on the zero TX fee -- it's actually zero service fee as pointed out.
This service is different from Chain.com since it focuses on getting your wallet-based apps up and running quickly. Chain.com is more general, and needs alot of education before you can get started.
Building a wallet is super simple with Block.io, if I could say so myself :) Our devs tend to go from nothing to a usable wallet/payment service in their own apps within 15min, minus polish, ofcourse.

It's connected to 75 for now, but will listen to a lot more in a month or so. Will add a view for that, and relayed IPs :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 09:42:01
This API will remain free indefinitely. Webhooks are the only thing might be considered premium though :)
The requests aren't capped, although if you do need a large amount of calls (say, 1M calls a month), we should set something dedicated for you.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:05:17
28 :/
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:50:07
haha, noted. we'll make some changes :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:53:24
You cannot tell which account that address belongs to, and you can create as many addresses as you need on Block.io. There's no violation of users' privacy here, at least not any more than any Block Explorer.
@_date: 2014-10-07 14:44:18
Indeed :)

The browser seems to think this field requires an integer, when it shouldn't. We're looking into it right now.
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:20:35
This is a browser-side validation error. What browser and OS is this?
Also, how is this browser issue making Block.io suspicious?
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:39:48
@_date: 2015-02-06 01:44:04
resolved now -- was having trouble locating it, then noticed you're on API V1. I'd recommend you create an API V2 account soon to use MultiSig.
