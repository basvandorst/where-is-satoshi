I can't log in at all. I know my email, username, and pretty sure I know my password but no luck :(
The offline claim seems to ask me how much bitcoin I had in the system, while I'm 90% sure it was 2.4 what happens if I'm wrong about that?

I don't think it's fair to say they have nothing. They have money, the danger is that they wake up tomorrow and the money they have is not the same as it was when they went to bed. If you store your savings ouwith a bank then that risk is no longer present. The government cant seise it or switch it's currency for another.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:31:16
Believe it or not (this relates to the UK, but probably the rest of the EU too) if you went into a bank and asked for your life savings (let's say €100,000) they would send you away. Banks don't have enough money to give that amount to one customer in one transaction. When I worked for Santander if you wanted more than (I think it was) 5k you had to call a day in advance and arrange it.
There are also criminal and fraud assurances that the bank has to meet before they will hand you over more than 10k in cash.
TL;DR: Banks don't have to give you your own money on demand.

If it's anything like the house of lords they probably turn up for their daily payment and then sleep.
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:59:06
If we knew that it would have happened already. These things can't really be announced in advance. You go to bed and you wake up with a different currency. If it was announced in advance there would be a run on the banks as people withdraw their euro.

Then get a BACS payment? I'm really surprised how negative towards CeX people seem to be, I've never had a single problem with them. Perhaps I'm missing something :\

My local CEX store name their secure WiFi "Protected CEX" and the public one as "Unprotected CEX"

Possibly because we're not Eurozone, maybe different rules or something. Also nobody knows if the pound will still exist next week, rumour is George Osborne is planning to gather all the money and burn it in a massive hissy fit :p
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:10:22
Something I'll add that wont be apparent to outsiders is that CeX gives off quite a "young" vibe. You practically need a tattoo and a taste for metal to work there, the promotional materials and store decoration is styled a bit like graffiti and is sometimes a bit aggressive in tone.

That doesn't make sense to me, surely he had more than one copy of the keys and if someone stole one set he could transfer the lot to a new wallet and the problem is solved.

Exactly how I feel about it.

Get a fucking grip. If a bitcoin wallet is the most important thing to you then clearly don't get an iPhone. Personally I like a like a decent phone that works, that does not make me a "sheep".

As someone intelligent and who mined 5 BTC, and who has been scammed a number of times down to 1.6 BTC I'm starting to wonder if they are right :p

If you had done any research at all you would be aware that the atmosphere and the forces of gravity bend the light so eventually the world seems to "disappear" which gives the illusion of the Earth being a sphere. it is in fact flat. Do your research.

There really is no excuse for this, as an app developer I always spend time to ensure my apps are accessible to the visually impaired. Not only by ensuring my controls are Voiceover compliant but also adding extra prompts where necessary. However a big part of it is ensuring your apps user interface is clean and logical, because making an app accessible to the visually impaired actually makes your app better for everyone. "Inclusive design is design for all" as they say.
I hope the developers of Bitcoin QT take note of this now you have brought it to their attention. Bitcoin should be for everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:53:08
Yeah it's really annoying when I have a minor problem with my phone and they just apologise and replace it on the spot. They should make me go three weeks with out a phone like very one else does!

You know what we should do, in the interest's of being an awesome "for the people" community? Why don't we all club together and fill up a Bitcoin address for the poor lass? Just an idea.
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:43:23
You're welcome guys! Glad I could help by selling most of my Bitcoin literally the night before this recent rise. I did warn everyone I know in advance to buy but I don't think anyone did.

Not been following things for a while. What the heck is going on? BU?
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:01:53
Not sure if anyone has said this yet but DO NOT plug this into your primary system, at least not with your current HDD plugged in. I may be paranoid but it's feasible someone has installed code on this to scan and steal your wallets or take other malicious action. Adding the BTC on the label to draw in a suitable victim.
Also you'll want to run recovery software on it if you are looking to snoop around all the data it holds.
Also if this story is even true, I'd guess most likely the BTC thing is entirely unrelated to Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:32:27
Yeah, on both occasions where I have had to sell BTC the price IMMEDIATELY shoots through the roof. I'm thinking about starting a charity where I buy Bitcoin and then sell it  so everyone else makes a huge profit.

I'm usually found in the Glasgow one at Exchange Square. However it looks from the picture as if the Manchester one also has a piano (see the top right of that picture you linked, you can see it's feet).

I managed to get it working, moved my wallet to another app and made the transaction again. Seems Bitcoin-QT failed to make the transaction on the network but had applied the transaction locally. Thanks for your help :)

Ryanair don't buy fuel often, their planes run on prayers and Michael's hot air.
EDIT: I'm serious, they had three planes in one day declare PAN after running low on fuel. They put in what regulations require and not a drop more. Good luck to you if the region you are flying to has bad weather!
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:55:39
I honestly wouldn't fly with them unless I absolutely had no choice. They're an accident waiting to happen. 
They were even looking into buying aircraft without the window shutters just to save a few quid. I get they are no frills but really? Window shutters?

The main problem, and this happened to me, is the cooling fan. Mine died shortly after a year. Luckily my supplier no longer stocked the card so they gave me a full refund, which I used to buy a better card with a free copy of Bioshock Infinite! If keep up the mining I'll never pay for a video card again! ;) 
Not an expensive fix out of warranty either mind.

Royal Bank of Scotland sent me one of these devices years ago and I took it to the branch and told them to remove this system from my online account. The only thing these plastic devices are good for is killing the planet. I ended up changing bank because the system was such an inconvenience. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:12:28
They could do exactly the same with this device, accesses the bank system, forward on the OTC, you do your thing and enter the information, they take it and put it into the genuine system and *bam* money is gone. The difference between the two systems is that I don't need to carry a useless device with me at all times (I'm not a woman) and the environment isn't dying in the process.
Maybe the two systems we are talking about are not the same one, but what my bank offered me required the user to be just as vigilant as without, so it was an utterly pointless and wasteful system.

Here is the device I am referring to :) 
EDIT: Yes, I note that you mention you need to put in the recipients account number and the value of the transaction, so the systems are different. Apologies, because the system your bank uses justifies it's existence, unlike RBS's :p

This is something I've been meaning to ask about, does this mean if I store a wallet on a flash drive for two years while using the wallet on my system, when I come to use it will the old backup be useless? In short, do I need to make regular backups and if so how often (in terms or time or transactions?)
@_date: 2013-06-05 23:03:23
When a set up a new payee on my new bank account they give me a call to confirm it's genuine. No useless over-engineered plastic crap required.
I warned them when I gave them it back that this would do nothing to protect a moron from a man in the middle attack, and less than a year later they splash their home page with warnings about possible man in the middle attacks.

Bitcoin is 'cash', if you don't look after it you'll loose it. People are dumb enough to give up their details for their actual bank account, no amount of security can guard against carelessness. The Bitcoin system IS secure, but if you hand someone your cash you no longer have it. If you're not capable of securing your computer you're gonna to have a bad time, regardless of whether you use Bitcoin or not.

What version of Mac OS are you running? File Vault in Lion and Mountain Lion encrypts your entire hard disk transparently, you don't even notice it. If your hard disk is removed from your Mac there is no way anyone can access the data without the decryption key. You can also encrypt external drives. I don't use File Vault myself as I don't have need for it.
