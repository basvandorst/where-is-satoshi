Is there a way to help the blockchain stay healthy If I bought a "useless" USB asic of ebay and just ran it no expectation of reward?
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:56:56
Yeah, It was frozen since about 11pm last night. Watched the whole dip for 3 hours and it didn't budge.
My biggest annoyance was I sold coins trusting the price was changing (without checking) so I could buy back later, but it hasn't budged and now I'm worried they won't fix it until it goes above what it's stuck at.
*edit to add: They need to add a "price last updated" message so when it doesn't work at least we know it's stuck. Currently the price history and how they get that number is completely hidden.

*Apple may or not may do something!*
Article contents:
APPLE could face a massive battle with financial institutions if it goes ahead and offers its users a competing digital wallet in a market it is entering late.
Christophe Uzureau, president of banking and investment services at analyst firm Gartner, told The Australian yesterday that Apple would face "a very different game" competing against digital wallets already in the marketplace developed by financial institutions along with Visa and MasterCard.
Apple has not officially confirmed the move, but The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple is laying the groundwork for a physical store payments service that would leverage the payment card details of hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad owners registered for making payments with iTunes.
A digital wallet is security software that lets users store debit and credit card details, identification cards such as a driver's licence, and loyalty cards on a smartphone or other device. Consumers can pay for goods at shops by waving their phone in front of a sensor.
The Journal reported that Apple's iTunes and App Store chief, Eddy Cue, had met technology industry executives in the US to discuss Apple's interest in handling payments for physical goods and services on its devices, according to its sources.
The report said Apple had commissioned long-time online stores manager Jennifer Bailey to build a payment business within the technology giant, again according to sources.
But an Apple offering will be one of many in the digital wallet space. Visa's V.me, Mastercard's MasterPass, PayPal, Google, telcos in the US, and banks are already well advanced in offering a similar service.
In Australia, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, National Australia Bank and Westpac are all involved in reading digital wallet options. In November last year, CBA announced it was collaborating with MasterCard to offer MasterPass to its customers.
Also in November, PayPal, which has 4.6 million Australian users, said it was offering retailers point-of-sale software that used facial recognition and let customers check in at stores to pay for goods. All its users would be able to use the PayPal app on a mobile device to make retail payments.
Start-ups such as Square and Stripe are also offering digit wallets and Microsoft has been active in the digital wallet space for years. Mr Uzureau said the market needed to be careful when assessing Apple's chances of success. "When you start to look at retail, it's a very different game," he said.
"The cost of integrating (Apple's solution) into point-of-sale and satisfying regulations - clearly there is a steep learning curve. And you have to manage the security very differently. You are in a more open environment."
Apple's apparent decision to offer a digital wallet solution comes as no surprise given that archrival Google first implemented its wallet solution in the US in 2011.
Last year Google announced it would make Google Wallet available for Apple's iPhone.
Currently, Apple handles payments for movies, books and music purchased through its iTunes store. Consumers can also buy apps and pay for items such as digital goods within an app through an iTunes account. It offers a limited voucher storage service - Apple Passbook.
In its retail stores, Apple lets shoppers pay for some products by scanning the item and paying with a credit card tied to iTunes.
In contrast to Android phone manufacturers, Apple has not implemented Near Field Communication (NFC) in its phones, the method commonly used for contactless payments. Current-model iPhones need a special NFC case or NFC sticker for contactless NFC payments.
Apple's fingerprint reader, introduced on the iPhone 5S, and its alternative iBeacon location-sensor technology could be developed for retail payments, but retailers may baulk at installing multiple systems.
While the likes of Apple and Google eye the digital wallet space, they face competition from biometric technology such as that developed by Japanese multinational firm Fujitsu. Its technology can recognise a consumer by scanning their veins and linking their scan to a credit card held on file. Neither cards nor smartphones are needed.
Telsyte research director Foad Fadaghi said Apple would be entering an already busy market. "The challenge is there is a lot of existing payment providers who own that space," Mr Fadaghi said.
But he said Apple had a history of disrupting markets. "A company like Apple has proven its ability to disrupt and that could prove a challenge to the establishment," he said.
"The company has a lot of potential with its global users. It could present a challenge to other payment systems such as credit cards and EFTPOS," Mr Fadaghi said.
Mr Uzureau said digital wallets give the likes of Google and Apple another way to accumulate data about users.
With billions of dollars at stake, the fierceness of the battle to dominate digital wallets became evident last year when US telcos Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile sought to block Google Wallet accessing the "secure element" located on the SIM card on smartphones. The secure element is a tamper-proof environment for digital wallet functionality.
Google responded by making it possible for developers to bypass the secure element in its latest version of Android, KitKat.

Couldn't see anything on their site; they claim a 20 year life span but I can barely read receipts from 3 years ago, which have been kept inside boxes away from light.


Isn't this just normal thermal receipt paper?
Love the idea, I would trust it for long term storage though without getting a bit more info.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:31:15
I'll see if there's an export option...
*edit: no export, so I'll just brute force this :)
step 1: Load url 
step 2: if not 200 status
step 2.a: exit
step 3: end if
step 4: Delay for 1 second
step 5: Repeat while page doesn't contain "Bet amount cannot be more than your balance"
step 5.a: click html element with id "double_your_btc_bet_hi_button"
step 5.b: Delay for 3 seconds
step 5.c: set a variable with name "btc_stake" to the value of "double_your_btc_stake"
step 5.d: if page doesn't have text "You lose"
step 5.d.1: Do Javascript: (this halves if we didn't lose)
    var bet = fake.get('btc_stake');
    bet = bet/2;
    if (bet &lt; 0.00000001) {
        bet = 0.00000001
    }
    fake.set('btc_stake',bet);
step 5.d.2: Set value of element "double_your_btc_stake" to "${btc_stake}"
step 5.e: else
step 5.f.1: Do Javascript: (this doubles if we lose)
    var bet = fake.get('btc_stake');
    bet = bet*2;
    fake.set('btc_stake',bet);
step 5.e.2: Set value of element "double_your_btc_stake" to "${btc_stake}"
step 5.f end if
step 6. end repeat
Probably can make it much more robust and move the "set value" (step 5.d.2 and step 5.e.2) outside of the if statement. Wouldn't hurt to have a dead-man switch so it doesn't gamble all the money. (e.g. stop if a bet would place me below the payout figure or something)
You could probably do more in javascript, but I don't know what I'm doing! :)
If you have more than 8 elements Fake need to be the non-demo version.

No idea how to do it though, the closet I've seen is the pool table that takes bit coins.

Maybe it's because over the last 40 years saving money in a bank has become worthless, and people have learned to be good consumers and keep spending.
Just one theory.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:04:06
I can still see it, strange. I'll just paste it here:
I went to do a cash deposit into my CoinJar account today (here's my referral link if you're interested in signing up. It's an Australian based bitcoin exchange)
To deposit money into my coinjar account, I can either do a bank transfer which takes a day or two, or a cash deposit in person at a branch, which takes 15 mins to process. So I go and stand in the queue for 20 minutes waiting to make my deposit, while idly thinking "If this was bitcoins, I'd be finished by now."
Previously while making deposits and talking to the tellers, they had all asked "coin jar, what's that?"
Today was an exception; After looking at the deposit slip, the teller said straight away "bitcoins hey, I've seen a few of these come through", which resulted in a quick 2 minute chat about bitcoins while he processed the deposit.
Nothing on the deposit slip said bitcoin (just coinjar), so I was surprised he called it straight away. It seems awareness is spreading. Not Joe Bloggs general public, but a bank teller is getting closer.
