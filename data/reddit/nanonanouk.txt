Circle prices are different depending on if you use a debit card or credit card, the prices listed on BittyBot include these fees.
If you want to compare prices across different currencies i.e. Bitstamp USD versus Coinfloor GBP, hover over the price and it will tell you the percentage above BPI (Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index) you can then compare this percentage across exchanges. It won't take into consideration the exchange rate your bank will charge for the transfer but is a ball park figure of which is actually cheapest.

1. If you want to buy bitcoins in the UK using bank transfer do a search for "uk bank trans" on [BittyBot]( it will list all the places which accept UK bank transfer ordered by price.
2. Assuming you are trading for personal reasons you would have to declare capital gains to HMRC if you made more than the annual tax-fee allowance when you sell your bitcoins. 
3. No license is required to trade bitcoins on LocalBitcoins, but if you become a trader you would need to pay income tax on the profits in the same way as any other business as a sole trader.
You should not have any problems using HSBC to make personal purchases of bitcoins since they should not be aware, the companies which sell bitcoins avoid using the words like bitcoin/btc in the reference for this reason.
If you were to use your personal HSBC account to become a trader (i.e. high volume of transactions) then they might investigate and close your account, a lot depends on how careful you are with who you trade with and the volume.

I've heard stories of banks getting funny if the reference for the transfer contains "bitcoin" or "btc" but all exchanges nowadays avoid this so I would not expect you to have any problems.
