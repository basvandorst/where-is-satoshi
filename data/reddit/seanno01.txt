They used to be, definitely, and they're still a lot better than most others. But I've definitely seen standards slip recently. I'm not talking about this article or Bitcoin, just in general.
If you approach their reporting with an open mind you'll see they do their best to offer both sides of the story. But often there isn't two sides to a story so this approach introduces bias against the more credible side. A silly example that sticks in my head is when a study was released about cake in the workplace causing diabetes or something. 
The "two sides of the argument" were a) the study and a random NHS consultant offering advice, and b) a runner up from Bake Off from a few years ago who says a bit of cake at work won't hurt (I'm paraphrasing from memory).
The problem is this creates a biased argument because they're giving equal credance to a scientific study vs some randomers opinion, so deliberately or not they are now biased against the scientific study. People reading the article generally don't notice the difference in credentials, aren't challenged by the new information so generally pick the side they already agree with and now have a BBC article to back them up.
I know that's a silly example but you start seeing that tactic everywhere once you notice it, and it's so subtle it's hard to say if it's deliberate or just incompetance. The BBC are great but we still need to execute critical thinking when taking information from them, as with everyone else.
