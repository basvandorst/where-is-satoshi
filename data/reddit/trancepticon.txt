This shouldn't even be a question

May I ask how you like bitstamp? I made an account there but have yet to verify and deposit money into it. I would prefer if I could use bitstamp due to the stability and low fees etc but Im concerned that getting it set up might not be worth it compared to other alternatives such as vault of satoshi
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:53:17
Totally doable if only 1 or 2 tenants pay in bitcoin. Or hold on to the coins. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:53:07
around 440 euros.

this just in: he's blinking nervously, and it doesn't mean anything!
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:39:13
I don't know about that kind of information, I just know it's fast enough to not be annoying to me when I use it to browse sites.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:45:06
Care to elaborate on this? Im a total noob

Last one I watched was Tokyo Drift, I don't hate myself enough to watch more.

Some people are probably making a lot of money off of this. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:02:26
How generous of you :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:13:06
I know I'm a little late but do you happen to have any more info on this? Im Canadian and looking to do some trading, I'm not so sure I want to deal with cavirtex despite that it appears to be the most convenient and stable. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:41:50
Canada already did this, made life a lot easier for us and literally everyone is happy. Haven't heard a single person complain about getting rounded a couple cents up or down.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:35:23
Any other interesting websites? Im not necessarily looking for solar panel technology but renewable energy is an interest of mine and I am always on the lookout for reliable information sources
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:59:01
How about canada?

Good question. I am annoyed with this, as a total newcomer to bitcoin the first time I went to this subreddit the entire front page consisted of posts about how shitty mt gox was. That night, some lucky people bought bitcoins for ~100USD.  I badly wanted to buy some bitcoin, but every resource I could find still recommended buying through mt gox, so I put off buying bitcoin until I could understand more about the system. 
Had I watched Joe Rogan's podcast with Andreas Antonopolous when I intended to (the day it aired) and not a couple weeks later, I probably would have lost a bunch of money by now. I consider myself very fortunate to have delayed paying attention to bitcoin until after mt gox went down. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:20:45
Thanks. Ive heard they are dependable, but they charge an absurd 1.5% per trade.. not sure if I want to go with them or go with bitstamp
@_date: 2014-07-22 01:35:16
Check out Kraken, it's 0.5% which is not the best, but it's one of the lowest ones. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:44:29
Good for you! I'm still trying to figure out the best way to purchase some, I haven't got a lot of good information for canadian purchases. Im probably just too stupid to make it happen ;p
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:50:54
I'm looking into doing some bitcoin trading, I'm wondering if you would still recommend cavirtex? It's a couple of months since this post and it seem slike everything is changing all the time
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:40:24
Just wait til they actually figure out what bitcoin is ;p 
In all seriousness, this is great news. Im planning on buying some bitcoin soon, Im glad to hear banks aren't losing their shit just yet.
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:21:33
unless the morse code translates to 'Nervous' then nope, you have no evidence asshole!
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:32:32
It's not a guess, it's definitely intentional. They are being influenced by their investors to spread misinformation about bitcoin.

I find it a little hilarious that in response to a high-tech no-cost donation, he responds with what is basically a horse and buggy to your electric car.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:54:58
I'm looking into buying some but it seems like a lot of the information I am getting is outdated, and a lot of sites and guides are still recommending Mt Gox. My main issue is I am in Canada, and there seems to be considerably less options available compared to other countries such as the USA. I'm wondering if there is a website/company that you would recommend for canadians?
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:23:48
This is the type of thinking that gets us somewhere
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:30:46


Does this still work if I live in the west coast
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:01:07
In North America, a fucking ton of money. In another country, not nearly as much. Around 100,000$ will easily get you by in many countries for the rest of your life. Of course you can make a couple of low risk investments that will maintain the money value with less depreciation, and bitcoin will help with that. It all depends on how you want to live and where. It depends on what you want to do with your time.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:51:17
before today, last time i bought was around 420-450 euros

Latency on Tor isn't really that bad, it usually only takes me a few seconds for most pages, and a lot of marketplaces are faster. Some pages take up to around 30 seconds or so if I'm going to them the first time. I'm not that experienced with Tor so don't take my word too seriously, it's just what I've experienced lately.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:23:21
Im certainly interested in Cavirtex but quite frankly 1.5% is a lot of money to charge for each trade
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:27:46
It's just promoting an old broadcast, there's nothing revealing about that at all
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:29:53
Bitcoin Widget. I've heard from several places that there's some malware involved with it that can steal coins.
Personally I wouldn't trust coinbase for storage either, only trustable location for your bitcoins is cold storage.

I explained it to an aunt and she actually recieved it very well. Was impressed and got my hopes up, but a couple people at work now think im a retard.

Elon Musk seems like the kind of person to accept bitcoin payments too

Sometimes I wonder just how much influence an internet forum has

That's a good idea. I'll try it out tomorrow, thanks for the advice :)

Yup, the unfortunate thing is that apple is giving bitcoin a ton of bad publicity. But the more people that know about bitcoin the better, sooner or later they will find out what it is all about.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:37:52
Loaded with misinformation. It was hard to read that article
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:12:02
I'm digging up as much as I can :) So far people are saying Vault of Satoshi, and some say Cavirtex but the fee is pretty high at 1.5% at each trade, compared to 0.5% from VoS. I'm keeping in mind that I will have to buy bitcoin and then sell it, so the two trades will add up to 1% from VoS, or 3% from Cavirtex. 
It sounds like both are quite reasonable in regards to getting setup and verified, as well as customer service and general stability. I am personally a BMO user so the VoS is most likely going to be my pick, as this is the bank that they use as well That said, I'm still keeping an ear out for Bitstamp; I've heard a lot of good things from them too.

It's like a project where the blueprints and plans are generated by a computer instead of a person, and everyone always has the same copy?
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:30:18
Same for me except i invested a little earlier, lost about 2 grand now due to constant price crashing ever since i bought
@_date: 2014-10-20 23:51:18
They are also open to Canadians! I am very grateful as I can do some light purchasing and trading without giving them quite as much information as other exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:57:51
Its SO easy! You just get an app and account and start trading! Average joes dont really need to know much more than that if they're just buying a little, holding it and maybe making a transaction now and then. Yet im still getting blanks looks and confusion when i explain to anyone. Most frustrating is when people make jokes like 'you lost me at bitcoin'.
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:39:49
I've been spending mine and selling them because it's such a fucking financial loss to have any almost all of the time. Only time it's worth to have any is when you bought at rock bottom and it's doing its pathetic attempt at recovering. Yes we all know the technology is great but seriously the financial investment is so shitty.
@_date: 2015-04-18 23:35:50
You just never know. It's totally out of your hands and mine also. We just sit here staring at charts and reading news articles and saying, my god surely THIS time it's finally going to recover. Now that this state is accepting it, or now all these atm's have popped up it will finally not be taboo anymore and maybe just maybe people will buy some more and the price will climb. Moon 2015? Another spike? Always possible but we have to be honest in that the trend has always been a falling price with occasional spikes that make it worth having some coins. Totally unpredictable when those spikes occur, and that's what we're all waiting for. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:29:56
It's been down for a week, I get the feeling that much of those coins have been dumped before we even found out about it. It's not enough coins to really make a difference on price, or so I've been told.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:39:27
I bought around 600, let me know when we're back up there
