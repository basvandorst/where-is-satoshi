As a mod over at I would like to suggest the Charcot Marie Tooth Association. They are funding a cure for CMT, which is a family of rare neurological disorders.
I try to donate a little every year, but from what I can see they only accept paypal and bank transfers. I'm sure they would accept a donation in bitcoin if they were aproached with an offer though.

Is there a way to identify predatory journals outside of looking at the impact factor? I have a data set of about 5000 articles on the same topic from a lot of different journals and I'm looking for ways to isolate articles that are most likely bogus. At the moment I'm looking at impact factor, single authors, chinese names, and number of citations adjusted for the age of the article to compute some kind of score. Perhaps I could also factor in the foundation year of the journals them selves? Predatory journals are more common now than they used to be, right? I wish there were a list of shit journals.

Hmm, thanks for the insight. Do you know how I can check if an article was peer reviewed? Do I have to see if the journal accepts non-peer reviewed articles or is there another way?
I've also toyed with the idea of making an algorithm or neural network that can detect spelling mistakes and quantify those in the actual text of each paper. But then again if the authors don't have English as their native language this might cause more spelling errors without necessarily having an effect on the science.
If you can think of any other clever ways to approach this issue I'd love to hear it! My main goal is to try and predict article quality.

Freudian slip? ;)
