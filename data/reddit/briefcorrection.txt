Current, or close to current


Irrelevant; any


It continues to elude you that difficulty is only readjusted once every 2016 blocks.
If you had actually read my post, you would have known that my argument is that with a 99% drop in hash rate, blocks take 16.5 hours to be found, which means the difficulty readjustment wouldn't take place until 3.8 years into the future, since 16.5 hours x 2016 blocks = 3.8 years.
I can't wait to laugh further at you dumbfuck shitcoiners when the price gets down to ~$100 and all the big mining outfits (i.e. 90%+ of mining) turn off their machines 'temporarily' (like Cex.io) as electricity cost begins to exceed rewards.
Once that happens, you can kiss your 'investment' goodbye completely. I predict Bitcoins might be worth as much as $0.02 each as junk tokens - you know, like 1980s basketball cards. $0.02 x 14 million BTC would still be a respectable $380,000 market cap (more than 'FedoraCoin' at $20,000!)
It's good that there's been a brief retracement from $150 to $200, because my stomach needs a rest in between all the laughter I've had today and the laughter that's to come.

Schadenfreude my dear fellow
I don't want the vulnerable to suffer, but it's nice to watch smug fools get taken down a notch. Being brought back to reality is good for them anyway - perhaps it will teach them at the very least not to invest in 'get rich quick!' pump n dump pyramid schemes and be more cautious about goading others into following their choices.
I don't want pensioners to lose their retirement money, or for people to commit suicide because they've just bet their future away. Sadly though, this is what has happened and will continue to unfold, and the best thing one can do is bring an end to it as quickly as possible.
But there's no preventing the bagholders from losing now. Their money was cashed out in the form of Lamborghinis and mansions a long time ago. Now all that's left to fight over are the scraps.  So it's no use recommending one person or another to cash out, because that just means someone else ends up losing out - it's a zero-sum game. I do hope that crooks like Charlie Shrem or Erik Voorhees or Bruce Fenton end up with the losses though, rather than retirees and children and the like.

BTW, some advice for those fell for the whole 'dollar cost average' thing and other foolish rationalizations
I know you're probably feeling pretty hopeless right now, because now you WISH you could take a small loss like you could have before, but you can't and the outlook for Bitcoin isn't good
If you bought in at higher levels (i.e. $700+) there's no real point in selling right now. May as risk the remaining 10%, unless you've invested a real fuckton of money into this pump n dump pyramid scheme. But whatever you do, DON'T INVEST ANY MORE. Just leave it and hope for the best. Think about it - if you know the likelihood of it going back up is slim to begin with, why would you put even *even more* money into it? You've already got plenty of money in it to take advantage of any unforeseen rise.

Like I said, I don't have any skin in the game. The entertainment value is enough for me. I like watching and mocking dumb, greedy Bitcoiners getting their nose rubbed in the dirt.
Call me a cruel or sadistic man, but I put it to you that it's a lot less cruel than goading some poor and desperate retiree into dumping what little money he has into Bitcoin (yes, I actually saw this happen here just before the December 2013 peak). Or encouraging 14-year-old kids to get into bitcoin, I mean geez man..
But even if I was looking for money, I wouldn't trust the exchanges when it comes to shorting. No good making a fuckton of money shorting if it turns out you can't get your money out! I put my money elsewhere anyway, in sensible investments. I'm not looking to 'get rich quick', just get the best safe returns I can and enjoy life.

Nope, all it takes is for electricity cost to exceed rewards for most miners.
By my estimate, using precise data publicly available like electricity rates throughout the world and the efficiencies of various mining machines, that would be around ~$100.
Any outliers or rarities would form the remaining 1% of miners.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:21:44


Can't.. won't.. essentially the same thing, except using 'can't' makes plain the irrationality of your argument


First you argue that miners will continue mining at a loss until the next retarget, and now you claim that the difficulty will adjust downwards!
You can only have one or the other.


It's not stupid and short-sighted to turn off your mining machine if you are making a loss by leaving it on. It's the rational choice. 
Additionally, as I have previously explained, even if they choose to continue mining irrationally, it won't get them anywhere because if they all continue to mine they won't get a lower difficulty, and alternatively if only 1% of them continue to mine it'll take 3.8 years until a lower difficulty is reached.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:54:35
You forget one crucial thing: Block time.
As you say, increased BTC reward for remaining miners, but at lower value - BUT ALSO at a decreased rate of reward!
If half of miners leave, block time becomes 20 minutes, which means the reward rate halves.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:12:30


Which is what will likely happen
What mining machines can break even with the price being at $100 or less? You certainly can't find one if the electricity cost is $0.10/kWh.
At $0.043/kWh you'd be hard-pressed to find a miner that could break even just on electricity at $100/BTC, but then what if the price falls to $50/BTC? Then all miners would have to turn off their machines or run at an irrational loss. There's nothing to suggest the price won't or can't fall to that level, or even lower.
The price has just fallen from $270 to $150 in 48 hours. Who's to say a fall from the current $197 to $100 or $50 within 2 weeks is unlikely?
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:05:19
I suspect in saying that you're thinking that the new difficulty is based on the hash rate of the last block, but it's actually based on the hash rate of the previous 2016 blocks.
In fact, that's why difficulty is calculated over 2016 blocks, because otherwise you get a 'whipsaw' effect where the difficulty changes haphazardly each time and makes the network unusable (i.e. 4 second block, then a 18 hour block, then a 48 second block)
So say 90% of the blocks are mined at 100% current hash rate. Then the final 10% are mined at 1% hash rate. What you'd end up is the new difficulty requiring ~90% of the hash rate.
So while the scenario is perhaps more feasible because the loss would be widely distributed rather than falling on the shoulders of the remaining 1%, it wouldn't result in what's necessary
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:50:11
You think a 90%+ drop in hash rate is an 'extremely unlikely' scenario if the price falls to below $90?
Who do you think will continue to mine at that price, considering that no mining machine in existence today can break even on electricity cost at that price?
Or do you just think it 'extremely unlikely' that the price could fall to $90 or less?
How can you do a hard fork without resetting the difficulty to '1' and allowing Lucky Joe and co. to mine 50,000 BTC in a matter of minutes? Do you really believe that developers and users would be able to even come to a consensus on that?

I've already addressed it in a short response already:


I've been a miner myself in the past. No serious investment, I just happened to upgrade my PC with a HD7970 in June 2013 by sheer luck of timing (just before the altcoin boom). I'd also mined previously with a HD5770 I had
In mining altcoins I saw many instances of attempted hard forks to solve a collapse in hash rate. Often the reason was that there would be huge pools that would mine the most profitable altcoin, and then they would leave once it became unprofitable leaving only a small fraction of the hash rate left but with a high difficulty. 
What I saw was not pretty. The above concern I describe is one such disaster that would occur - first few lucky guys mine tons of blocks because difficulty is so low at first, and then you have the 'whipsaw' effect (1st block really easy, 2nd really hard, 3rd really easy, 4th block really hard, etc.) until difficulty gets up to the right level.
And that's just one thing that could go wrong.
Attempting a hard fork would be opening pandora's box. What would make it an infinitely more sweaty experience for the Bitcoin developers is that there is a ton of money invested in Bitcoin.

That's part of the point though, it's why dollar cost averaging is foolish - because you're just digging a deeper hole for yourself in the hope that eventually you'll have made the right bet
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:13:31
Yes, I should have taken time into account
Still, in that scenario it would take 140 days which is almost 5 months to get the difficulty down to 10%, which is far too long to have a network ground to a halt. (discounting the max 75% decline per retarget). Then that 1% would have to mine for another 140 days to get the block times down to normal from 1.66 hours.
The cost to mine at a loss for those initial 1811 blocks would be substantial. Using a hash rate of 300 million GH/s, and assuming 1GH/1W efficiency on average, and $0.10/kWh, that's $8.6 million just in electricity costs (minus $2.2 million in rewards if $50/BTC)
It's essentially the same as 'What if the sudden hash rate decline occurs just before the difficulty retarget?', except in this case miners willingly lose a few million dollars to get near the end of the retarget
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:50:15
You forget that most miners had to pay for their machines (they cost up to $15,000 each), as well as possibly rent and associated fees if they are a warehouse operation like OP.
The thing is, it doesn't make rational sense for any individual miner to operate at a loss. Why operate at a loss? Why not just turn off the machine when electricity cost exceeds rewards, and wait until rewards increase before turning on the machine again?
Perhaps there will be some Bitcoin die-hards out there who will take one for the team.. they will make up the remaining 1%. I'll bet you though that large mining companies and Mr. Chang in his Guangzhou warehouse are more interested in making fiat than in the success of Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:31:02


That's rubbish
You say you have Cointerra Terraminers running on electricity costing $0.043/kWh
Not turning off your machines once it goes below the break even point of $90/BTC would be irrational
If the hash rate decreased within a two week window by 99% or even 90% (what you would expect if electricity cost exceeds rewards for even the most efficient mining machines), then the difficulty readjustment would never come (well, not for months/years)
@_date: 2015-01-15 11:34:41


Yes, your reward doubles, but you only get that reward half as regularly, as the difficulty remains the same until the next retarget.
Not to mention the price has likely declined, because what else would cause a sudden 99% decrease in hash rate?
So normally:
0.25 BTC reward @ 10 minutes @ $200/BTC = $7,200/day
But then the price declines to $100 and the hash rate decreases by 99% leaving you the only one of the hundred left mining:
25 BTC reward @ 16.67 hours @ $100/BTC = $3,600/day
Note how even if the price remains the same, the reward does not increase upon what it was. You get the same amount of BTC per day in either case (36 BTC).
What will increase it as you describe is a difficulty retarget to match the lower hash rate. But as I argue, if the hash rate declines by 99%, then blocks take 16.67 hours to be found, and since the time to difficulty retarget is 2016 blocks: 16.67 hours x 2016 blocks = 3.8 years.

Your logic here can be reduced to 'It would be terrible for this to happen, therefore it can't happen'
Do you have any idea of the amount of money that would need to be injected to bring it back from the brink?
Where would all this mining power even come from? Would companies put out ads advertising money for people's unwanted mining machines? It takes months to plan, manufacture and deliver machines - and it would take years probably for the amount you would require! And yet all of this would need to be achieved in what.. 3 weeks perhaps? Because I can't see confidence in the system lasting very long if the network comes to a virtual standstill.
And even if they do manage to do that, that won't magically push the price up - you'll have to keep mining at a loss, perhaps bringing the difficulty down a notch at a time (an interesting thing a commenter said recently that I didn't know is that difficulty can only decrease by 75% each adjustment - if I read it right)
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:22:31


There's nothing complicated about it at all.
Electricity cost exceeds rewards, therefore miner turns off machine and waits for rewards to increase. Simple as that.
The fact is that there is not a single mining machine in existence right now that can break even at $100/BTC with electricity being $0.10/kWh.
Even for you, with $0.043/kWh and some of the most efficient mining machines, the point at which mining becomes irrational for you is $90/BTC.
If the price were to go to $50/BTC (let's face it, with what has happened in the past 48 hours, it's starting to look *likely*), then even with a heavily discounted electricity price such as $0.03/kWh and the best mining machine available right now, electricity cost would exceed rewards.
Damn bro, I don't have any skin in the game and even I've thought about this deeper than you. It's no wonder Bitcoin is going in the shitter.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:00:53


Why would you expect there to be half the miners left?
There would hardly be a miner left (if any) that doesn't have electricity cost exceeding rewards
