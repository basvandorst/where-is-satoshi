For the clueless arriving later, the title refers to this post. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:06:08
I agree. I've been here before and it's a phenomenally hard task. we'll keep expecting great things for you. Why don't you post on other subs as well?

I just checked and it's  in Finance. Great job! Wish I was there when I was 16.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:07:44
That's how reddit works honestly. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:35:49
It's effective marketing actually. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:06:52
I showed it to the poster of the other app and she took it in good humor anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:10:16
is not 16, the one who posted the other app is.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:16:14
Is it that hard to believe though?
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:03:40
No this works out well.

Dude the daily fluctuation of any cryptocurrency is far more than fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:51:16
Ah I get it.  Similar to r/HailCorporate I guess?

How would you know about the git commits? That seems strange to get from decompiling an app?

I think I should be more clear with terms, a true unrestricted market has a chance of running into collusion and monopolistic behaviour. There can be various kinds of market failures, information asymmetry and so on. To combat that and create a more 'ideal' (for lack of better term, I have not been studying this subject for too long) we need to deal with that to create the market of choice that people want. So yes, not really a 'free' market in that sense.
And yes, regulation has that effect, noy denying that nor trying to defend it. Regulations can be broad and can have a variety of negative effects. Not all regulations create bubbles, they can have a variety of other negative impacts (shortages, recessions, stagflation and so on). I'm arguing that some small amoung of few certain regulations are needed to allow a market with 'ideal' conditions where consumers get choice and healthy competition exists.

Correct. I was approaching it as the most interesting moment for bitcoin. A lot of people started buying them, and panicked later, leading to where we are now.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:55:19
Depends. Some regulation allows free markets (anti-monopoly, restrictions on labour union), other restrict it. Many economists argue that some amount of regulation is necessary to allow a free market.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:44:10
I mean, they don't like Bitcoin specifically as a currency due to its speculative-bubble crowd around it. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:27
Most often they form out of regulation. Agreed, but not all of them form by regulation. Some from out of Economies of scale, capital barriers, technological barriers and so on. These are much smaller in amount, but exist.
Regulations can have a whole host of nasty effects other than bubbles, though I agree that most bubbles are caused by this. Sometimes they surprisingly create nice effects (normal working hours, correcting negative externalities of consumption/production).
Also despite a free market, there still exist imbalances like asymetrical information, negotiating power skewed in one side etc. So not much, but minimal and targeted intervention is needed to correct that. Though there are many systems of thought that advocate against this since this can risk going the other way very easily and the advantages may outweigh these negative outcomes in a no intervention environment.

How did you gain access to this?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:39:57
Perhaps, I remember when people were wondering if it'll hit 100k and beyond.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:40:39
The app's name or any branding does not seem to really be there, so most people won't really have any way of knowing. This seems pretty innocent to me (though I can't say the same for OP's other posts :P)
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:27:17
Underrated comment.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:30:17
For example countries with weaker regulation have far more inhumane working hours (ex. China, India, Bangladesh etc.)
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:02:15
For all of these, other fiat currencies are far, far more popular and used. I can use USD in many countries because of this.
@_date: 2018-02-10 08:57:50
I think it's probably the generation after that actually.

The profile picture at the top is the same as harshita, did you gain access to that account? Did they leave the password lying around?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:37:32
India does not like Bitcoin but likes blockchain as far as I know. It can have interesting applications in governance, I do hope it goes through.
