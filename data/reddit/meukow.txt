My business runs via PayPal and most of my finances are there.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:44:21
Any tips for me on using it?
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:46:09
Interesting, have you used this site and how legit is it?
What's the fee when compared to buying from lets say Coinbase with credit card?

When those guys from Facebook yelling Tulips buy, then you're close to exhausting the new money. And they will buy, as soon as mBTC becomes the new BTC, aka, obtainable.

Look into Determinism. Basically everything you do is NOT an error, it's "fate". The decisions you made were the decisions you had to make with the amount of information and experience you had back then. Basically, if you sold too early, that was "fate" and dwelling on it is pointless because that's what the past you was "forced" to do with the set of information and mindset you had back then.
Thinking how "stupid was I" is not a healthy mindset as you weren't stupid, you simply acted the best you could with the circumstances back then, aka, back then it made the MOST sense. Now you have more information but that cannot be applied to past you.

DO NOT TRADE WITH THIS PERSON, SCAMMED FOR 20 EUROS WORTH.
 &lt;PROOF
HIS SKYPE IS: fitnessregiment
Deal was that I will buy a game on G2A.com for him with my Skrill balance and he will pay me in PayPal, never happened and I lost 20 euros.

Can I get my private keys from Electrum then?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:37:27
I already have a chunk of BTC in my possession, I just never understood the wallets, until now. Lol.
Can you explain me this thing, I have an electrum wallet and I was told to save the "Seed" - are those my private keys just in actual words or are those a "password" to enter electrum which has my private keys?
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:48:16
Does that mean that Electrum still has my keys and is prone to lets say hacking, but I also have them in paper?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:25:35
So I should buy it on exchange or send it from myself, and then where do I make a paper wallet? Can you recommend?

Your fallacy is that you think that marketcap = real money. That's not how it goes. Marketcap does NOT equal the amount of "real money" invested. IIRC at peak we had about 8 billion of real money invested into Bitcoin, which is, pocket change compared to any other major asset.

Excuse me but someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
Tether company loaned $600 mil to Bitfinex with a 6.5% interest. They will repay it back eventually. The problem here is that if everyone wanted to convert their Tether to USD and withdraw immediately, they'd be screwed.
Isn't this how our current banking system works. If everyone on Earth wanted to spend their funds that are in the banks right this moment, that would not be possible because it's not backed by real currency (cash + assets).
It's wrong when crypto does it but normal when banks do it?

I do accept it as a merchant. Bitpay gateway allows you to convert the payments into FIAT instantly, the moment a purchase was made. You can keep the Bitcoin, like I do.
Volatility drops with adoption...I and many others are hoping for adoption, obviously.

The private key is the seed, right?
Too bad this app doesn't have my total BTC worth in USD, I love checking that out on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:27:49
I just moved to Electrum...eh.
Question: What if Electrum gets hacked, do I lose coins?
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:28:17
Because it's scarce.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:32:16
I installed Electrum on my phone, made a wallet, wrote the seed and PIN to a paper, stored it.
Sent the BTC to the wallet.
What else can I do to improve security and not lose my coins? 2FA? Because I don't see any 2FA option.
Also what happens if I delete my app right now and reinstall, I just enter the seed and I have my coin again? Where is that coin after all?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:08:23
1. Don't have that sadly
2. Did that
3. Where exactly is that you're talking about? I got access to Coinbase, I just cannot move my bitcoin or remove authy.

Came in to reply this. Gold is staying here, for a while. It might take a hit in near future if crypto becomes less volatile.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:29:53
Cheers mate!

That was in between my phone change.
