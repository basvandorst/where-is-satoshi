Shouldn't be excedingly difficult to create a dictionary file with what you think the master password is and then try to crack it. Since it's an online aervice they may have perameters like only 5 guess a minute before being locked out for x tjme though.

I mean, you don't talk properly so I can understand how somebody might be confused with what you're trying to explain. Probably part of your problem is trying to use logos to appeal to somebody who is quite obviously more persuaded by pathos. You then come on a forum that is fumdamentally logos and try to use pathos to influence us. You're misled.

Find the average difficulty adjustment. If it's 4% every 2 weeks project that into how many weeks until 2140. You'll likely want to do it by 52 first to get the yearly average iincrease.
Now calculate miner efficiency from bitmain on a yearly average. Price of equipment and electricity are particularly important. Project that into 120 years in the future.
Take the network hash divided by the s9. Multiply that by the kwh for electricity and by the total price for current capital and expense for 100% of market share.
Take those numbers and scale them across your difficulty and efficiency curves for 100% of market share over the next 100 years or so.
Simple math really. However, that's assuming future growth at current rates. I suspect quantum computing will accelerate all those numbera drastically due to developing better binary architecture etc.

Put it in a water proof vault with a gps location device. Take scuba classes and become advanced in deep sea diving and then one day rent a boat to dump your safe in the ocean. Give one of the 2 keys required to open the safe to somebody else. Give the combination of it to another. This is the only true way of storing a seed safely.

She can commit criminal felonies and misdemeanors handling top secret classified information and still get off clean to the justice system and most of the general public. You think a few btc addresses would even phase her? Lol
