Thanks for taking the time to write this.

I haven't used Mycelium myself (I hear good things about it though) so I'm not really sure what options it provides. But use encryption where possible / choose strong passwords. And use two-factor authentification everywhere you can (on exchanges, websites). Take it a step at a time. Maybe look into 'paper wallets' eventually if you plan on storing bitcoins for the long-term. Enjoy!
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:59:48
Yeah, it's working for me now. Thanks for sharing.

First reaction: DropBox? Ugh!
I'll check it out. But the site is down now. Did you try to run a fork bomb?
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:32:48
Enough with the "Bits" already... What's wrong with uBTC?

I also received a 0.002 tip from onename.io - but I got an email about it. It's a "welcome" tip from the OneName team.

I didn't visit the link either. Perhaps it tried to get you to update Flash?
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:35:03
I also got that CampBX phishing email (but my email is not associated with MtGox)  ..
@_date: 2014-08-23 10:33:59
Thank you :) Appreciated! (I was away so I didn't thank you earlier.)
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:10:32
Same here. And the reply-to address is the same as used here: 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:06:28
Not obviously. Possibly. Probably exploited a vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:06:18
Hmm. Interesting, thanks, I had never seen that blockchain.info page. I guess so, perhaps it only works with new wallets. Anyways, glad you got it working finally. :)
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:57:42
That doesn't sound right. Have you tried the Kraken thread on BTalk? 
@_date: 2014-02-13 02:02:21
I don't think you can import a wallet.dat file directly into blockchain.info (they aren't compatible). The import page says:












You best option would probably be to use the output from pywallet.py utility.

When you receive a payment in the Android app, the dialog in English says "Dismiss" but in Spanish it is translated as "Reject". For someone who knows what it's supposed to do is fine, but my friend who I recently helped get set up with a wallet was very hesitant to click on it - he thought he was rejecting the payment.

They've been at level before a few months back. I guess it just really depends on advertisers.
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:17:01
so repeat. much lawyer. wow.
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:48:08
I'm getting a bunch of these too.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:48:47
And nothing happened on Bitfinex.. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along...
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:37:51
This would have been funnier published tomorrow.

 unless you can't use them for geographical reasons.

Welcome. Remember to be pro-active in your security (make backups, use 2-factor authentication, ...) and you'll learn a lot in the process.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:20:32
Do you use OneName.io?
@_date: 2014-08-12 11:14:02
That is pretty neat. I didn't know about it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:27:20
Yeah.. good article. I'm still pro-Bitcoin, though his advice towards the end is "stay away". There are right and wrong reasons for being into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:43:23
I get your point, but "bits" seems too ambiguous.
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:12:19
(Somewhat related:) At least developers can receive Bitcoin through  - and maybe also  (dunno, haven't tried this one).
@_date: 2014-09-03 11:59:24
Awesome! I received the stickers in the mail today! I love them. Thank you BitStickers.net for the giveaway (and for shipping international)!

Backup your wallet.dat file. Upgrade everything else.
(On blockchain.info: How are you trying to import it?)

@_date: 2014-02-11 22:01:28
Maybe hubris. But I use them and they are a real solid exchange. Good for them!
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:50:15
Just gonna say I agree.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:40:40
yeah.. it's odd. :?

@_date: 2013-12-04 10:47:54
I've also just withdrawn (BTC) without any problems. Given though, it wasn't a lot (~0.015 BTC).
