There is no such thing as a terrible year for bitcoin prices. As long as bitcoin adoption picks up, then we should be happy!

try to get donations to rent a billboard about the good aspects of bitcoin. also point out that cash is currently used for the exact same thing and no one has a problem with that.

why was she talking to the table?
@_date: 2014-11-18 03:54:33
your wallet and any wallet that get those coins. idk, i just don't trust the government.

You could also say, ok its a scheme. but in the bitcoin scheme there are not wars and people being killed as you see in the petro-dollar scheme.

Is this really new information to anyone?

The federal reserve was modeled after the weimar bank in germany around 1912. The two systems are pretty much identical in function

These coins are tainted. The feds will track their spread via the block chain.

what made him an idiot was how he scoffed at the idea of wanting to be paid in something other than dollars.

I asked my former employer to pay me in bitcoin in early 2013. the HR guy laughed and said it sounded stupid. fast forward a couple month when bitcoin was over 1000... all his buddies on online hunting forums were talking about it and he came to ask me about it. that guy is was and probably still is an idiot.

And what about now?!
 50% drop, you think anyone is going to buy in now?! Haha
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:15:57
based on what exactly?

FTA: "before correcting upwards"
HHAHAHAHAHHA that's a good one.

Its not about being able to spend it on laffy taffy. It is more based on peer to peer payments in cases like eBay, that would bring great credibility to Bitcoin.
Also the mass speculation is what is making Bitcoin fluctuate so wildly, so how is it that Bitcoin will stabilize before people stop speculating and use it properly?
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:00:46
if speculation out paces legitimate purchasing, then bubbles will form.

Well I have some land to sell you!

And those could immediately be banned from accessing networks in the US. Are you being willfully dense?
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:28:23
THIS. I wish people would use it for its intended purpose instead of all the rampant speculation. It would be great if it took off but these crashes really scare people off. I guess we really can't have anything nice.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:58:40
its 100% of the employers i have.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:18:08
So when bitcoin goes up 500% it is growth, but if it drops 50% it is skullduggery? You people need to realize that speculation is killing the currency.

Bitcoin could also reach $0.00 by tomorrow. This type of rampant guess work is very irritating.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:08:22
Explain how it would "impossible" to enforce if the people mining are broadcasting their IP to every node. Do you understand networking basics?
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:20:30
No, you want to trade in Federal Reserve Notes, you will comply to the FINCEN rules, no matter where you are in the world.

You can't force banks to do business with anyone or anything. You don't have to do business with the bank. Vote with your dollar.

I asked my employer to pay me in bitcoin in Oct. last year, they didn't agree...
