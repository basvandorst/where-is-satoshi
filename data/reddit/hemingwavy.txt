So you're saying it gets less profitable to provide the computing power needed to sustain itself as time goes on. That seems like an excellent design for a serious currency.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:47:36
So what inherent does it possess? Apple stocks are worth money because they're a part of a company that has assets. Bitcoin is worth money because people think it will be worth more money later.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:15:39
So you're telling me more or less bitcoins are being created now? Are transaction fees meant to rise to account for this and encourage people to keep mining?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:27:11
You don't know what triggers hyperinflation do you?
Also that's not inherent value.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:54:04
Should have clarified. It's utter shit as a currency. The only thing it's good for is hoping other people will pay more for it than you and it lacks any sort of intrinsic value. It is worthless in every sense except people might want it more than you. On top of that, it's not even good at being worth a lot of money because of how inefficient it is to run and the fact that the majority of the computer power relies on government subsidies.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:20:51
So it gets less profitable as time goes out with charging greater fees. Like I said.

If you have those things you probably have a bank account.

Bitcoin is horrific for storing money. It's massive fluctuations in value mean you can't store money without risking losing large amounts.

They're not going to talk to you in ten years. The bit where the guy asks you what your salary is, is him telling you to go fuck yourself. He doesn't want to know your salary, he thinks you're boring and smug and only message about bitcoin.

Thank god you didn't accuse me of listening to JP. That would have really hurt my feelings.
It's fine if you think the government should step in and provide a way to limit free speech which is harmful. It just runs counter to everything Peterson has ever said.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:04:45
If you buy Apple shares then that means you own a small part of Apple and that has value because they have iPhones and contracts. Bitcoin has value because you think someone will give you more money for it than you paid for it .

Why? 
They're all dead so that'll be hard for them. I also don't live in London any more. Also my grandfather left his country of origin because they would have sent him to a concentration camp otherwise. I feel like he wouldn't have sent
 me to Nazi Germany. 
How can you in anyway feel like you belong to a superior race than anyone else? You're borderline intellectually disabled.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:59:23
He's dead. Do you know what being dead means? It means you can't do shit anymore. 
I've been to Auschwitz. I don't want to go back. It was cold and at least they didn't gas me. I think if it was filled with Nazis it would be even worse.
I don't think you really get how vile the Nazis were. My grandfather fled the country he was born in so he and his descendents could survive and not die in concentration camps where they would be beaten and gassed to death. 
Your shitty suggestion that he'd send me back to one of these camps because I don't give a shit about what religion Muhammad is down the street just like I don't give a shit what religion Shirley across the street is reflects poorly on you. You come across as one of the most degenerate, dumb pieces of shit I've ever met. I think that's a fair assessment of the kind of person that would suggest my grandfather would put me in a concentration camp because I can live in peace with people I may disagree with.
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:36:09
What kind of degenerate moron are you? That's not what gaslighting means. 
Literally the only positive value you have is that you're going die earlier because you smoke.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:19:45
Given your argument  is that we should keep Sweden for people like you but your a moronic degenerate why would that improve anything?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:33:28
Yeah. You're human vermin.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:20:34
Can you let me know how that storm front is coming in?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:32:18
It's April you fucking moron. London has had two more murders than NYC. I used to live two blocks from a mosque in London. 
Don't reproduce.
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:23:41
So you're such a fucking moron that don't understand third world refers 
to a country that didn't align with either the soviet union or USA but feel confident enough to make claims about it?
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:26:38
Mmmm just no. The government has been making people say stuff forever. Lose a libel lawsuit and they're probably going to make you apologise.
You also don't have to use pronouns so it's really just pronouns you can't say.
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:33:31
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:06:04
Nah he's a hardcore traditionalist who wants to move society back 100 years socially.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:36:58
JP isn't a lawyer.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:00:45


JP takes data from unrelated fields behind a shed before beating them into submission and then clumsily warping them to fit his argument. Why do you think biologists and historians hate him?
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:15:33
No you use your speech to counter their words then the marketplace of ideas comes into play.
@_date: 2018-12-30 12:46:41


Which is why his papers are widely cited and o- they've never been considered relevant and are just generally kind of considered interesting in that he's managed to contort sources to come up with this out there theory? Well then.
Now he just sells self help books.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:12:39
I was under the impression that the answer to speech you disagreed with was more speech. It actually turns out that you use the government to suppress speech and force others to speak in a certain way.
Imagine being as foolish as me. It's why JP supports C-16 which provides minorities being discriminated against the ability to have the government suppress speech and force others to speak in a certain way.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:29:24
C-16 only applies to you as a private citizen if you're inciting hate. Do you regularly incite hate? Peterson was misinformed as he often is outside of his sphere or he deliberately misinterpreted it to rile his audience up.


@_date: 2018-12-31 05:41:46
It's a common response by scam victims to deny they were taken advantage of. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:03:02
Any man who can unironically say the words post-modernist Marxist is a new and rare breed of stupid, you should be scared of.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:33:13
If you lose a libel case the government is probably going to compel you to apologise.
The government forces companies to print warning labels on products.
The government forces companies that falsely advertise goods to print corrections.
You don't have to use pronouns so under Peterson's incorrect interpretation it still doesn't compel speech. It doesn't apply to misgendering someone as a private citizen.
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:23:00
JP is some guy only eats beef and has fucked up his diet so badly that when he drank apple cider he couldn't sleep for 25 days.
People heard about this and thought he sounded like a man who gave good advice so gave him $60k a month.
