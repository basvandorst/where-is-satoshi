Note that this only works if your target address has been spent from in the past. So, you would start by taking a previous transaction that spent coins at the target address you want to steal from. Call the signature in this transaction S, and the data that it signed T. So S is a valid signature for sha256(T). (This is how ECDSA works, the hash of the message is signed, not the message itself because the message itself is too long). Now, create a new transaction that sends coins to an address you control, call this new stealing transaction T1. Abuse the SHA-256 exploit to modify T1 such that its hash is equal to sha256(T). Now take the old valid signature, S, and add it to this new transaction. Boom, you've created a new valid transaction spending bitcoins you didn't previously have the private key for.

Well I was working from the assumption in the comments I replied to, which was that the NSA had a secret exploit / backdoor in sha256
@_date: 2016-08-15 22:11:41
Well, given a backdoor in SHA256 couldn't they forge any signature based on the hash of the document to be signed? Including ECDSA?

Oh, sorry if I was unclear: for web wallets, the full blockchain is never stored in the browser. However, the service that you are using almost certainly stores the full blockchain on *their* servers.
An exchange and a web wallet are identical in this respect (this service stores the blockchain on their servers, but your browser doesn't have to).
A full client is where you yourself store the full blockchain to get the maximum security and benefit from the bitcoin network. This is where you are a fully participating node in the network. 
Actually, only some web wallets generate and store the keys on their servers. Some of them do clever things with encryption where your browser generates the keys, and the web wallet only stores a version encrypted with your password, so they can't steal your bitcoin.

Almost all Web wallets store none. Only a couple mobile wallets are fully validating SPV nodes (they store the headers only), the rest of the mobile wallets store none. Some desktop wallets are SPV, some store the full blockchain. All exchanges store the whole blockchain. 
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:34:27
Yeah exchanges with lots of coins available like poloniex have to store potentially terabytes of blockchain data for all the currencies they support. Happy to help =)

The blockchain greatly amplifies the butterfly effect.  If I had sent just one transaction differently,  every block since then would have a totally different hash, miners would get slightly different payouts, and so on. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:22:51
If a miner could produce smaller blocks and get more fees they would do it. We don't see any miners consistently producing 0.5MB blocks, do we? If the block size were increased by, say, 10%, miners would see more fees, not less. Miners could always produce blocks smaller than the limit... but they don't. Because it's not profitable.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:40:48
That's for different reasons. Mining a completely empty block, with no transactions, provides objectively less profit than mining a block with fee-paying transactions. You see mostly completely empty blocks, or completely full blocks nowadays. I can't speak to why a miner would do that, but in terms of whether smaller blocks or larger blocks provide more fees to miners, empty blocks are objectively the worst option.
My point was that if miners could make more money by making smaller blocks, they would. But they don't.
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:59:07
I see that. There is probably an ideal block size, perhaps it lies between 1 and 8MB. Call it 4MB. Miners could limit their blocks to 4MB and make more money. Do they?
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:18:13
I see. It's not about individual miner choice, it's about everyone knowing everyone else is limited. Like the Prisoner's Dilemma. Makes sense, thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:56:15
Low fees due to larger blocks gives miners more fees overall than high fees due to smaller blocks.

Isn't it 256? secp*256*k1, sha256. Where did you get 512 from?
@_date: 2015-07-08 02:06:10
Yes, either the transaction will go through or it won't, there is no middle ground (your coins can't be held in "limbo" forever).

They said Dogecoin has fixed supply, when it actually doesn't 
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:59:49
Why would it be hard to spend? In a simple example of money in a 2/3 multisig address, if you have access to 2 out of the 3 private keys, you could spend from the address no matter which network it was on, correct? 
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:04:01
Why'd you thank them? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:45:46
Yes. Since Litecoin and bitcoin use the same prefix byte for P2SH addresses, those two addresses were generated from the same private key, and can be spent with the same private key.

Actually, Electrum doesn't send the list of all the user's addresses to the server, that would be insecure and the user would have no privacy. It actually uses an interesting data structure called a bloom filter.

In almost all cases,  yes.  But when a two groups of miners have competing chains,  the fork can go on for hundreds of blocks. This happened in March of either 2013 or 2014.
