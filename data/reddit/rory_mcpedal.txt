Thanks! Looks good, I'll give it a try/

Right... and flags don't wave on the moon, and dogs licking babies doesn't cause autism. What was your point, other than name-calling?

What's also fake? You didn't say.
So, you're a conspiracy theorist? Or just mad about something? I still don't get your point. You're obviously angry about something, but I'm really having trouble getting anything meaningful from your posts. 
I've been whiling my ass for a long time, so don't be too quick to judge. Also, you might make less spelling mistakes if you calm don't and don't pound the keyboard so furiously ;)

I sold on Thursday (not panicked, just took a chance) and then bought back at the bottom of the yo-yo. Made a sweet gain. Of course, had I just left it where it was (in ETH) I would have made a bit more by now. But not losing is the name of the game, right?

Guys, this is totally legit.
Also, jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to melt steel girders and flags don't wave on the moon. Finally, despite having very low-levels of antigens, pretty much any vaccination will cause instant autism, but having a dog lick a baby's face, or a baby licking a shopping cart at WalMart doesn't for some reason. /s (in case it wasn't obvious)

OK, sorry if I wasn't clear. I wasn't really thinking of an attack, per se. Right now, for example, we don't have one entity able to manipulate the ledger in that way (unless I'm mistaken). But right now, there is a number of entities who have enough hash power to make lots of money for themselves while effectively making it a losing proposition for anyone else (except a new big player) to mine. Then, if those entities get together, they could effectively put pressure on the community as a whole, as the boys from BUtcoin are doing now.
 
Changing the POW stops that, but then that solution requires developers working to the same end, thus creating a de facto "Bitcoin Council of Elders" scenario, and again creating a central power base.
I guess, in a broader, more philosophical sense, is there any way that BTC can ever be free of centralized power, and thus keep from becoming just another currency with all the inherent political and economic entanglements? I know that's a pretty big question, so don't hesitate to answer, "How the Hell should I know?"

Makes sense. Thanks for taking the time to explain. Cheers!

Actually, after reading these tweets, I hope this clown and his "investment" does (figuratively) burn to the ground. What a twat. If there's one thing that BTC doesn't need more of, IMHO, it's greedy corporatist arseholios and lawyers. Might as well join a club full of child molestors and animal-torturers. Ok, maybe that's a bit far... but not much.

They must be getting nervous. Wonder when this will start happening here in Canada. Our banks aren't known for their high ethical standards and adherence to the ideals of fair play.

We already have mining centralization which, as you point out, will lead to interference. Likely not only from governments but also from anyone with enough economic clout (like we're seeing right now).
Question from a blockchain newb: Is there any way, now or in the future, to stop that? Does the economic model or the technical model of Bitcoin provide any, even theoretical, way to keep mining from becoming centralized? That is, won't there always be someone with Jihanian money to buy a warehouse and a bunch of rigs and just make it a waste of time for any mere mortals to participate?

Were you able to get in on Dash last month before it set course for the moon? I wasn't :( Then it hit $40 and I said, "Wahhh, it's too late" and did nothing.

What's called auto-correct? Are you saying that auto-correct changes wiping to whiling? That's one weird auto-correct you got there, Fella. Anyway, you didn't answer any of my questions. Can you read them ok?
