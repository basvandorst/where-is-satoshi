Lol, ok cool. Actually you can pay in bitcoin. I have "other" set for my etsy shop and mention bitcoin and litecoin as payment options in "about". But I'll put it right on my listing. Glad you pointed that out, thanks! Here's my Bitcoin Receive address: 1Q9Dm2odGdMdvEv4iSNViKbuYMJMRkwGaH

You sure can. Please look at Ned's post below. It would be 0.058695 BTC if shipping to the US.

The black parts are actually really thick plastic, not printed or silk screened. The whole thing is 3D printed and takes a few hours to make. Because of the 3D printing it does look a bit rough and not perfect like something manufactured. Here's more of a side view where you can see the thickness and the printed layers:

I test ran one for over 3 days straight once. It will dim if you run it like that. But if you turn it on for a while each day it runs a pretty long time. I could make it with a plug but that would increase cost and it limits where it can be sold around the world due to voltage, adapters, etc. And it limits where it can be placed. But I'm working on a Commercial version that runs on AA batteries and that one can run for weeks I'm sure.
