I'm not sure your intentions, you could be a bot, but anyway invidious is a youtube front end wrapper used to avoid tracking and ads of youtube.

There are many bitcoin extremists who propound the philosophy not to keep anything on exchanges. If it's a large exchange like coinbase or gemini, the risk of losing your funds is small, however, if the exchange is small and sketchy, it's a bad idea to store money on it.
Another reason bitcoin enthusiasts propound the idea to keep coins secure in a wallet with your own private key, you are realizing the philosophy behind bitcoin.
The technology is still new, eventually we'll see major improvements in the usability of bitcoin, like immediate transactions and easier to use addresses.

'cept now the entire stock market is manipulated by groups inside the federal govn't, many large business are now privately held vs publicly traded, much more global interaction going on between nation states, many new variables are new to the equation.. it's hard to generalize on economics. recession or no recession in the immediate future, bitcoin is not going anywhere

Well... yes.. except...it's a different market than one like 1980's when I had to coordinate with and pay a stockbroker to place that option for me, now me instanatly and feelessly clicks a button on my phone and can put a call option ... . we be entering new and harder to predict territory, we can't use past economic trends from the past to judge as well HOWEVER It's anyone's guess whether the stock market will catastrophically plunge like it did in 2008, 1987, . . . 1929 again, however, economy is still going to go UP and DOWN but it's gonna get more volatile , we in a post scarcity economy.. it's all a big masquerade now and BTC isnm't gonna go anywhere now it has da notoriety and da technology ( actually btc is slow as hell can we please make it instant FFS ) but da good news is yacan't even block it thanks to a new satellite and cheaply available hardware, oh and free software too
