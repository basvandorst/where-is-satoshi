Apple was considered to have rock solid encryption, you can now buy a box for $15,000 that will unlock any Apple device plugged into it. (technically only available for law enforcement) I imagine you could find a similar software or service for Rar if you were so inclined.

eh, they're very protective of that software. No one really knows what it's capable of but it appears to be really effective. For all we know it could be unpacking each rar, unencrypting and scanning them. Considering Apples security can be breached pretty easily now (if you've got $15,000 burning a hole in your pocket anyway) I don't think it's unreasonable to think that dropbox can crack rar encryption.

Wow, false equivalency much? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:27:53
That sounds about right, I know it's less than 10K for sure.

You do know Youtube has an algorithm and an entire team of humans whose sole job is to hunt down and remove CP right? Also corporations running a server have different responsibilities and liabilities than an individual downloading stuff to their personal computer.

And your evidence that it's fake is.....? Like I said, people have been talking about the possibility of this for years, now it's finally happened. Is that the "FUD" from 4 years ago you're referring to? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:04:00
.... because it is?
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:12:53
it's not even remotely like that. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:11:31
Every time I bring this up I get downvoted and people calling it "FUD". Best case scenario a major flaw in the system has been revealed to the public and it'll turn off the general public to bitcoin, worst case it kills bitcoin. Either way it's not good for bitcoin.

That's not how capital gains taxes work. If he made a profit selling bitcoin he owes taxes on those profits, if he then turned around a lost all of those profits he can write off the loss but only up to a certain amount per year. He still owes taxes on the profits from selling the bitcoin in the first place, his mistake was reinvesting all of it and not keeping enough of the profits to even pay the taxes on it.

Uh, Dropbox did have a big CP scandal a while ago but took steps to mitigate the problem. They even created proprietary software to automatically detect and remove it. Basically every form of file sharing software has had to deal with this at some point, the issue is they were able to simply delete the data and try to prevent it from happening again. With the blockchain you *can't* selectively delete the data.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:41:09
... So you're defense is not that it's "bullshit" or "FUD" as you just called it but that there's CP everywhere so what's the big deal??? Seriously? Also you're not even accurately describing what's happened. There's the encoded CP image which, yes you'd need to know how to recompile to view and I think you're correct that a court wouldn't consider that CP but you're totally ignoring all of the direct links to CP images that have been added as well. Even possessing links to CP has been found to be illegal in many jurisdictions including the EU, and there are now direct links in the blockchain. EU, especially german courts could very well find that owning a copy of the ledger is illegal so long as those links are still in there and so far as I'm aware there's no easy way to remove them. Pretty much every file sharing service in the world has at some point had to deal with this, dropbox for example had to create proprietary software to automatically detect and remove CP. It would not be unreasonable for a court to demand Bitcoin take similar measures to prevent such abuses. It sounds to me like you were warned about this possibility years ago and chose to dismiss it as "FUD", now that this very scenario you were warned about is actually happening you're deflecting, diminishing, and denying.

^ This. It doesn't matter if this was done by some peado mother fucker or by some big bank trying to bring down Bitcoin, it's there now, it's illegal, it can't be removed, and it revealed an absolutely *massive* flaw in the system
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:24:08
Correct, there's a limit to how much an individual can claim in losses against their gains per year. I don't recall off hand how much it is exactly but it's not very much. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:08:09
Are you literally complaining that your drug dealer isn't giving you a bigger discount for using Bitcoin? But I thought Bitcoin wasn't used for illicit things!

@_date: 2018-03-20 14:54:08
I don't think they have to prove that you knew it was on your hard drive, simply having it on there accidentally or intentionally it would be a crime. Especially now that it's been widely reported I don't think a court would buy that you were unaware anyway. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:08:56
So it's been known all along that the code was shit and totally unsecured? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:16:54
you paid the sales tax but you'd also owe capital gains on any profits made on the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:56:20
You know that several law enforcement agencies already have division that do just that right? Also, those people go through a ton of therapy and rarely last long in the job because it's disturbing as shit to look at.

There's a section to add small amounts of data like notes about what bitcoin was used to purchase or whatever but someone is using that to add links to CP and it sounds like they worked out a way to actually store an image in there too. No idea why they needed a way to add in notes allowing anyone to add any data they feel like in the first place, seems like massive flaw.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:14:17
It's real. People have been talking about the possibility of something like this for years. We'll have to wait for a court case to find out exactly what the implications will be but it could turn out to be VERY bad for anyone who actually stores a full copy of the ledger and bitcoin in general. I keep seeing people in this sub saying it's fake, or it doesn't matter, or it's not a big deal but they're just in denial. Best case scenario this exposes a major flaw in the security of the blockchain, worst case a lot of people are going to have to go to court and may end up in prison. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:49:50


Please point out where I said there was. I said there are *direct links* in the ledger.
