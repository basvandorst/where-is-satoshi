Very important that you transfer your bitcoins to a personal wallet that you control. Put them on your phone or better yet on a wallet on your computer or buy a hardware wallet. DO NOT LEAVE THEM WITH THE EXCHANGE.. welcome to the bitcoin community.

As many people will tell you use Coinbase to buy and sell but keep your coins in a private wallet that you control.... IE on your phone/Home computer. Transfers in and out don't take that long. The safety of having control of your coins is worth the small wait/fee it takes to send them back and forth.

Thought segwit was bad because it would centralize what is meant to be an uncentralized system.? Bitmain was going to implement changes like bigger block sizes and some other things in the near future.

To the people representing Bitinstant in this discussion I think what people here want from you is better service not explanations and excuses. I have used your services alot in the past and I always dreaded using you. All the complaints i have read about you are true. Instead of coming in here and trying to save face and give us excuses why don't you just let people vent and FIX YOUR SHIT....
