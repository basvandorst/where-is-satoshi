Just like the early internet. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 07:04:53
Let me guess. You heard that theory on the Alex Jones forums from a guy who linked to a Youtube video about the illuminati?
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:02:58
Still waiting. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:36:17
bitcoin can handle very few transactions per second. 
You see all these posts saying how Greece should adopt Bitcoin?
If they did the Blockchain would be dead in a minute. 
It's a major problem and until last month completely ignored beause they don't like to admit that Bitcoin isn't flawless. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:25:43
Nice weather in fantasy land?
@_date: 2015-06-25 13:26:36
Please tell me you are not older than 14. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:31:45
How high does it have to go before you see any kind of profit? 800 or so?
Everything about you just screams desperate bagholder. 
I'm sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:25:13
Is there ever anything not good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:20:06
Everybody knows most coins go to dnm's yet you get downvoted. Probably by the same people who use their coins to buy drugs. 
Bitcoiners love drug markets and love to buy drugs with their coins but don't mention it or they'll downvote you to hell. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:39:46
There is no last time. Nobody in Greece bought coins before during the crisis and neither will they this time. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:51:17
This shit again? Come on. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 00:45:38
Amazing how Bitcoiners have such a hard time to recognize the most obviois scams. I never ever seen a group of people getting scammed so easily as Bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:56:08
Sure. Just re-read it. 
Now can you answer my question or are you just one of those rage downvoters who can't handle reality because they're holding a heavy bag?
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:17:28
Other payment systems you mean. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 00:05:01
Can you cite that specific study please. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 15:22:26
I see. You bought at 800 as well. 
Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 22:52:32
Just like the early internet. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:34:35
Can you show me one example of a paid shill, sock puppet or whatever you call it?
I've seen these accusations for 2 years now. I've seen 100+ threads about it. You know what i haven't seen? Proof that even ONE paid shill ever posted 1 word here. 
Odd, don't you think?
Since there were very nasty socket puppets here i'm sure you can point out a few. Or at least one. 
You'll be the first in this sub to ever do so. How amazing would that be. So go ahead! We're waiting!
@_date: 2015-06-23 23:54:37
The irony is thick in this one. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:20:55
Right. Next year. Always next year. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 17:05:03
Let me guess. This applies to Bitcoin as well?
Just like every other success story you can think of. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:18:29
Bullshit story of the day. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:46:55
Becaus we all know 0 day accounts always lie and 7 year old account never ever lie. Especially Bitcoin cultists. They would never do such a thing. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:34:20
It would go up. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:09:37
I remember Cyprus. It did zero to the Bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 07:41:36
Why the hell would they buy Bitcoin? 
Do you realize Bitcoin lost 70% of it's value?
@_date: 2015-06-25 17:41:56
I have a bridge here i'd like to sell. Really cheap. 
Also my cousin who is a prince in Nigeria might have something for you. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:44:33
Near the beginning was 6 years ago. The early adopters cashed out long ago. Pretty much the only people left are bagholders, traders and darknet buyers. 
Can any of you downvoters show me what part of my post is wrong instead of just hitting that button in pure rage. It's just so childish. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 23:27:56
Funny how nobody seems to be able to answer me. Any idea why?
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:38:52
Moving to Bitcoin is about the worst thing Greece could do. I seriously can't think of anything more stupid. 
But i understand how heavy your bag is. You can't wait to sell your coins for dollars and you need new suckers to buy yours. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:27:52
Neither. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:17:12
Man, imagine an outsider bumping in to this sub. How ridiculous, desperate and cultish you people look. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:30:32
In denial much?
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:22:30
Ok, that's bad. Really bad. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:35:39
They're not gonna buy bitcoins. Just get over it man. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:27:33
What part of my post is wrong?
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:46:27
No. 
And "illimunati insider" wth is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:54:28
Yes. A few 1000 dollars a day should do the trick. But nobody cares. 
Ah look at the downvotes. Bitcoiners hitting that button in total rage to make it go away. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:50:12
I have some bad news for you. The drama and suffering in Greece won't make you rich. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:11:34
Maybe there are people who want to profit. 
Yeah, about 99% of this sub. 
The people in this sub are crying tears of joy because of the misery of the Greek people. Stop pretending anything else is happening. It's sickening. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:44:06
Have fun in your Bitcoin fantasy world. You have a lot of dissapointment ahead of you. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:29:41
If. Bitcoiners their favorite word. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:06:25
For 2 years everyone said that the transaction limit was no problem whatsoever. Just hinting that it might be resulted in mass downvotes. No they're finding out it is actually a huge problem and makes Bitcoin pretty much useless for anything other than some darknet payments. 
It also shows that anyone with a few 1000 dollars can completely slow the blockchain down and till today nobody did. Which means nobody is "fighting" Bitcoin as they try to make you believe here. 
Now watch me get downvoted to hell because these facts make a lot of people very uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:57:07
Sure, keep telling yourself that.
