I'm honestly considering leaving bitcoin, because the community increasingly sounds like or Alex Jones 
@_date: 2014-08-31 07:13:06
It actually is 
;)

It's a pump to keep professor bitcorn from being right :P

Virtual currencies are not necessarily Crypto currencies, they could be talking about  in game tokens for all we know 
@_date: 2014-04-15 21:16:14
The point of a currency is universal usage. 
$Industry coins like Sexcoin are pointless
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:33:20
Really? You don't have a bank account? Or even cash? 
@_date: 2014-08-03 14:27:19
Nope, just rumours 
@_date: 2014-08-21 08:17:38
Doesn't dell offer systems with Linux?

Hey your German translation looks machine translated and is... Well extremely terrible 
eg "Anschrift" for Adress which strictly means Postal address 
I'm both native German and English native speaker, contact me if you like :) 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:42:48
Would be cool if you could just respond to the text with a wallet adress
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:09:39
Such an app exists in Austria, called Quickmac... Minus bitcoin though 
@_date: 2014-04-26 08:12:24
Easiest Option AND safest option is to just boot from a Linux live CD

As a non investor its both entertaining and sad

Feels good to be "back"

Christianity didn't spread when Jesus was born either 
@_date: 2014-08-31 07:41:28
Not limited to US, maybe 
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:40:33
Yes, it's called the laws of Physics. 
The number of available bitcoin addresses is in the vicinity of the age of the Universe *in seconds*
So not gonna happen. 
Also the attacker would have to transfer BTC to all the addresses. And even then it wouldn't make a difference, because in the event of a collision it would just be free BTC for whoever generated the same private key 
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:34:28
Could it be that the bitcoins in your wallet app where "new" and therefore not available for spending to you yet? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:51:35
Just as secure as putting anything else on a website, once you can edit content nothing is safe 
@_date: 2014-06-14 08:35:31
100$ per year, yes 
@_date: 2014-10-14 10:27:52
Nope, only valid for tips you do 
@_date: 2014-07-21 15:47:43
Google Now doesn't display any currencies under stocks right now, even though you can add them 
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:40:42
Casino bitcoin / Peerbet / Cloud bet 
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:00:29
Might check you guys out in the summer :) 
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:24:34
One option would be to support the Litecoin foundation, since they support a lot of projects that help bitcoin too, like P2pool... 
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:47:38
Because its more practical and doesn't look like shit? 
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:08:25
Sure, well depends on your definition of ridiculous 
@_date: 2014-06-11 08:56:50
University's! 
Especially technical ones like the Technical University of Austria ;) 
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:55:07
Could I manually sign a transaction with the private key of a paper wallet without 'ruining'  the wallet like when I use the import private key command 
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:27:33
Fingers crossed that no one decides to dump some million BTC :) 
@_date: 2014-08-09 13:35:35
Male sure to list it at coinmap 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:29:09
You're $100 off
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:37:21
Everybody is just jumping to the conclusions that they want to be true. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 10:05:58
Also note that 2FA would be completely pointless if they'd just turn it off after a random email 
@_date: 2014-06-12 10:55:18
Because there's no server where all pools connect to and report their hashrate or something
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:45:19
That means we might never know the price, if the single bidder doesn't step forward 
@_date: 2014-06-27 08:08:52
Because they use fidor bank which is in fact in Germany 
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:03:41
Should it be live already?
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:07:57
It's adjusted, see here:

Doge gets a Nascar driver, we get a senator? 
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:17:46
Will there also be a U3 with the same chip? :) 
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:41:53
Why? Shouldn't matter where you store your bits, that's like the whole point 
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:32:18
And then be forced to by them on the market. . 
@_date: 2014-07-04 09:01:22
Report back with your experience if you do this :) 
Cases like this are perfect for bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:35:01
Almost all of them. 
But 
* Kraken
* BTC-e 
* Cryptsy
Definitely do 
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:47:55
Are you at ground floor accessible from the street? Previous pictures looked like you are in an office building 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:27:26
Big props to the Litecoin foundation, hope they keep it up with the support :) 
@_date: 2014-07-26 16:47:06
Diesel Bar? 
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:39:29
Well actually it should be, if they don't want to create coinbasecoin
@_date: 2014-09-02 07:41:48
RSA the Company is NOT RSA the Algorithm
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:33:50
That's actually the reading the libre office fork was created (lack of funding and no communication from oracle) people switched because LO is more actively maintained / developed now
@_date: 2014-09-06 06:03:36
If all data on earth is wiped out there will be no more operating systems, firmware, or even bitcoin software. 
Also whatever causes an EMP blast that big would probably wipe out humanity. 
This is extremely pointless

Chrome is just repackaged Chromium though 
@_date: 2014-06-03 06:42:34
No, but on the bright side I'm sure I'll get into buttercoin soon!

My "friend" at the "USMS" tells me all the blocks went for 800+, with the two top blocks going for 1000+

Kraken, no deposit fees 0.35% trade fee 
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:08:32
I wait for the day where I can just search 1 BTC in EUR and get the result just like with other currencies
@_date: 2014-05-08 10:25:08
    response.getRealContent();
           None

You could've gotten 150$ off with the Code Bitcoindeal
@_date: 2014-06-28 21:33:56
In  case you're serious, this Peta stands for petahash, a hosted mining operation by cryptx
@_date: 2014-06-29 10:02:37
Omg CNY can 51% bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:56:50
He bought bitcoins after that though 
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:01:37
And Tresor is the German word 
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:58:25
If you have an idea what the password should be, brute forcing could work 
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:57:20
Not full wallets, but like electrum the block headers are stored 
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:21:26
You can still just Copy paste the address from the bit pay screen into coinbase and send your coins that way 
@_date: 2014-09-17 07:12:40
There was a post on reddit by the guy who made this not long ago because he couldn't pay with credit card somewhere 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:26:19
What? They had *multiple* coin thefts including one total loss already, and now they start thinking about security audits?? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:06:28
Damn, that should have been "December 2014"
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:37:17
Peta  is probably your best option, cheapest price per Ghash as far as I know 
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:53:21
Yes... But they're on ghash
@_date: 2014-07-07 10:04:14
Not Really though 
@_date: 2014-08-31 07:20:24
Amazon doesn't accept PayPal either, do they? 
@_date: 2014-06-22 13:16:26
You cannot do a transfer without a tan anyway... Sofort is a very respectable and widespread payment provider, if the banks didn't like it they would have stopped them already 
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:42:22
Yes, you cannot spend unconfirmed coins from your wallet, that was what the app was waiting for before sending. 
Next time have the bitcoins transferred and available before the purchase 
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:17:58
When setting up the 2fa you need to write down the keys somewhere 
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:47:37
Woah good work! 
I just bought some coins via your sofort Überweisung service, but isn't this even cheaper? :) 
Will check it out tomorrow :D
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:44:38
A Bluetooth mouse would also work, but of course you would need the USB mouse first to connect the Bluetooth one

The devs are commited to changing the POW algorithm as soon as someone creates an asic for it

See this comment 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:15:51
Yes, it's in the reddiquette 
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:27:56
DD-WRT is a custom firmware available for a lot of routers that could do this
@_date: 2015-03-18 07:46:16
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:57:05
Yes but from the top of my head online bitpesa and rebit come to mind, which target Kenya and the Philippines respectively. 
But you could search for bitcoin remittance services maybe there's something for the US too 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:44:29
Yes, assuming you have a EU Bank account still, just register on an exchange that takes SEPA transfers like Kraken or Coinbase.
Then Buy BTC with euro, and then just buy USD with BTC (on coinbase, circle or others.)
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:55:39
Wow extremely cool. Will check this out :) 
@_date: 2015-02-05 18:39:28
You could just generate private Keys yourself and see if there's anything in them... Have fun 
@_date: 2015-02-11 23:10:09
Have you even been born yet?

Exactly this.
