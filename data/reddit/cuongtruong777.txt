Fantastic news

Smart move to ditch the scam US Dollars.
@_date: 2018-09-18 19:16:08
Most people prefer to buy low and sell high. I prefer to buy high and sell higher.

Is this GUSD tradable on Binance or other exchanges? I only buy it if it is.
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:37:06
Which company came up with nextgen chips?

Here is the link to the PDF file. 
Here's the paragraph:
"Currently, the System is not available for corporation users that filed a proof of bankruptcy claim by using the MTGOX online bankruptcy claim filing system. Please wait for a while until it is released."
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:49:38
That's what I meant. To buy is to transfer it between exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:53:48
Recently, I just found a statement on MtGox that saids:
"The System for Corporate Users who filed a proof of bankruptcy claim online is scheduled for release by the middle of September 2018."
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:01:00
I have a corporate account. When will mtgox let people with corporate account to file claim?
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:18:45
LoL at 6 retests.
@_date: 2018-08-31 08:16:57
Why are they making corporate accounts wait longer to file claims? What is the logic behind that?
@_date: 2018-08-12 06:42:15
LoL we get to buy Bitcoin for cheap. Future people have to pay a higher price for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:54:11
Dollar Cost Averaging strategy works best especially when Bitcoin have limited supply.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:30:30
7+ Billions people still don't have access to buy Bitcoin yet!
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:45:43
LoL. Who are you asking to do something?
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:15:26
Who created this puzzle? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:28:48
Lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:28:36
Dollar cost averaging strategy always work for me. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 04:16:52
No, thanks.
@_date: 2018-10-14 22:30:38
The market is rigged. The Bart pattern is 100% accurate.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:19:13
I'd hold.
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:59:32
That's a good idea.
@_date: 2018-06-27 08:15:23
You are right. The crash was just an illusion.
@_date: 2019-02-08 00:09:44
Oh stop it! They'll just make a different coin and continue to run their money scam.
@_date: 2019-02-15 03:40:19
Good idea to make fun of the scam U.S.D from the terrorist organization Federal Reserve.

I mark this chart as spoiler because you are not suppose to know the current trend for Bitcoin is glowing green :)
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:49:30
Bitcoin is not useless, it's a symbol of the general public rising up against the central banks.
@_date: 2019-02-17 20:12:00


Do you have any 'Bloom Filters' indicators? Send me a screenshot of Bloom Filters for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-17 21:44:29
right now the price is not $20,000. I would buy at any price right now! 
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:24:24
Bitcoin downtrend is an illusion the central banks trying to create. Don't look at the high, but look at the low price of Bitcoin monthly chart. You will see an uptrend.
@_date: 2019-02-26 19:30:06
just go to [coinmarketcap.com]( and see the Bitcoin's chart. Look at the lows, and you will see that the lowest price is higher year after year.
@_date: 2019-02-16 10:08:01
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:59:00
The central banks let people short sell Bitcoin now. That's why you see a lot of negative headlines.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:23:28
They are better off investing in crypto then to trust the dishonorable cowards in the central banks.
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:29:43
Those terrorists printed out over $2 Trillion EURO and they expect other countries to not do the same? How could they expect other countries to play fair especially if the E.U. don't play fair.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:16:33
In my opinion, any price under $1 million USD is the right price.
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:34:37
Bad things seem to happen to those supporting the Federal Reserve central bank.
@_date: 2019-09-25 11:55:51
That likely to happen
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:42:42
I think everyone will start to hold Bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:10:08
Satoshi doesn't have a baby yet! 
@_date: 2018-12-22 05:55:01
That's because the cryptocurrency market is rigged. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:01:10
Bitcoin is returning to its true price before the central bank manipulated its price up to trap new investors. This was their shameful attempt to discredit Bitcoin.
