The way you would do it would be to spend it on 1 card and do a balance transfer to the other.  The balance transfer typically has 0% interest.  This is how the UK system works anyway.  I am waiting to see if there were any extra charges on my 2 credit cards, but it doesn't appear to be so far.

I used to get a number of perks through work including shopping cards (similar to this one  and discount vouchers that would get you in the region of 3-15% off retail prices.  The people who took this up and gained maximum advantage were the people who were already fairly careful with their outgoings and organised with their finances, in other words just a small minority.  A saving of 5% is just too small. I think the number would have to be closer to 20% for most people to notice.

It's also why Visa encourages merchants to use 3D secure as a 2 factor where available.  Tokenisation through something like Apple Pay on a mobile may be even better as 3D secure is a bit UI ugly.

I am confused.  Are you talking about after merged mining started?  Wafflepool consistently held more than 51% of dogecoin mining power before the Litecoin merge.  I think even Litecoin has been close to 51% on occasions.  It hasn't been deliberately attacked as far as I know though.

You could probably shop around for a better deal, but this is my normal credit card.  I wanted to see if it would work more than anything.

I understand miners may need to sell to pay for electricity, but the selling volume far exceeds 3600 bitcoins and surely exceeds sales of Dell PCs and bitcoin holidays.  Most holders are fairly optimistic about the future on this sub so why is everyone else selling and when will it stop?

I get this is a joke, but I would point out that you can get 34 months interest free credit with Barclaycard with just a 3% fee.  Bitcoin just has to beat 3% over 34 months for you to come out ahead.

A merchant doesn't have to use it, for example Amazon refuses, but it is quite widespread in Europe.  A pop up shows on completion of the transactions and you have to put in 3 random digits of your password.  The merchant doesn't have your special password so it can't be sold on the black market after a hack, but it could be key logged and after a few times you would have it it.  It does cut down on card not present fraud although I think tokenisation would be better if you can persuade people to use 3rd party wallets.

Bittylicious will also accept credit cards, but only from 3D Secure cards.  I doubt Circle will go on indefinitely accepting card payments.

The government may not be interested in assisting capital flight.

Buying bitcoin on credit - holy crap.  I just need bitcoin to make more than 0% over 12 months.

I may be reading bitcoinwisdom wrong, but it looks like 1800 would be about 1% of 24 hour volume, ie very small and not enough to exert downward pressure.  I saw a post the other day from a Chinese bitcoin trader that basically said 'lots of people here play the virtual currency game'. That worries me somewhat.  If it is a game, I don't get the rules. Stocks generally trade up on good news and down on bad news.  I have no idea what bitcoin is doing.

Just for info, here are the fees broken down from a Visa credit card for a $100 purchase:
 USD @ 1.616400	 
29/09/2014	CIRCLE INTERNET FINANC 			£63.66+
29/09/2014	CASH FEE						£3.00+
	NON STERLING TRANSACTION FEE	£1.75+
So that is 2.9% fee from Circle (interchange processing fee), 3% fee for cash (£3 minimum, so about 4.8% for $100) and 2.75% for foreign transaction.  Total 10.45% this time, minimum 8.65% for credit card.
I like the Circle interface. It was very quick and easy, but I would probably have to use someone that used a UK bank and only pay with debit card if I were to buy more.
