Dude like I said go read what the SA government said. And also the history of SA from 1652 yes before the USA was a a country. They made it about race just like Zimbabwe did in 2001 we all know how that worked out. All I say is South Africa need btc now more then ever and btc can save a lot of people. Hence South African people I did not mention race all I did is repeat what SA government said and approved in parliament today. My goal is to help all people in SA can you imagine BTC was around in 2001 when Zimbabwe did this how many people it would’ve helped.

Let your government take your land and see what you do.

Opinions defer man. But lets hope you are not in my shoes one day and your government will steal your property.

So Bitcoin’s intended design was never to be able to control your own wealth with no middle man or government involved? You Must be new.

Well our reserve bank does not allow us to move money out so we can only buy btc from local exchanges but btc is a bit more expensive in SA and with recent volatility people are scared to move their savings to BTC. Just hope this mining dick measuring and manipulation stops and BTC can be what it is designed to be a decentralized peer to peer form of money that nobody controls.

Asking Bitcoin to help people move their money out of a country that its government is stealing from. And what I worked for and build is my right!
