I use GDAX and pay nothing to deposit or purchase.  
Open a Coinbase account.  Deposit to Coinbase for free.  Transfer from Coinbase to GDAX for free, because they are the same company.  Buy BTC with a limit order for free on GDAX.

I have made dozens of deposits from my credit union checking account and never paid a single penny in fees.

This isn't working for me?
I moved my BTC from Mycelium back to Coinbase after the fork and put it in the vault for safe keeping.  
Downloaded Electron Cash wallet.  Made an account and password. Set it to the electroncash.cascharia.com server.
I went to  with my 12 word mnemonic code to show the keys. 
Pull up Wallet/Private Keys/Sweep in Electron but I cannot get Electron to accept any key that it generates.  "Sweep" stays grayed out.
I must be missing something here.
Any help is appreciated...

Are your depositing via a linked bank account, which is free, or by credit card, which I believe has a fee?

$3,185.27 after it crashes back down from a $12,000 speculative peak.

No.  
Think of Coinbase as a bank, and GDAX is the exchange.  You deposit fiat to Coinbase, it takes 5 days.  Then you can instantly transfer back and forth between Coinbase and GDAX.  You can buy or sell on GDAX for free with limit orders.
I hope this helps.

I am confused?
Do you folks not transfer your cash to GDAX, buy for free with limit orders there, and transfer the BTC/ETH back to Coinbase?  I never have transfer delays except for the fiat deposits from the bank.

To be fair to Poloniex, my confirmation email was just sent.  I will update if the BTC get to Mycelium.
I waited for a confirmation email for 6 hours yesterday and cancelled the transaction.  I resubmitted it this morning and after a 1 hour wait the email was sent.

BTC arrived to Mycelium with multiple confirmations.  
I guess I got lucky... I hope your transactions go through too.

Let us know if you can withdraw any BTC.  I have been trying for 2 days and cannot.

My understanding is that Coinbase is [fully]( [insured]( against loses.

If you transfer the funds to Coinbase Pro (was GDAX) and use limit orders to buy there are 0 fees.

I have been trying to move my BTC from Poloniex to a wallet for 2 days.  The conformation emails are not being sent, effectively locking my account.
