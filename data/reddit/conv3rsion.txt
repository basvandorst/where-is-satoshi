Well the last numbers are a checksum so I think it would be quite difficult to create a valid key set instantly that mimics the correct address. Matching the first four would take a vanity generator longer than the time you're making the transaction but matching the last four also would be effectively impossible I think.
Still the entire purpose of the nano screen is to verify the transaction so it would be great if in a firmware update they changed it back to show you the actual full address.

I think there are still some use cases for paper wallets. I can read through the JavaScript that generates the wallets and feel safe about it. I cannot personally audit a  hardware wallet. If my hardware wallet breaks and I order a new one to replace it and that new one is counterfeit I've just lost all of my money by typing in the seed.
I have had problems on two separate occasions with the cloud software running behind a specific Hardware wallet that prevented me from making transactions. I know that there is work to add more privacy and to remove these issues by using local nodes but I know that is not universal right now
All of this being said I think for 99% of users Hardware wallets are the best option and I recommend them exclusively. I do think paper wallet still have their place and see some reasons for them
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:06:34
A lot of people. These are unregulated markets and no matter how many times we say don't risk more than you can afford to lose it doesn't really matter when human psychology is involved. There has been at least one documented suicide that I'm aware of 
Yes people are free to make their own decisions and yes there are plenty of warnings but there are also people that are looking at this as their only way up in the world and bad shit is just going to happen. I'm not a fan of the death penalty but it is worth mentioning that in many countries the penalty for stealing is that because it's one of the worst things you can do to someone

So here is my theory.  A way to make a lot of money would be to open shorts on another exchange before the hack in the days preceding your actions. Those shorts would depress the price, leading to the behavior we saw. Once the hack crashes the market, your shorts would be very valuable. You wouldn't even have to sell your stolen coins.

I posted this to ethtrader about "the death spiral". This is why I don't think many miners will actually shut down. 
Honestly I hope people believe this bullshit so I can keep buying BTC cheaper. The people parroting this shit are not involved in commercial Bitcoin mining.
But I will explain, for maybe the 20th time, the reasons this is absolutely not going to happen.
1) Widely available current and previous generation Bitcoin mining equipment is extremely profitable over the cost of electricity (in most regions) and will continue to be so after the halving. For example, a previous generation Antminer S7 earns more than double what it costs in electricity today for most US locations. However, commercial mining in the US happens in places (like the state of Washington) where the cost of electricity is 1/5 to 1/10 the cost of average power consumption. This means that for these operations to shut down (as opposed to increasing deployments) Bitcoin will need to fall well under $200 per coin.
2) A large number of commercial miners (especially in China) actually get electricity for free. They will continue mining no matter what happens to the exchange rate.
3) A large number of commercial miners pre-purchase electricity for 6 and 12 month terms and will continue mining regardless of exchange rate because they are effectively locked in already.
4) Bitcoin mining is so profitable that recent deployments (ie within the last six months) resulted in a recent tripling of network difficulty with full knowledge of the coming halvening.
5) The only transactions that "get stuck" when blocks are full those paying inadequate fees. Users with wallets that predict correct fees have not had these issues. Its true that when there are a limited number of seats on the bus, some people won't get one no matter what they pay, however long chain analysis has indicated that Bitcoin likely has a lot of capacity at small average fees rates. In other words, blocks are very far from full at average transaction costs above $0.10
6) A large number of users that had issues during the most recent "fee event" were using blockchain.info's wallet which was not correctly predicting necessary fees. Blockchain has since upgraded their software.
7) Even if the exchange rate did tank, difficulty will readjust as it always has within two weeks. A new equilibrium would be found.
8) And finally, if you still don't believe that there will not be a death spiral, here's the final kicker. When blocks fill up, transaction fees rise, ENCOURAGING MORE MINING.

This is what nobody wants to admit. How incredibly lucrative would it be to pull the old switcheroo at the factory.  All you have to do is fuck with the random seed generation a little bit and boom you are rich.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:14:26
And this is why people need to be very smart about the situation. I didn't lose money in this but having watched the Gox situation unfold I think people would be wise to go along with the Bitfinex plan. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:39:35
Seriously!  Yeah I'm sure it works out ok.  I've also seen Bitcoin shoot through the roof whenever it feels like it. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 20:13:39
I was majorly in favor of upping the blocksize immediately  (for years) until we had the "fee event" where blocks hit the limit for several days and I got to see firsthand how poorly some wallets were providing correctly estimated fees despite having been in existence for many years. Blockchain.info was one major example of this. I also saw how coinbase was committing multiple transactions to the blockchain for every single withdrawal that I made. 
I'm now convinced that the infrastructure will not mature unless it is forced to. I think Classic has done its job by providing a viable alternative and forcing the issue. I think it stands ready if a plan that has consensus isn't followed. But outside of that I'm ready for some growing pains to encourage development which has been shown to not occur otherwise. How much money has been lost by users of those wallets by poor fee estimation? How many users had stuck transactions that wouldn't have been stuck had they paid a few more cents over what some tumbler is paying for extra ( still poor) privacy?  
I'm convinced that Bitcoin, in its current state, still sucks for payments and usability and it needs something else layered on top of it to remedy that. 
Edit: I understand your issues with Peter Todd and Luke-jr. They are severely lacking in the "diplomacy" category and I have been dissatisfied with discussions I've had with them.  Please don't give up what people respect in you which is your ability to remain civil.

Wallet providers need to get fee prediction working. Transaction volume will go up and the difference between happy users and frustrated users will be whether wallets give them a fee which will result in a confirmed transaction if they choose to accept it.

I hope not. Having software alternatives is not a bad thing. Competition (of ideas and code) is good for Bitcoin. The people crying about "hostile takeover" miss the fact that anyone can run any software they want at any time. 
A 2MB hard fork blocksize upgrade was a not-terrible backup option if it gained consensus. It didn't, but that doesn't mean it was a bad thing that it was there.

I think Coinbase would get a lot of "good will" if they had developers contributing pulls to core and working on off-chain scaling solutions
Having said that, I think the fear that "we raised the blocksize once so we are always going to have to do it whenever blocks get full" is completely overblown. 
We should be able to have some type of more concrete "decentralization goals" that we can use to help guide us when its ok to make tradeoffs and to use that for decision making. Bitcoin should support as much transactional capacity as it can without compromising decentralization, and in order to understand what that actually means we need to come up with what "not compromising decentralization" looks like instead of "well node counts dropped (when spv came out) so blocks should actually shrink".

If I could make a feature request it would be to use something that has a seed phrase to generate multiple keys. That way you could hold smaller sums in each address  for when you have to import a single one but still have the whole thing "backed up" by the seed phrase. 
I forget which two bips are required to implement this but I know they're used by Ledger and by Electrum

@_date: 2016-04-01 15:58:30
I appreciate Peter's post and agree with his logic. I do not see any danger in using coin voting as signaling. Some people have knee-jerk "Bitcoin is not a democracy" responses whenever the word "voting" is used, but giving users an option to simply indicate their support for any type of changes or new features (without forcing them to run seperate software explicitly for that purpose) should be a win for Bitcoin. 
As an added benefit, if the "voting" is only enabled through the required use of a full node, we may now have a new reason for people to run full nodes. A lot of alt coins have been experimenting with incentives that encourage decentralization and I really don't see negatives in Bitcoin making full nodes more attractive for "power users". 
@_date: 2016-04-19 04:41:25
TL;DR 
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:04:54
Malware? With the paper wallet you are only risking the funds in the individual address while you sweep and move them. With an HD seed you are risking the funds in all of the addresses generated by that seed.

Paper wallets are ok but please be very careful when spending because of the change address issue. If you don't know what the change address issue is already then simply don't use a paper wallet. 
edit: also I am not vouching for this one in particular.  someone else will have to audit the source code and make sure the key generation is sufficiently random and that private keys always correspond with correct public keys  (something that has failed with other popular ones in the past because of mistakes made in javascript, I believe both bitaddress and myetherwallet have had previous bugs around this but both of them have fixed it).

I think 80-85%+ would be easier to stomach for a lot of folks, myself definitely included.  Jeff's proposal is 90%. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:33:20
This is the increase rate in the monetary supply, however very large portions of the monetary supply are not available or useful for variety of reasons so the net effect is that the ecosystem experiences a much larger increase than this number

@_date: 2015-06-26 14:20:36
Then where is their proposal? Virtually no one publicly claims they want a 1MB blocksize forever. So maybe to move things forward the people against BIP 100 and BIP 101 could at least put out a BIP 102 that discusses in detail a counter proposal AND MOST IMPORTANTLY puts forth SPECIFIC metrics or measures that should be used in making decisions regarding future blocksizes. If that means average global upload speed of X or number Y of nodes or whatever the real CONCRETE needs they feel are, get them on paper and get consensus. 
I think Gavin's plan is the best for future growth, closest to Satoshi's vision, and most likely to create the Bitcoin that a lot of us bought into. And I do literally mean bought into as a lot of the really early adopters made money selling their coins to us on this vision. 
But, I think Jeff's plan has the best shot at consensus and its obvious that it would have support of at least 80% of the network right now (users, miners, exchanges, companies). I like to see Blockstream's plan for "this is what we want" and i'd like to see it sooner rather than later. That way maybe we can get BIP 103 which will pass and we can pop the champagne and move on to other things. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:42:57
95% is even higher than Jeff's proposal of 90%.
I think 80-85% makes the most sense but I'm ok with 75% for the reason that Gavin outlined.

Ok so can someone please explain how many average transactions per second we get implementing this into a soft fork, and also how many we get if the blocksize is increased?  
Is it a straight 60% more transactions scaling linearly with blocksize  so that if right now we get 7 tx/s then a 2MB blocksize with segregated witness would get us 22 tx per second (14 tx/s * 1.6)?
Also, great job everyone who worked on this. The benefits seem numerous and the risks extremely low (because softfork). This shouldn't be contentious right?

I need to read up on GBT but the idea that we need it to be sufficiently cheap to run a full node for miners, when mining equipment and electricity costs hundreds to thousands but a full node with 100x blocksizes costs like $0.50 per day, is a joke imo. miners are not running full nodes because they get no benefit from it. Not because its expensive, especially to them.

I understand that, I'm asking about whether the improvement in the average case is independent of block size as a linear scaling factor.

In other words, for average sized transactions, would the increase in transaction volume remain a constant percentage regardless of blocksize.

It would be awesome if he could explain using exact numbers what network centralization means to him. Nodes are reducing because of the number of wallets which no longer require full nodes, which was never the case in the past when everyone ran QT and 50,000 nodes literally meant 50,000 users. Mining centralized because of ASICs and power costs where you can no longer mine on your laptops CPU  (because of difficulty, not because of blocksize). 
If you want more full nodes, get more users and get them invested. That's why I run them, not because of the NON EXISTENT cost increase (to me) between 1MB and 20MB blocks 
There are currently 6000 nodes running some version of Bitcoin core. Anyone wanting to can create one on a VPS for a nominal fee, and many (most?) users can currently run them on inexpensive hardware from their homes. 
How many nodes are necessary for acceptable decentralization? That's a very straightforward question.

@_date: 2015-06-09 00:08:51
No you can't because if adoption dries up, so does venture capital, infrastructure, and the value of the coins. 
An investment in mining equipment is effectively an investment in Bitcoin. If we keep blocks incredibly small then Bitcoin is less useful (has fewer use cases) and has a smaller economy. 
Miners will make a much higher profit margin if the value of BTC increases, which will only happen with adoption. And adoption is driven by use and value. 
If you want more nodes, get more stakeholders and get them invested. Keeping Bitcoin less useful does not accomplish this.

Gold is terrible at this which is why its not used as a currency nearly anywhere on earth. 
Gold is hard to divide, verify, store, measure, transport, etc. Gold is also cheaper than Bitcoin to use as there is no usage fee. 
"Gold does pretty well" as a currency. Ok buddy. 
Edit: mining being more centralized HAS NOT ONE FUCKING THING to do with blocksize. It has to do with electricity costs and the now required specialized hardware manufacturing. Most people mining today are hashing and they are doing that because of variance, not because of blocksize.

Exactly. People still ride horses, despite cars. People still take trains and buses, long distances, despite planes. Bitcoin enables many new things and will still coexist the same way postal mail does with email. 
The difference in the case with Visa (just that specific use  case) is allowing the buyer to assume the risk, which is cheaper when you have reputation acting as a replacement to escrow. You can still buy / use escrow, but you dont have to. 
There are situations where this makes a lot of sense. For example, try buying Gold online with a credit card and you'll understand. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:58:30

They wouldn't be exiting, they would lose their influence because the fork would assume the majority of users. Its no difference actually from an alt-coin with realistic computing requirements assuming the majority of users.
Some core devs have a very specific idea of what decentralization means and how to protect Bitcoin. Gavin and others have a different idea, which involves more users and use cases and less reliance on 3rd parties or cost in using the system. 
My greatest fear is that Bitcoin is MySpace or Friendster and its gonna lose to the future Facebook because of ideology. If people don't think thats a real threat, I wonder how many successful startups they've worked on.

I wonder if any of these other core devs ever worked on a technology that lost its race. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:36:17
There is a lot to like in this proposal.
1) If you are someone who's top priority is decentralization, there are good safeguards in place. Miners have control of the blocksize, but only up until 32MB, at which case there would need to be another hard fork. Even at 32MB full blocks, most (perhaps nearly all) users could still run very inexpensive full nodes either at home or on VPS. Additionally, it would take a minimum of a year (four time periods of three months each with maximum doubling) after this BIP was enacted to reach that point. Realistically, it will certainly take much longer. 
2) The system can scale (over time) to 32x current capacity without another hard fork. 
3) There will likely be periods where blocks become full (hopefully for less than 3 months) and we will get to observe how the fee market really works. This is not a bad thing because we actually don't know what will happen since we have always had (effectively) unlimited block size. If usage (as a payment network) decreases significantly, and along with it BTC value, miners can vote to increase the block size, thereby reducing fee per transaction, but perhaps increasing total fee revenue as more (cheaper) transactions are created. 
In other words, we will will learn a lot and the system will be more dynamic and responsive.
4) If things get bad, blocks can actually shrink without a hardfork or new softcap. This is a good thing even though hopefully we don't need it. 
5) If you are like me and think that the network could handle 100MB blocks tomorrow with only minimal loss to decentralization, you at least get a path forward to something reasonable. I've been waiting 3 years for a decent proposal. This one is well thought out. 
6) Bitcoin grows up a little and shows that we can still make important changes to the core protocol when it is time. 
If this change gets consensus in the next month then I will support it as the optimal (at this time) solution. If it doesn't I will bring up several XT nodes and start efforts to promote that.
I hope that Gavin, Mike, Greg, Pieter, Adam, and Wladimir can all get on board with this. It is sensible and is certainly a preferable option to other forks and division. 
And hey, maybe we can focus on some other stuff now.

That's not true. The standard fee expectation will continue as it has always been since we have never had full blocks. 
It won't go down by a factor of eight, certainly, because you cannot assume the same transaction volume, especially once costs increase. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:02:10
You certainly can increase the number of people who need to run a full node. Coinbase needs to run a full node. Bitpay needs to run a full node. The large mining pools need to run full nodes. Researchers need to run full nodes. Hobbyists need to run full nodes. 
You make Bitcoin mores useful and interesting, you increase its value, and you get more people who need to run a full node. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:31:43
based on what?  please show me who is currently running a full node today and who will stop with with still reasonable blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:03:06
the vast majority of miner fees are the block subsidy reward and this will be true for at least the next 12 years regardless of a fee market increasing transaction fees. For transaction fees to make up a significant portion of the block subsidy reward, a single bitcoin transaction would need to cost at least $5  (even then, the subsidy reward is higher currently at &gt; $6). 
Additionally, transaction volume will certainly decrease well before people are paying $5 to perform a single transaction, meaning the total transaction revenue may even decrease during this period, and subsidy reward per transaction will increase. 
So, maybe study the math out before saying stuff like that. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:07:47

@_date: 2015-06-26 21:30:32
Jeff's BIP 100 is really well thought out. I don't know how the BIP process works but I'm eagerly awaiting the up or down vote. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:42:06
I misspoke, I meant to say miners will make more money, not a higher margin. There will be more mining revenue, and more mining, and more a secure network.
But, a higher transaction volume with smaller fees might ALSO result in more total transaction revenue as well. You keep selling one apple for $100, I'll sell 10000 for $2 each. 
And Bitcoin is not useful if its expensive to use. In fact, a lot of people wont be able to use it, or will use it less. All of those unbanked people that could be using it, now won't be able to at all.
None of this matters if we don't get more adoption. Bitcoin will be a terrible store of value because it will get replaced if its growth is artificially limited. People who don't realize this haven't worked in tech very long, which is why the actual tech startups all want bigger blocks even if it means less use and direct need of their services (ie coinbase). 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:40:58

i'd argue Gavin's point that its only "so big" relative to the current limit, not to realistic computing requirements for most users. 
However, someone who matters (ie. someone affected by internet connection in China, who runs a mining pool) has come forward and said "actually this will affect us, but here is a compromise that should work".

Honestly I think whats really happening is that executives don't understand what actually makes Bitcoin valuable AND they talk to consultants who can demonstrate why a private blockchain could potentially be valuable for some of the challenges banks are facing when trying to innovate. You put those two things together and suddenly you get a desire to create private blockchains. 
What's obvious (to me at least) is how his is all going to play out and when I've explained what actually makes Bitcoin valuable to people (which is ultimately its censorship resistance and permisionless innovation because of decentralization), some of them get it and then they come to the same conclusion. The challenge is that sometimes people hear "censorship resistance" and they still don't really get it, they thing its just some anarchist or terrorist tool and really what it is, is the internet of trust. That's why analogies to AOL (and other walled gardens) make sense. 
A private blockchain is not extremely valuable or useful and more importantly, is not the right solution for some of the challenges that banks want to use them for. They may still be better than the systems that are in place now, but they are at best an incremental step forward. To use another analogy, this is like travel agents getting computers, vs the creation of expedia.

I'm fine with blocks that increase at 20% per year. I think targeting an average home user is appropriate.

Because before adoption went up you had to run QT, which means you had to be a full node. 
Then we got SPV and mobile and web wallets and you could participate without running a full node. And it was much easier and faster for users. 
Now, the people running nodes are doing it not so that they can use Bitcoin. They are running nodes so that they can trust, support, or build on top of Bitcoin. So if you want more nodes, you need more people requiring trust, or supporting , or starting businesses built on Bitcoin.

What? They are too risky to be your whole portfolio but equities never should be. Otherwise it's about the least risky way to get exposure which probably EVERY portfolio on a 10 year+ timeframe should have.

@_date: 2015-06-01 20:51:37
There is an urgency for block size increases because if we force people to using off-chain systems, we are just creating centralization in those systems. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:27:13
But if those are free then they become more valuable to users. Which makes Bitcoin less valuable (relatively) to users. Thats not what we want. Adoption is not widespread enough.
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:21:50
We are getting into semantics. 
Yes, some services could benefit from running a full node when they otherwise do not have to and therefore, following a cost benefit analysis, should run a full node.
Some other services need to run a full node as they could not survive otherwise. Yes, a cost benefit analysis will agree with this. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:12:03
Buddy, this hot take of yours has been written hundreds of times and has been consistently wrong for nearly a decade now.  Want proof?
Let me explain something simple to you. Bitcoin lets you store inflation-proof censorship-proof money in your fucking head. Pirates used to have to bury their gold and use treasures maps. Now, a pass phrase is all you need to keep access to money forever from anywhere in the world. That's a very very significant use case and its just one of many.   
When I read posts like yours now I don't know if they are part of an intentional FUD campaign, or if you are just new here. After years (and several bubbles) a rational person will finally get it. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:02:51

Might be too late because effort has consolidated behind a different implementation or coin. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 20:08:29
Yes it does. Most people are mining in a pool because of variance. Mining in a pool does not require (or outside of P2Pool support) running a full node.  
So, most miners are members of a pool (because of variance) and because they are members of a pool, they are not running a full node. 
Explain why that is wrong. 
Regarding your link: Gold having value does not mean its a good currency. Its a shit currency, which is why we moved to paper money. Its a good store of value. The equities markets are a lot bigger than gold, also have a lot of value, and also aren't used as currency.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:03:46
you have to be kidding me. the blog posts were not FUD, they were explaining the issue to the larger audience. I'm happy another proposal came forward but Gavin approach was necessary in an attempt to gain consensus. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:42:04
Well we disagree. I don't want to use Coinbase (a trusted 3rd party) to 'use' Bitcoin. I don't want using Bitcoin to be so expensive that the people who don't have access to banking currently are priced out of it and forced to turn over their keys in order to make transactions.
I might as well just go use Paypal. 
And block overflow is not always avoided, but blocksize should respond to realistic computing requirements.  An average home PC on average broadband can still run a full node with 20MB blocks. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:38:56
because a "currency" that is expensive to use or transfer is a fucking terrible currency and decentralization is about more than just node counts. 
Also, we could shrink the blocksize 90% tomorrow and it wouldn't do anything about node counts. They are dropping because most users find SPV to be acceptable.

We'll see and next summer will be the test. We'll have three years of development from the VC that was spent, a block halving, and a lot of "blockchain" technology usage. It might start another bubble, or it might turn out that mainstream adoption is a pipedream or many many years off. 
Either way, I expect BTC to be worth somewhere between $50 and $5000 in fall of 2016, and neither extreme would really surprise me at this point.

If deciding between 20MB blocks in a year with no automatic increases or 8MB blocks in a year with reasonable / conservative increases (and hopefully additional consensus), I'm absolutely in the latter camp. 
We don't need to go through this debate again unless there is a serious problem. We need to get on with other business. Its true that if the increases aren't large enough, we may run out of size again, but at least the system will eventually grow without more changes.

Which large pools support this?  Remember, they are using large pools because their problem is variance, which we both agree has nothing to do with the blocksize. 
I'm claiming that the majority of miners are forced to pool mine, and that pool mining is not supported THROUGH the miners themselves running full nodes. Miners COULD ALSO run a SEPERATE full node but IT WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED WITH THEIR ACTUAL MINING and they would derive no benefit to running a full node with respect to their mining operation. 
Therefore, MINING SPECIFIC centralization has nothing to with running a full node.
So, you can ignore miners specifically from the centralization discussion because anyone, regardless of whether they are mining or not, can run a full node and miners cannot use a full node in their mining operation for the majority of cases. 
When I say mining centralization has occurred, I'm not talking about full nodes, I'm talking about a few large commercial operations instead of tens of thousands of hobbyists. BTW, the commercial operations actually are running full nodes. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:02:02
No. What I'm saying is that Because some % of existing coins are locked up and lost, the 10% increase actually feels like a higher percentage.  For example, if there are 10 million coins and 1 million being created this year, but 2 million of the 10 million are out of circulation and effectively lost, then we have 15% increase (of effective supply) and not 10% for this year . 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:04:08
We are talking about the monetary supply increase per annum expressed as a percentage of new coins being created. 
The more old coins that are lost and uncountable, the higher the percentage is relative to useable supply. 
Inflation isnt the right word, but hopefully my point makes sense now.

What advantage does a private blockchain provide over a normal shared database?
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:02:54
Its not because of blocksize. Its because of wallet choice. Do you think it would go back up if we shrank the blocksize?
edit: most miners use pools and do not run full nodes. This is because of difficulty, not blocksize.

For example, there are websites that pay you in Amazon gift cards for filling out surveys and watching videos. If you don't want Amazon gift cards, you can instead convert them to Bitcoin. You could first instead sell the cards for cash and then use the cash to buy Bitcoin (after depositing it in a bank account and using a website like coinbase), but this still results in fees, extra steps, and waiting periods. 
Purse allows users to go directly from Amazon gift cards to Bitcoin, indirectly, by buying goods on Amazon. It also lets people buy things on Amazon using their Bitcoin (via someone else's giftcard), which is helpful because Amazon does not accept Bitcoin directly. Put the two together and you have a valuable service.

In 2013 and 2014 I argued with all of my strength for the big blocker viewpoint. To me, the only thing that could stop Bitcoin was another coin. 
By the time the DAO fell apart I had already changed my mind. I want to thank the developers who in addition to everything else they did spent untold hours presenting reasoned arguments like Greg Maxwell did here. 
I'm not sure where the perfect balance is for utility and decentralisation amongst projects trying to use blockchains as global computers, but I do know for sure that Bitcoin is the best money.

I've been a bitcoin evangelist for 4 years now. I hold coins. I get people excited talking about the promise. I drive with bumper stickers. I go to conferences. I convince others to purchase in amounts they can afford to lose. 
I run nodes, I used to mine, I sold mining hardware. I'm currently working on a Bitcoin related app. 
I'm about to sell my coins and go home. I'm so fucking tired of this bullshit. There is no good reason why we can't increase the blocksize right now. None. There are a lot of posts about "changing what people agreed to" and what I agreed to was what I read in the white paper and on the scalability wiki. When early developers made money selling coins, it was to people like me under these premises. If you sold that future and profited from it, you have a moral obligation to support it. 
"I don't know what subset of use cases Bitcoin will cater to in the long
term. They have already changed - you see way less betting transactions
these days than a few years ago for example - and they will keep changing,
independent of what effective block sizes we end up with. I don't think we
should be afraid of this change or try to stop it."
The most valuable Bitcoin has the largest number of users and use cases. That doesn't mean everything has to go on the blockchain, certainly not, but it does mean that we should support what is currently feasible and the super majority of the ecosystem agrees that 8MB blocks are feasible today. 
I am more interested in bringing banking to the unbanked and having a system that truly does not require the trust of 3rd parties than one which flat out refuses to take advantage of advances in computing. 
"People say that larger blocks are necessary. In the long term, I agree - in
the sense that systems that do not evolve tend to be replaced by other
They sure do. The only question is what is the long term to you? 6 years is the long term to me. It will be too late to change if something else gets traction. Thats how it works. We need to prove that the protocol can still be improved as time goes on. Thats what this is really about.

Actually Bitcoin is a protocol that uses proof of work and cryptography to achieve consensus in a zero-trust network. It is the first implementation that has successfully solved the Byzantine Generals' problem. The bitcoin units themselves are more like a commodity than a traditional monetary currency.

So the blockchain is the public ledger of Bitcoin. It is a collection of blocks (which are groups of Bitcoin transactions), with each referencing a previous one. 
The blockchain is built using a concept known as proof of work which is requires that before you can add a new block, you have to demonstrate that you found a solution to what is effectively a mathematical problem (solving for a hash). These solutions are easy to verify and this is important.
The way bitcoin works is that the network clients accept the longest broadcast chain of blocks (containing the most amount of work). If a longer chain later gets broadcast, the original chain is disgarded in favor of the longer chain. This is why you are instructed for wait for 6 "confirmations" before trusting a transaction. Those confirmations are actually just new blocks. The larger the number of new blocks, the harder it is to cause a chain to be orphaned (more work is required).
If you control over 51% of the network, then the rest of the network can never catch up to you. So what you can do is spend bitcoin, mine a longer blockchain, broadcast the chain (orphaning the blocks where you spent bitcoin) and then "double spend" your bitcoin again.
I hope this was helpful, its honestly very hard to explain but it goes to the genius of Bitcoin.

I dont think you understand how innovation works. Bitcoin is much more than a currency. It is the internet of money. What it will enable is absolutely mind boggling, but it will take time to create the systems necessary. To draw an analogy, we are now in the mid 90s and AOL hasn't happened yet. 
If there is too much regulation, innovation will happen outside of the US. If you want to participate in that innovation, you will have to move or at least work for a foreign company. There is a reason that Google didn't start in China and there is a reason that there are no large Bitcoin exchanges currently in the US.

These are legitimate points, but remember Mt Gox was the largest exchange in the world. They should have a hired core bitcoin developer who was actually an expert and aware of known edge cases. They didn't do that and it bit them in the ass. 
With the exception of Gavin, the BTC developers are unpaid volunteers. Granted, many of them are probably very wealthy due to their early exposure to Bitcoin, but main responsibilty still lives with the commercial enterprise taking a user's money. 
Gox has had years to get it together. They've failed to do so, fantastically and repeatedly. They deserve to go out of business and probably will. It truly sucks for the people who have money there, but they are completely at fault here.

Everything is a compromise. Bitcoin could be more decentralized with even smaller blocks. We could all run bitcoind on our watches and smart tvs and graphing calculators.
Its a lot less useful though when the network can only handle 1 transaction per hour and that transaction costs the equivalent of $100 USD to perform. 
That doesn't mean decentralization is negotiable, it means its a goal along with things like, you know, usability. 
Edit: Security is the exact same. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:15:33
There are many people who want to preserve maximum decentralization at the expense of useful technology. The would prefer a smaller Bitcoin that can be run anywhere, to a USEFUL Bitcoin that has a maximum number of users and use cases. 
There is a balance of course. And there are ideologues who don't care. The really sad thing is things actually end up more centralized if you keep the blocksize limit in place because there is more use of off chain transactions and central authorities to provide those. And there is less use of Bitcoin (because single transactions are more expensive) leaving a large number of users out to dry.

This is wrong. While the store receives currency instead of bitcoins "instantly", there is still a float period mitigated for them by the payment processor, as well as one by the consumer.
These float periods cumulatively add up to reduce the available supply of bitcoins. If there is enough economic activity, the price has to rise to compensate.

You're right, its not acceptable. It's immoral.
And I don't want a world where the government attempts to force the necessary changes (and needs to be powerful enough to do that). I want a world where we stand up together to turn away from the glorification of materialism and begin to truly value the prosperity and security of all. That mother didn't fail her son, her nation failed her son, and the human race failed her son.  
I think Bitcoin can help with that on multiple fronts.  
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:13:24
You're plan is simple and makes a lot sense. I really hope that a large consensus gets on board and supports it. 
There is going to be a fork one way or another once we hit the block size limit because there is too much at stake for there not to be. Depending on how well this is handled, most the current value of Bitcoin will be preserved or it wont be. Since the most crucial metric is (and always will be) user adoption, the pragmatists should beat the ideologues as they generally do.

Yes it does. Don't conflate "a bitcoin" with Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows for the creation of new wealth in the same way that the web did. Bitcoin is more than the payment network. Bitcoin is a platform. It is distributed consensus and trust.

Ignoring all other markets, uses, and speculation, if bitcoin captures 5% of solely the store of value market (as a competitor to gold) it can sustain that inflation level and then some. It can certainly do that without becoming the de facto reserve currency.

What he's saying is that the chinese volume is dropping. He's speculating this is because fewer bitcoins are on the Chinese exchanges and are now being moved to the other exchanges (where volumes are rising), meaning that chinese owners have fewer bitcoins. 
I don't know if you can infer that lower volume equals fewer bitcoins though, but this is the reverse of the pattern when the trend was upwards, which was attributed to heavier Chinese involvement.

its not so much the number of stores accepting them. its number of people using them to buy things from these stores and the periods of time that they hold them prior to doing that. You're suggesting fiat -&gt; bitcoin will get easier and faster, and it probably will get faster but it won't be instantaneous because it can't be. Someone has to hold the coins. If coinbase makes a feature that is "buy instantly with bitcoins based on a future bank transfer that will happen in 3 days" then that somebody, in the meantime, is coinbase. 
Also saying that there is nothing being produced (so its not an investment) is silly. Buying a bitcoin is essentially buying an ETF on the entire space.

Thanks. I don't really care about downvotes. As soon as a sub gets big enough, the disagreement downvotes come flying in. There is nothing I just said that was wrong. The price of bitcoins and the size of the economy it can support are correlated in several ways, and some of those are related to the velocity of money. The idea that bitcoin can be used for significant economic activity, without a sufficient money stock, is incorrect. Even if someone disagrees with me, there is no reason to downvote that statement.

Bitcoin decreases friction, therefore it allows for an increase in the ability to support economic activity, therefore it allows for the increase of wealth in the world.

If we need more users using their own full nodes as their primary wallets then this is never going to work because SPV will always be faster and easier and there is no incentive to make one's own bitcoin experience slower and harder. I realize then that bigger blocks increases that delta, but if putting a full node on a raspberry pi is effectively worthless and instead I need to run it on my phone and use it as my primary wallet, we are already past the point of making that work. 
I will say now that I understand where you are coming from. But I guess I've always felt that mining was going to centralize (to a degree) because it requires power and power generation is cheaper in specific places and for specific reasons.

Coinbase has said publicly they alone have 600,000 active users and since they only operate in the US, the minimum number of Bitcoin users will be much higher than this user count floor
Blockchain.info has 1 million separate wallets. 
Ballpark puts it at somewhere from 1 million and 3 million total users. 2 million is the best estimate.

I said its not going to hurt anything. You said there will be more spam (likely) and impact (unknown to what extent if any). 
I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is and run full nodes. This isn't about passing the buck. I believe 1MB blocks are too small and that the additional cost of storage and bandwidth to use 20MB blocks is so trivial that the impact will be negligible. Its also a cost that decreases over time. 
And also the costs for spamming today are actually the same. I can still throw 19MB of spam into the blockchain, it just takes me longer to do so. We've had some amount of free transactions the entire time that Bitcoin has grown. Not having that is a RADICAL change.

Greg, I started a company that sold thousands and thousands of ASIC miners. The loss of mining decentralization had nothing to do with blocksize. Its inevitable for a POW system.  There are a limited number of places on this earth where mining will ultimately make sense and it will continue to move towards those places and away from hobbyists. 
But, we CAN still have a tremendous number of full nodes. The decrease in full nodes is due to the option of using SPV clients. That's going to continue until the only people running full nodes are enthusiasts, just like it is for webservers today. 
If we can get more users, we can get more enthusiasts, and those people will run full nodes for the $10-$20 a year that it will cost regardless of (realistic) blocksize. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:00:21

According to my number, 50-75% of bitcoin users don't have their own addresses WITH CURRENT FUNDS. 
Its completely accurate because many users make use of shared addresses (like coinbase) as their primary wallet. 
But hey, keep believing that people who sign up for exchanges (mt gox) or money transfer sites (coinbase) or merchant accounts (bitpay) are not "bitcoin users". 
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:04:46
its even more than that. Apple took a HUUUUGE gamble on a $600 FULLY SUBSIDIZED phone. Part of the reason it wasn't attempted is because it wasn't believed to be viable. Especially without a QWERTY keyboard. Steve Jobs bet the company on it.

@_date: 2015-05-07 17:50:49
we wont be fine either way. bitcoin has always grown under a model of effectively free block space and miner subsidization through inflation. Once effectively free block space goes way, transaction fees will rise based on scarcity. This will negate several of bitcoin's advantages, those being decentralized USE and cheap / free transactions. 
This will then hurt user adoption, which at this point is the most important thing there is. In fact, the whole thing could implode as usage drops, VC drys up, and companies pull out. You'll be left with some ideologues, their toy, and a tremendous amount of wasted potential. 
Now on the flip side, if we can get everyone using this, we can insure the security of the network by creating enough stakeholders who will protect it. A high exchange rate and lots of transactions will help pay for the security, even if we still have some lower priority free transacations. Not to mention a lot more people fighting for this. 
Its more important to sell 100000 apples for a buck than one for $100. Especially for something that makes use of the network effect for its value creation.

As a payment network (as opposed to a decentralized currency, distributed ledger, store of value, or any of the other things Bitcoin also is) the MOST important thing is quick and cheap transactions. Its what enables Bitcoin to compete with credit cards, bank wires, ACH, and many other payment types (some of which are still to be invented). 
Keeping Bitcoin both inexpensive to USE and decentralized are the two most important things for it to be successful. Balancing these needs is the whole ballgame. 
With bandwidth and storage costs decreasing over time, there is no reason that a single Bitcoin transaction should ever cost more than a penny (no matter how many nodes there are). 
A quick calculation reveals that the average transaction is about 238 bytes. A 3 TB hard drive costs $110 on Amazon. That hard drive can hold about 14,000,000,000,000 transactions.

I have a very simple question in response to your post. 
What rule changes have been proposed that ACTUALLY stop my ability to run a full node? 
BIP101 was the most aggressive proposed block size increase. It included an 8MB (maximum, not average) blocksize increase and a doubling interval. 
The BIP states
"The doubling interval was chosen based on long-term growth trends for CPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth. The 20-year limit was chosen because exponential growth cannot continue forever. "
This was the most aggressive proposal, did not gain consensus (and was recently withdrawn because of that),  and I still do not believe that it **ever** put my ability to run a full node in jeopardy. 
A one time increase to a 2MB or 4MB MAXIMUM blocksize **certainly** does not. 
The slippery slop argument is bullshit. We can judge every proposal on its own merit and of course we will.
So again I ask:
What rule changes have been proposed that ACTUALLY stop my ability to run a full node? 
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:44:56
right now it sounds like its going to be a dynamically resizing max block size, which is a lot smarter

Bitcoin just got a real dev branch. Also Mike can you talk about the specifics of how block size increase is currently planned for XT? My understanding is it is similar to Gavin's old plan of automatic timed size increases that no longer will require hard forks. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:22:15
Nice job. I think wallets will get better though and by the end of the year you won't hear much about user experiences or stuck transactions. I don't know that a lot of merchants will leave for fees in the $0.05-$0.10 range if they haven't already left for lack of usage.

it is a set number. Right now that number is set at 1MB. I'm asking you what number do you consider SUFFICIENTLY passive. You said its not 20MB, so I'm asking you what number is in your opinion and how do you justify that opinion using evidence. Gavin would likely argue that 20MB blocks are sufficiently passive and 200MB are still possible on midrange hardware (if then perhaps not passive)
100kb blocks may be too much for some, that doesn't mean the limit should be lowered.

yes, midrange network i/o
the average broadband speed in the world is over 20 Mbps. That could support block sizes larger than 1 GB easily (Assuming blocks every 10 minutes on average). Thats 2500x what we are doing today and 50x larger than THE MAXIMUM SIZE of this proposal. 
I had faster internet than you do today over 15 years ago and I live in the US, where our broadband is still behind many other countries. I'm not trying to be unsympathetic, I just want a reasonable compromise. 
You could run an increased blocksize on dial modems from the mid 90s.  Do we really need to support even slower speeds at the expense of usefulness and an increase in tranasaction cost that prices out huge numbers of users and creates more use of centralized services (thus defeating the whole point)?

Unless they figure out pooled staking, there will be only a few hundred validators VS thousands of miners 
And that's only the security aspect of centralization. Every other metric is more centralized than Bitcoin except for current mining (maybe) and that's getting changed

no, in fact, lets lower the fucking blocksize even more. Lets have 10 KB blocks so we can get maximum decentralization and run a useless Bitcoin on our old graphing calculators from middle school.  /sarcasm
Gavin just proved we can run what is effectively 40x the current transaction volume on midrange hardware from 3 years ago. Lets start by not being ridiculous. Do you honestly think that a lower blocksize from the beginning would mean we would have more nodes today? 
even only 100 kb/s net speed would support much larger blocks than we have today. That said, I'm sorry your internet is so bad, because by any realistic standard its completely terrible. The average in Australia is 16.1 Mbps. Source:

You know what sucks? Because this study contradicts the beliefs of certain core developers, specifically those that think that node count decreases were due to increasing resource utilization and not instead primarily the fact that users gained the optional usage of lite mobile clients, it will never change anyone's thinking.
According to the paper we could have 4MB blocks with almost no affect to decentralization today. It also states we could maintain substantial decentralization while having a 40MB maximum blocksize and subsequently allowing 250 transactions per second onchain right now. 
@_date: 2016-03-11 19:17:18
Miners have have a higher economic incentive to protect the value of Bitcoin than anyone because they are exclusively paid in Bitcoin. The entire system is based around economic rationality  (for example, why miners include transactions at all). 
Bitcoin's security is dependent on miners and their aligned interests. 
The attitude that people have of miners being basically powerless employees is hilarious. The reality is that Bitcoin will be whatever the chain with most continuing work ultimately wants it to be.  Things would have already centralized to a much higher degree than they have if there wasn't an economic incentive in maintaining (at least the appearance of) decentralization. 
We can fork to a new PoW algorithm, but it would be a new coin for all purposes and trust in cryptocurrency will disappear.

im interested in his solution too. We can get 20x the capacity, today, on midrange hardware from 3 years ago. But because that's not, by itself, and ultimate silver bullet i guess we should stick with 7 tx per second and let something less dogmatic take over. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:39:03
I know everything you are saying already. I know the xkcd link without clicking on it.  That's not the fucking point. The point is that the chance of 
1) Someone finding his paper wallet
2) That person knowing what it is or being inclined to find out
3) That person having the ability and resources to crack it and choosing to do so
is infinitely lower than
1) Him forgetting or screwing up his password in his head. 
So i'm arguing a simpler password, in his situation, is better than 12 random words. 
Regarding degraded copies, hopefully he makes more than one. 
Further, any valid bip39 password is also a valid bip38 password. So saying they are automatically easier to crack is ridiculous. The entropy can even be higher if he wanted. It can even be higher in a way thats easier to remember. That's again not the point. 
At the end of the day, if its my money and I can't interact with it in any way for 3 years, I'm going to do something to ensure I don't forget the password because thats the most likely thing that is going to happen.  Not someone finding his paper wallet, figuring out what it is, and finding and hiring a password cracker on the internet who has the hardware and is able to brute force it.

correlation is not causation. SPV clients have allowed users to stop running full clients whereas before there was no choice. I would assume this has had more of an effect on the number of full nodes than anything else. 
The entire blockchain currently fits on a $10 usb flash drive. If you think that cost is the reason full nodes have dropped by over 70% then we just simply disagree.
edit: regarding sidechains, its a great idea but lets see some working implementation first before we look at is as a possible solution. In the meantime, lets buy ourselves some more time with some reasonable compromises.

You're right. Lack of adoption means we have friendster or betamax. It means VC goes away, businesses close, btc value goes down, and Bitcoin is replaced. this is the real danger, not some nonexistent reduction in decentralisation that still very manageable block sizes would create.

I believe I watched a video years ago where Gavin makes a claim to my first point, which I think is the strongest of my three. 
Maybe we should just ask him, this is the internet and we do have the power. 
u/gavinandresen Did I hallucinate that memory or is that what happened?
Edit: What views do you suggest that I ascribe to Satoshi?  That he had "trusted Gavin with Bitcoin"? There are a myriad of reasons that Satoshi might not be able to say anything right now, including that he might not be alive. My only claim at all is effectively what I remember Gavin saving. It would be great if Gavin choses to help clarify this here but he probably won't see the purpose.

I don't understand why everyone thinks we need the final solution today. Prove that most people can still easily run a full node on midrange hardware from 3 years ago with a reasonable increase to 20mb blocks (or even possibly 10x that amount as Gavin is doing with this 200 MB block test), and buy us some time to continue to innovate. That's 50x what we are using today. Its a no brainer. 50% of Paypal today is a great fucking goal. 
I've been in Bitcoin since 2011. If the blocksize limit isn't raised im selling my coins, shutting down my nodes, and getting out completely. I'm not going to be a part of something that lets ideologues dominate pragmatism up until the point the technology is obsolete and replaced. I want the whole world to be able to use Bitcoin and 3 tx/sec is not going to get it done wihtout relying on centralized services that defeat the whole point.

Ethereum is not Bitcoin. Ethereum is risky as fuck. Ethereum is centralized in so many ways I can't even describe them all here. 
A plan to increase on-chain scaling was discussed by the person who put the current limit in place 5.5 years ago. If people want minimum utility but "maybe" max-decentralization-coin (because it runs on the apple watch) then they should fork something with an even smaller limit and a better PoW function. 
Its good that people have options, but a large portion of the community will not support a bait and switch. 
Edit: People should read about how Ethereum is planing to implement PoS and decide if they support that.

oh god, a whole terabyte PER YEAR? So you mean if I spend $150 today I can only afford 5 MORE YEARS of transactions of then MAXIMUM blocks?
Do you want this shit to actually be useful and used or not?
Storage will continue to get cheaper. This isn't the whole answer. This is part of the answer. 
Also, of all the limiting factors, networking is the most pressing. Followed by storage. CPU is not the limiting factor. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:00:36
we are so far away from things being easy and useful enough for widespread adoption that its really not worrying. The solutions that are rolled out, like multisig, are actually more complicated for the average person. That same average person (at least in the US) has minimal benefit from using Bitcoin for the majority of their purchases. 
It will change though. How do I know this? Because I see users being rewarded. Right now you can buy shit cheaper on Amazon using Gyft and Bitcoin then your CC rewards. Think about how much money that is over just Amazon. As it gets easier and the rewards increase, so will adoption. It could be 5 years though, depending on what gets built and how good it is. 
TL;DR, the internet sucked in 1990 too. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:19:21
Its not $30 per year. Its $30 per year, if all disk for the full 5 years was bought today AND all blocks were maximun size for the entire duration of five years. In other words, if we prepurchased all the storage today and used the maximum possible the entire time. 
I want decentralization too, but the storage costs are effectively trivial at this point, even with 50x current transaction volume. Increasing usage and adoption is much more important than whether it costs $10 or $20 per year to run a node today. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:45:11
If it really lowers orphan rates by 1% then I expect miners to take it.

I don't think people understand what changing the proof of work algorithm would actually do. It would forfeit all of the existing  security investment. That security investment would continue mining on its current chain and would retain the Bitcoin brand certainly.
Changing the algorithm is the most ridiculous nuclear option there is, and would be likely impossible to get majority consensus. Even if it had it, the coin with the new algorithm would be extremely vulnerable since whatever market cap Bitcoin still had would be likely be much higher then any new mining investment at the time.

End of the year likely. The big question is what happens then because  someone will make a PoW fork. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:58:02
no because blocks currently (and have always so far) had room for zero fee transactions since we have never hit the blocksize limit to this point.
the only risk is that in the future when the reward subsidy decreases, lack of sufficient transaction fees (from non artificially limited block sizes) would mean less security, because the blocks would have smaller theoretical mining rewards, and thus less mining overall. 
I'm not really worried about that, and here's one reason why. There is another aspect of "security" that is overlooked besides transaction fees and that is that holders of bitcoin also have incentive to maintain a sufficiently secure hashrate, the same way they have an incentive to run additional full nodes today (and many do) without any financial reward. Therefore, the more useful and valuable bitcoin is, the more those who reap the largest benefits from it will take steps to protect it. It isn't really tragedy of the commons there. 
We don't know for sure what will happen as the block reward decreases and block size stays "open" as it is today. We do know what will happen if Bitcoin doesn't scale, and that is that it will become friendster and will be replaced by something else that does. 
A less useful Bitcoin is a more quickly replaced Bitcoin. Its also a less secure Bitcoin ultimately.

That would be really easy software to write. All you have to do is wait up to 60 Seconds from the last withdrawal request and if there is another one to combine the transactions. You then extend the timer by some factor if you wanted to take this further.  You could easily continue this for up to 10 minutes with no real change to the users perception since confirmations take 10 minutes anyway so on average  it would result in a delay of no more than one block.  Coinbase would save up to $1 from that single user action and the net effect on the rest of the ecosystem will be less fee pressure

No it doesn't.  The argument xkcd is making is that a short password is not made especially more secure by including (mixed case, numbers, symbols)  but it is made harder to remember. This is not the argument I am making.
I told him to use bip 38 with a password he can remember. In reality, it doesn't effectively matter what that password is because nobody is getting it, knowing what it is, and also having the skills and desire to crack it. 
The xkcd example is 4 nouns the user chose. An electrum seed is 12 words which you do not get to pick and are  not easy to remember. I'm looking at one of my 12 seed phrases and it includes nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 


My argument is about what is safest for him. Your argument is that he is more likely to have one of his paper wallet copies fall into hands of someone who can and will break them and steal the money than he is to screw up a randomly generated 12 word password he never writes down. I've worked with regular people in IT for longer than you have probably been alive and I know that's bullshit.

Interest still compounds. If your interest rate is less than inflation then your total value will be worth less in the future then today but it will still be worth more than if interest didn't compound. 
Words matter. Just because there is inflation does not mean there is not also compound interest.

I think this is part of the reason people wanted a hardfork date on core's roadmap. Even if July 2017 is very far away, and nothing is certain, there is at least a communicated plan with some level of specificity. 
Some people are still holding out hope that following a combination of segwit and a hardfork (to clean up segwit, to prove we can upgrade, and to very slightly raise the cap further), we can get most people on the same team again and stop fighting.
@_date: 2016-03-07 01:20:08
I think the best way to get people to run full nodes is to make Core the best wallet and only let it run in full node mode. Then if people want core specific features, they won't have a choice. 
But lets be honest here, Core is not a good wallet.

Yes but again, you would own coins on both forks so you could wait as long as you want to make a determination as to what to do without any additional risk.
 I think its likely that a highly contentious fork with very large sides (e.g. 30% and 70%) would result in a much smaller total combined market cap (at least temporarily). Its possible though that it doesn't because sometimes divorce actually is better for everyone. Nobody really knows what would ultimately happen but concerned people could do nothing and let things sort themselves out. 
Exchanges would have major problems and if I was running one I'd be figuring out what to do now. If something like Classic started a fork and it was barely over the threshold then there wouldnt be much time at that point during the activation phase.
Ultimately, Bitcoin is a fucking honeybader and will continue evolving.

Miners are a required piece of the consensus required to increase the blocksize limit. They cannot increase the limit without a significant number of full nodes supporting that change. They would not attempt to increase the blocksize limit if there was not sufficient consensus to offset the economic risk of doing so. 
In order words, we can't fork without miners (even after a fork we can't force them to make bigger blocks). Miners can't fork without a sufficient number of supporting full nodes and enough existing network consensus offset economic risk. 
Edit: if you chose to downvote me it would be great if you could actually refute my points. You cannot hardfork without miners. Miners won't fork without a financial benefit in doing so. "Bitcoin" will likely still be whatever the miners are hashing on.

It's more centralized in nearly every single way.
It has fewer nodes, it has a smaller community, it has fewer supported exchanges, it has fewer (actually effectively no) merchants
Decision-making is more centralized ( this is maybe good actually who knows)
It is heavily centrally planned. It was effectively pre-mined
It has fewer developers and fewer conferences
Resource requirements will grow much higher than Bitcoin unless sharding works exactly as intended and even then resource requirements may exceed what happens with Bitcoin
The one advantage it has right now (for decentralisation) is an ASIC resistant proof of work algorithm that is largely profitable to mine anywhere on the earth and unfortunately even that's going to go away this year

Yes, if the person who got his paper wallet had one in their possession and his password was extremely simple, but thats not too fucking likely is it. Its not a brain wallet hashed and published to the world. 
Come on. 
I tried to give him advice that would make him most likely to keep his coins when he gets out and be simple enough to follow. It is more likely he would forget part of that password in his head then someone would get his paper wallet and brute force attack it with a scrypt ASIC or all copies would be destroyed.  Would I do it a different way personally?  Yes I would probably get a hardware wallet and just memorize part of the seed and back up  and print out the rest everywhere (multiple copies) . With anything mildly obscured and offline theft is not really his enemy. Destruction (of all available copies) and forgetting something is. 
That's my opinion. If it was me, I would not rely on memorizing 12 worlds and risking getting something out of order or not recalling.

I do know that majority consensus rules have already changed in the past, and will almost certainly will change again in the future, and that jumping to the coin limit is a knee jerk reaction because of all of the consensus rules its the least likely to change.

I predict the market will decide what happens. If it becomes obvious that limited blocksize is hurting Bitcoin, the market will move to increase blocks. If is not obvious to a majority of participants, as it appears to not be today, there will not be a significant change because it is seen as risky. 
If core hadn't come forward with Segwit and finally a hardfork estimate, and had not produced a scaling roadmap, then it seems obvious support would have grown for increasing the constant.

And you're a dick who apparently can't read. That wasn't necessary.


That's interesting because I did sync the blockchain two weeks ago, on a 3 year old computer, using core from 2013.  It was certainly slow, but it worked. 


And I'm telling you that it is faster now on current hardware, even with the additional data, then it was in 2013 on then current hardware and I know this because I did a recent test. I can sync the entire history of Bitcoin in half a day. If its pointlessly slow now, I'm not sure what it was 3 years ago, because it is much improved. 
What's the argument again?


The exact point that I made was that people don't need to and so they aren't doing it. All the bullshit about nodes dropping because of compute resources ignores the proliferation of web and SPV wallets. Most people just wanted wallets, they didn't give a fuck about being a full node, regardless of resource utilization. Of course, heavy resource utilization is going to reduce further the people willing to do it, but that wasn't the central driver in node reduction, and the evidence of that should be that the reduction didn't reverse as compute performance dramatically increased. 
We are approaching the point where it will be possible to run a full node on a smartphone (with some limited security) and people still won't run them because they do not derive a benefit from it. There isn't going to be a magical point where computing resources are so low that people suddenly get a benefit that they currently don't today. So maybe we should work on building in benefits rather than building a crippled settlement layer that runs on cell phones.

Umm, if off-chain company is misbehaving, I can't withdraw my money. You might have heard of Mt Gox?
Its not insane, it was always the goal. I want Bitcoin to work tomorrow the way it does today, regardless of the number of users. Because, the more users, the more value the whole system has for all participants. 
That's what was in the white paper. That's what I signed up for. That's what the fucking goal is. Not some settlement network relying on easy to manipulate 3rd parties. Not something that is so expensive to use that it prices out users.  
I don't have a problem with off chain companies. I dont think everything HAS to be written to the blockchain. Changetip is fine, lightning networks are fine. But I want to be able to make a Bitcoin transaction for under a penny, because there is no good reason (technically, economically) that we can't. It sure doesn't cost a penny to store that single line of data forever in any reasonable number of nodes. Storage and bandwidth costs are decreasing as well. 
I don't believe reasonable blocksizes will hurt decentralization. I don't believe a fee market is necessary until inflation is incredibly small (and maybe not ever as long as this thing has value. Which it will if and only if it has users).

Looks like Bitcoin has already won guys. Lets pop some champagne and celebrate. 
But to actually be serious for a minute, its completely possible that a more efficient consensus mechanism than PoW is discovered (e.g. someone pulls off a viable PoS implementation that has significant advantages) and that Bitcoin at that time is not able to implement said mechanism quickly enough (because of entrenched interests) until after the time which Bitcoin has given up its market share and has lost its first mover advantage. 
7 years of blockchain history and "price discovery" won't fix that. 
The idea that "better shit can be added as its proven" is silly when your user base is a few million out of billions. People who know anything about the history of technologies, especially those experiencing network effects, have already seen this before. 
I don't say this because I think Bitcoin is going to lose. Actually I think its doing well considering how much negativity it is experiencing and how poorly a lot of wallets were able to cope with the fee event. But I also think its completely ridiculous to believe that Bitcoin's existing advantages are effectively insurmountable by a competing technology.

Wallets will upgrade to include sufficient dynamic fees (they have to) and merchants receiving software can estimate the likelyhood that a transaction will confirm and price that in with the value of the good. Businesses already do this with regard to credit card fraud. 
RBF does make it more complicated but better software will alleviate some of these problems. 


Ugh, small / zero fees are never expected to confirm. If a wallet does that its a bad wallet and the user needs to make another choice. Its not about merchants accepting certain wallets, its about them accepting certain broadcast transactions. 


Wallets need to get better. Mycelium let you shoot yourself in the foot AND you decided to not pay $0.05 on a transaction and risk it.

Of course all my assumptions predicate on this one.

I mean you might as well argue the price of the less secured chain processing fewer transactions is going to go up, which is literally the only way it could survive.

I'm with you 100%. I got into Bitcoin because I want to help bring banking to the unbanked. High fees will prevent that. For my use cases the fees still make sense but I don't want to prevent other use cases. or user adoption. I do appreciate the focus on people making more efficient use of the blockchain and I think a monetary incentive will encourage that. Is it premature optimization? In my mind it likely is but since there isnt consensus I feel like its important to make the best of the current situation. 
If we get to a point where blocks are always full and the average fee starts rapidly increasing I'm going to be very disapointed. My hope is that happening will put additional pressure on agreement towards on-chain capacity increases, 2nd layer technology, efficiency gains, etc. 
Bitcoin is still much cheaper to use for payments than credit cards (which have a $0.30 minimum fee + percentage) or commercial paypal (which is about the same).  If the average fee gets that high then the pressure to increase the on-chain capacity should be overwhelming.

If the ETF is approved then I think the only possibility of sub 800 Bitcoins is after a legit bubble and then greater than 75% regression. So in other words, I think we would hit $3000+ before we came back down to $800, and that would be the absolute bottom. The possibility of adding Bitcoin to grow tax free in widespread retirement accounts is a legitimate game changer  and a price of $3000 would represent a 15x growth from last stable bottom, which is around typical for Bitcoin bubbles.  
If the ETF fails I don't know where I think the bottom is but my guess is $600-$800.

This is how its been for 3 years. The fact that the other devs haven't gotten behind an alternative plan is not surprising.

They also seem to not care that wallet software is currently not designed for either full blocks or a true fee market. 
In other words there is no alternative plan and no concern for users. They might be greats devs but they suck at building political consensus.

Bitcoin losing a large portion of its value permanently. Not Bitcoin not making enough people rich enough. Not Bitcoin being used for everything under the sun. What people don't seem to understand is that all of bitcoin's value comes from being decentralized.  Ethereum is not as decentralized as Bitcoin, and the only thing that gives either value is being decentralized. Everything that either of them can do can be done more efficiently centralized. All of the value comes from the fact that they aren't centralized. 
And I'll tell you another secret about Ethereum. I think it's cool technology and I hold a very small portion. But during its recent run to all-time highs, the total crypto global market cap was shrinking the entire time. What that means is that all of its gains were coming from speculators moving from Bitcoin (post ETF) to Ethereum, and not from a bunch of new fiat coming into the system. That has several implications. The biggest is that it caps the amount of growth that Ethereum could have had to what would actually be seeded Bitcoin at that moment, and meant that a crash was very eminent, unless you really believe that something with literally one tenth of the community, one hundredth of the developers and 1000th all of the general name recognition was going to take over at that moment. 
I have seen a lot of shit and alt's always seem to pump after Bitcoin hits all-time highs like it just has. I remember $40 Litecoin. None of this shit is new to me. The fact that people are willing to pay a dollar for a transaction shows how valuable the system is. I used to not understand any of this and now it's clear as day.

Just to be clear you believe
A) A less secured chain processing fewer transactions will maintain its value. In addition, users of that chain will pay a proportional increase in fees to offset the reduction in transactional capacity, which is the only reality where a miner's earnings are maintained, (which is necessary because mining has costs).
B) There exists unused dark mining capacity which is not profitable enough to run today but would suddenly be profitable on a minority chain. 
You keep saying reduced competition, but you fail to grasp that there will be no increase in profits over time with static difficulty, because fewer blocks will be found.  Yes a miner will find a higher percentage of found blocks, BUT THEY WILL FIND THE SAME NUMBER OF BLOCKS OVER THE SAME MINING TIME AS BEFORE THE FORK.  Their costs will be the same, reward will be the same, except it will be paid in the value of the minority chain, and even if this was maintained (by users paying 9x the individual fees for 1/9 the available transactions), this would need to continue without any futher mining reduction during the entire multi month retarget period, or that window would expand. There is no incentive to attract other miners because mining is not more profitable because difficulty is static during this time. 
I wish someone else would weigh in.   Do you understand that mining profits do not change during a static difficulty regardless of how many other miners exist and are mining?  Do you understand this one point?  Mining is a random process, with static hashrate and static difficulty if you would normally find 10 blocks over a month then this is true regardless of if you have 100% of network mining power or 1% of it.   Your changing percentage does not get you more blocks, only changing hashrate or difficulty will.

The only thing miners can do is not include transactions. That does not create a "minority hard fork", it just means segwit transations will have to wait for a block that includes them.  This is the power of backwards compatibility. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:19:14
No, it wouldn't.  ETH retargets difficulty every 30 seconds. Bitcoin retargets difficulty every two weeks. A minority chain with present difficulty will turn that 2 weeks into 4-6 months of unprofitable mining (depending on remaining hashrate), which will then increase the adjustment window indefinitely as miners drop off due to unprofitable mining.  In other words, YOU NEVER GET TO THE RETARGET WITHOUT A HARD FORK DECREASING DIFFICULTY.
You can't compare the ETH fork to a potential Bitcoin fork because of how POW is implemented in each. I'm tired of explaining this.

The question is not whether the minority chain has value, the question is whether the value will be profitable enough to prevent existing miners from stopping during the retarget, because the difficulty cannot change to reflect that value.  In a world where electricity and hardware are free, some miners might keep things going for a host of reasons until the difficulty finally reset, but in a world where profitability matters, there likely wouldn't be enough. 
If we assume people are going to mine a less profitable coin at  a loss for a long time then you could be right, but i find this illogical.

Unless you have free electricity you cannot make money mining because you're competing with people who do and who have access to more efficient hardware than what you can buy.

How? The only option besides a soft fork (already in place and just waiting signaling) is a contentious hard fork.  
You think people have more power than they do and you misunderstand Bitcoin completely.
Consider that several core developers have already advocated for varying solutions that do perform a hard fork but that there is not enough support for the fork to not be contentious. Therefore there is no ability to having a non-contentious hard fork, which is what you're advocating for. 
Segwit should be the least contentious option because it's backwards compatible. The fact that it can't get enough support yet pretty much positive proof that there is no ability for any party to change the situation.
By the way this is not a bad thing. Digital gold should be resistant to change. It isn't a coincidence that Bitcoin has been suffering through this problem for years while still hitting all-time highs. 
I'm at the point where I'm pretty much ignoring anyone who clamors about block size and who won't take an easy option that's already in place. Segwit was never contentious, people are just fighting for power and it's bullshit.

They do. With an HD wallet you need to either import all cold storage keys into a single potentially insecure environment at once or generate multiple seeds and track which fund addresses are associated with which specific seeds.  With traditional paper wallets you can divide funds into individual addresses that are not at risk of all being compromised if a single seed is discovered and stolen. 
Paper wallets also do not necessarily promote address reuse.

I consider a massive loss of cryptocurrency marketshare to be an existential danger because it threatens PoW-based security. If we determine that the blocksize limit has increased fees and priced out continued growth, while a competing cryptocurrency has overtaken Bitcoin's adoption, then that is as much of an existential danger as centralization because it threatens the integrity of the system.  
We aren't there yet, but I think there would be quick consensus that constituted an emergency. I hope we never find out.

There are always risk vectors.
What if the unit you bought was from a 3rd party seller on Amazon and is counterfeit.  What if its your first one wasn't but it breaks and you enter your seed (after moving all your coins) into a future one that is.  
What if the random number generation isn't actually random.  This has already happened in Bitcoin wallets. 
What if things are secure now but buggy firmware is released in the future.
I'm not sure whether this applies but is the firmware opensource? Can you verify what is running on the device matches that code?
Hardware wallets are 10000000x better than what we have had before, but if you have serious money you should still diversify some methods / products,  just because there are always possible attacks. 
Also they ARE good enough for Bitcoin to go mainstream. The realistic chance of these concerns is probably less than the chance of you getting killed in your car driving to work.

17.7% was seen as too small at the time because there was no immediate capacity increase.
However, I think its likely it would gain consensus if it was implemented now as part of the upcoming hardfork (waiting until July 2017 before an additional increase over what's planned) AND it would provide a chance of not having to revisit this issue every year. I wish Sipa had proposed segwit as a softfork and then this as the "cleanup" hardfork because even if it doesn't grow fast enough, it grows at a very conservative rate and I think its likely it would have widespread support.

You're forgetting several things.  First, a minority chain will be worth less, decreasing actual dollar value of the reward, but the cost to mine (in electricity) will stay the same. Secondly, A miner's earned reward (in Bitcoin) is the exact same because it is determined by difficulty and not how many other miners there are currently (prior to a future the re target). The total network reward is shrinking  offsetting the miner's larger share. In addition, fewer blocks are being found and fewer transactions are being processed. Unless transaction fees rise even more to compensate, mining is even less profitable, forcing more miners to stop mining. This is the spiral.  90% fewer miners and losing even half the value of the coin and its game over. The remaining profitable miners will keep mining a coin losing value, exasperating the situation. 
Less valuable coin, same difficulty, miners drop off, blocks are found slower, cycle continues. 
A block every 100 minutes means this continues for 7 months until the retarget. During that time, instead of 3 TPS, you get .3 TPS.  Mining will not be profitable, the retarget will not hit, and the chain will die.  
You act like this has never happened with an altcoin before.  ETC was saved by its rapid difficulty reset. Bitcoin would not be as lucky.

You're not understanding what I'm saying. In Ethereum the mining difficulty adjusts every 30 seconds. In Bitcoin that duration is 2 weeks. If the minority chain was say 10% in Bitcoin then it would be completely fucked for 5-6 months.  During this time mining would be unprofitable, leading to a spiral where that adjustment window grows indefinitely until difficulty is hard forked down. Meaning you still don't have the original chain. 
TL;DR a significant technical difference means it would be nothing like Ethereum's fork.

In terms of payments I can see Bitcoin being valuable across borders and when buying items with high fraud risk (e.g. gold) and when privacy is required (e.g. VPN), but for general use it doesn't make a lot of sense to average people in first world nations.  
That doesn't mean its not an incredibly valuable asset.  As a store of value its much more important than a payment system or a type of currency. As programmable money or distributed trust or notary or fraud proof election system or any of the many things it does extremely well  its worth a lot more than its current price,  but this obsession with a payment system is not playing to its strengths or to the largest market need.

When I first read that post months ago I had an immediate negative reaction to it. I believed we were taking for granted our first mover advantage and opening up a massive liability related to competitors. I still think this is a bigger concern than people in Core apparently do, but I also come to decide that what Bitcoin needs to do is what its good at and it needs to do it well. Crypto needs a digital gold that has been engineered to that purpose. 
I think if Greg had better communicated the benefits of layer 2 solutions (microtransactions, instant 'confirmations', increased demand for locked BTC to fund channels, etc) then I think more people would have gotten on board earlier. I think he could have done much better to describe his vision and people would have appreciated the leadership. But ultimately I think his vision is correct. 
I just hope we get there in time and do more to support developers because Bitcoin's competitors are. The best technology doesn't always win. A lot of people hated Windows but it won the desktop wars. Betamax was better than VHS but it lost. MySpace had the network effect and scaled better than Friendster, but it still lost because Facebook built an app platform.

It costs an average of $0.08 to send a bitcoin transaction, which is largely the same as it has been for the last year, regardless of current BTC price. Fees are not high and the fee is the same regardless of the amount transferred.  
A credit card transaction costs $0.30 and 3% of the transaction amount.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 05:13:15
I came here to post the same thing. I'd much rather overpay then worry about shit getting stuck. Unfortunately if everybody has the same attitude that I do fees are going to go dramatically up, which is not a good thing for people that don't have the option to pay as much because they live in Venezuela and they want this to escape their bullshit currency.

I had the exact same thought. If anything I have more confidence in certain exchanges and less in others now.
@_date: 2016-06-07 20:39:24
If that happened then transaction fees will rise, encouraging more mining and speeding up the retarget.

And if that 90% was true with the time that the New York agreement came out it's certainly not currently true for several reasons including obviously that bch has a large amount of mining now. Also without replay protection we have just guaranteed a civil war and a lot of miners are not going to want to go along with that. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:25:36
eh,  sorta.  You really need to look at total transaction fee revenue and not individual fee amount to determine how magnificently bitcoin is succeeding. If miners decided that the block subsidy is so high (and orphan risk is significant) that they only want to include transactions with fees in the dollars range, and the total transaction volume decreases but the individual average fee dramatically rises, that doesn't mean things are great.   
Total transaction revenue (with a related sufficient decentralization) is the most important metric here 
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:17:43
The only way this can actually happen is if nearly all miners (controlling hashrate) and exchanges (influencing name and transactions)  agree and all significant money (from users) moves towards this as the future. If that happens it really doesn't matter what you or I think.  Bitcoin won't have failed, the market will have dictated a path forward.  PS, significant economic interest could change Bitcoin as its the exact thing that has protected Bitcoin.
You've always been one of the most anti hard fork proponents on this subreddit. What are you personally going to do if the thing being bought and sold on coinbase and mined by all significant mining power is referred to as Bitcoin by some majority of its users?  Are you personally out?  Because for me, I'm gonna hold those coins, and whatever core forks with a new POW and difficulty,  which will likely be called legacy Bitcoin on the exchanges.

its not making "my choice for me", its the significance of coinbase as a company with literally millions of users  (most of whom are not familiar with the scaling debate or forks).  If they call S2X  Bitcoin and people buying Bitcoin are buying S2X  then that will have a huge impact on the ultimate resolution of this issue.

1 million in net assets (total assets minus total liabilities). Some definitions and accredited investor status require that to not include your primary residence but it's up to an individual's interpretation. 
I can see the argument both ways actually because if you have a 10 million dollar house and that's all you have and it's not at all liquid you can't really use it for anything except for maybe income generation if you rented it and lived somewhere else, but on the flip side if you sold it for 10 million and then rented an apartment you'd be a deca millionaire, so both definitions kind of makes sense. 
OP FWIW I consider you a millionaire regardless of your house situation as long as your other assets cover your current tax liabilities ;-)

The equity round I believe was in early 2012. The price of BTC was around $5 at the time. For a $2750 investment you would have 550 Bitcoins, which would be worth a little over $2 million today ($3700 combined btc and bch value). 
It would also be completely liquid, unlike the coinbase investment.
TL;DR just buying and hodling Bitcoins has been even better than investing in the most successful company in the industry.

Dude its not a small security risk! In order to sweep an address you have to expose the key to the computer / phone. If the key's value is so much that you don't want to sweep all of it, then it should be so much that you don't want it to still be useful after the initial operation.

There are 4 reasons people should DCA with crypto 
1) Because they are generally hearing about it and / or buying it first during a ATH, and without DCA they simply won't buy all they way down like they need to when it corrects. DCA removes emotion. The people who used it during the last bubble to $1300 (and all the way back down to $170) are very happy
2) Because every day that crypto survives its user base goes up and overall risk goes slightly down, thereby making it a slightly better long term bet. Its not like the stock market was going to disappear one day, but there has been a long period where cryptos future was less than certain. 
3) A lot of people in debt unfortunately think of things in terms of monthly expenses (rent / mortgage, car payment). DCA gives them a way to get involved in those terms.
4) Volatility is higher in crypto then equities. Again this goes back to emotion but trying to ignore it means setting up more investors for failure. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:05:52

@_date: 2016-12-28 03:02:42
Oh god no. The only people who are currently at a loss with BTC are the ones who went all in, once and only once, back in Nov 2013.  DCA is the way to go with Bitcoin and anyone who has done it has already made money.
Deferred buying schemes are a tool to lower limit initial exposure, which makes a lot of sense when many new people are first hearing about BTC during a bull run.  
Transaction costs are usually a percentage of buy total  (eg 1% on coinbase). There is no increased cost due to DCA.

@_date: 2017-08-29 15:43:25
Fuck no dude. Take it from someone who has been around this for a while. Most bubbles ultimately retrace 80-90%. 80% down from $5000 is $1000. 
If you think I'm full of shit, go look up the last 5-6 bubbles. At least 4-5 of them lost 80%+ from peak. 
Nobody knows what will happen but if history repeats then the most likely thing is we will lose 40% in a crash. Then pop back up 20%. Then slow bleed 50%+ more of that for quite a while. 
The only question really is how high does it go before this all starts. Right now we are up 30x from the last low of $170. This has all happened before and it will all happen again. 
This time IS NEVER different. You are writing this literally years into a bull market. We WILL get a major correction at some point, and your guess is as good as mine whether that is tomorrow or at $30,000 per coin.

What's really risky is trying to time the market.  People who have been dollar cost averaging into Bitcoin (starting virtually any point in its history, including at the previous peak) have made a lot of money. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:08:53
No. Dollar cost averaging means you have been buying in steady intervals and are in profit already. 
The only way you aren't in profit is if you only bought once (and only once), right at the 2013 peak, or if you did something stupid like sell.

Yes they will because the subsidy will decrease and fees have always existed despite effectively unlimited blocksize.
So yes, eventually, fees will be larger than the block subsidy regardless of blocksize. 
Now the question is, will the fees be enough for security, and the answer is, yes they will be because security will always be a ratio to total value. As value increases, efforts to protect that value will also increase. 
So what we should be trying to do is to increase the total value of Bitcoin  (in users and use cases) so that we increase the total value of the system and thus the security its participants provide. 
Or maybe people think that a limited coin with fewer use cases and users will still have lots of value and security magically. 
Believe this, the current price is based on a belief that Bitcoin as a system will continue to grow. Higher transaction fees will not benefit growth. Instead, something else will replace Bitcoin.

Edit: if you disagree with me and prefer something that has lower resource requirements in exchange for less functionality, that's fine, but realize that users CAN run a full node on a VPS for a trivial amount of money today, even if they have shit broadband at home, and this would still be true with 200x current blocksizes.

You just completely missed the point which is that computing gets cheaper constantly. A 16TB SSD would have cost $30,000 two years ago.
The cost for disk space to run completely full 8MB blocks for 10 years is currently $130 and rapidly droping. That's for 10 whole years of completely full blocks using today's money and costs. 
Anyone can run a full node on a VPS for $5 a month or less. Maybe not on DSL in the middle of fucking nowhere but definitely for very small costs.

@_date: 2015-07-07 16:58:45
I disagree with you simply because up until very recently blocks have NEVER been full and transactions have always been very cheap / free. We would still have projects like Ethereum ready to take on larger security risks. 
The blocksize is not currently holding Bitcoin back, it only will when transactions cost a non trivial amount. That time is coming very quickly but it hasn't started yet. 
Personally, I believe that so long as Bitcoin is sufficiently decentralized (meaning at least 1-2 hundred nodes around the world), we should enable the largest amount of usage that level of decentralization supports. I think there would still be hundreds of nodes today with 100MB blocks.

Some people are worried about mining consolidation if miners have total control over maximum blocksize like they do with difficulty. Big miners pushing out smaller miners. It means that running a full node (for validating your own transactions) has a variable and unknown maximum cost. 
I don't share these concerns for a number of reasons, but I'm just explaining the push back on that idea. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:46:01
Here's why I'm not concerned about that. Its not truley tragedy of the commons. I have a financial stake in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin was to get too centralized, I would personally bring up additional nodes to protect my own financial stake. If mining became too centralized, the same thing would happen. The participants do not reap equal benefits from the system because they have unequal investments in it, and as such the larger participants have a greater incentive to protect it.

@_date: 2015-07-31 19:10:35
I don't have time to get into it, maybe someone else can. But the fear is that commercial miners get huge blocks that home users can't support without fiber bandwidth. Or running a node becomes so expensive that fewer people do it because they aren't making money like miners are and things consolidate. 
I'm not worried about the upper bound limits on ANY of these proposals because of historical computing performance increases.

It's amazing how after years of thinking litecoin has no real value it may become the closest thing to bitcoin with segwit enabled. On top of that it's trivial to port the developing lightning Network
Compared to ETH it will have much better decentralisation, already set and understood economic parameters, and a longer history. 
Compared to dash it will have no pre mine.
And compared to virtually all of the major coins it's nowhere near its all-time high right now.

Currently the block reward is 25 BTC for about 1200 transactions per block. That means that for each transaction there is a miner security fee of about $8 (USD). 
Should a Bitcoin transaction cost another $0.10-$0.15 on top of that as it does right now while the network is growing? Do we envision a Bitcoin future where an individual transaction costs $5-$10 in the absence of the block subsidy? I really hope not.

REDACTED is not a split. Thats not how consensus works.

@_date: 2016-02-17 18:48:22
So, explain to me how this works for me as a user. I move some portion of my coins to a "payment channel provider", for a transaction fee, with crypto protecting me so that I get them back at some point in the future if that provider screws me. Then I can spend them, fee free (or cheap, the provider has to make money now), to everyone that provider has an agreement with or everyone who has an agreement with a provider that my provider has an agreement with? 
I'm trying to understand how things work for a user where the majority of payments are handled by lightning networks. I have to send my coins to someone to open a channel right? So I use the channel when I'm doing lots of transactions and when the providers fee is less than the cumulative transaction fees would be directly, and when the people im paying have an agreement with my provider. Is that right?
@_date: 2016-02-21 22:27:43
Yes and like you've said, this is all unavoidable with PoW. The question is whether this a fatal problem and ultimately i don't think we know yet. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:00:28
Its a bit complicated. The reason the coins are lost is because the UASF chain is a valid chain for all nodes and a reorg will erase the blocks which did not signal for segwit, wiping out the coins generated from those blocks.  This is a (potential) chainsplit, which is slightly different from a hardfork in that a 51% "victory" on one side specifically will wipe out the other side.   
Its not a hardfork because unupgraded nodes ARE NOT kicked out, just unsignaling blocks. This is a crucial point to understand. If Segwit activates then the UASF chain "wins", old (in fact all) nodes then believe in that chain, and all blocks between August 1st and whenever Segwit activates that are not part of that chain are gone. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 22:13:03

Based on what?  Where did I say that? Don't put words in my mouth. Bitcoin's competitors are other cryptocurrencies. 


Seqwit allows them because they are safe. However, by discounting the witness data in the manner that the current soft fork will we are ensuring that almost no blocks will actually be that size. In other words, we are wasting available capacity.

I've never been sure why anyone thinks the classic team would replace the core team. Classic is a patch containing a 2MB max blocksize upgrade and some logic to protect the network from malicious transitions. It activates only if a super majority of miners express support for it.  
It is simply a choice for the ecosystem regarding only what the patch  contains. It exerts a pressure on Bitcoin to progress (in some way) by existing, regardless of if it ever becomes a majority. 
Gavin and Jeff have given people a choice. Even if everyone here thinks its the wrong choice, these developers listened to what (some)  users asked for and made it available. They are acting according to their principles and that is not a bad thing. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:24:10
I'm not but (in the future) I'd still like a blockchain with 1000 times the capacity  that exist today for the same reason I want a hard drive with this 1000 times the capacity that exist today. It opens up more use cases for the future. That has nothing to do with whether or not we have multiple tiers. 
The more usage on the blockchain itself the more people who have an interest in protecting that blockchain.
 If I never need to use the blockchain ( because all of my transactions require third parties and payment channels) then I have no reason to run a full node at all and Bitcoin will be much more centralized both in terms of usage and total node counts. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 22:30:51

Yeah I really love that idea because it's not like miners invested hundreds of millions of dollars into Bitcoin's security and have a tremendous amount to lose (as the block subsidy decreases) if adoption doesn't increase.
Yes miners have to follow the rules but saying miners have no involvement in a hard fork is just fantasy. Also, what does that say to anyone investing in Bitcoin's security in the future

In order to pull off a Sybil attack, you need to have all connections to an honest node be to peers which you control. This is the connection to node counts. The more of the network you control, the easier it is to fool a node into thinking your version of the network is the correct version. But UASF is specifically about economic influence, you could only have the exchange nodes run it and it would exert that influence, without attempting to control all peers for a node. 
Its not about fooling a node, its about saying "our version of the network looks like this, connect to which ever peers you want but this is how we see the world".  
If I run a node then I get to decide which rules that node follows. A soft fork is simply a tightening of rules (which is why its always backwards compatible). If your node doesn't agree with my tighented rules then the chain is going to split. But im not going to try to influence your reality, I'm just not going to interact with you in any way other than to present mine.  And if my version ends up being "correct"  (ie has the most work behind it AND fits your protocol requirements - this is key) then youre eventually going to agree and your reality is going to be changed. 
Soft forks have been usually (but not exclusively) coordinated through hash rate. But they don't have to be. Miners simply do not control the protocol, they just sometimes play a part in tightening it. But if tightening it is against their individual or short term interests, but it benefits the users and the economic majority overall, then an impasse is going to be created and another method is going to be used. This is that method. 
Me running software that only accepts blocks which I agree to is my free choice. Its not extortion. If exchanges and other users only want those blocks then oh well, I don't owe the miners anything. They work for the network, its not the other way around.

This is not extortion. This is me saying that my software will not recognize your blocks if they do not meet certain conditions. Thats my right as a user running the software. Miners can create whatever blocks they want, but if they want my software to accept them, then they need to meet specific requirements. If they dont care about me or my software or the other people who agree then they can do whatever they want.  Thats free choice, not extortion.

Do they allow for non Bitcoin blockchains to provide utility that would (sometimes) otherwise need to be provided by the bitcoin blockchain, while utilizing the security of the bitcoin blockchain?  Isn't that the whole point?
In other words, do they help usage go off of the bitcoin blockchain, and thus is that not a scaling mechanism? 
I'm not asking you whether they make Bitcoin more efficient or decentralized. Reducing pressure on onchain transactions IS a scaling mechanism.

If bandwidth is the limiting factor in block size right now, since CPU validation has already so impressively improved, does this mean the network could easily support 20 MB blocks right now if this is implemrnted?
Because if that's the case then literally everybody should be able to be satisfied with capacity and performance.

OP I might not write down the last word of the ledger seed if you're really afraid of it getting stolen, and then you just remember that word, but i'd still duplicate the (rest of ) the seed in multiple places just in case. 
Honestly though 12 random words written down in multiple places probably wouldnt get stolen unless someone knew it was a bitcoin seed.  My bigger worry would be forgetting it.

Yeah, its a little bit more complicated then just boosting MAXBLOCKSIZE, but thats because its actually going to do something real and significant. Like to make it so we don't have 10-30 minute confirmation times when buying a coffee. Like making it so every node doesn't have to store that coffee purchase until the heat death of the universe. Like making subcent (or satoshi) microtransactions viable. Like making it so individual transactions are very cheap (or free) while protecting decentralization.
This is what real progress looks like, one release at a time.

Personally I think we should look at BIP103 again. When it first came out (2 years ago) I thought that the growth rate of 17% was too slow. 
Now I think that it plus a modified segwit would be a workable compromise.
Also it would be kind of beautiful if the two things that Peiter Wuille worked hard on ended up combining into the solution.
Segwit + 17% (capped).  Figure out a way to do it in a soft fork and lets move foward.

I'd rather Bitcoin be more useful and adopted then to be limited to what can run on my smart watch.  
If Bitcoin ever got to the point where an average user couldn't run a full node for a trivial cost then we would have a problem. We are so far from that right now.

Of course,  everyone who runs a UASF node and tells exchanges / businesses that they will only interact with UASF nodes is putting their money where their mouth is. These businesses have already invested a tremendous amount of time and money in getting Segwit-ready and they will be supportive.

Simple questions and I just want to know if I have a basic understanding
1. With the lightening network will I need to open a payment channel (first by paying a transaction fee) and then tie up the bitcoins that I later intend to spend for such a time as necessary until I have spent them? 
2. When those are exhausted In that sense, will I then need to repeat the process, opening another channel and paying another transaction fee?
3. Ultimately then is this analogous to buying a "Bitcoin" gift card? 
4. Is the payment channel bidirectional  (do I get to  use this same channel for spending and receiving)?
Thank you to whoever understands this better than I do
Edit: 
1) Dear auto downvoter, you're a loser and despite your efforts nearly all of my posts have positive Karma. I hope you're discovered and banned from reddit forever.
2)  Trying to answer my own questions I found this -
"The Lightning Network has problems with exchanging significant amounts of value.  For the Lightning Network to function, it requires that users and businesses lock up as much bitcoin as they would ever expect to transact over a given period of time.  For the micro-transaction use case, this isn’t a big deal.  Locking up $5 or $10 worth of value is obviously not a problem.  However, if you wanted to ‘only open one channel every six months’, as the Lightning Network slide deck suggests is a ‘reasonable use case’, things begin to fall apart.  For someone to only open one Lightning Network channel every six months, would mean that channel would have to lock up the maximum amount of value the user would ever hold over that period of time.  First of all, this would require a level of trust in the network which I have already noted will take a long time to achieve.  Second, it doesn’t seem practical that in a world where people get their paychecks roughly, on average, every two weeks, that they would be ready, willing, or able to lock up all of the funds they might want to use for a six month period.  You essentially have to think of the Lightning Network as a pre-paid debit card.  You have to fund it up front, you have to guess how much you are going to need, and whenever you run out, you are going to have to top it off again.  There is no scenario where it seems practical that people will only want to open a single channel once every six months."
I don't see how this is going to work as a currency.

If the BIP148 chain gets the majority, the non BIP148 chain will not exist indefinitely because the BIP148 chain will be a longer valid PoW chain and will cause the other chain to be orphaned. This is not like in Ethereum.  The only way that both chains exist indefinitely is if the BIP148 chain forever stays in the minority and continues to be mined. This is certainly a possible outcome, as even if miners are willing to signal for the Segwit, a majority may not be willing to build on the BIP148 chain, even if BIP148 nodes are all orphaning the chain that they are instead building on. 
Unfortunately, just signalling for Segwit does not get you on both chains. It gets you accepted by all nodes, but if youre on a minority chain you have to chose which chain to mine on.  I wrote a game theory post about this yesterday and then last night it dawned on me that BIP148 miners have a risk of the chain forever staying in the minority.

But it IS vague. If there can't be a date then there could at least have been suggested metrics listed.
Without either it might as well not even exist because it doesn't really mean anything.
But on the actual topic of risk I think it's likely that the network can support a maximum of 4 megabyte blocks already because hypothetically worst-case SW will permit that. And that's today. So even if absolutely no additional Bitcoin related performance increases are obtained in next 17 (!) months before this would become active, computing will also continue to advance as it always has.
There is a lot to be gained for building some consensus, trust, and a real target.

We are going to find out if higher security is ultimately true. It has the highest sha(256) hashing asic network concentrated in a ridiculously small number of hands. That's not great. 
All PoW is subject to centralization forces. Some other coins might do a much better job (right now) fighting those forces because of different PoW choices that were made in their creation. If thats true, they could ultimately win because they will both have higher real security and lower transactions costs (as a result of a better resistance towards centralization while allowing for higher usage).

I don't think you understand because I didn't expand on this point. Its not just the users boycott, its that the exchanges coins will be invalidated and they will lose a ton of money in a re-org.   If Miner A sells his mined coins to Coinbase, and a reorg happens wiping out those blocks, Coinbase loses a ton of money. So now Coinbase has  a huge incentive to not accept coins from blocks that aren't signaling because there is a financial risk otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 14:48:34

It lets nodes have known fixed maximum costs. I agree that its also extremely conservative (especially given the time it would theoretically take to get to 32MB blocks) but it balances miner "power" with node operator "power".

Listen to me very closely. The number and types of upgrades that can happen to Bitcoin through soft forking only are extremely limited and do not justify the current value of the ecosystem. 
If Bitcoin cannot be upgraded it will be replaced by something that can. Bitcoin will become niche and much less valuable (than it is today) because its current price is based on the belief that it will continue to be improved.  
A hardfork to fix the nonce issue is not the same as a hardfork to increase the coin limit and comparing the two is ridiculous.

A first mover's advantage is negated by an inability to adapt. 
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:48:00
The entire reasoning behind having smaller blocks is to lower compute requirements to encourage decentralization. More specifically, it is to support people running nodes from their homes (even if they have bullshit broadband speeds or live in poorly connected countries), because if nodes are going to be run instead in  datacenters then blocksizes can be much larger and Bitcoin can have higher transactional capacity supporting more usage and use cases. 
In other words, there is a tradeoff between utility and decentralization. And that's all great, but if more usage is pushed off of the blockchain then who is still running the nodes and why? Is it "banks" in datacenters? 
If so did we end up in the same place with a less useful Bitcoin? Yup we sure did. 
We need to fix the incentives (to encourage decentralization) or Bitcoin is fucked. Keeping compute resources small isn't enough.

As if any of that shit had anything to do with centralization and not cheap power and manufacturing in China. Let's be honest here.
Or were you were talking about full nodes counts and not mining? Then that would be due to the fact that Bitcoin users derive effectively no value from running full nodes, regardless of computational requirements. So the calculus becomes "well we can't make running nodes more useful, but we can make running nodes cheaper at the cost of utility and adoption of the underlying asset".
Brilliant.

I think its pretty shitty that forever the biggest argument against non segwit solutions has been that hard forks won't get consensus and here we have a proposal that is a soft fork and people are shooting it down because its not their preferred solution.  
I want Segwit, I'm interested in seeing how much of the economic majority gets behind UASF, but goddamnit can we at least be honest and give proposals some actual review.
The knee jerk "not invented here" syndrome is disgusting.  As of today Segwit alone does not look like it will gain consensus.  We have no idea whether UASF will get consensus. We need to continue to look at options until one gains consensus. This might be a step forward because its the first time something might have greater mining support and isn't a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:24:06
Which is why UASF is frankly brilliant. Users have effectively no risk, miners have lots and lots of risk if they don't signal.  Exchanges also have huge re-org risk if they accept coins mined from non-signaling blocks. The incentive to signal is going to grow significantly. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:38:34
Following the developments of today it actually feels like consensus **will** happen. Core will work towards and communicate a more concrete roadmap (regarding the hardfork) within the next 21 days and if they fail to then  ecosystem now has an alternative patch with some miners ready to start testing it now. 
I welcome the day when we are on the same team again with a plan that the super majority of the ecosystem supports. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 05:23:12
So schedule THAT non controversial hardfork now. Let's get experience with these for the future by doing a low risk one that has consensus now. 
If the hold up on the block size increase hardfork is uncertainty about progress regarding weak blocks then let's get a non block size related fork scheduled. Then the following fork can increase the max block size and improve seg wit. It will take just as much time but we will have even more experience and confidence.

I'm probably going to butcher this a little bit but to stay with the analogy the way this works is you had a program that that you sent ahead of time that verifies that the encrypted data is in fact star wars. The data that they send (the copy of star wars) is verified using your program, then its encrypted and sent to you. The process of decrypting that data (sent to you) also pays them.

No, thats not how this works. Miners already use a centralized relay, the nodes have no effect on their actual block propagation. 


It makes no difference. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:36:03
So just to be clear, a larger transactional capacity, which results in cheaper transactions, which encourages more users and use cases (read: stakeholders), which drives more adoption, which benefits the network effect (being maybe the most important part of a money) makes Bitcoin weaker and weaker. 
Got it. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:24:19
UASF guarantees that Segwit will activate  (either with or without a chainsplit). Shapeshift risks losing lots of money by accepting coins from blocks mined after August 1st where the blocks do not signal for Segwit  (because of an eventual re-org).

you have to admit, its interesting how very little differentiation is actually suddenly a good thing. For years Litecoin literally was just a very similar copy, and now that similarity is to its benefit because of how easy porting existing Segwit-dependent code will be.  Litecoin goes from "so close to Bitcoin its not valuable" to "the closest thing to Bitcoin  (e.g no premine, history, good decentralization) that ALSO has Segwit enabled". 
In other words, people who might not have cared for Litecoin now get "Almost Bitcoin plus Segwit", so of course its looked on more favorably now and is also more valuable.

Just because one chain allows for signaling and non signaling blocks does not mean it will necessarily be in the majority. Miners can only mine on one chain.
@_date: 2017-04-17 19:40:36
Uh, the miners can only help upgrade the protocol to support additional kinds of transactions. 
They can't make other economic decisions. They can't print more Bitcoins. They don't set interest rates. 
Also, they aren't actually even necessary for upgrading the protocol, and in fact many protocol upgrades have happened on flag days and not using miner signaling. If the miners work against the interests of the users, the users will eventually override them.

I bought into Bitcoin years ago based on my reading of the whitepaper, the scaling wiki, and other texts available at that time.

The maximum blocksize limit was enabled concurrently by the inventor of Bitcoin with an explanation that it would eventually be raised. Now, **nearly five and a half years later**, a sizable portion of the Bitcoin economy wants that exact thing to happen.

To be honest with you, it's taking me a little bit to really understand UASF and I realize now that a lot of people have other misconceptions. A lot of people think it's a sybil attack based on number of nodes or voting, or that it's just a normal hardfork where the losing chain still has value.  It's only recently that I'm really getting the implications of all of this and I'm guessing the exchanges haven't realized what's going on yet either.  The next month is going to be very interesting.

It doesnt guarentee a chainsplit. The only way a chainsplit occurs is if segwit is not activated by august 1st AND if BIP148 is not the majority chain. 
That's completely possible. But it doesn't simply "break compatibility with ordinary segwit compatible nodes".  That is the net effect when it follows a seperate chain (from normal segwit nodes) if neither of the above conditions is met. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:42:38

Hard forks break backwards compatibility and force people to accept rules that they didn't intially agree to. They are only appropriate in an emergency or where there's true consensus. Unfortunately segwit in a hard fork will never have true concensus because people think they are unnecessarily risky. So segwit in a soft fork with effectively 2.1MB blocks is the best chance for consensus. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:51:27
If thats true and we assume a lead time of 12 months that means that we will be into spring of 2018 (at the earliest) before a hard fork. 
We need to be "working out the details of the 2MB hard fork" by this fall at the latest so that the actual fork can happen by late 2017. Thats 18 months from now. 
@_date: 2016-02-16 14:01:23
The plan, as stated by the creator of the technology himself when he put the limit in place, has been to increase the max block size eventually when needed. It has been five and a half years since that plan was communicated. Many early adopters and investors bought in under that plan.
Despite blocks not being completely full, the average transaction costs about $0.10 right now. There is an additional $8 per transaction in block reward subsidy. There is no good reason to encourage even higher transaction costs especially while Bitcoin only still has a few million users
If someone is going to sell their coins because the original plan is being followed then so be it. I and other investors are going to buy more. And miners have more at stake than almost anybody and they want to raise the limit.

At this point it's pretty clear there are only two camps. People who want to see a hard fork and people who don't. 
Segwit provides for blocks over 2MB (2.1 on average based on current usage). That's the compromise.  It's been tested for months. Much of the ecosystem has already paid to upgrade software for it. It can go now instead of in another year.  It fixes a crucial bug.  Its backwards compatible (unlike any other compromises). 
Anyone who says they want more transaction capacity but who rejects Segwit only wants one thing and that's control. They are also delusional about how shitty Bitcoin actually is in it's current state for normal payments. 10 minute block times and no support for micro transactions completely sucks. 
Segwit is the compromise. We are going to activate it via a user initiated soft fork. If we can get over 51% signaling for segwit then that process will actually be safe, but regardless it's going to happen.

All I want Greg Maxwell to do is to add an estimate (either to the core roadmap or while speaking only as himself) of when he thinks its likely, given even the most conservative of estimates, that there will be a hard fork.

If he believes it won't happen until into 2018 or later then I wish he would be public about that belief.

And fewer transactions would actually increase the price per transaction of security.
My point is there is absolutely no free loading going on right now. Bitcoin has a relatively high inflation rate and that all goes to miners providing security. The amount on average right now is $8 per transaction.

 Lightning could make bitcoin much more valuable not only through enabling new use cases like microtransactions but because the required Bitcoins will be tied up while channels are open, creating additional demand for the bitcoins that doesn't currently exist now. 
I want on chain transactions to always be inexpensive (for a large variety of reasons) but that doesn't mean that the blockchain is or has ever been the right tool for microtransactions.
@_date: 2016-02-21 17:06:59
Yeah, I disagree. If "the community" changed PoW then it would mean there is hundreds of millions of dollars worth of "Bitcoin" mining equipment which could no longer mine "Bitcoin". In that case, I'm still with the coin, whatever its now called, which has hundreds of millions of dollars in security equipment behind it.  
Also if you think a blocksize issue is contentious, the migration off of the current PoW system would be effectively impossible. Whatever thing or things that would exist after that schism, it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.
Miners are also not simply at the mercy of users  (which, btw they are users and some who have the highest stakes). They are extremely influential in the future of Bitcoin. Miners can stop transactions through mining empty or small blocks. Miners can prevent softfork adoption. Acting like they don't deserve a seat at the table is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 05:25:05
Also in this case coinjaf is rude as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:04:12
Some miners will not want to risk their blocks being invalidated, so they will signal. They don't have to signal for UASF, just Segwit for their blocks to be protected, but as Segwit signaling rises, the risk of not signaling also continues to rise, which means the incentive to signal continues to increase. As time goes on the financial loses increase too. 
Its not about the majority or minority of nodes, its the financial risk in having those coins wiped out if the segwit chain becomes and stays the majority.  That risk is shared by both miners and exchanges. 
Let me illustrate this better.  Say Segwit still has only its current level of support on August 1st of 30% (I predict it will be higher because it continues rising but whatever).   Now of the 70% of miners not signaling for it, say only a 20% of those miners see the eventual risk in a re-org and begin signaling on August 1st.  Now Segwit has 44% support and here is where things get really interesting. A miner who is not signaling will lose all newly generated coins if the Segwit chain eventually wins (which at this point it only needs 7% more support to win) . As time goes on, those loses grow (since more blocks are passing). The financial risk and negative outcome risk are growing. So more miners will signal. Soon the number will surpass 50%. At this point the pressure for signaling will become overwhelming, and the downside to signaling will continue to be minimal.

If Shapeshift refuses to accept coins from the non segwit signaling chain (after August 1st), which Shapeshift absolutely should if they don't want to risk losing a ton of money in an eventual chain re-org, that will add pressure to miners to signal.

There are things that can only be fixed by a hardfork. Many of these things are not controversial and have complete consensus. A successful hardfork will both improve Bitcoin and will demonstrate that a network upgrade is possible.

What if we did a hardfork with SW and a 2MB blocksize but we did not discount the witness data at all, and scheduled it 6-9 months from now?
Can someone tell me why thats a bad idea. Blocks would actually be smaller than worse case SW, classic supporters would get their 2MB for all transactions, SW lovers would get SW enabled (and cleaner in a hard fork), and the network is actually even safer. 
What is wrong with this idea?

@_date: 2016-02-10 14:46:51


Its not easy to understand because in the 90s I had to wait hours to download an mp3 and now I can stream 4k movies to my living room. The idea that computing **will never** advance to the point where the blockchain can support 10,000 tps is ABSURD. 


Because users previously needed to run a full node to have a Bitcoin wallet and now they do not. Users have very little incentive to run a full node regardless of compute requirements. This misalignment is Bitcoin's biggest problem right now because if it was fixed, we'd have sufficient decentralization forever. 
We need to give users a beneficial reason to run a full node that compensates for the cost in doing so and until we do, this will continue to be an issue.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:01:01
If the incentives were set up right then users would derive enough value from running nodes to offset the cost of running those nodes just like what happens in mining. This would be infinitely more useful then trying to keep the computational requirements to an absolute minimum.
Having said that I think the work that greg is doing is extremely important. Bitcoin is going to need bigger blocks even as a settlement system with the majority of transactions happening off chain and any work that makes  performance better is crucial

Well, you now have a minimum of 17 months before a fork, and that fork will be to parameters that appear to be safe today as they limit the actual blocksize maximum to the same that is being implemented in seg wig.

We finally after many many years have an actual date when we will have a HF network upgrade and its still an incredible 17 more months into the future
And we have 80% of mining pool and a very influential and important part of core in rough agreement.

@_date: 2016-02-17 18:49:55
I posted this above but maybe you can help me understand how it works. Is this all correct below?
I move some portion of my coins to a "payment channel provider", for a transaction fee, with crypto protecting me so that I get them back at some point in the future if that provider screws me. Then I can spend them, fee free (or cheap, the provider has to make money now), to everyone that provider has an agreement with or everyone who has an agreement with a provider that my provider has an agreement with?
I'm trying to understand how things work for a user where the majority of payments are handled by lightning networks. I have to send my coins to someone to open a channel right? So I use the channel when I'm doing lots of transactions and when the providers fee is less than the cumulative transaction fees would be directly, and when the people im paying have an agreement with my provider. Is that right?

That doesn't make sense because we had transaction fees before blocks were full. 


But that would increase orphan rates to nodes located farther away with regard to mining occurring closer to those nodes. 
I think smaller blocks are an advantage to China because of the great firewall and I don't think China needs more advantages at this point.

Yes and it's hilarious the way Peter picks up on this like it's the greatest sin ever stating that. It's possible that it could stay proof of work forever or it could be hybrid of proof of work and proof of stake or it could be something else. It's even more funny because Peter later uses something like proof of stake to suggest how people feel about a potential hard fork. Obviously thats not in the context of securing the blockchain but it's literally in the context of determining consensus.
Nothing is better than proof of work right now. It also uses a tremendous amount of electricity.

Nobody individually is in charge. Bitcoin is a consensus protocol. Without getting into semantics that doesn't mean that it is fully ungovernable. Consensus continually emerges from participant actions and consensus building exercises can replace direct governance. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:27:42
This is actually hard to give advice on. 
Do you have any other assets or is that basically it? I'll assume that's everything you have. So then right now you have about $11,000 worth of assets. That's probably good enough for at least 4-6 months worth of living expenses in most parts of the country (maybe even a little more depending on how you do it). 
Usually that would be my minimum amount of "oh shit" money that I'd want someone to have before buying any other investments. When you think about it like that, and you figure its made worst by the fact that you won't have a job right when you get out, it would make me be more conservative. 
The flip side is though, I know if I was in prison and bitcoin went to the moon and I had some I'd be really happy to know that when I got out I was getting a windfall. On top of that, you mention "safer than cash" which makes me think you don't want to (or can't) open a bank account and don't have anyone you can trust to not spend the money, and you also don't think you can hide it.  In that case you could convert it all to bitcoin, print out a paper wallet on bitaddress.org, and use bip 38 to encrypt it (DO NOT LOSE THAT PASSWORD!!!!!!!!), and print out a couple copies in places you know will still be there. As long as you can get a copy when you get out and remember that password, no one on earth but you could spend it. That's really powerful in that situation. 
So basically if having cash stolen is more likely in your head then having bitcoin going to 0, and you prefer that risk / reward, then yea i'd probably move it into bitcoin. If you can trust someone with the cash, or can open a bank account, then the most i'd personally go (into btc) is 50/50 like you have now because (me personally) i wouldn't want to come out with nothing  if bitcoin lost a significant percent of its market cap, and then you still have some exposure if it goes high. That $5000 in cash would be enough to get going no matter what. 
I'm fairly risk adverse in life, so take that under consideration. Good luck, and I hope it goes to the moon so you can come out smiling.

Its not just about impeding propagation, its about splitting the chain, making it more important to be on the chain accepting the segwit blocks if you think that chain will eventually win and not be re-org'd because the blocks mined on the other chain will be orphaned and their payments made invalid.

What you're saying is true (and I understand it) but we don't know which chain will be in the majority. Just because one chain allows for signaling and non signaling blocks does not mean it will necessarily be in the majority. Miners can only mine on one chain. After August 1st they have to make a choice, and they have to orphan the other chain they are then competing with.

I don't understand the incentive to me, a "Bitcoin" user, to run a node where all of my use is through 3rd parties. 
How does that help with decentralization?
I'm genuinely asking here because I don't understand the thought process. 
**If you push users towards payment channels, why do they ever run nodes?**
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:51:29
So if that's true then why do we need a block size at all?
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:00:49
We've been having this debate for at least 3 years. There is still no hard fork date even on the roadmap. That is unacceptable. Blocks are very close to being full and there is no room left if they become full. That is a significant change from the current system and there is nothing conservative about maintaining that stance. 
Upping the blocks to 2MB will not solve the scaling issue, but it will prove that Bitcoin can adapt when its time. And a lot of people think its time. 
The fact that classic exists gives the ecosystem a choice. It ultimately doesn't matter if the fork never happens, there is always an option now and a pressure to maintain capacity (with an alternative if that fails).
 I'd prefer if we could get 95% of people (or more) agreeing on a plan. I'm hopeful that core will provide more detail to their roadmap.

Also core CANNOT successfully fork without community consensus. They have never had community consensus. Bitcoin being successfully attacked would strongly incentivize consensus.

There are a bunch of reasons this is not going to happen. but let's pretend for a minute it did and Bitcoin got attacked severly by miners who believe they can make more money shorting Bitcoin then hoping the price recovered and they could mine profitably again. Let's say that they also had massive bank accounts for both shorting and running their equipment unprofitably. Do you know what would happen in this instance (which is actually similar to what would happen if a nation-state eventually attacked Bitcoin)?
Core would change the proof of work algorithm and render all that mining investment worthless and literally the entire industry and community would back then. Might be a great excuse to get us all back to gpus and mining decentralization.

This is my personal belief only but I believe that it was both of them working together and the reason "satoshi" stopped was because Hal got ALS. Whether Nick still has the keys to the "satoshi" coins no one has any idea  but consider that since the taxes due on the Bitcoin Cash fork would likely require that some of the original satoshi coins be sold (since they would be quite substantial), its likely those coins won't be spent in the future.
Beyond this hypothesis I truly hope we never find out the full story because bitcoin is better without a known leader.

My problem is that we won't actually get effective block room for another 3-6 months, the room that we get will be minimal, and then we won't get any additional room until currently july of 2017.  During this period there will be a halving and real transaction usage will spike, using bitcoin will become unnecessarily expensive, and competitors will get a completely avoidable window. 
The network can safely support more capacity today and we should be making it available immediately. No one has demonstrated significant problems with block sizes under 4mb and during the time we've been debating this there have been significant performance upgrades across the board. It used to take me a week to sync the blockchain and i can now do it in 10 hours. We are being too conservative and fees are already double what were predicted. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:43:37
That's not what caused 2014. A normal market cycle and correction caused 2014. 5000% gains the year before caused 2014.  The actual bottom came long long after gox.

Of course it will fall behind some in terms of growth, that's what it means to already have a value of over a hundred billion dollars. 
In terms of crypto Bitcoin is lower on the risk scale and also on the rewards scale and that's okay. 
And yes there was tons of attention in 2013. Just like there will be long in the future when there is another bubble

I think $1150 is the theoretical floor and $1750 is a possible likely bottom,  but I also won't be surprised if it doesn't go under $2100 even during a long bear market.

There is no ETF. GBTC is not an ETF. Its trading way over NAV strictly because it is not an ETF. Are there ways to get Bitcoin into investment accounts like self directed IRAs? Sure, but its not the same and its not easy. 
It wont be worth pennies in a few years because I will buy all of them long before that. Its not mania, I have been involved in this space for a long time and I have been through many bubbles and crashes. China banning Bitcoin was already old in 2014. Just because this is the first rodeo for a lot of new people does not mean it is the first rodeo for all of us.   I'm also diversified enough that I would be fine, but if gives up 80-90% again during a long bear run again, I will buy back everything I sold this round and then some and there are many like me.

I've never understood how a diversified profile does not have 3-5% room for riskier homerun plays. I understand how most people lack sufficient diversification and they are probably the wrong audience for high risk / high reward opportunities, but to outright dismiss something without investigating it is just as foolish. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:35:15
This makes sense. It will be interesting to see how much mining power the original chain maintains as transition fees rise dramatically following the fork (encouraging miners to resume mining it). So long as it maintains 20-30% it will easily survive the initial split and ultimately the more profitable chain will win.

Jesus Christ, we have at most a couple million users after 6 years of development, massive news cycles, and nearly 1 billion in VC funding. Without user adoption volatility will stay through the roof and infrastructure investment will stop. 
You think merchants will keep talking bitcoin if no one ever uses it? You think the companies that remove merchant exchange risk (like Bitpay) will stay around without revenues? 
We need more users and we need them now. You want privacy? Buy coins OTC or mine them.

That's not what he is saying. He is saying that at present we have sufficient decentralization, in fact we have more than we need specifically as it applies to resist regulatory pressure.

Something that people always miss, for total market value (more significant than userbase size) its not just percentage of the world that holds ANY crypto, is also what percentage of those individual's assets are in crypto.
That number tends to go up over time as well, and can add at least another order of magnitude to market  growth. For example, 8% of Americans might currently have on average 0.5% of their assets in crypto, and might ultimately have 5-10% of their assets in crypto.

@_date: 2017-05-15 02:32:15
It will buy us years. Ethereum pumps out as much value right now mining Bitcoin does and there's no Asic for it after 2 years. 
In the meantime we can fix a lot of things if we have to go this route. 
But what's really going to happen is the price will start going down eventually just because of the cycle and then people will probably work harder to fix shit. Right now with the price rising and fees Rising even more there's literally no chance that anyone's going to compromise if they're making money off of that
@_date: 2011-07-01 21:47:40
I agree with you. I've done the math and until WebCL is widely supported, the numbers just aren't there. Even with Java based mining, you are still looking at sub 1 mh mining and with some browsers you are also getting a user prompt to start the applet. Of course it will be quite a while until WebCL is widely supported.

Who said its delayed by a year.  My thinking is this is how we get Segwit BEFORE August 1st.  If they couldn't get 95% agreement then this is the only way. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:18:07
No, my point is we should recognize their profit motive and use our understanding of it to realize why they wouldn't signal for something that a large number of them believed  (even if incorrectly in the longer term) would negatively affect them. 
95% miner signalling won't happen without something else. Maybe that something else is UASF. Maybe its a compromise focused on what happens after Segwit is enabled. But in the meanwhile we just wasted a ton of time and development effort. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:05:44
I'm talking about a long term core proposal
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:46:04

@_date: 2017-05-15 04:24:39
If it doesn't secure at least 10% of the total hash rate it really doesn't matter. Transactions will process very slowly on that side of the split and a futures market will quickly determine if the risk-adjusted rate of return on those coins on that chain will incentivizes those miners to continue or if more will drop off and the chain will stop. 
It can certainly be abandoned and likely will if it doesn't hit some minimum level of mining support. 
6% of nodes signaling (and many of those not having logic to follow the correct chain yet) won't do anything if some critical mass of mining isn't there.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:14:53

I couldn't believe how poorly wallets were handling fee estimations until the "stuck transaction" fiasco during February. The amount of wasted money, and later horrible usability because of those poor implementations absolutely blew my mind and changed my opinion on the blocksize issues in the short term. 
I still don't want high fees to use Bitcoin, but I definitely want wallets to do their jobs correctly and if after 7 years they still aren't then its because they lacked the required incentive. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:48:17


If fees can go from $0.05 to $1.50 then they can go to $20 pretty easily. It will soon be very possible to run a full node on $20 worth of hardware.

I don't think shapeshift will be out of business because Atomic swapping still requires negotiation and discovery
@_date: 2017-05-05 21:31:40
No it doesn't. There is a solution in place that has dev consensus and the network has already upgraded to it. We can either activate that solution or wait at least another year. Those are the only options. A hard fork is certainly more than a year out. Testing and upgrade for another soft fork (like extension blocks) would take at least a year. 
We can activate Segwit or we can wait. A political solution doesn't change technical realities. 
Edit:  I stated a fact. This isn't We don't downvote facts here because it upsets our fee fees.

UASF means the split is going to be temporary. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:53:56
6 years of holding my friend. i believe in it very much but simply being resistant to change alone isnt enough. Bitcoin is a technology after all. Just being resistant to change does not mean it is decentralized, it may just mean that it is controlled by equally powerful factions, and that some of the design choices being made to push it towards decentralization simply arent enough. 
Edit: and before anybody says other coins are even less decentralized let me say right now that their development might be but their mining certainly isn't and perhaps that matters with proof of work.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:40:02

You think all the people that signed on are just trying to undermine 148?
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:25:31
This is true but its a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
Also Ethereum forks differently because of fast difficulty retargeting. It is unclear if a 10% fork in Bitcoin could survive without also forking down difficulty. If Bitcoin had fast difficulty retargeting then a minority mining chain would have a much higher chance in a UASF scenario.  
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:06:20
Agreed 100%
If this is done slow and deliberately it will will have the best chance of success and limited disruption. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:45:13
You could have gotten on that plane with Adam, Luke, and Matt and done the hard work towards finding a solution with buy in from stakeholders. You could have then championed that solution as the best way forward. 
But you didn't. 
You told them not to go and you didn't participate. 
Now here we are with fees nearly $2, all use cases below $50 effectively killed, and the EARLIEST we will get a change is months away (and by using UASF at high levels of risk you've also said are unacceptable). 
Where is the proposal you claimed that Luke released months ahead of Segwit? Surely its not the one from early 2015 and I want to see it. 
Edit:  Everyone is frustrated. But unlike you (who refuses to acknowledge the leadership role that the users have given to you), we have a lot less ability to change anything. 
Wanna pretend that isn't true?  I think you're scared to find out.

Write a BIP for a 1MB witness size increase hard fork that activates late 2018 or mid 2019 and has additional safety controls that you feel are necessary (add anything that is needed). Tell the miners that if they activate Segwit you will work hard to gain support for it, but only if Segwit is activated in its current period.  The Bitcoin network can handle this now and it definitely can 18-24 months down the road. If that makes squeamish then make it 2020,  just do something to help them see a future. 
Give them a carrot and not just a stick. If you force them to dig in at this point then this is going to get really nasty. 
Edit: full disclosure, unlike most of I actually own Bitcoins and believe this action would greatly benefit me personally.

There are two outcomes, Bitcoin can split or it can stay together. 87% of the miners supposedly support Segwit according to Bitfury and Barry Sillbert. If that's true then we need to work to get it activated or we need to support this to pressure to get it activated because there is not one person holding Bitcoins that thinks their holdings will be more valuable if it splits. 
War will not be good, it's time to come together. The only way out at this point is to make the threat of UASF so large that Segwit activates. Every other alternative is much worse future.

Good, then we can stop talking about it. Bitcoin is up like 700% over the last three years and 20% just this week.

Bitcoin can drop under 50% of the entire combined market share and we can maybe stop talking about it.

It's important to get your coins off the exchange but you can definitely wait until you have a lot more than that (at least hundreds of dollars)  and then do a single transfer. 
You can also time that transfer for when fees are lower over the weekend.

I also favor BIP 149. Personally I would like an option for it in the reference client ASAP and a general sense among the devs that UASF are safe with enough lead time.

First off 51% eventually, not 100%. Secondly there are already exchanges and wallets supporting BIP148 (and that number will grow after miners fuck up the NY agreement, which they will), thirdly the UASF chain doesn't get overwritten (ever),  it could only be abandoned, and it very likely won't be because it's coins will be more valuable. 
Hopefully Segwit activates before all this, because we are not going to stall for another six months or a year to get an upgrade in place

Thank you so much, this will really benefit a lot of people who have used or continue to use paper wallets and would like to spend from them using their hardware wallets. Reading the QR code and sweeping into a HW address as a single function would solve all of the "change address" issues that people have had (with paper wallets) because the HW wallet address is created using the HD seed. 
I realize this is more of an advanced feature for a specific user type, but a lot of people have requested this and when I mentioned it on reddit it was upvoted. In my case, I just want to keep some of my funds separated in individual addresses and not risk entering a seed into a possibly compromised device unless something catastrophic has happened. I understand that may seem paranoid but there are lots of people who share this view and giving these people an easy way to spend their funds will increase the demand for HW wallets.

Oh, I didn't realize that is NECESSARY consequence of the 2MB maximum blocksize blocks that Gavin had been pushing for the last 6 months. Maybe he just was concerned about full blocks and the negative effects to adoption that could happen as transaction fees rise.

it doesnt matter if they do. if segwit is not activated by august 1st then uasf will activate it and they (ny agreement supporters) lose all leverage. if segwit is activated prior to august first (using this HF client) then even a "locked in" hardfork wont happen eventually in 6 months if it doesnt still/ever have enough consensus at that time.

What are you talking about? You don't have to move the stuff off the exchange every time you buy. 
If you moved it once a month it would be $12 a year. If you moved it six times a year it would be $6. If you're buying so much that you need to move it constantly then you don't care about the fee and if you're buying so little that a dollar matters you can leave it on the exchange until you have more, it's going to be okay
The idea high fees are preventing dollar cost averaging as silly. I know we make a big deal about getting a coins off the exchange but that's probably when they're in the at least hundreds but more likely thousands range.

Then the fork will not gain consensus and will fail but in the meantime we will make progress and I'm willing to commit to try in good faith.

Clients that orphan non signaling blocks are attempting to alter the Bitcoin protocol, which currently allows for non signaling blocks.
Segwit has overwhelming support. A client enforcing BIP 148 currently does not. 
If BIP 148 fails it will  A) cost the miners who supported it money and B) embolden all the rest of the miners against UASF in principal.  If we are going to UASF we need to get massive support and a good chance that its going to work.
Next July is a long time away but BIP 149 looks good even there is wasted development effort. 
I don't know if you think BIP 148 is actually going to work or if you think just the threat of it will be enough to move the miners towards Segwit. But for this to be serious we are going to need some number of exchanges publicly supporting it and right now that number is 0 AFAIK. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:40:28

I don't even think it's that crazy of a risk scenario to be honest. A counterfeit hardware wallet (that you are using as a replacement if the original died) that gets your seed just got all of your money. 
And the problem is how could you verify that you don't have a counterfeit hardware wallet? You can't. You are completely fucked in this situation. Even if there is a complicated method to verify, once everyone is using hardware wallets, the incentive to try to steal from users relying on them goes up, and so will the sophistication of the schemes
I don't have to worry about any that shit.

Bitcoin was figuratively premined ,which is why a very large percentage is owned by Satoshi and has never moved. 
Regarding central administered, we used to have a benevolent dictator too.
In terms of irresponsibly maintained I can't argue with you, the DAO fork is an embarrassment, but that doesn't mean that the remaining parameters arent actually in place to make it a better solution overall.

1)  One of the miners signaled for classic instead of core, which used as cover to let people out of the agreement. 
2) "delivered" his promised hard fork. It reduced the blocksize to 300kb and kept it under the current 1MB limit until 2024. This, obviously, is not what anyone in Hong Kong believed they were agreeing to.

@_date: 2016-05-05 17:11:38
So then you think that Gavin, if he is this malicious, is also that dumb? 
Because that's fucking stupid as hell. Which then means either
1) Gavin is malicious, dishonest, and incredibly stupid because is its highly unlikely (otherwise) that he would believe this scheme would work. 
2) Wright successfully tricked Gavin but then wasn't able to fool everyone. 
Over the 5 years that I've been paying attention, the only time I've personally felt that Gavin was being somewhat dishonest was when he gave a "small chance" to the death spiral at halvening theory on twitter. I'm pretty sure he didn't really think that was realistic. I'm sure the other devs can remember other examples over the years, but I also can personally remember times where other devs have been flat out intellectually dishonest. We are all people and sometimes we let emotions cloud our reasoning. Most of these are borderline examples though where people aren't making concrete statements that can be refuted and none of them are on the level of trying to pull massive hoaxes. 
But what you are suggesting is Gavin is both very malicious AND very stupid and I'm having a hard time accepting that is the likely cause.

You fundamentally misunderstand Bitcoin. If miners were able to set protocol rules then they could create more coins. The reason they can't create more coins is because my nodes will reject them, no matter how much hash rate they have. 
So as you can clearly see in that example, my nodes are protecting me from a hostile mining attack attempting to change the protocol.
Of course the nodes run by exchanges matter even more than mine (for obvious reasons) but even in that case nodes are still protecting against a hostile mining attack.

I used to really like Gavin. He was one of the first people I saw speaking on Bitcoin's behalf. He seemed like he was a good representative. 
Then he wrote some blog posts with some data that had errors. I chalked it up as a simple mistake
Then he tweeted nonsense about the mining "death spiral" at the halving, which anyone with a half of second of thought would realize wouldn't happen. I literally wrote 14 point rebuttals on why it was ridiculous. 
Then the Craig Wright incident happened. 
That was a disaster.
Now this shit. And honestly, this shit is the worst. If everyone takes Gavin's attitude then Bitcoin dies. Tragedy of the commons.

I don't think it makes sense to speculate on what the landscape could look like by July 2018. For BIP149 to matter it means both the NY agreement and BIP148 have failed. If BIP148 has failed its unknown whether it will have been completely abandoned at that point or if Bitcoin has effectively split. In either case there has likely been some major disruption and who knows what other developments between now and then. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:25:17
If that was actually true then BIP101 is completely a shittastic way to do that because it basically guaranteed that at least 90% of users could run full nodes at home for a minimum of the next 2 decades  AND also because datacenters can be located all over the Earth and thus be under no single government's direct purview. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:27:59
I'm in the same boat. I sincerely hope you are looking at that COOP proposal Jeff because it would help get a larger base of support (and it just makes technical sense).
Ultimately I don't have a problem supporting the NY agreement. If it fails, I'm using all my resources to make sure BIP148 succeeds, and if that fails I'm likely done with Bitcoin (which I have been very actively involved with since 2011) because stagnation is unacceptable at this point. Its frankly painful watching Bitcoin continue to pretend like its the only game in town.

You think they had a clear motive and thought they could convince everyone without the simplest of evidence? Because its either that or deception. 
Right now I think the most likely two choices are  
1) Satoshi was a group, the other members are dead, and Wright was involved.
2) Wright gained access to Gavin's earlier communications with Satoshi (maybe by targeting and hacking Gavin) and was able to fool him. 
Wright has spent a tremendous amount of time trying to fabricate evidence that he is Satoshi when none of that should be required even if he no longer has access to the original coins. He just destroyed Gavin's reputation without performing the same basic verification publicly that he supposedly already was able to. Would the real Satoshi do this to the guy who most helped him with his early vision? 
The simplest answer is Wright is a fraud and has used his resources as part of a hoax.

@_date: 2016-05-28 22:13:10
thats exactly the point.  If i sweep a paper wallet in im only risking the balance in that single address address whereas if I use the original seed and the computer I'm using has malware then I lose everything. I've had people say "then use multiple seeds" but thats overly complicated and still increases my risk to all associated addresses from one of those seeds.
 I specifically want to seperate the funds (by address) and reduce my risk when spending from one, while still having a single seed (for backup) to get to all addresses if something bad happens.  
What I really want is to be able to sweep paper wallets into hardware wallet addresses directly, instead of having to make extra hops with mobile wallets, and the extra risk there.  told me this is coming at some point I believe
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:48:22
Normally I can't stand tinfoil conspiracy bullshit in any form but things are not right here and it feels like some kind of attack. 
There are a lot of theories. I think that its possible that Satoshi was a group and that Craig was an early/founding member. I think this may also explain his limited ability to prove that he is Satoshi, or control most of the coins, and which is why there is this big ass charade and no simple verification or desire to answer a few basic questions. 
I think that Craig probably did talk with Gavin originally as Satoshi and that's why he was able to convince Gavin so easily because they have shared knowledge from those original conversations. 
Whatever the case that since Craig and Gavin want us to think Craig is "the" Satoshi then the question is why?
And for that to be understood I think we have to wait and see what happens next.

If it hardforks difficulty down it changes the whole game theory because then the chain no longer causes a reorg if it gets the majority at a future point. 
Might as well just hardfork segwit right now. 
You know what you could do Luke? You could go come up with a conservative BIP100 + Segwit (with reduced witness discount) hard fork option somewhat similar to what people thought they were getting an agreement for and you could lobby for it and see how much support it has. Make the maximum size the same as worst case SW (4 MB)
 If it looks like we're getting a hard fork anyway then why don't we just get the one that everybody thought we were getting at the Hong Kong agreement
Did you technically fulfill what you said you were going to do? Sure, but I'm also positive I'm not the only person who looked at the potential hard fork you delivered and said "oh come on". 
You didn't fulfill the spirit of the agreement that you made made even if you fulfilled some interpretation of it. If Bitcoin ends up splitting thrn maybe that was inevitable but at the same time maybe it wasn't if people actually really tried to seek the best unified solution.

Technology is measured in users, use cases, marketshare, ecosystem, etc. These same metrics can be applied to bitcoin. 
When you say Bitcoin has no intrinsic value I might as well say Facebook has no intrinsic value. They both have users that invest their time (and / or money). They both have an industry and ecosystem based around them. They have direct and indirect competitors.

I got in a huge argument with somebody who thought the best way to protect money for some guy going to prison was to try to remember an electrum seed for his whole prison term.
 I will always support paper wallets, even with their flaws. Luke Dash Jr has stated that you are guaranteed to lose all your money eventually with paper wallets. I don't think that's true but I do know I'm guaranteed to lose all of my money with my memory
Edit: I do think HD seeds are great and wish core would incorporate them. I think Hardware wallets are they best way to spend Bitcoins and I wish there was more support for sweeping paper wallets into them. 
If somebody could make paper wallets that are generated by an HD seed, I think that would really be the best solution
I mostly agree with this article - 
For new users I would definitely recommend a hardware wallet. For people that have substantial money in Bitcoin it's still hard for me to trust a single vendor no matter what checks are in place. I can personally audit the code that generates paper wallets, I have no ability to audit a hardware wallet. That's just me and my extreme level of paranoia. For my mom I would go with a hardware wallet. Any of my friends that buy their first $100 of Bitcoin I tell them to go get a ledger nano

then the assets were in stocks where they had market risk.   maybe you like your existing stock allocation and don't want to add to or subtract from it. maybe capital gains timing comes into play.

Having liquid cash as a percentage of holdings is not absurd. That's literally how you buy assets when they go on sale. If you think the stock market is very overdue for a correction then having cash is not a bad idea. 
Everything else you mentioned is less liquid and / or carries risk. Cash only has inflation and opportunity cost risks. Its literally the lowest risk thing you can have. 
Everyone's holdings should reflect their goals. If OP knew they weren't going to touch the capital for a year then of course there are better options, but thats information you don't actually have.

My question is regarding trading for other goods. Do I always have to track against USD on the day the coin is purchased and then the USD value when the coin is traded for the other good?
 Since I'm always buying and spending (and donating, and giving away to friends, etc) coins, that seems pretty difficult to effectively track. I mean, I use Bitcoin every single day. Its one thing to calculate gains when a coin is sold for USD and has a capital realization event, its much harder when you are using them as a purchasing mechanism and making transactions daily. 
On that note, I also have no idea how to handle trading on an exchange. Would you have to track every coin and every trade, or just when you are "paid" by withdrawing USD. I definitively am going to stay compliant and I'm concerned that tracking all of this is going to be extremely time consuming. I already spend thousands per year on an accountant to handle my business taxes, the burden is becoming excessive.

What we need is a resource that reports how much of this is going on, with an optional parameter for what % of transaction we think is rational  (e.g. someone will not pay 90% of a transaction as a fee).

I'm confused. Aren't Authy tokens encrypted and unrecoverable by Authy? Wouldn't that require the additional password for this exploit?
edit: from 
Restoring Authy Keys:
If you have a new phone — or are adding a new device — you can restore your Authy keys by following these steps:
First install Authy on your new device.

Do you know what altruism is? I don't think you do. 
I want my transaction to be included. Paying a fee MAKES IT MORE LIKELY that it will be. Nothing (even a large fee) guarantees that it will be. If I'm a bad actor and my transactions are associated with me, then large miners can specifically leave out my transactions regardless of fee. 
None of my actions are done for the good of the network or selflessly. They are done to encourage processing of my transaction.

Your visa card incurs a transaction fee of around 3% to the merchant selling you something, which means the thing you are buying costs 3% more to you than it should, and could be discounted to you by much more than your cash back reward if you instead paid in bitcions. Your desire for reversibility of all transactions means that you are also paying for escrow on all of your transactions, even when they aren't necessary (like when you buy a cup of coffee). In fact, your ability to chargeback easily means again the merchant has to bill in a rate to cover frivolous chargebacks into your fee when they otherwise wouldn't be necessary, continuing to raise the price you are paying. It also means that there are certain goods that you generally cannot buy with a credit card because of this chargeback risk to the merchant. A bar of gold for example. Or a bitcoin. 
On to your second point, your funds are not less secure than sitting in a bank account, because with a bank account you don't actually control them. Ask the people in Cyprus what that is really like. Or ask anyone who has ever had funds frozen or taken from their paypal account for no good reason. Then there is identify theft. And guess what, that also costs money that you ultimately are paying for one way or another. 
Yes, we are a ways from Bitcoin being user friendly. It has been around for 5 years. Email was around for 30 before it became easy enough for most people to use it (and then probably still not your grandma).

Amazon's fee margins are obviously higher than the lower end of this scale since that is what they pay their affiliates. They charge up to 15% depending on product category, and they are the ultimate "volume" company.

As I've said, and you've just demonstrated, the linear chart makes it look like there was no growth for a long period of time because of the distortion caused by the later expotential growth and that problem is greatly exasberated if you go for further back.

The cost to store things gets cheaper over time. It doesn't have to (and can't) remain free forever. What we need to do is to get growing transaction fees to make up for decreasing block subsidy. 
There are two ways you can do this 
1) Increase the cost of an individual transaction
2) Increase the number of transactions
A Bitcoin that focuses on 2) is more ubiquitous and useful, and subsequently is likely to be much more valuable, as Gavin mentions in his post. The concern is that at high (and growing) numbers of transactions, it becomes more expensive to participate in the network as a full node and decentralization decreases. Unfortunately, focusing on 1) means that a high (and growing) number of transactions happen off of the blockchain (since it is more expensive to use the blockchain directly), and decentralization still decreases since users are pushed towards 3rd party providers. So, there needs to be a balance and hopefully a rough consensus amongst Bitcoin participants
Now the question of how to maximize total transaction income is an interesting one from an economic viewpoint. To use an analogy, if you sell apples and can grow lots of them, you will make a lot more money selling hundreds of apples for $1 each than selling 5 apples for $10 each. In the same vein, more fee income can be generated in volume, instead of with high individual costs.

@_date: 2013-10-21 16:44:51
BUT even with effectively NO scarcity, transaction fees are around 1% of block subsidy and rising. It is reasonable to believe that they will continue to rise as greater numbers of transactions are included (especially since some of those will continue to have a nominal fee to encourage processing). 
We do know that relatively high transaction costs are not in Bitcoin's favor because they will decrease use and as a money, Bitcoin's value is derived from its use.

A really touching story from a great man. I'm very thankful for his contribution to Bitcoin and that his story raises awareness for ALS. For those of you that aren't familiar with the disease, there has been very little process made in treatments for it in the 80 years since Lou Gerhig made it famous.

your point was literally about saving money, at the cost of convenience,  not about what is more secure. 
The attack vector you are describing is real, but I would be more likely to get hit by a truck tomorrow while driving then have that specific attack carried out.  In either case (postal interception and replacement or firmware based state sponsored backdoor) there are much easier ways for the government to steal someone's money. 
I understand not wanting to trust all of your crypto assets with a single hw manufacturer but for 99% of people  (even most technical people), its the best move because the risk of fucking up on their own is higher.

One thing I expect to happen is that groups with large incentives to protect Bitcoin will begin to offer up incentives for others run full nodes. You will literally be paid not just for mining, but for dedicating the storage and network resources that are required to secure the network against things like Sybil attacks. 
On the flip side, most people (and their devices such as phones, watches, home security, whatever) will not run full nodes, and subsequently Bitcoin will become even more accessible for them.

First off, saying "deflation is bad" is the same thing as saying "inflation is bad". If the amount is small and predictable, it has little effect on the economy. If you need proof of that, observe that people still buy electronics that are consistently deflating in value against their currency. 
Secondly, the biggest problem with deflation in a traditional economy is that it restricts the money supply. This is not a problem for a digital currency because it is effectively infinitely divisible. 
Finakly , we now have a lot of data from this grand experiment called Bitcoin. The payment processors tell us that spending of bitcoins goes up when the price is rising. This contradicts the assumption that the coins would be more hoarded. And that is because regardless of the future value of a money, people still have, and always will have, immediate needs

If that is the case, are mined bitcoins treated differently than purchased bitcoins since they would not get capital asset treatment? 
2. If I give away bitcoins, is there still a realization event (that I have to pay) or does the receiving party just pay an income tax if it exceeds their annual gift allowance?

there are more kinds of scarcity than just material goods. Saying that there always be scarcity is akin to saying there will always be gravity. Its a consequence of the universe we live in. We can limit scarcity just like we can limit the measured effects of gravity (in specific contexts), but it still will exist.

Its a little bit different because apple generates profits, which vary based on product margins. apple could generate more money next year and still have its stock price decline.

What do you value a Bitcoin at?  Longer term I value one at much more than an ounce of gold (at a minimum).  There will never be enough Bitcoins for every American to have even 1/15 of one (ever), let alone everyone (or every company) in the world. Think about what that means if they are useful to society. 
My attitude is that you are buying what is essentially preferred stock that is going to split many, many times. That said, this is high risk and highly volatile. Its a surprise it has risen from $3 to $29 with as little volatility as it has. Do not invest money that you cannot lose. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:51:49

Lets math it out using two comparable options for a year,  a bank savings account and a CD.  Both extremely low risk. One more liquid than the other. 
Looking at bankrate.com for current rates on savings accounts you can get 1.15% from Synchrony Bank (near the top).  At the FDIC limit of $250,000 for that year then you would earn $2875 in interest for the year. You would be able to take out your money at any point.
Now looking at bankrate.com for current rates on CDs Synchrony also  offers one near the top rate at 1.40%. In the same scenario you would earn $3500 in interest over the same period but you would pay a penalty (potentially all of the interest) if you moved the money early. 
So for the ability to move the money wherever you want without penalty you would earn $625 less over the year.
Now, of course there are better returns on the cash for a year, but they all have risks and are less liquid then either of these options. If you don't have a balanced portfoilo already then it makes sense to create one, and if you don't have 6 months of living expenses in cash (also known as an "oh shit fund") those would be the very first things you do with the money after paying down high interest debt. But thats basic personal finance.
The bottom line is when you get large assets you can quickly hit an FDIC limit with only a small portion of your portfolio. And then yeah, you can open more accounts and rebalance stuff, but its not really that insane to have cash in the bank if you are doing everything right.  If you had $10,000,000 in assets then $250,000 would only be 2.5% of your portfolio, and if you had that much money you'd probably want some percentage just for new opportunities.

1. Its not always a trusted party
2. I have. Many times. 
3. But it is for some. I'd rather not have a sex toys shop on my credit card bill. 
4. There is a discount because the seller has to pay procesing fees. Fees which are lower when using bitcoin. The cost you pay is a combination of all fees the seller encounters. 
5. Fair enough. 
6. You missed my point completely. I can't get USD into an online poker site. I can with Bitcoin
7. And we aren't the only ones who do this. 
8. And have fees. And not everyone wants to accept them. 
I do spend my ever deflating BTC because there are situations where its advantageous to do it. I also have the ability to replenish my 'btc hoard' whenever I want if I'm trying to keep it as an investment. There are many other examples of when BTC is the only method I can use. Maybe I want to support an open source developer in Iran. Maybe I want to buy an item in a country that Paypal doesn't cover. There are lots of times when USD isn't an option. Just because you can't think of any, or that none currently apply to you, does not mean that Bitcoin does not have a use as money or the PREFERABLE payment method depending on the transaction.

My question is that with expensive transactions, who won't be able to use Bitcoin at all? People concerned with the validity of the Bitcoin network can always run a full node, or even pool with others to do so. My concern is with the guy in Africa who doesn't even have a computer. I want Bitcoin to be available to him, and with expensive transactions it never will be. Increasing transactions costs increases centralization, it does not decrease it.

if the winklevii own 1% of all bitcoins as off the begining of this year, they own roughly 100k bitcoins and there are MAYBE 2-3 other invididuals with as many (satoshi would be one).
if a bitcoin grows another 3 orders of magnitude in value (to $200,000 each) the winklevii own about $20 billion worth of bitcoin. In other words, about 1/4 of what Bill Gates is currently worth.

You are working to solve a hard problem and while my experience with you has not always been perfect (e.g. random down time, double purchase error, etc), you are overall doing a fantastic job and your rates are pretty reasonable. I recommend your service first for friends that are new to bitcoin and who are trying to get their own coins. 
I've been buying bitcoins for almost 2 years and I now buy my coins almost exclusively from your service. Please keep up the good work.

My "compete out of my ass guess" is that those people also typically are holding enough bitcoin at this point to be able to work on it full time. 
Consider that a year ago, 1000 coins cost $12000 and today it is worth $1.2 million. If you are a core bitcoin developer, you have probably been in the game for more than 1 year and probably acquired some coins along the way.

Maybe, but run the numbers adjusting for mining block reward %, transaction fee growth, and some wild guesses about hardware sale potential. I have and in most bad scenarios the stock is still returning minimum 25% annual. So perhaps its still very under priced.

I can run a full node on a $35 rpi while paying $2 to actually use the system. Previously I did all of this on a $2000 laptop. 
We have optimized enough towards minimal hardware constraints and it makes sense to focus now on usability until running nodes becomes expensive / difficult again.

If you look at the result of every single major bubble, we have a long sell off period afterward. On the order of 3-6 months. Even still, the April bubble was interesting because most people predicted it would bottom at $30-$40, but it actually barely got under $60 and only for a short time. Mostly staying at 3-4x what the bubble started at. So people trying to time it did get burned. Holding is definitely the best move.  The same thing now would keep it around 350-600 for awhile.
I agree with you, $2000 or more within a year. Probably a lot more.

when it popped in 2011 it was up from a nickle at the start of the bubble to about $3 at the absolute bottom of the crash. This bubble started around $15-$20, and I'm guessing $30-$40 is the absolute floor. 
I should also mention that prices were pretty stable (relatively for bitcoin) for almost a year between these cycles. 
If it takes a bubble to get exposure, and a crash to reduce volatility, then we will just keep growing in cycles.

I don't think having 200k into BTC if your net worth is $2 million is especially silly. If it dies, you still have $1.8 million. If it goes up 10x again, you have doubled your net worth to $4 million and you can probably retire. I think it really comes down to not investing money you can't lose. What that means is different to everyone.

Peter's long term goal is building off chain transaction services. Those services are more attractive if using Bitcoin directly is more expensive. Peter has gone on record saying that a per transaction fee of $5-$15 is acceptable, despite the fact that the storage and bandwidth costs to provide for that transaction are in the fractions of a cent (and dropping). He does not want Bitcoin to grow as a payment network, he does not want you using it for your morning coffee, or as a currency period.

I am not a lawyer but I found this interesting
Exceptions - Certain MSBs are not required to register:
Solely an agent. - A person that is an MSB solely because that person serves as an agent of another MSB is not required to register. However, a person that is an MSB both because it engages in MSB activities on its own behalf and as an agent of another MSB, must register.
Stored value. - A person that is an MSB solely as an issuer, seller, or redeemer of stored value is not required to register. However, a person that is an MSB as an issuer, seller, or redeemer of stored value and engages in MSB activities (of a nature and value that cause the person to be an MSB on a basis other than stored value) must register.
Stored value - Funds or monetary value represented in digital electronics format (whether or not specially encrypted) and stored or capable of storage on electronic media in such a way as to be retrievable and transferable electronically.
Money Services Business - The term "money services business" includes any person doing business, whether or not on a regular basis or as an organized business concern, in one or more of the following capacities:
(1) Currency dealer or exchanger. 
(2) Check casher. 
(3) Issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value. 
(4) Seller or redeemer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value. 
(5) Money transmitter.
(6) U.S. Postal Service.
An activity threshold of greater than $1,000 per person per day in one or more transactions applies to the definitions of: currency dealer or exchanger; check casher; issuer of traveler's checks, money orders or stored value; and seller or redeemer of travelers' checks, money orders or stored value. The threshold applies separately to each activity -- if the threshold is not met for the specific activity, the person engaged in that activity is not an MSB on the basis of that activity.
No activity threshold applies to the definition of money transmitter. Thus, a person who engages as a business in the transfer of funds is an MSB as a money transmitter, regardless of the amount of money transmission activity.
So, my interpretation is that if you do not engage as a business in the transfer of funds you are not a money transmitter and if you do not exchange more than $1000 per day than you are not a MSB. 
After reading all of this, my interpretation is that the stored value exception is the only way that someone selling any amount of BTC for cash is not a money transmitter. But then this seems to imply that selling any BTC for cash makes you a money transmitter -
------------------------------------------------------- 
 In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.
note that the word business is intentionally not used and "person" is repeatedly stated. They know what they are doing.

I don't understand why you think the y axis scaled as e^ln(BTC/USD) is a problem. I can find instanteous BTC/USD at any time period and by scaling the Y-axis, I can visualize the entire 4 year history of the growth in value of BTC which you CANNOT do on a linear scale for any time period greater than one year.

That depends. Some questions I need to answer first
 
1. Would I benefit from being able to prove payment using the blockchain? For example, in the case of a preorder of a product?
2. Would I benefit from being to prove payment by signing my payment address?
3. Do I need or prefer anonymity and is the transaction not local?
4. Will you give me a discount since your transaction fees will be lower than any using other method and since you have 0 chargeback risk?
5. Given the deflationary nature of Bitcoin, will you discounting the product relative to USD as many vendors are?
6. Is this a good or service that is difficult for me to buy using USD, even if you accept it? Examples would be things like online poker, illegal substances, or grey market items.
7. Do I want to reward you for accepting bitcoin, which ultimately increases the value of all bitcoins everywhere?
8. If the purchase is local and expensive, would I prefer to not carry a lot of cash?
There are lots of reasons and needs to use BTC over USD. It all comes down to the situation.

@_date: 2013-12-13 09:12:58
Thats a valid point (the rapid rise and fear of risk), but at this point we do not have current evidence that hoarding increases the more that the currency deflates and that has always been the assumption.
Regardless, we've never had a currency like this. It is not based on debt and does not have divisibility issues. Its current supply is known and its future supply is predictable.  Before you spout off that this thing would destroy the world's economy if it was more widely used, realize that there has never been money like this before and we honestly don't know what would (will) happen.

I've made some dumb moves this year, driven by greed, that have cost me a substantial amount of money. 
You made $350,000 in a very short period of time, don't play the what could have happened game. 
And buy a few bitcoins now, so you can enjoy any additional increase without that massive regret. 
edit: what I've learned is that now I have a written down plan that I follow. The best time to make that plan is during a stable period, the second best time is right now if you don't have one. As long as you have a plan and execute you won't regret anything. You made the best decisions you could with the information you had and didn't let things sway you. 
For me, I will always hold some bitcoin, regardless of value, but I will also continue limiting it to a comfortable (or just only slightly uncomfortable) percentage of my net worth. I won't win as big perhaps, but I can fucking sleep now.

Until the dividends go down, the stock is cheap. Period. If AM can continue to deploy hardware cheaper than everyone else can buy it, they can maintain their network percentage. As long as transaction fees rise, there is growth potential in mining. 
Hardware sales are only getting started. Have you been paying attention to the BFL shipping blog? They are fucking incompetent over there. There is exactly one company that can actually ship on schedule and it continues to be AM.

It is about speculation but you are flat out wrong. If you think litecoins are going to increase in the future, then you should be mining bitcoins and trading for litecoins each day. You will get MORE LITECOINS this way since bitcoin mining is more profitable in terms of generating litecoins then mining litecoins is (and since all litecoin mining devices can also mine bitcoins). Read that last sentence again, if you understand it you will understand why people should not be mining litecoins right now, regardless of if they think litecoins will go up in the future.
The fact that litecoin difficulty continues to rise, while they are less profitable TO MINE than bitcoins, shows that people are idiots and do not understand what they are doing.

what are you asking? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:32:27
Ok fair enough. Here we go. 
How the fuck is this a sign that the whole shebang could crash? Were bitcoins just made illegal? If not bitcoins then how about US based exchanges and exchange services? Did coinbase get shut down too? What about CampBX? Is bitpay going under? Were bitcoin users arrested and taken from their homes? Is there new legislation pending that could cause some of these things to happen? Was a fundamental flaw in the blockchain or SHA256 found? Did the blockchain fork 100 ways? Did some crucial people just die mysteriously? 
Oh right, none of that just happened. Calm down. 
This is a highly speculative technological and economical experiment. Its the first of its kind to have meaningful success. If one account for one exchange being seized in one country for a still unknown reason (most likely because someone(s) was/were using it for an illegal purpose) is enough to make you worry that the ship is about to go down, then this probably too high risk for your liking. Because ultimately for Bitcoin to do what it needs to do, there are going to be a lot bigger bumps in the road than this. In other words, if you are scared about losing your investment right now, you've invested too much.

There can be a balance between the number of nodes and the usefulness of Bitcoin. IMO the idea of the majority of Bitcoin transfers using off chain transactions (and thus introducing counterparty risk) defeats the entire purpose of Bitcoin. Similarly I'm sure to the idea of most people not running full nodes does for you. 
The problem that I have with "blocksize absolutionists" is that computing advances and so then does the ability to run "bigger" full nodes.  A 10mb blocksize is currently not a problem for a 56k modem, thats how small the practical limit is right now.

@_date: 2013-04-11 20:30:23
I think the floor is a little higher than $30; I'd guess maybe $40-$50 because of the number of people who now know about and in some cases have bitcoins because of this cycle. The last bubble started at 5 cents and after popping got as low as about $3, so its definitely possible that this recent bubble has again "raised the floor". 
Either way, I'd be surprised to see things get down to $20 again, but if it happens then I'm loading the fuck up, and if not then I'm going back to dollar cost averaging. I believe in Bitcoin and I want it to occupy the risky part of my portfolio.

I don't want to use credit card companies at all. This has absolutely nothing to with fees other than that using Bitcoin has lower fees already than credit card companies and that is a benefit to both the merchant and the buyer. 
The biggest issue to using Bitcoin is that it is highly volatile and that decreases usage since nobody has an idea of what it will be worth relative to goods from day to day. If we can increase usage we can decrease volatility by making bitcoin's value more reflective of demand and less of speculation. Preventing merchants from being exposed to currency risk has dramatically increased adoption, and is the only reason that Reddit accepts payment using bitcoin. We need to figure out a way to give the same benefit to consumers.
If you have any ideas about how we can make this virtual currency more of an actual currency, I'm all ears.

Currently miners collectively earn about 40 BTC per day from transaction fees and 3600 from block rewards. The network has to grow 90x its current volume. That sounds like a lot, but certainly possible in 3-4 years, when the block reward halves again (in which case that number only needs to be 45x today's levels to equal the block reward and effectively earn rewards equivalent to today).
@_date: 2013-06-14 01:07:12
Yup and that is with effectively "unlimited" block size and still having free (but delayed) transactions. 
Which is why, if we can increase USAGE 25x-50x we won't even need ANY block rewards to secure the network. 
And that level of usage only requires 20-40mb blocks. Funding for security is not an issue.

I understand all of this but am willing to spend 1-2% on fees per transaction to 
A) allow me to spend bitcoins like i do fiat
B) prevent my lose of BTC exposure. 
I want to use bitcoin as a currency. I want to hold bitcoins. I want something that automates this, even if it costs me an additional small fee. And I know coinbase sure as fuck wants to increase the money they generate in fees. Its a win for everyone. 
Finally, for merchants that already discount my purchase when paying in bitcoins, the ultimate fees to me could still end up as nothing.

Except it doesn't. Keeping the blocksize limit encourages off chain transactions facilitated by centralized institutions. It makes transactions expensive, thus making bitcoin use inaccessible for individuals having lower means. 
Keeping the blocksize limit creates massive centralization. Then we are all using coinbase.com and not bitcoin.

The block size can increase by a factor of at least 40 before it really start to preclude the average person from running a full node, and that is TODAY. 
You can increase the blocksize by a factor of 10 and still run a full node off of a 56K DIAL UP MODEM FOR GOD SAKES. That's how ridiculous this discussion is.

Right now (as in between now and the next 6-8 weeks) I think the best two possible moves for people on a limited budget who want to get into mining are either to 
a) get in on a chip group buy 
b) to order a jalapeno. It is possible that BFL continues to increase their shipping rate and does get new orders out in time for them to be profitable eventually. Avalon has still not completed batch 2 (and a couple people from batch 1 are STILL waiting), so who knows how long the chips are actually going to take
Since you already have shares I would highly recommend that if you can help it DO NOT sell all of your asicminer pass throughs. So far, those guys are crushing it, and at least there you have no shipping delays or assembly risks, just very steady dividends. More importantly, your mining investment will have to be continually increased, whereas the shares are in a company that will increase their hashing rate (as difficulty increases) and will be best suited to do it competitively because they are also the manufacturer.

Yes but that's just on the mining front. ASICMiner has other opportunities. They could build other purposed ASIC devices and require payment in Bitcoin. USB based Password crackers for example. Actually, anything that requires hashing. Maybe Friedcat would self fund such an effort as a seperate entity and not take investment, who knows. The point is when you start going 2-3 years out, the picture is a lot less clear and part of investing in a company is betting on the management team.

The price was going to crater in the shorter term (2-6 months) because it always does following a bubble. Go look at charts for the last 3 bubbles.  The entire money stock of Bitcoin is currently under $7 billion, however 30-40% of those coins have never moved. Realistically the amount that could be bought was under a few hundred million.  
Forget about countries like China, there are INDIVIDUALS that have more money than that. Also companies. And hedge funds. 
China has both sped up the last bubble, and will probably speed up its deflation. But in the long run, this shit does not matter at all. I'm not saying that because herp derp circle jerk. I've been saying that the price was going back down for weeks. I'm saying that because I'm not new here and I know how this works now. 
@_date: 2013-10-14 16:56:57
Here is my advice to you. Make a plan right now for what you are going to do at what price. Write that shit down. Commit to yourself that you will not deviate from the plan.
If Bitcoins go way up or down, your emotions will start destroying your logic and reasoning. You won't know if you are being influenced by greed, fear, or both in the same day.
Make the plan now, execute it then. Failure to do so WILL cost you money.

Its not about maximizing gains so much as reducing loses in the short term. You have to understand that normally when new people hear about Bitcoin, its during a bubble. By cost averaging in, they get some exposure while protecting against going in big at the top of the bubble.

I love Bitcoin, and I'm investing in it, but the most dangerous fucking words when investing are "this time its different" no matter what the investment is. 
We aren't getting to $1000, if we get to $1000, without some major corrections along the way. Its a question of when, not if. Also if there eventually is a flaw discovered, if the system cannot scale, if there is a problem that nobody saw coming, you better believe the value will crash faster than it has risen. 
Its good to be optimistic, but its bad to be blind and foolish.

I think you are misunderstanding me. I am saying that for a paper currency, remittance transactions make up an extremely small percentage of total transactions, so a high cost for those specific transactions isn't an issue.  Whereas it would be for all transactions (in bitcoin) to have a similar cost as remittance transactions in dollars. 
I wasn't saying that remittance is a single digit percentage of bitcoin transactions today. To be sure, you are absolutely correct that we have no idea what most of the transactions on the blockchain are actually for.

I can buy the storage for maxed out 100MB blocks right now (representing 200x present day transaction growth) for about $0.50 per day, today (and getting cheaper). That represents maybe 1/3 the price of a typical computer. That's 200 times today's usage. That could allow a 1-2 billion dollar economy to become a 10 or even 100 billion dollar economy.

I understand that could be extreme optimism, and that there is a great likelyhood that it is. However, a monetary base (for an economy) is different than a market cap. When we talk about monetary bases, we talk in trillions, not billions. I am investing in Bitcoin, knowing its extremely high risk, because it is the investment with the largest potential upside of any that I believe that I will ever be lucky enough to invest in during my lifetime. 
Bitcoin has going from trading for less than 1/10th of a penny, to $30, in under 4 years. That is an increase of more than 30000x value. To get it to be as valuable as an ounce of gold, it needs to increase only 60x more in value. That might still sound like a lot, but very very few people, companies, or institutions are currently invested in Bitcoin. There is, to my knowledge, only one single small fund on wallstreet, and it only holds 15% of its assets in Bitcoin. 
Again its risky. It could be more likely that it becomes worthless than that becomes worth as much as an ounce of gold. But I've never seen anything in my life that could grow as much as this could today.

Its more than that. Bitcoin is useful because it can be used to transmit value from one party to another, and to then convert that value (if necessary) into other goods, services, or currencies. 
The larger the marketcap, the better it is at transmitting value (because then the swings affecting that value are relatively smaller).  Therefore, the larger the marketcap, the more USEFUL Bitcoin is. 
In other words, the more valuable bitcoins become, the valuable Bitcoin IS. How's that for a cycle of prosperity?

I don't even know where to start. There are hundreds of alt coins. They weren't first to market and do not have the network advantage. They are also insecure because they could be killed easily from mining attacks using a tiny percentage of the current bitcoin network. For one of these to replace bitcoin, it will have to be so much better than bitcoin that it can outcompete bitcoin (even then, the best technology does not always win, see beta vs VHS). That isn't going to happen from tweaking coefficients, it would have to be through solving significant issues that bitcoin has not yet figured out AND COULD NOT COPY. Think about that. 
Who was initially rewarded for taking on risk and who owns a lot of coins (or as in the case of Satoshi, where that they have so far shown no desire or perhaps even ability to spend) has nothing to do with it "flying" as global currency.

Ok here's where I have gotten, if I've fucked up please tell me.
BTC value per hour = $130 * 25 (coins) * 6 (blocks per hour) = $19,500 / h
Supported watts per hour = $19,500 / 0.15 kw/h * 1000 w/kw = 130,000,000 w/h
Supported GH per hour = 130,000,000 W / 0.6 W/GH = 216,666,667 GH
I don't know how to go from that to the difficulty calculation.

In a nutshell its because transactions are both virtually instant and irreversible. If a private key gets exposed at all for any period of time, the money is gone gone. 
That means some keys need to never touch a computer connected to the internet ever. Also think of the trust needed in any employee with access. It's not the same as a theft involving a bank wire and withdrawal.

BULLSHIT, OR NO ONE WOULD BUY ELECTRONICS. Every single day I get more computer/phone/tv/gaming system/etc  for my dollar than the day prior. And yet here we are, still buying this stuff. Its not true for some electronics paid for in a certain currency. Its a property of the good. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:17:39
Imagine if you had a currency that was expensive to USE. How useful would that currency be? 
Bitcoin's value is derived from its usefulness. The only reason it is a better store of value then gold is because it is cheaper to store, divide, and transfer. If you degrade those properties, you degrade its value and adoption and you open the opportunity for it to be replaced.

I made a similar mistake during the last crash. Even after having a plan and being somewhat disciplined in not trying to time the market. 
I now completely ignore the price. My coins are not for sale and won't be in the near future regardless of price. 
I sleep a lot better. And virtually anyone who has sold at (nearly) any time this year has lost out relative to where things currently are. That's the reality, if you stop trying to time shit then the short term stuff doesn't matter anymore.

if you are looking at it as an investment. some people are looking at as superior money. so maybe it should occupy a portion of your cash position, and not just your speculative position. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:42:01
Pure speculation but it makes sense. Someone turns 6k into 1 million, are they going to keep all of that in coins? I love bitcoin but if I got to the level I would be diversifying. 
edit: to your point, these AM share purchases could mostly be existing coins looking for better returns. So in that sense, people are not buying BTC to invest in AM, people are trading already purchased BTC for AM shares, and then those coins are then being sold since the recipients now have A LOT of btc, driving down the price. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 17:27:49

This is indeed about math and not about greed. I have run the numbers myself, taking into consideration increased competition and potential scenarios. You and I have drawn different conclusions about that value of the company. That's fine.
You stated that you (re)bought shares at 2.5 and sold them at 3.4 . So apparently believed that they were worth the risk at a 30% discount to their current price. And now you are claiming they are in a bubble. If you actually believed they were undervalued at 2.5 (where you bought them) then you wouldn't believe that they were currently in a bubble, they would be at best in your opinion, overpriced by some amount less than 30% (obviously). 
You don't want to be wrong, you've already felt the pain of being wrong (which is why you sold and then rebought at a 25% higher price), and so now you want to scream loudly that the stock is in a bubble. That's ok, that's an emotional human reaction. That doesn't mean its logical or that everyone else is driven by greed.

But you are ignoring hardware sales and transaction fees. Hardware sales are limited by total bitcoins left to be mined. Transaction fees are not limited and could (will) exceed block rewards at some point in the future.

People said the exact same thing last April when it was $30. It never got back down there and they lost.
Maybe it has risen too fast, maybe it hasn't. Nobody has any fucking idea. If you buy in at the same regular intervals you spread out your risk with the longer trend.

There is tons of risk. You have all of these:
 
* All of the risk of BTC
* The risk of ASICMiner disappearing or failing to pay
* The risk of ASICMiner making bad decisions or failing to compete
* In the event that you are purchasing pass through shares, you also get all of the risk that the passthrough exchange goes down or that the owner can't or won't pay their dividends. 
Edit: Downvotes don't make any of this untrue. People should make informed decisions and be comfortable with the risk. Pumping shit up for new investors without being fair about the situation makes you an asshole.

@_date: 2013-07-09 16:30:43
First of all you don't know that. You have no idea of what difficulty will be in 6 months.  
Nor do you know whether an alt coin will be more profitable to mine than bitcoin (as PPCoin is right now) in the future, making miner more profitable IN BITCOIN.
Nor do you know what is going to happen with transaction fees in the future, changing the profitability of IN BITCOIN
Nor do you know if this was bought using BTC or cash, and whether the buyer has an easier time getting this on ebay for USD than getting BTC otherwise.
Nor do you know if the buyer would prefer mined coins over coins bought through places like coinbase or mtgox so that they can be more anonymous (what's that premium worth)?
Its not flawed logic. Some people do buy these before they ever have any bitcoin. Some people only care about ROI in fiat. Some people just like to mine and currently they HAVE NO OTHER REAL OPTION. All the attacks are ridiculous. The market has chosen this price and as far as anyone can tell,  sales volume is not a problem.

2 suggestions
1) Make the "why is this safe" section more prominent. People need to know that they can trust this.
 
2) Accepting tips is great, but for new people (your audience) they are going to need some help claiming the coins. Instructions or links to importing directions on popular online and offline wallets will help a ton.

0.018BTC/share came out of the solo mining wallet.  Also, not that I expect them to be able to, but they could double their network percentage and still be under 50%. So yes, they can get more out of mining then they currently are. But even if they don't, even if they can't sell hardware and dividends fall to 30% of what they currently are, its better than 10% annual return. I don't know where else I can get that. And I don't know why anything points to a massive crash.

setup dwolla and get some money in gox.  You can have coins whenever you want.

Umm, because if you bought coins at $150, and sold a portion at $350, $500, $750, $900, and $1150  you are doing fucking great right now.  
You know how I know that? Because that's what I did. You know why I did that? Because I wrote down my plan ahead of time and stayed true to it. Here is a post, by me, urging other people to do that when BTC was at $200. 
I got downvoted then and told that nobody asked for my advice.  And motherfuckers don't listen. I don't care any more, I try to help people and get bullshit the whole time. Do whatever you guys want, I'm buying up coins and sitting on them like I always do. 
edit: oh if you are trying to increase your holdings for the long run? Just dollar cost average in over time. I'm doing that anytime there isnt an obvious bubble going on.

The author conflates limiting dust spam (in the region of fractions of a USD penny) to limiting small transactions. You can still send 0.0001 ($0.01) very easily in Bitcoin land. In fact, I think that's my current average transaction fee.

@_date: 2013-10-21 16:22:33


In practice It has NEVER been scarce during the entire history of Bitcoin. Why the hell would we change this when the current system is obviously working. 
We need to have reasonable transaction fees to pay for the security of the network as the block subsidy decreases. Transaction fees are currently around 1% of the BTC created in a block and rising as usage increase. Should this actually become a problem, it can be addressed, but it is not certain that it will. What is certain is that bitcoin cannot become a global currency, nor can it remain useful, with the current limitation.
