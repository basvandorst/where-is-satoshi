That's the attitude I'm looking for.

Yes, 2014 isn't included because it didn't fit the pattern (nor is 2013 but Coinmarketcap doesn't provide data for that far back). Yes, I don't have a reason for the pattern. But I'm not claiming that 2014 fits the pattern, nor am I claiming that I have a reason for the pattern. I'm just pointing out that at this time of the year for the past 3 years in a row, there has been a noticeable dip. That's all. Take from it what you want. We both have our own opinion about the data and that's fine.

What did I say that was wrong?

I get what you're saying and technical analysis says that the dip might continue a little bit farther but personally I wouldn't risk selling the dip when consistent historical data points towards a rebound. You do you though and stick to what you think is right.

Any reason why?
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:14:17
Trust me, I'm usually the one to say that but 3 years in a row of consistent data is statistically pretty good and should have some analytical value.

It's an interesting theory. I don't know enough about Lunar New Year spending habits to confidently say that that would be the reason but it seems like a plausible explanation.

**Side note**: I'm not saying that in a year Bitcoin will be higher or lower than it is right now, I'm just saying that you probably shouldn't sell the dip. Also please don't take this as expert advice, because it's not.
