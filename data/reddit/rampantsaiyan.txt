Some have the best day of their lives, some the worst. I'm happy for you. I was grinding my way up. Every month I would put my student loan in btc and hoped to acquire 1 btc one day. Grinded to 0.21 and a month ago I had to sell my btc to support my family. Now I feel I will never catch up again.. On one side I feel good to have helped my family, but on the other side I just missed out big time :(
I hope you have a blessed life and hope that money won't change you
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:29:48
You're right, thanks.

Or a realistic significant crash/drop? :)

This is what I meant about that modern times are killing the true laws of Islam. When interpretations vary, there are always ones that are just plain wrong. Another interpretation is that traitors to the nation / terrorists are seen as apostates and they deserve the death penalty. This is not a topic we can discuss and come to an agreement through reddit. It needs research that is not biased but objectively made. And we are going off topic with this.

What will be the last stop for you? When will you bail out? What will you do? Cash out or trade it for another coin?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:53:49
I'll look into it, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:45:48
Meh, just doing some research how it relates to religion. Nothing wrong with some research right? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:20:33
Has it some kind of butterfly effect that can affect other people, like interest? No? Then it is fine. Thank you for your time. And the other topics I'd like to discuss, because I believe there is a reason behind everything and it just goes deeper than "executing, murdering etc." Killing apostates may be seen morally wrong. But I like to research what, why, when, how. As of now I have little knowledge of that specific topic. I'll let you know when I know more :) thanks again.

Thank you, the thing with him is, he has a rule of thumb when  you doubt something, consider it haram until you can prove it. I'll read this, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:07:27
Did he give any reasons against it and why it might be sinful? Or maybe even why it is halal
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:24:29
I'm still climbing my way up to 1 BTC :( it is rough, with my pay of my part time student job. But I've got high hopes and I even believe I can buy my own house in the future with the profit I will make!
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:11:41
Well the princes can go and shove their feet in their arses.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:06:31
"Other stuff" hahahaha, I feel you.

Why is vertcoin the future? I'm seriously considiring investing in it.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:09:07
I am religious too, but I am always open for controversial topics.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:56:13
He says when you don't earn money without working for it, it is sinful. But when I give gold as an example, he just changes subject and says he can feel and hold it unlike crypto.

Ahh okay, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:20:00
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:05:48
Because he can feel it :')
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:44:26
As far as I know of are only murderers get the death penalty. The "eye for an eye" law does also apply to us.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:57:33
Me too, then I can finally buy a house and other stuff ;D
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:40:17
I believe so too, but because my dad listened once to a fatwa of an Imam that doesn't know about bitcoin/cryptocurrency that classified it as a "waste of time" and therefore a sin.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:37:47
Nobody should be murdered/executed. Islam knows of death penalties, just like the USA. murderers don't get executed, they get the death penalty. No muslim can go and "execute" somebody because he believes he or she deserves so. It must be discussed in court first.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:09:24
Am I a Saudi because I'm muslim?
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:21:56
I hope witihin 10 years!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:05:00
Holy shit

He says The reason he accepts fiat is because there is apparently no other choice than fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:10:38
Let's get crazy and let me ask you: what about a million dollars? :D how long do you think that will take?
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:07:58
Let's buckle up then. Any other opinions, insights? What can you tell about the tech behind it etc and how this will affect the price etc.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:59:44
The price goes, like, 10x every year right? I'm in it since August.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:14:55
I also believe the end times are near. The signs are everywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:28:28
Or will it :)

Did my reply say anything about money? Please, I'm open for criticism, but not attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:33:55
Exactly this, thank you. I even believe it is better than fiat currency in relation with relgion because of this.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:23:25
Sadly modern times are killing the true laws, morals and society that religion had envisioned.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:37:25
I need to buy a house
The biggest donator may come and sleep over.

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:41:32
Holy shit this is nice
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:16:35
Yeah the blockchain is definitely interesting, but for it to be widely adopted, the price must stabilize first. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:11:20
He just shames me because I'm apparently "sinning" :') but I'm even confident that this kind of currency is even something that Islam wants. No debts, no interests no nothing. Total control over your own assets.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:58:42
So you say there will be swings in the range of 10k in the future?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:43:12
I want one too :(
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:34:14
This made me emotional for some reason. Congrats friend :)
