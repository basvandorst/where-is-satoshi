I'm not surprised Coinbase is willingly letting the US Government know about all transactions. We are probably on terrorist watch lists now and tax related things now.  and now my name is out there. Oh well. YOLO

This is what we have been waiting for. I gotta go sleep but I have a feeling my bitcoin alarm will be waking me up. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:17:18
The other day I was moving bitcoins from btce to coinbase. I did it 3 times and look what showed up the 3rd time (top line) 
Also, Coinbase e-mails me when I receive bitcoins and I never got an e-mail when I received the bitcoins the 3rd time.

Usually it is quicker but due to holidays and the weekend you gotta wait longer. You can verify your credit card just enter the total amount that shows up on your banking web site and since it is the holiday it will probably show up Thursday online. After this waiting period it goes much quicker.

I would guess the large bitcoin holders would dump and by the time the dumping ends and you get a chance to dump the price will be so low.

It seemed good at the time. The selling at the top or in the profit and being happy with what you made and not sticking around trying to double your money again is the hard part.

It does seem like someone is trying to cover their tracks. The total amount is suspicious as well. We might be on to something but that something is that this is looking like a true story. 
I clicked on a random one from the last link and ended up here  and almost 2 months later there is still bitcoins showing up. 
Even the first link just transferred out .0001 bitcoins and now up to 782,558.7251885 BTC that passed through. 
Some of these dates go back months so this could have been going on for awhile. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:36:48
It is implied that though this 'bug' someone or some people moved all of Gox's bitcoins to their own personal wallet. Sure Gox probably has a few thousand bitcoins still and what happens to those well either Gox hangs on to them or sells them on another exchange or gives them back to their customers till they run out.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:59:24
I would be raging so hard. Semi nice retirement gone. I've been in bitcoin for 15 months and somehow managed to start with $7,000 and end up with $6,000. Panic buying and selling and I lost all my profit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:55:57
Gox employees think people are buying and moving all their bitcoins off the exchange. Sometimes withdrawals get stuck or something else happens and they don't think the 2 are related. Keep feeding bitcoins to the hot wallet to keep up with the demand and eventually you figure it all out after you lost all the bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-01 11:15:37
Yeah coinbase got hacked. 
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:41:46
I'm sure you want step by step guide. Then answers to all the what if's. I'm thinking $30,000? What happens when you use coinbase and sell $30,000 worth of bitcoins to a bank account and put it towards a house. Wouldn't the IRS come wondering how $30,000 from coinbase showed up and why you didn't report it? If you report it then you have to pay taxes and how much is that.
It is a new way of moving money. I don't know if anyone here could tell you for sure what will happen. We can tell you how to do it but that's about it. The fees will add up depending on how much you are moving. 
Hopefully someone can chime in. I know this has been asked before. I'll see if i can find the thread.
@_date: 2014-01-09 08:38:15
I could have gone "all in" on litecoin at the end of the summer and bought 5,000 litecoins. Then I could have sat on them for a month and cashed out with over $225,000. This guy I know online took out a loan and sold their car to buy litecoins and now they have a shitton of money. Fuck I wish I did what they did.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:14:04
Gox thinks everything is normal. Someone is just moving bitcoins out. The don't think stuck transactions are related and keep moving bitcoins around till they are out.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:39:36
Just wait and watch. It takes days, weeks, months. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:12:06
The thing is so many people think like you. So say everyone buys in thousands. It goes up. The early adopters all cash out 5,000-10,000 and bring the price down. Then the ones that bought in high want to cash out. Will the price recover again? Is this just a dead cat bounce aka someone pumping bitcoin to unload again at a high price. Bitcoin is like nothing before and we are hoping the people with a large amount of bitcoin don't dump on us which lowers the price. Just don't want to see you lose it all. There was a guy yesterday that said he lost $450,000 so far but he was day trading and wasn't just holding waiting for the price to go up.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:30:33
Depends. I usually send a small (.05) amount to test. It has been quick to hours. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:00:27
If you started today maybe $1 / day. That amount goes down every 10 days too.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:37:45
Bought 40 on monday. They come tonight. Pumped that the price went up too. Pissed cause I could have bought 50 but didn't.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:48:43
It went up to $900. The people who sold wanted to sell and it went to $384. Now we are working at getting the price back to $900 and then will continue up to over $1,000. Up to you if you want to come with us.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:29:55
They buy in at $650. They watch it go to $900. It falls to under $400. They make a calculation and figure they just lost $2500. They sell thinking fuck I missed out on it. 
Little do they know that the price has always recovered and gone up. 
It is so easy for anyone to join that you need 0 experience. So the guys who never worked a day in their life and have a trust fund that they just bought in can make the price swing. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:27:53
All signs point to up. BUY BUY BUY

I highly doubt Coinbase has any impact on the price. The price going up and down is due to the exchanges like Gox, China, Bitstamp and BTCE. Coinbase prices their bitcoins based on the exchange prices. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:17:59
But the FBI press release said they have them in their control. I guess they could be not telling the truth but it does add up to me that the FBI does have them.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:28:50
I think bitcoin and even litecoin is risky right now. They both peaked, came down fast due to China news and then bounced back when everyone that sold bought back in. Now people are waiting to see if there is new money that will come in or if people will start selling and taking their profit. 
With litecoin it could end up on 2 big exchanges where there is more money and it could see the biggest gains right now. The biggest exchange is btc-e.com. Litecoin is rumored to end up on MtGox and BTCChina. The price is at $30 right now and it peaked at $48. It is only this high due to the rumors. The longer it takes for gox and china to add it the lower litecoin will go as people sell. Once they do add it I see everyone buying in trying to get in before everyone else and selling at the top. Money to be made there.

This has been happening since coinbase began. At first they ran out of bitcoins and had no warnings. So they created a high risk warning as their cover for when they run out of bitcoins.

I'm guessing under a million? I'm sure many people mined back in the day, got 50 bitcoins, realized it isn't even worth a dollar and deleted the wallet. People probably lost / forgot password for thousands of bitcoins. 
If you add up the largest 400 wallets there are still a lot of bitcoins out there. So they are spread out a lot so maybe millions are lost. The world will never know.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:18:18
30,000 people gave bitcoins to them to get in line and they still don't have a working unit. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:26:53
People are hoarding bitcoins so when people want to buy 20,000 bitcoins and there are only 25,000 being offered the price shoots up so there is enough for everyone. Once demand slows down and people want to cash out the price will drop.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:23:24
$60-$80 short term.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:55:15
The other option is wiring money to bitstamp but they have been having bank issues. MtGox has bank issues. BTCE is a shady russian exchange where money goes disappearing.  and buying in person is a good way to get bitcoins. Coinbase is good too when you don't buy during the peak / busiest times. I've bought and sold over 10+ times on coinbase and never had an issue. So many people use coinbase since it is the easiest way to buy from your home. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:13:00
Big banks. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:52:55
Basically people created copies of bitcoin. Right now no one is accepting anything but bitcoin. So basically these people mined a bunch of coins and are now trying to hype / pump it up so they can sell their coins they mined for real money and then buy bitcoins to spend them / gain more money / cash out. Now you'll probably say, "If bitcoin took off why can't these other coins?" Mainly because they do the same thing so if a company is accepting bitcoins why accept another coin when people can just buy bitcoins and be done with it. Just don't buy into the hype and then watch these people dump their coins and end up rich while you just lost a thousand. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:00:30
Best option is to buy bitcoins, sell things and buy bitcoin, work and use the money you make for bitcoins. If you buy 1-2 bitcoins for $1500 maybe they will be worth 2-3 times that amount in a few months. Still probably won't be enough for uni.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:04:24

Maybe. Greed is hard to control. People have a lot of nothing that turns into a lot of something and who knows what the price will do. More people need to be using bitcoins for gambling, porn, buying things with bitcoin instead of holding, waiting for the price to go up, take out and watch the market go up and down.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:18:44
Yeah, they must be favoring instant users first and if they have enough they let anyone buy and get locked into the price. 
Just think yesterday people bought bitcoins and got locked in at $700. On Friday when their bitcoins show up in their account the price could be $400 each. They just lost $300 * amount of bitcoins they have which could be in the thousands of dollars. Lets hope the price goes back up by the end of the week.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:45:32
On the right you see red arrows pointing down and green arrows pointing up. Red arrows down means someone with bitcoins hit the sell button and ended up with USD and brought the price down. (Which is happening a lot right now)
The green arrow means someone with USD hit the buy button and now have bitcoins which sent the price up. (Which happened a lot over the weekend and yesterday to $900 USD).
Not sure if that answers your question.
@_date: 2013-04-02 07:41:06
I would look at this chart and think it over. 
Last 7 days there was a dip. Last 30 days there were 4ish bigger dips. 
On the bottom chart there is a + / - on the top right corner. Click the - and hover over the red and green line. You get an idea of how many bitcoins are needed going both directions to get to a certain price. 
If more people in investing see this what's stopping a bunch of rich guys putting in a few thousand just to see where it goes. If someone put 1.5 million in right now we'll be at $115.00. If someone sold 27,000 bitcoins we would be at $88.

It was over the course of 2 years. Had thousands saved up and living at home. Working only 2 days a week. Had no bills. Nothing to do. Wasn't in college. Was trying to find a better job. Ending up losing all my savings. Started transferring money from my credit card till it was maxed out. Living pay check to pay check still going to the casino. Then my parents kicked me out of the house unless I went back to college. By the time they kicked me out I found a full time job thankfully and moved out. Payed off my credit card, had $3,000 saved up and found out about bitcoins. Now I'm almost at $9,000 in bitcoins. Not sure if I should cash out and wait for the price to come back down and buy in or just keep my bitcoins in. Right now I'm living pay check to pay check with a paid off credit card, no debt and $9k in bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-03-29 12:29:52
I guess people are figuring eventually the demand will be so little that when people sell no one is left to buy the bitcoins to keep the price steady or bring it back up. People figure only a small group of people will be interested in bitcoins and them alone won't have enough money to keep the price up.

You can't really call it day trading. More like 24/7/365 trading. 
I'm guessing some have alarms that go off. Some have programs that calculate the odds of it going up or down and buy / sell based on that. 
You just never know when a person with thousands of bitcoins decides to cash out or when a person wants to buy a ton. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:54:51

Yeah, looks like it got stuck on coinbase's side.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:04:47
What happened in April after it hit $266 it went down and bounced back up and then the hype died down and the price went to $60. Then some people bought back in. Then some more bought back in. Then people noticed the price went up and everyone started buying again. 
So I think once the media dies down and there are no new users finding out about bitcoin the price will slowly go down and once it is low enough people will start buying in again and it'll go back up. 
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:35:08
I wouldn't. Gox is having problems so people want out. Bitstamp is the  market right now and just look at that buy support...and then compare it to the sell walls. People want out and no one wants to catch the falling knife and be a bitcoin bag holder. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:01:09

@_date: 2013-11-23 03:38:36
Yeah if the price keeps rising and it never slows down or goes down. Eventually everyone will stop buying in and the people with thousands of coins will take their profit and buy back in cheap only to raise the price again and we'll do it all over again.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:49:19

Sellers. People who think a couple hundred bucks is a good outcome to a gamble. Win or lose a little.
Buyers. They don't want to see the price drop any further. Maybe to guide the price back up before they cash out. Some are probably storing funds in bitcoin as a last option sort of thing (government freezes their accounts so they have to use money in bitcoin).

The price follows closely to Bitstamp's price I've noticed. The price will rise once people stop selling and people begin buying bitcoins again on the exchanges (Gox, Bitstamp, BTCE). Till then the price will continue to go down. Sucks for those who got locked in at a high price and are waiting on bitcoins but that's bitcoin for ya. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:34:34
Man, It has gone $10 to $260 to $105 to $180 to $50 to $130 in  the last couple months. Buy low and sell high you would be doing pretty good right now.
Who knows what it going on right now. It could be 1 person still pumping it up only to dump later. 
It would suck to wait and see it never come back down in price. 
I don't know what to do. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:42:01
Did you look at your transactions? Where were they transferred to?
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:33:06
They promote the site here by giving out free coins to try. Mainly because it all ends up back in their wallet anyways. You basically gotta stalk /bitcoin/new to catch it.
@_date: 2013-11-17 07:51:42
 or you can wire money to an exchange like Gox or Bitstamp. USA you could check out  
The next crash aka someone or people selling around 80,000 bitcoins brings the price to around $120. So many people will see cheap bitcoins and the price will bounce up and down a few times. 
For now though it seems everything is holding up and people still have millions of dollars to buy in with. So for now if it does crash there are rich people there to catch the bitcoins and then buy all the cheap bitcoins and then the price will be right back to where it was and then continue higher. In the end what goes up must come down so we'll see what happens.

People will say anything in headlines to get you to click / view ads. People see headlines and then go tell friends what they read in a headline. Then they come to to talk about it. 
Really what most people want is a sign that says Bitcoin accepted here along with Visa, Mastercard. To be able to go to a Bitcoin shop and send money to family and they pick up the cash from the store in their home country and it is the cheapest option. To pay for things over the internet. To tip people. To pay for over the internet jobs. Homework help. Cheaper option over ebay. 
Maybe it'll come mainstream and at family gatherings they are talking bitcoin.

You can wire money to BTCE and get a cheaper price but it is a Russian site (people think it is shady and there are some posts about money going missing) then buy bitcoins and sell on localbitcoins (you set your own price on that site). 
It is risky if you are trying to buy at one place and sell at another because the price could go down at any moment. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:51:03
Not gonna lie. Drugs mostly. People that buy normal stuff must have so many coins that it's like getting stuff for free.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:46:53
You wire money from your bank to MtGox to buy bitcoins. No ones money is showing up on Saturday or Sunday so they gotta wait till Monday to buy. So the people on the weekend don't see the price going up and sell into the people buying which is us because we love cheap coins.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:00:35
As usual at this stage in the game people heard, watch the price go up and then want to buy in at the top, only to watch the price fall, then sell and take their losses, then watch the price go back up. 
So if you do buy in buy and hold even if the price falls and wait for it to go back up. 
Invest only as many as you can afford to lose. Say it goes down and never goes back up then you have to be happy taking out half what you invested. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:50:31
It all depends if the sellers out match the buyers. Right now the buyers are winning but the sellers may be waiting for a higher price. But then if they sell the buyers see the lower price and buy the cheaper bitcoins they would have otherwise bought at a higher price. 
In other words it isn't too late. Buy and hold and see where the price is next year.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:07:22
Just wait till they run their next audit and it'll fix everyone's balance.

I would split it up. BTCE, Bitstamp, Gox (so if one site goes down you won't lose all your money / bitcoins). When you are ready to sell to a bank account move all the bitcoins to the site you want to use. Prediction for this year is bitcoin goes up a couple thousand so don't sell too soon.
Edit: There are other exchanges too. Maybe even keep some bitcoins on blockchain.info too.

@_date: 2013-04-09 00:03:12
This is how silkroad works. Someone sells an item for $1,000. Say at the time it was $100 a bitcoin so they spent 10 bitcoins. The money goes into escrow and is converted to dollars. So the $1,000 sits in escrow till the person gets their item. Then the vendor gets their bitcoins and if it were today they would get like 5.5 bitcoins. Then the vendor cashes out to pay the people for more items. So no, vendors are not really making much money unless they are keeping their money in bitcoins after they receive their payment. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:39:39
Someone wants to buy 14,000 coins @ $90. So we won't be going under $90 till we have enough sellers.

Probably getting attacked by antibitcoin people. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:39:42
Walls as in someone wants to buy 5,000 bitcoins so someone needs to sell 5,000 bitcoins before the price goes lower. So most likely the price won't go below there and will go up.
On the flip side if someone wants to sell 5,000 bitcoins I wouldn't be buying any because the price most likely will be coming down.
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:29:54

There needs to be a device that people can buy that holds your bitcoins securely and that allows you to transfer them to a hot wallet when you want to use them. Make it as easy as possible and the average Joe will be able to buy and safely hold bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:08:27
The thing is if you sell you either transfer to your bank account (pay taxes) or sell and hold the money in the exchange (and hope the exchange doesn't shut down with your money). It is better to just hold. Besides if you sell right now there are people waiting to buy the price back up to where it was. People (rich people) still think the price is cheap. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:35:56
I wish. I should have listened to everyone saying buy and hold. Before I found out about bitcoin I gambled away $30,000 at the casino and went into debt. Was able to get out of debt and then found out about bitcoin. I put all my money into bitcoin and had 50 bitcoins and was thinking about using my credit card and buying 200 more bitcoins. In April the price crashed and that's when my gambling began trying to day trade. Today I'm down to under 10 bitcoins when I should have just bought and held at least 50 bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 08:01:07
Right, that is always in the back of our heads. For purchases you hold it in escrow and once you receive the item and it is what you want you can release the bitcoins and the person gets paid. 
If it isn't what you ordered or it is broken then you return it or the 3rd party decides who gets the bitcoins and what not. Not always a perfect outcome so credit cards will always be around and be an option.
If companies only use bitcoin then they would make sure to keep their customers happy or else word will spread and no one would use them because of the bitcoin nature.
And yes I'm always worried about the people who bought thousands of bitcoins for cheap or mined them. They can drop 5,000-10,000 over and over and it'll be a big mess of the price always bouncing around.

If you are planning on buying $60 a month and holding onto it for 4+ years then yeah I would do it. If you are thinking a couple months to a year you may be able to cash out and have $100+ more then you started with. You may have less. If you hold for 4+ years that may turn into thousands. It is worth the risk I think.

@_date: 2013-11-11 07:55:21
The 24 hour volume is just how many bitcoins were bought  or sold. It is a rolling 24 hour so it is always changing. 
It is tough to predict the next move. No one knew Sunday when it was $215 that by the end of the week it would be almost $400. People just started buying in which caused other people to buy in before the price went up. Then all the big players that wanted to buy in did and the price was holding steady. Someone decided it is a good time to sell 2,000 bitcoins and then someone else sold another 2,000 bitcoins. A bunch of smaller people sell and that adds up. Then people think I should sell and then 12,000 bitcoins are sold. Price goes down to $290 and the rich people say that's enough and buy so the price goes up $30-$40 and people see that it is going back up and start buying. Everyone else decides to stop selling and now the price sits at $343. No we wait to see if someone has a few million to spend and maybe the price will go up near $400 again. On the flip side people may think this is taking too long and sell a few thousand bitcoins and we go down under $300 again. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:52:00
And with no one selling we'll just be waiting on the new new money to roll in. Look at the support too. So much money. It'll take someone with 15,000+ coins to cause a panic and even then we'll probably recover.

Eventually it'll barely move. If it does it should move up. In the future the buy and sell walls will be so huge people can move millions without moving the price down. Now this is if billionaires and mutli millionaires buy in.

It is true that transactions can sometimes take tens of minutes to become confirmed. Despite this, retailers can accept unconfirmed transactions with very little risk by simply 'listening' on the network for a double-spend transaction, or partnering with a company that provides this service. After a head start of merely several seconds, the original transaction would reach so much of the Bitcoin network that a fraudulent double-spend transaction would almost certainly be fruitless. An attacker would have to commit easily-detectable fraud, in person, several hundred or several thousand times, before one of these low-value double-spend attempts would likely succeed.
An attacker could work around the necessity of sending out a second fraudulent transaction to the Bitcoin network by attempting to solo-mine an attack block containing the attack transaction himself - temporarily withholding the block with the rest of the network - and then execute the fraudulent purchase within seconds, or minutes at most, of mining the attack block, before broadcasting the attack block. However, the cost of such an activity would dramatically outweigh the value of anything typically offered without a confirmation wait for several reasons.
First, mining a block (attack or otherwise) entitles the miner to a valuable block reward, and because the attack involves temporarily withholding the block from the network, the attacker would put himself in the likely position of his block becoming stale, which would result in forfeiture of the entire reward. Most solo miners solve less than one block per month, so this would represent the loss of proceeds of potentially several weeks of mining.
Second, it is not possible for a solo miner to know exactly when his mining activity will yield a block, and because the attack must be carried out within seconds or minutes of successfully mining a block, the attacker will not be able to know or plan in advance the brief window when the attack would be likely to succeed. While it may be easy for a determined attacker to get low-value items that are sold and delivered online instantly without waiting for confirmations (such as downloads), this unpredictability and the briefness of the opportunity would make it extremely difficult to commit any kind of fraud where real-life interaction is required, such as visiting a merchant or taking possession of goods. Petty shoplifting would be far simpler. Even if an attacker went forward with this attack, the retailer would be notified of the fraud the moment the attack block is released seconds later.
In short, the 10-minute wait for confirmation is only practically necessary when delivering goods of value that significantly exceed the block reward an attacker would have to risk to perform an attack and where recourse after delivery is practically nonexistent, such as money transfers.

A lot of us knew about bitcoin but never bought a lot because we didn't see this coming. People would buy hundreds of bitcoins and then spend them since they were only $10. I did notice people buying a lot but never knew why. I even had the chance to buy litecoins at 7 cents a piece and could have bought thousands and I could have hundreds of thousands of dollars right now. I wish I read more into bitcoin instead of just buying enough to spend. 
Anyways what you can do now is buy bitcoins and then hold a few bitcoins / litecoins / namecoins. Hold them for years and hope the really rich people put their millions into bitcoin and other coins and then the 3-4 bitcoins or 500 litecoins or 1000 namecoins you bought are worth thousands of dollars in the future. Just think if you buy 4 bitcoins now for $3,000 and the really rich people buy bitcoins like crazy and soon the price is $100,000 and now you have $400,000 in bitcoins. I doubt that would happen though because people will always be selling bitcoins and I doubt there will be enough rich people to keep the price up that high. So in the end you can buy a couple coins but you will be working a boring job for the rest of your life and never be rich because only the early adopters will be rich off bitcoin. You could try buying litecoins but there are so many litecoins that I doubt the price will go high and stay high. Short term you may double or triple your money if were lucky.

What there needs to be is a well designed web site that ranks bitcoin web sites. So people can review them and as a community figure out the legit bitcoin sites that we want to spend their bitcoins at. The more trustworthy / popular (in a good way) the site the better. I'm sure there would be a way to run ads from these stores too on the site.

All the coins!! NVC went from $7 to $28. LTC from $1.60 to $11.50 and NMC went from 70 cents to $2.30 and PPC and XPM more than doubled. Couple more altcoins doubled or more over the last couple days. You're missing out on thousands of dollars. If you bought at $30 you would have hundreds of thousands.

Your current price looks to be 462 
Localbitcoins they set their own price. You meet up with the person and trade cash for bitcoins.
I would use blockchain.info for a web wallet. 
I would look at this as a long term investment. I'm talking years. With a small investment you may be able to send a kid to college in the future.

I've been following since the start and some people mined it and were trying to sell 2,000,000 worth right away that they mined. The way it is designed is there are 100 billion dogecoins total and they are mined quickly. Whether you agree with that or not is up to you. I think it was a smart move because when people think about mining or buying thousands or millions they feel better about it and promote it more. 
Yes, dogecoin is kinda like Quark is the sense there are a lot of coins quickly. The only difference is Quark got no hype till all the coins were mined and Dogecoin has been in the news since the beginning. Just because you were late to hear about it and missed the boat doesn't make it an instamined or premine scam.

What I did my first time. blockchain.info for a wallet. Then bitinstant deposit at a bank and I had bitcoins in under 15 minutes. Since bitstant doesn't do bank deposits anymore I use Bank of America (bitfloor.com) or Wells Fargo (bitcopia.com) and get my coins a couple minutes after the deposit.

Where were your coins and how did they just disappear. Something doesn't sound right.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:38:18
If I follow it sounds like...
They ran out of bitcoins so you sent coinbase $616 to buy bitcoins. They will take the $616 and use it to buy bitcoins on Friday at the market price and deliver them to you. On Friday the price is $755. So then they take the $616 and figure out how many bitcoins to give you based on the current price of $755.
The cancel thing I'm unsure of. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:55:03
All scams or you get like a penny.

@_date: 2013-04-09 02:07:08
Just take a look at  and the efforts to get everyone taking bitcoins to take litecoins. I will say if I bought thousands of litecoins at 7 cents or mined thousands I would want litecoin to take off so there will be buyers so I can cash out my $100,000+ in litecoins. But since I never bought into litecoins and now watching everyone try to find buyers so they can get their litecoin money into bitcoins or USD is tiring. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:54:29
$73 and still going strong. We'll see if it pops at $80
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:03:42

A person or persons have brought millions of USD worth into bitcoins. I hope people don't panic sell. Stay in and wait for the next boost.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:10:09
If you wait till Friday and they have bitcoins you can buy some (around $900?) and then you wait 6 days to get the bitcoins in your account (Worth $1,000+ then?). 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:30:38
Android app works too. You will have a bitcoin address and you give that out to people and they send bitcoins to that address and you'll see it on your phone. 
Blockchain.info is a web wallet and they also have an app. This site explains it well. I would read every word and turn this into a hobby. 
I would use blockchain (up to you though) that way you can go to a web site on your computer and transfer bitcoins in and out and also check up on your bitcoins from your phone.
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:02:47
I am so nervous. Tons of people are buying in and price is going up to $900. Support down to $800 is a lot. So people are transferring millions in still. Will it crash soon. Will exchanges be overloaded and shut down and take our money and bitcoins. Make sure you are willing to lose everything you put in. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:31:59
It was China buying back in. They found a new way to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:16:41
Buy at coinbase. If you want your coins instantly add a phone number and Visa credit card. It is 1 bitcoin instantly a day till your first 30 days are up and then it is 10 bitcoins instantly a week. 
Once you get your bitcoins never sell it via coinbase. Unless you are out of the game for good or need the cash to buy something (you can also use your bitcoins to buy stuff).
One you have your bitcoins from coinbase send them to mtgox, bitstamp or btce. Those exchanges will allow you to buy and sell instantly between bitcoin and USD. 
Once you are happy with your amount of bitcoins you can send them to a paper wallet and wait a few years and hope bitcoin caught on in a big way and hopefully your bitcoins are worth a lot of money.
Remember: By low, sell high. Wait a few days / weeks if need be to buy back in lower. If you are losing bitcoins day trading stop and hold. If you lost 2 bitcoins day trading those 2 could be worth thousands later on.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:49:56
Yes. Add a Visa credit card and you should be able to buy 1 instantly. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:43:49
People are demanding bitcoins and there are only so many so people can sell them at a higher price and people will pay for them. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:56:07
They all of their downsides. BTCE has altcoins but is from Russia (but I think it is pretty good and has been around all year) and bitstamp is good too but goes down. Gox is good but goes down. Finex is good but gets slow and goes down. 
Pretty sure there is a person or group that attack the exchanges and bring them down. I would spread your bitcoins out to each exchange so if 1 goes down you can still trade.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:24:39
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:48:31

It only takes so many millions of dollars to move the price up. When you have millions and millions of dollars the price goes up quickly as you buy in. No one wants to sell because they will wait and sell for a higher price. Look out though when the selling starts. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:36:28
It'll always go down but the new low will always be higher. It went from $900 to $384 recently and it only hit $384 because this dude sold 8,000 bitcoins and it scared a couple people that sold and brought the price down a little more. Then the guys with millions bought in and now we're back to $831. Seeing it go up so high so quickly is good and bad depending on how you look at it.
It's just no one knows if there is another person with 8000 bitcoins that will sell. If there are a couple people with enough bitcoins together to sell to bring the price down. The higher we get the more bitcoins it takes to bring the price down and when it gets low to most people it looks cheap and they want to buy more bitcoins. 
But then in April it went from $266 to $60. Just hurts my head trying to think about it. It was sitting between $100-$200 all summer.

You can protect your wallet. Bitcoin could go from $94 to $74 in a matter of minutes and there could be no one to buy the price back up to the $90's. Then either more people sell and bring the price down or we slowly buy more coins to bring the price back up. 
It isn't too late. If the hype dies down and people start talking about bitcoins less and the price doesn't go up much in weeks then maybe sell or only keep as much as you can afford to lose. 
For now though it seems to have enough demand to keep going up. Only time will tell. So buy in or watch from the sidelines. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:15:06

Someone put it up to stop the price from falling. In the end though someone decided to sell enough bitcoins and the price went to $790. Most of the time it just prevents the price from dropping further and usually the price moves back up.

Say someone wants homework help and will pay .05 BTC for the answer and the person has to show their work. 
Of course there will need to be some kind of escrow service. So the person puts .05 BTC into it. A person says they will do it. So they do it and show the work. Now how does one make sure the person that gave the answer gets paid? If we leave it up to the person asking the question they can say the answer isn't right and request the bitcoins back even if the answer is right. The seller can't request it because they can just make up an answer and get paid. If a 3rd party looks they may not understand what they are looking at and won't know who to give the bitcoins to.

These other coins are worthless right now. You can buy 200 litecoins for $1200 and that's it. You are basically hoping to sell them to the next sucker for a profit. The trollbox is full of people on btce telling you to buy these coins so they can sell them to you and they make money. Then you will try to sell them for a higher price before the price crashes. The trollbox calls litecoins chicken and are trying to get people to hype it up with them. Litecoins went up 600% are are still as useful as they were at 7 cents (which is no use).

The price will be in the hundreds with China always buying. I'm guessing there is $50,000,000+ in money ready to buy all the bitcoins people sell and to buy in and send the price up. If all these people want to buy in and new people keep showing up with money I see $1,000+ easy.

@_date: 2013-11-11 04:27:23
Last night there was a bunch of people selling. It seems it stopped and slowly climbing up to around $330 as people buy back in before the pumping begins. The new buyers will bring the price back up to $400 this week.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:41:46
Oh yeah the .0005 fee or close to that. 
Blockchain allows you to download the wallet.dat file which holds the bitcoins. You also need the private key which is on the blockchain web site. With the key and wallet.dat file if for some reason the web site is down you can use a program and load the wallet.dat file and use the private key to unlock it and still access your bitcoins. So far blockchain has been reliable though. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:58:37
The period ending March 31st has all the bitcoins still in the address worth over 1 million today. Not sure how they pay or I should say who pays in USD and keeps the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:51:23
Bitcoin is more widely accepted right now. You can buy LTC, PPC, DVC, NMC, NVC, TRC. Ah just look at them all here. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:09:55
Probably because Coinbase blocks it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:41:02
Litecoin was pumped from 7 cents to $4 and now they are trying to find people to buy the worthless coin to make money. They say it will be accepted everywhere bitcoin is accepted but don't believe that. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:25:52
You can see them here 
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:13:46
I'm buying 25 more bitcoins while I still can. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:24:27
Buy a ton of bitcoins. Go to bitstamp, btce, mtgox and send your bitcoins to the exchange. Then buy and sell when you want. Remember sell high, buy low!
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:28:05
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:50:18
Amazon created their own coin already. 
Once the big exchanges add altcoins like PPC, NMC, LTC they will go up because of the bigger user base and more money. When you see LTC at $10, PPC at $2.20 and NMC at $2.50 and BTC at $900 what would you rather buy when you have a million dollars. I'm betting everyone goes for the cheaper coins. 
I remember seeing PPC at 10 cents and told people to buy it. I never bought and now look it is at $2.14 on btce. FFUUU. I could have hundreds of thousands of dollars in altcoins if I bought in April.
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:39:02
I've heard all sorts of stories. From just sending $500 at a time to stay under the radar to $16,000 and buying a car. I know for the casino if you win over $1,199 you need to report it.

It isn't going to replace anything. If anything it'll be a paypal competitor. People will only spend bitcoins on sites that have a high reputation. Instead of replacing there will be new ideas on what to use bitcoins for. Some web sites charge money to read. Instead they can charge a small sum of money to read 1 article and let you pay in bitcoins. Some people live in countries where they want to buy stuff online or spend money online but can't. With bitcoins they can. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:34:31
I can buy things online without giving out my info. One less list I'm on although I'm sure my info gets sold to all the big players in the end.

Hope no one dumped. $73 right now!!!
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:30:18
Buy now and hold for 4+ years or buy now and sell before the correction. A correction means demand died out and the price will fall till people stop cashing out. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:34:38
ANC, MEC, FST all going up last couple days. The altcoins on BTCE are too high now. Everyone will keep looking for the next cheapest one to buy. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:00:38
Looks like it peaked at $900 and we are slowly going down for good. Bitcoin had a good run.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:31:02
You don't.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:42:00
Gox seemed to hold up well during the drop from $900 to $600 today. There isn't really that many options if you want to sell high and buy low. I use btce. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:57:46
Nope. $22 was a hella good price.
@_date: 2013-03-28 10:09:50
Almost there. Keep driving the price up for no reason guys. We can do it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:47:39
Sure ya did
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:00:36
May that be worth thousands one day. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 02:27:17
Nice. I remember browsing the deep web and it looked like buying bitcoins was too hard. A year later it was easier so I did. Then all of a sudden it started going up so I bought a few more. The rest is history.
I remember people posting, "I'm just going to buy as many bitcoins as I need for my purchase. I'm not into the whole bitcoin thing." I bet they wish they were now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:23:33
Well the only thing that is keeping the price where it is now is $1,000,000. If someone wanted to cash out and have a couple thousand they would bring the price down to $50. Who knows if people would buy it back up. Then more people figure $50 is still high and cash out and then the price keeps going down. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:56:29

I've been using coinbase since they started.
When they run out of bitcoins there is a warning. It says something like, "We are currently out of bitcoins. You will get the amount based on the current market price 5 days from now."
Now if there was no warning and it looks normal and you bought .5 bitcoins at $309 and it was locked into that price then yeah that is strange. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:49:58
I hope you're right. I want to see prices climb next week.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:14:40
The million dollar question. Will there be greedy people that sell and bring the price down or will there be new rich people moving money into the exchanges and pushing the price into the thousands. I say put in what you can afford to lose. If the price does go down it'll be at this price point again. I don't think people will stop buying in.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:10:51
As long as people buy over 4,000 bitcoins a day we will go up. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:38:54
Sometimes they run out of bitcoins and you get the bitcoins based on the price on a certain date. Only buy when you can get locked into a price or buy instantly!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:14:38
Pretend the market crashed to 0. The bitcoins are worthless. Now you need to go on with your life or buy back in at a later time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:21:41
Put some in BTC and LTC and hold. Watch the price over the next few months and you should make it back. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 09:03:01
If it was easy there would be other companies doing the same thing. Cut them some slack as demand &gt; bitcoins. Canceling orders is done by a computer.

High risk cancellations and now the last couple weeks of unexpected growth hurt coinbase. I see them over coming this and being a go to site for bitcoins in the future though.

You have 800000 microbitcoins. Congrats!
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:56:08
The future could be bitcoin stores where all they do is buy and sell bitcoins. Hopefully ATMs can be used too. Put them into airports and maybe there is a way to sort the money that is put into the machine and give it back out so no one would have to open it. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:31:22
Can't believe I watched it go from $50 to $128. Need to panic buy sooner. I wonder if it will dip again or if this is the lowest it'll go.
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:48:51
That's the thing. 11 million bitcoins out there and only 30,000 for sale on mt.gox.  People are saving which drives up the price.

We buy more bitcoins and send this rocket to the moon.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:46:25
Hmm, I would go to  and sign up for an account. Then open the app on your phone and log in. Set up 2 factor authorization so you have more protection. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:18:54
I would hang on to them. Panic buyers trying to get back in before the price goes up. Then you sell at the top.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:49:16
I tell my friends, "Maybe $4,000 or $40,000 or $400,000. I'll see when it get there." I would just sell a little bit for cash if I needed something. Otherwise try to buy it with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-31 04:07:19
The guy posted awhile back if they only hit $300,000 he would be OK and happy.

Depends when the rich people stop buying thousands of bitcoins and start selling.

It'll keep going up. $73!!!
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:43:16
When we notice the bitcoins moving everyone drops their buy orders and puts up new ones at $1. So when they sell everyone gets cheap coins. Then the price shoots back up.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:16:07
btc-e.com I was a noob and used coinbase but the wait killed me and I lost lots of money. Now I can day trade and lose lots of money instantly at btc-e.com

Learn the best way for you to buy half a bitcoin (or less if that's all you can afford). Hours / days / weeks / months worth of info and charts to read and look at. Sounds like a lot and it is but it's fun and you learn something.

@_date: 2013-03-28 07:15:16
Yeah, I've been telling people about bitcoins when it was $10 and I was seriously telling people at $30. Only I was smart enough to buy a lot of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:42:20
Hehe. You should buy bitcoins and then use them to buy litecoins. A litecoin 31 days ago was $1.60 you could have bought 2000 litecoins for $1,250. Today the 2000 litecoins would be worth $19,800 and it's going to go up a lot more.

High risk but you can try again in a few days because you won't be high risk then. AKA we ran out of bitcoins so try again later. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:02:48
It is under attack by an anti-bitcoin group.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:54:57
Woohoo. I was a noob once and I wish I read and took more risks early on. Before the April bubble I bought a handful of bitcoins. There was a person spamming this sub about litecoin and that we should buy some. I looked into it and it was around 7 cents. I'm thinking who would buy that when bitcoin is going up really high. I looked into litecoin for a few minutes and figured it was too hard and I would just hold my bitcoin. If I took the risk of buying litecoins with my bitcoins I would have well over $100,000 in litecoin today (if I bought and held all this time). So yeah moral of the story is to buy and hold. The more people that do the higher the price goes and it won't come down. You can buy gift cards with bitcoins and then buy things you need and save the rest of your bitcoins or other coin and watch your money grow. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:10:57
A true sad story. I once had $30,000 in the bank. I was young and dumb. I bought tons of alcohol and spent all my time at the casino. Ended up in debt. Found out about bitcoin when it was $10. Put the little money I had into bitcoin. Still not rich and never will be bitcoin rich. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:47:28
You can buy .05 of a bitcoin a month. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:01:34
Nice. I wish I realized at the time I should buy and hold as I was buying hundreds of bitcoins to buy stuff with.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:24:26
First it is coindesk not coinbase. Secondly, highly doubt the police will have a cyber crime unit on the ready to deal with stolen bitcoins. 
You'll just have to buy some more bitcoins and wait for the price to go up to make up for this loss.
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:24:45
That'll get you started.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:06:13

@_date: 2013-11-23 02:03:11
Hey man. The trick is to buy and hold. Wait for the billionaires, mega millionaires to buy in. They have so many millions that the market isn't big enough for them yet.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:24:49
Nope. If you buy today the price will go to over $110 tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:02:57
Easy. Buy when it goes down. Sell when it goes up.
It's just hard calling the bottom and the top. You don't want to buy, watch go down and never come back up to where you bought. You sell for a loss. Then it jumps up and you have to buy higher. Now all of a sudden you are losing money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:23:39
Right now we are in the jack the price up stage. Once we are rich we can start buying stuff with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:25:19
Lay off the drugs.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:46:14
It said "this site is under construction" or something like that and there was nothing to click.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:28:52
Price going over $200. Hopefully everyone held. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:50:01
We don't know the original DPR wallet. All I know is I think this is where all of DPR's bitcoins ended up. 
I looked back as far as I could and got to this page  where 10,000 bitcoins came from a bunch of different addresses. 
So the FBI got the bitcoins, put them in 1 wallet and will spend them / sell them when they are allowed to.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:55:12
Hopefully you got over your fear of buying. $73 today!!

The private key looks like
Then if needed you can download the Bitcoin-Qt program and load the wallet.dat file and input the key. 
I would copy all the text in the box and put it in a password zip file and keep it safe.

Coinbase gets hundreds of e-mails / support requests a hour. If they are not working support 24/7 they must pile up fast. Mostly noobs asking about how to get rich quick and other junk. I would personally shoot myself if I had to deal with their support so don't be surprised if it takes 7-14 days to hear back as they weed through all the junk.
