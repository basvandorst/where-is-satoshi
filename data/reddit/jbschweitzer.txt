There was an thread about this last night that end up with 100 or so people chiming in. The consensus from both the 75% downvoting of the thread, and of the top comments was clear:
"Socializing" isn't an option. BFX, having kept user wallets separate, couldn't seriously consider dipping into the wallets of every user on the site. 
If there is a plan to aid those hurt here, aid them, but with no other currency or fiat affected, simply NOT robbing them keeps BFX in business and with the trust of most users.
"Spreading the pain around" is, without a doubt, not an answer.

Bitfinex is absolutely under no sort of obligation to hold all users funds hostage until their plan to address losses for others is 100% complete.
They need to assist as many as they can, and as quickly and safely as they can. Taking care of withdrawals for those banging at the door to get funds that are available solves the issue for the likely majority of users. Then attention will exclusively be on effected users, but with trust intact from the majority. Give it time.

BFX could be taking on loans as we speak-- 
has mentioned another announcement coming shortly?
We need some transparency on numbers here. Let's keep this all above water to keep folks happy as you can.

They haven't announced insolvency. On the contrary, they've announced eventual return to full functionality. Give. it. time.

Sorry guys, but this is fake. His only other post was 3 days ago, unconfirmed by anyone else, and without any evidence.

What defines a US customer? What if we're just in crypto and not US ID verified?

Thank you.

1. Will BFXTokens be replaced with the original token represented in time, or with the USD equiv at the time of the attack?. Let's say BTC grows to 1K, or ETH returns to 22$. **If someone had 1000ETH removed from their account, are they getting 1000ETH,  10K, or 22K USD?**
2. The mentioned disabling of US Accounts from trading BFX-- Would their ability to withdraw to another exchange trading these be affected in any way?
3. **What defines a US customer?** What about folks not ID verified, but trading from a US IP?

That's... really not enough. I lost money too, and this is baseless.

"if their assets are lower than their liabilities". This hasn't been stated, thanks and bye

Can I get an ELI5 Summary of what the wall is? I'm staring at the chart, but not getting if something major happens when it's filled, or if it's happening as we go with the current 560~ price.?

I hate to disagree with the other commenters here, but I strongly feel that the best phone on the market is actually a deviation of LG's flagship, which features a slightly smaller screen than the G2, but is completely for to Google Stock &amp; standard. Also, for an UNLOCKED phone, this completely unique and different recommendation from those below is only 349 from Google's Play store.

I think he's critiquing the OP-- :p

VERY quick response from the official team. 
OP brings up a few solid points, but depending on the quality of your team, there's no reason why they can't be resolved.
Coinbase and every other exchange or conversion site also own bank accounts etc... 
Still, "in cooperation with the community" is the best part of your reply. Many of us here can be pretty loud w/ our opinions-- It's good to hear that some devs are listening rather than rushing to an incomplete launch.

Huh?
