Seems fishy. Why would you agree to an interview on something you only know a little about?

Your local ‘corner boy’ will never use it, it will always be in local currency.
It supports the international side of it.
Sure, it’s a public ledger, but most people involved in the bigger side of international operations will have access to identity theft too. This means they can set up fake credit cards in that persons name then withdraw from a bitcoin atm.

This is the current problem with it.
If everyone just hodl and no-one spends the price will rise temporarily (which it has), but it won’t become a world spread economy and will eventually fail.

I’m sure there’s a business term for this, but if you want to lock down a certain business, you can advertise as multiple businesses that essentially all do the same thing with a few extra charges on each. (Think insurance companies).

Remember, most gay people tend to be rich.
Not sure whether just smart or not kids though...

Hardly even crypto when to cash out 20k+, the government finds out anyway

I honestly see this as the same thing as the dotcom bubble for this reason. There are more popping up daily trying to get a slice of the pie.
Sure, bitcoin and eth could be the equivalent of amazon and eBay when it all implodes?

People who complain about the fees are also the people expecting to turn a $50 investment into a million.

Yeah, I do. You can buy certain things - generally repititive tech products that cost nothing extra to make copies of - it’s worth the risk to them to get an extra customer and publicity.
Almost everyone else that accepts it as payment has it linked to be made into US dollars as soon as the transaction goes through.

Of my group of mates / work colleagues, almost all of them know about bitcoin. One got into it in the early days and has made a mint for himself. A couple are just getting into it (coincidentally they all have the same type of personality / beliefs of ‘surfer types’ / hippy / fuck the government - I’m going to live on a block of cheap land in a shipping container. They all believe their $50-200 investment is going to make them a millionaire if bitcoin goes to 10mil/coin. 
What I’m getting at is maths isn’t their strong point, they’ve seen something rising in value quickly and decided to buy some ‘just incase’ it’ll make them rich.

Hardly sane if it has swings of +-15% daily. Maybe when it finally stabilises. 
By your logic, 1 USD = 1 USD and we as a world may as well just live on 1 currency, not currencies of different countries.

There’s literally 5-10 new coins every day. Bitcoin and maybe a couple others will end up being the eBay / amazon and survive for a longer time after a huge dip.

Wrong. If they set a price of $40 or .004 BTC and the price of bitcoin goes up, they would make more on it. The transaction fees on bitcoin are becoming rediculous, steam isn’t going to hold onto every transaction then cash out at the end of the month - they set it up as straight into fiat. They’re probably also worried it’s going to drop soon.

OP is obviously a stereotypical American. America - the biggest, the best, the only country - no others exist or matter.
Everyone has their moon - for some it’s 10k USD or 100k USD, for others it could be 10k Euro or even 100 goats in some countries.
Let them have their fun when it hits 10k euro. It needs to happen if you want bitcoin to be a global currency.

The difference being that gold has real life applications. We wouldn’t have computers/hard drives without it for instance.
Jewellery / showing off wealth also comes in to play.

No, you need at least 1.05 million. 5% is a good number to retire on

Not sure about this, but I’d be surprised if the people who own most of the exchanges (mt gox, coinbase etc) weren’t the people who created bitcoin.
