That is true. This happens when the guy who got the $90 loan pays it to another guy for some good or service, who then deposits it again, allowing the bank to loan out $81 extra, then $72.90, and so on.
Each step involves the bank storing 10% of the deposit in the vault and loaning 90%. Each step is backed by some guy owing the bank $90, $81, $72.90, and so on, presumably with some collateral even. Those liabilities, the stuff they bought, the increased productivity and extra profits that stuff allows, and the collaterals, all are very different from thin air.

You're not the first person in this thread with a wrong idea of that, so I think I was right: a lot of bitcoiners are OK with their investments being backed by thin air because they buy into completely wrong explanations of how the traditional banking system runs on thin air.

No, I'm saying that believing in what a lot of other retards believe tends to backfire so you shouldn't do that. You can exploit those retards for profit but you should never get high on what you sell to them.

Your mistake is thinking that there's any money "in the system". There's none. There never was any. All money that current bagholders paid for their bags went to other people and is in their pockets, not "in the system" somehow.
So your observation that no money actually left the system despite the market fluctuations doesn't mean that your "investment" is still in there somehow, undiminished.
It means that it was not an actual investment, actual investments result in illiquid assets you have to your name, illiquidity isn't the same as zero value, it's the opposite because only illiquid assets (such as furnaces, factories, pizza ovens) can produce value.
And your investment attained its zero value the moment you sold your USD to an earlier bagholder who used them to buy a ferrari. From then on it was all about whether you could pass your zero-value tokens to the next generation of bagholders with profit.

No, that's exactly what fractional reserve banking is.


$100 is a deposit liability. With the reserve ratio of 10% the bank is required to hold $10 in the vault and can invest/loan $90.
Quote Wikipedia or other reputable source or explain in your own words what do you think fractional reserve banking is.

No, I don't.


I stumbled here accidentally and shared my opinion on how things are.
Now you tell me why do you want a subreddit that unquestioningly supports Bitcoin no matter what the truth is?

No. The worth of a pizza is that it can feed a man for a day. The worth of a pizza oven is that it can produce twenty or thirty pizzas per day. The worth of my investment into a local pizzeria is that my saved and crystallized labor allowed them to buy a bunch of labor from oven-makers, in the form of an extra oven, and that oven produces extra pizzas, and at some point it pays back so that both me and the pizzeria end up with a bunch of extra money corresponding to all those extra pizzas in the world, that feed people.
Clueless people told you that fractional reserve banking is bad, because it creates money from the thin air. This is the exact opposite of how it all works. Fractional reserve banking means that for every $100 you deposit, instead of having them all rot in the vault, the bank loans out $90 to pizzerias that produce extra goods and pay back the loans, with profits split between themselves and the bank and you.
Fractional reserve banking does have a drawback that might make it seem that they are cheating, because if everyone tries to get their 4% per annum deposits back at once, the bank wouldn't have enough money on hand. Because the 90% of the deposits are in the illiquid assets, the loans to pizzerias, and further the extra ovens those pizzerias bought that are yet to pay for themselves.
But that's not a bug, that's a consequence of the fundamental property of the system, that's the only way you can expect your deposit to _possibly_ give you profit without cheating. It's still in the system, you still own a part of some pizzeria's oven and its future profits, you just can't liquidate it.
But as I said clueless people told you a very different tale about that, and then told you that the way you "invest" in bitcoin without any actual assets being assigned to your name is the same as what banks do, only without the evil and greedy bankers involved. So you can expect the same as from putting your money on a savings account, only better, because no bankers.
Now the reality is giving you an object lesson about trusting clueless people who tell you that you're so clever because you listen to them.

No, what you're talking about is that after someone took a loan and used it to pay for a service, the person they paid to can deposit that money again, so 90% of it can be loaned out again, and so on, as a result theoretically creating up to 10 times as much owed money for every dollar originally deposited.
This is absolutely not the same as what you described, and all those loans are actually backed by some pizza ovens and stuff in the real world.

Because the man pays us for the pizza, lol. And we value the money because then we can buy ice cream and clothes and shelter and also pizza for ourselves, and these are things we enjoy.
Assumption that most people not suddenly deciding that they are OK with suffering through starving to death is a teensy bit more solid reason for investing into a pizzeria than what you have for bitcoin.
