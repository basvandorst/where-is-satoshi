# Easy to become a member of the bitcoin foundation, you just pay lol
# Stay away from this ICO!!
 No smart contract, No github, Team with a fraudulent / scammy past, Dodgy company registered in the uk, uk company director is not in the white paper, no tokendesk team member in the uk company.....
**Gintaras Tamosiunas** is the CEO of what company? He is not a director of Token desk LTD.          
**Gintaras Tamosiunas** is only the CEO of a whitepaper!!           
**New article by one of the leading media of Lithuania:**          
          
              
**English Translation:**        
         
 Charity scammer:   
You have **Tomas Mickauskas**, a charity scammer in your team.




**Source:**           
                  
            
         
**Company house source:**
 Another crook in your team:?
A blog from 2011 talks about **Povilas Ruzgaila**, a team member of Tokendesk.


Scand jobs (Povilas Rozgailas and Arturas Maculevičius) and Vidmantas Laukaitis are scammers
**Source:** 
**Translation:** 
**The TokenDesk website says:**


Does that apply to your team?
Why did you ask an investor to transfer money to a spices company? That sounds like fraud. (see new article at the start of this post)
**Why is the new Director of Tokendesk LTD, Stuart Poppleton, a 77 years old, director/former director of over 300 companies in the UK.** Who is this guy?      Tokendesk Messiah?
It looks like the same Stuart Poppleton from this thread:
If you google and search for Stuart Poppleton (company house etc...), you will see that he usually becomes a director before a company shuts down. **That's what we call a director for hire**.


**Source:** 
This looks very strange........
Did you hire a random director to **avoid any liability** before you close shop?
**Not a single person mentioned in the TD whitepaper is a director of the UK company.** Can you please explain?           
                             
You also don't have a bank account but instead used 3rd parties such as paysera and revolut to accept fiat transfers. Those accounts are now frozen / shut down.       
            
Please stop this Joke ICO. Refund investors. Change career. Go home if you still have one or else go to the nearest shelter.
