This is impressive, thank you.

Simple. It's in order to avoid taxes. You convert the btc outside of your primary tax paying residence.

I appreciate the ethnic role reversal ... Smart, witty black female is mugged by good looking platinum blonde well built white male. It's part of the joke right?

Very true. Did you hear about the blue eyed male home invasions in South Africa? The blue eyed devils torture, rape and brutally murder poor white farmers. And apparently the same is happening in Detroit's affluent communities. Only more diversity can save us!

Damn fine letter.

Sure. Evade.

Thanks for the heads up. My biggest goal is to make 1/2 trades per day. Coinbase waits about a week for a trade to go through. I'd mostly be buying and selling and doing margin trading once I get comfortable.

Interesting. Is there a graph of the btc market cap over time?

Dogecoin's big thing was its liberal use of tipping in its subreddit which Bitcoin seems to have adopted. It's was almost it's primary organic use. Since Bitcoin started tipping Doge has had a slow 2 weeks.

In twenty years this will be referenced as the single largest donation in history and some fucker will dig up the reddit comments from the archives.
And people will hail my comment as being so prescient and then read all of my true to life comments and hail me as a prophet of my time and try to track me down.

Ghana, the capital of online fraud. Jesus, don't any if you watch Vice?

Does it? The knife kinda negates the muscle.
In my head I would expect an attractive athletic male to have more alternatives than a scrawny male. Unless he's doing it for pleasure in which case I'm ok with the race - % wise there are more white serial killers. We're arguing over minutiae. Let's not lose sight of the over compensatory politically correct choice of races.

I understand what you're saying and you're right about the fact that fiat currency changes hands and was probably at one point used in illegal activity.
My argument is that I'd like Bitcoin's success to be that of the good guys (read : early adopters, risk takers, people that believe in revolution) and knowing that even if the thieves stow away just 10%of their coins Bitcoins success will be their success.
It makes me cheer for bitcoin less. It's human nature. And I understand if you have skin in the game why my comments might be upsetting. Maybe it's just part of bitcoins maturing process... Like when your child starts swearing - it's inevitable and part of the game.

ITT speculators that don't want to admit Bitcoin has many similarities to a Ponzi scheme.

The worst thing about the scandal is knowing that 6% of the currency is potentially in the hands of thieves. I haven't entered bitcoin and am in the process of evaluating online currencies. It makes me think about waiting longer for someone famous or some state to back a currency where I can be an early adopter. I see how this won't destroy bitcoin, but I don't like thinking bandits prospered instead of early adopters.

Never heard of GIMP. Will check it out. TY.

Upvoted.  What software does one use to make comics like these?  I'd like to make some political comics, I just can't drive for shit
