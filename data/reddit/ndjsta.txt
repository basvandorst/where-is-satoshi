The merchants who accept credit card payments are under a lot of scrutiny and have accountability to Visa/MC etc.
The merchants themselves are highly unlikely to fraudulently charge your cards.
In any case the card companies are quick to reimburse fraud committed against you, making Credit card shopping in store and online actually quite safe.
However I see no reason companies can’t provide services that cover btc fraud with everyday spending and storage of your funds.

It’s not a return, you lose $10k...
There’s no benefit, it’s just reducing your salary by 10k.
And of course you don’t have have to pay tax on money you don’t earn. The only benefit of a tax deduction is if it’s used for stuff you would’ve bought/invested in regardless.

So let's say I create a wallet in breadwallet, then save the word seed.  I then go on to receive 15 payments, each into a different address. 
I then lose the phone, and want to recover my funds. So I install breadwallet on a new device, and use the word seed, how does it know how many addresses I had, and manage to rebuild all the private keys for those addresses?
Also, what if I was to use an offline script or program to load the word seed into, how could it possibly rebuild all 15 addresses I had with btc?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:14:06
So will it create the same 15 addresses in the same order? Or does it have to generate a tonne of key pairs and compare it to all addresses in the blockchain to get a match?
