If nothing else: roll way more dice than you think you need, run the results through SHA-256 (it almost doesn't matter how), and there ya go. The output will be as unpredictable as all the die rolls together, up to like 100 rolls or something (which would saturate SHA-256).
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:37:30
Many hash algorithms (including SHA-1 and SHA-256) have a running internal state the same size as the output. If a collision is found in this internal state, it can be can be "maintained" by adding identical data to both files afterwards.
So, if two files A and B are found such that SHA1(A) == SHA1(B), it is also true that SHA1(A||C) == SHA1(B||C).  (Most of the time, anyway. Padding can mess this up sometimes.)

It's not the amount transferred that matters, but the size the transaction takes up on the blockchain. Right now a decent fee would be around 1 mBTC per kilobyte. The smallest "normal" transaction is around 250 bytes, so you'd need 0.25 mBTC to make it go through quickly.
If your fee is 0.038 mBTC (I'm guessing the units), then unfortunately it may take a very long time to go through. There are ways to speed this up (transaction accelerators, child-pays-for-parent) but I don't have any experience with them myself.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:44:19
Nothing good can come of this.
- Even if BU gets &gt;50% of hash power, that doesn't mean all BU-supporting pools will sign up to attack the remaining "Core" blockchain.
- Even if they do, expending all your hash power to attack another currency leaves your own currency inoperable/vulnerable.
- In the event of a Bitcoin civil war, the most likely outcome is the destruction of both sides while the users flee to altcoins. These tend to have different PoW algorithms, rendering mining equipment useless.

Ironically, this is why we need Bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:32:58
Came here to say exactly this. 2^56 is nothing for a determined attacker. A 2-out-of-3 multisig setup or a split-knowledge scheme where *nothing* is gained without 2-out-of-3 are the way to go. (Though these are more difficult to pull off.)

Which online wallets are you talking about? A lot of them (e.g. the ones on exchanges) don't give you control over your keys, they're basically "IOU X bitcoins".
If you are in full control of the keys, that would take some specialized client software to make it work (otherwise how does the signing operation occur?), and leave you vulnerable to the keys being stolen if your machine were compromised. At that point, why not just use a local software wallet?
@_date: 2017-02-24 02:14:51
Definitely. If someone broke SHA-256, the ability to do that secretly would be worth a fortune. But once a collision is found, the data might be known by multiple people within the team, including disgruntled underpaid interns. All it takes is for one of them to anonymously submit the collision in order to grab some extra cash.
This gives us an early warning so we can harden Bitcoin (and the rest of the internet) appropriately. So we're basically putting up a bounty for people to rat out clandestine cryptanalysis and warn us of what's coming.

A few possibilities:
- It's a fake version of Electrum that steals your money or something. (Where'd you get the exe from?)
- Baidu has decided Electrum is malicious as part of the whole China Ban Bitcoin thing.
- It's a false positive for some other reason.
- Electrum itself has malicious code. This one's exceedingly unlikely, as Electrum is open-source and one of the more well-known Bitcoin wallets.
Unfortunately Windows systems tend to be more vulnerable to fake/trojan'd versions of software because they make it harder to compile stuff from source, and they don't really have a package manager. If you're doing Bitcoin on Windows, I'd suggest looking into a hardware wallet, or failing that, a multisig wallet with your desktop and phone or other device. (You can set it up so your desktop and phone/laptop/whatever are both needed to make a transaction. It's clunky, but much less likely to be stolen as the same party has to compromise both.)
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:30:26
If you need it to go through quickly, look into child-pays-for-parent.  (In short: take the unconfirmed change from the stuck transaction and spend it [probably just back to yourself] with a fee high enough to cover both transactions. You might need a fancy schmancy wallet to do so.)
@_date: 2017-02-27 05:33:21
Fourth-dimensional arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:22:07
Nope.  Breaking Bitcoin requires a preimage or second-preimage attack on SHA-256; this is much more difficult than a collision attack.
Edit:  Bitcoin's ECDSA signatures use SHA-256, so a collision attack can be used but only in a limited capacity.  The attack requires you to sign a transaction that looks like what you requested (e.g., from a compromised watch-only wallet) but is part of a collision.  After you sign it, the signature is also valid for a different transaction (the other part of the collision), allowing the attacker to double-spend your coins. The mitigation is to be careful when signing transactions which were generated by an untrusted entity; i.e. don't let the gap between "request transaction from possibly-compromised watch-only wallet" and "receive transaction and sign it" give the attacker enough time to find a collision.

54,000 new bitcoins are mined every 30 days, plus you get some extra for transaction fees. If you want to mine 1000 BTC per month, you'd need around 2% of the network's total hashing power.
However, in many parts of the world you'll *lose* money because the cost of electricity outweighs the reward.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:48:47
That's not the size of the transaction. 54.595=54.557+0.38, so this only makes sense if the input and output listed by OP are the amounts transferred, rather than the size in bytes.

Looks like a tracsaction fee of about 2 cents. That'll be in the queue for some time. If you're the recipient, maybe look into child-pays-for-parent, that will speed things up.
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:25:01
I think it's a continuum:
- "We accept Bitcoin directly or through a payment channel."  Seems fine.
- "We accept Bitcoin, but only through a payment channel."  A little sketchy.  (Why disallow on-chain payments unless there's some ulterior motive?)
- "We accept Bitcoin, but only through a particular payment channel which is centralized, capable of seizing funds, and heavily regulated by the US government."  Sketchy to the point where it's disingenuous to compare it to other Bitcoin transaction methods.
From this, it seems that we need to scale sooner rather than later, including the implementation of trustless second-layer systems. Otherwise we might start using centralized payment channels and end up right back where we started...
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:57:30
Makes sense that contemporary cryptography will eventually get broken. Bitcoin's weakest spot cryptographically is probably ECDSA. We should probably fork to another signature algorithm sometime between 2020 and 2030.
@_date: 2017-02-01 20:52:41
I was thinking along the lines of a few purchases per week, instead of a single lump purchase. It helps to prevent huge losses if you're buying while in a bubble, since the bubble will typically pop before you're done buying.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:35:38
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:39:42
How many inputs/outputs does the transaction have?  That can really increase the fee if it takes up a lot of room on the blockchain.
(Also yeah, we've got some congestion issues to work out...)
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:16:22
The amount being transferred doesn't matter, instead it's the size the transaction takes up. Your transaction is about 15 times the size of a "typical" transaction (3768 bytes instead of ~250), which makes the fee higher.
But yeah, this is a problem. We've only started hitting the 1MB limit semi-recently, so hopefully a solution will be found soon (either a straightforward way to reduce the size of this type of transaction, or bigger blocks, or something else entirely).
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:02:44




Baaad combination.
Also, if you want to invest in something as volatile as Bitcoin, it's safer to do it slowly with smaller purchases, instead of a lump buy. This can reduce your losses if things go crashy crashy (which tends to happen once in a while, even if the overall trend is upwards).
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:20:45
It's correct that the collision needs to be early-on for it to be stuffed into a spend-from-P2SH transaction. However, I'd say it's pretty normal for that to happen. Demonstration collisions are usually performed on small messages, for one reason or another (maybe because they're more portable). As an example take a look at [this]( MD5 collision.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:18:59
It's not the hash, it's the asymmetric cryptography. We need a quantum-cryptanalysis-proof signature algorithm to replace ECDSA. There are a few in the works, but not ready yet.

Pyramid schemes eventually fall apart because everyone buys and there's no one left to sell to.  However, if that happens with Bitcoin, it will have successfully become a dominant currency, and as such it will still have value.

What wallet software was the seed originally created/used with? Electrum doesn't use BIP39. (Different wallets can interpret seeds differently, unfortunately.)
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:42:51
I guess it comes down to risk of losing your keys vs risk of having them stolen. Online wallets manage your keys for you which makes them harder to lose. The trade-off is the possibility that the server gets hacked, or the wallet company decides to defraud you.
Note that hardware wallets can often be backed up by memorizing a seed phrase or similar. This provides protection in case the wallet is lost or breaks.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:50:41
This is true. SHA-256 collisions will show up long before SHA-256 preimages (which is what's really needed to attack the blockchain). Unless there's a huge break we should have plenty of time to react.
@_date: 2017-02-23 19:33:46
It probably won't be enough money to actually motivate someone to break SHA-256 (that would be a *big* bounty), but it might be enough that someone who secretly broke SHA-256 would be tempted to claim it, thereby revealing the break.
@_date: 2017-03-09 07:27:53
Non-segwit miners and nodes will not reject a block because it steals segwit funds. (Because they can't tell the difference between legitimate segwit spending and segwit stealing.) The only way to keep them on the same chain as segwit miners &amp; nodes is to ensure segwit miners have majority hash power.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:49:23
A 51% attack isn't theft, but it's still the intentional destruction of a financial system. That's like the difference between robbing a bank and burning the bank down.

Huh, I'll admit I hadn't thought through what bridging nodes could do. Interesting...
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:10:15
Here's the issue: in all cases, somewhere there is a machine that knows your keys and signs transactions with them. Either it's your personal machine, a hardware wallet, or a server somewhere. It needs some sort of internet connection, otherwise it can't send its transactions to the network. Compromise of that machine compromises your keys.
This makes people uncomfortable, as internet-connected machines tend to have large attack surfaces. Hardware wallets get around the issue by holding the keys but only having an indirect "connection" to the internet. They go through your personal machine, which provides transactions to sign and then broadcasts the resulting signed transactions. This limits the attack surface.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:14:57
It's also nice and stable at around $4. Good for riding out the forkpocalypse, in my opinion.

This won't work. If you reject BU blocks, they'll just find another way to signal BU that the rejection algorithm doesn't recognize.
And they're not really attacking the network. If they create larger blocks, the majority of nodes, exchanges, vendors, etc will just reject them. Instead, they're basically trying to *leave* the network and create an altcoin in a convoluted manner. Which will cause a very annoying loss in network throughput until the difficulty re-adjusts, but that's it. (Who knows, their altcoin might become more popular and be known as the "true" Bitcoin, but that's a battle of one cryptocurrency vs another rather than an actual attack on the Bitcoin protocol.)
The only long-term threat is if they try to launch a 51% attack or something. *That* would make things very messy, but they don't seem to have much intention of doing it. (People have talked about it here and there, but an effective attack would already be evident in the BU code, since they'd need to do merged mining or something fancy.)
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:17:03
They're not ready. Most merchants use Coinbase to accept Bitcoin payments, and Coinbase doesn't seem intent on migrating to BU. (It's possible [they'd list it as an altcoin]( instead.) Merchants that handle Bitcoin themselves tend to use Core nodes. The average wallet connects to a Core node &gt;90% of the time.
This is why successful hard forks are so tough. They require majority hash rate *and* all of the users to upgrade their nodes &amp; other software. Even if everyone wanted to switch to BU, the software upgrading would take months and require a fair amount of collaboration/planning.
@_date: 2017-02-25 21:14:21
Yup. Electrum uses something other than BIP39, but if Electrum closes shop there are still various ways to recover the wallet using its open-source code.
Easiest is probably to find some version on the internet somewhere, recover the wallet, and sweep the keys into another wallet; but you'd have to do the recovery/sweep offline in case the version of electrum has been trojan'd or something.
Edit: grammar and stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:05:57
Which pools compose the 51%? Jihan Wu has a lot of hashing power, but I don't think it's the majority.
Also, there doesn't seem to be an actual attack going on. Just an attempt at a contentious fork. Which may be a problem, but it's not the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:19:37
This is dangerous. Miners will signal for segwit but not implement it. Once segwit activates the chain will split.
Any fork without miner majority will always split the chain. Sometimes that's necessary, but it can't be avoided.

That's got little to do with it. Taking full advantage of segwit requires sending your money to a new segwit address. Which many people won't do for a while.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:59:09
If someone did that we'd already have problems. They could make demands and threaten to crash the market they weren't met. Also, there were only 2-3 million bitcoins in 2010 so they'd be inflated out of majority stake by now anyway.
Even if someone gained a majority stake after the inflation slowed down, their own incentive would be to do whatever gives the asset the most value, seeing how they own so much of it. Contrast that with a centralized miner that's only looking for short-term gains.
On a totally unrelated note: some proof-of-stake characteristics could be added to proof-of-work voting if new coins were unspendable for longer, e.g. 10,000 blocks instead of 100 blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:33:38
Well that's not good.
Solution: ensure all 0.13+ nodes form a cohesive network on their own, such that 0.12 nodes never act as the only bridge between two parts of the network.

@_date: 2017-03-17 18:48:04
The "Core" chain would only operate at 30% capacity, and process a new block once every ~33 minutes, until difficulty readjusted. Readjustments happen every 2016 blocks, which would take about 6-7 weeks if the fork happened right after the previous readjustment.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:04:02
Not the same thing. Miners are too interested in short-term gains. The best solution would be proof of long-term stake (e.g. address locked for months), but that would be impractical.
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:54:30
We need a POW algorithm optimized for personal computers. That way no one needs to go out and buy mining hardware because everyone already has it. You could still try to centralize but it would be much more expensive.
@_date: 2017-03-04 03:23:40
But if someone goes ahead and mines a block with anyonecanspend (e.g. a miner trying to steal money), the nodes will accept it. That's what allows segwit to be a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:37:37
Because the implementation requirements are very different. A soft fork is much easier to pull off than a hard fork, and will not split the chain unless something goes very wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-09 06:55:02
Regardless of whether it's stealing or not, a single anonymous miner could split the chain, which makes things very fragile. For this reason a minority soft fork will always create two chains, unless it becomes a majority soft fork before a malicious miner has the time to create a chain-splitting block.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:43:05
Unfortunately, this doesn't work for a couple reasons:
- When you give someone your private key, you still have a copy. The recipient doesn't have any guarantee that you won't spend the funds yourself, or give the same private key to others.
- For an HD wallet, giving up a single private key *might* allow an attacker to determine other private keys if they have other information (e.g., the Master Public Key). But I don't have any idea if this is actually possible; an expert on BIP032 would have to weigh in on that.

Well, crap. That only has a fee of 0.192 mBTC. My bad, I should've clarified that it needs to be 1mBTC *total*, not 1mBTC/kB.
The best solution might be to just wait this one out. Eventually (after a couple more days) the transactions will either go through or get kicked from the mempool, in which case you can start over from the beginning.

@_date: 2017-03-07 23:06:28
Yup, that's it. Send it to another address you own, and make sure the fee is high enough to cover all three transactions. I'd suggest a fee of at least 1mBTC. That comes out to ~150 sat/byte (all three fees across all three transactions), which should confirm in a reasonable time.

@_date: 2017-03-25 17:32:06
For anyone who hasn't upgraded, that *is* the main chain.
BU and UASF are blocked by the same thing: inertia. They require users to upgrade their software to work, and leave non-upgraded users on a different chain. At present time, the only upgrade scheme that brings along non-upgraded users is a miner-majority soft fork. Which is very limiting, but that's just the situation we're stuck with at present time.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:10:43
You can only replay-attack something if it's in Chain A but not Chain B. The replay pushes it unto Chain B as well.
In your scenario, everything is already in the main Bitcoin chain. You can use replays to mess with your own chain, but that's it.
On the other hand, if you convinced people to sign transactions specifically for your own chain, *then* you could replay those transactions on the main chain.

Hashrate is a lagging indicator of currency value. Right now there is no difference between running Core or BU, the block reward is the same. After the split, miners will migrate until the hashrates are roughly proportional to the value of the block rewards.

Do you have any unconfirmed change? If so, send it to yourself with a really high fee (like 400+ sat/byte) and it should make both transactions clear.
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:53:28
Bitcoin does seem to be migrating to "store of value" status due to the higher fees. It's still being used for lots of transactions (after all, the blocks are full) but it's only economical for larger ones. A $1 fee is terrible for buying coffee, but it's a bargain if you're sending $1000+ to the other side of the world.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:09:09

@_date: 2017-03-17 19:52:29
You could probably push it through with 50 sat/byte, either by waiting for it to be booted from the mempool or by CPFP. It'll take forever (a day or two?) to be confirmed and cost you a pretty penny (like 40mBTC) but it's way cheaper than that ripoff accelerator.

Yup. The default for timeout is 72 hours, but sometimes they can stick around longer.
Note that it *is* possible for a malicious recipient to rebroadcast a transaction after it expires, but if you're re-spending the same coins (which is probably the case since it sounds like you're emptying out your wallet) then it shouldn't be a concern.

Bitcoin uses a RIPEMD160(SHA256()) construct, which is much stronger than SHA-1 or RIPEMD160 by itself. The wide pipe nature of this makes it harder to exploit vulnerabilities.
Plus, Bitcoin hashing use cases typically are not vulnerable to collisions so an attacker would need to find a preimage (or second-preimage). This is expected to take 2^160 operarions while the SHA-1 collision only took 2^64 .
Edit: Don't get me wrong, I think segwit is a good idea, but this isn't why we need it.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:21:59
It depends on what the miners actually *do* with their majority hashpower. If they enforce a new rule that is useful, it's a soft fork. If they mine empty blocks, freeze certain addresses, etc., it's a 51% attack. The border between the two is somewhat subjective.

Check out the full price history if you haven't already. This thing tends to happen where the price rapidly jumps to 1000-2000% and then rapidly drops to 20% of that. Overall it's a net increase, just don't buy at the wrong time...

@_date: 2017-01-24 08:18:15
Unfortunately I can't give you an answer, but here are my thoughts on the matter:
1. The transaction takes up 814 bytes, with a fee of 53,170 Satoshis; so about 65 Satoshis per byte. Looking at [this graph]( the "threshold" for a quick transaction seems to be about 70-80 Sats/byte. This is something of a recent increase, which explains why the issue has been popping up lately. (i.e., wallets auto-generate fees but aren't keeping up with the increase.)
2. There is such a thing as a "replaceable" transaction that allows you to increase the fee later. Sounds like that isn't the case here, but it is still possible to push it through, basically by doing a double-spend. Unfortunately that's tricky to do and is something of a last resort.
3. Your best option may be to wait this one out. Eventually a miner should pick up your transaction, and then off you go (estimated wait time seems to be 20 minutes to 5 hours). But this depends on how patient the seller is, I suppose.

The blockchain is synced using a more powerful machine (desktop or decent laptop) and then transferred to the pi.

She wasn't entirely wrong: it allows transactions without a central authority.
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:13:27
The longest chain *which the majority of nodes accept as valid* is consensus.
As an example: I could mine 20 blocks on my laptop in a few minutes using an invalid/broken proof-of-work scheme, and run a few custom-built nodes that accept and forward it. That would be "the longest chain on the network", but all other nodes would reject it and blacklist mine. Therefore, no one could reasonably consider my longer chain as consensus, even though a few nodes accepted it. It's just a failed hard fork attempt.
@_date: 2017-01-30 06:24:26
It really depends on which way the exchanges and clients go. If everyone switches to BU at the same time, then the longer BU chain is considered valid and BU *is* the new Bitcoin. (The original would become an altcoin similar to ETC.) However, if there's any major disagreement (e.g., Coinbase stays with Core but Gemini goes to BU) then things get messy fast; chances are both versions would plummet in price.

@_date: 2017-01-30 06:36:07
Right now, "BU with &gt;1MB blocks" and "Core with SegWit transactions" are both altcoins, in a sense. The "true" Bitcoin is the one with majority consensus, and currently we're stuck with boring old 1MB. Moving in either direction requires a super-majority to really be safe.
Personally, I'd like to see a hard fork that contains both SegWit and a dynamically increasing block size. But that doesn't seem too likely at the moment...

I've had a good experience with Electrum so far.  (However their mobile app isn't as good as the desktop version.)
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:37:24
If BU had more than 50% of the network and this happened, you'd wind up with two chains: the shorter Core chain with all blocks &lt;1MB, and the longer BU chain with at least one blcok &gt;1MB. These separate chains will never reconcile, and will disagree on the values at certain addresses. This effectively creates an altcoin, with the added hazard that lightweight clients will sometimes connect to a Core node and sometimes to a BU node.

That guy may know things we don't, but the idea that intelligence agencies can break *everything* is almost certainly BS.  For example, AES has been analyzed by many independent groups for years, and very little headway has been made. Are we to think that NSA, GHCQ, etc. has managed to completely break it when no one else can make it crack even a little?
NSA can break plenty of things, but they're usually exploiting mis-configured systems and protocol flaws, as well as weaker algorithms, such as DH-1024, RSA-768, RC4, and so on. So far, Bitcoin doesn't seem to have any of these issues.
Bitcoin could be broken if there's a break in SHA-256 or ECDSA secp256k1, or a *serious* break in RIPEMD-160.  There don't appear to be attacks on any of these yet.  (And even if hash collisions are found we'd probably be safe; you'd need a preimage or second-preimage attack to really do any damage.)
The weakest link here is probably ECDSA, which could be broken with quantum cryptanalysis.  NIST is advising the cryptographic community to migrate to quantum-cryptanalysis-resistant algorithms in the near future, so it may make sense for Bitcoin to transition to a different signature algorithm at some point.  But somewhat ironically, this recommendation serves as evidence that we're safe for the time being: if the NSA had a secret quantum computer that could break ECDSA, they'd want everyone to keep using it for as long as possible.
There's also the remote-but-nonzero possibility NSA put a back door in secp256k1. That could be solved by switching to an alternative such as Ed25519.
In a nutshell, yes it's a possibility, but it's a very remote one. NSA may have been able to break everything once upon a time, but that's not the case anymore.

They *are* gone in the sense that they can never be used again. Most lost bitcoin can only be recovered by pre-imaging SHA-256, and if that ever becomes possible, Bitcoin in its current form is probably hosed anyway. (Along with most of the internet.)

Yeah, admittedly I'm late to the party. But the price is more stable than in 2014, Bitcoin is easier to get now, and it's been semi-legitimized by many governments.
But no, this stuff won't all happen automatically. We have to make it happen, otherwise people like me will keep posting excited stuff and nothing will ever change. We can't *just* hodl, we have to grow the Bitcoin economy as well.
Edit: it's also not too difficult for a holder like me to make purchases. I can hoard most of my deflationary currency, spend a little bit, and increase my DCA contribution slightly to compensate for the spending.
@_date: 2017-01-24 18:47:22


I agree that on-chain transactions are not suitable for small purchases, but there are more important things than black markets and day trading. (Besides, it's a fee market -- whoever pays the largest transaction fee generally goes first, regardless of what they're doing.)
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:25:00
It's a one-way function which Bitcoin uses (along with a few other things) to generate addresses from keys. It's also used to sign transactions. If you could somehow break it, you could break Bitcoin, impersonate secure web pages, and do all sorts of other shenanigans.
@_date: 2017-01-31 20:23:19
Lots of wallets let you import or watch an address. There are also online tools, such as [bitref](
(Also, for questions like this, Google is your friend. I found bitref just now by searching for "bitcoin get value of address" and clicking on the first result.)
@_date: 2017-01-10 09:25:04
Aside from privacy, sending from an address only once provides some defense against ECDSA vulnerabilities:
1. Nonce reuse.  In addition to the message, each ECDSA sign operation requires a "nonce" input, which must never be reused -- otherwise you expose your private key.  There are plenty of ways to reduce/eliminate this possibility, e.g. using a strong random number generator.  But the safest bet is to just use the private key once.
2. Side channel attacks.  ECDSA is particularly vulnerable to things like timing attacks and power analysis.  With the right tools, someone with limited access to your system could potentially recover your private key that way.  One possible defense is to render the private key useless after signing by  never sending it any money again.
Note that (in my opinion) neither of these are serious issues for the everyday Bitcoin user.  The "use the key once" is just an extra layer of caution in case someone's actively attacking you.

I think you've got Bitcoin all wrong here.


It is *now*, but it won't be once more and more people use Bitcoin... which will only happen if people can buy things with Bitcoin, which will only happen if we reward vendors for accepting Bitcoin. Someone's gotta jump-start the process, and it's much easier for long-term holders since we're already on the exchanges. Eventually people will have the option to get paid in Bitcoin (and I mean directly, not just via bitwage) and exchanges will be a much smaller part of the system.


That's true, but I think it's an acceptable sacrifice for push-only money. (Remember, this also means banks and governments can't drain your accounts on a whim like they can with fiat.) Not a huge advantage when most of your money's in fiat (I love Bitcoin but I'm not putting in more than I'm willing to lose) but think long-term here. Edit: multi-sig escrow can also help deal with this problem.




Credit cards *do* have fees and delays, but they're handled by the merchant, so they're invisible to the customer. Off-chain transfers (once we really get them going...) are more convenient at the cost of security, which is fine for small purchases where you're physically present. Someday Lightning networks could be used to pay for things like gas and coffee, while on-chain transactions would only be used for large payments and online orders. There's clearly lots of work to do, but the potential is huge.


It's true that spending Bitcoin is a lot like selling it: you're pushing more of it into the open which makes the price go down. However, there's this giant second-order effect: if you reward merchants for accepting Bitcoin, more merchants will start to accept Bitcoin. If Newegg and Overstock start to steal market share from Amazon because they take Bitcoin, Amazon will jump on the bandwagon. This makes the value of Bitcoin go up, but more importantly it makes it viable as an actual currency.


Bitcoin *is* a lot like digital gold currently, but that's an unsustainable transition phase. If it never takes off as a real means of payment, the primary utility is to buy with hopes of selling at a profit later... in which case we've got a pyramid scheme on our hands. Distributed artificial scarcity (Bitcoin) is better than centralized artificial scarcity (beanie babies), but it's not the same thing as actual natural scarcity (gold).
The whole reason for Bitcoin's existence, and the justification for its rapid increase in value, is revolution of the payment world. It's not ready yet, but it will be if enough people work towards it. If you believe (like me) that this crazy idea might actually work, my suggestion is to buy and hodl, use it for spending when possible, and evangelize it in general. If you don't think it'll work, the value will eventually go to zero so it might be safest to not get involved at all.

Core doesn't control Bitcoin, as much as they might like to. It's up to the miners to decide what to do. Right now we've got ~20% supporting SegWit, ~20% supporting BU, ~10% supporting 8MB blocks, and the other ~50% not supporting anything. As such, the protocol does not change.

It's not always cheap, but it's much easier to roll out from a technical perspective. No one really needs to upgrade except a majority of the miners. Everyone else can go about their business with pre-fork software and they'll be on the same chain as those with post-fork software.
This can sometimes be unethical as it's dragging along users who might not like the new rules of the soft fork. (You could say a soft fork is a "benevolent" 51% attack. It's good to make sure it's actually benevolent.) As such, it's important to get community support even though it's not needed from a technical perspective.
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:28:00
Stuff like this really needs escrow services.
Fiat: You pay the vendor at purchase. If the vendor defrauds you, you can do a chargeback.
Bitcoin w/o escrow: You pay the vendor at purchase. If the vendor defrauds you, you're SOL.
Bitcoin with escrow: You put money into escrow at purchase. Once the vendor has fully delivered (the product is in your hands and non-defective, you've arrived at your hotel and they actually have a room for you, etc), you release the escrow. If the vendor defrauds you, the escrow service can return your money.
The existing fiat system only uses escrows when there's a high chance of fraud (e.g., large purchase on ebay). Bitcoin should probably use escrow for *any* large purchase, since there's no built-in fraud protection otherwise.
Edit: Bitcoin's volatility is a problem here, though. Vendors usually want to convert to fiat ASAP (or have Coinbase do it for them), and an escrow service would get in the way of that. Hopefully that becomes less of a problem as time goes on...

Those words create a master secret. The master secret is used to generate keys, or more specifically, public and private key pairs. Money is sent to the public keys (or "addresses" derived from the public keys), and can then be spent using the private keys. These transactions are tracked on the blockchain, which is public.
Anyone can peruse through the blockchain to determine how much money is at any given address, but you can't spend the money without the private key. The ~12 word seed lets you re-derive the same keys each time you use it, giving you access to whatever money the blockchain says is at those keys' addresses.
Edit: or something like that. I don't know exactly how it works.

@_date: 2017-01-30 20:16:52
My mistake, I think I get what you're saying now.
Correct me if I'm wrong here: BU nodes will always accept the chain that (a) meets their protocol and (b) has the most proof-of-work. They may occasionally follow a chain which Core does not recognize, but will always return to a Core-recognized chain because Core presently has more hashing power. If BU gains more hashing power than Core it may permanently fork off, but at that point BU *is* consensus because it is now the majority player in the network.
I can see that as BU following consensus. However, there are a couple problems:
- As BU gains hashing power (up to the 35-45% range), orphaned BU chains will get longer and longer. As such, the quality of consensus tracking will degrade.
- This system could cause BU to hard fork at 50-55% hashing power, which would be damaging to the currency. It's much safer to signal-only until you're at 90% or so, *then* depart from the previous consensus.

If you purchase any BTC with uncleared funds (even if most funds have been cleared) they hold *all* of your BTC as collateral until enough clears for you with withdraw all of it. If you want to withdraw some of your BTC anyway, here's a potential workaround (disclamer, not guaranteed to be perfect, yadda yadda yadda):
1. Sell enough BTC to remove the hold.
2. Withdraw the remaining BTC.
3. Repurchase the BTC you sold in step 1.

In general I agree (hence why I'm involved in Bitcoin in the first place), but I think governments should take steps to prevent fraud. And zero-fee trading with tons of leverage can lead to exchanges doing sketchy/fraudulent things in the background. (They'll trade against you but retroactively "cancel" the trade if it turns out not to be in their favor a few days later, embezzle their reserves, run a ponzi scheme in the background, etc.)

I'm in a similar situation -- I got involved about a month ago, and I've invested close to $7000 so far. Bought during the bubble like an idiot and everything.
But I'm okay with the way things are going. I'm in this for the long haul, and I know there will be plenty of bumps along the way. To be honest, I care more about the potential applications than the price (though it would be nice if it was more stable).
But that being said, I'm in a situation where I can afford to lose $7000. (I wouldn't *like* it of course, I'm not made of money, but I wouldn't be bankrupt or anything.) That's the real key: with something as volatile as Bitcoin, don't invest more than you're willing to lose. (Plus I was able to average down each time it dropped, because I started with a relatively small amount.)
Maybe a veteran Bitcoiner can weigh on this, but I suspect it's always been this way. The price has always been volatile, crazy stuff has always been going on, countries have always been banning Bitcoin, and the community has always (after Satoshi left, anyway) been on the brink of civil war. That's inevitable with new technology sometimes, especially when the ecosystem is deliberately a cooperative anarchy. (And in a broad sense, things seem to have leveled out in a lot of ways. Look at the full price history on a log plot, it's a lot more stable than it used to be.)
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:27:39
Here's the problem: every on-chain transaction needs to be retained on every full node, forever. So it's important to not let the blockchain get too cluttered.
I agree that we should move to bigger blocks at some point, but there are pros and cons to doing that. And then we'll figure out how to securely run "partial nodes" that use verified chainstates and recent blocks instead of the entire blockchain, and make other improvements that further allow block size increases while conserving node resources. But we shouldn't just jump to huge blocks all at once.
@_date: 2017-01-30 18:42:11


This is likely OP's point: if BU accepts blocks that the rest of the network doesn't, then it isn't tracking consensus.

Believe me, I know.  That's why they can (probably) break DH-1024 which is usually considered unbreakable.  But at the time being, the algorithms used by Bitcoin are secure by a pretty large margin.  Intelligence agencies would need to be 20 years ahead of the rest of the world to break secp256k1, and &gt;30 years ahead to break SHA-256.  There are some crazy smart people working for the NSA and GHCQ, but there are also some crazy smart people working for colleges and private corporations.  Group A might be ahead of Group B, but not by 20 years.
Then again, the authors of DES did know about differential cryptanalysis about 10 years before it was public knowledge.  Maybe we don't have enough margin after all... one solution would be to replace secp256k1 with Ed448-Goldilocks, and replace SHA-256 and RIPEME-160 with SHA-512 or SHA3-512.  Something along those lines would be a good thing to do next time there's a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-01-31 22:03:56
Bitcoin could be a good investment (I sure think so) but it's a high-risk one with a volatile price. As such:
1. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.
2. Don't buy in all at once. (I'd suggest dollar-cost averaging over a period of a month or more.)
3. Don't panic buy or panic sell.
4. Don't take advice from random strangers on the internet.

If you make the block size too small it basically forces people to use offchain solutions. A small increase would make things like LN more optional. The tricky part is to do it in a safe tested manner with user and miner consensus... and to not overdo it otherwise the blockchain gets bloated.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:47:29
You make a good point. Elastic block limits have the potential to effectively decrease the inflation schedule, which could reduce the hashrate.
One possible inflation-preserving method is to have the "given up" portion of the reward sequestered into a frozen account that unfreezes after a year or so. This would still discourage oversized blocks, but would also encourage miners of oversized blocks to be invested in Bitcoin's long-term viability. Another approach would be to forego the "soft limit + give up part of block reward" method for some ruberic which gives high-fee transactions less weight than low-fee transactions.


True, but it can't be *too* scarce. Total reward is fee rate x blocksize, so [big blocks x low fees] and [small blocks x high fees] are both sub-optimal. For maximum total fees per block, you want medium blocks and medium fee rates. It is possible to accomplish this with an elastic blocksize limit (where block size and fee rate both grow as the demand for block space grows), though you would need to tune it correctly.

In my opinion this sounds like a very good idea. "Normal" segwit's huge witness discount right off the bat won't help typical users but allows spammers to bloat the witness blocks. Phasing it in makes a lot more sense, and frees up some bandwidth for the 2MB increase.

Bad idea. PayPal is reversible while Bitcoin is not (hence why PayPal-for-Bitcoin is so rare). Look into other options.

The problem is, the cost to store a typical transaction on all (non-pruning) nodes for the foreseeable future is greater than five cents. Hence layer 2 and/or Litecoin. (If the LN gets implemented, Litecoin *will* be a layer 2 protocol for Bitcoin. Sorta.)

Unfortunately that's the way soft forks work, miner enforcement is the only real way to prevent a chain split. What we need to figure out is how to safely do a UA**H**F, and set up the new protocol to enable safe UAHFs in the future.

It's all important:
* Functionality &amp; security of the protocol
* Functionality &amp; security of the implementation(s)
* Network infrastructure
* Support from miners
* Support from users
If any one of these is lacking, things are not going to go well. Unfortunately most of them are difficult to quantify.

People need to start using the chickun testnet. It doesn't reset and it's getting segwit soon.

Cuz the disease is pretty darn bad. Bitcoin is extremely resistant to change, which has its advantages but means there's no truly safe way to do it. The only semi-safe options are a soft fork with overwhelming miner consensus (&gt;90%) and a bilateral hard fork with replay protection.
Soft forks are the safer option for now, but only to a point. *Truly* safe forking, which could not be damaged by false signalling or undone by miners changing their minds post-fork (or blocked by self-interested centralized miners, for that matter) would have to be some sort of advanced mechanism which we'd categorize today as a hard fork.
For now we use soft forks because they're the safest method we know. And they work just fine as long as miners represent the community at large. But with the current miner centralization that's looking less feasible, so it's good to start thinking about other options. UASF is an interesting idea, but it's much more dangerous than a miner-majority soft fork and possibly more dangerous than a typical hard fork.

Altcoin discussion is usually verboten, but Litecoin seems to get a free pass. Probably because it's meant as a companion to Bitcoin rather than a competitor, and because it's basically volunteering to be a guinea pig for segwit.

Obscuring the public key also protects the private key, unless you reveal the private key in some other manner. (Which Bitcoin doesn't do AFAIK.)
Bitcoin can work in a quantum computing world, but all current Bitcoin addresses would need to be strictly one-time use (among other things). Read [this]( for more.

I don't think ASICBOOST is *cheating* per se, but blocking segwit so you can do it... yeah, that's no bueno.

To short, you need to borrow from someone and sell. People can short the ETF, but the total amount of bitcoin purchased by the ETF can't go into the negatives... unless the ETF itself shorts bitcoin.

Seed length could be an issue here. If a determined attacker had half the seed they could potentially brute-force the other half. A typical 12-word seed contains 128 bits of entropy, give or take. That's too much to brute force, since it would take about 2^128 attempts. But half the seed only has 64 bits which takes much less time, at 2^64 attempts.
This is not a bad idea, but for it to work you would either need a 24-~~bit~~**word** seed (which you might already have) or better yet use multisig.

Unless they don't see it. After the fork, if a light wallet connects to nothing but Core nodes it'll see the 1MB chain. If it sees an S2X node it'll follow the 2MB chain.
As a result, the safest way to deal with the situation is to run both a Bitcoin Core node and a Bitcoin ABC node, in order to directly monitor both chains. (Or manually connect to nodes which you know for sure are Core or ABC.)
@_date: 2017-09-30 07:01:06
Running a full node ensures you're on the right chain. Otherwise you don't know for sure which chain you're on.

A hard fork *always* has the potential to create two chains. Post-fork blocks are incompatible with the original protocol, so S2X blocks won't be "seen" by Core nodes. As such, S1X blocks can be mined independently of S2X blocks, creating two separate chains.
If a hard fork has little or no contention, then yes, you wind up with only one chain. This is because everyone stops mining the old chain and migrates to the new one (e.g. Monero). However, if enough people want to keep the old chain alive, they can do so (e.g. Ethereum Classic).
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:52:55
A regular ol' blockchain does exactly that. Each new block contains a set of changes. The fact that you can't edit old blocks prevents the change-tracking from being subverted.
Even if you have a typo, the real fix is to append a block with some "oops, typo correction" change rather than go back and fix the original thing.

Your coins get forked along with the blockchain.
When a blockchain forks, there are two resulting versions. Each one has the same balances initially. As such, everyone will have coins on both sides of the fork.

To alleviate their BTC supply shortage, they'd need to buy from outside the country. But Localbitcoins isn't meant for international stuff. So no one can do arbitrage and the price shoots up.

Well it wasn't fees -- the fees for those are 0.000294 BTC each.

Segwit will likely *always* be optional, unless we do a hard fork to make all addresses use it.

Honestly, easiest way back then would've been to mine some.
Just be careful if you're planning to bring an ASIC with you -- that would probably break the difficulty settings and ruin everything.

It's definitely more subjective, especially since Bitcoin is decentralized and nobody owns the rights to the name. But there are a few ways of getting a good feel of which competing chain is the "real" one:
- PoW
  - Current hashrate
  - Cumulative work
- Value
  - Market cap
  - Trading volume
  - Preservation of emission schedule (otherwise market cap is unreliable indicator of value)
- Other
  - Popular recognition (by exchanges, wallets, etc.)
  - Legacy recognition (by older versions of protocol)
The chain tracked by Bitcoin Core wins out in all of the above, so I would argue it's unambiguously the "real" Bitcoin.
Also -- hard forks always have an uphill battle because they need to convince enough people to upgrade / switch over. Bitcoin Cash hasn't convinced enough people, hence its market value is lower.  It's possible for Bitcoin Cash to become the "real" Bitcoin (and current Bitcoin ==&gt; Legacy Bitcoin or whatever) but it would require the ecosystem to adopt it and prefer it over the current Bitcoin.
Edit: Figure it's worth mentioning: the above metrics are not meant to gauge which chain works better, in terms of functionality, security, etc. Instead these are measurements of which chain *people actually use*. I would argue that's the best determinant of where the Bitcoin name belongs.

This scenario is the other way around -- someone sends BCH to a BTC address. I could be mistaken, but I don't think a typical BCH wallet would refuse to send the transaction.

@_date: 2018-04-26 16:52:39
It is, and that's fine -- anyone can fork Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash does have quite a following. The problem is when they say "this is Bitcoin" and try to sell it as such, even when it's clearly a minority hard fork by any metric.
Kinda like how silver is a precious metal in its own right, but if you paint it yellow and say "this is gold" then people will start calling it "fake gold".

The only way to kill an idea is with a better idea. The internet killed fax machines; Bitcoin won't die unless something better comes along to replace it.

For a while, Bitcoin.com listed Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin, which is misleading. (The ticker was "Bitcoin (BCH)", next to "Bitcoin Core (BTC)")
The analogy is imperfect, but the idea is this: *Bitcoin Cash has value (i.e. it's not some worthless knockoff), but it is not Bitcoin. Labeling Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin is misleading.*
Edit: I can't spell cash apparently.

Bitcoin.com walked it back. For a couple days they listed "Bitcoin (BCH)" and "Bitcoin Core (BTC)".

Depending on metrics, Bitcoin Cash might be a better cryptocurrency than Bitcoin. But that doesn't mean it *is* Bitcoin unless the vast majority of people agree it is; that's a whole separate topic.

I was wondering that too. What if the price shoots up? Would people pay $300 to buy 0.14 BTC only to realize that's not enough when it doesn't work?
