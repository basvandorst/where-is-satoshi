That was only 8 weeks ago? I've lived a crypto-lifetime of ups and downs since then.

Positive, general news like this doesn't do shit for the market. Crypto is on such shaky ground rn that fb deciding to ban adds sends it into a bearish spiral. Weak hands.

This is a very weird post.

I don't worry about price at all. I see this as a 10-20 year play, not something to be too concerned about over the short term. I do wish I had not bought into B Cash tho, I went hard, bought at the exact peak and lost my ass. I fell for a lot of the BS that was happening at the time. Big lesson learned.

Here's another thing to think about. Millions may not mean anything if there's nothing to spend it on. I keep seeing this idea that the collapse of the US dollar will mean the rise of crypto. OK, let's stop to think about the kind of utter economic devestation that will come about if the dollar is to fail. There won't be supercars being made, let alone for sale. You may be desperate to stay alive, and even if you had an enormous amount of wealth, you'd either be a target with very little gov't protection to keep you safe or nothing lavish available to spend it on. You absolutely do not want BTC to rise as a result of massive economic failure. Look at other countries where this has happened or is happening now for and example of how tragic this is and what little some wealth means in these circumstances.

This is the dip. It's been in a year plus long dip. Still just over half its ATH.

Why would anyone use BTC for purchases when the price is so volatile? Nobody wants to be the guy who spend .5 BTC on a sofa when BTC was $10k only to have BTC worth $30k in 3 years. Right now, the thing that BTC is best at is to be used as a speculative investment. There are plenty of easy ways to purchase on eBay. I don't think BTC solves more problems than it poses for this utility.
That said, I'm all for it because adoption is going to lead to more purchases, which leads to more demand which leads to a healthier overall market as all other coins (except maybe ETH) are tied heavily to BTC.

I hadn't thought about that! That is an interesting way to frame it actually. I can see a bit more clearly from that perspective.
