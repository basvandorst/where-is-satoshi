This chart was created back when bitcoin was actually usable and not planning to be limited in it’s transaction capacity. 
We were hitting some very serious merchant adoption mid to end of 2017 as well, which no doubt would’ve skyrocketed, but that was all completely destroyed in two months because the protocol wasn’t properly scaled. 
So the bitcoin we’re dealing with today has absolutely nothing to do with the bitcoin everyone was rallying behind when this chart was made. 
And if you don’t think massively crippled merchant adoption hasn’t had an effect on the price, you’re crazy.

Welcome to Bitcoiners circa 2019, post-fork.  ����‍♂️����‍♂️
Everyone who cared about Bitcoin being usable as money was forced out to other projects and other subs by those who actually believe that an unusable Chuck E. Cheese token will increase in value for no reason.
And that excessive security and decentralization to the detriment of adoption is better than reasonable security and decentralization ALONG WITH adoption.

And you are a blind fanboy maximalist who can’t entertain any thoughts that don’t make you feel warm and fuzzy. 
I’d rather be me.
@_date: 2019-10-28 05:13:54
Why is it unselected? Because crazy maximalists might get mad at you? 
AT&amp;T has both BTC and BCH options on their checkout. Guess which one has no fees? Guess which one I use because of that? 
You’re going to have more purchases being paid in crypto if you offer BCH. Simply for the reason it became a thing in the first place:  It’s actually usable with low/no fees.

Dude.  Google the butterfly effect.  
With all due respect how can you be so out of touch with the world around you to not realize that even the smallest thing can have massive downstream effects? 
It’s amazing to me that people are so clueless sometimes.

Bitcoin is a currency dude. Not a house. And not a shiny fake digital rock.  It’s incredible that anyone has to remind a Bitcoiner of that.

You guys talk like this is a trait of bitcoin. That it “can’t“ do these things. Bitcoin was crippled by its developers. Unnecessarily crippled. 
In the fall of 2017, there was over 100,000 merchants both online and brick and mortar accepting it as a form of payment. 
I remember seeing articles from Tokyo where entire districts of restaurants and social establishments were seeing a massive uptick in BTC transactions for products and services. They were astonished at how well it was taking off.
And then BTC hit its transaction capacity because it wasn’t scaled by its developers. It completely clogged up, stopped working, and killed seven years of merchant adoption in a matter of two months.
That’s what happened. 
That’s why it isn’t 10 times bigger than it is today. That’s why it’s not ubiquitous as a payment system. 
Not because it has this as an inherent trait. But because those in charge decided that excessive security and decentralization to the detriment of adoption, was better than sufficient decentralization and security with widespread adoption.

You’re talking to technical minded people. They don’t understand sociology, group behaviors, psychology, or marketing. 
They don’t have the first clue. So all of them are shooting down your idea. 
If you’re a nerd out there and you think this is a stupid idea, maybe you should look into the butterfly effect. It’s a real thing. It happens all around you every day. 
Even an icon next to someone’s name can have a massive downstream effect. Every single tiny bit we can do to promote Bitcoin will help. 
Stop shooting down proactive ideas. Half of you sound like bankers that don’t want Bitcoin to succeed.

BitPay has singlehandedly done more to promote the use of Bitcoin as a currency than any company in this industry, in the history of this industry.

You guys are so cute. 
You all come here with no bitcoins and talk shit. 
Call everyone a cult. 
But every word out of your mouth reveals you just didn’t invest early enough because you didn’t have the brains to look into it, or the foresight to see its value.
So keep hanging out here being salty. 
While you think you’re mocking us we’re all chuckling at your the fact that you are poor.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:45:17
It’s so cute watching all of you former Nocoiners come in here and spread your misinformation and misery because you’re still biased against Cryptocurrency. 
We can’t really call you Nocoiners bc many of you  bought $10 worth of some shitcoin or 0.00000001 Bitcoin. 
But you’re still the same people who ignored Crypto for the last 10 years, and at the drop of a hat you will make snarky comments because you’re not heavily invested, or invested at all. 
Meanwhile Bitcoin ETH and BCH are piggybacked on worldwide merchant systems with over 100,000 brick and mortar and online merchants accepting them as payment. But why would you guys know about all that?

Stop saying nonsense.   BCH is simply another scaling approach for Bitcoin.  You’re blatantly lying by calling it “against” bitcoin.  
Some people actually believe Bitcoin was supposed to be used as a currency with low fees.  You’re entitled to prefer an unusable Bitcoin with ridiculous fees if you’re that kookoo.
And Coinbase has done more to further the adoption of your beloved coin than any other company in this entire industry.

Hey champ.   What’s it feel like making a statement when you know you don’t know what you’re talking about?
@_date: 2019-10-28 06:06:38


Please stop with this idiotic nonsense.  You people sound like delusional fanatics when you spout the narrative that high fees dont matter.  You also reflect that you know literally nothing about why Bitcoin was invented.  
Here’s a bit of common sense for you:  just because people continue to pay exorbitant fees for a period of time, doesn’t mean the fees are okay, nor that a single person is okay with paying them.

I love that this has become the narrative.  
Guess that’s what happens when two years goes by with people IN bitcoin telling people it’s not a currency.  Now we have to undo that narrative damage.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:30:31
Dude don’t act like you’ve been here since 2013. I can tell by the things you write that you haven’t. You’re brand new.
How can you have been here that long, and not know that the Halving is going to cause significant upward price movement as it gets priced in?
If you were here for the last one, you would know the price literally doubled / tripled from where we are at right now prior to the Halving. So you’re incorrect. We will see significant price increases in the next 4 to 6 months.
I do agree with you on the other part. The true massive bull run, possibly to $60,000 or higher, will be a year and a half after the having.

Bitcoin is a form of money that can make powerful humanitarian changes in the world. How can you not know that? 
Obviously some people are going to be passionate about it from a sociological perspective. Stop shooting down proactive ideas that are harmless.

That was such a dysfunctional response I can’t even figure out where to begin. 
The fact that a post like this makes you angry is completely fucking weird.  Very culty behavior. 
Why don’t you stop being such a paranoid fanboy and read what I wrote on its face? 
Nobody talks about the change BTC can make anymore.  Let’s discuss that, and why it’s happened.  Be an adult.  
Lol @ six weeks somehow being a sign of illegitimacy.  Idiot.  
As far as how long you’ve been here? I’ve been here since 2012. 
I said 2014 because I figured most people didn’t go back further than that because nobody here seems to give a shit about the social change Bitcoin was supposed to make anymore.

It’s incredible to me how many salty, pro-banking trolls there are on this sub now. It was never like this before. 
The 2017 bubble brought in a bunch of people who considered the whole Crypto thing a joke for 10 years. They wanted to make a little money off of it. Now they hang around here and promote pro-banking, pro-government, pro-regulation thinking. 
Every single thread is full of people talking shit about the Bitcoin narrative, and insulting Bitcoiners intelligence.
Why dont  you people go back to where you came from? This tech isn’t for you. You’re not cut out for this scene. You don’t have the capability to think in a new way. 
And you’re not going to stop this movement. So stop trying.
@_date: 2019-10-21 00:54:18
You are correct.
But in the 6 months prior, there was a gradual doubling in price leading up to the Halving, as it got priced in.  ($374 to $772)
We won’t be sitting at $8k till 2021. 
This pricing in will put us comfortably at $18k-ish by March 2020.  
A 50% dip after.  Nothing dramatic.  Maybe a drop to $14k. 
Then the long, wonderful, slow, upward slope to $60-80k over the next 18 months.

Yeah it’s pretty crazy that Zuckerberg understands Bitcoin more than most of the thought leaders in Bitcoin today. 
The Libra white paper literally reads like the Satoshi white paper. Peer to peer cash. Usable as a currency. If it’s not usable it has no value. Worldwide transfer of value. None of this BS flying around in the bitcoin world. Can’t believe what’s happened here.
That’s why so many conspiracy theories abound as to what’s happened to the leadership on this project. Having been here for many years, I never thought I would see the day when everybody prominent was telling people not to use Bitcoin. 
I mean if there’s a single narrative out there that the Banking system would want to push, that would be it.  Don’t use Bitcoin. Don’t disrupt our industry. Now they’ve got everyone in Bitcoin saying it? Absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2019-12-13 10:32:59


You literally have no idea what it takes to onboard hundreds of millions of people. Fees are literally the most important thing. Otherwise they’ll just keep using options that are cheaper. 
I wish all the nerds in this ecosystem would gtfo, and let the people that understand the real world take control of what’s going on with bitcoin. 
Also, BTC was intended to provide financial sovereignty to the 5 billion poorest in the world that cannot afford high fees. You out price them, you’ve destroyed the entire purpose of the innovation.

There’s a word for this and it isn’t “moderation“.
@_date: 2019-12-13 10:38:49
Well what do you expect when the people here spent three years telling everyone that it’s no longer peer to peer cash? 
And we spent six years building Merchant adoption and in one month it was completely destroyed because the developers didn’t want to scale? 
What’s left? Absolutely nothing. Usability is gone. Merchant adoption is gone. On boarding the 5 billion poorest in the world who can’t afford high fees: gone.  
What’s left? Lambos and Speculation.  That’s it. You guys don’t even see how this happened, do you?

Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer cash. That means me handing you a dollar, basically for free. 
And that’s how much it used to cost. Less than a penny. That’s when you bragged about transaction fees. This nonsense flying around now that Bitcoin is somehow only for moving huge sums of money, is wrong.  It’s just a product of the three years of misinformation that’s been propagated by those with an agenda here.
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:17:44
BTC only captures marketshare by offering something.  Usability.  
It won’t capture market share being a useless store of value that doesn’t even hold value.   
It captures market share by BEING USED AS A CURRENCY.

This post is nothing more than a propaganda piece to get everybody to stop thinking about Bitcoin as a disruptive worldwide Currency. 
Banks are terrified of Bitcoin, as a currency. They are not terrified of it as a Chuck E. Cheese token that you hoard and do nothing with.
That’s not disruptive to their industry, nor their control.  And they know it. 
Be wary of anybody who shows up here with a day old account, filling your brains with misinformation that Bitcoin is just a settlement layer you should hoard instead of use. 
It’s a currency. A peer to peer digital currency. Without usage, it has no purpose.  And if the BTC ticker no longer wants to be that, then it has become the alt coin.

Absolutely nothing. Except that they are a merchant processor and supported the fork that kept their business afloat while the BTC devs pushed for bitcoin to not be used as a currency anymore.  Any support of anything other than the approved narrative is subject to character assassination and boycotts around here.
