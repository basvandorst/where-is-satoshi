small steps development is best thing as you can do - you don't know how the network will behave even in small increase as the network is huge.
On your computer 1mb increase is very time, for the WHOLE network that may be bigger problem.
Let's do 2MB and see how it will work on and based on that let's implement BIP 101 or smth similar

story from last week or two. 
I run the reactjs react native development team 
I am in Poland
I received btc from san francisco with NO FEE and in 20minutes where our other clients send bank wires which usually takes 2-3 working days and $30-$50 in bank fees for international bank wires fees.
how about that men? 
the second thing is that I convinced the guy to use BTC instead a wire ( he was no btc user at all ).
you still dont see the btc unique selling proposition, men?

What does the "EQUITY ON OFFER 5%" mean at  ?
Is it an ICO or am I buying % of a company? Where the company is located?﻿

I used Gandi heavily in my past company when I was IT manager. They have very good user interface &amp; customer service. Great to hear that they are accepting BitCoin :-)

I am 27 years old, have marketable skills so my hedge to this risky approach is my young age and sellable knowledge. I plan to invest as much as possible into BTC in 2016 and then reconsider my strategy into less risky investment after 2017. How about you?

The same here 90% of my savings in BTC ;-) and another 10% in Physical Silver ;-)
Currently, I have less than USD $10 in FIAT :-)
