My understanding was that they could collect taxes, but I admit I haven't looked too far into this at the moment.

The government isn't going to shut down bitcoin. They couldn't even if they wanted to.

Nah. It's my own money from my military 401k. Bit of a gamble. Luckily I pull disability, so even if I lose most of it I'm still guaranteed income when I retire.

I'll do that. Thanks!

What's DCA?

I have 0 right now. But I'm expecting to get 45000 usd or so here in a week or two which I'm going to buy btc with.

Investing is always risky in any market where it's possible to make a 'lot' of money in a relatively short amount of time. I'm about to sink about 40,000 into bitcoin here in a week or two (as soon as I get it). The earlier you get in, the more you stand to make and the less you stand to lose in my opinion. If you're looking for a non-risky place to invest your money, there isn't one. All markets involve risk. 
And yes, crypto is legitimate. It's just a brand new thing and is still in its infancy. Get it now while it's cheap, or wait till later and get it when it's not cheap.

I'll have about 4 here in a few weeks as long as the price doesn't skyrocket.

I've been trying to buy more, but coinbase keeps telling me I have insufficient funds in my bank account. I don't have insufficient funds in my bank account.

Yep. Got some a month ago.
