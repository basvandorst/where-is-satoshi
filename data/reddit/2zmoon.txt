Nice to see new developments!

This is not so true, Dogecoin community is doing great deal to make Dogecoin more usable in many aspects besides marketing. like making 2 light clients. bring Doge to many exchanges, and I believe you will see it more into infrastructure as times goes by. Bitcoin is the started and it's more then 5 years old, Dogecoin is new, only exists for few months.

Some I believe lost money and they don't understand why, some probably think there is a bug in the bitcoin that lost their money...

I'm a doge fan, I think we are having fun while posting funny pictures and stuff like that, that sometimes only dog related then currency related. I believe that this fact it seems too happy :) is not related to developments, we always thank to the dedicated dogecoin developers &amp; I believe their software products are very high quality. I really wish dogecoin, bitcoin and other coins will go main stream. I'm actually very happy when I read positive bitcoin news about technology progress :)

I'm sorry to hear about all the ppl that lost coins cause of gox. I  don't know what to say, I just feel sad. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 21:50:04
I'm happy you got your BTC back :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:18:20
I think you should allow dogecoin payments as well as litecoin and bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:11:37
Oh thanks too! :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:12:32
luck for you, when was that?
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:57:33
Yes he will. PPR said dogecoin will sponsor this fan race and an extra one if josh will win the fan vote.

I think its a good sign, it means they are afraid, and publish to the world that bitcoin has benefits over credit cards.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:52:08
אחלה :) את זה באמת לא ציפיתי לראות!

If you write something, back it up with evidence.

the unlimited supply is limited, fixed amount of 5% per year, that will reduce in % over time. Its a benefit not a limitation, It makes people use the currency more and less keep it in their vaults. It also get new money to the system to recover the loss of lost wallets and lost passwords. and it helps keep miners alive which is the heart of the system.

that is this golden star?
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:53:56
There is no law like that, stop sending hate.
@_date: 2014-09-28 09:57:58
D is digibyte. dogecoin took from it difficult sync after each block...
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:15:35
I agree, I believe only the few most used coins will survive, probably bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin. there are many altcoins coming all the time but if the coin won't have strong community of people that believe in it, eventually it will fade out.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:29:31
coins are not destroyed, they switched hands.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:01:10
Oh thanks :) how do a claim the tip? or see how much I got?
@_date: 2019-03-21 03:16:08
Do you know people there, that are being paid in crypto currencies as payment for their job? Is this common or not yet?
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:09:39
At least you didn't buy a pizza for 5000 bitcoins..
