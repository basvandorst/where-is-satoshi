Just one desire to get rich is not enough, especially in conditions when bitcoin is a toy for large capitals, ordinary participants can not have a significant impact on the situation.
My advice to you. Invest in a more accessible market. Do not go far. IСO is an excellent option. Successful projects bring good profits, with small investments. I can recommend such a project Kelvin-blockchain.
The project will soon start, so there is still time to get familiar with it.

"To date, investing in the crypto currency is a risky business, despite the assurances of a huge number of experts, the situation is becoming more complicated, it is at the mercy of large players in the currency market. Today I would not take any chances.
 It is best to recommend investing in ICO, when you invest in such projects, you know that you will receive a product whose success will ensure a stable profit. It remains only to find such a project.
 From myself I can recommend Kelvin-blockchain. Multiple blockchains with different consensus algorithms, token types, and assignments will be available. The multichain technology allows creating almost an unlimited potential for speed and productivity. Kelvin Blockchain can launch up to 2^64 subchains - more available subchains will benefit in increased speed and security. Includes the post-quantum ring signatures for making the entirely anonymous transactions goal a modern day reality.This project has many advantages. 
Anyways, you`d better check by yourself and good luck with your and investments :)
