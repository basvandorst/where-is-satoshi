Stop watching the market and do other things with your life. Come back in 6 months or a year and you'll likely shit your pants.
You're okay. Just chill. It's only ~16% of your money. That's $1600/$10000 or $16k/100k. If you are that worried, pull out 15% and watch the 85% left grow over the coming months.
Also, consider diversifying into other promising coins. Don't always rely on BTC. Crap happens. It could go to a trillion or a couplle hundred. Be careful. I hope you can calm your mind about this tonight. I will be thinking of you.

Bank deposits with multiple vendors on LBC with low rates? 
Multiple mailings of cash and 3,000-5000 per shipment?
Credit union deposit?
Those are likely the only options with such a large sum of money. 
Possibly wire transfer to a btc vendor with a lot of coin in LBC or Paxful's escrow?

When he removed his email address, leaving only Gavin's on the bitcoin.org site. 
Also, when he stopped corresponding with Gavin when he said he was going to speak about blockchain to the CIA.
I still don't understand why he bugged out like he did at that moment-in-time, only to come back once and say Dorian wasn't him. I guess we don't even know if that was him or someone that compromised his identity.

You are correct! :)
Credit Card Fees and the Law. The first question that any business owner needs to consider before charging customers a fee to use their credit cards is whether or not it's legal. In 2013, the major credit card issuers ruled that merchants can add a surcharge of up to 4 percent to all purchases made via credit card.

They couldn't have messed with it or they'd have broken the hash-linked blocks before and youd have a whole other chain that wouldn't sync up with mainnet as your most recent blocks hash wouldn't be correct against the last one you got from someone else's data dir.
At any rate, got a node synced up using a computer that was a lot faster. Running LND on it already and working on getting LNDhub up and running so that I can link mine and my friends' bluewallet to it to eliminate the custodial portion of the app.

I think the Quantum problem is HIGHLY exaggerated. Like Andreas said in “Bitcoin is the next Bitcoin” - even if Bitcoin fails to some foe, someone will change the codebase to address the issue, distribute it and (if they are smart) call it BITCOIN, and it will absorb the market. I don’t think you can kill Bitcoin. Don’t think anybody will EVER kill Bitcoin. I don’t want to say it’s impossible, but I think it’s impossible. And I’ve been here since the slashdot article about the white paper in 2010....
@_date: 2019-08-08 19:21:02
You didn't answer my question. Why do I need to (re)index the blockchain that you have been running on your node? I don't need to trust you that you didn't screw with it, because if it syncs the latest blocks, the hashes are correct up to the current block I got from you, or else it wouldn't keep syncing after I spin up your data dir on MY machine. You following?
I'll check out your links, but would still like an answer to my question or for someone to point me to a DROPBOX/shared URL datadir or something to save me time. I can have the whole chain downloaded and running from someone who's already verified it on THEIR CPU, in under 12 hours. I'll still be waiting for MY CPU to verify 68% at that rate, and it's been running OVER a week already. I just want a data DIR that's already been indexed, or know how to SKIP indexing, and just take it for what it is as it's downloaded. I don't need to verify. I know it's correct by the fact it keeps syncing. There is no way to fool the prior hashes of the prior blocks to make sure the next block has the correct hash when checked against the last one.

A LOT of longs were liquidated on BitMex, so I’m sure this is correct. But the question remains “why did they get liquidated?” I’m standing by the Libra, Fed and 4BTC loss on Lightning Network being MAJOR contributing factors.

That growth on your money is going to be a little harder to achieve this time. 
Bitcoin is worth about what it should be right now. Not really less or more. 
It’s 6000x on your money to go from buying at $0.50 to selling at $3000. Now when the guys who buy the bottom (most recently @ ~$3,000) want to make the same exact 6000x on their money, they are going to have to wait until we are at $18 million to SELL AND ACHIEVE THAT. ����
I’m an optimist, but I don’t see us hitting that number for at least two decades, maybe longer. Would be a good gamble to put in 1/6000th of $5million as a possible inheritance to your children when $5million is a laughable amount of money (QE BABY!!) 
It ultimately depends on which side is manipulating the price and holding the biggest bag to tip the scales in their favor. Maybe one day Satoshi will come back, and do something super-philanthropic with his Bitcoin when the value hits $10million or maybe $100million. A billion per coin! Could you imagine? Satoshi’ s heirs could single-handedly change the world in the next century if the price goes to a billion per coin.
So put your money in, but be prepared to wait a VERY long time to see that kind of return again, and it’ll be followed by a roughly equivalent crash. Always is. Has been this way since 2010.
I don’t know the average yield Bitcoin has had, on average, since it’s inception, but I’m assuming that average is consistently and constantly getting lower, over months and years timeframes because the volatility has been very nominal compared to Mt Gox days and BitInstant and all the others that have been involved in HUGE runs over a few weeks or months. Only been a handful of them happen since bitcoin became worth something from Bitcoin Pizza Day. *source needed, it could have been an initial trade on Mt Gox or something. * ��‍♂️
Anywho, rambling now. Hope everyone that made it this far reading this has had some Happy Holidays, and are going to have a great New Year!

Serious question this raises: Why is it so bad to NOT verify and reindex the blockchain and just take a copy of someone else's? I'm missing the security implication. If the full node syncs up to 6 blocks into the chain past where I got it from you, I'm on the same network and chain, or it wouldn't have synced the 6 more blocks. What am I missing here? Why can't I find a copy of the INDEXED chain somewhere and just run my bitcoind with it?! 
Frustrations of someone who's chain got corrupted and is having to redownload and VERIFY the whole chain. Sad that on a 300mbps I'm still waiting WEEKS with this crappy computer I'm using to run bitcoind. Ugh! :(

Makes most sense for them to use the coins to manipulate the market back up by buying their coins lower than they sold them, then crash it down, lather rinse, repeat.

Best way to do it.
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:53:03
I have a feeling enforcement would be A LOT cheaper than one would think right off the bat from common sense... 
It's pretty easy for an attacker to have 100Gbit+ to other nodes with the fastest connections... those nodes controlled by said attacker could be using very powerful machines (maybe even quantum) and could get so many analytics off the blockchain so quickly. 
Pair those ALMOST INSTANTANEOUS analytics with Moneygram/Western Union/bank transactions and localbitcoins addresses sending amounts to addresses... you could find correlation of a $100 Western Union then ~$100 on the blockchain within 10 minutes of the WU transaction. 
Pair that information with surveillance at every location with a WU terminal, then they have positive facial recognition ammo against you that you ARE the person whom has done the wrong they say you have.
Man... technology makes super sleuthing so simple when you have access to ALL of the data.... simple and CHEAP, too, in the grand scheme of things. 
If you are REALLY trying to make an attacker pay an ENORMOUSLY large amount of money to trace your transaction... sending cash through the mail for MONERO, then bittrex'ing it into Bitcoin, while not being attached to your own IP, that would be the way to be completely untraceable from start to finish. I am not sure how ANY blockchain analysis now (or in the future) would trace that unless you broke your anonymity SPENDING the coins you obtain. (cross address contamination when using coins from multiple address inputs)
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:50:51
"The point of the tech" never was to keep ALL tx on-chain. It's to keep all records that need to be INSTANTLY verified on-chain. With Lightning, that puts the burden of proof on the immutability of a signed bitcoin tx. To say that Lightning was not part of Satoshi's vision, is short-sighted.
I read the whitepaper in 2010 (around block 65k), and have kept up with ALL developments in the space from Litecoin being invented by Charlie, DarkCoin came onto the scene, Monero came onto the scene. I remember Vitalik when Ethereum was only in his mind, and not the most used blockchain in existence. I remember Charlie Shrem's BitInstant and Mt Gox before it showed any signs it was going to crash I know what the people were buzzing about back in 2011 and it was MICROPAYMENTS on Bitcoin. That was the buzz about Bitcoin. You can't get your account frozen. You can send money to anybody without an intermediary. and can you guess it? YOU CAN SEND TRANSACTIONS FOR ALMOST FREE. 
We have since found out that for everyone to send payments at a reasonable rate, and literally INSTANTLY, it took fixing transaction immutability and creating a layer where the transactions that were signed, and redeemable for BTC if the new holder chooses, was the best way to do things. Also, increasing the blocksize like 4x (to 6x, depends who you talk to) was a great thing. Bitcoin is growing. 
This thing, Bitcoin, is going to be THE crypto. It will have complimentary "silvers" "coppers" and "bronzes", but I think Bitcoin is Gold, and will continue to be, maybe forever. :) I wouldn't put it past the most immutable, antifragile, secure, powerful Blockchain in the known universe. 
It will only learn from attacks and become more resilient against them. Even this recent dump of 40k BTC on the market, is only weakening the "adversary" that holds so much power to manipulate the market. 
Bitcoin and Blockchain is genius, and Satoshi, I hope lives on forever and ever as the proprietor of this WONDERFUL tech.

Buy when the 1D and 1W candles are REDDDDDDD! Then you aren't possibly EVER going to buy the top.
New traders use emotion and start buying when they see green candles, when that's the time to sell coin you bought 6 months prior, then you start buying the DOWNSIDE of the mountain, and end up buying clear down to the lowest trenches of the dips and make out like a bandit.
TRADING IS POSSIBLE. So is buying low.

Been saying for years that Bitcoin is like the second coming. We have left the age of Pisces (Jesus and the fish) and entered into the House of Aquarius... maybe it's time for a new religion to be born and save the world from the money changers and usury?? Just another shower thought.

Port 8333 has to be open to run a node. Ironic that the vehicle has the number on the license plate.

Lightning is a counter measure. Cant track "promises" of payments in Bitcoin that aren't stored in a database. You either have the tx to broadcast and get some BTC out of a channel, or you dont... also nobody knows who's promise is being routed around the network because only the final hop knows if it is the recipient or not. Great stuff. CHEAP AND SECURE payments. Sounds like digital cash again. 
Now if they can just get us some wallets working worth a shit. I've tried eclair several times and I can never find a route to blockstream (SLEEPYARK) to get a payment to them to buy a sticker.... so yeah. It's a ways off from mainstream production, but it's happening... I think Lightning needs more competent devs. Not that the current ones aren't competent, they just need more quantity to code faster and squash bugs faster.

Feel no need to argue. Just stating the facts... not saying they will hold up against a corrupt or tyrannical government.

Can't be a "money transmitter" when you aren't touching their fiat. The entire legal system is built upon the Federal Reserve monetary unit. ALL cases have a monetary settlement of some sort... how does it work when you are conducting business outside of a unit that is "legal for all debts, public and private"? Seems like crypto is outside of the jurisdiction of the verbiage of current laws...?
Guess time will tell....

Yeah, this one sounds like you are going to get scammed. Some are legit, but like you said, without a unique address for you to pay to, they can't verify who paid for what...

Sounds like how Federal Reserve made itself sound better, when it's no more federal than Federal Express. Using their tactics against them, riding their coat tails. Lol

You could buy it in fiat, but if you are using Bitcoin right now to buy every day things, you want to help support the Bitcoin economy like the miners wanted to help support the protocol by putting transactions into blocks.
You simply use Bitcoin because you want to. If you have to ask, "why not just use fiat?", do it! :) If you want to help "vote" for Bitcoin as opposed to your kind of fiat, use it.
