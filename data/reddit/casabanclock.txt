How much was your fee?

Are you new to bitcoin? I did pay for things almost daily 2 or even 4 years ago. Now it's just not possible without going insane with fees or waiting time. The realtime payments was a huge selling point for bitcoin. Google some Amir interviews from 2013 ;) I am wondering what happened to that guy ;D
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:01:37
It's not possible, everything costs money - especially if it gets as big as Bitcoin is today. Ask yourself who would pay for almost zero payments? Bill Gates? No, you and in case of Lightning Network it will be you again. Sidechains are basically digital banks in a sense and to stay operational there will be fees. So, the days of 2012 or 2014 are over ;(
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:30:39
But there are many videos and articles that say that Bitcoin is a great way to buy everything instantly and without any fees. For example 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:13:49
You are correct. LN are sidechainS.

Maybe, but this thing of selling firecrackers via internet is just idiotic, especially from the freedom loving Bitcoin crowd.
Again, he wouldn't be put in prison in the EU. The firecrackers he was selling were nothing against this  that has 50,000mg or 50g or explosive powder per one rocket. 
Man, I am glad I am in the EU sometimes.

Judging by the beach photo in Telegraph he is at least 150 kg, so, respect to the strong kidnappers ;D

The problem with Bitcoin Core is the unconfirmed transactions and the huge fees. Unless that is solved people will be using Bitcoin Cash instead I am afraid. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:36:32
Yeah, but realistically speaking, Bitcoin is unusable for payments right now, BCH is. 7 transactions per second is tragic.

Try sending 5.8 million emails with some nice hashing function between each send. Remember, each user has to be updated all the time ;)

I am all pro positivity and hard work instead of whining, but I think that your equation lacks one important thing and the thing is the energy, or to be more precise, the price for the energy to run bitcoin. 
Do you see the energy price going down in the next 5 years? I am trying to be open minded, but bitcoin needs energy and the energy is not free. Correct me if I am wrong.

The thing with the storing of those agricultural firecrackers [like this]( at home and selling them is just some fuck-the-state-regulation-thing. Yeah, he broke the law, but it's not like he created bombs or something. He did a great thing he left the US. People there are so weird when it comes to law. My friend was put in prison for 12 hours with drugged people even when he did nothing  (sorry it's in Czech). This wouldn't happen to him in the Czech republic. You guys sue people for anything and your police is much more aggressive than in Europe or Japan.

No, the comma is there.

This needs to be addresses in the news as well. I consider scaling to be much-much bigger problem than any hacking or legal issues.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:41
Does one transaction really cost 5 euros? Wow, I remember it costing only a few cents like less than 10 or 15 cents or something ;D. When did this happen? Are people OK with such high transaction fees?  
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:49:47


OK, have a nice day.

You don't know what you are talking about. From Wikipedia :


Also, in the US you are insane when it come to pyrotechnics. I can buy in EU things like this that contains 5000 mg of explosive powder per 1 firecracker via internet 
Boy, this thing right here:
contains 50 000 mg = 50g of explosive powder per one rocket !!! Guess what I can order that from the website right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:38:33
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:59
I don't like Roger Ver personally, but this thing with firecrackers is ridiculous. He was selling firecrackers that contain 50x less explosive powder per 1 rocket that you can buy right now in the EU (Slovakia) via internet  contains 50,000 mg of the explosive powder = 50 g!!! and he was selling firecrackers with something like 1000 mg  = 1g. of explosive powder. If he has done that in the EU he wouldn't go to jail. But in the US you have some weird laws, for example, according to this   in Massachusetts, Delaware and New Jersey regular people can NOT use firecrackers at all, wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:23:21
54 minutes ;( Is it worth watching? Why am I whining? I have watched some videos about etherium and all I was told was that it is revolutionary, I will be able to do contracts and scale stuff, but I wasn't wiser after I watched those videos.

Well there are problems with BTC right now, if you don't want to see them that's your decision, but fees, transaction times, LN hubs(banks) future... that's a lot of things to bother folks who know the crypto world. You are probably new, but the sidechains aka Lightning Network was very unpopular a few years ago. Even then people spoke about the 3rd parties/banks hijacking Bitcoin via sidechains and basically becoming bitcoin banks or deposit houses and taking fees instead of miners within those sidechains. It's kind of funny to see things after a few years of being "out". It's also scary. TL;DR BCH is not ideal, nothing is forever, but it's usable and most importantly without the sidechains "banks" threat that represents Lighting network.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:26:10
I am holding... to buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:30:49
I don't care. If I didn't buy food then I would be dead. Do you realize that? Or you eat from your parents-food money? I worked for bitcoin back then ;) I mined bitcoin. Did you use the first pool by Slush in the early days? Well, I did. Great times. So much enthusiasm and energy. The community back then was truly great. Now, it is all about rich dudes buying bitcoins without any knowledge of the 3 original files from November, 2008 that started all this craze. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:33
Yeah, he didn't follow the rules when selling agricultural firecrackers like these  but seriously, why are people making this thing like he was selling bombs or something. He just broke the law, because he didn't have the appropriate licence to sell those bird scaring rockets for farmers.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:25:27
I don't see Bitcoin as a payment method right now and even after the LN is implemented and used. The fees will be still the same on the main blockchain. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and other are starting to dominate the dayily payments etc. Bitcoin is now just an investment like gold. Not useful for daily transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:58
It will go up again, but until the lightning network is working, I don't see it going up again. Then it could be more than 100 000 per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:30
Hmm, this is a weird concept. I am not sure if I like it. I need to prepaid things and create additional addresses etc. I think the era of easy bitcoin from 2012 is over ;(. But maybe somebody will come with something better in the future.

His first code was in Visual Basic and later somebody else has done it in C++ using the Qt framework.

In Europe, if you earn more than for example 600 euros you don't pay for the first 20 or even more transactions nothing at all, also some banks will remove the monthly payment if you deposit each month like more than 1000 euros or so. It depends, but for .5 euro a transaction that's pricier than using a bank. Is bitcoin popular in America? Here in Europe it was quite popular 4 or 5 years ago, but now nobody use that for buying things unless they are crypto enthusiasts. I would say the bitcoin craze in Europe was biggest in 2013 and 2014. Now it's silent. Maybe because of the better integrated EU banking system? Everybody here use internet banking for payments of everything, it's especially easy when IBAN (24 letter/number code) became basically the only info you need when sending money to somebody. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:20:17
Well, you are misinformed or naive. The LN is of "whales". Google who is the pusher of the LN. There is a "nice" interview by a "nice smiling PR lady" on the main page of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:01:44
This will be a huge turn off for the new comers ;( 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:41:14
LN is basically one of the few ways how the gov/bank can tax you. The worst nightmare scenario is that each citizen would need to use his state licensed LN hub etc. 
I really think that the days of 2012 or 2014 are over and big fin institutions and governments will use LN (maybe it was even the plan - remember sidechains ideas are very old) to control and even tax you using bitcoin.

Ask China. They are going to ban VPNs from 2018.  If you are tech savvy you will find a way how to circumvent this ban technically, but then you are braking the law and can end up in prison.

Well, Esperanto is pretty easy - like Bitcoin. The only problem is that both are used by a very small minority.

I am with you, gold is useless for the basic life. To me the most valuable thing there is is a family with a house with some field you have your plants, water source, wood to burn, a gun, horse, chickens, horse, maybe car... family, etc. those are the most valuable things you need. The jewlery and tech are maybe nice, but to me kind of an after thought. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:41:30


it's open source, anybody can create a parallel multiplayer game where every move is recorded in a file shared among all the players; yes, that's bitcoin in a nutshel + minigames to discover new parts of the map aka mine bitcoins. bitcoin is not rare at all. Bitcoin is believe-money like all fiat-money. Bucks (animals; paradoxically worth 1 dollar in the past ;) ), furs (especially in the cold areas), eggs, meat, iron, bronze, gold, silver, even water if you live in desert... those are real things. fiat money and crypto currencies are believe money. I am sorry.

I think you would be surprised. I stopped using Bitcoin a few years ago.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:48:07




Unless you are an android, I think that the oxygen is pretty valuable thing, water as well. What about food? So, no, value is not subjective. If we want to be brutally raw, the mating partner (female?) aka spreading your genes aka you-forever is the most valuable thing there is. By the way, it can cost you several bucks with some retard gypsy Romanian female or several hundreds of thousands of dollars or even millions of dollars for a premium intelligent and beautiful female - maybe  a little less if you live in some religious communities with pre-born marriage arrangements. So, think twice, write once!
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:14:34
he was telling that the gold/silver/some-other-rare-metal has real value and Bitcoin is just a promise payment like fiat money. You can make a bullet or a gold teeth from it or use it for connectors or medicine etc. You can do nothing with any of current cryptocurrencies (maybe something will emerge in the future, I am not completely dismissing this possibility) with the "switch" states in the chips of your hdd/ssd ;) Show me one example how can I use the state of the ssd/hdd aka Bitcoin's blockchain state at a given point of time in the real life. If I was 18 nm big I could perhaps have a nice parkour run inside those chips of the disk, but not when I am 6 foot 4.
