And even that quote "I'm not involved in that any more" could be expedient paraphrasing by Leah. I never thought i would find a journalist so despicable.

Not every newcomer is on or even aware of bitcointalk &amp; reddit. Come on, OP has a point here. Jeez. 
For a lot of us, Gox and its shenanigans have been par for the course since 2011 but please put yourself in the shoes of somebody who is not on reddit or bitcointalk. And newsflash, not everyone is.

This is BS. I do not buy this portion of tax advice from OP. Stocks have lot selectors now to avoid this issue. And you can't classify bitcoin as 'property' and still have it be fungible and follow FIFO rules. I actually have rigorous documentation of my btc transactions to trace every single cost-basis if needed.

Isn't there any disclosure from US Marshals about revenue received so we can calculate effective price per btc?? I imagine US Marshals would have no need to hide that?

How about a bank safety deposit box? I just prefer the simplicity of cold storage. Secondly, I think you need to be more concerned about losing the paper wallet than someone swiping it. Latter is more likely from a probability point of view. So maybe just have two copies stored in 2 different geographic locations.

Is this a joke? Please look up mike Hearn. Isn't he the same guy who tried to peddle some weird colored coin experiment a couple years ago.

Yes I agree there is no such thing but US Federal regulations are requiring exchanges to get money transmitter licenses. So, effectively these exchanges have to go through regulatory compliance just like a remitter. Feds are going to be a huge pain in the butt for bitcoin...

Well, you have to remember that btc has ease of transmission as an edge over gold. You can transmit your gold biscuits to the other end of the world without catching an expensive (and sometimes illegal) flight

This is not a good thing for bitcoin. If bitcoin remitters are also forced to do this, it takes away from some of the intrinsic advantages of bitcoin

I understand the game but how exactly is a miner supposed to use this derivative? Sorry i am not well-versed with mining. What are the implications of hash-rate volatility on mining?
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:56:37
Thank you all for that info. I think i understand. I guess my confusion arose from the fact that there was that hard-fork in March-April when, as i understand, miners reverted the client version they were using.
This bitcoin game theory stuff is amazingly complicated!
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:11:11
Interesting. I will look this up. I didn't know individuals could do this. Thanks !

This post raises a valid point. btc's relationship with the US govt. is one of the most profound issues facing bitcoin. 
I feel that this sub keeps underestimating this angle. The most powerful government on earth has everything to lose via bitcoin. 
All i know is that when you have power, you will do everything you can to sustain it. You might not succeed, but you'll sure as hell give a fight. If anyone thinks the US govt isn't going to fight this, i'd love to get some of what you're smoking.

Haha, exactly

Yes, i am having the exact same problem on btc i sold this week. Looks like its wait and watch based on the support thread posted above. They haven't gotten back to my email either but hopefully it gets resolved in a few days. :(

How do you become a registered money transmitter?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:45:28
It is not out of control. It just looks larger in absolute $ terms because of rise in BTC price. It hovers around a 10% differential on average. As of this writing, bitstamp is at $205 &amp; gox at $231 which is completely typical.
My thoughts on the reasons for a 10% differential:
There is some anecdotal evidence that mt. gox will expedite USD withdrawals for a 5% fee. If you add 2-3% transaction costs and wire transfer fees, the effective arbitrage opportunity comes down to ~2% which is as it should be. (There is no free money! Not a lot anyway)
The effective 2% spread is also consistent with price differentials across various Chinese btc exchanges.

We need a de-centralized bitcoin foundation. In other words, we need many Bitcoin Foundations. Its too risky to rely on this one entity for the common good of bitcoin. 
The mining community needs to boycott Avalon.
Businesses and exchanges need to repudiate such initiatives and nip them in the bud.
I don't understand why some folks are claiming this is hysteria on the part of bitcoin users. This is a very serious development attacking the very heart of bitcoin. Maybe nothing will come of it  and we'll be fine but, really, the bitcoin community cannot be complacent. These sort of attacks are just the beginning. Lets rally for a decentralized world.

Mike Hearn is such a hack. Someone needs to tell him his 15 minutes have been up ever since he started supporting shady ideas like colored coins and coinvalidation
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:24:03
I dont know why people are getting so annoyed. You know the bitcoin world is full of scams and withdrawal issues and there is a lot of money at stake. You can get annoyed about a coinbase thread today but tomorrow it could happen to you. Reddit bitcoin is one of the few avenues available for consumer protection because of its visibility. So I am sorry folks think they are getting spammed. Being so intolerant isnt helping anybody.

"Ability to move wealth across borders" is a huge deal. If bitcoin captures even 5% of that market, you are talking about tens of billions of dollars flowing through the bitcoin economy. 
I do agree with you though that prohibition would put a serious damper on mainstream adoption.

I am in california and i think a money transmission license costs $3500 here not to mention cumbersome regulatory hoops and lawyer fees. So, it does not look trivial to me. Which state are you in?

I completely agree with you and i think some folks on this thread are in la-la land when they refuse to see the validity of the deflation bias critique. Lower discretionary spending =  lower economic activity, period. 
Having said that, i am bullish on bitcoin in general because people also forget that there are multiple bull-scenarios for bitcoin. 
Bitcoin does not necessarily need to succeed as a currency (although, that is the ultimate kind of success). Hoarding itself (especially in countries with high inflation rates) is valid use of bitcoin. As a case in point, i refer everyone to Gold price charts of the last 30 years.
Bitcoin as a payment network for remittance,etc. is also a use case where deflationary bias is mostly irrelevant. This is a multi-hundred billion dollar market and if bitcoin captures a small percentage, that alone would justify bitcoin prices today. 
As for mainstream economic usage as currency, micro-payments,etc. i think only time will tell. Deflation is certainly going to make things challenging but what happens when btc economic activity slows down and btc price crashes? Don't the hoarders now have an incentive to stop hoarding? So, you see this is a feedback system with a lot of variables and i think it is too simplistic when folks claim (The Atlantic has an article doing this) that bitcoin will never succeed because of deflation.

Lets say this software upgrade is pushed through eventually. What incentive do the miners have to accept a transaction-fee efficient bitcoin client?

There is a competing service in the works. Its a silicon valley startup called Buttercoin. Hasn't launched yet though...

Isn't hardware prone to get corrupted over time? Just like your flash drive will die on you at some point. I would avoid Trezor for that reason even though its a cool concept.

Well, cant they use XBTC then for the ISO code? Less confusing...
