Seems like a good idea for hyping/boosting the new expansion as well!

It probably won't save the whole market, however, it will most likely increase gambling by those into bitcoin.

Yeah, let's AAALL buybuybuybuy BTC and then use it to buybuybuybuy socks because [winter is coming](

Can I submit them through smoke signals?

It all depends on what hash rate you can get to. I dunno how good this one would be but supposedly pretty decent. CPU is pretty outdated though. You can always try to mine and if your hash rate is low you can just play mine sweeper instead.
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:44:52
Yeah, I figured that would be the case
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:46:15
No idea, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. I recommend you to change to another pool in the meantime.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:50:39
Yeah, no, it wouldn't feel right. Also, it could be viewed as right out stealing if it was from someone's hacked account.
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:04:07
Nope, not so far! Only the official announcement they posted a couple of weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:44:06
I don't really know about your second question but regarding the first one cgminer is supposedly better. It is less user friendly but it's slightly more efficient. The difference isn't extremely remarkable though, you might not even notice it. 
Also, if you're using CPU mining I belive the power consumption will outweigh your mining profit so you'll actually lose money. Just a tip. The same goes for most GPU mining as well.

Let's just call them litecoins for optimum confusion.

So, your wallet is very simply put your online banking account for bitcoins. You get a transaction address (wallet address), which works as your account code. People use this to send bitcoins to your wallet. The address should be shown in your wallet, and it looks like a long line of random numbers and letters.
When you make a transaction you enter the address you want to send it to and the amount of btc you want to send. Other users who send bitcoins to you will do the same thing but with your address. If you want someone to send bitcoins to your wallet you simply give them the address and they can transfer money to your account (wallet).
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:26:38
Yee, bitcoins (or BTC) is a currency and your wallet is your account used to handle your money.

Mining is not really profitable. If you buy a mining rig it can take up to half a year just to break even. I advice you to ask @_date: 2013-12-18 16:51:49
Welcome to 1923 Germany everybody!
@_date: 2013-12-16 13:05:59
Awesome! I'll make sure to check it out!
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:47:28
Haha! My GF kept yelling that I should payout and that we could buy a house in France. I decided not to.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:45:39
Oh, this is a great idea! I'll try this in the future when I'm out playing.
Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:50:10
Any time, mate!

Excited to invade esports with bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:04:22
That's what's so cool about it this time. It's not just a peak it's a slow devilish crawl upwards, all the way to heaven and the saints. And Bitcoin Jesus. God, I miss Bitcoin Jesus...
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:50:42
Many different economic classic graphs show that the "bubble" will burst, however many graphs show the exact opposite.Truth is, we can't really predict exactly what will happen to bitcoin as there's never been anything like this before.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:55:07
You have about 7000 USD in BTC. Go buy yourself multiple copies of GTA!

 is of course more interesting than a possible new world currency. I heard he got abs this time....
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:39:17
That or some super tech "detection" of lost bitcoins and then a replacement somewhere somehow. No idea how it would work though but I trust terminators to figure that one out.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:38:45
Do you live in the south of Sweden? I can make sushi and I accept bitcoins, let me just go buy rice first!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:46:00
Good question. I suppose my wording wasn't the best. What I meant was that there is "proof" for increases of the same percentage as currently, as well as proof for a leveling out of the growth. My point is that many times you can find trends and predictions if you look for them.
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:45:36
Haha, we'll see :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:25:31
Bitcoin mining without a mining rig ([BitcoinMining]( is where you learn about those) is usually very inefficient.
In order to send someone bitcoins you only need their bitcoin address and some bitcoins to send them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:36:32
Right now bitcoin is an investment like many other things. It does however look like the price is going to increase even further so in my opinion it would be a good investment. And you can of course also use it to buy things online, as it is a currency, it's not only a way to increase the amount of fiat currency on your bank account.
When it comes down to it it is of course your own decision if you do or don't want to invest.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:13:40
Not too weird. The probability that it should happen at some point is quite big as Ghash.IO controls a big part of the total hash rate.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:32:03
I think you did well. I especially like megatoshi.

I'm the proud owner of 0.03BTC. GPU mining ftw!
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:26:07
Thanks! This is awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:17:01
Yeee, same here. Realized something was up when I saw I had -36 BTC as unspent resources or whatever.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:27:52
Very interesting thought! never thought of that actually. It works, as bitcoins can't be replaced if lost like a dollar for example. However, I'm not sure to what extent this affects bitcoin as a whole. 
It of course does happen and I suppose there would be some way of getting around it if it actually did become a major problem.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:33:29
Haha, yeeah that's exactly what I did. It's really not that hard and the community is really great so you'll get any help you need if you just ask for it!
@_date: 2013-10-23 10:44:23
Thanks! I was amazed too... The dollar is like the mark in 1923 :P
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:47:47
Ah, OK! Thanks, mate!
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:35:56
I'm just waiting for bitcoin to take over the world. Also when I started I owned around 4 usd in BTC and now I have about 30 so I call that a win! :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:11:58
You could simply start by investing a small amount, and if you feel more confident later you could then invest more.
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:55:30
Bear in mind I'm a high school student so I don't have to pay my own taxes and stuff. It's not like I'd spend the money on my mortgage or something smart like that xD
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:10:26
Yes, and it sadly seems like it will be for a while longer.

Anytime, just doing my duty to help the bitcoin community grow!

What you want is for your best share (BS) to be higher than the difficulty (609M). 
That's when you do a silly happy dance.

When is this going to be available as an app for iOS/Android? I'm a very busy person so it'd be nice to be able to lose all my bitcoins on the train or perhaps when I'm working out.
@_date: 2013-12-16 08:09:07
Ye, seems like the price of LTC to BTC is more beneficial than LTC to USD for example.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:35:27
I believe you can use both at the same time, but I must say I'm not sure as I'm not that into mining. However, the CPU will not really be that big of a boost to your mining. GPU mining is more than 100x more efficient than CPU mining.
