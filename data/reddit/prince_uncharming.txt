They changed their pricing model a while back to just have the sale pricing be standard pricing. They had signs like "fair price, every day!" which I thought was awesome. 
Sales slowed WAY down, they fired the CEO that had that awful (in their opinion) idea, and have gone back to the standard practice of inflated pricing always-on-sale crap.
They realized customers only buy when they think they're getting a deal, and most people only think something is a deal if there's a sign saying 50% off because they're stupid as fuck when it comes to making purchasing decisions

I think he means "why is it a big deal that TD will accept Bitcoin now, if you have to use your real cash to buy the bitcoins anyways?  Why go cash-&gt;btc-&gt;tigerdirect when its easy enough to just go cash-&gt;tigerdirect.  I cant imagine that its easier to do so, and its definitely less convenient since there is no way to get chargebacks etc if TD fucks up like they usually do.

Yeah I somehow I read your first paragraph as 100%... Looking back now I'm kind of embarrassed at my lack of reading comprehension

Lol you have no idea how stocks work do you. Stocks are absolutely not "backed" by a company, a stock is only worth as much as someone will pay for it. It's part ownership in a company.
If the company goes bankrupt, as a stockholder, you are last in line to any money left after paying debtors, just like how if you own a small business that goes bankrupt and you sell it for 500k but owe the bank a million, the bank has claim to the whole 500k.

In what way is it fraud? It's not like they're promising these people lifelong jobs. Plus they're contractors anyways and the  rule of every company is to fuck the contractors
