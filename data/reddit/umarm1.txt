That’s dumb. Bitcoin is definitely permissible and I’m a Muslim 
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:52:16
Don’t believe every detail you read lol. Probably a few Turkish “imams” said BTC is haram and now this article is claiming the whole of the Turkish Muslim community lol 
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:07:55
I reckon this is all bullshit and if there is a “halal coin” what exactly will make it halal and how would it be different

As long as you have your passphrase you can recover your BTC. However, if you forget/lose your passphrase then your BTC will be lost 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:07:06
That’s as far as my technical knowledge goes I’m afraid lol but there’s always going to be changes in the pipeline to improve BTC and they may come in hard forks or soft forks.

Move your BTC to a wallet. Use Coinbase just as an exchange to buy/sell.

From what I understand the tangle gets rid of minors so essentially every user of the IOTA network is involved in deciding if a transaction is valid etc. I think this basically helps with scalability as well as having no fees at all as there are no minors.
This was just a couple minutes of quick reading so obviously not a technical explanation.

Bitcoin determines the value of the current cryptos I assume? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:50:50
Will do..thanks for that!
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:29:05
Thanks ����

Is there an iOS app for Gemini??
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:19:41
In a couple of months? I really hope so!
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:31:36
Well if you know nothing about stocks then don’t try trading with BTC because you’ll probably make a mess of it and lose your money. Long term it’s probably best to invest small amounts every few weeks depending on your budget. There’s no harm in buying more if there’s a dip but you’re not guaranteed it will rise anytime soon so just think about that before you make hasty decisions.

More secure than a windows desktop wallet and I can’t be bothered to mess around with a hardware wallet unless I’ve got a lot of serious money in this 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:33:44
I think it depends which exchange you’re using. From what I’ve read/heard some exchanges have insurance of some sort but I’m not sure how it works 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:12:02
Yeah there’s no excuse for it but it doesn’t seem like anythings going to change 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:19:43
Hypothetically yes you would then have two coins I believe but the value for core would never go to zero as there would always be someone holding that coin. Technically for a network to run all you need is two nodes and ideal at least one of them a miner.

I’m still fairly new to reddit and crypto myself but I’m currently using a wallet on my iPhone called Copay. So I buy my coins on Coinbase exchange and then send them over to my Copay wallet. 
With a wallet you’re generated a 12 phrase code which is yours to write down and keep safe. The code is basically to ensure you keep control of your wallet and your coins. It’s your responsibility.
Whereas your coins in Coinbase are theoretically not yours as the exchange owns them so if they get hacked or go bankrupt you’ll lose whatever you have in there.
Hope that makes some sense.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:06:06
Definitely not impossible to do 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:17:58
Yh I can’t log in..maintenance or something 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:19:54
Looks like a load of crap but how does this effect BTC in general? Good or bad? And why?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:55
They just can’t handle that amount of traffic and transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:58:10
What’s bitcoin futures??
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:54:51
What is future???

Could’ve made a serious profit in a matter of minutes if Coinbase didn’t crash! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:16:57
Any recommend exchanges that support segwit in the UK?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:51:28
Thanks

You know any good exchanges and iOS wallets for Monero by any chance?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:27:45
I’m not a tech guy but I’m quite confident that iOS is much more secure than windows. Have you got a link for the article?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:46
Yeah technically I’m not sure what the actual change would be. But it will be a group of decentralised individuals that would make that vote but of course it would have to be the majority to implement a fork 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:16:48
Please explain how you came to that conclusion 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:13
Crazy dip! Time to buy!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:57:41
If I’m not wrong I think Monero solves this problem by making all transactions and balances private

I’ve remortgaged the house 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:30:51
Yes for some users..
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:43:31
Oh okay thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:10:06
I’m new to this so sorry for the simple questions but how do you accidentally issue a fee??
