Same thing happens with stocks. Are you saying we shouldn't have any capital gains? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:43:24
How about mutual funds? (I assume you know what a mutual fund is, I can explain if not)
Let's say I buy a stock mutual fund and hold it. I never sell the shares, and lets pretend I don't get any distributions from this particular fund. But, on January 10th, I get a 1099 that says I have $1000 worth of gains.
Here's what happened. The fund sold shares of "X" for a profit. The fund then bought shares of "Y" with the money from the sale. They didn't distribute anything back. From my perspective, they simply traded shares of X for Y. But, according to the IRS, taxes have to be paid on the gains the fund realized on shares of "X".
Now, let's say in the meantime, the market crashes. The fund is worth 1/2 of it's original value. It doesn't matter. I still owe taxes on that paper gain.  
How is this different from your example? I never saw profit, yet I owe taxes? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:00:45

No. 
You seem to be arguing that the money deposited in a bank isn't yours because you technicality loan it to the bank (and loaned money can be lost). But, legally, anything you loan still belongs to you. The money you loan to the bank is still YOUR money, your just bound by certain terms of calling that loan (and it can be lost).
But, if you want to argue philosophically and not legally, that it's not your money because the bank could lose it. I'm countering with the fact that fiat in a bank has more legal protections than cryoto on the block chain.    
If you have some other argument that the fiat you own isn't yours, pray tell. I must have missed your point.

You can see this happen today. How many people wait for a "Sale" or another event before they buy. Maybe you don't, but there are tons of websites out there to tell you the best time of year to buy "X", or help you track the price of goods to find the best sale.  
Now, the (economics) problem is that if I wait a month to buy an item, I'm also a lot more likely to decided that I don't need it, or that I can wait another month. 


We'd be stuck in a permanent recession. And, recessions are uneven. Look at the great recession. Unemployment rose to over 10%. But, it wasn't like everyone just got 10% less. Most of us continued as is with no real impact. It was the 10% who lost jobs that had trouble putting food on their table. And, for a variety of reasons, this will happen again. We might eventually even out. But, for decades, we'll have a massive suffering underclass. 
So, this might be good for society in the short term. But, it will be paid for with massive suffering from the current generations. It will be a lot easier to simply work towards post scarcity.

I don't understand why anyone thinks crypto will replace banks. Crypto might replace the printing of fiat. But, as long as people want to borrow money, banks will be around. Whether they are lending fiat or bit coin, the principals of fractional banking can still apply.

I'm more curious to know if other people have different numbers. I've seen several people say, it can go higher because "once X% of the US economy is with bitcoin", or once "Y% of the global GDP is on the block chain." But, each time, Bit Coin / Crypto's market cap exceeds the quoted percentage of the global money supply.
So, I'm partly wondering if people truly believe crypto is less efficient that fiat and needs different ratios, or people haven't even considered how much coin is necessary to support the number of transactions they are imagining.
Basically, if people had based their analysis on math, it would make me feel a lot better about crypto.

Man, not a common criticism, that the US taxes more than other countries. I totally understand where you're coming from. It seems like the US should update and adapt and make it easier for the new tech. If things work out, I'm sure the laws will be updated eventually. 
But, personally, I view this as a non issue. Crypto wins when it stabilizes with a few winners at a fix value. It can't act as a store of wealth or a currency with +/- 100% swings in a month. 
Sure, people are getting into tax trouble now. But, look into what happened to people who exercised stock options circa 2000. Lots of people went bankrupt over paper profits on dot com stocks.

You don't have to spot the bottom. As long as you always sell higher than you buy, you make money. A quote attributed to Bernard Baruch is, "I made my money by selling too soon." 
In other words, he never picked the peak, but always sold when he had a good profit. When he was confident we weren't near another peak, he'd get back in, and repeat. 
Just blindly holding an assets is a 401K / College fund investment strategy. It's not a strategy for making money in the short term. To do that, you have to buy and sell, and take a profit to live on.

No, it's not. It belongs to a wallet ID. If I lose access to that wallet, I've lost the coin. There is no legal or technical mechanism for me to get that coin back.
On the flip side, if I lose $10,000 in cash. Legally, that's still my money. If it's lost in the dump, and someone finds it, it has to be turned in. If I deposit money into the bank, the FDIC insures me up to $250K that I'll get it back. If I forget about it, the state has mechanisms to return my money to me.  
Neither system is 100%. But, cash seems to have more protections IMO.

First, understand fractional reserve banking. It's easiest to understand if we just pretend there is 1 bank in the world. We'll use a reserve rate of 10%.  
1. The government prints $100,000 and gives to the bank.
2. The bank holds $100K.
3. The bank keeps $10K, and lends john $90K.
4. John buy a Tesla from Mark for $90.
5. Mark deposits $90K into the bank.
6. The bank holds $9K of that $90K, and loans Jim $81K bank. 
7. Jim buys a Car from Sue for $81K
8. Sue deposits the $81K back into the bank.
9. The bank keeps $8100, and loans Jane $72,900.
So, at the end of the game:
* Jane has $72,900 in cash
* The bank has $27,100 in cash
* The bank has $171K in IOUs (Loans)
* The bank owes Mark $90K 
* The bank owes Sue $81K
* Jim and John have cars.
There is only ever $100,000 in cash, (held by Jane and the bank) but the bank owes Mark and Sue $171K. That $171K is commonly called bank money. It's money owed that exceeds the amount of cash in the system.
This system plays out in the real world, with billions of people and thousands of banks.  
But, the same can happen with bit coin. 
1. The network creates coins and gives it to miners. 
2. The miner deposit it in the bank account (A transfer between the miner and bank is recorded on the block chain).
3. The miner has an IOU from the bank, and the bank has coin in it's wallet.
4. Someone borrows money from the bank (Another transaction is recorded on the block chain, from the bank to the borrower).
5. Now, the bank Owes the miner, and has an IOU from the borrower.
6. The borrower is going to use the coin, but it will probably find it's way back to the bank. Once it does, the bank lends the same coin out again, and again, and keep track of all the IOUs.
Make sense?

You're 37, you're young enough to recover, even if bitcoin doesn't. But, don't kid yourself. Plenty of people were saying going all in on bitcoin was stupid, even in July / August of 2017 when it was mooning. Even people on this forum were saying don't go all in.

I know you referred to true believes in a metaphorical sense. And, I don't think anyone thinks of bitcoin as a religion. That said, **Some** people here really exhibit traits similar to the hard core religious.
1. A willingness to go down with the ship (HODL to 0)
2. Acting in the best interest of the group (buy, buy, buy)
3. "Faith" in the future (it ALWAYS recovers)
4. "Beliefs not founded in facts (Disrupting baking in 2018!)  
5. Anger and irrational response when challenged (pick a comment thread)
6. Refusal to accept, or grossly overlooking, short comings
I say this not as a criticism of bitcoin or crypto in general. But, more as an interesting observation of individuals behavior.

I'm really not sure what you're saying. People have no taxes to pay if they didn't realize a gain. If someone bought at $1, held at $19K, and still holds today, they haven't realized a gain. What taxes are you talking about these people owing? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:27:32
That won't help. Run the math. 
* The US GDP is $18.57 T
* The total USD in circulation is $1.5 T
Since not all of the US GDP is in USD, but most is, I think it's fair to say $1 in circulation support $10 in GDP (The numbers still check out if you add all the currency in the world to global GDP) 
So, that tells us how much in bit coin we should need to support 0.5% of the US GDP. First, 0.5% of GDP is (18.5T * 0.005) or $92.5B. Needing 1 Bitcoin to support 10 bit coins in annual transactions means we'd needing $9.25B in bitcoin. 
* The bit coin market cap ( a coin) is $145M USD. 
* We need $9.25B for 0.5% of GDP
Using that math, bit coin is still 15.6 times too expensive. A fair market price of bit coin WHEN it supports 0.5% of the USD GDP would be $544 a coin (if supply was the same). But, we all know there are still coins to be mined. So, the actual value should be less.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:00:24

This cycle is different. There's never been this much mainstream news coverage of crypto before. People who didn't know what it was 3 months ago, bought in at $19K. 
So, the noobs sitting around watching the news and seeing a get rich quick scheme are the one who drove the price to $19K. And, they are the ones getting burned and dropping out.
The problem for the holders is that those noobs aren't going to forget. Someone who lost 60% in 3 months isn't going to be so fast to get back onto the same train. So, w/o the noobs, who's going to drive the price back up?

The IRS specifically excluded stocks and securities from [1031]( Many people thought Crypto DID quality for 1031 exchanges prior to 2018 but the IRS never said. Why prior to 2018? Well, because in 2018, congress changed the rules so only real estate qualifies for 1031 exchanges.
Now, if I trade baseball card for a signed baseball, I have to pay taxes on that, just like you have to pay taxes on your crypto transaction.  
Now, I'm not saying I like it. I'm saying what it is. No one talked about the changes to 1031 during the debate about taxes. Why, because usually only rich people have to worry about 1031s. And, no one gives a shit what's fair to rich people. So, politically, it's a non issue. 
In fact, most of what your dealing with in crypto is due to the arms war between tax payers and the government for 200 years. The law governing accredited investors was put in place in 1933. It's almost 100 years old. Sure, is this good for crypto. Probably not. But, do you think 99% of Americans care?

@_date: 2018-02-04 22:24:13


Do you have a source for that? Lots of people buy with cash, then hold. Or, cash out into Fiat. Or, actually buy something with it like they were supposed to. I'd be curious to see the actual crypto to crypto volume. 


Where did you get that? If you buy 1 Bitcoin on day X  and then trade that Bitcoins for Etherum on day Y, when Bitcoin is  you simply report at $2K gain was realized on day Y. There is no need to go into cash as an interim step. If they don't already, one day, the crypto exchanges should be able to issue you a 1099 with the proper values, so you don't have to do the math. (It gets complicated if you have coins with different cost basis).  


You REALLY don't want to cash out every year. In the US, you only have to pay gains when you realize it. That means, if you buy bitcoin, and hold it for 20 years, you don't have to pay a penny in taxes until you sell it 20 years from now. That's when the gain is realized. (Trading or spending crypto counts as being realized too). Now, he's why you don't want to sell early. If you hold the asset for less than 12 months, it's a short term capital gain paid at your ordinary income tax rate. If its held more than 12 months, it's a LONG term capital gain which is paid at a lower rate. In fact, if your income is below $38K or $77K (married), your long term gain rate is 0%. 
All of this is being said by an amateur. There's all sorts of professional information right now on how taxes apply to crypto, so you should you should double check what I'm saying.

I'm not saying it's OK. I don't personally like these rules. I'm just explaining the logic behind it. Lots of people on reddit (maybe not this sub) support the government restricting these sorts of articles (like sub prime mortgages). 
As for the difference between this and gambling. I think it's a volume issue. There aren't that many bad gamblers, so they just hurt themselves. The stock market crash of 1929 and the recent sub prime mortgage bubble both took the whole economy down. If you read about the 29 crash, at lot of it had to do with individuals borrowing money to buy stocks they knew nothing about.  So, I think they want to avoid a repeat of that. You can shoot yourself and no one but your family cares. If  10 million people do it, we have a national problem.

First, I'm not a fan of government regulation. I'm playing a bit of devil's advocate. I'm trying to find out if this sub really dislikes government regulation, dislike the specific regulations, or just dislike regulations that impact them.  
That said, I didn't lie. I truly believe it's easier to fuck over 1000 little fish than 10 big one. There are, of course, exceptions. Lots of of them. But, in general, here's some of the logic behind it.  
1. Someone investing $100K is more likely to pay close attention to the investment than someone investing $1K. (S)he will simply do more research into the venture before writing the check. 
2. A rich person will have more ability to check something out. They'll have accountants and lawyers who can help them with contracts, and to run numbers if they don't know it themselves.
3. Rich people tend to be older, and are more likely to have seen the Dot Com bubble and Beanie Baby Mania, and know they shouldn't invest their student loans into bit coin (whoops, wrong question). 
That said, some rich people will get fucked over. So, why does it matter. Well, it's a matter of means. Simply put, a rich person will probably have more ability to recover and more options. I can go into why, but then I'd write a book. 
There is, of course, middle ground. No one is going bankrupt if the lose $100 or even $1000. But, you didn't ask me what I thought we should do about it.

Public companies (ones normal people can invest in) have to follow a lot of rules. They also have to do lot of reporting and paperwork that holders of private stock don't have to do. 
Public companies have to report on their financials every quarter. They have to include an honest prediction about how the market will perform, if they will make or lose money, etc... When the CEO buys or sells a ton of stock, they have to tell people. And, the share holders can generally buy and sell the stock to whom ever they want. 
Private companies aren't bound by those rules. They could be losing money every month, and taking on tons of debt without the share holders knowing. The CEO can sell all his shares and skip town tomorrow, and the stock holders might not find out for months.  And, the shares are normally restricted. If I buy $100,000 I might not be able to sell it to anyone but the CEO. 
Private companies don't have the same duty to the share holders. They don't have to act in the share holders best interest. So, the CEO can buy an office building personally, rent it to his company, even if that isn't the best deal for the corporation (very, very common behavior and legal). A public company can't do that. Such a conflict of interest could be considered fraud. 
Finally, the share holders of a public company have more power to remove the CEO and control the actions of the company. In a private company, the share holders generally have much less power.  
The view is that those rules protect the investors. And, it's very true. Lots of private company CEOs do things that would land them in jail for decades if they were the CEO of a public company. But, as the head of a private company, their actions are either 100% legal, or not illegal enough for anyone to take action.

The US and Canada can't even go all in with the metric system. It would take a major shock like WW III or Yellostone blowing to make this a reality within our lifetime. The economy would have to crumble and be rebuilt from scratch. Short of that, the best we can hope for is some small unstable country to throw a Hail Mary and hope to Crypto rescues their economy (they adopt USD today). If that works out, we might be on a 100 year long road to getting crypto mass adopted. But, I'm not holding my breath.

Your right about media coverage. But, that adds to my point. A lot of the drive was from billions in new money rushing into crypto. Where's the next $100 Billion dollars going to come from. It takes a LOT less absolute money to move the price from $100 a coin to $10K a coin than it will to drive the price from $10K a coin to $1M a coin.  
And, on that front. Do you really think the noobs who jumped in the water in 2017 and lost their shirt are going to be so fast to jump back in and drive the price right back up?

What banks are banning people from buying bit coins? I haven't heard of a single bank that has a ban of ACH or debit transfers to an exchange.
Deposited money is YOUR money. Credit Card money is THEIR money, and they have a right to say no, no, no.
For the record, credit card companies don't like it if you start to use them a lot at strip clubs, casinos, or a number of other similar establishments that show risky behavior (i.e., bank won't get their $$ back).

What's the adoption rate by these groups? Do we have knowledge that online casinos are using coins, or that unbanked people had adopted crypto? 


Downloading a few books is very different than moving tens of thousands of dollars though backdoor channels. The jail time is 0 with one and potentially a LOT with the other. Again, people would have to be very motivated to use it if it became banned.

That would be disrupting the government. 
Retail banks are engaged in fractional reserve banking. That doesn't create money. Instead, it allows the same dollar to be loaned out again many, many times. It creates virtual money supply, but not real money.
The thing is, fractional reserve banking could be done more easily with bitcoin or ether or any other crypto coin than with cash. The laws of economics that allow for "Bank Money" would also allow for "Bank Coin".

The hodlers will be satisfied when the price stabilizes. When it appears there is no longer any gain to be had. At that point, it no longer makes sense to hodl, anymore than it makes sense to stash FIAT into your mattress. In theory, that could be any price from $1 to $1,000,000 a coin. 
The bottom floor on bitcoin at that point would be caused by ensuring there are enough coins in circulation to handle the transactions needed. Today's there's about $1T in US FIAT to support our $18T economy. So by that measure, the market cap for bitcoin would simply need to be about 1/10 to 1/20 the total volume of bitcoin transactions in a day. 
On the other end, there is another interesting limit. A coin can only be split to 8 decimal places. A coin value over $1,000,000 would mean you can no longer represent a penny. So, while that's probably OK, there is going to be a theoretical limit. For example, we can't just say, the smallest transaction allowed is $10.

This place seems to be the peanut gallery. A lot of pipe dreams, made up technical analysis, and complaining. Compare this place to a lot of other subs, and it really has an immature feel.

IPO and ICOs are two different things. Crypto isn't regulated as a security. There is nothing that stops normal people from getting into an ICO except for the organizations offering the coins. What's the specific issue you're referring to? 


I doubt its true that we're the ONLY. Some countries are tax free on crypto currency, but many also have no capital gains period. But, in the US, crypto transactions aren't any different than a transaction with stock, commodities, art, or collectibles. If I buy a share of stock for $50, sell it for $100, and the next day buy a $100 share of stock, I owe the IRS taxes on my $50 gain. Why should crypto be different? 
*The ability of use a 1031 exchange and carry your gain forward (as for 2018) only applies to real estate.

To me, the idea of "investing" only as much as you can lose, means only investing an amount that won't impact your retirement or future. But, there's no set amount. A 37 year old with $1M net worth can probably afford to invest 10% in something ultra high risk, like bitcoin. On the other hand, a 37 year old with $100K net worth couldn't afford to take that 10% ($10K) risk. 
There's also sorts of if's / and's / but's... that make this a complicated calculation. Your income, your age, your family situation, your debt load, etc... But, a high risk investment like this is hardly any worse than 3rd car or a 2nd house.

It's your $$. You've loaned it to the bank but it still belongs to you. However, there are limitations on when and how you (and if) can ask for your $$ back, just there there are limitations on the bank when they loan you $$ for a mortgage. They can't just demand 100% of their money tomorrow, and neither can you.
This falls into a gray area. They can't saying you can't spend your $$ this way. However, if this is with a debit card, they are saying you can't use the bank's money exchange mechanism to send $$ to this person for this purpose.

It's not that simple. How many bitcoin transactions that are processed isn't a matter of raw power. If 1/2 the miners quit tomorrow, the hash difficulty would go down, the block rate would be restored, and the number of transactions processed per second would stay the same. On the flip side, if power becomes cheaper, we'll get more miners and the difficulty will go up. If processing power increases, we'll get increases in the hash rate, which will cause the difficulty to go up. The power consumption problems STAYS.
The only solution is technologies like lightning. But, these aren't really bitcoin, nor do they have the same benefits of having your transactions written to the distributed ledger. So, having Visa / Mastercoin as lightning nodes doesn't really sounds like technology saving bitcoin to me. It sounds like a corporate takeover.

The issue isn't savings crypto vs fiat. If you buy crypto with 0 expectations that it is going to go up, you're saving in crypto. But, everyone here saying hodl is doing it with the expectation that the price will go up. No one says HODL fiat as an investment. If you want to "Invest", you do it in Stock or bonds. You can buy both just fine with Crypto. The price is simply listed in FIAT.  


Well, it's stable. The price doesn't go up or down 10% in a day. Today, no one is going to put a sticker on a car and set a 3 btc price. 
Anyone who accepts payment in btc today, just does it as a means transferring fiat. Until the price is listed in btc, it's still not a currency.

In theory, this can be changed just like block size. In reality, it would probably result in endless arguments and a hard fork (just like block size). 
If bitcoin succeeds, we'll probably end up with a fractional banking system and payment processors (credit cards / paypal) built on top, just like we have with FIAT. Normal people will NEVER touch a bitcoin or have our transactions on the block chain. Instead, our transactions will exist in a bank ledger (like today). Only large bank to bank and corporate transactions will be worth the precious blockchain space.

That's simply not true. 
1. A phone sensor and lens can take snapshots and home video. But it can't provide the whole range of optical features that a professional video camera, or even a $1000 DSLR can. It's a matter of sensor size and light physics. 
2. Phone speakers have neither produce the range of sounds, nor the volume that large speakers in boom boxes can. (That's why external speakers are sold) Want to listen to music while playing basketball, that boombox would work, your phone not so much. Again, a matter of physics. 
3. You can't compare typing on a phone screen to that of a full size keyboard.
Products still exists to provide the full range of functionality, none of which fit in your pocket. 
Beyond that, it's a false equivalency comparing the miniaturization of microprocessors and storage technology with the problems that bitcoin faces. Many of the bitcoin problems are inherit to the technology. You can't make blockchain transactions faster or consume less energy, they are intentionally throttled. So, it will always cost as much in energy to mine bitcoin as the market will support. Faster more efficient computers just yield harder hash problems to compensate.

Read your contract. It should say right there in the TOS that they can cancel or change your service depending on what you're buying. In fact, if you spend too much $$ at strip clubs, there's a good chance you'll get canceled. It's not a moral question. You're viewed as high risk debtor. 
If you really want to do this, you can take a cash advance and buy crypto that way.

Here's a question. What percentage of your net worth do you keep in FIAT? And, is your outstanding mortgage bigger than your cashing holdings?
Because, if your mortgage (or other debts) are larger than your FIAT position, then inflation helps you too, doesn't it? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:18:52
That's fine for you. But if you expect the majority of people to act against their economic self interest to support btc for a moral good, you're going to be disappointed. 
The solution would be to create a crypto (or fix bitcoin) so it becomes a more efficient means of money exchange than paypal / venmo / credit card. At that point, people will start adopting it, and by default, start holding their savings in bitcoin. 
At that point, you have a currency. But, at this point, btc is just a libertarian dream of a post fiat world.
