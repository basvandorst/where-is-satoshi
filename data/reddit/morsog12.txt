Robinhood just announced they will be doing no fee bitcoin trading. What does this mean for bitcoin?
Edit- they will be offering free trades for about 16 different cryptos

All crypto is on an upswing right now, either way doesn’t change the game plan. HODL

What do you mean increased supply? Like in all cryptocurrencies? Or in ease of getting bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:11:05
I didn’t see that it was only for 5 states... sigh

Every time I buy there’s a significant dip right after. Am I missing something? This has been nothing but a headache for the last few months 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:44:30
Because the coins I buy instantly lower in value
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:50:38
If they instantly increased in value, I would not be posting here about my headache. And I don’t care how you word it, if I buy an asset at a certain price I will be upset if it drops significantly in value right after I purchase. I’m not sure the argument your trying to make? Even if I bought coins to use them I’m not sure how I couldn’t be upset about them lowering in value.

When did I say that I can’t handle it? My post was directed towards the people who are watching this every day thinking that it’s going to skyrocket up to previous numbers anytime soon. I’m holding for long term and buying when I can to lower my cost basis.

Credit card companies will no longer allow purchases on Coinbase without charging a cash advance fee. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:37:54
It’s 0. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:51:03
Let’s all do it
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:36:42
The bottom has and always will be 0
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:43:52
Nice lol 
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:38:43
I’m looking at gdax now, what would be the benefit of using that over Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:13:33
So now do we buy?
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:05:54
If you guys think that once this thing hits $10k there wont be a major sell off your just fooling yourselves... we have a long way until we start to see actual gains again.
EDIT: *actual gains
Edit 2: apparently I don’t know shit
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:35:33
What about 11?
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:08:01
Sixth the wow, and I’ll triple stamp your double stamp

That’s a very easy way to take no accountability for your investment. I personally like to try and analyze the data and make the most informed decisions I can. Seems like this thread is full of people who have no idea how business works. If it was just a gamble there wouldn’t be this many people on board and investing money into it. You can keep thinking that nobody has ANY IDEA where bitcoin might go, but I’ll continue to listen to people who actually try to understand the market.

Just tried to buy at 7630, purchase didn’t go through. Thought about it for a little, then sold everything I had. I’m out. It’s been fun 
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:18:08
Can someone please help me understand the ACH system and why it takes over 10 days to buy / sell bitcoin on Coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:36:04
Bottom? Look at the month chart... it’s only going down further if the trend continues. I’m not worried in the long term though
