Even if you had infinity knives, I would punch you up high in the air like a kite.

Get to the moon, look around for a minute, shrug. "Now what?"

I think these are the people that panic sell too because they apparently can't remember back more than 24 hours and that this happens basically once a week.

And on the other side, you haven't lost anything unless you sell. Unrealized gain/loss is a concept I try to hammer to people who are new to investing. I've been investing since I was 13 and I've learned to disconnect from it somewhat, but I still find myself slipping and getting upset or excited. I bought litecoin over 30 each, then it dropped near 20 and I was thinking "man I just lost so much money." Now it's well over 30 again. If I just would have not checked Coinbase for that week, I would have never felt that pain. Not that you should ignore the market but you can't get caught up in the moment to moment of it either or you'll lose your mind and make the exact opposite decisions that you should.
