how would this have been different if those guys bought their bitcoins using dollar cost averaging ? Buying and holding essentially.

thanks for pointing me to the right place! I'm ready through the FAQ sticky right now. There's some good links to information on purchasing bitcoin correctly. All the options for storage are slightly confusing though. 
Anyhow, these tips are what we need. Do you have any recommendations for beginner sites to buy BTC progressively over time?

why is this a good place to buy bitcoin? Is it suited for non techie people like us?

thank you, other comments have also recommended coinbase for beginners. I'll definitely open an account to see what it's like.


Yes, there's the howtobuybitcoin.io guide linked above with a whole section on choosing a wallet. It has the advantages/disadvantages of each type of wallet. Reading through it right now.

good to see that you also have been using this strategy. I think the hardest part of knowing how to buy bitcoin is actually knowing WHEN, and HOW MUCH. I've read these tips in books for stocks trading, and now I've seen bitcoin traders apply the same technique.

looks like a good sub to ask questions along the way, I appreciate it! 


I wish my dad and I were more IT-litterate! At least one of us could help the other in making the right software/website selection decisions. I see that there's lot's of help from the bitcoin community on reddit though :)
Are there any cryptocurrency mentor or buying bitcoin educational courses online perhaps that give you material and support over time?

Thanks, nice &amp; simple steps for buying bitcoin. I'll bookmark this. 
What's up with the payment methods though: I thought the best way to get bitcoin was with a bank transfer. I see there are quite a few methods. Do people actually use their cards to buy? I would have though this would be prohibitively expensive. Is it actually possible to purchase using PayPal?
I'm yet to read over the section with tips for choosing wallet :)

Great video, I like the relaxed paced voice and background music. But does it actually explain each step for buying bitcoin? I'd need more info on this.

thanks for the feedback. I'll check coinbase out. I've also seen other beginner users recommending it for purchasing your first bitcoins.
