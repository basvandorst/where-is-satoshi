Ha, employ native english speakers. But they all quit as soon as they realize how fucked up we are. That wouldn't be fun.

Yall motherfucking liars. Who handled it then? We all know that by feb 23rd everyone had already decided to resign. Just stop bullshitting everyone.

Yep, definitely not, other exchanges are clean as a whistle:
Oh yeah, definitely go to okcoin, they're great:
I'll add this to my list of OKCoin fuckery, the list for the uninitiated:
[OKCoin LTC market has freak crash to 1.00cny (sure the woodchipper got some good sacrifices there)](  
[OKCoin margin calls nearly every trader, promises compensation, and then doesn't actually give any compensation.](  
**[OKCoin scams users](   
[OKcoin freezes its own platform, then Margin calls its customers](  
**[Mass exodus at OKCoin, something is brewing](  
[OKCoin futures settlement issue](  
**[CZ's Statement Regarding the Dispute Between OKCoin and Roger Ver](  
[Truth Behind the Dispute Between Roger Ver and OKCoin.](   
**[Email leaks confirm OKcoin asked Roger Ver to help engage in Money Laundering, Roger refused.](  
[OKCoin no longer managing Bitcoin.com due to contract conflict with domain owner](  
**[A warning about okcoin](  
["Largest" Bitcoin Exchange Caught Faking Trades](
My favorites in bold
Some choice quotes from their ex-CTO:




I can confirm OKCoin removed a number of accounts (used by OKCoin bots) to pass the Proof-of-Reserve audit in Aug 2014. In essence, these bots trade on fractional (or fictional) reserves. Stephan Thomas was lied to during the audit. This is an unfortunate limitation of the proof-of-reserves method.
**Also Gdax doing great:**
What exactly is the deal with GDAX? 
Look at what happened just now: [Chart](
So we are selling off a bit in the market, Bitfinex drops from the 580s to 570s, and then Coinbase goes down to $475 on a wick.
This is in the background of:
* a recent fiasco relaunch of GDAX, leading to [traders being stuck](
* Randomly [banning traders](
* "Volume" to the tune of [100,000s BTC]( the kind of "creativity" we only see in China
* Constant server-related [connectivity issues]( in addition to the software issues above
**While we're at it might as well get bitstamp:**
The exchanges in bitcoin have a looooong way to grow. These problems (which admittedly are not few) are hardly limited to bitfinex.

Nope, they didn't give one out. Sorry to everyone who doesn't speak chinese.

I believe the phrase is OKCOIN REKT!
@_date: 2015-03-13 18:15:16
Why should we trust anything this exchange says? They've been proven to be liars time and time again. They say they don't fake volume but it's been proven that they do [time]( and [time]( again. 
They've been known to [scam their users]( [more proof]( and [more]( 
On top of all of this their highest profile employee, Chanpeng Zhao(CTO), [just resigned]( as well as one other guy from the international team. ~~I can't seem to find the post but it was in the other day/week~~ (edit: link is below). 
Edit: [Found it]( On Tuesday the manager of international operations and founder of the international team resigned, highest upvoted comment in the daily discussion. So with him and Chanpang leaving, that's 2/3 original okcoin international team members. I guess Chris Woods is the only one left (I'm assuming these are the first three on the international team due to them being the three people who took part in [their first AMA 8 months ago](
Edit 2: 


Considering okcoin doesn't have any American banks listed on their website, can you please tell us what bank you're using. It shouldn't compromise anything because if it's stored in the vault, merely mentioning the name of the bank wouldn't jeopardize anything. There would be thousands of branches across the "east coast". If you supply the bank name then maybe we can verify some of this and see if you're telling the truth or not.  
**Edit 3: Holy shit, check out [this post]( I've pasted it below for the lazy:
In less than 4 weeks, the following 6 high level people have left OKCoin.
Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), the high profile CTO of OKCoin, left.  CZ is well respected and trusted by the community, myself include.  Reason for leaving: “different directions”.  
Zane Tackett, International Operations Manager at OKCoin, winner of best community engagement award, left.  Reason: “different directions”
Richard Bensberg, Chief Compliance Officer at OKCoin, left.  Reason: unknown.  It’s always a big warning sign when the CCO leaves.  Richard appeared in this OKCoin AUA recently: 
Chris Woods, the Director of International Operations, left as well.  Reason unknown.  Chris appeared here.
Damian, The product designer from Alibaba mentioned in this post from the company, in fact, have left OKCoin.
Nika, Team Lead of Customer Services, the beautiful Russian speaking girl that represented OKCoin at St. Petersburg conference, has left OKCoin.
It was confirmed all of the above people left on their own, not fired.  The exact reason why they left is still not clear.  Most of them stay polite just enough to not disclose anything material.  But this sure isn’t a good sign…

I don't understand
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:21:46
Since we're dealing with a chinese company then and you claim to know the inside details 你应该会说中国话，你会吗？要不你怎么会说你了解这些公司，你跟他们普通的用户不会交流。Cause, you read the chinese news about these companies right? Talk to their average users (the chinese, not your small group of whaleclub traders), you're in the various wechat/qq groups, right?

@_date: 2015-11-10 19:49:15
Nope, I lost a little bit because I suck at trading, but i moved elsewhere because when a team goes from 12 to 2 people, two C level employees quit, the founder and director of the international team quits, the head of international customer service quits, and all of that within 2 weeks, PLUS a couple months later another C level employee (CMO, 何一）it's probably a decent sign that something isn't right. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:18:23


You just have more appetite for risk than I do. Doesn't mean one's right and one is wrong. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:44:20
Yeah, a whole different league for sure. While places like kraken, bitstamp, and bitfinex use bitgo for their cold storage, okcoin uses Star's Mom^TM, safest place to keep millions of dollars since the advent of the mattress. While bitstamp might only pump their volume a bit, the OKCoin VolumizerMAX^TM is the best around, it's built to not even let users' trades match against the exchanges. While Bitfinex might have some cascades, the OKCoin WoodChipperELITE^tm will make sure you get margin called no matter if you're long or short!


Naw, I'll just stick with exchanges that aren't actively trying to fuck over their customers. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:45:09


You guys had Chanpang Zhao listed as a co-founder. Also, the entire core of the international team did leave, the CTO, the manager of international of operations, the director of international operations, the head of customer service, the CCO. Those would be considered the core team...
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:13:30
Just because I'm observant doesn't mean I've lost a lot of money. Were you around when OKCoin's office had a protest going on outside of it because of the ridiculous circumstances regarding margin calls? You might think you know the most about these exchanges cause you've dealt with them a lot through your hangouts, but rest assured there are those that know more, I am one of them. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:58:05
No, of course it's not relevant, you just know everything there is to know about these chinese companies cause... well reasons. And yeah, i mean who cares if you can actually read what people are talking about, it's pretty useless anyway.

So you'd admit that the core international team has left then? Since this is an english website used predominantly by non-chinese, that's what we're concerned with.

But... but... but, if that's true, then they aren't so special! :(
 &gt;I know for a fact that OKCoin does not follow any of these procedures. The CEO holds the private keys, end of story.
You guys have no employees here on the west coast of USA.
Not saying you're wrong here, but I'm just curious, how do you know this?
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:41:04
How about you actually address the six people who have already left your team instead of trying to promote the one guy who’s left ([who, by the way, was fired from Kraken according to this post](

Yes, it's a technical discussion and what I'm saying is that I don't believe any of the above text. I doubt you actually use the techniques listed above to store your coins. And my point is, why should I? I can't believe you on the technical points made in my comment above (ex: volume), so what reasoning do I have to believe you for the technical points made in your post?
