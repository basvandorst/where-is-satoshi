This is terribly inflammatory for no reason. It's also short sighted. As we all know, crypto adoption affects all coins much more than individual coins move up and down by differentiating factors. For everyone in it for the long run, adoption of crypto is  Calling other coins trash is directly counterproductive, especially since they are competing on a free market and aren't coerced upon anybody.

Why is GHash.io so popular? If there is a competitor that is equally good, people will choose that over GHash because their small incentive of saving bitcoin as a whole. Otherwise they will likely stick with the best option.

But is there a way to deterministically traverse only this key space or do you have to look at a proposed key instance first to see if it's potentially valid? If so, the search space is still 256 bits.

What fucking moron is running Apple nowadays? They plain and simply shoot themselves in the foot. These short-term protectionist policies will just end up creating an enormous market for freer operating systems. A lot of people tend to take freedom seriously, and Apple should care. Heck, I love some of their products, deep down I don't even want them to fail. Or actually, maybe I do now. It truly amazes me how such a huge profitable company can act so utterly stupid.

A reminder to everyone who got rich on bitcoin: To brag about it on the public internet is about the same as withdrawing a lot of cash from an ATM in a dodgy suburb and shouting "Yay, I just made $10,000 in a lottery!". Be careful, friends.

It wasn't as bad as I thought. It was fair that he talked down cash the same way as Bitcoin. If you believe that a totalitarian society is better, that the government should have the enormous power of monitoring and controlling the citizens' financial lives; then it makes sense to reject both cash and bitcoin. I do absolutely not agree with him since the danger of an all-powerful government historically has led to much worse atrocities than free individuals, but his arguing wasn't that inconsistent, no?

I agree you can get the BTC to the organization, but if there is no way to take out the money in fiat, how is that organization paying for what they need? Heck, these days I've heard the same people advocating for tying a VISA debit card to their BTC stash. What has happened?

I have kept my eye on the Bitcoin community for years, while not being heavily involved at any point. Seeing these transaction costs, and the pavlovian responses that people present, is not only new to me, but in my opinion misguided and alarming. I chose to reply to your comment since it's the most sensible I've read here, and have actual arguments. So apologies if a little off topic, I'm basing my answer on what I've read in the thread.


Bitcoin makes very little difference as a savings account. Silver and gold have been available since the inception of human modernity, yet your average Joes don't use it to preserve value.
I'd argue that if your goal is to reduce governmental control, you cannot do it without solving the coffee problem. Why? Because the government gets their purchasing power through taxes – **human transactions** – and inflation. Not by looting people's gold savings and real estate. The average worker doesn't care about savings. They spend as much as they make. For every salary cycle, the average Joe pays half of their income for the government to spend at their discretion. Inflation and taxes on that alone is enough to sustain the military industrial complex on steroids. The currency which you pay your coffee barista with will be the same currency as you pay your military personell. As long as government leeches off your **everyday transactions**, including your salary, your rent, your mortgage payments, your clothes and ultimately, your coffee, it is business as usual as far as the government is concerned.


I agree there is a bit of novelty in that regard, but most large entities don't send money to Philippines. And sending money between many countries is easy today, though slow. What are the great use cases? Why do they make a huge difference?

A few years ago it was all about how Apple was the worst lock-in platform because they decided who could launch an app. Every cool crypto kid on the block hated Apple for this reason, and even more so when they were slow at approving crypto apps of course. Interesting how things have changed -- except Apple is still the bad guy. Maybe the BTC community needs a little introspection here.
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:39:46
This is gonna get nothing but downvotes because I'm gonna be swearing in church, but *some of this community* has an extremely naive attitude towards trust. First there was so much fuzz about Apple not approving Bitcoin wallets and the conspiracy was obviously that they were afraid of competition. Now that they approve crypto apps left and right the conspiracy is that Apple approves malicious wallets to discredit Bitcoin. First of all, that Apple is trying to keep out competition, is bullshit -- but even if it was true, if that's all it takes to tank the entire currency, that currency has a huge problem by itself whether it's digital or not.
Go back a few years, when putting a client on your phone was not even considered. Cold storage and the likes was supposed to protect you from fraud. If you didn't inspect the source code for your client you were insta-blamed for your lost coins. But there was no way you could get your grandma and uncle to use some weird cold storage machine anyway, so there had to be smartphone clients, web clients, simple ways of USD to BTC etc, etc. Availability is critical for a currency (no explanation needed).
I am not a heavy bitcoin user myself, I'll admit, but I have been following the development since the early days. And the way people use bitcoin in practice changes all the time despite the protocol staying the same. (For instance -- the cool wallet at the time, Hive, for OSX was discontinued and didn't work when I updated OSX, so I had to manually extract the private key to another client.) This is all fine I guess for an experimental currency for techies. But when you start blaming third party actors for introducing trust issues you are being insanely naive. **You had no way of ensuring trust for non-tech-savvy users in the first place, so what are you bitching about?** Currencies are **always** target for fraud -- traditional currencies even more. It is the very nature of a currency to hold value, and people will always try to make a cheap buck from that. You need to design with that in mind *always, always, always*.
Believe me, there is nothing I'd like more than for a non-FIAT currency to take off among non-techies and fanboys, but if we don't acknowledge the reality of the situation there is no way the problem will just go away -- on the contrary, bad guys will target it more the more it grows.

Upvote for important issue! Convenience and simplicity for customer payment is extremely important for bitcoin as a currency in physical stores/restaurants/retailers etc. Nobody will go through lots of tech hassle to pay for a sandwich, yet it is the most important aspect of bitcoin's future: paying for random (cheap or not) stuff in random places quick and easy.

Ah ok, well it all comes down to the government, doesn't it. It obviously sucks ass but I would not expect anything less from the government. They will – naturally – do whatever they can to maintain control over the economy in every way possible; with or without this guy in particular.
