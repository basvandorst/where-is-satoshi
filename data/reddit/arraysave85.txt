I have emailed BFX directly regarding this as well. Awaiting a reply.

Sure, so an example - 
1 peso was artificially pegged to 1 usd in 2001. By the end of 2002, that 1 peso is now only worth about 0.30 cents in US dollars. The peso effectively lost ~70% of its value against the dollar during at period. 
When this happens people often want to store their wealth in assets which are priced in other currencies. Gold is a common safe haven asset for example and is usually priced in US dollars per ounce. Bitcoin serves a similar purpose. 
Imagine you buy a loaf of bread for 4 peso in January, and by December the price is now 8 pesos, but your wages haven't doubled in the meantime. You've effectively halved your salary due to inflation. That's why black market operators spring up all the time, accepting US dollars for goods and services because they know it's going to be worth roughly the same amount in a years time.
The above example is entirely contrived, but this kind of hyperinflation occurs from time to time and is currently happening in Venezuela with their currency, the bolivar. -

The main barriers in my opinion to mass vendor adoption has always been;
* transaction fees
* slow confirmations
* lack of widespread payment provider support due to the first two points
Segwit activation will give the network additional capacity, as well as allow the off-chain/sidechain scaling for certain use cases (i.e. lightning network)
I hold bitcoin, but i also use my coins to pay bills on livingroomofsatoshi.com. The confirmation times of a couple of minutes doesn't really come into play when using services like that online. It wouldn't really work in a supermarket for your weekly shop right now.
I think there is a distinction to be made between selling and spending my coins. Selling my coins on an exchange to another Bitcoiner doesn't really increase the overall awareness of bitcoin or help to bring it into the mainstream. Encourage vendors and shops you regularly visit to accept bitcoin, spread the word and support businesses that accept bitcoin.

 good question! I don't know what would happen in that situation but I'll try to find out
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:09:17
appreciate the reply, thanks for linking those.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:07:05
I see what you did there!
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:30:55
agreed, unfortunately that is the nature of the beast that is bitcoin.
maybe one day we wont have to care about fiat and we simply just use BTC everywhere :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:16:12
I get you. Just slowly replace your coins over time. Nothing wrong with spending your coin to support the businesses accepting bitcoin. 
They too are early adopters.

thanks, edited my post a touch. I didn't want to misquote the original poster but I can see that it might have been unclear

also, as users who want to conduct micro-transactions move onto LN, more space is available to those users who still want to transact on chain.

no you wont in BTC-per-byte terms. less people bidding for the same space in the next block, you can make the argument that fee-per-byte will actually go down. 
people who quote fees in terms of dollars are being a little bit disingenuous. fees can go down and it's still possible to pay more in US dollar terms if the price of BTC is increasing. this is why all wallets quote in BTC per byte, not dollars.

Good to see the community supporting the businesses that are taking a risk and accepting bitcoin! Enjoy your (tasty) profit.
Also, those ribs look awesome :D

you dont have to open a payment channel with everyone, you could open a channel with AcmePaymentsInc, and they will have channels to other third parties and merchants. Payments can be routed between providers.
This can lead to big centralised payment hubs, but you dont have to use LN if you dont want to. you can still transact on the blockchain like to normally do. It's simply another option.
You can also open your own payment channel between you and your buddy and transact instantly and freely.
see this video for an example of a working wallet on the bitcoin testnet -

miners have to pay their bills, which they will do by selling their coin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:59:18
In my opinion yes, but ask yourself, If Bitcoin drops another 10%, or even 20%, can I still afford to hold?
For the record, I bought another 0.04 at $3860, but the price is going to be volatile for a while. Never risk more than you can afford to lose.

note the word *essentially* ... he's not being literal 
maybe a video on an actual LN wallet will ease your concerns - 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:36:03
this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:11:24
It should also be noted that you dont HAVE to use LN if you dont want to; it's simply another option. 
You can still transact on-chain like you always have.

My first buy was for $50. I decided I would be more inclined to read the news and understand the technology if I had some skin in the game, so to speak. 
Do you need that $50 right now for rent/food/school? If not then go for it
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:39:33
You can use it for both purposes already I think. If you using bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluation of your local currency (i.e. Venezuela, Greece) then I think you can argue that's an investment.

you can open a payment channel between two parties. Both sides make commitments i.e. i agree to put in .1btc, you agree to put in .1btc - when you open the channel a transaction on-chain is created. 
once the channel is created you can effectively send coins back and forth between the two parties instantly and with low/zero fees. the balances in the channel are not reflected on the blockchain until you close the channel. When you're done transacting with the other party, you close the channel. this creates a transaction on-chain.
your best bet is to watch this video, it gives you a good idea of how it works with this particular LN wallet -

BCH is planning to fork, to remove the EDA and replace it on the 13th of November. So the massive difficulty increase may not happen.

i've used Coinbase to create small weekly purchases of BTC without issue. You can check a box when purchasing coins to repeat the purchase at set intervals.
