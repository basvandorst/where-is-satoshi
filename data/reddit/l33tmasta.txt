That’s cool, they just won’t give you the opportunity to buy, thus freeing up stock for people that actually want to use the cards for what they’re designed for instead of mining fake worthless garbage.

Wow. I know I'm arrogant and self-centered, but even I can't honestly believe that you think any of that applies to BitCoin.

That control is what provides a consistent and fast user experience. It's what allows them to have close to zero malware/virus issues. It's what allows them to outperform the competitors on what others would consider to be "inferior hardware". 
I also find your claim that Apple locked out your charger and they charge more for their chargers to "pad their bottom line" laughable. You obviously don't know the tech in the charger cables. They have a WHOLE GOD DAMN FUCKING SOC IN THEM. You know, tiny computers? They have a required level of security on even the smallest of things, like their charge cable. Not only that but it regulates the power flow to the pins and doesn't provide any power to them until the cord is fully plugged in to prevent shorting, and a whole slew of other things. [Here's a full article on the benefits of the lightning cable and it's SoC if you'd like to educate yourself]( 
Now as for why they locked your cheap god damn shitty knockoff unlicensed garbage cable out, [HERE'S WHY!]( So long story short: to protect you.
But, fuck Apple, right?

Here, have some DogeCoin and chill the fuck out.

You'll never convince anyone that actually matters that your fake internet money is actually a viable currency lol

From 5.5+ years of cellphone industry experience I can tell you that it's not up for debate. 
[The iPhone 5S is faster than all the brand name quad-core Android devices currently available](
[There are over 10 MILLION compromised Android Apps and hackers are expected to target Bitcoin transactions in 2014](
[80% of iOS devices are on iOS 7 already, Just 1.4% of Android users run KitKat](
[Jim Richardson from National Geographic praising the iphone 5S' camera]( 
I could go on if you'd like.

How do I become as ignorant as you? Does it take practise?
@_date: 2014-02-27 09:09:08
I'm sorry I hurt your feeling with my cursing.

Many apologies.

I wouldn't necessarily say I drank the Koolaid. At the point I started to become interested in Apple mobile devices I was already 12 years deep in to the PC world. I'm a power user and love the devices, but I refuse to have a Mac desktop.
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:45:26
No you can't. The iPhone 5S had the best camera available (don't quote megapixels or I'll laugh at you even harder), and its dual core 1.3GHz CPU beats out quad core 2.3GHz processors used in the LG G2 and the Nexus 5. On top of that all those other fun things like viruses (ON YOUR GOD DAMN PHONE AND TABLET) are a huge issue with Android. 99% of all mobile malware was targeted at Android last year.

[This alone proves that they weren't in it for profit, or they'd have left their fees higher]( They're strictly a quality control thing. It's been said time and time again that the fee is in place to control the rampant issue with faulty 3rd party cables causing issues by providing too much power, [installing unauthorized software via the cable]( and worst of all, death. Like I said, I actually sell, troubleshoot and support these devices and handle more of them in a day than you will in your lifetime. 


I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you over how fast my phone performs while not slowing down over time. If you want a [virus riddled malware machine]( that is vulnerable to an [exploit that puts all BitCoin wallet apps at risk]( [slower than an iPhone]( [has a horrible fragmentation and adoption rate issue]( and [copies the iPhone to the point of being taken to court and losing the battle]( then be my guest.


Hahaha oh man my sides! Shit, that's funny. 
I think it's time to grow up, kid. I bet you call Microsoft M$, right? Kindly read up and learn about this stuff if you're going to post again, and come back when you can back up anything you say.
EDIT: Just realized I didn't laugh at you specifically for this:


HAHAHAHAHA! I even posted a link to an article that told you all the benefits. You really are bad at this.

I was the biggest Apple hater growing up. Bought an alternative MP3 player instead of an iPod, turned 18 and imported a Zune instead of getting an iPod. Hated their OS, their ideas, mocked the fact that they were overpriced and very locked down with no customization of hardware (I love building PCs). Then I saw something when I watched Steve Jobs introduce the first iPhone. I saw a device that would change the way we used our phones. I saw a device that would be the mold for everything that followed. And it did. People will argue until they're blue in the face that all this stuff existed before, but that doesn't matter. It didn't exist in that configuration. The look in his eye and the confidence I heard in his voice made me excited. So excited that I imported and hard wired an original iPhone to be unlocked. Then the 3G changed everything again with a faster phone, an App Store, and a faster data connection. I've slowly warmed up to the ecosystem and ideas behind the Apple systems. I've upgraded my iPhone every year, bought a MacBook Air in the summer, and an iPad Mini. By far Apple accelerates in the portable market, but I still prefer my Windows PC for home use.

Will you guys be supporting DogeCoin anytime soon?
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:43:50
All I saw was a huge market force lose a bury load of coins and ruin peoples lives. 
Cry more BitCoin users. Cry more. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:11:13
No, I glanced over the rest of the nonsense about BitCoin. That was the only point that really had any meaning. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:35:47
Or, you know, the people that actually want a powerful device that's better built, more secure, faster, better supported, and virus free. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:09:32
Diehard? Maybe in the mobile sector. I sell the phones and tablets you're talking about and the one here with the disconnect is you. You claim that all Apple hardware is crap, yet  their device perform better with what is actually less power. Their App Store policy keeps devices that you use everyday in every facet of your life secure and stable. They lead the smartphone revolution and caused a whole shift in the way that smartphones were modelled, so much so that Samsung directly copied their design and were sued for it. They made the tablet an everyday device instead of something that was only the thing of dreams and scifi. 
So in short everything about your post is ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:50:45
Different technology completely. One required a swipe of the finger while the other is just placing it on top of a reader. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:45:44
So you bought an inferior phone to use a fake made up currency?
