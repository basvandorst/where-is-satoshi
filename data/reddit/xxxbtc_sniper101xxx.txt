Sitting here just reading posts on rbitcoin I honestly did not expect to burst into laughter. +1 internets for you kind sir!

there are technically illiterate people around here who, thanks to dumb analogies, believe they suddenly have acquired technical knowledge (most of rbtc). 
You are right, all analogies are flawed and therefore any analogy that puts SW in an advantageous light is just as valid as one that does so for BU. Technical details are what decides the validity of the agenda the analogy is supposed to push. There is no way around technical details. 
Also VOIP was a downgrade in comparison to isdn. High overhead, high latency, terrible QoS. VOIP was a business driven decision not a consumer driven one. Making this analogy perfectly flawed because, just as with Bitcoin, consumers have no flipping idea about VOIP.

Like most people around Ver; Erik has a big mouth with nothing to back it up when the tough questions are asked.

You can't negotiate with contrarians. They will oppose everything you do for the sake of opposing you: ["core needs to be gotten rid of"](


The technical debate that has been raging for years has never been about finding a compromise. It has been about determining the best way forward. Pieter Wuille's SW proposal  was instantaneously accepted by a overwhelming majority of developers the second they heard about it. The day it was presented along with a SF option was celebrated as **the** breakthrough.
Contrarians had to bitch about how it would take years to implement and test. Now that it is implemented and tested they complain about how it's not enough and how it has to be a HF. You will never appease them.

If chinese miners unilaterally decided to make the block reward 'flexible' would that also be in the best interest of businesses and exchanges to adopt?
Hell will freeze over before I hand over control over the ability to run a full node to miners.

And the last presidential elections in the USA were a clown show. Humanity is revolting. Nothing new.

Ver advocates for "decentralized development" (a non existent, undefined and irrelevant concept). At the same time however, he needs an overwhelming **majority** of miners and economically valuable full nodes to adopt his premined shitcoin client so that he can "safely upgrade" (hard fork) the Bitcoin protocol.
How can people be so damn stupid not to realize that either we get a myriad of consensus incompatible clients who never enforce their incompatible rules. Or we all run BU and hand over protocol development to a closed handful of subpar developers and their president.

tldr: 20 major exchanges agree not to list BTU/XBU altcoin unless BU developers implement proper replay attack protections.
Exchanges taking a stand is a breath of fresh air imo

Threads like this are the reason we have rbtc. Either make an attempt at learning the inner workings of Bitcoin or don't. But don't pretend you know things based on hand waving and stupid analogies you read somewhere.

Monkeys throw feces at humans because they discover that it's the easiest way of getting a strong reaction from us. It makes them feel in control. 
Sure some people will not hesitate to throw the feces back, but it doesn't change the fact that rbtc is full of illiterate, shit slinging monkeys.

Do not listen to anybody!

Exchanges are forcing BU to finally legitimize and substantiate their project. 
The demands made are perfectly reasonable and if BU doesn't want to seem like it's faltering they will have to comply. 
It will be interesting to see how this plays out. Bitcoin Extreme is already taken so the next contrarian project will have to come up with a different name and concept all together.
