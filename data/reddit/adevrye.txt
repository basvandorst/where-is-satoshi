Ponzi Scheme “Red Flags”
Many Ponzi schemes share common characteristics. Look for these warning signs:
High returns with little or no risk. Every investment carries some degree of risk, and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspicious of any “guaranteed” investment opportunity.
Overly consistent returns. Investments tend to go up and down over time. Be skeptical about an investment that regularly generates positive returns regardless of overall market conditions.
Unregistered investments. Ponzi schemes typically involve investments that are not registered with the SEC or with state regulators. Registration is important because it provides investors with access to information about the company’s management, products, services, and finances.
Unlicensed sellers. Federal and state securities laws require investment professionals and firms to be licensed or registered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individuals or unregistered firms.
Secretive, complex strategies. Avoid investments if you don’t understand them or can’t get complete information about them.
Issues with paperwork. Account statement errors may be a sign that funds are not being invested as promised.
Difficulty receiving payments. Be suspicious if you don’t receive a payment or have difficulty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent participants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying put.   &lt;——— AKA HODL

You can’t judge a person and everything they’ve achieved based on what you interpret as a Freudian slip. The man has a weird sense of humour.

One of bitcoins most valuable assets is the people using them, 
Exactly. HODL is not a use
“Understanding Utility and Value
Utility is the economic term for satisfaction. A basic economic insight is human beings act purposefully to satisfy wants or to remove discomfort. The more utility an item has, the more value human beings are willing to assign to it. In this way, utility can be synonymous with subjective human value. However, utility is not the same thing as market value, which is expressed in dollars, because utility is personal and market value is aggregated and impersonal.
For example, if a toy company increases its marginal value by boosting its economies of scale, this has nothing to do with an individual's marginal utility. Here, marginal value just means an incremental increase in market value.”

I shouldn’t have to explain to you why a house is not a ponzi.
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:03:16
Segwit removed the digital signature trail. This is in the whitepaper and is part of the core design. You are right though “the core design is not “cores design”
Cores design is no longer bitcoin

There is no value to your system of buying btc holding some, spending some and replacing it. That’s all needless bank fees and exposure to volatility. Normal people don’t do that. 
As to your question : read the definition of ponzi that this whole argument started with
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:40:50
Lol you obviously do or you wouldn’t have replied with personal insult. See you in 6 months!
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:08:25
Lol flattering but no CSW doesn’t use social media especially the bottom of the barrel platforms used for social disinformation campaigns

“with Segwit, the signatures do not directly provide a linkage from one transaction to the next, which is why they are said to be “outside the chain of transactions”
I’m not taking about the ability to validate I’m talking about the ability to audit.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:05:15
Segwit removes the signature data from the transaction, meaning no audit trail to follow. Protocol altered
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:57:40
If you mean the entire crypto space then yes I agree the entire crypto space is a ponzi. Only tokens that have an actual utility could be considered different
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:28:59
Omg how about the whitepaper! Or, read direct quotes from the man himself satoshi Nakamoto. Loop shouldn’t be taken as an authority on the subject
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:03:13
Lol get with the times dude ver stepped down and bch doesn’t follow the whitepaper anymore either
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:01:13
If you’re referring to the comments below, they’re all trash. Spewing and regurgitating the same narrative back and forth.  Wake up, you’re being manipulated into perpetuating the Ponzi scheme

“The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of. [...] The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we’ll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later."
- Satoshi Nakamoto 
BTC is the one that forked off with the segwit “upgrade”. Removing signature data is a direct shift away from the whitepaper itself.  Now that bch is also adding segwit bch has also forked off from the whitepaper. Only one chain remains true to satoshis design.... it’s not btc or bch.
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:28:06
Wow nice quote which means literally nothing. Guess what Ian Grigg creator of the Ricardian contract just cited the whitepaper in his new article AND Craig Wright is cited as the author.
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:48:37
There should be no authority on the subject other then the creator himself. So much for “decentralized”
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:20:07
You are right bcash isn’t bitcoin either. Can you guess which coin is trying to fit the description? Hint: the genesis upgrade in January 2020 will revert this coins protocol back to 0.1 as described in the whitepaper
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:17:26
If bsv is dead then btc and bch are rotting corpses. Bsv has 87% of transactions today as well as 80.7% of blocksize
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:35:01
You don’t have to obey anything. Go create your own digital currency and make whatever rules you want. You can’t use the name bitcoin if you don’t follow bitcoins whitepaper.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:50:33
Lol I can’t argue with ignorance, good luck dude.
@_date: 2019-08-05 13:04:20
There’s no underlying value to something that can be replicated.  Look at Venezuela’s currency, it’s basically garbage now.  There are many different forks of BTC what makes one valuable and one not? Most people will say the hash power securing the network makes it valuable, well hash power will only stick around as long as it makes economic sense. There’s no loyalty to the chain it’s all business.
Not sure what you mean by day jobs being a ponzi.  My description of ponzi is copy and pasted from a government website btw.
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:17:59
It’s really not that hard to move from one to the next. Buy 10k raspberry pi’s, convince people that you know best and whalla! You control protocol changes and “upgrades”
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:37:23
Go study some basic entry level economics.

HODL is literally the opposite of using something. 
And this is the reason why btc is 11
More damning is the allegation that the companies “loaned tethers to a New York trading firm.” As we reported last month, large “whales” can purchase high volumes of tethers directly, communicating their needs days in advance. Tether then creates these tethers, which it claims it only disperses once wire payments for each coin have come through. But if Tether indeed “loaned” tethers to investors, it suggests the enormous volumes of tethers that have attended almost every recent Bitcoin price surge represent not real dollars but debt—meaning tethers have, effectively, been minted out of thin air. 
Now combine all that with every other description of a ponzi that btc fits.  You’re really going to try to tell me that btc isn’t a ponzi?
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:05:33
It is a Ponzi scheme, it’s just masked very well behind the veil of “new technology”
@_date: 2019-08-06 12:28:41
As I said before. Can’t argue with ignorance, good luck dude
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:19:11
You’re not understanding what I’m saying. There is no difference between forks other then perceived value. Unless there’s a fork with a coin that has utility....I wonder which fork that is.

“in Segwit, we still have the signature, but it is NOT required to be directly included in the input of the transaction. In fact, it’s explicitly excluded for the purposes of eliminating malleability. Instead, the signature (“witness data”) is placed elsewhere in its own special section. We still have the data, but what we DON’T have is the data integrity check since it’s not necessary to have the complete transaction (including the signatures) the next time the coin is spent.”

The technology itself is public domain at this point so the btc coin itself doesn’t have any inherent value.  It relies on a brand name

You do not upgrade the underlying protocol of the internet. You build applications ONTOP of the base protocol. There’s no reason to change it, ESPECIALLY if all the changes do is weaken the integrity of the system.

Don’t care for bcash. But guess what? Bsv will follow whitepaper to the letter starting January 2020 when the genesis upgrade unfucks the protocol

“Satoshis design allowed change. Any derivative of the original design is still off of his design.”
How much clearer does satoshis direct quote need to be to make you understand the the protocol design is NOT SUPPOSE TO CHANGE
