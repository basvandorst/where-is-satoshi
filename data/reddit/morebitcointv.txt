The problem with SMS services is that they are expensive and susceptible to abuse, and on the whole - unprofitable. Changetip is in a good position to enable SMS but it will be largely operated at a loss. 37coins solved this problem, but integrating it into changetip could prove challenging, 37coins's solution was to push the cost out to individual operators that ran on android phones with the option of charging a operator determined fee. SMS services require a large educated user base to remain profitable, which for the time being is not the case.

Just post one of the long codes on your site, should look something like this:
"Donate BTC: 1E7wHmU8qSd6PdtyBP4YA1R42cN1pQLGSy"
You could also post the long code into a QR code generator and save the image, then people can just scan it and donate.

If bitcoin is a success then the transaction volume would be massive, thus making the transaction fees attractive to collect. The network is dynamic in the sense that it doesn't matter how many machines are hashing, if more computers are added to the network then the difficulty of mining/validating gets harder, likewise if computers leave the network then the difficulty adjusts to make mining easier, always aiming for a 10 minute confirmation time. So in theory, 1 computer could run the bitcoin network or 10,000,000. The confirmation time will always be 10 minutes. If the fees are not enough for everyone to mine then people will start dropping out until it hits a point where people are satisfied with their returns from transactions fees.

No you look at the current bids, because a bid is the price people are willing to pay for your bitcoin, like how they would bid for an auction on ebay. That's if you want to sell your coin right away, but if you are willing to hold out and ask for more money for your bitcoin then you would create a sell order and ASK for more than the current bids.

False. I could ask for $2000 and it wont go though immediately, if you want to fill an order immediately you would look at the current bids. If you create an order for the current ask price there is no guarantee that your order will ever be filled. OP is trying to sell, not buy. If they were trying to buy then you would be correct.

I think big B Bitcoin is the network and little b bitcoin is the currency, I've seen people use both but interchangeably though. Also mining isn't worth going too much into detail, its a very nuts and bolts conversation and pretty distracting.

In the accounts tab, select the account with the positive balance, what options does that give you? If you hold it down or something?

In android, not sure about IOS:
- In Mycelium go to settings and enable expert mode.
- Exit settings and go to keys tab and select the public key with the balance
- Press the additional options tab, and select export
This will present you with your private key for that public key, you can copy it to clipboard and import it somewhere else, or scan it with another device.

Sorry I'm not familiar with the ios app, I'm looking it up and looking for an answer for you. Is there a keys tab? Try the other steps, or maybe there is a similar option for expert mode, like advanced mode, developer mode, etc.

Then the value of bitcoin would reflect that, and their funds would be more traceable then they are today, assuming they are dealing with large blocks of funds. Constant buying pressure from printing money to buy bitcoin on the open market would just create an incentive people to save in bitcoin. If they bought it up just to dump it all really fast and try and crash the price it wouldn't accomplish much other than getting a bunch of other people rich in the process.

Yikes, well, don't delete it. Keep trying to send it somewhere would be my final bit of advice.

Can't print bitcoins out of thin air, price will run up, and we'll all be stinkin rich. After that happens then they can't manipulate the money supply like they do with dollars.

Use cash, 
Paypal is useless, it can be reversed easily so no one accepts it.
