Scrolled down the page a bit. What's up with all the haters? I SAY GO MAN GO!

Let's not make Bitcoin more confusing and intimidating to newcomers/tech-illiterates than it already is. 'Bits' is not a good option.
I really prefer 'Satoshi' to 'Bitcoin', and since we're already further towards the 'Satoshi'-end of the spectrum, why not base the name off Satoshi instead?
100 satoshi could be called a 'Satoshi Dollar' or 'Satoshi Pound', for example.
Or why not 'Satoshi Sovereign*', as an homage to the free future, a place so close to us now, filled with wonder and ease!
(* Sovereigns were pound coins that contained real gold. They stopped being produced after England dropped the gold standard.)

As i see it: The US government is crippling this new technology by trying to fit it into an old system that wasn't built for bitcoin. You don't really need to be a libertarian to disobey a rule like this.
It's really pretty easy to stay below the radar, just don't cash trade your BTC for fiat. As more and more companies or even nations start trading in bitcoin, you won't need to.

I see where you're coming from. I can really get put off by people "selling revolution".
But at the same time I see two parallel trends: The militarisation of the Internet from governments, and the emerging technologies that will reduce the need/bypass current political and legal frameworks of society. These two developments are probably heading for a front end collision. The great conflict of the century may very well turn out to be between statist reactionaries and those in favor of political transcendence through the tools of cryptography.
The challenge we're facing is to foster a language and conduct that isn't conformist and doesn't downplay the sociopolitical potential of crypto. But at the same time isn't intimidating or over-confrontational. Or worse, naive and pseudo-revolutionary.
There are lessons to be learned from the mistakes of anonymous, the pirate bay and wikileaks, who didn't handle public relations very well. The Bitcoin fight is obviously less infected for the moment. But considering the legal interventions during the heydays of file sharing, I do think we're in for a bumpy ride.
Edit: Btw, I don't think you necessarily have to be an anarchist to see government intervention as a threat. Just in the same way as we value free and independent journalism as a pre-requisite for a legitimate democracy, we can also value a free and independent internet for the same reasons. The REAL potential of decentralized technologies are beyond the nation state-paradigm though. If that road leads to anarchy or something else is still an unwritten page.

IMO Google are the best at UI right now. Wish more could be said for Reddit.
Edit: Btw, you're wrong about having a nice ui being the most important. Building the social snowball effect that's necessary to acheive momentum is the hard part. Getting early adopters.

It's not like the protocol would improve by replacing the decimal system with a bunch of strings. This is a question of 'lingo'. It will emerge in time from the social interactions of the community, as all language does. As soon as a certain word gains momentum I'm sure everyone will be happy to use it.

Ironically, here's a good TED-talk about what's wrong with TEDology.

This is cool. I'm a front end dev/designer by trade. Looking forward to building an interface :) I like the idea of having multiple interfaces for the same backend, IRC nostalgia :) Good work!

It's all or nothing. Either the network will never gain sufficient momentum to reach mainstream adoption and its value slowly whither away. Or it will become the international currency of the internetz and reinvent finance as we know it. It definitely has the potential for the latter. The biggest threat is a better crypto currency coming along. Or leviathan, but many states seem to regard Bitcoin with a curiously positive attitude.

They are the same thing aren't they? Someone accepting BTC is someone earning it by selling you something.

Ted Nelson is the creator of hypertext, which was the first step toward the creation of the internet. I've also heard also coined the word teledildonics. A true pioneer of IT and modern computer science.

At the same time, swedish exchange Safello is setting it's sights on becoming the Coinbase of Europe. Why are they getting away? Probably because they have nice design.
Just proves how arbitrary and void these "security measures" are.

Stop posting this stupid crap, zero content.

People. You NEED TO STOP talking about OpenBazaar as the new Silk Road. OpenBazaar is an open source decentralized trading platform. It is NOT tailored towards illegal markets.
You're getting the developers into a lot of trouble, and potentially sabotaging a very promising application.

A lot of people know WHAT bitcoin is (sort of), but few have realized it's WHY it's such a big deal. This is a great introduction to bitcoin.

Give em a chance. I think ethereum is a serious attempt at making a generalised blockchain. The ether sale proves they already have some momentum. I'm looking forward to the launch.

yeah, stefan talks about a wide range of subjects, many are much more controversial than bitcoin. a lot of martyrdom here. i'm sure it's just some copyright thing.

So, let's codify.
Why: Freedom
How: By taking the financial tools from bankers and governments and handing them to the people.
What: Bitcoin.

If short term price drops make you nervous, then you obviously don't believe in the technology. And if you don't blieve in the technology, then you're not investing - you're gambling.
Bitcoin is an "all or nothing"-technology. Either it will lose it's whole value, or it will become widely adopted (doubling the value many times over). The odds are looking good, but you can never be sure. Investing money into something you don't believe in is totally irrational.
Being in over your head is also irrational. Don't invest more than you're w... yadiyadiya.

Why is this happening? It's skyrocketed for the past few days. Any initiating event?
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:54:30
I've contemplated this myself. I think the shopping experience could be streamlined immensely with bitcoin vs cards. And it's a good way entry for people to aquire BTC.

I also have a background in UX, and I don't necessarily agree.
First of all, QR codes are alive and well. Sure, people don't have general purpose QR readers in their phones for the reasons stated above. But QR still has a legitimate use is cases where it actually makes sense. Sure, QR as a "cool thing" in tacky marketing campaigns is dead, but a more pragmatic usage has taken it's place.
Furthermore, from a UX point a view, there's a great myth that you should clear the way as much as possible for the user. It's a good rule of thumb, but the user still wants to feel in control. I would definitely prefer having a payment solution where I as a customer gets to finalize the payment and commit to my purchase. Spending my money "in the background" isn't intuitive at all, it's actually quite worrying.
Another aspect is of course UX for the merchant. One of the most empowering things for merchants right now is how easy it is to set up Bitcoin payment compared to taking credit cards etc. I'm sure an app targeted towards merchants could solve this (iZettle is a great example). The point is stay within in known waters. The merchants have already taken a leap in accepting a weird digital currency, they don't necessarily need to have next-gen wireless technologies thrown into the mix.
That being said, I think exchanging public adresses via Bluetooth sounds great in a lot of cases. Maybe other usages too. But I still think people want to be the one turning the key - a clear and distinct action from _their part_ that seals the deal.

Everyone who claims to be invested in Bitcoin: Donate a small amount to this. This is not only fucking awesome and a good addition to the infrastructure - putting a sat into orbit, especially if community funded, will bring a lot of credibility and attention to Bitcoin. If this happens, it will be front page news all over the world.
