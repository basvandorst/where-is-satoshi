Welcome to the world of Bitcoin investors.

This is a tad bit delusional
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:29:51
Dude you still haven't learned that you don't know what you're doing when trading anything.

Good God the stupidity of the Bitcoin community is mind blowing

People always say the USD isn't backed by anything when in fact it is backed by the most powerful force known to man: the US military. China et al will never margin call the US on our debt because of our military, other reasons too as it will fuck up the global economy. The only time they will is if the end times are nigh and if you believe those times are near take your tin foil hat and gtfo.

I hate the meme culture around here but good damn this is a good one. I mostly have the culture because there are too many just OK memes upvoted to the top. This is one that I admire.

Because it's only gonna go lower.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:43:49
This is terrible logic
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:49:35

The only way institutions will get involved is via passive funds.
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:35:02
They'll never go active, mainly because nobody knows which coins will survive.
