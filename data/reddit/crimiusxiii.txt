Gotcha.  I don't have much experience using them with a debit card.  I setup a bank account specifically for Coinbase and only add money that's already earmarked for bitcoins.  Without a card attached to it, it usually takes about 5 business days for coins to appear, and 10-15 after selling for the cash to appear in the account again.  Multiple weeks of runaround on a purchase is definitely out of the ordinary.  Sorry for your loss :(

Absolutely.  Nearly every one of those things listed can be done by someone unable to code.

Please provide some details here.  Thousands use coinbase.com daily with no incident, so what about your situation is unique such that they simply took your money?

This could be a downside, for an adult company.  I'm sure it varies by country, but in most areas you need to at least check a box that you are over the age of majority.  Sometimes, a credit card is proof of this.

Hi Jimmy.
Since it seems like others are acknowledging, if not addressing some of your expressed concerns, I'd just like to welcome you to the bitcoin community!

I feel like we've heard this song and dance before somewhere.

Right here baby!

Bought 5+ around $190 a piece.  Feeling just fine.

Indeed, he seems to have fixed it though.  I'll edit my response away ;)

EDIT: Fixed his post, and thus made mine nonsensical.

Simple actually looks pretty slick.  Signing up.

The whole free thing has been mentioned, as has the poitn that the people using bitcoin are aware of the free porn, so I'll take i ta different route.
As you said, there's really only that one site that gets mentioned.  As a result, it isn't really proven to the porn industry yet.  I also think that many camgirls might be reluctant to sign up for a site that accepts payment in a form they don't really comprehend.  While many camgirl sites already use some form of virtual currency (tokens, bux, etc...), they have a fixed USD value attached to them, which provides some security.  I'm not saying the site would not pay performers in USD (or Bitcoin if that's what they wanted), but would you sign up to perform for a site who's unique hook was something completely foreign to you?
I think the key to bitcoin in the adult market would be to target the third party payment processors, like CCBill or Epoch, and get them to incorporate it into their packages.
I also think that it could be as simple as nobody's done it (properly) yet, too. :)
