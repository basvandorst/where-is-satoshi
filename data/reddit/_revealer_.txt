The main issue is that as it is called BIP, people think it is a inter-wallet standard, which is not the case. 
what you describe in the last paragraph does not sound like a 'relax!' situation at all, and could lead to loss of funds. Especially let's say, in a few decades if you are trying to restore a seed that has funds only on a deprecated derivation format, and does not have written with it information about which wallet was used to create it or a derivation path. 
Awareness is necessary, and arguably standardization too.

Energy consumption is different that an energy-value system, to which he was an advocate. this is a compliment to PoW.

there is a good chance that it won't. Seed phrases are not standardized or inter-wallet operable. BIP39 derivation paths  from old formats might be deprecated and probably won't be implemented by newer wallets. Write the software and year you used to generate the seed, that will probably make it 'work' in the most futures.

TDLR: Bitcoin will replace all the world’s wildly intervarying, opinion-gambled-upon, top-power-system-manipulatable monetary systems. It will do away with the top economic power structure’s banker-invented, international balance-of-trade accountings. It will eliminate all the tricky banking and securities-markets exploitations in operation today. It will end the nation state and foster the design science revolution.

yes, the keys are offline. The watching only wallet will verify the transactions with SPV, so it is impossible for the servers to lie. Their cold storage guide is quite easy: 
If you want better privacy then run your own EPS (Electrum Personal Server  and connect only to it.

There is another passage about oil and why it is not suitable for such system:
 "The computer will also have verified both of the important findings of the brilliant Denver, Colorado, oil geologist, Frangois de Chardenedes: (1) the script of his scenario of “Nature’s Production of Petroleum,’’ and (2) his economic findings regarding the amount of energy employed as heat and pressure, for the length of time initially that it took nature to photosynthetically process Sun radiation into the myriad of hydrocarbon molecules that comprise all the vegetation and algae, which later are consumed and growthfully multiplied by a myriad of other biological species, a large percentage of which Sun-energy-nurtured-and-multiplied molecules are ultimately processed into petroleum. 
The script of de Chardenedes’s “Scenario of Petroleum Production” 
makes it clear that, with all that cosmic-energy processing (as rain, wind, 
and gravitational pressure) and processing time (paid for at the rates you 
and I pay for household electrical energy), it costs nature well over a million 
dollars to produce each gallon of petroleum. To say “I didn’t know that” 
doesn’t alter the inexorable energy accounting of eternally regenerative, 100- 
percent-efficient — ergo, 100-percent-concemed — physical-energy Universe. 
We find all the no-life-support-wealth-producing people going to their 
1980 jobs in their cars or buses, spending trillions of dollars’ worth of pe- 
troleum daily to get to their no-wealth-producing jobs. It doesn’t take a 
computer to tell you that it will save both Universe and humanity trillions 
of dollars a day to pay them handsomely to stay at home. "

how has it increased? 
If you mean by having bluetooth, I disagree. 
there is no difference on the threat model - using a usb cable or bluetooth. It considered that the host computer could be full of malware to begin with. All the data going through it will be checked on device, and become public on the blockchain. It is counter intuitive, but adding bluetooth and being clever on it's use could actually increase security.

Sure, better title would have been: BIP39 is not **the** standard, wallets are not inter-compatible.

encrypt your seedphrase. 
the problem is not the paper but a Single-address. In fact, that is not a wallet at all.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:13:47
no, the user does not need to memorize a code, but to keep two images. differently than a password based encryption, you don't need a computer to decrypt it. Arguably this is less cryptic to a non technical user. Memorizing a seed or password is a bad idea in general, even worse if you are going to use it rarely as it is the case for a cold storage.  
@_date: 2018-12-20 09:03:08
I am a fan of visual encryption and wrote a tool for that you can use from electrum.

try revealer.cc. 
You can export an encrypted backup of your seeds directly from your ledger. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:24:35
Every wallet becomes a paper wallet the moment it asks the user to write the seed words down. The problem is really "Single address, website generated". 
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:36:44
just leave the guy alone.. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:13:10
That is some very bad reasoning. 
At least you are consistent by calling it 'their money', it is in fact not yours when you leave it there. 
"Most of people who secure their bitcoin lost them over the years."- that is just bullshit: pretty sure that many more people lost 'their' money by leaving it on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:05:48
blockchain.info can (and most probably) will go down in fire any moment with your coins inside. If you properly backup your wallet seed, you can thrash your pc and not lose any money. have a look at the Electrum cold storage.

seed extentions, passphrase or whatever it is called can be quite confusing, as the warnings on the page you linked show. in my opinion visual encryption is less error prone for non technical users. 
I had the impression only aezeeds would actualy encrypt the seedphrase with the extension (?) maybe was a miss read of the bottom of this page:  
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:40:34
shameless plug: use a revealer. It is simple enough your inheritors will be able to decrypt it, and no need to trust your executor.

@_date: 2018-12-20 20:45:39
it is a different scheme, from Naor and Shamir. 
The user does not need to buy anything. The software ships with the Electrum Wallet and you can print out both shares. We decided to sell cards because it makes sense in some scenarios, for instance when using a hardware wallet, when you don't want to trust your printer or bother printing each share on a different printer.

Right, paper is physically vulnerable if not redundant, and redundancy creates a larger chance of compromise if not encrypted. Encrypted redundant  backups the way to go? I gave a shot to making this available in the revealer plugin for electrum. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 22:19:52
whats the point of having a single key instead of a wallet seed? it induces user mistake.. not to mention the insecurity of generating it on a webpage.

where is this 'really high' certainty coming from? on the other hand, there is brutal evidence of exchange failures. Gox was not the only centralized custodian to dissapear with users money. If you advocate to keep your btc on a exchange, you missed the whole point of bitcoin.
