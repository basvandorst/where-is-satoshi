Besides the redundancy of QR codes, Bitcoin addresses also have error detection: if you have mistakes in the address, there's only a 1 in 4 million chance that the new address is valid. In practice, either the address is right, or it's invalid.

If you want a successful tech startup, programming is important. Read the short post ["I Just Need a Programmer"]( by Wallingford. It's not enough to be an idea guy.

Tonal is a worthless, antiquated version of the hexadecimal system. It has no relevance to Bitcoin whatsoever. It doesn't belong on the bitcoin wiki, and should be deleted.
I linked to the talk page of Tonal Bitcoin, where that opinion has been completely censored, repeatedly, by Luke-Jr. All 6000 characters of it. The resulting (censored) talk page only has 500 characters.
EDIT: To clarify -- the opinion that "tonal bitcoin is worthless" has been censored, and the Tonal Bitcoin page continues to exist, despite having negative value to the general efforts of the Bitcoin wiki.

The network doesn't keep track of individual bitcoins (or individual satoshis), it keeps track of which "transaction outputs" have or have not been spent.
When a transaction is performed, it has some number of inputs and some number of outputs. The inputs are the coins you are spending, the outputs are what you are spending on. Except that the network only really keeps track of the transactions inputs and outputs, not the coins nor the addresses. An "unspent transaction output" is a transaction output that hasn't been used as an input. Once an output is used as an input, it cannot be used again.
So let's say you have an unspent transaction output of 0.1 BTC, and you want to send 0.04 BTC to some address. The bitcoin client creates a new transaction with your "0.1 BTC" as input, and with two outputs:
- 0.04 BTC to that address,
- 0.06 BTC to yourself.
So, the client generates "change" transaction outputs, in order to be able to split a transaction output into smaller units. Your old 0.1 BTC transaction output can't be used again. Your new 0.06 BTC transaction output can.
This was all to show you that the network doesn't really think in terms of individual bitcoins, but in terms of transaction inputs and transaction outputs.
How do you spend an unspent transaction output? You need to fulfill the "challenge" embedded in the unspent transaction output. For normal bitcoin transaction outputs, this means that you need to know the private key associated with the bitcoin address that the transaction was sent to.
So, if you lose the private key, you can't spend an unspent transaction output. So the bitcoins in that transaction output are "lost".

Why not just say "I have 10 mBTC" or "I have 10 m฿"? That's the standard way of denoting power of ten fractions of units (SI prefixes). It is easier to pronounce, too. "I have 10 mBTC" is pronounced "I have 10 millibitcoins". Whereas your proposal has a strange mismatch between notation and pronounciation.
