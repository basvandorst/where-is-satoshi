Im sorry this is a nub question but I am new.  How/what are bitcoin PAPER wallets?

Maybe,  maybe not. But if I ever won the lottery or when that one Nigerian prince finally pays me my millions I promise to give at least some of that money back to communities like this.

If i was a millionaire i would personalty try to give people in this thread at least some money back.  My heart goes out to each and every one of you who lost anything with Mt. Gox.

Ok thanks! And how do you feel about mining with mint coin because thats what my dad did.
