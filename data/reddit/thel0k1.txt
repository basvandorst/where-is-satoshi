I am getting my tortilla chips ready because I hope a delicious dip is around the corner. 
Too many limit-sells while I was asleep, now i'm biting my nails to get some back in..
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:59:05
Awesome thanks

Did I insult your mother or something? 
Just asking questions... 
I have limited knowledge about lightning tx's. I was just wondering if anyone waits until the memepool is low before doing important transactions or if bumping up TX fees might actually get the job done quicker. **I love this tech/crypto** and have been a long time supporter/HODLer but there is only so much time to research. Even with a development background there is still a lot to learn.

Gotcha. thnx

Remember you can set price alerts with the coinbase app (and I am sure others), so you can get notifications if it is time to run to GDAX...

Did you forget to add the unique identifier code to the memo? I ask, because, I did just that today. I missed that part of the instructions, until after I clicked "submit"..... smh fml
(gdax) Support has been contacted, but I am expecting a slow, profit losing transaction time to sort this out... I really hope I am not just SOL on the wire I just sent. At the very least, I hope it gets refunded so I can do it again properly.
If anyone is interested, I am happy to report the resolution process and time.

Thanks for the cordial response &amp; vid. I'll check it out.... a few times.

Wells fargo said they have the ability to change the memo of a domestic wire, but the case takes up to 3 business days. 
GDAX support has yet to respond, but i have provided them with all of the info I have (including the actual memo they received, amount, sender info, etc).
The funds are still in limbo 24+ hrs later as of yet.
Fingers are cramping from being crossed so hard.
My concern is in my exprience domestic wires done before bank closing times always clear same day. So, I don't understand why Wells fargo claims they are able to change elements of the wire up to 3 days after the fact. I will call them again tomorrow, as well as write support again.
Thanks for asking

Oh, Thanks! I could have sworn a similar thing happened with BTC too.
But the question remains, do you know of anyone who has benefited from this? Do you know the likelihood of having this happen again or if it's worth having (lottery-like) buy/sell orders in place? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:17
Yes Pls. 
(Even though my wallet is nowhere close to being able to afford their new (badass) roadster)
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:41:32
Holy Shit, It Worked!
edit: But I think you also broke GDAX in the process..... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:45:54
PLS! I have sold all of my positions pretty much, dying to buy more, but it is just constantly Bullish... I feel like we have a 5% dip coming, but only the BTC gods know....
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:00:39
If it is possible on coinbase/GDAX I am unaware of how you would do it. 
But it is for sure possible (and easier than you'd think) to do it on your local computer. Even if you use something like "Time Machine"  on an apple airport, you are getting back ups. But, I am paranoid so I have additional back ups on externals/thumb drives/etc.
While security on coinbase is good (remember to use two-factor auth security), sites have been hacked in the long long ago and BTC has been stolen. While a heist of that size is unlikely these days, it isn't out of the realm of possibilities....

I love watching him fight, I hope they do it for him.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:47:27
Don't worry BTCbrotha, just zoom out of your chart... This has happened to all of us.
It always keeps growing. After doing a ton of historical analysis, I am convinced it is going to take a monster to keep it from growing. (Monster = Full on Apocalypse)
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:54:26
Done and Done.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:17:34
My mistake. Honestly, the original idea was to donate toys to a local children's hospital. But, I doubted that anyone would believe me.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:03:15
Don't want to speak too soon, but I think your wife will be happy to see we are back in the black for the day.
Thanks for the dip buddy
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:43:03
Dude! 
$500 drop already... I put in my buys a little early, but Thanks OP!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:13:11
My guess is that there are a large number of early adopters, who haven't kept up/losing interest, and think that 10K is "The (actual) Moon" and cashing out at the 10K mark. 
But, in reality, many of us believe this is still just the beginning and 10k is just another milestone. 
My fear is that with this influx of new users and new buyers, we might have an overvalued currency if BTC is ~50K+ in like 4-6 months... That correction will scare the hell out of the newbies... (and be a wonderful dip for the veterans)
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:14:21
LOL, but hey it was just cancelled :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:53:08
While I do have some buys without fees, many if not MOST of my buys do have fees (BTC, ETH, LTC). That said, they are MUCH, MUCH smaller fees compared to coinbase. (like .33 compared to ~$5 at coinbase, for about the same buy in terms of a similar USD value buy)
Which is weird since they are sister companies. 
TL;DR - Gdax or localBitcoins. I am loving gdax right now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:36:37
Sound advice. Thanks buddy
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:42:26
Transfer your BTC to a wallet on your main computer. I like electrum. You have the ability to set your own fee on sends. I have put in super low fees and had reasonably quick confirmations... but for the majority of transactions, I prefer to use my own wallet... 
Bonus - if there is another fork, you are able to collect that new coin and turn it back in to BTC  (it's like a bonus for for bitcoin drama)
edit - also remember to follow the security instructions, and back up your wallet(s). But yeah, unless you are trading, I suggest keeping the vast majority of your coin OFF of your favorite exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:48:39
YES. You already knew that.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:15:02
Full disclosure, this is not regulated by the BBB or SEC. Just trying to make some smiles
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:46:53
Maybe try: 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:15:27
I must have misread the request
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:26:47
Good on ya.
But hey checkout gdax or some other exchange that allows for limit buys. That way you don't waste money on transaction/buying fees. (i almost exclusively bought on exchanges that charged fees on every buy until I realized there way around burning money for no reason)
If that sounds like greek to you, hop on youtube for an explanation on how to set up a limit buy, you will thank me when we reach the moon. 
Congrats on the growth buddy

sorry for late reply. Yes, it eventually showed back up. It just took a few days.
