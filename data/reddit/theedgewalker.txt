This is actually a pretty good motto.

Even including the largest estimates of derivatives, there doesn't appear to be more a single quadrillion.

This comment needs more attention.

Fast and Furious and Michael Brown not a big deal. The banks look like they're due for a slap on the wrist and he's like, "Peace out!"

Possibly, but perhaps an accidental firearm discharge.

I'd like to see negative interest currency come into wide circulation, used alongside our current positive interest currency. The hold mentality can certainly be an economic drag. I think that's what we're currently seeing with the large multinational banks buying treasuries instead of lending money.
Not an economist though...

Distributed power distribution leading to the dismantling of the old structures. perhaps.

If only I had tried to time the last roller coaster peak and valley! I'd have so much more to HODL, maybe.

First in, first out. It's simple. You bought 0.50 first so that much is eligible to sell at a long term gain before you get to the 0.15.
Unless you are or have an accountant, the other methods like specific identification are probably to complex to manage.
If a spreadsheet is too hard to use, get something like bitcoin.tax

If your tax strategy is "I don't expect the IRS to retroactively acquire Coinbase's full transaction history for every customer and will only report what I know the IRS knows about" that's some thin ice, if you ask me.

The date and gains calculations are pretty straightforward. The existing capital gains rules cover everything pretty airtight and IRS publication 551 is very cut and dry for US citizens. The like kind clarification was really only the last piece that was uncertain.

Tattooed it on? That's... really clever actually.

I looked at that horror of a forum for 2 minutes before I remembered how awful the web used to be. We didn't know anything better! Static content was all there was, and we liked it! Something about uphill both ways.

Ethereum is a publicly verifiable proof-of-work virtual machine. Computation occurring in the chain is a pretty big advance, imo.

I think your analogy is a little off. Yes, in some of those instances the original technology became obsolete - DVD's for instance.
In most of those situations though, the new technology just became another layer on top of the existing infrastructure. As far as I can tell, the NT kernel is fancy DOS, most devices only authenticate with IPV4 addressing by default, and the majority of power generated globally relies on steam turbines for the prime mover.
I think bitcoin is like wired ethernet. Will it yield to fiber? Yeah, eventually. But I suspect it will become entrenched as the backbone infrastructure for a long time.

Possibly correctly as well. I assume economic hitmen have been focused strongly on Moscow since the sanctions were put in place.
