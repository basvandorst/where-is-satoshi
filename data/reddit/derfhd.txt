Ha, I guess that's the best idea judging from the recent posts.

Why would I bring a knife when I could bring a parent and a phone?

When I first heard of BTC, I bought some through tf2wh exchange. I only bought $4 worth of it, and then I open up my bitcoin-qt roughly a year later where I found that 0.3 btc. I sold this for roughly $30, plus when I was mining I found another 0.1-2. And also keep in mind that the prices have inflated since I sold the BTC, the recieved BTC was cheaper before. I have never recieved $70 in BTC. At max £30 (or $45.) I don't want to sound like I'm hiding something, because I'm really not.

I don't know if you want me to pm you a picture of me or something, but if you are really that bothered by a so called 'Pretender' please do pm me.

I can see why you are skeptical about these types of things. I made this post not to get tips, but to just see if anyone on reddit knows how I should go around selling BTC. Some people responded badly, thinking I was a scammer, and some people actually helped. I want to say thank you for not judging me as some other people did. Also, thank you so much for the tip, I will definitely safe keep your tip for as long as possible as course from your advice.
Thank you,
DerfHD/Fred :)
