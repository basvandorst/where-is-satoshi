@_date: 2014-07-23 04:14:58
I totally agree with xb102, AS a Customer, regulation is always good, so that it provides customer protection against fraud.we will have confidence when there is regulation in place and we can invest more but Now If have any issue or concern with companies like coinbase, xapo, karkaen, we have depend on the email, sometimes they ignore and you are at there mercy. I do not  understand
why these companies does not customer service phone # or call center  to address the concerns or issues of customer, when they funded with millions from VC's to setup the business         
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:10:45
