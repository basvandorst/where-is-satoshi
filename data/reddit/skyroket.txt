It works in the stock market because "everyone uses it" so when you see signs for a bull market (rising), people buy "because it's about to go up" and it goes up.  Vice versa for signs of a bear market.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
It doesn't work in crypto because

This sub isn't all about the coin, but some cryptocurrency information.  Also, everything else is based on Bitcoin.  Also, I don't care about INVESTING in Bitcoin, but I do care about the technology, and want to keep up on it.

There are a lot of reasons to sell a digital asset:
* You need money.
* You see another opportunity that could be better, like a coin that is down for no reason.
* You are over-extended and want to reduce your overall holdings.
Coming in here to "gloat" or try to scare people out of selling is just revealing yourself to be the asshat you really are.  Fuck off and leave people to their own investment methods.

So we can schedule emails to go when the deadman switch happens?  I assumed only my failsafe person would get an email that gives them access to my account.

Sell for 5% profit instead of 100% profit.  There are more 5% spikes in the time it takes to do one 100% spike.  Ideally, there'd be more than 20 little spikes, so you'd have more money than if you bought and held.

Great question.  I get a 1099 from my regular retirement and investment accounts.
It'd be extremely difficult for me to track my gains at this point, because some of my holdings I bought with USD, and some I bought with BTC.  I'd have to go figure out what the value of BTC in USD was at the time of purchase in order to figure out my cost basis, then figure profits.

Are you dissatisfied with your Coinbase experience, or are you just now learning that you have problems you didn't realize you had?  This is a bullshit post.

I took it as he was a Coinbase user like myself, that didn't realize we had a fee problem until we read this post, telling us we had a problem.  That usually means it's not a problem, so I asked if he had had any problems.  But yes, please downvote my comment if you feel like it's out of place.  I don't want to misunderstand anyone.

Do you think Bitconnect shares any similarities with a ponzi scheme?  Better than average returns.  The system encourages you to lock up your "money" for an extended period of time so they can use it to pay returns to new members?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:06:40


I read that as buys and sells are counted separately, as different transaction types.  They're only interested in the people who have bought more than 20k, OR sold more than 20k, OR transferred more than 20k, OR received more than 20k.

It's not a flat fee like typical stock market exchanges ($7/trade, etc).  It's usually like 0.25% which isn't shit.  Yes, it adds up over time, but in the grand scheme of things, when you are shooting for 5% and make 4.75% instead, it's not a big deal.

Just because 2FA is moot on one device, doesn't mean it stopped protecting other devices and entry points.  Yes, a hacker can log on if he has your phone unlocked.  But he can't log on from his Russian VPN PC, because he doesn't have access to your phone.

Selling at the bottom is "artificially" moving the market lower than where it would have recovered naturally.  This has the potential to increase the fear and panic selling that had already occurred, and has started to subside.

I asked myself the same question, but if you click the submitted link, you can see people complaining about their "Network Fee" which "is not a miner fee" however, they don't have the same "network fee" for Bitcoin Cash transactions.  They're preying on people's ignorance of what kind of fees are actually associated with sending cryptocurrency.

It's definitely been a new perspective in the last couple weeks.  I've been on an exchange that doesn't trade with USD.  Their "base" currency is BTC.  Everything else fluctuates against BTC, and you don't even notice BTC vs USD.  It's a glimpse into the future?

Yeah, and you don't go all-in.  When you buy right now, it's going to dip again tomorrow.  Buy a little more.  Your cost basis, your average price per "share" keeps going down when you buy more lower, so **when it does reverse, and go back up** you won't have far to go before you're in profit territory.

Bittrex uses BTC as a base currency.  Every other coin is sold in BTC.  It's actually really quite annoying for me, coming from USD trading.  Everything is priced 0.0000473 or 0.0029700.  You gotta double check every order to make sure it's got the right amount of zeroes in front of it.
Pinpointing the coin that's not falling as fast as everything else is kinda tough, though.

When you want to shoot your gun, you need to have some gunpowder dry (not the case with more modern ammunition - this is probably an old saying).  If your gunpowder is wet, you're not ready to shoot.  If you have dry gunpowder, you're ready to pull the trigger, so to speak.  Are you ready to "pull the trigger" on a BTC dip?

Where are you trading that the exchange commission is not a percentage?
I did a little trading on the stock market, and the fees were $7 or $8 per trade.  THEN you have to be trading $700+ at a time for the fee to be minimal 1%.  I wanted to trade smaller, so I got frustrated easily.
All the fees I've seen for crypto exchanges are % based (0.25% or something small like that).

No offense, but this is probably the only place on their site where they call BCash "Bitcoin".  Everywhere else, it's called Bitcoin Cash.  They refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core.
Is that enough?  Do we still need to be trying to report them to Google so the site gets flagged in Chrome, and search results?  I wouldn't want to lose money by sending Bitcoin to my mother's BCash address, because she doesn't know the difference.
They're definitely treading a fine line.

Wow that would actually be the ONLY thing we need to boost Bitcoin adoption and legitimize it.  I would say the race would be finished if Amazon adopts.  Everyone after that is just late to the party.
People are already using Bitcoin on Amazon through an illegal money laundering (they don't market themselves as that) service.  You make a public wish list.  Post it to this site, and some drug lord buys it for you and ships it to you.  You pay THEM in Bitcoin, and they buy your list using USD or whatever.
No way I'm posting the site address.  I tried to buy an $11 deal.  3 people attempted it and failed (how do you fail to buy something off Amazon?) so I just got my $12 out (cost me $4 in network transfer fees).  Great idea, but not executed very well, and a haven for money laundering.
