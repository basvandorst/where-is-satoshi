If you look at the animal kingdom, rape,murder and theft between species are common, but we learn ofcourse from a very early age that violance is "wrong".
But i would say those things are also relative.  You are not really born into some game with pre decided rules. we the people create the rules!
You and most people ofcourse dont agree with that, but that does not mean im wrong.

Maybe stupid question but what decideds how much data is being sent? 
a bigger transactions does not have to mean bigger amount of data?

in a free market we would end up with a monopol or duopol and good education would be expensiv for a normal family. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:24:50
It's not immoral or unnecessary if you belive that it is for a good cause and will help people in the future. 
I understand what you say but i think you also need to understand how "we" the other people think. But you are wrong(correct from your view but wrong from mine) saying it immoral or unnecessary, it all comes down to your opinion&amp;ideology 
Would you consider it wrong to break into a home if you could save a baby in there? 
Would you steal the nearest car to save your family from[insert random terrible thing]

In the long run it does not matter how well they serve people, it will always end with monopoly or duopoly in each sector and they will only try maximizing profit. this is free market 101. 
It will end up with expensiv education that only the rich can afford, and then decent education for the medium class and no education for the poor. 
i prefer the system in my country that education everyone.

This is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:38:06
yes it does, there isnt a universial right here.
If i would take money from you and i believed i could save alot of lifes i would consider it wrong NOT to do it. 
You on the other hand might consider it wrong and thereby letting other people die(which i consider wrong)
neither one of us is right or wrong here.
@_date: 2013-05-25 13:09:33
none of the things you brought up are free markets and im not even talking about about those sectors, im mosly talking about healthcare and education. 
(i dont know what country you are from but im sure your country has alot of diffrent market regulations)

mess? it isn't a mess and if you think bigger and compare young people today with same people 100-200 years ago we are fucking awsome. compare Europe to countries that has no state(chaos) like Africa. Then look at math and reading ability. 
the modern school system has done really great things the last decade.

I don't agree. I thinks it's fair enough that the vendors actully accept bitcoin as payment, that is an enough risk for them.
Now, the consumers like this subreddit should do their part and actully use their bitcoins to consume instead of speculating. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 15:29:31
new kind of money? -.-
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:45:09
Damn, seems like alot of butthurt Americans here that need to look at other countries. 
taxes can do amazing things.

i quote from londons_explorer 
"This makes sense.
Argentina is struggling with very high inflation. If you were in argentina, the value of your money in your bank would be going down all the time. The sensible thing for you to do would be to convert all of it to dollars, wait for the economy to recover, and then convert it all back again.
But the mere act of doing so kills the economy more.
To stop that, the government has put in rules restricting currency conversions.
These rules prevent Google converting dollars to peso's, which effectively means they havent got any cash to pay developers with. Not much they can do about it. Payments in the other direction will be converted by credit card companies, but they too may soon disallow payments for things outside Argentina."

Well if you only look at the bad things of course you only gona find those things. 
Meanwhile im enjoying great healthcare, great education that everyone from the poorest can easily go to university. 
You are missing out. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:54:40
But this isnt really a micro transaction, its 10 dollars. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:51:18
So the problem here isn't taxes but that your country is spending it on the wrong things? 
Why not try to change that first? 
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:19:28
Not enough faith in the justice system. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:16:35
Do you even know what a "right" is? 
Yes, i understand the theft argument, but you can't ignore our side. We belive we have the right to force you to pay taxes because it is for a good cause.(you cant you ignore that, otherwise you will never understand)
all it comes down to is difference in opinion noone here is right or wrong. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:01:38
great healthcare and great education that is available to everyone great infrastructure etc. 
how? we pay a lot of taxes and my country is using it on other things then war. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:56:42
The motives behind why a state has originally been created does not mean that a state(taxes society) has  no advantages in the modern world. 
The state in my country has done really amazing things the past 100 years. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:48:15
You need to look at the real world, in my country the state is actully working and doing really fucking great work.

No, the buyers should accept a higher price for bitcoins. The vendors are right now taking a HUGE risk in accepting bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 10:49:30
Education,healtcare and crimes(prisons etc), these are things that a state would do better for the people then a free market would. 
(in the long run) 
@_date: 2013-05-25 13:02:23
Yes, but that doest mean i personally support it. 
The point it that u can't tell people that your way is the only correct one. 
ideology, ethics and moral problems like these are personal stuff, one is not more right then the other. 
i understand people that consider taxes theft, but you also need to understand how the "other side" is thinking.
