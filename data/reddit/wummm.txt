With a low enough fee they can do that for months or years and never get it. Worth the trouble?
They should accept payments over LN, which is safe and instant. Even without a backlog, btc payments are not safe until they are mined.

They won't disappear at all. LN is not replacing or reducing onchain tx, as the tx that will happen on LN are not happening on the chain today for the most part.

Petty fights? Segwit2x was a very serious threat, they tried everything to pass off as Core clients, to try to sybil attack normal users, and much more. The last release of Core before the failed fork date was packed with necessary protections against that.
Instead of shitting on the Core devs for doing important thing, rather complain to the Bcash and Segwit2x people for holding up progress for more than a year.
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:42:17
I did. Which coin do you have in mind that is more secure and censorship resistant than Bitcoin today?
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:56:39
Litecoin is close to the same, but has less hash power. So do all of the other coins you mentioned.
I am a big fan of Monero, but it is more cutting edge, e.g. it had a critical bug with inflation in recent times, fortunately caught and fixed with responsible disclosure. They roll out features very quickly, which is great, but also a security risk.
ZCash is much worse in that regard - people could be inflating it now and you wouldn't know it. The zksnark lib they based their work on was prototype quality at best.
Don't need to go into detail with Ethereum after losses of funds through Parity twice, people having issues syncing up, and much more.
I did my research, and I am not a maximalist. Just stating a trivial fact that nothing comes close to Bitcoin at the moment w.r.t. security and censorship resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:51:52
All of them are worse in the most important point, security and censorship resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:50:37
Good thing you are not stealing anything off of a ledger, as in that case, the tx never arrives in the ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:27:50
I wonder how many people use the Bitcoin Core wallet. I use a Core node to power my Electrum. Everyone I know use hardware wallets or other light clients.
So I am honestly not quite sure how important features in this wallet really are.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:08:13
Payment channels existed before LN and you got the perfect use case for them. Any reason exchanges haven't been using them between each other if indeed that much traffic is between them? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:52:13
Kraken already supports segwit, just not bech32. So they're likely not using core for the wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:46:39
If there had been 90%+ consensus for 2x, it would have happened. Don't be naive. I don't need to remind you that they had a grand total of one developer and zero reviews resulting in an epic failure at the fork block.
Forks can happen, and Core doesn't care, unless it's like 2x and they try to pull off the same PoW and no replay protection and impersonating Core nodes to trick users.
Core didn't give a damn about Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold, apart from the cash folks stalling segwit for a year.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:25:47
RPC support has been there for a long time. It's not in the UI because the Core team has been distracted fighting stupid fork attempts by CEOs (such as Brian).

Side effect of having no demand. Today's Bitcoin works the same way as the original Bitcoin - mining fees and all.
@_date: 2018-01-10 07:15:37
It stops being a disagreements if new users want to get into Bitcoin, but accidentally get into Bitcoin Cash because the 1% managed to trick them.
If it was some other alt that tried to do this, you'd most likely agree, but somehow you have a blind spot here.

They can not do pretty much anything they want. For example, they can't spend the coins you own
I agree mining decentralization is not great in Bitcoin, but it's still better than in any altcoin. Some might have more distribution of hash power, but way way way less hash power overall, making it easy to attack.

How much censorship resistance do you need for buying coffee?

I'd also like cheap onchain payments, but only if they don't reduce the core properties of Bitcoin: censorship resistance.

Funny how everyone screams for state intervention when it suits them, but the rest of the time, we want a free market.

@_date: 2017-12-30 14:46:15
Bitcoin is about censorship resistant secure money. If everyone can use it to buy coffee too, that would be great, but it is definitely a smaller priority to preserving the unique property that Bitcoin has.
It is easier to build a cheap payment mechanism on top of a censorship resistant ledger than the other way round, which is close to impossible.

When you create it on in a live boot on an online computer, you can be compromised.
If you destroy the USB after, how will you access your funds?
The safe way without a HW wallet is two have an airgapped computer that has never been online, create the wallet there, and only sign transactions on that. Need to move the unsigned and signed tx between an online computer and that offline computer twice. HW wallets exist to remove that hassle.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:39:32
Confirms you are not dealing with that money. It's not about proving things, you are just talking out of your ass assuming things if you are not.
For example, if you wanna buy a house, you first need the cash in your bank account. If you are rich, a couple of million per bank account is normal.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:05
No worries.
No, that's the point of a HW wallet. The secrets are inside the hardware and never leave it. On your machine, you have software that shows your balance and let's you create a transaction, but it is sent to the HW wallet to be signed. The machine never has access to the secrets, so even if it is hacked, you are safe.

True, but that safe increase is non-zero for sure, and as I said, kicking the can down the road until LN is ready would have been nice.
I also want segwit, regardless of whether it increases capacity or not, for the other benefits.

If ETC is around, there is demand, so it's fair.

It's almost as if it takes time to build up the same infrastructure and trust in an altcoin. If Bitcoin gets stuck here for another few years and litecoin progresses, you can expect people to move there.
You also cherry picked Litecoin, ignoring that there are other alts that enjoy some success, which could be a direct influence of Bitcoin's problems.
@_date: 2017-02-27 07:04:59


That they have bugs does not detract from their opinion. They are still a powerhouse of the BTC economy, having a shitload of users of their wallet and crazy numbers of visits to their explorer. If we wanna weigh opinions, blockchain.info's opinion should be pretty high up there. The dev's only job should be to decide if the user's wishes can be technically done without compromising the security and censorship resistance and other core properties of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:42:32
He is right though, if Bitcoin fails at preserving censorship-resistance, another coin will succeed.
If you want to arrive in the future more quickly, you better try fast and fail fast.
It is a valid stance, just as being conservative is valid.

Do you not think that for every 10 persons that could do it, 9 are not gonna bother?

@_date: 2017-02-28 09:30:43
I am following it, and I still don't believe that a HF would be hard to pull off safely with enough time (95% signaling plus months of grace period). Any altcoin that exists as a result is fair-game, because if there is one, there is demand, so the split is fair. If the upgraded Bitcoin keeps 95%+ of its users, that should be no major issue. See ETH vs. ETC for comparison. ETH is stronger than it was before the fork.
I am dev too, so I am not talking out of my ass.
Also note that the anti-limit-increase arguments have shifted over the years. In the beginning, bigger blocks were a threat to decentralization, but hardforks were deemed doable. Now that segwit itself implements this increase, the argument shifted to be against HF. That is strange.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:36:17
Most of the 100+ Bitcoin Core devs did not propose or implement changes the network or consensus rules. I think famwhat28's point was that the ones that do so are very close to Blockstream or employed by them.

It is generally unlikely he was hit by a bus or died from an accident. He might have suffered from a disease and then retreated from Bitcoin as a consequence, but we can't know.
Weighing all data that we have, it is likely Satoshi is still around and still has the keys (he was the first one to tell people to never delete a wallet).
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:11:18
The problem arises much earlier. Setting up and running a node is just hugely inconvenient for a normal user, irrelevant of the resource requirements.

There is no spam, just amounts of fees paid that are sufficient or insufficient to make it into a block.
There is no good objective way to define spam. Any attempt is a slippery slope leading to a morality police. The only reasonable option is to treat all transactions as equal: if they pay, they stay.

Because it is a massive research and engineering project. A lot of progress has been made under the assumption of SegWit. Throwing that out delays LN by months/years.
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:16:15
Why was SegWit always touted as a prerequisite? Something with malleability etc. blockchain.info even published their implementation but said it was insecure as long as the malleability thing was not fixed.

If the assertion that Satoshi's limit was arbitrary is true (which it arguably was, 1mb was installed when the average blocksize was orders of magnitudes lower), that does not mean much. What if we had installed 500kb as a limit? Then today's 1mb would be a doubling, and we can easily sustain it. But people would be fighting the same as now and claiming that doubling is a huge increase and a huge risk, etc.


That is what I am saying. If Satoshi had put 2mb or 4mb, we would have put a limit to transaction sizes in place to avoid the quadratic hashing issue (or solved it differently, sth like segwit) and enjoy higher transaction throughput.
@_date: 2017-02-08 23:42:55

Last time I looked into it many months ago, the protocol was extremely badly designed, and the code was a obviously written by amateur coders.

There might be an altcoin after the fork, but if there is, there is demand for it and it deserves to be there. If 95% of the economy sticks with the coin after the upgrade, we're safe.

It'd rather have larger throughput, and as a result more adoption and better chances of bitcoin succeeding longer-term, than trying to accommodate people with bad internet.

A stable coin with no users isn't success.
Can it be called a success if its userbase stops growing or even starts shrinking at this early stage, while ltc or xmr or something new pushes ahead like bitcoin was supposed to? 
Is it a success if it becomes digital gold, even though it inarguably set out to be p2p cash?

If that really became a problem, they could pay more fees to solve the problem.
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:23:27
Constant backlog is what Maxwell etc. say is critical for a fee market and long term sustainability of miners. I wasn't talking about today, specifically.
In any case, mempool will always fall back, with legitimate or "spam" tx. If it is too full as to make it too expensive for you, or you expect your tx to not be confirmed in a reasonable amount of time, you simply won't do the transactions. Only transactions that are expected to confirm within a usable time by are present in the backlog, and by definition, those get cleared away. It corrects itself in that way, but that is at the cost of increased usage/adoption.
Not to mention that there is no spam. If it pays, it is legitimate. No one can objectively define what spam is, lest you wanna go down a slippery slope and have a morality police.
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:41:02

I sure hope so, though I am afraid we might be too late with segwit kicking the can down the road. Blocks have been full for a long time already, and we should have deployed segwit or a limit increase ideally before that, or shortly after that. Every day without it we miss out on adoption and lose users to the competition.
Of course better late than never.

In a soft fork, the same thing is true. It can get the hashing majority but still have significant opposition. That part could just split off.

What we need right now is more adoption, and not put deterrents in the way of new users. The fee market is needed eventually, but for many years to come, the block subsidy is plenty enough for miners.

I am sure you can do the math, and the numbers will seem exceedingly big, but that is the point I made: in 20 years, we might sneeze at those numbers, like we sneeze at 32mb RAM from 1995 today.
And of course, we do not need to jump from here to this future in one day. We just should not stop here and pretend everything is great, working as intended, Bitcoin is digital gold and not p2p cash, etc.

Less things that can break. Less things to maintain. Less time to run tests (they are run constantly). 
Imagine that for every change in the other three calls replacing getinfo, the dev would need to update the getinfo call too, as well as the tests covering it, and the docs and release notes. And the code reviewers have to double check. Already a couple of hours lost.
If it is only one thing, it's manageable, but if you never deprecated anything because there's always a user that's too lazy to switch to the new way, you'll soon be spending a disproportionate time maintaining the cruft.

The answer to the question is obvious: because the value lies in the current network and its infrastructure, and starting without access to that from the start is an uphill battle. It might still be done if they fail this way, but it makes sense to try this way first.

hardfork logistics is overplayed. Activate after a year and 95% hashrate and a grace period of a couple of months is plenty good enough.
No one wants to lose out being stuck on the old chain after that, you can be sure that everyone who matters and has their investment to protect will upgrade in time.

It is not even a problem. There are plenty of Satoshis (smallest Bitcoin unit) to go around, even if many Bitcoins are lost.
If we would really run into a liquidity problem as a consequence (I didn't do the math, but I assume it's pretty much impossible), we could always make them more divisible.
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:23:16
All other cryptocoins, and even offchain centralized systems like Coinbase, or even worse, Paypal.
First of all, the load can be divided among different chains, so users can basically scale transactions by distributing them on different coins. Secondly, even if they going to run into the scaling issues, they wouldn't for a long time. I have no reason to assume that Bitcoin could not easily handle 2mb, or even 4mb, and the competition will go to the limits if Bitcoin isn't (that is what competition is about: it fosters progress). Litecoin has the equivalent of 4mb blocks in shorter block times already, for example, and people will make use of that if Bitcoin gets stuck here for some more years.

prefect is the enemy of good, and there is nothing wrong in incremental improvements to bridge the time until better tech is developed.
1mb blocks we're not full all the time just because the space was there. space usage grew with adoption. 
 A factor of 2 or 4 can make a huge difference. Imagine Satoshi had put the arbitrary limit at 100kb instead. Wouldn't you have been glad to raise that to 1mb to sustain the adoption we had in the last 3 years? We're in the same situation now, just that we probably missed out on a good deal of adoption already.

Get over yourself. Everyone starts at the beginning. You also did.
@_date: 2017-02-03 09:37:42
I'm aware of all of that, and still, 1mb is not a very large increase.
If satoshi had put the limit at 2 instead of 1 (which was arbitrary), I'm sure no one would be going around saying how it's too much. Same for 4. All real issues arising from those sizes would be fixed or worked around without decreasing the size to 1mb.

@_date: 2017-02-28 06:14:31
Agreed. But to be honest, we could have alleviated the problem a lot sooner with a safe HF if everyone worked towards in years ago when it was first proposed. No matter how much people fear forks, I am convinced that enough signalling time and grace period make it perfectly safe. Unfortunately, there was so much opposition and stalling before SegWit was finally dropped at the HK convention. I am still unsure why a simple increase had so much opposition, even before SegWit was invented and known to be a safer/nicer solution.

Keeping around cruft is pointless, seeing that everyone will get used to the change in no time. With every deprecation there are unhappy people, but most of the time it's simple laziness.
Most will likely just need to call one of the other three calls to cover their previous usage. I.e. if your typical usage was to ping bitcoind for readiness or sync status, use the one that'll show you that instead.

I agree the censo rship is fucking shit. I disagree that SegWit has a lot to do with that topic. It stands on its own, its list of benefits is immense, and its testing and review and ecosystem support is spectacular.

With a hard coded client that the majority enforces through signaling and grace period I know what I am gonna get: i.e. 2mb or 4mb, but not 50mb. I would want to upgrade to 2mb or 4mb, but not more. With BU, I have no control over that.
Then, the miners should serve the users. If they get together and decide that 8mb is fine against the wish of the majority of users, it would be a big problem, resp. a problem that is hard and messy to fix. 
If miners can control the blocksize, smaller miners can easily be prevented from joining the network. We already have too big miners/pools, we don't want more of that. What Bitcoin provides me is censorship resistance, but that could quickly die if small miners die and big miners consolidate more and more.


I didn't know the answer, but if BU does not has this, then yes of course I prefer the upgrade where the majority of users move to a bigger limit in a coordinated fashion.
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:03:49

@_date: 2017-03-25 20:10:13
How do you coordinate the UASF? How can you know that at the date of activation that everyone will enforce it? Doesn't it practically need overwhelming consensus, or you get a split just like in a HF?

How exactly is it coordinated? Sounds like I can only safely run it if I know everyone else will too, but how can I know in advance?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:49:48


I would hope so, but as I said before, 75% miner hashrate does not imply 75% of the users agree with them or will accept their blocks. Even today's hashrate percentage of BU is most likely much less than the percentage of the economy actually running BU.

I don't know why that would be a problem. If you need non-malleable transactions, use segwit transactions. If you need malleable transactions, you can still have them.
Even if there is a downside to it, the safer deployment method is worth it. And we need to stop bike shedding and get on with it.
51% attack: can you elaborate or link me to an explanation under what circumstances exactly this would be possible? I assume if an old node receives funds from a segwit output, but I am not sure.
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:17:20
Goalshifting. At first, it was increasing the blocksize. Then it was a new consensus scheme with no limit. SegWit was never mutually exclusive to those efforts, until it suddenly became a target of a lot of FUD.
Why don't you accept SegWit *and* push for higher limits? SegWit has so many benefits and testing it is ridiculous to not use it.
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:28:49
By a constant factor, so it's irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:59:42
There is no such thing as hashrate voting. It is hashrate signalling, so a smooth upgrade can be coordinated. Don't forget, the miners work for the users and get paid to order transactions, that's it. They are not the ones deciding the rules.
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:34:10
Demand could fall off for good though if a competitor overtakes Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:27:34
That doesn't help you: every input increases the size of the transaction, and as you know, you pay per kb, not per transaction.
@_date: 2017-03-16 13:48:26
No, you can fire up a million nodes, if no one else is running nodes with the same rules, it's worthless. You need demand for your coin and an ecosystem, which you can't create by firing up nodes.
Even if only 20% of the miners follow and run with segwit (which is unlikely, as many more would follow if they don't want to stop earning money), that is enough to support the network. After all, the hashrate was 20% of what it is now only months ago, and the network hasn't significantly changed.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:37:19

How to coordinate? If half the network activates by flagday and half doesn't, the miner's against it have not a big enough incentive to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:38:53
I see the point, but it's hard to estimate. The same could have been said for $1 fee two years ago, and indeed it seems people are using other cryptos as a result. But the demand for Bitcoin is still there.
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:39:40


I still have to process and validate everyone's 10mb or 100mb blocks ("go with the flow", as you say), otherwise I can lose money easily.
What if I don't want that or actually cannot do that?
More importantly, as I said before, what if a small miner cannot do that? They will have to shut down or join a bigger pool. As you agree, this is a bad thing.


If all miners, but half of the nodes accepts them at and half doesn't, what happens? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:49:35
The simpler answer is that demand has been rising with a predictable rate for many years, and now we are here.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:27:04
Can be done as a SF too.
Even if not, the point stands: you can do soft forks that affect unupgraded nodes. What about stopping mining reward right now instead of the following the regular old halving schedule? This is obviously possible with a SF, but affects unupgraded nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:38:32


Not saying it's not true, but could you name some concrete examples? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:38:13
Some use cases were priced out with the recent fee increase already . If the fee was $50, your and my normal transactions would be priced out, but my use case for digital gold won't. I'm sure then people will say that 50 dollars is completely reasonable to secure thousands /millions of dollars in a digital asset that cannot be censored or confiscated. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:01:10
What do you mean? Payment channels to other nodes are created, you and other people can route transaction data through the resulting network. Not every node sees every transaction, just the nodes along the "best path" from sender to recipient. Onion routing is applied so that intermediate nodes don't know where the transaction is coming from or going to.

I call BS on this theory. You can rarely match news to price movements with any accuracy, and there are ton of things other than BU that could be responsible, as simple as correcting from a quick bullrun, to uncertainty regarding the ETF (GABI said they are liquidating because of it), and much more. Markets do what markets do.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:14:23


Consider this thought experiment: you create your own altcoin, remove the 21M coin limit and make yourself the central issuer. You are the only user of your coin, but you manage to build/buy enough miners to put in more proof of work into your chain than the total work put into the Bitcoin chain. No one else uses your coin. Is your coin now Bitcoin? You can even use the same genesis block made by Satoshi. I hope this example makes it clear that your coin is not Bitcoin, because everybody else is using the Bitcoin they have always been running, even if is backed my less mining power than your own coin.
The chain with the most work is the valid chain.
That just means that the chain with the most work complying with the consensus rules is the valid chain in case there are multiple valid forks, such as two competing valid blocks (or chains of blocks) produced by different miners. Nothing more, nothing less. In that case, a "reorg" happens. This occurs regularly.
Of course, if the majority of the users get together and declare a coin with different rules "Bitcoin", so be it, but that has little to do with hashrate and everything to do with network effect.

That is not clear. If 95% of the nodes want it, they can get it, and the miners that don't follow will go out of business or stay on an small chain with worthless (or close to worthless) coins.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:16:54
Call it whatever you want, I am just stating the obvious, namely that node count decreases have much more to do with it being a general hassle than the blocksize being at 1mb or 300kb or 2mb.
Also, don't pretend like everything is black and white. If I need my freedom and privacy, I can easily fall back on my node, but I can choose to "give up my freedom" (exaggeration much) when I buy my coffee in my first world country.

I and everyone I know don't run nodes because it's a hassle in general. Start wallet, wait more than a couple of minutes to sync before you can spend? 300kb blocks or 1mb blocks don't change that, syncing will always be non-instant.
Node count droppage is obviously much more correlated to the emergence of usable thin clients like MyCelium, Electrum etc.

A node in Bitcoin will either relay your tx or it won't, there is no tampering with it. Same for LN. If a node doesn't work, you can use a different path. The internet works the same way, it routes around slow/broken nodes.

People should stop trying to relate price movements to events. You can find correlations in anything, and also "prove" the opposite.
Markets do what markets do. The recent "crash" could have happened for a number of different reasons.
Also, a 20% loss in market cap is better than a 95% loss in case the UASF fails because there wasn't enough lead time.

You might be forced to use it because your recipient won't take anything else (edit: tbh, I am not sure if this can technically happen, I just realized).

This description applies much better to the BU miners.
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:07:37
So if you just run a node, but don't personally use that node for anything (i.e. it is just running without any interaction from you), it doesn't help you nor Bitcoin Core nor anybody. If you think otherwise, I'd like to know how you think it helps, and who it helps.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:11:40
For example?
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:32:56
It is valid. Everyone decides for themselves what they use. Miners work for the users, and if the majority of them switch to something that the majority of users does not care about, they will be mining a coin that is worth much less. 75% miner hashrate does not imply 75% of the users agree with them or will accept their blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:43:27
The chain with the most work is the valid chain. 
That just means that the chain with the most work **complying with the consensus rules** is the valid chain in case there are multiple valid forks, such as two competing valid blocks /or chains of blocks) produced by different miners. Nothing more, nothing less. In that case, a "reorg" happens. This occurs regularly.
Consider this thought experiment: you create your own altcoin, remove the 21M coin limit and make yourself the central issuer. You are the only user of your coin, but you manage to build/buy enough miners to put in more proof of work into your chain than the total work put into the Bitcoin chain. No one else uses your coin. Is your coin now Bitcoin? You can even use the same genesis block made by Satoshi. I hope this example makes it clear that your coin is not Bitcoin, because everybody else is using the Bitcoin they have always been running, even if is backed my less mining power than your own coin.
Of course, if the majority of the users get together and declare a coin with different rules "Bitcoin", so be it, but that has little to do with hashrate and everything to do with network effect.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:44:05
Mempool can't be consistently growing. People don't do their transactions under those circumstances, which automatically clears the backlog.

That is an interesting point, thanks. I guess that even if only 20% of the miners do not censor segwit transactions, it's a good enough to start building Schnorr, MAST and deploy LN. That is what censorship resistance is about: if you have enough independent miners, one of them will cover you.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:53:20
You could soft fork in unlimited inflation. That would affect everyone, even unupgraded nodes, as it would affect the coin valuation.

It would have tanked, but would have recovered (ETH is now stronger than ever before, even with ETC around).
But regardless of that, I would not advocate for a contentious hardfork. I don't count it as contentious if less than 5% want to be left behind.
I accept that speculation is uninteresting to you. It isn't to me, since I don't see it as speculation, but trivial facts. I am just someone who would like to move a bit faster and not as conservatively as we are now in order to ensure Bitcoin keeps growing and defending it's number one spot.
This is all talk of the past, btw. I agree that segwit is superior to a HF increase and hope it gets activated.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:24:06
Just saying that your node is not protecting anything if you don't use the node to power your wallet. In my humble opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:21:07


This doesn't help. Before china started stalling on SegWit, Core was stalling forever on a limit increase that was supported by practically everyone (all relevant Bitcoin companies, all miners, ...).
I agree though that we should move forward now.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:06:48
technically you can keep control over your private keys and outsource the full node business to another company. Of course it's better to run your own, but again, it's less hassle to outsource, so I guess that is gonna happen more. 
Also today, barely any merchant runs their own node. Most even outsource private key handling to coinbase and bitpay and the like. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:16:58
I agree, I like it much better now. 
Not sure what you are implying, that it wasn't happening? There is a ton of evidence that it was, and I was personally affected lots of times. All the proof I ever posted was removed immediately. I'll PM you proof if you are genuinely interested, but I doubt you really are.

I think the emergence of various light wallets is a much stronger candidate to explain the heavy decline in nodes. I ran a full node in 2011 because I had to. Not anymore, not since I use electrum, mycelium and mytrezor.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:41:46
I think the idea is that they either comply, or mine coins that are next to worthless. Either is okay and doesn't significantly affect the rest of the economy in moving forward.

In the worst case, you lock in 5-10% profits, which is nothing to sneeze at. With very good chances, you can 1.5x or 2x this by shorting an extreme pump.
Compared to normal daytrading where you are likely to lose money, this isn't bad.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:57:41
Maybe, but maybe the market doesn't give a fuck about segwit or BU. For example, we reached a new ATH during the most heated time of the debate.

I concede it wasn't a nice thing to do of Todd. I guess no one has a problem with it because rbtc has no problems repeating lies and harassing people, so "they had it coming". You and I both know what the BU people would've done if the same error had been made by core. 
It's hard being nice to those that are vicious to you.

The point of LN is move the transactions off the chain, not double them, so your math does not work out. A lot of today's backlog wouldn't even touch the chain if LN was successful and widely used.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:31:55
It's clear that miners need to upgrade for softforks to work. Always was the case.
Colluding miners can only steal from nodes that didn't upgrade, and at significant risk. The attack would need to net them more than mining honestly, which is really really hard/next to impossible. The number of targets decreases quickly over time as nodes upgrade, and the juicy targets will be the first ones to upgrade anyway. 
UASF might be more dangerous, but it might be an effective way of getting the miners to fall in line if they don't represent the community. HF/SF only works when the miners represent the community well, which doesn't seem to be the case right now.

Hashrate exists to resolve conflicts between multiple valid chains, nothing more.
If I make my private coin that has different rules but more hashrate than all of bitcoin's put together, it won't automatically become bitcoin. The rest of the economy will reject my blocks as invalid.

Yes, so if BU wants to merge mine (merge attack) Bitcoin, Bitcoin would need to support it. Bitcoin is to BU as Namecoin is to Bitcoin in terms of hashrate in this unfortunate event.

Mycelium connects to that servers run by Mycelium. You can't choose anything else there. There are some wallets which allow you to choose a node (ideally one you run yourself), i.e. Copay or trezor. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:21:48
Your username checks out :)
Please look at it from the perspective of someone who did not grow up tinkering with computers like you probably did.
Could your friend that is a cook, a marketing guy etc. set up a running node on a raspberry pi in 15 minute? I'll bet my whole fortune they can't. It would even take me, a long time computer science guy and coder, many hours to check out how the raspberry works etc., since I haven't had one so far. Come on now, even reading the howtos is bound to take you longer than 15 minutes.


Would your cook or marketing guy friend even know what "syncing" means? "Wait a week one time, wtf?". I am 100% sure though that if you just install MyCelium or some other popular mobile wallet, they could handle it within 15 minutes, realistically.
In other words: if you met a random person that asked you how to get into bitcoins, would you really recommended them getting a raspberry pi and go through tutorials? Really?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:39:51
Perfect is the enemy of good. We would still be without P2SH or similar if the two camps still fought over which was better.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:32:39


But it totally is! Maybe not for you and me who are deeply involved, but if you argue that a 3 hour wait before your transaction vs. a 1s wait is not significantly worse, you need to zoom out and get a fresh perspective on how normal users operate.
Same question to you: if you met a random person in a bar that wanted to get into Bitcoin, would you get them started with a mobile wallet, or rather explain them how to run a node? Which option do you expect to work better for the newbie?

"substantially new" is a fuzzy definition. To some, entering the fee market and a permanent backlog is a much more radical change than lifting the blocksize limit.

On the other hand, there is nothing serious published to support the opposite, either.

You are right, you didn't say the HF was a disaster b/c of price, but because of the replay attack and the accidental split between the two implementations.
It is relevant when the argument against a HF is that there are two resulting coins, but this was indeed no the topic here.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:09:43
Are you using that node to power your wallet? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:07:13
it's not really voting (node counts can easily be faked). what matters is the the wallet you use follows the right chain in case of a fork, and that you buy/hold one coin and sell the other. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:16:00
Reading this explanation, it sounds like the merged mined coin needs to explicitly support being merged mined. Does Bitcoin support being merge mined?
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:56:58
If they direct an amount of hashpower to attack Bitcoin, wouldn't they miss the same amount in mining their own coin? Or can they do both at the same time?
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:19:12
Why would the burden be on Core? They are not our overlords.
We are having this conversation because likely, a small minority is being very loud, and they happen to have a big miner on board. As I said, hashrate support probably isn't representative in this case.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:31:53


Not according to a lot of independent devs and a full ecosystem: 
I am also a dev and looked through the segwit PR. Code is looking good, the idea is looking good, the doors it opens for more scalability is mind blowing.
Flex Trans on the other hand has been reviewed and regarded as garbage by at least three respected devs. Yes, their technical arguments are objectively verifiable, even if you suggest they have an agenda or you don't like them.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:37:47


I think this is a pretty serious misunderstanding, and a common one. POW doesn't define validity. POW only chooses which of multiple valid blocks or sequences of blocks go into the main chain.
I can have more hashrate than all of bitcoin's put together. If I mine an invalid block, it doesn't do anything.

@_date: 2017-03-10 13:06:46
Why not now? Because there already is a blocksize increase (roughly equal to a 2mb hf) waiting to be activated, but with less risk. One that makes future limit increases even safer. What's not to like about it?

If hashrate alone really was the way upgrades could be forced, then they indeed would have all the power: they could change the rules of Bitcoin such that your Bitcoins are now theirs to spend, etc.
Luckily, they most likely do not have that power at all.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:50:26
I didn't say I was the economic majority. I also never implied that node count is a meaningful metric; it isn't. I guess many nodes important to the economy, i.e. ones run by blockchain.info, various exchanges, etc. are not even publicly reachable and don't show up in node counts.
That said, I do think the economic majority is running Core and has little intention of changing.  might be a good indicator. We can't know for sure until BU starts mining bigger blocks for real. I kinda hope they'll do that soon so we get some clarity on where everyone stands.

The coins in the merge mined chain probably have less value and hence less incentive to be mined consistently at the same hashrate as bitcoin.

The example where the inflation was used as a tool to fund wars and other nonsense which would not be tolerated if taxation or borrowing were the only tools.
That sounds like a government printed money and gave it directly to themselves to fund those activities. I am asking for specific examples that can be fact checked.

The actual timeline is that the attack happened before the tweet: 
Regardless, deflecting the damage to Todd and Core is entirely the wrong response. It's a pretty epic fuck up, from how the bug was introduced (no understanding, no reviews), to how long it was active (the devs apparently knew about it and ignored it), to how it was fixed (you don't reveal an exploit before the production software has been upgraded).
@_date: 2017-03-13 05:54:13
Shouldn't we at least wait until the official segwit activation deadline is over?

I hope you realize that setting up a node on a raspberry pi to have it constantly be in sync is even more a hassle than running it on your desktop/notebook.
You are kind of the elite user, as even tech savy users usually would run a node on their desktop/notebook and not tinker with raspberry pis for hours.
Edit: as a tech savy user myself, I can relate to your sentiment. To us it's worth it and not that hard. But we should seriously start to accept the fact that barriers like those are affecting the vast majority of user's decisions, and we are in the tiny minority here.
Edit2: in other words, I can tell my sister to download MyCelium easily. Electrum would already be some trouble, but if I set it up for her, she could handle it. Running her own node as a wallet? No chance in hell, even if I support her by setting it up first.

You mention ETH and ETC, and yet it is the best example that a hf is not a huge deal. The ETH fork was as contentious and as messy as a fork can get, and yet, ETH is now stronger than before the fork.

Consider this thought experiment: you create your own altcoin, remove the 21M coin limit and make yourself the central issuer.

Is your coin now Bitcoin? You can even use the same genesis block made by Satoshi. I hope this example makes it clear that your coin is not Bitcoin, because everybody else is using the Bitcoin they have always been running, even if is backed my less mining power than your own coin.
The chain with the most work is the valid chain.
That just means that the chain with the most work complying with the consensus rules is the valid chain in case there are multiple valid forks, such as two competing valid blocks (or chains of blocks) produced by different miners. Nothing more, nothing less. In that case, a "reorg" happens. This occurs regularly.
Of course, if the majority of the users get together and declare a coin with different rules "Bitcoin", so be it, but that has little to do with hashrate and everything to do with network effect.

This makes no sense. If a transaction to me happened to be mined in a 3mb block while I only processed 2mb blocks, the money would be lost. [I have been told]( that this is the reason my node has to process all blocks, no matter what size, I just don't relay the big ones.


Seeing all transactions and picking from them is a completely different thing from getting and validating a full block.


I think you are talking based on no data or experience. I guess you are not a miner. 


It can be prevented, or at the very least, not made worse than it is, if we didn't let miners choose their blocksizes. Allowing that is an easy way for big miners to force small miners to join them or die.


If everyone chooses their own sizes, but there is no signalling/grace period, then splits can easily occur. If I leave my node/miner unattended for a week, I would be forked off if the rest moved to bigger blocks than I configured. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:03:07
Not sure, but I think the data going through the node is encrypted. At the very least, it doesn't know how many hops came before or are coming after.
In any case, why do you think this is a bad thing and how does it give the node an unfair advantage? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:56:13
Consider this thought experiment: you create your own altcoin, remove the 21M coin limit and make yourself the central issuer. You are the only user of your coin, but you manage to build/buy enough miners to put in more proof of work into your chain than the total work put into the Bitcoin chain. No one else uses your coin. Is your coin now Bitcoin? You can even use the same genesis block made by Satoshi. I hope this example makes it clear that your coin is not Bitcoin, because everybody else is using the Bitcoin they have always been running, even if is backed my less mining power than your own coin.
The chain with the most work is the valid chain.
That just means that the chain with the most work complying with the consensus rules is the valid chain in case there are multiple valid forks, such as two competing valid blocks (or chains of blocks) produced by different miners. Nothing more, nothing less. In that case, a "reorg" happens. This occurs regularly.
Of course, if the majority of the users get together and declare a coin with different rules "Bitcoin", so be it, but that has little to do with hashrate and everything to do with network effect.

Adoption is at an all time high, but [what you see is not all there is]( We could have possibly had a lot more users and higher market cap.
I do not strictly categorize new users ones requiring low-fee transactions, not at all. But it cannot be argued with that new users with no strong incentive to join Bitcoin are more likely to play with it and enjoy it if they can bounce test transactions and imagine they can use it as a borderless currency. It also cannot be argued with that if a first time user gets his first coins, but they don't confirm for 12 hours, that they will be put off and not give it a second try. One can scream "wallets should be better with fees" all day long, but at the end of the day, this problem persists, [and fee estimation is not easy]( I am no BTC noob, and when I sold a newcomer his first coin with MyCelium max. priority, and it took a full day to confirm, he was worried I scammed him and was put off.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:02:50
Still, your logic about taking today's backlog and doubling because of LN doesn't make any sense. You would obviously only start a payment channel if it is better than transacting directly on the chain.

I agree. Are you implying 2mb blocks exclude peers and only allow datacenters? Segwit supports the same, so you are not implying that. Why even write something like this, then? I was just saying that we could have had 2mb a long time ago (before segwit was even invented) if people had worked together on this at the time the problem was recognized. 
I agree that now that segwit is here, it should be activated asap. It comes late and likely at a significant cost in delayed adoption and probably valuation, but I am glad it's here.

If I send you 10 btc and you send me 3 btc, the blockchain only needs to record that I sent you 7 btc. the intermediate transactions are also real bitcoin transactions and you can broadcast them if you want, but you can opt to save on transaction fees and have more private transactions by choosing to only settle the end result on the chain. All in a secure/trustless way. It's pretty awesome.

I kind of agree, but I feel like the current issues are delaying our success by years, and in the worst case by more than we can afford to - competition doesn't sleep. I also think, that even being conservative and making sure Bitcoin is successful in the long term, we could have safely and easily fixed the short term capacity problem if all worked together towards it 3 years ago when people first started pointing out the problem, so those couple of delays in progress seem like a waste.
There is nothing wrong with bridging the gap until better tech (LN, hardware) is available.

The fees might still just be too large (i.e. a lower fee would result in an unreasonable confirmation time, or possibly no confirmation ever).
Also, if you send via LN, the recipient can use the received funds in LN again. If it is an onchain tx, it first needs to go into a payment channel, incurring additional fees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:00:26


no disagreement there!


You can't do that, as the funds are locked in a 2-of-2 multisig between the sender and receiver. The coins you already sent are reflected by updates to a spend of the 2-of-2 multisig which updates both parties' balance. You can choose to broadcast the latest of those to have it included in the chain if you are inclined to.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:25:22


As says, it doesn't help anyone unless you verify them for the purpose of receiving/making transactions of your own. It doesn't help if you verify but don't make use of that information (apart from serving as a relay node to help others bootstrap).

As for coffee transactions for the world (and adoption): please read here what I wrote about it:  tl;dr: perfect is the enemy of good. By your logic: 1mb can't serve the whole world, why not go to 1kb then? It seems obvious that 1mb was an arbitrary limit, and if satoshi would have put 2 instead of 1, we would be fixing the quadratic sig problem or limit tx sizes, and continue happily without all the mess we are in now.
I meant working together towards an increase before Classic was even a thing. Gavin and others predicted that we would hit the ceiling pretty accurately, and if it was everyone's priority to avoid that, we could have made it happen. Classic arose because of the resistance to it.
You are right I can't say for sure about the valuation. It is just a personal opinion, but it seems trivial to me that having no issues with fees, no barrier to testing out bitcoin, etc. results in less people not taking a second look. It is also trivial to me that more users is good for valuation. 
Just to be clear: I agree that the way classic und BU are handling things is not good at all (politically as well as technically).

We have been able to do it for the first 7 years of Bitcoin's life, and that we should stop right at this arbitrary moment of 1mb and cannot sustain further growth is silly.

As I said, we don't have to jump from zero to serving the whole world with coffee, just the current demand.
I agree that LN is the way forward, but it is a mistake to stall progress and adoption for a tech that is not ready yet. We could have easily bridged those 2-3 years with a blocksize increase, not hindering adoption.


It is good that we have LN, but even without it, you don't know if we could sustain this traffic with a 10 minute blocktime in the future. Just realize the incredible progress tech has made only in the last 20 years. It would have been absolutely inconceivable back then to assume that we could have terabytes of data on a small flash drive and stream 4k movies in realtime from the internet. Maybe tech will make breakthroughs where we could easily send terabyte blocks in 10 minute windows in 20 years time.
In any case, perfect is the enemy of good. Just because we can't go from 1mb to 1gb blocks or serve the whole world it is no reason we shouldn't do incremental improvements.
Yes, segwit is here now, but we could have had 2mb blocks for over a year now (planning for that started 3 years ago, mind you) if some people wouldn't have aggressively stalled progress on that.
Edit: small anecdote relating to adoption. When fees were negligible, I and many I know would draw people in by sending them test transactions back and forth and literally buying coffee and beers. If a new person wants to quickly test bitcoin and every test costs them 20 cents, 50 cents etc., they won't play with it. A big selling point of btc is using it as borderless currency. A much easier entry than "this is digital gold". None of my friends care about gold, all of them care about that they have a mess with converting into foreign currencies when travelling and slow payments.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:40:34

Historically, the space used has increased step by step. 1mb blocks were not full for a long time. So history shows you that spammers are not filling the blocks just for the sake of it.
Besides, the most elegant solution to the problem is not to care about spam, because there is no good objective definition of it.

Thx for indulging me.
I am not sure how one can argue that there is not a pressing issue when so many spoke out about it being an issue. Most recently Xapo's Wences told an an interview that the adoption rate slowdown correlated to increased fees is real. The latest in a series of many high profile people in the space have an issue with this. 
Slower rate of adoption falls into the category of fallacies of "ignoring what you can't see" (from "Thinking fast and slow"). In other words, for the people using Bitcoin today, there is little problems indeed, but we can't see all the people that are not using Bitcoin that would have.


That is what has been tried, three times.

@_date: 2016-11-18 13:23:30
When people started pushing for the increase, the blocks were not full, but anticipated to become full, and since rolling out the increase takes time, you better start before it happens. That was the rationale, at least.
Among the people who favor(ed) bigger blocks, I think a majority agrees that eventually, a fee market needs to exist to replace the block subsidy, but think it is more important to keep growing for now and get more people on board instead of cutting them out prematurely. 




The resources a node and pool have are not free, so there is a natural minimum fee to consuming those resources. In the same spirit, if the blocksize limit did not exist, miners wouldn't create infinite-sized blocks and include everyone's transactions, because of their limited resources. To reduce processing power, bandwidth, orphaning rates etc., a natural upper limit would merge. 
So a backlog and fees will exist, but it does not have to be imposed by a fixed limit.
Of course it is hard to tell if those ideas are valid and hold up when actually rolled out this way. On the other hand, shutting people out and having a backlog are also changes that were not tested before, and we were fine going into that with no real world validation too.

I see your point, I do. It is just that I don't believe that it wouldn't have worked if Core had put their mind and heart to it. Increasing the limit to 2mb and setting some other limits to avoid the quadratic sig thing for blowing up, and deploying it could surely have been done easily within 2 years. At that time, it was even the best known solution (as I said, segwit was not even a thing then).

So I do see that XT, as a failed attempt, generates a lot of frustration on your side. But just claming that anyone who liked it is ill-intentioned is simply wrong. I am a fairly big stake holder and want nothing more than Bitcoin to succeed. I can have a different opinion which does not make me ill-intentioned!
As to your points:
There is no such thing as dictator, only owner over your codebase. Just as I can't commit to the Core repo b/c someone else is taking care of that. You can always fork and do your thing if your "dictator" does something bad.
8GB many years down the road. Do you remember the initial bump? You state it in a misleading fashion (as if the limit would immediately go to 8GB). I hope it is not intentional of you.
It most certainly did not try to create a contentious hard fork, because it activates only with a majority. You can also turn this around: the current Bitcoin is also contentious. Status quo has an unfair bias, and it was achieved extremely arbitrarily (Satoshi hardly picked 1MB with great care, it could just as well have been 2 or 10MB). 
I do not like the vicious attacks. This argument is irrelevant to XT's merit, though.
@_date: 2016-11-17 23:41:45
How can you even dare accusing people like Gavin and Mike not to be well intentioned, when both have spend years and years and a ton of effort to advance Bitcoin and its ecosystem. What the fuck dude.

The change is not about that. It is about disconnecting them even before the fork happens, while every client is 100% compatible.
They seem to have good reasons for it, but it is not just disconnecting clients on a different fork.
@_date: 2016-11-18 00:20:19
Segwit came like 3 years after the first calls for an increase were made, and a good 1.5 years later after it has been seriously discussed and pushed. In all that time we could have surely pulled of a safe and uncontentious hard fork to 2mb, seeing that Core agrees to a capacity increase in general.
I see that Segwit can be activated now and help everybody, but it remains a fact that there was zero compromise on Core's part when there has been ample time to do that and avoid the community divide. Do you think it would have been worth it if it had avoided the divide and the resulting delays in progress, in hindsight?

4 or 8 times better is pretty significant, think about it.
Also: perfect is the enemy of good. With your logic, we could go down to 50kb, because fuck it, blocks are going to be full anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:42:31
Mining power has nothing to do with the capacity. Miners compete to find the next block, that's it.
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:16:15
I think this is at the heart of the disagreement. I think that perfect is the enemy of good, so while the segwit features are of course great, just bumping the 1mb to 2mb and installing the other limits to prevent quadratic blowup could have been implemented and deployed a year before segwit was even thought of, if everyone had put their minds to it. 
I want an imperfect solution that can be fixed/improved later, but solves the pressing issue, rather than wait for the perfect solution that comes two years later.

It's not completely irrelevant. At least it shows that the "social contract" of what Bitcoin has been breached, without full consensus that this was a good idea.
If you had to divide the two camps by a fork, the side that would be "morally" obliged to fork away and create a new coin would be the small blockers, not the big blockers. I am aware that no one gives a shit about social contracts and morality and it would be irrational for either side to fork away, but the Bitcoin paper at least shows what is what.

It has nothing to do with the dollar per se, it's just about purchasing power. If all bitcoins in existence combined cannot pay for one loaf of bread, it's obviously not a very useful currency.
"relative to the dollar" is a misguided concept. For example, the true unit of Bitcoin is a Satoshi. One Bitcoin is hundred million Satoshis. A dollar, relative to a satoshi, has much higher value, but it does not mean much.

Yes it would be unusable because there wouldn't be enough value in the system to cover all the activity. If 1 bitcoin = 1 dollar, you could not have 500 persons in the world buy a car on the same day in bitcoin, because the combined value is more than exists in the system.

This is not very clear to me. If a miner pushes 40mb blocks and no other miner can handle it, the other miners will orphan it by not building on top of it. If all other miners have a combined &gt;50% share, the rogue miner will have to adjust to have his blocks be accepted. 
A weaker argument but maybe still important is that a miner would be stupid to overreach in market share b/c the btc community wouldn't accept one miner having &gt;50%.
We also need to be aware what "decentralization" means exactly when we talk about it. I.e. is centralized mining a critical risk seeing that the community can fix it if that miner does something fishy (or comes close to be able to even try something fishy?). Those are difficult questions to me, I am just writing down some ideas that might not match reality.
@_date: 2017-08-28 06:10:30

If Core had supported a HF long before Segwit as softfork was even known to work (even before Segwit was developed in general), do you really think it would have been a problematic fork? Obviously Core is pro 2mb (as Segwit is sth close to the equivalent of that). I blame the lack of progress and the huge infight also on their inability to just compromise and move on. It is called "soft skills".
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:44:05
Do both. Re-buy what you use.
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:48:57
Core did not know a soft fork solution existed for years during which a HF blocksize fixes were proposed. I remember a time when most miners and many others agreed on 8mb. That was right before segwit was described at scaling HK.
You can say what you want, but there has been *zero* compromise from Bitcoin core and plenty from Gavin et al. We could have easily done a safe upgrade, even with a 1.5 years activation time, but they wouldn't have any of it.
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:37:35
Just to check: ledger, trezor, mycelium, copay are all compatible? I.e. the same seed can be imported into any of those and you would get the same derivation?
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:47:06
Sorry, another small question:
If I wanted to generate a hardware wallet seed without actually owning one, I could use Copay offline to do that, and buy a HW wallet in the future to safely spend the funds?
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:11:28

By your logic, we should shut down Bitcoin right away. The resources it consumes could instead be put to saving lives instead, right?
You are using sympathy to sway decision making. The right approach is empathy, not sympathy. The latter leads to more harm than good, actually (there is good research on it I am too lazy to look up now; it's been on EconTalk).


That is very hard to estimate, but if it would tip Bitcoin to hit mainstream and as a result, people take back control over their money, it would be worth every penny. Obviously it would be something in the middle, but it wouldn't be wasted.

It apparently wasn't all that clear. He stated many times that outside of rbitcoin or some very loud individuals, mostly everyone he engaged with wanted to see bigger blocks sooner than later, and he got a big user base complaining about high fees or delayed transactions constantly. Again, give him the benefit of the doubt. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:02:06
Where do you source your tainted inputs from? They need to lead back to a coinbase tx after the fork, right?
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:48:39
What's clear to you isn't clear to everybody. Not everybody associates with the same group, and bitcoin is bigger than rbitcoin. He probably refers to his own large customer base for reference, which is pretty powerful in its own right.
I agree it was misguided and could have been called off more quickly, but again: benefit of the doubt, for the sake of building a constructive community instead of burning valuable bridges.

They are most certainly spendable. It would be the equivalent of a mere one time 5% inflation of the btc supply. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:50:45
Businesses need to reorient a bit if they depend on mega blocks and compromising on security to make it. Alyse Killeen put it well in her Breaking Bitcoin appearance. 
Customers want cheapest fees, and if PayPal is cheaper for them and they don't require a secure censorship resistant ledger, good for them. Bitcoin's success so far demonstrated that there are use cases for a censorship resistant ledger despite the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:45:50
Even after 2x with 95% of miner support failed due to a lack of user support, and after segwit was activated despite big miner opposition, you still think miners get to decide? How many more examples do we need to go through until people realize?

@_date: 2017-11-15 14:55:13
You sent btc there though, not bch. And still, you knew the fork was happening, so ask the exchange upfront or take control.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:44:21
A thing like 95% is an activation threshold to coordinate an upgrade, as a favor to miners so they have some time to implement the changes. It was never a voting mechanism.
Since they tried to abuse this favor with blocking segwit, we likely won't have this kind of signaling anymore. Maybe in combination with a flag date upgrade, or only a flag date upgrade.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:07:20
Edit: sorry, reading my post again I see it sounds a bit aggressive or accusatory, which was not my intention. I highly respect what you are doing and the various blog/reddit posts you shared regarding scaling and fees. Thanks for being transparent and reasonable!
Are you willing to help Bitcoin scale exponentially by supporting development and/or integration of Lightning?
Are you using RBF? You could automatically bump the fee if the delay is longer than expected.
Slightly off topic, but please also consider atomic swaps. This would guarantee that funds can't get stuck with ShapeShift. Further down the line, you could be matchmaker for trustless trading between your clients.

Few people have a big issue with that. 2x doesn't solve a different problem though. It also doesn't try to be another competitor, but tries to replace Bitcoin completely with all sorts of unfair play.
You have to pick a side if you are interested because BTC doesn't remain safe and robust against attacks by people doing nothing. It does so by having people fight for it.

No way. Satoshi can sell his coins only once. If there is a flash crash, it would recover as people realize that a one time 6.5% inflation is not a major thing and nothing else changed.
Besides, even if Satoshi moves a satoshi, it is very unlikely they would attempt to liquidate all of it in any case.

So you think that if Erik doesn't respond to you personally, he didn't write plenty about the topic? I even a gave you a link where he specifically talks about it, which refutes everything you say.

Erik might have done the "wrong" thing in your opinion, but he has explained his reasoning many times, always polite, and backed up with sensible arguments (even if you disagree with them).
For example, the reason not to have replay protection so the fork is opt-in by default to ensure a smooth upgrade is not extremely stupid, if the proposal had consensus. Light clients would not all have to be updated, etc. Now that it became clear the fork did not have consensus, he agreed to cancel it.
Try to give him the benefit of the doubt and look up to him again, like you did. Everyone is emotional and doesn't see clearly anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:54:06
I see. What about Bitcoin blocks before we hit the limit? They were mostly empty and growing over time. I guess the same applies with the minrelayfee, but still, it seems the chain is not abused much even with plenty of space.

I see where you are coming from, but it's not completely absurd.
If you read the title of the whitepaper, you'll get a good idea: **P2P Cash**. It is the core proposition of Bitcoin, and the chance that Satoshi changed his mind on that is next to zero. Even if he did, he's not around to tell it anymore, but the whitepaper is, and there is no doubt many signed on because they wanted P2P cash, as proposed by the whitepaper.

Maybe, we'll just have to see. It's at least plausible that it was never about the blocksize, but about stirring up debate in order to stall segwit in order to prolong their epic asicboost profits.
Now that everyone knows that asicboost exists, there should be no problem killing the version of it that conflicts with segwit and still allow the other forms. After that, we can see whether they'll keep fighting segwit as vigorously as before. 
(don't forget that segwit is a real honest to God blocksize limit increase, despite all the FUD)

@_date: 2017-04-20 17:38:56
No one minds competition between miners. 
It's a problem when miners are not aligned with users. In this case, asicboost seems to give a miner the incentive to act against the bitcoin users and block something that is much needed and ready to be deployed by the vast majority of users. 
If it didn't do that, no one would cry about them using asicboost. In fact, Greg's softfork proposal specifically does not kill asicboost, just a certain form of it which creates this misaligned incentive to block segwit. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:17:04
It certainly isn't. It adds more rules, this is by definition more complicated. One can debate if it is significant or not, but it's there.

Conspiracy theory. It is equally likely that the Bitcoin community at large is starting to be fed up with this shit.
Whether there is a campaign to uncover it or not, if the dirt is real and is a real threat, it should be taken seriously. The stuff uncovered are not lies, after all. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:18:53
That is like advantage number  of segwit. The other 9 apply equally well to Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:33:59
Some of them would be, but who says they represent the economic majority?
I have some coins, and I have better ways to make money than gamble on future markets.
Also, is futures market really the right thing? I am all for UASF, but since I can't know if it will happen yet, I wouldn't be buying those futures 100%, but maybe 50%/50%.
@_date: 2017-04-11 06:33:32
How do we coordinate this? Economic majority sounds extremely vague. Any way to know before the flag day whether it's safe to upgrade? 
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:56:15
I agree. That is not the topic at hand though, which is that some miners claim that miners are in control of the consensus rules.
In the case of ASICBoost, the balance is skewed, in that one miner can make ridiculous profits by doing something that does not align with what users want. If your short term gain is say $100 million per year, then this is totally worth it, since it's not reasonable to expect that the price of the coin would rise this dramatically to give them the same profit if they fell in line and did what the users wanted.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:46:42
There is no 95% consensus that you can measure. 95% is the usual threshold used for signaling by miners to activate a softfork. This is about coordination, not voting. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:29:56
Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one: no one had a clue that asicboost was the reason for the segwit blockage until extblocks was proposed and they jumped on it, so it wasn't a priority earlier.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:43:22
MW is in no way related to segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:57:36
If the exchanges and users etc. don't switch to BU, we're safe, as they won't even mine BU themselves (the coins there would be near worthless).
If they wanna piss away infinite amounts of money to attack our chain (unlikely), we'll swap the PoW algo and kill their business altogether.
I wonder if they can merge mine BU and Bitcoin, or if attacking Bitcoin means the hashes are taken away from BU.
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:52:37
Yes, miners signal for coordination to activate rules already widely deployed. What is your point?
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:01:47
It can't be proven. There is a shitload of evidence though. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:17:54

This was a valid argument 1.5 years ago. Now, most wallets already support it.

Wrong, users do that. Segwit wouldn't happen if all miners were in favor but only half the users. Miners' **only** job is to order transactions to prevent double spends.


Exactly! Because users define what Bitcoin is, not miners. That's the whole point.
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:38:23
That is the fun part: miners need users more. Not all miners are gonna reject if if all users are gonna force it; there will always some miners that would support it to cover us. We can easily afford to lose even 80% of hashing power (the network had less a year ago if I'm not mistaken!).
If 80% or 90% of miners want to quit it, the gap will quickly be filled with new competition wanting to make money.
@_date: 2017-04-12 23:11:29
Those are separate issues. I defend their right to be selfish, but I can still hate them, and the UASF is the selfish response. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:44:36
You can have 80% of all miners try to push a change. If the users don't want it, those 80% of miners will mine blocks that will be rejected, with block rewards they can't sell, etc.
@_date: 2017-04-23 07:35:04
Then mining should be so decentralized that it's infeasible to do this. It's not, so why not make use of it?

Segwit has like 10 benefits, only one of them is bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:44:44
What is your point?
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:28:51


I feel like the Bitcoin community cares a whole lot about this, as evidenced by the slow upgrade process and seeking of overwhelming consensus. SegWit is just the first time where the overwhelming consensus of users is not reflected by overwhelming consensus by miners, so people get confused and forget that the users are the people giving the coin its value, not the miners. There will always be miners for a valuable coin, there is no problem there.
@_date: 2017-04-20 17:45:27
As you said, hashrate is a good way to trigger a change, as in, coordinate it. It's mostly a favour to miners. In the past, some miners had trouble upgrading in time, and manually communicating and delaying flag days became impractical. 
The downside of changing updates from flagdays to hashrate is that people forgot that users decide the change, and miners follow (or are left behind mining a worthless coin). 
Note that even if a majority of miners act against the wishes of the economic majority (blocking a change or trying to enforce new rules), they'll quickly be replaced by lucky new miners who'll gladly step up and make money. 
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:41:49


Explain how.


Yeah... no. They are not terrorists. The users hold all the power, negotiating just speeds up the process and makes the change smoother. Don't overplay it.
@_date: 2017-04-01 05:10:33
you are talking completely out of your ass. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 22:57:33


Yup. If it was technically superior to segwit, it should get priority. Looks like it isn't, though.
@_date: 2017-04-20 09:27:13
I didn't say we didn't need miners. The point is that we need them for ordering transactions only, not to enforce consensus rules. 
Also, there will always be miners as long as the coin is valuable. If a miner can't align with what the users want, we can do without that particular miner, others will gladly take the spot to earn some money. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:44:13

Let's say one double spends succeeds, but no more. Would you be willing to shut down all of Bitcoin for a few days because of it? If so, your priorities are wrong in my opinion.
What is the damange of one double spend, and what is the cost of the whole network being unavailable for a day? Obviously, the latter is many times more damaging in terms of lost money.
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:09:12
Well, either they don't understand it, but it's more likely they understand it and spread this misinformation to increase their power or prolong their asic boost profits. 
Miners were never in charge of enforcing consensus, users are. Signaling is a coordination mechanism for activating already widely deployed changes, that's it. If miners try to enforce new rules like increasing the block reward, which they tried (!!), their blocks are rejected by the user nodes so t's obvious who enforces consensus: the users.
@_date: 2017-04-24 07:21:32

 Miners are also users, but a small minority compared to the rest.


Since they seem to be spreading BS ("miners enforce consensus" is simply objectively wrong) and blocking advancements that pretty much everyone else wants. Miners are there to order transactions only, nothing more. If they step out of line, they need to be reminded of that.


It did happen, no one noticed because the blocks were rejected of course.
Even then, my point stands: imagine a miner trying something like that, or any other change you can think of which doesn't have consensus among user nodes. What would happen? Exactly, nothing, because users enforce consensus.
Honestly I am not even sure what point you are arguing. This thread started out with a miner saying that miners control consensus rules and can change them, which is wrong. You are defending the miners, which is fine (I also appreciate that they i invested this much into securing Bitcoin), but I really hope you don't believe them when they say that they are the guys in control of the Bitcoin consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:25:12

You missed what I said. PoW only coordinates which of multiple **valid** chains to follow. When there are multiple, a reorg happens, and this happens regularly.

That is not the reason, because 95% of miner support doesn't imply 95% of user support, so it is not about contentiousness. It is simply to reduce the risk of unusually big reorgs during the transition.

You realize that things take time, right? Altcoins need time to implement and deploy it and get an ecosystem going to make their coin valuable.


Did you have your eyes closed when Litecoin's price tripled when segwit signaling reached 70%? It is likely the price will stay there or go higher when it in fact activates.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:38:37
Maybe, but this sounds like the taxi drivers that want to regulate uber drivers off the market to maintain their position, instead of finding a way to be profitable on their own merit.
In your example, this just means that it is not a viable business model to spend 5 years and a million dollars to develop something that is easy to knock off and make cheaper. Who says the world needs this? In a non-patent world, those people would spend their time on something that has better chances of succeeding instead.
Don't forget that there is an equal amount of counter arguments to patents, i.e. it stops innovation and productivity when patents are handed out for trivial stuff, or patents last so long that there is an overall loss for society not being able to build on the work.


Patents cannot be part of a free market, because they are enforced by law, not by the market. This is a separate discussion from whether it is a good thing or not.


No one cares about that.


This is the problem indeed. As Cohen said:

You argued that there should be *no* changes, not only not controversial ones. Don't forget that SW is a softfork and as such you can stay behind if you want and use coin without the advancements.
A new coin for every change is obviously excessive. What's the point of it anyway, assuming that Bitcoin would lose against the new coins that keep up with the state of the art? Or do you think Bitcoin would increase in value even if it stagnates forever?

You can choose not to support that, but in doing that you are harming both sides of the fork in the future. Just saying.
You are also not going tweaking other things in the P2P protocol as you like without properly studying the implications. You should either do that or leave it to the dozens of people that did it for you.

Much work that is based on segwit has been not pursued as actively as it could have been because it wasn't activated. It wasn't certain if it was gonna activate this year or only in a year, so in the meantime there was other work to be done.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:21:43
That was about segwit, not off chain tx. But they argue agains that too. They change opinions a lot and just fight whatever Core is in favor of.
SegWit wasn't unpopular in the beginning either, and Roger himself said he supported it, until it became a convenient thing to attack.

You don't want another hard fork fiasco like in 2013 when we switched to LevelDB just because a rushed fix to an attack that takes millions of dollars and months of preparation time to perform.
In general: rushing fixes only makes sense if the attack is publicly known. Otherwise you make the attack known and possibly exploitable, as not everyone upgrades in a day.

Email spam is different as it's filtered locally in either your client or your mail provider (which you can choose). No one but you decide what you consider spam. A mail spammer is still free to spam (as I said, objectively defining spam is a slippery slope / impossible and leads to censorship).
Not so much in Bitcoin, where the spam would have to be filtered by miners or all the nodes, not by yourself.
@_date: 2017-09-08 07:42:39
Not exactly fruitless, but kind of. If you develop something which can only be used in one or two years in the future, you run the risk that by that time, things look different or you had better data or better ideas to do the same thing, etc.
Similar for segwit, yes, but with that there is also the fact that before it activated, you couldn't deploy the software making use of it, and release cycles can take a while. We will see more and more use of it, i.e. Bitstamp announced the switch, which is impressive.
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:58:18
I of course see the point. Still, Bitcoin is meant to mean sovereignty and responsibility. You can verify it yourself, so you should. If they try to give people the wrong coins, and everyone complains and leaves as a result, they won't do it anymore. This is how the free market is supposed to work, isn't it?
By your logic, all BTC exchanges should also be highly regulated, because of all the manipulation and insider trading going on. I thought we figured that this regulation crap belongs to the corrupt legacy sysem.

If that was the definition, the spammer would pay slightly more and there would be a lot of innocent tx falling victim that are just trying to find the cheapest fee.

Alyse Killeen's talk about this at Breaking Bitcoin is interesting:
In a panel she's in at the conference she mentions that companies have a natural tendency to think centralized, and it takes time for them to learn to embrace decentralization and not try to fix Bitcoin's consensus rules everytime it doesn't work as centralized solutions usually do. Maybe Coinbase and Shapeshift also fell victim to this, and needs to re-orient a bit if they think that doing things like segwit2x is necessary to grow their business.

You could argue we started to need it when blocks became full like 1.5-2 years ago, before segwit was a thing, and when fees skyrocketed.

So we turn to the law whenever we need it, but otherwise praise how Bitcoin is decentralized and a free market? 
That is not how this should work. The way to beat segwit2x is to sell it to the ground. not by suing people involved with it. If you wanted to make your own improvement of Bitcoin that you deem legit, you wouldn't want to be sued either. This is how innovation happens.

You have a logical error in your reasoning. Falkvinge said it's dumb to think that *every* user should be running a node, not that it's dumb to think that *any* user should be running a node.

I don't disagree, but it's not easy. Not everyone can run a full node today either, there is always a cut off. Where exactly that cut off is fairly arbitrary. Some, like Rick, think the cutoff can be higher without a loss of value. 
A model where you have only corporate entities running nodes could also work if you can switch easily from one to another if one starts to censor/abuse you. Not saying I'd like it, but it's a reasonable position to take, especially seeing that the vast majority of btc users are on Coinbase and similar centralized solutions.

0 conf today has more or less the same security it always had. You can accept them and mitigate the risks, but they are not secure. The risk of a double-spent zero conf transaction was always non-zero, but it is zero with LN.
I am not discussing how risky zero conf tx are for your particular use case, but it is a fact that LN is perfectly secure, while normal zero conf transactions are not perfectly secure.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:43:23


I don't know! I guess a leap of faith is needed, and that leap can be minimized if major exchanges and wallets cooperate.
 &gt;Isn't this question one of the reasons Bitcoin exists and uses PoW in the first place?
That is a frequent misconception. PoW exists to resolve ambiguities among two valid blocks (or chains of valid blocks), and in that case, a reorg happens. This happens daily and that is the *only* purpose of PoW. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:19:36


So how exactly is this safer than a HF when there is a real risk of a chain split?
Also, it sure isn't past the point of no return. You can always return to the normal Bitcoin client if it doesn't take off.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:48:09
Hmm it doesn't look as trivial as I first thought. I imagined sending a tx where spending from it must be different on each chain, and maybe one can build such a script.
If segwit outputs indeed look like anyone-can-spend for non-upgraded nodes (I am still confused as to whether that is the case as nullc repeatedly said it wasn't like that), then a risky way to split it is to just send money to a segwit address and spend it on the segwit chain first, then on the non-segwit chain.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:04:26
I am not high, thx. Before RBF and full blocks you could still easily double spend, and people did.
I know the risk is small and negligible in many scenarios, and I wasn't debating that point. Just the trivially true fact that LN for the first time provides **secure** (as in, you can't double spend no matter how hard you tried) zero conf transactions.
Also, you focus on this point and are ignoring that LN tx are orders of magnitudes cheaper than what onchain tx can ever provide, no matter the blocksize, and that LN tx are much more private (more private than Bitcoin proper, and even more so than SPV nodes).
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:18:20
This is reckless. There is no good reason to not store it in a safer medium than your brain.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:26:29
Segwit is considered a safe blocksize limit increase, so definitely not never. Despite all the FUD, segwit is a real blocksize limit increase.
That said, I hope you can take a step back and check what the value proposition of Bitcoin really is. In my mind, the **only** thing it fundamentally sets it apart from legacy financial systems is *permissionless access and censorship resistance*. Everything else is a nice bonus. In that regard, we must be sure that those properties don't die a slow death by doing premature unsafe changes.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:55:35
I am not a shill, thanks. I just don't use reddit a lot outside of discussing btc, but I do frequent some other subs as well (some coding subs and some tv show subs). In other subs I just lurk.
It's also insulting that you think I am shill, considering that I post in favor of both sides frequently, accept it when I get corrected, and bring up reasonable arguments. Don't you think it's reasonable that people don't want to risk reducing decentralization and censorship resistance and move more slowly to ensure this property?
Reasonable people can disagree.
If the tech community says that 20mb blocks will be a huge centralization pressure, I believe it, yes. I also think the argument is compelling that the move to 2mb is viable because simulations have shown that a reasonable limit is at 4mb, and segwit has stuff in it to mitigate the issues of bigger blocks.
It's also hard to see why you don't accept segwit and all the epic scaling tech it enables, considering that it has been thoroughly reviewed and tested and is literally a risk free deployment (if activated by miners, not UASF), whereas HF are decidedly not risk free.
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:13:53

We will see, I guess. At least in theory, you don't have to move out of LN ever (you get paid in LN, you buy your coins from exchanges on LN, you spend on LN, ...). In reality, there will probably be some middle ground, and an optimal equilibrium will be found by market forces.

1. I get your point, but fees have gone up by a factor of 20x compared two a few years ago, which is more than what the BTC price did.
2. The price of Bitcoin has still done extremely well, despite the high fees. Looks like a double win for the miners.

@_date: 2017-05-28 21:41:08
I researched it enough, thanks. As I said, if users enforce it, the mining won't stay 70/30 like it is today, but it will quickly converge to almost everyone mining the new chain. If users don't enforce it, nothing happens.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:23:20
It wouldn't be hard. For the same reason UASF works, a user vetoed hard fork also works.
You can split of course, but if not all the users follow, you'll be wasting a lot of money, so you won't do it.

@_date: 2017-05-15 01:42:34
To be fair, Bitcoin had low fees and non-full blocks for most of its lifetime, and it was a fundamental change when we entered the full block era. By the same logic, having full blocks should have been tested on alts first.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:48:52
Bitcoin price doubled in a last couple of months. Theoretically, this alone sustains the same mining network at half the average fee rate.
Price is 6x it was a year ago. So the fee rate could drop by 6x and still sustain the same network.
The exact fee amount is not very important for the health of the network, at least for now.
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:58:10
Segwit is not only 2mb, but paves the way for Mast and Schnorr, which allows you to fit 2x the amount of transactions into the same space, so it behaves like 4mb blocks, but without the downsides.
This + LN gives plenty of room for growth. In parallel, more blocksize change proposals can be considered, as well as other kinds of scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:10:37
What would be the point of that? They can signal segwit right now if segwit2x does nothing else than change the bit.
Edit: looks like it's about changing the activation threshold. Not sure why another signaling bit is needed for that, though.

Which is ...? There has been plenty of onchain scaling, and segwit is another one in a long list of onchain scaling improvements.


Lots of, i.e. them admitting that they built it into the hardware and used it on testnet. They claim they'd never use it on mainnet, but that is obvious bullshit. Why spend so much time and money to build it into the hardware if you don't intend on using it?

Nice idea. I also don't have two different brands of HW wallets at the moment though.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:03:55


Not really. The amount today is stored in a 64 bit field, which is vastly bigger. You could divide the smallest unit into another ~10000 and still be able to spend all units in existence in a 64 bit field.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:57:02
Bitcoin has historically only used UASF, so it's not like it's a new thing. bip9 was introduced as a favor to miners to coordinate the upgrade, because some had trouble upgrading in time for the flagday, etc. We can go back anytime.
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:17:36
How practical is that? Any software that enables this setup?
The closest I could find awhile back was Copay+Trezor multisig, which is still better than just the Trezor of course.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:01:59
Not saying they aren't risky, but the same applies to UASF. Either everyone is on board, or there is disruption, just like with a HF.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:55:41
$120 fee is a bug though, but yeah, the problem is still real.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:31:55
You cannot have a more contentious fork than between ETH and ETC. And even after that, there is a very clear winner.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:53:02


I didn't say **everyone** goes through a single node.
You still have 10,000 (or according to Decker, ~50,000) LN nodes that do the full routing algo, and above that, the rest defers routing to one (or a a handful) of those running LN nodes. It is strictly better than Bitcoin nodes + SPV.


I already mentioned that LN transactions are onion routed, so the node has no idea about what the transaction contains and who it is going to (I think, I'd need to double check the status).
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:46:43


They didn't think so when Segwit wasn't a thing yet and the only reasonable proposal was a HF. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 02:12:23
But why should the mod team arbitrarily decide which is which? I for one wanted to intelligently discuss many of the proposals back in the day (XT, Classic), but all the threads were deleted. A HF to 2mb is a reasonable proposition to discuss for example, but discussions were disallowed.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:15:52
That would be interesting to see. The link though only shows him arguing what you say about him, but about the rbtc people (i.e. first using it when it's in their favor, and forgetting about it when it's not).
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:01:01


And again:


Even before segwit, the goal was the same: a safe capacity increase. Before segwit, such thing didn't exist.


This is not correct.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:20:41
Pulling off a profitable 51% attack is very difficult, and the moment it happens, it will be public and the situation dealt with.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:03:30
Except for the incentive to be sure that the transaction you receive is valid.
No big deal though, right? It's not like one of Bitcoin's only advantages over anything else is trustlessness...
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:17:42


Good point!


same for bip148 nodes. They only reject non-signalling blocks, segwit would still be activated according to bip9.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:16:51
Maybe some might have used this argument, but I don't think most would agree with it. In fact, most core devs are on record supporting bigger blocks provided their deployment is safe.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:07:54
Let's be real, 500kb, 1mb or 2mb blocks doesn't make a significant difference in full node counts. Light nodes are so much more convenient to use that the chain size really doesn't play into the decision at all.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:16:28
Luckily some people have bigger minds and know that moving Bitcoin forward will reward him many times over, and will also drive more users to his business.

Because it doesn't exist. There is no representative poll you can take. What's wrong with just picking a side and seeing how things go? You can always switch to the more valuable chain if you picked the wrong side.

30% is plenty to sustain the network.
Also, more miners will join or rejoin because this is where the profits are.

So why didn't they increase their mining reward yet?
If 100% of the miners changed any consensus rule, their blocks would literally not be accepted or relayed by any node, and they couldn't sell their mining reward.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:17:18


Any arguments why you think that? Otherwise, it's just a conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:56:58
So why didn't the miners increase their mining reward yet? After all, all of them must want more money. And if all of them do it, we have to follow along, don't we?
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:49:10


You are aware that something else correlates with the decline of full nodes, which is far more likely to be the main cause than the chain size: the emergence of usable light clients like Electrum and MyCelium etc.
I really hope people will stop spreading the misinformation that the chain size is the main cause for the decline in nodes. It's seems disingenuous, as I can't believe you really think this is the main cause, when it's trivial that running a full node is just way more of a hassle than using a light client, regardless of chain size.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:47:26
I wasn't there when they decided to use a new version bit, so I don't know if that was Barry's idea or how they arrived at that agreement.
The agreement in general is incredibly vague, which also makes it look like it's a stalling technique. But maybe that is not Barry's intention. How does he profit from stalling segwit?
Edit: what is this btc1 account, and who created it? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:18:49


Yes, but they will give that reason for 1mb blocks, 2mb blocks or 100kb blocks. A full node will always suck compared to a light client from a convenience/usability perspective. The drop in nodes is still primarily because everyone can use light clients now whereas before, if you wanted to play, you pretty much had to run a full node.
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:17:19
I also want to have everything, but sometimes reality is different.
By the way, those people you are talking about can still use SPV wallets to great effect, or people can pool to run a node if it's to expensive (share one among 100 friends).
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:51:48
What's the point of that? It can live independently. Should everything that exists in Bitcoin be put into the official client? 
In fact, the opposite should happen, i.e. bitcoin-qt should be moved out of the core repo as it is just another wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:59:31
Realistically speaking, bip148 / 1. Aug. is unrealistic, it's just too little time. That doesn't mean UASF is a bad idea in general, and sipa didn't imply as much. nullc said the same thing multiple times as well (uasf=cool, bip148=uncool).
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:18:25
It is if you have &lt;50% of the mining on board. The idea is that won't happen, but it's not risk-free.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:46:14
UASF / BIP148 implies the users enforce the it. If they do, there is zero chance. 
The miners right now could try to hard fork to emergent consensus or whatever. If they did, it would be a hard fork, but it's not an issue if no one follows them; they would have created a tiny useless altcoin. The same thing happens if a split occurs in Bip148: rogue miners that don't like to earn money fork off and do their own thing (until they realize how much money they leave on the table and rejoin the game).
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:15:31
It's funny, all the arguments you brought forward were also said when segwit wasn't a thing and people wanted a hard fork.
Now that it's about segwit, many of the risks of a HF exist in the Aug. 1st UASF, but you are finding counter arguments as to why it's still safe.
Most, if not all of those apply to the concerns about hard forks.
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:57:05
The discount is not required at all. It was introduced to better align the cost of a tx with the cost of the resources it incurs in terms of a growing UTXO set.

Segwit allows bigger blocks...
It's not that one side likes big blocks and the other doesn't, virtually everyone wants bigger blocks.

@_date: 2017-05-23 05:41:17


Only if the economic majority of the users are on that chain, otherwise, it's quite worthless and there is no incentive for a miner to mine that chain.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:16:43
I am not baffled, because a SF is trivially safer than a HF, and segwit does the same as a 2mb HF plus a lot more nice things.
the goal is not HF for the sake of HF, but increaed capacity/scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:54:30
It's easy to split them.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:49:25
If not at least one major exchange and wallet provider supports it by the lock in date, it will be clear there is no majority, and people won't enforce it. No one likes disruption and losing money as a consequence.
@_date: 2017-05-11 04:44:57


Many arguments are being thrown around that are not very meaningful. I am just pointing out that this one for sure was not the one that managed to block anything, as almost no one agrees with it.


Because SPV nodes don't give you secure, cheap, instant confirmation transactions, and don't help with scaling at all.
Also, LN nodes are private, whereas SPV nodes are not.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:48:25


But they are. UASF nodes will reject nodes not signalling segwit. Miners signalling segwit today will produce valid blocks for UASF nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:09:40
Yeah I also don't think node counts and twitter polls are usable. The only real measure is to see what happens when the flag date comes and you stick to one chain or another. Either you will be able to use your coins, or you won't and you will switch to the other chain.
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:05:08
It's only a chain split if the economic majority is not behind UASF. If they are not, the whole thing is a non-event. It's the premise of UASF, after all.
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:07:07
5 cent tx was a long time ago, when the price of a bitcoin was a fraction of what it is today. Nevertheless, I see your point. 
Maybe someone should make an analysis of the backlog and figure out what the fees would be like with double the capacity. Maybe it would still be non-negligible fees.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:35:20


You know what secures a blockchain? Value. You can have all the mining power in the world, if they mine a useless shitcoin, it's not secure (nor usable to you).
You realize that a mere months ago, the mining hash rate was 50% lower, and a few months before that, another 50%?
The number relevant to you is the absolute number of hashes on the chain you follow. For Bitcoin, that number was vastly smaller than it is today just a while ago. It was enough to sustain the network's security then and it's enough now.
So BU's hashrate now is totally sufficient to secure the network if they forked, provided that the coin retains most of its value. They are not forking because it would lose almost all of its value. That won't change even if they have 75%, unless users are swayed.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:25:12
Why the urgency? Why not BIP149 for a safer deployment?
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:01:19
I don't need permission to be a miner, but I also don't need permission to vote with my economic weight which chain I support.
Mining is not a feasible way to gauge community support. It's not feasible that everyone can mine without a loss. Of course you knew that, not sure why you even bothered to say it.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:33:07


I agree this sucks, but to be fair, there is still a point to BTC. Just not for the use case you imagine. For example, it's still a very good when you don't require many or fast transactions, i.e. using it is digital gold which can't be confiscated.
Again, I am not a fan that some use cases of Bitcoin are dying right now, but the price of Bitcoin tells you that there is a point to it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:05:30
You said you would upgrade to a bip148 node if you could... Next best thing you can do is ask your full node provider.

You were told there were problems, you denied them, Erik corrected you, and now it's his fault? :O Your arguments are no better than those of the big blockers.
This is ignoring the fact that LN is not at a stage yet for Erik to be able to use it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:49:46
We are doing it, at least we're trying. Better than the BU folks, who are whining for years but don't dare to split.

They are bad, though, if they mean not being in control of your coins. When coinbase gets hacked and all our sidechain money disappears, are you still going to say they aren't that bad?
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:06:36


Still probably true. If I look at myself and all the people I know that use Bitcoin... none of us run a full node. I am happy knowing I can fall back to using one if I have reason to be suspicious or receive a huge payment or need absolute privacy.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:21:41
Didn't you say you just gave technical support, not political? No one here is more politically vocal on the topic than you are.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:30:34


Realistically, what is the risk that if the legacy chain will start out with the majority of mining power (which seems likely for now), and after months will be reorged? It would take a massive amount of PoW to reorg a month worth of the chain. I'd say if the reorg doesn't happen within a day, catching up will be too expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:33:03


So? It's not like we have to hardfork for the sake of doing a hardfork. The goal isn't a hardfork or a softfork, but an increased capacity while preserving safety. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:54:51
You linked to it, but that doesn't mean it can be used as a representative poll. As I said, I wouldn't ever use a site where I have to reveal my pubkeys to vote.
And then it's just a vote, it doesn't do anything either until the day comes.


Of course, that is the market. If the UASF is not a bluff and users enforce it, dumping the UASF coins will make you lose money.
One of the two will prevail though as the more useful coin, unless Bitcoin is 100% speculation, in which case it doesn't even matter.
@_date: 2017-05-20 02:41:58
That's correct. You have to ask yourself what advantage you get by running a full node, and if a poor person in a poor country absolutely relies on those to get a benefit out of using Bitcoin, or if they can already benefit greatly by using Bitcoin with SPV clients.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:50:46
I am not disputing that.
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:13:44
The idea with UASF is that miners will have to follow users, or else the blocks they mine are worthless (they can't sell the reward or the fees).
If &gt;50% of the miners still fight it (at a great financial loss, mind you), there will indeed be a split. The cost is theoretically too big to sustain this attack.
Of course, UASF only works as advertised if indeed the users enforce it (i.e. wallets, exchanges etc. have to be on board), otherwise, nothing will happen).
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:18:01
Altcoins don't have nearly the traffic/demand that Bitcoin has. When they do, they'll have to make a tradeoff too - security vs. cheap fees (unless by the time those alts get that popular, stuff like LN will have alleviated all of that anyway).
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:31:43
I wonder if 3 months is enough time for the whole ecosystem to upgrade. Also, would you actually use the btc1 implementation? Review and testing standards are subpar, they already did lots of mistakes. Do you trust it to not crash or be exploitable in production, similar to Classic/BU?
@_date: 2017-05-30 09:32:28
But the way you argued, it is the rational choice for everyone to go along with the change, unless they want to risk having their whole chain invalidated months into the future (even if it's a small risk).
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:25:43


But we won't. As I said, MAST/Schnorr and LN is not far away if segwit is in, and each of those is amazing.
Don't forget that our goal is not to increase the blocksize limit for the sake of increasing the blocksize limit. Our goal is to increase capacity.


It will also die if you lose censorship resistance, the **only** thing that sets Bitcoin apart. If the tech community deems that growing the blocks too quickly would jeopardize this property, than this should be the end of the story. 
I also want low fees and P2P cash, but in the end, literally the only thing what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin is censorship resistance, and it should be preserved.
@_date: 2017-05-07 13:30:45
"Everyone can be an ISP". Maybe true, but maybe only a few can afford to have a lot of coins online to enable the bandwidth needed to support high value (or many parallel) transactions.
Disclaimer: I am not very familiar with LN and talking mostly out of my ass. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:10:44
I'll be happy if BIP148 succeeds with enough miner support, but I am doubtful it will.


Not sure how you can say certainty. I would bet good money that a significant portion, if not almost everyone, would prefer to keep going as it is today rather than do something as drastic as a PoW hardfork with little lead time. I am afraid your hope might be overcoming your better judgment.
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:33:33
Just for the record, are altcoin threads officially allowed again? Saw a lot of LTC posts too.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:27:52


Uh yes, that is only logical if you have two independent chains. That doesn't have anything to do with replay protection.


A split is technically possible, but extremely unlikely because the smaller chain is losing a lot of money by not joining the bigger chain.
Note that the UASF is only a UASF if the users (economic majority) enforces it. If that happens, the 70% of miners not going with it are just throwing away their business and their money, so it's just not gonna happen.
If the users don't enforce the UASF, the whole thing is a non-event.
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:57:08
You think just because you haven't experienced it, no one has? Get real.
Been using Bitcoin since longer than you, and I legitimately had tx stuck for a day even with highest fee settings in MyCelium and Electrum.

Isn't it unfair that in this case, even a minority can push through a contentious change, as the other side always has the risk of being wiped out?
Not saying this is the case for the current bip148, but it sounds like a bad precedent which could be repeated by malicious actors.
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:55:53
Or the current network continues without a hardfork, and miners won't commit suicide by forking.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:50:58
Either they are losing fees of other transactions they displace, or there is more supply than demand in blockspace, so occupying it is free anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:16:40


Incorrect. The hashes of public keys are visible, that's it. Also, your votes are locked for the duration of the vote, which is another major roadblock (otherwise, you could move the coins to a new address and re-vote).
In any case, as I said, it's unrealistic to expect that you can get everyone to vote. The only real vote is where you put your money when the flag date comes in BIP148 or BIP149.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:30:57
If you think about it, you can trivially have one node serving many clients as the entry point to the network, and routing calculations are done on that node. Your node would only have this peer, and routing becomes trivial.
50'000 of such nodes would be like 10x more than there are Bitcoin nodes, so perfectly sufficient for the time being. Also note that the growth to this will take a while, and upgrading to much more efficient routing algorithms is perfectly doable in that time.
The other thing is that LN nodes need Bitcoin full nodes to monitor for cheating parties, but afaik, this can also be outsourced with no trust.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:42:51
Nothing is off limits. This is the free market.

@_date: 2017-05-05 08:17:34
To be fair, you don't know what you don't see.
If you are alluding to Gavin's blog posts, note that he mentioned that instead of catching fire and die, the more likely outcome is that people will stop using it. That might very well be the case; you can't see how many people are not using Bitcoin because of the issues.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:44:54
Small minded thinking.
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:24:09


The Bitcoin price moves up and down by more than 20% on a monthly basis. I doubt 20% less fees has a significant impact seeing that the price of Bitcoin was half what it is today only a short while ago.
ASICBoost sounds like a much more plausible reason to block segwit.

Then you lose the security the HW wallet provides?
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:26:52

I agree I'd be best if everyone ran a node, but practically speaking, Erik is right and it's just not realistic that your mum is gonna run her own node.
What's relevant is fighting miner centralization, not enabling every person to run a node (a vast majority are not even technically able to do that anyway, regardless of bandwidth requirements etc).
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:03:05
Why not both? If you happened to be actively trading and lose some coins because of it, even if you knew the risks, the rational thing to do is to try to get them back if the effort is reasonable.

1. About needing a lot of funds in the tumbler: could dedicated offline hardware devices assist in making it more secure?

I don't mind them doing their thing. The whole thing is pretty weird though. Just when Segwit2x was agreed upon (also by Bitmain and Ver), they start another fork?
I'd bet good money on that if BCC fails to overcome BTC in value, they'll come back with another attempt, or continue bitching about BTC.

It's not about the wallet, it's about your computer being connected to the internet and having malware on it.

"Decentralization". Point out the weak point of this setup.
I concede it's not ideal, but I also said until this becomes a problem, much better routing algos can be deployed.
Note that today, there are maybe 10k bitcoin nodes. How decentralized is that? The coins of all the MyCelium and Electrum users are still safe, and if they ever get censored, they can use a different server or run their own. Same with LN.
Note that as opposed to MyCelium and Electrum, your LN transactions would still be private (onion routing), while with the BTC light clients, the servers can see pretty much everything. So censorship in LN can only be all or nothing (and then oyu just move to a different one), not selectively by recipient.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:12:20

A complete win regarding that is has zero risk or negative impact. I am baffled people are so vigorously blocking it.
Note that Core devs are also not ruling out future HF blocksize increases when they are safe and other low hanging fruit has been picked.


A 2mb HF also, by the way. Don't tell me you like BU? Because emergent consensus has seriously not had any testing whatsoever, so it's completely non-deployable at the moment.

If most people have &lt;=10 coins on their node, you can do only transactions &lt;=10 coins at a time, right? Or two transactions &lt;=5 coins at the same time.
I could be wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:47:20
Too much turbulence. Security of the new chain much worse. Nothing close to certainty that everyone will hardfork to this new chain, especially not with not plenty of lead time to gather support.
Bitcoin works well enough how it is today, I won't risk everything just to get segwit. I'd rather wait another year for another try at a UASF segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:37:03
There is no spam. If there is more space supply than demand, it's free and no one should care. If there is less supply than demand, there is a fee, and If the transaction pays, it stays. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:08:31
Because average fee is only one of three factors determining mining revenue, the others being the bitcoin price, and the number of transactions. Those other two would both grow and more than make up for it.

First of all, we don't know yet if the police seized the funds or if the btce admins control it.
Secondly, in either case, there is a chance they will install some sort process for users to withdraw their funds (or parts of it).
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:57:10
If you have two ways of achieving the same thing, and one is inarguably less risky than the other, why would you choose the riskier way?
A hard fork has a significant chance of disruption, while a softfork has 0% chance of disruption. Technically, the path is clear. A hard fork at this point is solely a political move (or a move to keep AsicBoost working for Bitmain).

So you are saying that the users have the power by putting their economic weight behind/against a particular chain? 
That is UASF. It is really literally the same thing, with the mining reward it's just more obvious than with something less tangible like not having segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:32:42


Erik has done his part by writing a lot of blog posts and repeated attempts to make a bridge between the two camps. What more do you expect of him? To be a magician that can solve the scaling debate unilaterally?


Try doing a LN tx on litecoin yourself today. I'd be very surprised if you managed to pull it off. 
I didn't say there was no code, just that it's nowhere near ready to be used productively.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:03:31
I see your point, but I humbly disagree. The victim blaming during the previous exchange hacks made me aware of the issue and ever since, I don't keep any money on exchanges unless I have to, and then only for the shortest time required.
I even lost a few coins on btc-e since I was unlucky to send them right before they shut down. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:25:06
We can go back and forth, but I'm part of the community and for me it's not waiting long enough, and I feel I am by far not the only one who thinks that.
If there is a disruption come Aug. 1st, it's to be blamed on the impatience of BIP148 supporters.
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:23:01


This hashrate will only come if the users enforce the rules. I am specifically talking about the case where there is not enough user support to make that happen.

Miners can do whatever they want, but the rest of the economy can also do whatever they want, and they want segwit. If one company's profits depend on segwit not activating, then too bad for them.
Regardless of that, your statement is wrong. If one company found a way to be 10000% more efficient in mining, you'd be okay with that? It's our job to make sure mining stays decentralized.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:59:35
Because they want to capitalize on Bitcoin's network effect.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:00:06
Fair enough. Even though no matter how big the blocks are, transactions can never be as cheap as with LN?
The opposite is also true, please don't block LN because you want bigger blocks.
Obligatory note though: segwit is an honest-to-god bigger blocks patch, despite all the FUD that claims otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:29:37
Instead of going back, this would be used as a precedent to repeat it every time blocks get full. 2 or 4mb might not be that bad, but at some point it will become bad.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:53:23
There will be no chain split from the perspective of the users, provided the users enforce UASF, which is the premise (if they don't, nothing happens).
It's like if I fork Bitcoin and mine with some other rules right now. Technically it's a chain split, but no one cares if they are not on it.


The point of UASF is that the miners opinion matters 0%. Either they do their job and mine for the users, or they go out of business and give other miners the chance to do it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:17:49
~~This is false. The discount is independent of enabling bigger blocks.~~
I went over the bip141 text again, and I came to the conclusion that I am not sure about my statement anymore. As cool as segwit is, it's not trivial to understand, unfortunately. Sorry for the noise.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:12:32
All your arguments have been brought up when talking in favor of hardforks, but they were all shut down as being too risky. Interesting.
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:12:57
You pretend like there is only this option. Another option would be to define the flag day further in the future so there is more time to gather support.

What's special about August 1st?


Because they think they are continuing what Bitcoin is supposed to be.


Of course, it's a Bitcoin hardfork. That's the point.


Yes, that happens when people disagree about what Bitcoin is.
You'd do all of the same if the tables were turned and you felt cheated of what Bitcoin was and where it was headed.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:27:58
The correct answer to your concern is to not do BIP148 but wait for BIP149, not to go through with BIP148 at all costs with high risk of failure.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:51:53
The problem is that trying to define spam is the ultimate slippery slope and continually trying to do it leads to censorship, the anti-thesis of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:33:18
I can also run my own node and call it a hardfork, but it wouldn't be relevant. It is questionable how many users will really enforce BIP148 when the day comes and there is no broad support. I think it's unlikely a majority of users (resp. economic nodes) will actually have upgraded to a non-Core client by that time. 
Take me: a long time bitcoiner who wants segwit very much, but I consider the flag day of BIP148 to be too close, and I don't see evidence that there is broad support so I can feel confident going along with it, so I won't be enforcing it.
What's even more tragic is that I feel compelled to just not do any transactions on the flag day and the following days until the dust settles. In that sense, the BIP148 movement is doing more harm than good: it makes me unable to use my coins. How much is a chain worth if you have downtimes like these?
@_date: 2017-07-08 21:56:31
Or there is disruption because there is non trivial but insufficient support for BIP148 (no consensus).


Invalid to you, but not to me. Don't speak like it is a fact that there is consensus or 100% support from the economy for BIP148 and only miners are holding it back. There simply is no overwhelming majority (or even a simple majority) of economic users that support it (even when there is such support for segwit in general). If there was more time (bip149), I could see us getting there though.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:46:03

Why? The hardware could have the logic baked in. Just like a Trezor doesn't just sign whatever you send it, it signs transactions it understands.
@_date: 2017-05-11 05:25:12
I don't know a lot about ext blocks, but I'd be fine with them and 6mb. I'd need to look up the criticism of ext blocks and see if they have any merit.
In any case, is it better to wait for 6mb for a year until it is developed and tested, or deploy what is already developed and tested and continue with the other efforts in parallel?
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:25:42


But we won't. As I said, MAST/Schnorr and LN is not far away if segwit is in, and each of those is amazing.
Don't forget that our goal is not to increase the blocksize limit for the sake of increasing the blocksize limit. Our goal is to increase capacity.


It will also die if you lose censorship resistance, the **only** thing that sets Bitcoin apart. If the tech community deems that growing the blocks too quickly would jeopardize this property, than this should be the end of the story. 
I also want low fees and P2P cash, but in the end, literally the only thing what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin is censorship resistance, and it should be preserved.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:14:52
I believe you can outsource the node operation trustlessly, but I could be wrong. I consider this a requirement, otherwise, LN would never take off (the same way as almost no one runs their own Bitcoin node).
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:24:34
That is untrue. If you and a hundred other stubborn people try to go through with it even if the rest backs out due to too little support, there is no disruption. You just exclude yourself from the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:11:09
Preserving censorship resistance is more important you frigging dolt.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:49:03
Don't get me wrong, I am in favor of bigger blocks, and have been for years. Just in recent times though I came to realize that censorship resistance is literally the only thing that sets Bitcoin apart, and we should be very careful in not breaking that.
In any case, Satoshi wasn't a prophet, nor a very good coder. Afaik he had fraud proofs in mind, which would indeed be a viable way to centralize nodes and still allows clients to enforce the rules (though it would kill censorship resistance!); but fraud proofs don't exist yet.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:50:40
There is good value in it being a hedge against some failures of Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin failed to activate segwit so far, and Litecoin is helping building the pressure to make it happen.
That is value beyond pump and dump.

This is not what people usually consider scammy. Also, there is a good reason now to adopt Litecoin, so it's not scammy, even by your definition.


The potential new BIP148 altcoin doesn't bring anything new as compared to Litecoin, so this new altcoin is a scamcoin.
Could the reason that you are not promoting Litecoin instead of BIP148 be just that you are invested in Bitcoin but not in Litecoin?

Are you gonna code it and make sure there is no trouble with any edge case, i.e. segwit on bip4 activating in parallel before it times out in September, and a second set of P2P network messages, etc.?

Either both or none is fair, and Core defaults to not giving users the option to shoot themselves in the foot.

@_date: 2017-06-14 12:49:33
You might overestimate it, too. There are a lot of examples of competitors overtaking the first mover.
You did see that all other coins skyrocketed in the past few months, much more so than Bitcoin, right? Not saying it's because of this, but it still could be.
I talk to a lot of people, and almost everyone confirmed they started to hedge by buying into alts, including early adopters who say that Bitcoin is now digital gold and  It's happening, one can just debate how much it is happening and how far it can go. It's reasonable to assume that if Bitcoin stagnates, others will take over.

The average tx amount is not a good measure for two reasons:
- average is bad in general (median is better). There are many gigantic value transactions (i.e. exchanges moving their cold wallet, loading hot wallet, etc.).
- of course the avg. amount is high because small amounts are currently not economical.


There will be more tx for setting up payments, but it is hard to estimate how many tx can be saved by those. What's sure is that use cases not possible today will be enabled, so Bitcoin can serve more people and more use cases.
Everyone wants to go from 0 to billions of users overnight. Even being able to serve 10x more than we have today is an epic advancement. And that this is not the end of the road.

The people that are willing to pay it will, but a lot of people won't be and will move to an altcoin. Most likely, a lot of people deem &gt;$1 tx fees too high and moved along. Can't blame them after seeing fees rise &gt;20-fold.
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:23:32
Could, but the chance can be arbitrarily small, if for example a small minority of miners only switches to bip148.
It could also take weeks or months, and in the meantime you have two coins. A reorg wiping out a a legacy chain after a non trivial amount of time will result in losses. Do you want Bitcoin to be known for being the coin where you can lose money due to badly organized soft fork deployments?
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:04:07
That there is a big chance that the majority of miners will keep mining the current chain and we get two coins, just like in a HF.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:49:14


No need to exaggerate though.
While I am looking forward to seeing LN in action, let's not pretend it's a silver bullet. It needs a lot of development still, and it's not clear yet if it will really see widespread use (before, usability issues like needing to be online need to be addressed). 
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:53:13
If the users make good on their threat (unlikely), most of them. If not, probably none.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:22:14
Untrue. Bigger blocks are only one of like 10 benefits of segwit. Litecoin benefits from all others just the same as Bitcoin would.

I'll just repeat myself I guess.


@_date: 2017-06-14 09:34:18
That assumes the backlog of higher paying transactions clears at some point before your tx is dropped. I am not sure if a $0.10 fee will ever get you confirmed, for example.

Hey, I'll make a BTC fork. If you don't follow, there will be split!!! I'll be the only one using it, but who cares if I can use it as an argument to convince others to follow me.

@_date: 2017-06-04 13:12:57
We can do that more safely. It's only impatience that is creating this mess.
As things stand, people won't be able to use (are recommended not to use) Bitcoin for a few days after Aug. 1st. This alone should be a huge red flag to everyone.

They are discussed, and have been, extensively. 
Despite the FUD, there are not many people (even among Core devs) that are against blocksize increases (which segwit also is, for a start). We just want it to be a slow ramp up and not hasty/reckless, to preserve the **only** thing that sets Bitcoin apart from every other payment system: censorship resistance. If we gamble away this, Bitcoin will degrade to a more modern PayPal. I don't know if you know, but bandwidth is not the only concern, there are many complex issues that interact. So going slow, measuring the real world impact and going from there is absolutely reasonable.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:19:32

Be real, there was no one advocating harder for BIP148. He claimed it was a certainty and had widespread consensus, even though it most obviously didn't have (not even most Core contributors were on board, let alone any exchange or big company, and not a lot of users either).
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:38:21
True, I only assume segwit is not controversial by different metrics, i.e.  blog posts by companies, talking to users and devs at various meetups, and so on. I have yet to find someone in real life who doesn't want it, this includes adamant big blockers (which I count myself as).
Zooming out a bit, it is surprising that something like segwit was invented that appeases to people who want bigger blocks *and* to people who are scared of hard forks, and also bundles a shitload of other benefits, but it still isn't deployed. Weird world.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:14:16
Because the exchange rate is not fixed.
0.01 btc is not a small payment today, but it was some years ago. In the future, 0.001 btc could be a big payment.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:00:41
I don't know what you mean, of course miners are businesses. For example, there is a good case to be made that one of the miners is blocking SegWit because of business reasons (it would kill an immense profit).
In any case, even if you ignore miners: Bitcoin doesn't exist meaningfully outside of the context it's used in. 


Not sure how you can say that? Of course it is. If Bitcoin is too expensive for businesses to use, they will try to change Bitcoin so it's not, or use something else. Both outcomes trivially affect Bitcoin. Are you gonna say it's not Bitcoin's problem if Litecoin and Ethereum's market cap is 10x the size of Bitcoin's? What if hashrate drops to 1% of what it is today because it's not profitable anymore? Certainly, that would be a problem, right? 
For example, Yours and [Paralelni Polis]( are switching to Litecoin because fees are too high.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:29:29
It's pretty crazy though. All the time we have been fighting hard fork proposals because of the risks, and now we do this, which has very similar risks?
People (including the blog post linked by this thread!) are advocating not using Bitcoin for a while starting Aug. 1st. Is this real life? A coin which you can't use because a minority is trying to push an unsafe way of deploying segwit is not a very useful coin.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:31:14
If you want BIP148, you can use the signed binaries. If not, stick to Core. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:10:07
So the argument is that if a minority of users want to push a change in a way the majority disagrees with, everyone should still follow suit because they have a risk (albeit a small one) of getting their chain wiped out?
Does that not sound bad to you? It sounds bad to me.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:11:00
I don't think many people oppose experimenting with LN and seeing if they can alleviate a lot of the pressure.
But even if segwit was active today, it's a long way out until we'd see LN in action and really taking off the pressure.
And I'm saying this years after bigger blocks were first proposed. We could have avoided all the drama easily a long time ago :/
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:42:21
True, but that isn't the premise of the meme, which is that you held your coins and got rich.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:10:34
This is a good reason. There were good reasons to allow Classic threads back in the day too. Btw., BIP148 doesn't have overwhelming consensus, even if Segwit does.
@_date: 2017-06-04 12:21:26
Would you say the same for a $10 transaction? What about $50?
This is where we are headed if nothing else changes.
Edit: btw., I posted she same response a year or two ago to similar comments like OP's, but $10 and $50 replaced with $1 and $5. Many saw the sharp fee rise coming, but I'm still surprised it was that quick and that big an increase.

LN tx literally are Bitcoin transactions, just with delayed broadcast.

What if the HF was locked in a certain period of time after segwit activates?
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:23:20


This is patently false. It can of course be assumed that the original Bitcoin will survive, and it's in fact the most likely outcome. BIP148 is controversial, and JihanCoin is a joke, no one will be using that.

Bitcoin literally only works because of business reasons. Concretely, paying the miners, who are not doing it out of charity.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:32:10
Don't know what you mean. Are you saying Bitcoin means something apart from people using it? That is obviously false. Of course users decide what Bitcoin is, and users constitute the market. Businesses obviously affect what Bitcoin is and will become.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:02:54
To be fair, it should be seen through the lens of business costs. Every trade is business.
It could be that the decentralization level vs. scalability tradeoff today is a bit off and we are losing out on a lot of adoption as a result.

There are safer ways to take back the power and fight.

I think nullc meant that everyone who chooses not to be on the 148 side (or isn't even aware of it) could have all their transactions wiped out by a reorg.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:40:54
There will always be someone disagreeing, but that shouldn't be a good reason to block everyone else. In this case, it's literally only a handful of people who profit immensely from blocking it, even more than any increase in price and user adoption would give them.

If the hardware has the logic encoded in what it's doing, it can't be taken advantage of: it can only do the right thing.
Manual intervention could only be needed in exceptional cases like draining all (or some of) the funds.

He can still wait, for now. Not much longer and fees will be $10 every day of the week.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:13:37
Then you got no one but yourself to blame when the price crashes due to market uncertainty, if this movement really manages to make that kind of fuss.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:42:08
What about a $70 dollar fee? This is where we are headed if nothing changes.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:38:32
That other layer is still not feasible without segwit, or so I heard. In that sense, it's still vaporware, and saying it is the solution does not help the fact that people can't use it today and probably not for another two years.
In that time, everyone will move on to Litecoin or whatever other chain. I am not sure if Bitcoin as digital gold can retain its value if all its other use cases die and people move on.
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:24:02
I don't think there is a better way than to just set a flag date (enough time for people who want to to upgrade, so not Aug. 1st), run with it and see where the money goes.
That is how it's been done traditionally, i.e. with P2SH and more.
Miner support for sure also isn't a good way of measuring, as it only measures miner support, not community support (ideally the same, but not always).
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:56:44
By some definition of controversial you are right. To me, if everyone except one (or multiple) big miner is in favor, it's not controversial.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:01:26
I think most would argue that a HF is successful when there is no split, but virtually all users upgraded to the new chain.
Did you consider that 2 months is not nearly enough time to gather the support you want? Many users won't even know this shit is going on.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:05:52
The only problem is that it's not as widely used, but gotta start somewhere I guess.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:31:41


This is just a favor to miners to coordinate / give them time to upgrade. Anything over 50% is enough to force it through if needed, by orphaning non-cooperating miners' blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:58:09
What about not advocating 148 to prevent a chain split?
In the future, the same arguments you use now could be used to push in a malicious change.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:17:01
So the Core client will be filled with dozens of flags which people can use to break consensus? Don't forget that every one adds a significant burden to the project in maintenance.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:44:51
Unfortunately, it is not unlikely that this is going nowhere.
AsicBoost is too profitable. 
This compromise takes steam away from bip148-uasf, so after Aug. 1st Bitmain will pull out.
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:12:27
Not sure if you don't know, but you still need miners. The idea is that the users fire miners who don't support. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:58:09
We are at the start of an area that could grow incredibly diverse and rich. For now, we have the luxury that we can still track most of the developments and understand them if we put in enough effort, but at some point it's not gonna be feasible anymore unless you specialize in this.
Much like today, very few people know the details of tcp/ip, packet routing, and so on.
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:44:00
Bip148 is not supported by 80-90% of the ecosystem by a long shot, even if segwit is.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:47:14
You should rather wonder what the price would be if people didn't leave.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:09:05
The most compelling argument that to me is that many years ago, the limit was set at 1mb, which was fairly arbitrary, but apparently deemed low enough to not be an issue if filled. If adoption would have been faster, we might have filled those blocks in 2014 instead of 2017, for example.
In the meantime though, bandwidth, storage and processing power has dramatically increased. If 1mb was good enough back then, 2mb or 4mb sure as hell is good enough today.
We still don't have that, because people are afraid of hardforks (even before segwit was a thing). I also think the risks are vastly overstated, and we could have had bigger blocks and less drama for years already.
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:45:50
Well put. I agree.

To minimize counterparty risk, which exists regardless of if you did anything wrong or not.
