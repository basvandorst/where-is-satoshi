zimbabwean dollars exploded due to inflation and instead of tackling the issue the govt kept printing more notes to spend for all expenses. It was the result of a mismanagement and a corrupt government. Atleast you can hold the govt responsible but whom do u blame if bitcoin falls to $5000 tomorrow? Bitcoin or any decentralized system is not fit for being an unified currency.

You seem knowledgeable. I bought $50 BTC on September 15 when it dipped. I now want to buy $50 more but the price has risen quite a bit. Should I wait until September 30 for the China drama or the dip is over? Thanks!
