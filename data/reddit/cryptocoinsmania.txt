Oh my, they're really panicking. On the other hand, that what they say is even a better encouragement go with bitcoins.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:10:53
You may try [Coinmama]( It's pretty nice. 
Cex.io accept credit cards as well, it's simple to use as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:05
What a lovely day.
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:27:14
But, but I don't want you to be stable...
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:37:32
Should it drop a bit or even below $3,000 after such rocketing?
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:58:26
Use only trusted and legit exchange for that big amount. Something like [Cex.io]( [Kraken]( maybe [Gemini](
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:48:33
Make sure your pc or other device is secure, use 2-Factor Authentication, use SMS or Email notifications also.
Don't keep your funds at the exchange. Transfer them to wallet controlled by you.
And you should be okay.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:46:25
Try using [Localbitcoins]( or companies such as [Cex.io]( or [Coinbase]( However, be extremely careful when making transactions involving bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:04:08
[LakeBTC]( states that accepts paypal, but never tried that so cannot confirm 100%. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:38:03
Transaction fees are going the same way..
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:30:25
It's like I felt few months before.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:56:24
Mostly [Cex.io]( and [LakeBTC]( For trading between cryptos - [Whaleclub]( 
Fees are okay for me as services are great. However, sometimes it takes a bit too long.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:29:23
Try using [Coinmama]( if can pay with credit card or [LakeBTC]( via bank transfer. They accept WU and MoneyGram also.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:48:44
[Cex.io]( [LakeBtc]( [Localbitcoins]( [Exmo]( [LiteBit]( for Europeans, [CoinSpot]( for Australians. It more depends on the country and payment method preferred. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:08:17
Yes, just sharing with another one. Maybe it's going to save someones coins.
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:52:38
Few months later..
"Man I should have bought at 3,300".
This will never get old, I guess.
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:00:55
I am not sure what do you mean. Maybe you need [Bitmex]( For traditional trading - [Binance](
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:02:42
Try [Cex.io]( or [LakeBTC]( for such amount. Or [Coinmama]( if buying with card. And don't keep your bitcoins after buying at exchange. Transfer them to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:58:42
He definitely is good bitcoins investor.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:48:34
Well, chose other [bitcoin exchange]( then. Coinbase was always a bit slow. Sure it depends on your country of residence and preferred payment method, but you should find something what fits you best.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:00:14
Gonna be good time buying more bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:49:21
Old but gold meme.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:47:21
Just wait.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:37:00
But don't check the price every 5 minutes. You'll go crazy or make something stupid. Just HODL and enjoy that you're into Bitcoin already.
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:47:26
It sounds more exciting.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:40:19
Well you should be more careful now, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:48:37
I feel sorry for you...
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:46:00
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:23:37
I am not sure about HSBC but some banks doesn't like bitcoin and activity related to that. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:28:52
Too long, especially when we have to say that so often.
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:54:38
Well, this is not the best place to buy bitcoin anymore. There are more better options IMO. Check [cryptocoinsmania.com]( to find some popular exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-23 05:53:53
Tons of places. Maybe check [Localbitcoins, Coinbase]( or something like that. And a lot of exchanges will not ask you for an ID if you buy $20.
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:17:53
Tons of places.
Depending on your country, preferred payment method, amount, etc.
Check [Cex, Coinbase, Localbitcoins, Gemini (US), Coinmama (purchasing with a bank card), etc.](
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:02:37
Is it FUD or for real?
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:17:31
Well, it's okay because of there is no restrictions. 
However, stay away out of scam sites, use only trusted [bitcoin gambling sites](
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:34:40
Buy and hold. What we could say more...
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:32:27
There are some Bitcoin gambling sites. Depending on what payment method do you prefer or what games you're looking for. Also, some gambling sites do not accept customers from the US. You can check them here, by the country and desired cryptocurrency - 
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:45:29
The time is now!
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:28:56
No it's not really hard to find trusted place to acquire Bitcoin. For newcomers [Cex, Coinmama, LakeBTC or Exmo]( is okay. 
You'll never get the 1:1 fiat currency to bitcoin exchange. Everyone takes their part. There is no free things.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:43:11
Well, many here are facing issues with Coinbase. I would try another exchange platform such as [Cex.io]( then.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:23:41
It was down already. Now I see only a rising up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:38:50
I think China played well here. Too many people panicked and slipped on this bait.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:46:32
Maybe [Cex.io]( would work. 
More international are [LakeBTC]( [Changelly]( [Coinmama]( [Exmo](
There is [Localbitcoins]( always as well.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:35:47
Yes, Bitquick is trusted and reliable exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:01:00
if you still didn't find it, you may try your luck checking sites listed here: 
Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:37:00
Don't buy an used one. It might have harmful soft installed. It's better to add some bucks and get from official retailer or manufacturer itself. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 10:27:26
Check [Cex.io]( It's pretty similar to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:42:43
On your age there is only Localbitcoins. Other exchanges may require to verify your identity by providing ID, so you won't go through. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:35:59
Check [Cex.io]( or [Coinmama]( for deposits with debit card.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:53:43
I'm waiting to catch the lowest point as well. Just guessing how much btc may drop more.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:40:18
If looking for based in Australia then [CoinSpot]( or Coinjar. But you may try [Cex.io]( or [LakeBTC]( as well. However, fees will be not very small at any exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:08:22
It's pretty safe. Just be careful anyways. Do not transfer bitcoin first, or don't give the cash unless you see that the guy made a transaction to your bitcoin address. 
Using the site itself is easy enough. Just register and use it for a while, make some browsing inside it, read FAQ and some other info provided there.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:27:39
You can't because of KYC/KML regulations. 
There is a chance to buy something around $50 without verification at [Coinmama]( or [Changelly]( maybe, but that's it.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:45:59
Well, it isn't a bad move, but there are many other exchanges with a bit lower fees, or faster turnaround time. Depends on how much trading you do as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:58:19
UK citizens should be okay with [Cex.io]( GBP is supported, payments with Credit card and bank transfer are available too.
In some cases [LiteBit]( is worth trying also.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:41:00
Yes, Gemini is great. Don't worry.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:46:39
Firstly, start [researching and reading]( When you know how it works, only then go further. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:55:16
Well, Bitcoin isn't very safe investment in this case, because money can be lost. It's better to use money which may be lost without any further affect for financial situation.
However, I'm not the life teacher or financial advisor so it's up to you. ROI is really attractive and profits can be made.
As you're UK resident try [Cex.io]( [LiteBit]( [Localbitcoins](  [BitPanda](  
Fees are very different, as payment methods too.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:55:04
Well Paypal acceptance for bitcoin is really poor. Why? Because paypal may be charged back. You can try [LakeBTC]( which accepts Paypal as payment method, but for further orders find other option.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:09:03
Kraken, Cex, Gemini.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:34:02
[LakeBTC]( [Cex.io]( [Changelly]( may work for you as newcomer. However, as BakersDozen advised - don't keep your funds at the exchanger. Transfer them to wallet controlled by you ASAP.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:37:00
Don't buy an used one. It might have harmful soft installed. It's better to add some bucks and get from official retailer or manufacturer itself. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:41:29
You might try Coinmama for buying with a credit/debit card. 
[Coinmama Review](
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:27:16
Welcome to Coinbase! 
I would rather change it to [Cex]( [Kraken]( [LakeBTC](
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:34:32
It's hard. Most of the exchanges must meet KYC/AML regulations, especially for credit/debit card transactions. 
You may check [LakeBTC]( as they have many interesting deposit methods, maybe you would find a way how to make a deposit without providing an ID.
@_date: 2017-09-03 08:23:19
Try [CoinSpot]( It supports many cryptocurrencies, and has pretty low fees.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:41:29
You might try Coinmama for buying with a credit/debit card. 
[Coinmama Review](
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:00:26
No. Payments are accepted in EUR, GBP, USD, RUB...
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:42:55
Well, it's mostly personal opinion. Exchange can be evaluated by fees, limits, verification process, history, reputation, etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:32:39
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:35:47
Yes, Bitquick is trusted and reliable exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:56:30
Go to GreenAddress.it or download Exodus to your pc. 
There is blockchain.info also, but it sometimes gets annoying with bugs and instability.
@_date: 2017-09-10 06:44:38
It depends on your country. You may try [Cex.io]( [LiteBit]( [Localbitcoins]( It's hard to say.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:40:31
[Cex.io]( [Coinmama]( [Changelly](
Coinmama has biggest limits I guess.
@_date: 2017-09-07 14:49:02
Depends on your country.
[Cex.io]( [Localbitcoins]( 
USA (besides international exchanges):
[BitQuick]( [Gemini]( [LakeBTC](
[LiteBit]( [BitPanda](
Asia and Europe:
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:37:34
So many [Bitcoin Exchanges]( are available. You only need to chose payment method and the one which works in your country.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:49:10
Yes, [Coinbase]( is trusted and secure. However there are some few other options: [Cex.io]( [LakeBTC]( [Coinmama]( [Kraken](
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:35:22
[Cex.io]( for UK residents is more than okay. Or [Localbitcoins]( 
You can exchange/trade bitcoin to any crypto you want at trading sites.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:44:44
[LakeBTC]( accepts paypal.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:34:57
Yes, of course there are. And I would say a lot of them. It isn't something new in this niche. Depending on your country or games you want to play it may vary. Check [Topbitcoingambling.com]( it allows you to filter gambling sites by accepted countries, games, etc.
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:14:25
Try filter out exchanges by your payment method and exact location here: r/ You should find some exchanges.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:37:43
That depends on your needs and preferences. Try checking [ where you can filter exchanges by the payment method and your country. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:04:40
Maybe [Cex.io]( would help in this situation. Just I am not sure how you may resolve the issue with the proof of address. Maybe try sending them pdf statement out of your US bank account (online). 
Oh and almost forgot [BitBay]( - it's a Polish based exchange. They've some limits without verification. That would not be a whole sum, but could help a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:25:07
And one more redditor fcked up with coinbase. Go to [Cex]( Kraken, gemini or other [exchange](
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:32:38
Check [Cex.io]( As I know it works for Mexicans. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:41:13
You won't find exchange with no fees. There are many of them, just it depends on your country.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:27:15
Maybe yes, maybe not. Who knows? Probably no one.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:38:50
I think China played well here. Too many people panicked and slipped on this bait.
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:54:12
Lambo here I come!
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:53:53
There are some besides Gdax and Coinbase. I like [Cex]( It's simple to use and pretty fast. Verification process isn't complicated and usually takes no longer than few hours (from my personal experience).
@_date: 2018-04-26 10:56:30
Did he open binance account yet?
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:46:35
Yeah, Bitcoin is making its way. We've a bright future.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:09:06
I doubt that BTC-e is going back ever. Well, at least while investigation is in the process.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:30:49
Why everyone is so scared? It is not the first time when that happens. It's normal variation. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:56:42
It's up to you. But many here offered to stay away from buying till August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:33:38
No update for 7 hours. Is everything okay?
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:25:05
Oh, okay my mistake here. However, last update on twitter 20 hours ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:05:04
Offline more than one day.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:01:34
All bitcoins would be bought and HODL? Then price wouldn't rise. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:54:23
Well yeah, must agree with you.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:59:44
And how hodlers look like during bear market? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:58:19
Most important new in /bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:53:01
Most fascinating is that that was not so long ago.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:36:08
It is down for few days already. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:48:50
I't's not the first bubble. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:04:16
Is someone here who bought at few dollars?
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:27:57
This GIF is what I see mostly now.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:56:02
I guess it can go lower than 1500.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:14:25
Sounds too good to be true. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:35:25
It's just the title. Everyone who owns Bitcoin is considered a criminal by some institutions.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:19:57
No. Most of the time the exchange will ask to confirm/verify your card.
