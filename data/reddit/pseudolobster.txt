Yes. It's that stupid.
There is a way of doing this right, in a cryptographically secure way. As I understand it, [this vanity address generator]( does it correctly, where both you and the site each provide a seed, a miner derives a solution where the answer is a private key for that vanity address, but neither the site nor the miner can get the actual private key.
As far as I can tell though, this is exactly as stupid as it looks. Apparently it relied on uninformed people who don't understand how bitcoin works.

It's public. If you have a webserver that serves HTML, people can get a copy of that HTML by querying your webserver. 
There's no terms and conditions to that, it's public-facing. It's like someone looking at your house. You can't force people to give you five cents for looking at your house. If it's in public, people have the right to look at it without paying you.
Now, if you put your house in a big tent and charged admission to enter the tent, that's different, it's private, and it's illegal for someone to peek under the tent without your permission.

When I worked at a large telecom company that starts with A and ends in &amp;T, who shall remain nameless, I was surprised to find out I was allowed to suspend people's accounts without authorization if it was because the phone was lost or stolen. There was in fact an automated system for doing this even. Press 7 to report your phone lost or stolen, and then poof, the line is suspended until the owner calls in and removes the suspension.
The other thing that was interesting is you could pay someone's bill without authorization. We weren't allowed to give any details on the account whatsoever, including the name, phone number, or amount owing, but we could take payments with nothing but an account number.

Reddit has a wiki system. Maybe that'd be a good place for it. You'd have to ask the mods for help in putting it there though.
Edit: I'm really not sure why I'm being downvoted for this suggestion. I think the wiki is a great place for this kind of thing. OP really ought to ask the mods to put this there so it can be formatted better, it can have an index/table of contents, etc. I'm not trying to be a dick, and I'm not trying to say it shouldn't be here or anything like that, I'm just saying the wiki would also be a great place for it.

Just to nitpick your wording, the default subs are hand-chosen by the admins. Their subscriber count is high for default subs, not because that's what chooses what becomes a default, but because being a default you automatically get 2 million subscribers.
The defaults have only been changed like twice ever. Each time it's done, they're chosen by the admins in a meeting at reddit headquarters. It's not like, once you get above a certain amount of subscribers, new users are automatically subscribed.

(out of people who have the alexa plugin installed in their browser)
This might be true, but take Alexa ratings with a grain of salt.
Once upon a time, Alexa was the single biggest analytics site on the internet, and was the best at tracking who's who on the web. They've fallen from grace a long time ago, with their spammy toolbars and crap. Nowadays they're less and less relevant. At best, think of them like Nielsen Ratings for TV. They're valid ratings, though, people doing the ratings probably aren't really representative of everyone.

I don't get what he means by intrinsic value here. Privacy is something that has a specific dollar value? 
I'm pretty sure Aristotle meant something along the lines that coins should be made of gold, so even if they're not used as a currency they still hold the value of the metal itself.
Bitcoin is meaningless numbers. Those numbers hold absolutely no value of any kind other than as a currency. A dollar bill even has some value, that of the paper it's printed on. Probably some ten thousandth of a cent or something. 
In the case of bitcoin though, there's nothing you can do with those numbers themselves, they can't be "used for privacy", they hold no intrinsic value.

~~You're still missing the point. Yes, these are great things for a currency. These are useful things, that are valuable *as a currency*. Privacy is also valuable for it *as a currency*. But the numbers themselves hold no intrinsic value.~~
~~Gold has an intrinsic value. It's highly conductive, does not corrode in air, is very dense and malliable, and it's aesthetically appealing to humans and magpies. These are things about it that have intrinsic value. The gold itself has value. That's what it means to have intrinsic value, other than as a currency. You can use gold as a currency if you like. It has things about it that are good for use as a currency, like it's scarcity etc, *but that's totally not the point at all*.~~
Actually I'm wrong. Well, we're both right, I'm just wrong for saying that you're wrong. 
Apparently intrinsic value for money has two distinct meanings. One for its suitability-as-money, the other meaning being the value of the metal of a coin.

What I'd like to know is how does someone working at walmart manage to save $15k in the first place? That's an entire year's wages. 
Typically people working at walmart live paycheck to paycheck, often not having enough for both rent and food, so they need to be on food stamps just to live. It's practically impossible to save anything, let alone $15k.

If you'd like anecdotes, I for one, do drugs. I smoke pot, but I buy it the old fashioned way, locally. I've had bitcoins for a while, but in my humble opinion, as long as you've got connections, it's easier and cheaper to buy drugs in person.
So far I've used bitcoins to buy amazon.com gift cards, steam gift cards, a sweater, some t-shirts, ram for my computer, and once I mine up another ten bucks worth I need to buy a lithium battery charger. I've also given out a ton of tips and reddit gold here on reddit. No drugs though.

It's actually *because of* the internal wear leveling algorithms you theoretically still need to do multiple passes. Flash memory has extra reserved sectors so when certain cells inevitably wear out it won't lose capacity. 
So, say, for 1mb of storage space there's actually 1.2mb of nand cells, and your data is scattered all over it according to an algorithm. Even if you write a full 1mb of data to it, there could still be 0.2mb of old data that hasn't been overwritten by the new 1mb.

What use do they have other than as a currency?
Other arrangements of zeroes and ones produce things of intrinsic value, like MP3 files or ebooks or movies or video games. Those numbers have a value.
What good is a series of cryptographic hashes OTHER THAN as a currency? If bitcoins suddenly were completely worthless, what would you do with the hashes that's of any value?
If we used gold and silver coins like Aristotle did, if the economy of ancient Greece suddenly collapsed and those coins were worthless as currency, they are still worth something as gold and silver. That's what this is talking about. What would you do with the numbers?

This is completely normal. Any time you perform any transaction over 10k the banks start to ask questions. Of course they're going to fucking ask you.

A lot of people don't want to spend their bitcoin. They bought it as a long term investment against inflation of their county's fiat currency. Like gold. 
Gold has a ridiculously high market cap, people buy it as an investment. If someone arranged a "spend your gold" day, and on that day, gold transactions were 6000% higher than an average day, it would be considered a success. 
Sure, 99.99% of people who own gold still wouldn't spend it, and the transaction volume would be pretty low, certainly nothing compared to WU or Visa etc.
