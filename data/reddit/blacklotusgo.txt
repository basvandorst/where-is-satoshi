This is not true when you consider:
1) Hope the individual cards sell
2) Subtract tcgplayer fees (11% + $.50 per transaction)
3) Subtract shipping and material costs
4) Factor in the time and effort of listing and shipping each card individually
5) You do not get bitcoin
It can be worth it to sell certain cards for those who are willing to spend the time on it, but even then you are generally netting pennies per card and for less expensive cards you will actually be getting much less.

We can buy pokemon cards as well. Please send an email to buyer with some details about your collection and we can provide an offer.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:59:16
You could at least sell 1. :)
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:59:44
Sure there is!


That being said, if you do have a large collection or foils that aren't on the buylist, you can email buyer

Sorry for the late reply - just found this thread! We're gaining more inventory day by day. What type of cards in particular are you looking for?

As a fellow vendor of MTG for BTC, trust me, you will be getting this joke a lot ;)

 sells Magic: the Gathering cards for bitcoin and then distributes the BTC to users who sell us cards through our buylist. In fact, many people have gotten their first BTC in this manner.

BlackLotusGo.com launched in January. Our site was created specifically so that we could accept bitcoin payments for our MTG sales!
We are also the ONLY store in the world to pay out bitcoin for our buylist! Get bitcoin for your Magic cards!

I'm a bit late in noticing this thread, but I am now discussing my experience in using Bitpay for MTG sales with them.
@_date: 2014-01-22 03:57:15
How do you mean? We've been selling cards for USD for years, but we opened this site starting in 2014 specifically so we could use bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:59:34
Find anything nice? :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 06:37:43
I bet we can get you BTC faster than them ;)
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:16:06
That's a nice collection! Feel free to send a PM here or email buyer if you have any general questions we could help with or if you want to sell any of these cards for bitcoin.

It is hopeful that becomes more active in the near future. BlackLotusGo.com is certainly a start in the right direction. There is definitely a lot of overlap between people interested in BTC and in MTG, based on the activity that occurred when bitmit was still operating.

Well, today's probably a better time to start than tomorrow! ;)

Thank you for the information! They look a bit pricey, but perhaps I will use this option if I ever feel the need to convert coins into cards.
EDIT: It is actually excellent news that an authorized Wizards retailer accepts bitcoin. Now the type of casual seller that I am hoping to recruit can simply sell $100 worth of old cards they'd never use and go buy a booster box of the new set with their coins.

BitMit offers a referral program for recruiting new users to the site (15% of their 1.90% cut). I have not included my own referral link in my posts throughout the MTG community, as my goal is truly to create a thriving marketplace and I didn't want to run the risk of not being taken seriously. If, however, you fellow bitcoiners are planning to sell and wish to be friendly, feel free to use my link:

Excellent thread! Thrilled that others are involved in this particular market. As a bitcoin enthusiast and former ebay powerseller (5500+ feedback) who has recently become disillusioned with ebay, this is a perfect fit. There also happens to be a large overlap between the bitcoin and MTG communities. I've been selling and buying MTG on bitmit and am planning to drastically increase my offerings in the coming weeks.
The features that are standard on ebay that are typically useful for MTG are:
1) Search by cardname. Already available on bitmit, but limited practical application with so few listings (compared to ebay and tcgplayer). This is fixed automatically as more cards are listed. (I'm hoping to help on this end!)
2) Sort by price. Highest first allows users to view the "interesting" listings easily. Lowest first is typically useful as an additional filter when searching for an individual card, but is not necessarily relevant to MTG yet because there are not typically multiple listings for the same card. There is also a lot of "garbage" (e.g. overpriced commons/uncommons) listed that nobody wants to look at. (This is a result of free listings). Sort by price within a category or keyword is something that we should ask tosaki to implement on bitcointalk.org. We could even request that MTG get its own subcategory, since it has the potential to be a large market share on bitmit.
3) Search by seller. One tactic that I have used is that whenever I see a seller with MTG listings, I view all of their items to see if they have something that sparks my interest.
Implementation of these 3 features is “enough” in the sense that it makes these listings comparable to ebay.A third party site that can perform gatherer-esque sort functionality would certainly be nice, but might be difficult to completely integrate in terms of awareness. Sellers could potentially help on this end by adding description to listings. My typical format for listing is
[CARDNAME] MTG Magic [EXPANSION NAME] [CONDITION] 
But more could be added if judged useful, such as “standard, modern, legacy, EDH” or “artifact, blue” etc.
There is so much potential in this market when you don’t have to deal with ridiculous site and paypal fees. This is just the beginning. In a perfect world, many users will adopt bitmit for mtg sales and cards will become extremely fluid as users can "trade" with each other using BTC as an intermediary.
