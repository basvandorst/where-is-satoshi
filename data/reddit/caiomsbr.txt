Since they held my BTC i've been in contact with their CPO GUSTAVO GUIDA REIS, he said my account was frozen because it had been flagged as a fraud. And they were working on it.
Well, here's the deal:
1. How can I fraud a platform which only accepts BITCOINS as a deposit method
2. If my account was FROZEN, WHY THERE'S NOTHING STATED IN MY ACCOUNT SAYING SO?
3. My account is frozen, but there can be DEPOSITS OF BITCOINS, BUT CANNOT HAVE WITHDRAWALS, how convenient to them!
A) My account had received 3 listing payments, which was from the same person, which was the owner of the bitcoin community brazil Wladmir Crippa, I can prove I lent to him in the beggining of the year. the ammount I received from this listing sums 0.42 btcs: 
B) I deposited 0.6 bitcoins in order to test the AUTO-INVEST. the deposit went through EVEN THOUGH he reported my account was frozen. here's the tx id: af90f492d24e4d397dfff3c4bac3d2af32efbf3e64d070ade0e3538e0bc12469 and when the bitcoins confirmed I gave up and tried to withdraw the coins back to my wallet, just to find the word: WITHDRAW ERROR then I started asking questions.
C) Support totally seems to ignore me, probably because i'm posting this story EVERYWHERE.
my user ID: 
I DON'T HAVE ANY DEPOSITS WITH CREDIT CARDS OF SOME KIND NEITHER MY REFFERALS. They are all in good standing nor defaulted nor overdue!
THEY ARE REFUSING TO GIVE ME MY COINS!!!

And believe me.. This is happening to all of us! The only ones profiting from this are: BtcJam owners which take their cut no matter what.. and the scammers themselves.

I don't think is a "false" statistic since the numbers speak for themselves:
If the minimum rate is 2.5% and the APR is 18%. something is clearly wrong. Frauds CANNOT OPERATE in such a high volume rate within the platform. And if IT IS that high, There's CLEARLY not a strong effort to fight them. I think it's a bit convenient to the btcjam owners and shareholders since you PROFIT from fraud anyway. While investors are cut "half" from fraud and the owners get 100% fees and taxes doesn't seem right to me and would perfectly explain why you aren't doing the homework.
even another user reported having negative returns opting out for autoinvest.
I saw the ALGORITHM talk about late means defaulted. I had 206 investments on the platform and my APR 6,61% BECAUSE I got to a point where I only lended to the same people like 3 or 4 HIGH AMOUNTS of bitcoin and they paid. Which means that if it wasn't for them I'd have even lower APR.
For more statistics (I lent 4,700 dollars) 48 out of my 203 investments got defaulted and that is 23,6% of fraud
I got 23,6% of fraud and in the end (an year) i got 6,61% APR. This means that this 18% is something close to a lie!
