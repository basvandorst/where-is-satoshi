I give it about 6 episodes before it get canceled.  Bitcoiners won't watch it and the general public will have not idea what it is all about.

Call This guy.  [Brian Klein](  He's been involved in a number of criminal and civil bitcoin cases and if he can't represent you he can probably recommend someone who can.

The ideal solution would be for you to generate a bunch of key pairs on whatever secure wallet you are using.  Then put the public keys on your payment site and deliver a fresh public key to each visitor who wanted to pay with bitcoin.  Then you would have payments send directly to addresses you control and avoid third parties and payment processors. However that would take some custom coding or a plug in for STORENVY.  The only payment option I see currently available is PAYPAL. I bet before the 2nd Q of 2015 you see PAYPAL add Bitcoin payments.  So maybe the best option is to sit tight for a few months.
The bitcoin economy needs user friendly, drop in code that guys like you can easily add to their site so they don't have to rely on third parties.

Terrific addition to the Chamber of Digital Chamber of Commerce team.  Hopefully the DCC can become an effective replacement for the Bitcoin Foundation which recently dropped its lobbying effort now that it is focusing solely on core development. I also have high hopes for Jerry Brito's Coin Center.  The more voices we have the better for industry.

Link to your site?  Do you run a bitcoind?  Do you want to hold btc after the sale or convert to fiat?

Absolutely.  Coinbase is required by law to make reasonable effort to identify you.  Thus the verification process.  Then they are required to connect any transaction you make to your name.  So any bitcoin you send from your coinbase account can always be traced back to you.

Excellent work. So many  want to discuss/debate the politics of the protocol but very few actually understand it.  
If you have not come across them yet, [Ken Sherriff](   [John Racliff](  and [Alan Reiner's]( work were invaluable resources when I was first parsing the protocol.   
If you need to ask specific technical questions I found team at the [ irc channel ( [Bitcoin in Golang]( ) much more friendly and accessible the the bitcoin-dev channel.
Regarding presentation, if you are able to edit the videos, I'd suggest trimming any pauses out of the video to make it shorter so the initial viewer can quickly watch the video then go back and stop and start if they actually want to work through the tutorial.
Either way it is great work.  Thanks for your contribution.

Nice article.  You may also want to add that currently very few blocks being created are full.  Some minors purposely create smaller blocks so they propagate faster.  So even if the block size does increase it does not mean miners will immediately fill them up.  No easy answers.

The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin was actually pretty good.  It is an accurate and even-keeled look at the early days of bitcoin. It will be an invaluable historical document.

Actually there was a conference before that in 2012 in New York City.

Peter Vessenes started the Bitcoin Foundation as cover for his shady bitcoin dealings.

~~If I'm not mistaken that conference was canceled.~~
My mistake.  I believe there was one unSystem conference in Europe around that time by Amir Taaki that was canceled
[Bitcoin London 2013]( did occur but that was in July of 2013 shortly after the San Jose conference.

Vessenes tried to scam in the Bitcoin Miner business a while back with his bogus company  [Alydian](  We ran into him at a bitcoin conference in NYC and he was selling "enterprise" units for $25K or some ridiculous price.  A group of investors wanted to buy three units.  They offered to fly to his "lab" in Seattle the next day to view the equipment before writing the check.  Vessenes came up with a million excuses why that was not possible.  Because they never existed.  Of course Alydian eventually went [bankrupt]( as most if not all of Vessenes' companies do.  What a scammer.
