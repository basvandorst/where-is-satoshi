This was pure material, where you could see a guy in the pool bury his head with the cringe waves oozing off the stage. It pains me that these are the people who speak up for Bitcoin the most. Nobody else in the audience was a better speaker than the suit wearing cowboy who came on a hot cruise with a backpack and script? I came to the comments section looking for "who is Jimmy song?" and now I left with the belief that Bitcoin doesn't have anyone to speak up for it properly.

Beginning of the summer I started ordering from my summer house.. My first order didn't go through, I got that canceled thing. Fine, I e-mailed them, informed them of my summer house IP and then gave them a calendar of when my orders would be appearing from that IP as opposed to my home where I opened the account. Every order thereafter went through. They didn't reply to me to even acknowledge it but it works now. Likely your IP changed, you're ordering from your phone or something fishy showed up their side. They are a business that must prevent fraud at all costs. Put yourself in their shoes, you can't take back Bitcoin once it's been given out. A few fraudulent orders ruin it for everyone else like me and you.

What's wrong with vbulletin or xenforo? I've never heard valid reasoning against using them by anyone.
Both are commercial products with full time employees supporting them. Most security features are patched, both allow 2 factor auth, and if bitcoin talk were to run either there would be a massive increase in modifications to support the site.
A transition to either would take less than an hour with the current number of users on a fast server and would likely increase features tenfold and customizability infinitely.
By trying to create your own forum software you open us up to new security and stability problems that have yet to be addressed. By going with something that has been vetted and tested thoroughly you know that you're getting a quality product that has support when you need it. The logic surrounding the forums being upgraded can be addressed in a matter of days, yet this whole thing had been dragged out years. The monthly cost of hosting on SMF is double what it would take to run a properly optimized commercial forum software, take this from someone with experience running forums for a decade.
Full disclosure: I offered my services to help transition the forum about 2 years ago for free and never heard back from so I'm not even expecting a response.

Contact them via phone and be as professional as possible. If they continue to ignore you or don't come to a conclusion, you can file a report with the better business bureau in their state as well as contact the attorney general and file a police report. The level of escalation should be scaled accordingly and let them know you don't want your order to fall through the cracks and that you're going to stay on top of them till they fulfill your order. They seem to be a legit business, I don't see why they'd ignore you if you even reached out to them through any of their social media accounts.

It's SMF , simple machines forum, software that's been out for far less than phpbb. Everytime this gets brought up we all go back to why theymos refuses to use a commercially supported forum like vbulletin, xenforo or ipb which run the biggest forums on the entire web.
My big forum (vbulletin) was ranked Alexa 6k before more sites globally outperformed it dropping to around 12k. The site still had a million users, and was more active during peak holidays. It's different for every niche but remember there is always something newer stealing the thunder.

@_date: 2014-12-02 02:08:39
Here are the reasons,
1- less searches for Bitcoin yield less results to the forum where it's discussed the most.
2- forum hacks, down times, scams, phishing links, aggressive keyword linking to spammy sites and gambling are all search engine ranking detractors.
The forum uses an older version of smf, something that could be imported into any commercial bb in under a few hours. The current forum has no specially designed scripts or services that could be affected by moving to another bulletin board.. It's just silly that theymos has allowed the board to slip like this and that the Bitcoin foundation supports this.
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:59:59
xenforo, vbulletin, and invision all have mods that can take these into account.. As well as importers. My first forum was smf as well and as soon as I made the license cost I moved to vbulletin. Couldn't have been smoother. Smf had an activity tracker that inflated the time spent on the board and that was a terribly inaccurate way to judge user activity. I should mention that the board has over a million users now and if I were to do it again I would now choose xenforo.

He's already decided the free software alternatives are not good enough... Theymos is not a coder as proven, just stick with plugins and use only the open source ones if that makes him feel better. There's also nodeBB which runs on nodejs and is gonna be pretty cool but it suffers from that thing that requires all new software to go through massive testing for scalability and security. Why he wants to force the forum community to alpha test more software and find out how deep that rabbit hole goes is beyond me.

Have your web developer add a "Bitcoin accepted here" logo to your footer.
I haven't attended a Bitcoin meetup since 2011 and I've avoided the 'scene' since.  - There's also the Bitcoin center:  for networking and whatnot and a cafe with buyers and sellers. For the most part, it's good to list yourself there. It won't drive business to you but it's likely that someone with Bitcoin would choose you over the competition for that reason alone.

I've used  to track some of my earliest coinbase transactions and some of them are 3~6 transactions away from gambling and dark net market type services even though they were directly to bitpay or bitstamp originally. I'm heavily reliant on coinbase for all my purchases and hot wallet type spending and I do not want my service cancelled on me. I've recently taken up using DarkWallet for it's coinjoin pockets and the .25 cents or so it cost to tumble it.. But in reality those coins end up just as dirty coming back to me from markets like Evolution and Agora. I just don't sell them back to coinbase at that point and send as originally intended to friends or fam.

I have 2fa setup on my bank account and if they were trying to login and use my info at that time I would've known. It's more or less for them not to get scammed. The whole asking about your intention could very well be them typing your username into google and finding you are an active poster on weed sites.
