Don't see any list of trusted vendors for paper wallets in the thread.  What are some?  Armory I assume?

Haha yea, that was a bit cringeworthy, but he might not have been expecting to get bum rushed like that.

You can use Multibit to import your private keys and you will not need to download the entire blockchain.

Obviously no one knows, but I personally think that the price will rise as people stop panicking and calm down.  I am buying today and will not wait.

What app is this?

Don't worry.  It has bubbled before and we came back.  We will rise again.  This is a long-term project, not a get rich quick scheme.

Great video, thanks for sharing!

Right now is a great time to buy.  We have seen bubbles in the past, we will see more bubbles in the future.  Buying on the dips is a great long term strategy.

Fair enough, but what is black and white is that the IMF has severely set back the economies of many developing countries based on erroneous assumptions and models.  Greece, although a developed nation, would be the most recent example.  
Economists can definitely add value by helping reject methods and approaches that have proven to be faulty.  But unfortunately the IMF has a bad habit of latching onto new, untested models and essentially forcing adoption by developing countries.  Certainly they have good intentions, but developing countries deserve more autonomy and a right to reject their approaches.

Seriously, look up what happened to previous people that tried to start their own currencies.  Respect his privacy, seriously.  You should delete this post.

+1, the OP's comments about bitcoins are pretty daft.

Why do you think a correction is desperately needed?

Umm no, that is just one major reason amongst many...
