I've heard this before where some millenial asked Antonopoulos about early adopters forfeiting some of their bitcoin to others. 
He reminded the young socialist that if Bitcoin failed, those early adopters would not have been bailed out by the same people that think they should get free bitcoin. So, with risk comes reward. The earlier someone invested in Bitcoin, the more risk there was of this new, unknown asset. More risk, more reward. 
Early adopters didn't steal money from later adopters. Despite early adopters' best efforts to persuade others to also get in early, the late comers insisted otherwise. They can't now claim their prerogative to join late is money stolen from them.

I bought gold a decade ago at around  $1,300 per ounce because Peter told me to in his books and vlogs. He kept saying *one day* it will be $5,000 per ounce.
A decade later gold is almost the same price and, even if it *was* $5,000 now, I'd still regret I didn't instead invest in Bitcoin a decade ago. 
Before I sold my gold, I always worried if it was getting stolen whenever it wasn't with me. When it was with me,  I always worried about unjustified civil asset forfeiture by opportunistic cops, the TSA, et cetera. I don't worry about my Bitcoin being taken from me without my knowledge and consent.

This is about  inflation. This is about  why gold and bitcoin is better money than fiat.
He's saying every time the banks print more dollars and then introduce into the economy by giving it to themselves to spend, the rest of us that worked for our dollars had our money's value transferred over to their out-of-thin-air money.

I do think his tweet is disingenuous. The man has put everything into gold and has many people that will feel betrayed if they decide he led them astray in their own investments.

I think Andreas' inner circle that helps him manage our perception of him has taken down those videos that I'm referring to. They're hard to find since 1st seeing them. I regret I didn't keep a copy to help make my point here. 
1. He can't seem to make it through one presentation without barking out the word FUCK! or some other obscenity. Hey, I say it too for strong emphasis as appropriate but he promises to keep being so obnoxious even if children are present. 
2. There's one video with him yelling at his audience almost throughout the presentation. Remember that video of some old guy in a nice suit screaming at the audience "Bitcoin is going to zero! ZERO! ZERO!!!" Well, Andreas doesn't say that but this one particular video of his shows him being  just as hostile to all the nice people that came to see him. It's embarrassing to watch. 
3. A lot of people are excited to meet this celebrity. When they finally get their chance to stand up with a question, they may choke as the entire auditorium quietly looks and listens to them, Andrea's on stage included. They don't have the public speaking experience Andreas has developed and you see him clown his fan by making a small, circular motion with his hand, interrupting the person with his own question, rhetorically asking "Is there a question anywhere in this? C'mon with the question already!" Wow. If I traveled and spent money to bring my question to him and he punked me like that in front of everyone, I think I would have said "Um, no; no question. Go fuck yourself."
There are other reasons I can also cite but this comment is getting kinda long now. In summary, Andreas already exhibited a pissed off demeanor even in his early videos. But now with his fame, he's become cocky. The worst outcome though is watching him claim he doesn't have the faintest idea what criticism anyone has of him when asked. He lies for the sake of his brand image.

I don't think possession of one million dollars worth of Bitcoin qualifies as being a whale but that is well beyond my personal realm of Bitcoin experience.

@_date: 2019-07-09 15:03:05
When you share an address to receive money from someone, you  can give either type of these three addresses. You can freely toggle among them. Mycelium  will  handle them all as one wallet in your UI.
Moreover, you can tell Mycelium to mix them as change addresses. For example, when a blockchain analysis entity studies your transactions, they may see a legacy address (that starts with 1) send funds to a segwit address (that starts with  3) and to another segwit address (that starts with bc1). Theyll think you paid two different  people and not know that bech32 address (bc1) is your transaction change being returned to your (supposed) legacy wallet. 
Oh, snap!

He's a great Bitcoin speaker but he's not polite and respectful. 
He's always obscene onstage. When asked if he'd still keep dropping so many casual F-bombs when children are present in the audience, he firmly replied "**Yes I would**".
He hates so much when someone says something inaccurate in a tweet about  him, you'll see him tweet to the world something embarrassing at the other person's expense.
When asked recently at the LondonReal interview  why some people would disapprove of him, he was disingenuous, dismissing such a notion to the extremely hard odds of pleasing everyone when you're a celebrity. He deliberately didn't  admit he has been advocating the socialists' universal income agenda. On stage, he laughed about how betrayed the libertarians that started Bitcoin would be to know that about him. I've seen the video but can't find it again. He may have taken it down to hide it from more of us.
Have you noticed how he *bows* at the end of his presentations? Who else does that? He's gotten so much positive feedback about his public speaking, he's inflated with his celebrity so much now that he ends his speeches like a thespian curtain call. As if he really anticipates people may throw roses to his feet.
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:47:02

I once went to Party City to rent one of those 5 foot tall cylinders filled with helium, meant to fill many balloons. It's expensive but that one time they said it's crazy expensive because there's a shortage. Helium floats up to the stratosphere. It's scarce for us and has its own economic expense to collect. But we don't use it as hard money. 
Silver is becoming more like helium. Something we'll still use that's not plentiful and easy to acquire but it's dying as money. Bitcoin and other better things are happening.

@_date: 2019-11-07 12:55:53
I don't know the tax in your country but I think I can still reply to this question. 
I receive my bitcoin paycheck every two weeks. I don't buy dips. I don't time the market. Regardless of what's happening to BTC price, I get paid every two weeks. 
So how has that been working out for me? For over a year now, most of my transactions have been gains, meaning every time I spend my paycheck, the bitcoin being spent was worth more in the days/weeks that followed since that payday. 
Lately, I'm seeing losses because of the drop from $14k BTC. But here's the thing; I keep meticulous records of my transaction history and I can see that my losses are only lowering the current tally of my net gains. 
I won't doxx myself here so let's just say my running gains so far this year are $30,000. The current losses I'm sustaining (because I must continually sell this type of money which is the only type I have been earning) have moved my current total down to +$25,000. This isn't a bad thing. Most everyone is still happy to add an additional $25k to their annual income, and I am, **simply by opting to earn bitcoin rather than buy bitcoin with dollars earned**. 
Even if my gains fell from $30,000 to $5,000 by end of year, bitcoin still maintains an overall gains trajectory. A fall in price is temporary whereas the horizon value is sunny. Says me, a bitcoin earner with first hand experience.

Think about what I already said. 
If I only get paid with bitcoin, then bitcoin is all I have unless I sell it for dollars. This is just like you getting paid in dollars and dollars is all you have unless you buy bitcoin with your dollars. 
It's easier for you to buy things with dollars than trade your dollars for bitcoin and then spend that bitcoin to get things. It's easier for me to buy things with bitcoin than trade it for dollars and then spend those dollars on things.
@_date: 2019-11-14 15:35:42
As much as I can help it, I spend bitcoin instead of selling it for dollars to spend. What I must still do with dollars, I sell only that much bitcoin to do so.
I had a job once that paid me by check in the mail. I'd wait days for it and sometimes it would get lost in the mail. When that happened, they'd mail out another one and I'd wait days for it. 
I've had other jobs that did direct deposit. But even then, I'd have to wait at least one business day before my money was really my money. Then when I'd try to withdraw it, they'd give me a hard time about large withdrawals. They'd give me a hard time about large deposits too. 
Ever since getting paid in bitcoin, I get my paycheck just 10 minutes after payroll happens, and all of my money is in my complete possession &amp; control. I love it. More people will gradually opt to use the Bitcoin payment network, even if still agreeing to a fiat based unit of account regarding their wage rate.

If this plays out as expected, everyone later will say your move was an obvious win and that they would have done the same if the timing of their own circumstances allowed for it. 
If, by chance, bitcoin goes into a long stall and lull, people holding their breath now will be waiting to say *I told you so*. But they don't want to be quoted for the record until they're more sure of that outcome. 
Like yourself, I'm also making long term bets on bitcoin. If we don't see the expected gains years (and decades) later, the sacrifices made will be unfortunate; both money and time. But we've done our homework, assessed the options, and made our decisions. So, now we'll see eventually what happens.
Of course, you must do what you think is right.

I too earn bitcoin. I switched my $2XX,XXX income from dollars to BTC over a year ago. Because bitcoin is all I earn, I must keep selling some to pay the fiat bills though. 
Maybe someday people will come together somewhere to start a new town where everyone there agrees to make bitcoin the primary medium of exchange. Dentists, plumbers, every one of the local town's people. That would be the next great leap for me; only spending, not selling, this real money. 
Congratulations on joining the Earners Club. A lot of people don't get it still when I tell them it's better to earn bitcoin than to buy bitcoin with dollars earned. They have to experience the difference to understand, I suppose.

In a fair court of law, nobody is jailed based on no-evidence accusations of others. 
This post is an interesting field study of perceptions. You, for example, assume my declaration that bitcoin is beyond seizure infers guilt that I intend to cheat. When actually, I keep meticulous records that are beyond reproach should I ever be audited about my bitcoin history, and my celebratory remark is about not having even more taken from me than owed by the welfare statists employed at the IRS. 
I honestly wonder what the team pep-talks are like among those people at that place of work.
Alright, team! It's another day; another opportunity. Never forget how many people of entitlement are depending on us to extract more funding from those evil earners out there.

Let's say you and I both buy the same style house in the same neighborhood. You paid $250k for your house and I paid $300k for my house. Same track home! Same area! I can't report a $50k loss. We each take responsibility for the price we each agreed to.
When you pay $105 for bitcoin, you report your purchases price of **your** bitcoin as $105 regardless of what your bitcoin app says the price is, regardless of how much more or less other people's fees were. $105 is in fact how much that bitcoin cost you to obtain.
If you sell it later for $200 and lose $5 to fees, then you report a ($195 - $105 =) $90 gain.
An important note about losses. Whereas there's no upper limit to how much gains must be reported, the IRS does throttle losses. For example,  if you bought 1 bitcoin for $10k and sold it for $3k, that's a $6k loss. But come tax time, you can only subtract up to $3k loss per year. So, you report ($50k - $3k =) $47k income next tax season, carrying over the additional $3k loss to the IRS next year to subtract from your annual income.

When Germany stood up the Berlin Wall, they told they're citizens it was to keep people out. But they were experiencing brain drain so they trapped their people captive.
I worry about a socialist president not in office yet using Trump's Wall to trap us in the same way and forcing us to spend/share the new world reserve currency inside the States.

You're making multiple assumptions of how things may be someday, not how they are now. 
Currently, spending bitcoin is a taxable event like selling bitcoin for fiat. 
Currently, all bitcoin transactions are taxable gains events, regardless of the size of the transaction.

Your history is on the open, transparent blockchain ledger. They just need to figure out which ones are the transactions you made. They can do that if they can figure out who's been forwarding money to you or who you've forwarded money to.
But to force someone to tell them these things; yeah, I think they need a warrant for that. Wasn't it a subpoena that the IRS served Coinbase a couple of years ago?

The US tax law, as it is now, says *all* crypto transactions are taxable events; both large and small. So, complete compliance means doing the math for each transaction to report on your IRS form 8949 as part of your annual tax paperwork submission. 
If you skip the little ones, the IRS may decide it's not worth their time to sweat the small stuff. But if you want perfect paperwork so that they don't bother you when they go after hodlers, then report everything. 
Keep in mind, what you think today is a transaction too small to bother with may later be a sizable amount. Imagine when every satoshi is the equivalent of one US penny.

When zooming out to see the trend of price across the last 200 days, we're seeing a positive slope of 1.47. So, the suggestion of the slope is, on average, whatever bitcoin was bought as of 200 days ago has seen 47% gains now. 
A 1.0 value would mean bitcoin's trajectory is going perfectly sideways in price. 
But we're at 0.76, meaning the current progress of price is down and behind what we'll normally see across a 200 day range. It doesn't promise future price but, statistically speaking, it suggests an upward price to catch up to the average trend. The lower this value, the more likely it'll pop upward soon. 
Same goes for when it's above the average 1.47. Last summer at $14k, I think the value was 2.X (I say X because I don't remember if it was 2.2 or 2.8). And when we were going up to the ATH of $20k in 2017, I recollect the value was 4.X then, meaning it was overpriced.
Bitcoin would be a lot easier for everyone's nerves if only it was 1.47 every day and not so choppy up and down.

I still use centralized exchanges as a plan B when I need to sell a lot of bitcoin fast but Bisq is usually my first choice for the sake of supporting the platform by helping to give it more liquidity. The only hangup with Bisq still for me is that it doesn't yet do Bech32 native segwit. Hopefully that's around the corner. 
Did you notice Bisq has a phone app? It notifies you that a posted trade has advanced forward without you monitoring the desktop GUI to know. Convenient. 
I find that trading via US Money Orders is the most desirable option. Whereas the banks set trading limits via Zelle which are susceptible to reversal, a buyer can send multiple $1,000 money orders together as a payment to trade higher amounts anonymously and which is harder to scam a bitcoin seller with.

Okay, here we go. 
Let's say you earn $50,000 per year. Forget about Bitcoin for a moment. This is your normal,  fiat income. 
Now, you buy 1 bitcoin in 2019 for $10k. When it's time to pay annual taxes, you're only taxed on that $50k as usual. 
Now, it's another tax year; 2020. You still earn $50k at your job but you sold your 1 bitcoin for $50k, a $40k profit. You now report your annual income as $50k + $40k = $90k. $90k is the where in the 2020 tax table you'll go to learn how much tax you owe, percentage-wise.
This is why you have to track both the price of bitcoin when you bought it and also when you sold it. Only then can you determine the difference as a gain or loss to add as part of your annual income.

I track my gains to stay honest with the taxman. Even if it tanked now, I'd only slowly bleed money as I keep paying one bill after another over time.

Thanks for noticing my post. Here's a question (premised with some statements).
When I was someone's employee, my direct deposit went to a bank account associated with my SSN (tax ID) and regarded as my personal account. 
When I started my business, my invoices were remitted to a bank account associated to my LLC's EIN (tax ID) and regarded as my business account. 
I could not cash personal checks at my business account. I could not cash business checks at my personal account. The system enforces these two as separate entities. 
When my clientele started remitting my business invoices with bitcoin, I didn't need a business account at the bank anymore. It stopped serving  a purpose and I freed up the minimum mandatory $3k balance required to have that account open. I kept my personal account where I sell bitcoin so I can pay fiat bill's each month. 
Now the question; does it matter where the money is coming from when dollars are sent to my BitWage account? Whether it's a business remitting my business invoice or an employer sending my paycheck? Or everything works the same regardless? Fiat in; crypto out?
@_date: 2019-08-24 07:12:19
Bitcoin will be like a tsunami. 
While everyone experiences their own cashflow crisis during the depression, bitcoin price will be like watching the tide suck into the ocean. As much as people want to hodl, they'll need to liquidate what they can to make ends meet short term. 
Later, after the transitionary suffering has finally gotten over the hump, people will agree even more that bitcoin is better money and their desire to avoid that same said suffering again anytime soon will have everyone rallying to grab their bags. The price of bitcoin will be like an epic wave coming up the beach, overwhelming everything.

If a gig worker has their entire paycheck sent to BitWage, how does BitWage forward the fiat as crypto? Do you provide BitWage an xpub public key to your wallet so they can pre-determine your next wallet address?

Leverage the IRS.
I accidentally made one, innocent mistake in my tax forms' arithmetic and just got a letter from the IRS that I owe many thousands of dollars more from 2018.
Because I didn't pay it all earlier, I bought so much more bitcoin near $3k then. So, I can give them that money now and I still have 3 - 4 times more bitcoin I otherwise wouldn't have achieved had I paid all that I owed in the first place. 
Unlike credit cards and bank loans, the IRS has the cheapest interest rate at 0.5%. So, I think I'll not pay it all upfront but instead request being put on a payment plan. Maybe when bitcoin hits $20k, or $50k, or $100k, I'll pay that overdue tax in full. But then, despite accruing interest for making them wait, I'll be even richer.

Some things are only worth full units. For example, if I was building  a brick wall, I may purchase 1,500 bricks or maybe 1,501. But I'd never ask for 1,500 and some crumbs. 
This is the same reason people make the mistake of buying altcoins. They think they need full units but want them at a cheaper rate. The official 1.0 value of a bitcoin is a mirage. A satoshi is still a satoshi, no matter whether you bought 100,000,000 or less. The more, the better, but possessing at least 100,000,000 satoshi is nothing especially important.

Keep a journal to record how much coin you bagged and at what cost, including date.
Record how much coin you spilled and at what cost, including date. 
Come annual tax time, use IRS Form 8949 to list the two facts above for each transaction and calculate the difference as a gain or loss. Add that one-page form to your normal tax forms you submit each year.
When you pay tax, it's based, not on dollars earned, but on value earned, measured in dollars. For example, if you sold your labor for a sack of potatoes once a week, you wouldn't surrender 20% of your 52 sacks of potatoes to the IRS. You would determine how many dollars &amp; cents each sack was worth at time of acquisition and forfeit 20% of that dollar value to the government. So, even if you made a living only using potatoes for money, the government mandates you obtain dollars, even if only for the purpose of paying tribute to Caesar once a year for your continued freedom.
When I earn just bitcoin all year, I report the total dollar value of that bitcoin as my income. If you earned $100,000, regardless of whether you were paid only with dollars or bitcoin, you'd report to the IRS that you earned $100,000. But then you add up your net total of gains and losses. Let's say you made a net of $25,000 into transaction gains. You're final disclosure to the IRS is that you made $125,000 for the year. That's it. You use that number in the tax tables to see what percentage you owe in tax like you always have before. 
I heard about a lot of people, including Andrea's Antonopoulos, getting a letter after last tax season that the IRS didn't think they reported their crypto matters correctly or in full. But all my crypto related paperwork was accepted for last year without issue, implying I am in good standing with the IRS. I say this to infer I know how to stay in the authority's good graces while I make a bitcoin living. Don't be afraid of consequences if you do what I'm doing. The government is allowing us a path forward whereby we can embrace bitcoin as our way of life. Just stay on that compliant path.

To my fellow veterans here that applaud this taxation theft, can you loan me your bitcoin? I promise to pay the debt back to you...and then when I reneg on that promise, don't hold me accountable to my commitment. Just remember:

When the Democratic Socialist party of Germany stood up the Berlin Wall, they told the people it's to keep people out. They didn't admit it was to stop the Brain Drain happening to their society. Even if Trump has good intentions, a subsequent socialist leader may use Trump's wall to trap us in. 
I think the government wants a list of everyone hodling before bitcoin moons. Afterwards, everyone on the list will be regarded as a capital flight risk when trying to travel beyond our borders. We may see a policy that states we can only take up to $50k worth of BTC while abroad. Maybe less. The remainder must be left behind in our government issued custodial wallet. They'll promise us we can have it back when we return to the States.

I used to have an account with four different banks. Now I have only one which I only use to send checks out with. It's my last proxy/bridge into the fiat system.
After selling bitcoin, by other means than a centralized exchange, I deposit that cash to clear monthly checks issued. 
Most people earn dollars, and maybe use it to buy bitcoin with whatever is left over after paying their bills. But my experience has been that my progress of accumulation has been much more assertive when I earn bitcoin and sell for dollars only as much as necessary to pay those bills in which the receiver is still insisting on fiat only.

This is why I work 1099 instead of FTE or W2. Then they can't seize my paycheck. I even make them wait for my taxes instead of paying quarterly taxes. The negligible interest rate fine is more than offset by the gains of hodling bitcoin with tax money owed.

This video is 4.5 years old. The price of BTC at that time was about $285. Back then the competition to post transactions in a block was so small, that's why he says sending bitcoin is free. But still, this presentation has aged well. It's one of my favorite bitcoin introduction videos.

This is one of the reasons I switched from FTE to contract labor. When I was an FTE working so much free overtime, I was always told how we're all in this together and we each must do what must be done for the sake of the company that keeps us employed. 
I wanted to get paid for all those nights, weekends, and holidays so I switched to hourly wage instead of base salary. But as a contractor, even when I say I want to stay late for the sake of the company, then they always say no, you did your 40; now go home to your family because life/work balance is important. We insist, they tell me.
I do pay for my own medical and other such things. But these are all tax deductions I couldn't claim before as someone's FTE. Not only do I earn more,  I pay less tax than my poorer FTE coworkers. Like I said, I learned how to play the corporate game better than them.

A software developer nowadays is offered fulltime employment (FTE) for around $75k - $125k. Seniors make more like $125k - $150k. A W2 employee is typically about the same as FTE. But if you learn how to negotiate your services to corporations as a freelance consultant, you can earn $1XX per hour like me.
I'm just a programmer that sits along side my colleagues that are earning $65,000 per year, doing the same work as them. But I earn more than triple their salaries because I learned how to play the game better than them. Every corporate executive knows what I'm talking about and they're cool with it as long as I stay quiet and turn a blind eye to my coworkers' ignorance being exploited.

Earning bitcoin directly is better than buying bitcoin with fiat earned. The latter way keeps me enslaved in the surveillance banking system. 
I still remember how sucky the customer service is when I finally get to the front of the teller's line but those days are long over for me. I used to wait 1 - 5 business days after payday to take possession of my money, and only as long as I don't cash withdrawal too much right away. Now, I'm in absolute control of my money 10 minutes after payday actually happens. 
Did you know Wells Fargo already tells their customers their money is their money unless they're using it to buy bitcoin. That is not allowed. I never ask permission how to use/move my money. 
I personally know someone who said the IRS wanted more money and that he wasn't replying fast enough to their letters. He said suddenly all his bank account balances were zero. Then when he called the IRS, he said the first thing they said on the call was "we've got your attention now, don't we". By moving all my wealth onto the blockchain, these entitled statists will never own me in such a helpless, humiliating fashion.

People defend their crypto adoption decision based on the faith of price mooning. But even if it stays still from here on out, you're still better off being your own bank.
1. When I opened a business account with Bank of America, they required I maintain a minimum $3,000 balance. Basically a free loan to them just so that I could clear checks made to my business's name.
2. My local credit union closed my savings account, citing they hadn't heard from me in a while as cause. They didn't bother to first call, write, email, or text me. They imposed an involved obstacle course for me to navigate completely if I want to recover my savings.
3. Chase Bank suddenly closed **all** of my accounts with no warning after I made a large cash withdrawal (which they *were* consensual with at the teller counter). They didn't care what calamity that caused for me as a bill payer and direct deposit recipient.
There are many reasons to remove our dependency (subservience, really) from the banks. They don't deserve us. We will always give ourselves better customer service.

I hear you but let me rewind the clock  and consider that outcome. 
90% of my two paychecks per month were spent on bills and related expenses. Each month, I had a remaining 10% to do as I please, like going to the movies, being served pizza and beer, et cetra.
If I began my plan at the start of the last crypto winter, I would have kept accumulating bitcoin with my 10% discretionary money. The other 90% would have been immediately liquidated upon arrival to not risk missing bill payments. 
Still, eventually the tide of change would have come like we all knew it *eventually* would. Then, my 10%'s would each keep growing in value until I already have enough potential profit among them to pay all the bills **without** cashing out my next crypto paycheck at all.
That's when the train really starts to move down the tracks. When I'm not waiting for my 10%'s to appreciate in value but my entire paycheck grows, allowing me to skip another paycheck as untouched. Then a 3rd paycheck skipped. Then a 4th left untouched. And so on.
I'm not hypothesizing. I'm telling you my story. Yes, my timing was good but I think starting at the wrong time would not have rekt me but only stalled the same outcome.

Yes, we can further subdivide a satoshi and then people with bitcoin can disperse more across the world. 
But it's important to remember to get a bitcoin now while you still can. Unlike printing money to meet world demand for circulation, subdividing a satoshi doesn't steal any wealth from those that already hold bitcoin.
One day most people can never possess one whole bitcoin. When we update the bitcoin software to move the decimal place further out than 8 places, everyone holding 1 BTC will be crazy rich. And it will still be just as scarce then as is now.

That's why I chose the Model 3 instead of the Model X.
That's a great link you shared but my circumstances are different. I don't occasionally buy and hodl bitcoin. I earn it. 
I negotiated terms of compensation at the new gig to be paid in BTC instead of dollars. I haven't *earned a dollar* in over a year. But all my billers still want fiat so I must sell bitcoin every month. 
I strive to save and be more frugal than before Bitcoin came into my life but I'm also opting to enjoy these days now also. It's a balance. I feel I've accrued enough already for my future that I can now spend a little more, sooner. How much is enough for the future is a personal decision for each individual.

Dear Mr Bitcoin Whale,
The others don't understand you like I do. Your real name is Mr Banks. You have people dispatched across Paxful and Localbitcoins offering to buy people's bitcoin P2P in addition to your OTC channels. You gradually accumulate and then dump it all on the exchange, driving down price. 
Rinse &amp; repeat. You quietly accumulate off the exchange and then dump it all on the exchange. That's why things were so quiet at 6k before falling suddenly. That's how you got us down to 3k. Now it's quiet again. Is 2.5k our next stop? 
Tell me Mr Banks, are you just going to keep doing this until you've decimated Bitcoin? Will you never stop spending the fiat only you're allowed to freely print to keep this price manipulation going?

1.0 means no change. If we forget about inflation, then the Dollar is 1.0. $100 today is $100 next month.
But Bitcoin value changes relative to the Dollar. The Mayer Multiple of 2.1 is how much more valuable BTC is today compared to when you bought it 200 days ago. When it bottomed around $3,200, I recall the Mayer Multiple was 0.7.
When The Mayer Multiple is below 1.0, you can think of Bitcoin as *on sale*. The higher it is above 1.48, the more you can think of its price as hyped/pumped in the short term.
If Trace Mayer weighs in here, he'd explain this better and may reveal my explanation/understanding as uninformed.

I appreciate your skepticism. Thank you for sharing it with tact. 
So far, it seems that the elite are choosing to join the new crypto world instead of insisting they can't afford to lose to it. Ameritrade, Fidelity, Bakkt, police pension investment programs, and many others would lose if crypto was stopped. We have so much infrastructure tech being built, a lot of rich people would demand compensation if told to shut it all down. 
You may be right but this old fear that authority will forbid it is slowly wilting away as authority adapts to it. Lately, it seems the worst thing that will happen is extensive regulation around crypto but not an all out ban. 
We'll see.

I've lost count of how many recruiters / headhunters said no to me when I asked to be paid in bitcoin instead of dollars. But I kept asking. Then, finally,  someone said okay. The change is slow but more employers will accommodate this preference as more and more of us keep asking. 
I encourage everyone to do the same. Every time someone spams your phone or inbox asking you to leave your job to fill their vacancy elsewhere, spam them back the following:
I'm currently earning bitcoin instead of dollars and I love it. Let me know if you also can accommodate that preference.
One of two things will happen next. Either are outcomes you want. Either you found your own bitcoin employer or they will not want to spam you anymore with their recruiter noise. When too many people respond this way to their spam, they'll finally bend to the demand for the sake of finding resources and that will grow this new space of economic liberty.

I use the Eclair app on Android. It's easy opening channels after forwarding some bitcoin to that wallet. Because it's a phone app, it's not online all the time. 
My only suggestion how to improve it is helping the user understand the "new channel" choices. I didn't initially understand:
1. Paste a Node URI
2. Scan a Node URI
3. Random Node
4. ACINQ Node
But I came to realize I should open direct channels with those entities I have interest engaging with via Lightning BTC. For example, I use  to pay at Amazon.com so I opened a channel with them. I also use  to reload a channel with new money after it gets low so I opened another channel with them too.

As for how to get it, try earning it. Whether you offer mowing lawns and asking for that as payment or you learn a better paying gig. I earn a six figure income and I kept asking employers for it until someone said yes. Now my paychecks are all straight crypto. I don't need a bank to get paid anymore.

Let me be more specific then. 
1. In ZigZag's web form I chose sending on-chain BTC for Lightning BTC back to me.
2. I gave my lightning-receiving address (invoice) from my Eclair app.
3. I used desktop Electrum to send the on-chain BTC amount specified.
4. I also used the same wallet on desktop Electrum to provide a return address in case the deal didn't successfully go through and they needed to refund my BTC back to me as still on-chain.
That's it. After I submitted the form, I ran an errand and the blockchain transaction had already reached a minimum number of confirmations before I got back. I could see both on ZigZag's webpage and in my Eclair wallet's channel that the lightning BTC was delivered.
I don't know if it matters but I had ZigZag send Lightning to my channel that I opened directly to Moon's Lightning node. I also have an open, loaded channel directly to ZigZag's Lightning node.
I used the filter option at the following URL with naming keywords to help me learn the node address to both of these entities to open direct channels to them -

2018 wasn't a good year for this idea but this isn't a 1 year loan. 
Imagine I already did this 7 years ago and we now have the benefit of hindsight. Despite 2018 (and 2015 was a bear too, wasn't it), if I chose not to liquidate $50k worth of BTC in 2012 to settle a debt but to sell it off piecewise over the last 84 months, we'd agree the strategy played out very well, right?

I kept asking recruiters to have the job pay me in Bitcoin until someone said okay. It's been a year since I've *earned* a dollar. 
All my billers still want fiat so I always have Bitcoin that needs to be sold but that's a better problem than the opposite. Bitcoin keeps growing in value so it takes me longer to spend a paycheck than when it was dollar denominated. For the 1st time in my life, my paychecks are getting backed up, waiting to be spent. Maybe if Bitcoin's growth can slow down down some, I can catch up on trying to spend the money. It's a nice problem.

Spank me?
You bring up an interesting point I was about to expand into. But we need to agree on the premise - Bitcoin is a hard money that will continue appreciating against the Dollar.
Forget the car for a moment. What if this was a personal cash loan to be paid over seven years? What if I took the money to buy and hold BTC, and that I'd liquidate it, just a little each month, to pay the fiat loan back? 84 months later, I expect to:
1. Pay the debt off, including interest.
2. Have new money I didn't have before the loan because of the BTC appreciation.
Didn't a lot of college kids do this with their student loans? And that's a 10 year loan. Yes, 2018 was a long winter but for those that scraped by and still hodled, I think they'll wipe away that debt in this next bull run plus keep gains. 
There is always risk. But whereas the middle class minded citizen may describe this as irresponsible, I think the wealthy privately admit this is what separated them from us.

Right. 
 made their browser plugin called Moon that runs in Chrome, Brave, (or Opera too, I think). At  checkout, the plugin embeds into the Amazon page a "Pay With Moon" button. It looks native, as if Amazon did that themselves. You're shown a modal (pop-up) window of the Lightning invoice to pay.

This is a valid question. I'd like to hear the people behind the ZigZag service respond also. 
The difference is small but I'll make the argument.
Opening and closing channels are both on-chain. That's a double miner fee. This service will do it for as little as no fee or as much as the same on-chain double fee, depending on how much you're transferring. I just checked; 0.005 BTC was no fee whereas 0.04 BTC was a 0.000636 BTC fee (same as two on-chain fees).
In addition to possibly extra cost, the two consecutive on-chain transactions when reopening channels takes twice as long in wait time as the one transaction-confirmation wait time using ZigZag's service.
If I were to keep reopening channels, I'd have to keep going back online to look up the node addresses of who I want to re-establish channels with. This is error prone. There's more than one node calling itself Moon, for example, and I almost picked the wrong one before.
I don't know why but my Eclair phone app keeps the history of closed channels. I can't seem to purge them. It's a growing, immutable list in my UI, it seems. It infers to me that channels aren't intended to be closed and reopened over and over. I can still choose to do so but I concede it nudges me to strive for reloading channels rather than recreating them.

Here's how it finally happened for me. I have to make this reply longer than preferred to give context but here goes.
**Part I**
A coworker once told me how a former employment of his had a rumor going round that the company was near bankrupcy and may not make payroll. Nobody believed the rumor but him. Right after direct deposit happened again, he withdrew all his money and closed his bank account. A day or two later, all direct deposits were reversed and the staff were let go. He said he was the only employee to get his last paycheck. 
This story led me to visit my bank and ask about only permitting my employer with direct deposit and *not* direct withdrawal. My Chase banker said it's not possible. That granting direct deposit implicitly infers possible reversal by the payer.
As a workaround, I was told to get paid by check instead of direct deposit because, whereas with direct deposit I give the employer my bank account information, a check means the employer instead gives me their bank account information. Assuming the check clears, it doesn't risk reversal like with direct deposit.
**Part II**
I had a nefarious employer that agreed to mail me checks (from across the country) but then I wasn't getting them on the agreed pay dates. When I reported not getting paid, he'd claim mail got lost in transit and he'll resend another one. In truth, he was doubling his time window between work served and work paid for. I decided, going forward, to negotiate into future contracts a penalty fee to reimburse a stalled paycheck.
**Part III**
A new, prospective employer wanted to hire me, and I agreed to the work. But when they asked for my bank info to begin direct deposit, I explained that I'd rather get paid by check. They were fine with that but they didn't like my late fee clause in the terms of employment. They said it's not fair to them if, for example, my mailed check is stuck in a blizzard. That it's out of their control. 
That's when I suggested a compromise. I said if my money is sent to me through the bitcoin payment network, then neither of us have to share our bank information with the other. That I need not worry about lost payments in transit. I'll be paid just 10 minutes after they claim to have paid me. That I won't be troubled by any threat of payment reversal.
They agreed. They admitted not already understanding bitcoin but they opened an account with an exchange and learned how to do business via bitcoin. After experiencing it with me as a positive payout alternative, that company has since started doing the same for others upon request.

I use personal examples.
When I would come to Bank of America to make a large deposit, they'd stop the line and call someone remote. They would tell the phone about me, asking the person on the other end of the call if I should be allowed to make my deposit. People in line behind me started scowling at me 15 minutes later as we all still waited. Finally, the teller said the deposit will be allowed and that I have *permission* to leave.
One day, my Chase card was denied at the gas pump. When I stepped into a local branch to get this fixed, they said it's no mistake and they're closing all accounts I have at Chase immediately. They said it's permanent and non-reversible. I reminded them 
1. I've had an account with them for years without incident.
2. That I finally fully paid the home equity loan from pre-2008 while so many others defaulted on them. 
3. That I've never missed a bill or paid late.
4. That my credit score is 824.
They didn't care and they refused to tell me why. When I told them they should call the police if they suspect a crime and I'll wait for them to arrive, they asked me to just leave.
I had a 3rd bank account with a local credit union since the 1990s. When I couldn't login last year, I called in for assistance. They said my account has been closed and my money was forwarded somewhere obscure within the bureacracy of my State government. The reason they cited was only that they hadn't heard from me in a while. It was 2 - 3 years since I last logged in. I asked why they didn't reach out to me first. They said they had. But they have my mailing address, my mobile number, and my email address and I never heard from them.
Ever since I took a new job that agreed to pay me via bitcoin, all these issues have gone away. My direct deposits bypass the banks and sit securely in my blockchain wallet, waiting to be spent. I do with my money whatever I please. Authoratative permission not needed. I haven't *earned* a dollar for over a year now and I love it. **Be your own bank.**

The employer reports how much value was paid to me, true. But the IRS form has the payer describe the value in terms of dollars. The form does not also have a checkmark to indicate whether the actual money provided was fiat itself, bitcoin, or something else.
The good deed is on me to volunteer to the IRS the extra fact that, yes, I was paid X amount worth of dollars but, moreover, it was bitcoin transmitted to me; not US fiat.
@_date: 2019-12-11 23:00:17
I mostly agree with this list.


I have been earning bitcoin throughout 2019. I **literally** haven't earned one US dollar all year. I have to spend bitcoin to acquire groceries and everything else being that bitcoin is the only money I have.  
Every two weeks, someone on the other side of the continent texts me the heads up that it's payday and 10 minutes later I'm in complete possession of all my new money.
Because I admit to this so often, and in social media, I assume I'm on a list to have my annual tax returns combed over more closely. So I have been keeping exact records of every taxable event. Therefore, I always know exactly where I stand regarding gains and losses. The year isn't over yet but, tentatively speaking, I will be reporting thousands of dollars in gains this year.
I love how I get all of my money so fast. And, as I watch the news, how secure I feel not to be another victim of negative rates, seizure, throttled withdrawals, the next Cyprus incident, and so on.

Bitcoin is understood and used differently among different people. This sub is visited by all walks of life. I was just volunteering *my* interpretation of how to use bitcoin. I follow this sub to learn from others' volunteering their own practices of it.
As for the pay rate, that wasn't the point of my post. I am posting from an anonymous account. I think I'd post instead from my real account if this was about my financial ego's affirmation.

When paid in dollars, the payer does report it and the recipient also acknowledges it to the IRS. This doesn't change because the network used to transmit the money was the Bitcoin payment network instead of the banks' payment network. 
However, the IRS does not know that I was sent X amount of bitcoin. Only that I was sent X worth of dollar value from the payer. So I still pay income tax but I've achieved more privacy regarding bitcoin. The govt doesn't know how much BTC I have because I didn't get any from a KYC exchange. My employer did and chainalysis can only say that their acquired money was forwarded to *somewhere*.

I think Trace Mayer coined that expression and has reused it more often than anyone else, but still he's gotten so many more people to say it too that I've gone somewhat deaf to remembering its meaning. It's become more of a sound to me now in the bitcoin community like a wolf howl among the pack. But I'll try to answer.
Here's my plan. I'm building a bridge. I stand here now in 2019 on uncertain ground. I need more sure footing from here to the distance of my day of death. I don't know when I'll die so I'll just pick a goalpost for the sake of starting my plan. Let's assume I live to 90. Working backwards, I'm funding the last year of my life by saving in bitcoin now. Then, I'll work and save to fund my 2nd to last year of life via bitcoin, and so on. Each year funded is another, new wooden plank extending my bridge closer to me in the here and now.
As time goes forward, my location on the timeline  is bringing me closer to my bridge that's simutaneously extending towards me. Also, as bitcoin keeps appreciating in value, those wooden boards already in place are expanding, further advancing my bridge to me that much sooner. 
I'm hoping in 5 - 10 years my financial bridge of retirement and security will be under my feet. Spending the rest of my life walking that bridge then to my final day on Earth is the symbolism of my family being worry-free of work and money. Each bridge board stepped on is some bitcoin spent as money along the way.
Yes, I am a hodler of last resort.

You asked the wrong question.
What you do is hodl the bitcoin and max out the payment plan's length. Then, while your bitcoin appreciates, only sell as much as necessary each month to make the payment. When vitcoin moons, pay the remainder. This way, in the end, you paid a fraction of the same bitcoin wealth you started with.

I got BTC every two weeks faithfully throughout the year. I saw gains in the 1st half of the year and then losses in the 2nd half of the year. But my net sum is gains at the end of the year.

The money owed to me was $6,560. If I accepted payment in fiat, I would have received $6,560. One year later, that money would still be $6,560 today.
But I took payment in bitcoin. So in December 2018 I received, not $6,560 dollars, but $6,560 worth of bitcoin, which at that time was about 1.89 BTC. You can see that if you scan the QR code.
One year later, 1.89 BTC is not worth $6,560, but (at this moment) $13,573.42. One more year from now I anticipate this money will be worth $100k.

I am in a profession with recruiters always asking me to leave one company to work for another. One day last year, I started asking for bitcoin.
**Recruiter**: *Hi! Are you considering a new opportuniy?*
**Me**: *I will if you could pay me with bitcoin instead of dollars.*
**Recruiter**: *No, sorry. We only pay with dollars.*
**Me**: *Okay. At this time, I'm only interested to sell my labor for bitcoin. Bye.*
That is the conversation I had over and over whenever another recruiter would solicit me again. Then, finally, someone that wanted me to work elsewhere badly enough said okay to my terms.
So, again, just keep asking. Tell them you'd rather not sell your labor in exchange for fiat anymore.

The privacy soft fork puts every hodler at risk. Which side of the fork will stay mainstream? A lot of progress has been allowed because the blockchain has been a public ledger. 
For example, Japan has made BTC an official currency but also outlaws privacy coins like Monero. The New York based online exchange Gemini especially strives to please government regulators. Maybe they'll refuse their customers that follow the privacy fork. 
I want privacy but wonder if I have to stay on the current implementation so as to not watch my wallet's value fall like when BCH people forked away.

I get paid every two weeks and I've repeatedly seen the following after each payday:
1. Price chops sideways.
2. A surge upward and my *two week* paycheck looks like a two month payout.
3. My paycheck is suddenly half the man it used to be.
But I just keep dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) and, at the end of the year, I'm up thousands of dollars. 
Yes, I accepted risk that fiat earners don't experience. But I kept faith in the *bitcoin truth* that, regardless of volatility, in the long run bitcoin is going up. Conversely, I also stayed on this path because of the *dollar truth* that, despite its non-volatility, in the long run the dollar is going down.

You are correct but I don't occassionally buy it and time when to sell it.

I earned it in January and spent *some* of it to pay my February fiat bills. I hodled the rest.
I earned it in February and spent *some* of it to pay my March fiat bills. I hodled the rest.
And so on. So I did sell some bitcoin in July and I made gains doing so with the cheaper bitcoin I earned in June.

Are Lightning questions eligible here? I can't find one place that explains this clearly.
1. If open a channel, must I first spend money so I have empty space in my channel before I can receive money?
2. Can I open a channel in anticipation of receiving money without loading any money? How high can I set that receiving limit? If people have to load their channel to open a channel, and you can't send money to a channel topped off, how can anyone start sending to anyone else?
3. Why open multiple channels? When is one channel too few?
4. Everyone says keep keys in cold storage because hot wallets are more vulnerable but Lightning only works on a full node that is essentially always hot, right?
5. I want my business invoices remitted via Lightning, not just Bitcoin, but that's not practical because Lightning doesn't bridge well as a fiat off ramp, right? Because I'm asking the payer to pay their channel-opening and channel-closing bitcoin fee to pay my lightning channel, right?
6. Lightning is really for people that only transact continuously in bitcoin, right? So, people that need to move back and forth to fiat should not concern themselves so much with Lightning, correct?

Another aspect of how I've enjoyed earning bitcoin instead of buying bitcoin with fiat earned is that I am out from under the State's surveillance system. I'm no criminal. This money is for legitimate corporate work, but I value the principal of privacy.
@_date: 2019-02-08 03:37:22
I switched to bitcoin in anticipation of this. My entire salary is in bitcoin so I don't need a bank account to get paid. I keep my savings on the blockchain.
Unfortunately, I haven't yet persuaded all my billers to accept bitcoin so I still use the bank to mail fiat cheques. Hopefully, crisises like this will help move those creditors along with their own crypto adoption.

Earning bitcoin is better than buying bitcoin with dollars earned. 
This way, I remove the bank as a dependency to get paid and my financial affairs are more of a private matter between me and my source(s) of income. I still sell bitcoin to pay taxes but neither the bank nor the govt know how much bitcoin I have.
When you buy your bitcoin from a KYC exchange, you're under State surveillance. I'm more of a ghost to them.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:53:46
Right. Instead of a company paying their people in fiat and each individual opens their own KYC account to buy crypto, let the company open that one exchange account to pay their people in crypto. Then, the State surveillance system only has direct visibility into the company's affairs and not all the people.

You are speculating but I am the real deal. 
All year, I've been getting paid every two weeks *only* with bitcoin. To be IRS compliant, I've tracked every gain and loss; every taxable event. The year is almost over and my detailed records show that I'll be reporting thousands of dollars in gains. 
Note - this isn't to say I've *timed* my trades better than others. I never buy bitcoin and I don't choose my payday dates. Regardless of price action, I get paid on schedule every two weeks. Because bitcoin is all I earn, it's the only money I have, so I am always selling just enough bitcoin each month to pay my fiat bills.
I am speaking from the authoritative platform of **direct experience**, not just conjecture like everyone else. If your employer paid you the same annual income this 2019 but via bitcoin instead of dollars, then you'd have still received your same, entire income **plus thousands more in gains**.

You and I are failing to communicate and I don't understand the significance of your last remark. 
I have a Ledger Nano S, using segwit for my wallet. I can see and spend that wallet's money by cable-tethering my Nano S to my phone for MyCelium or to my laptop for Electrum and also Ledger Live. 
So, I have three separate programs telling me what's happened in that wallet's history. Electrum and Ledger Live are in agreement about the transaction history and about the current balance. MyCelium is reporting differently, and now MyCelium is not letting me move that 0.096 BTC it alone claims I still have.

I'm looking at MyCelium, Electrum, and Ledger Live. All three are showing me the transaction history "of the same wallet".

I work alongside H1B foreigners from India doing the same job except they're only making $3X per hour. And my American colleagues doing the same job for only $60 per hour.
Why the inequality? Because everyone is getting paid only as much as they're allowing the employer to get away with. It's the same everywhere. People aren't paid based on fairness and equity. If the employer could, they'd have everyone accept minimum wage. We each consent to our own individual compensation and the employer capitulates only as much as necessary for the business.
So, my point is if you want more, you have to take it. Don't wait for someone else to decide they think they should make less so you can have more. That's a hard thing to expect of someone. Be ready to walk to get that better rate.

My bitcoin I've earned is secure in my wallet. When my employer needs to pay me again, they buy from an exchange however much bitcoin they  need to pay me again.

When I look up the MyCelium app in Google's Play Store, it shows me the Open button. Not the Install button. I installed this almost 2 years ago, I think. I haven't had issues before. Either I didn't notice I was bleeding satoshis before or an auto upgrade has allowed a good app gone bad to enter my phone. 
Since MyCelium is reporting a higher balance than my other apps, I just tried to forward the entire balance on MyCelium to a new receiving address of my same wallet. I get the error response "No scriptcode for com.mrd.bitlib.model.ScriptInput". The transaction fails. I can't use MyCelium to send all my money it claims I have back to myself.
I know I just said don't anybody trust MyCelium to do another transaction but I have my Ledger Nano S tethered to my phone and I took great care this time to confirm what my Ledger said it's signing off on. I didn't look so carefully with the previous transaction that seems to have stole some of my money.

Why does only MyCelium now report a higher post-transaction balance? I'm looking at the same wallet in Electrum and Ledger Live. They both agree on the same "lower" current balance. Both Electrum and Ledger Live subtracted both outputs and that why they're reporting a new, lower balance. MyCelium is the app that conducted this transaction and it's not subtracting (or admitting to me) the 2nd output. If only one app was not confused about what just happened, it should be the application that conducted the transaction. Right?

Every payday, I convert approximately 25% into fiat for taxes so as to not risk a big BTC price drop and then not having the dollars needed to pay my taxes. 
I also approximate the total cost of all of this month's bills and sell enough BTC to pay those bills. Meanwhile, I keep looking for alternative businesses that will let me pay their bill with crypto instead of fiat. I hope to eventually bring the percentage of fiat based bills down to zero, or as close to zero as possible. 
After taking care of taxes and bills, the remainder of every paycheck is hodled. 
Where I can/do spend bitcoin instead of dollars, I keep a journal of the transactions to stay compliant with the government's mandate about reporting gains. I just mailed in my income tax paperwork to the IRS including form 8949 which is for crypto compliance. 
There are three types of employment status in the USA. FTE, W-2, and 1099. With FTE and W2, your taxes are withheld by your employer on your behalf. These employment terms can use BitWage to get paid in BTC. With 1099, you are fully responsible for withholding and paying your own taxes which is what I prefer. Finding an employer that agreed to let me work under 1099 terms was also part of my new job search when looking for BTC based compensation.

I listened to Andreas Antonopoulos describe the privacy update as a soft fork that would happen in 2019.
Individuals will want to follow the privacy wallet but I anticipate the institutional wallets will stay on the public ledger. If the whales don't migrate to the privacy fork, maybe most everyone else will not either because most everyone wants to hodl the "real" bitcoin. Meaning, the one that's going to the moon. 
I want everyone to come with me to the privacy fork but I'm trying to accumulate BTC as a retirement plan. I don't want to see my savings become irrelevant like the other bitcoin forks. 
I want to be grateful for bitcoin going private but I'm quite apprehensive about how this is going to impact every hodler. We always hear the Bitcoin Standard author say there's just Bitcoin and everything else is a shit coin. I wonder which side of this privacy fork he'll keep his money on.

I know this will sound like a scam but I'll send bitcoin to your wallet if you deposit fiat into my bank account. 
I earn bitcoin so I have no dollars but I continually need dollars to keep paying all my fiat bills. The online exchanges do money conversion for a fee. I'd rather not pay the fee to get dollars and neither would you to get crypto. If we trade peer to peer, we can agree to zero fee for both of us so I'll sell you bitcoin at spot price.
Like I said, my paychecks are bitcoin based so this would hopefully not just be a one time trade. I'm looking to start ongoing relationships where you'll keep coming back for more. We can start small so as to let me earn your trust. DM me if you want to give it a go.

I didn't try your advice but I think it would have worked. 
I was already in the middle of downloading Ledger Live for Android. I connected my Nano S to my phone and tried importing my wallet. What it did next was unexpected. 
It listed two wallets found. It gave one of them a default name of "Bitcoin 1". This showed the same balance desktop Electrum and desktop Ledger Live reports. But then it also showed a 2nd wallet and named it "Bitcoin 1 (legacy)". This had my lost money. 
When telling Ledger Live on Android I wanted to send money, it asked me to pick one of these two balances. I chose the one labeled legacy and forwarded that money to another address of the same wallet, having my Electrum desktop receive it. I'm currently waiting to see the 1st confirmation. I think everything is going to be okay now. 
Thank you u/brendzy for helping. Even though what I just did without your help may still be recovering my $500, I appreciate your advice likely being another solution to help me get control of that money again. You can DM me a receiving address and I'll forward $200 to you so you understand my gratitude is sincere.

I do not know of such a list. 
If you are FTE or W2, using BitWage doesn't mean you're asking your employer to support bitcoin. You can ask HR to redirect a certain amount of your pay to another bank account. They have no idea who/what this other recipient is. They only know you approved forwarding your money there. It could be back pay to the IRS. It could be child support to your ex-wife. It could be to your BitWage account. Only BitWage knows they're using your fiat to pay you in crypto. 
If you sell your labor as 1099, the employer's "compliance" is of no concern. They're still going to report to the IRS how much they paid you each year the same way, still describing the value in terms of dollars. The paperwork they submit doesn't have an extra check mark asking "Did you pay this person with dollars or bitcoin?" Whether you earn $50,000 worth  of value annually in fiat, crypto, or bananas, the IRS will only be told you were paid $50,000 worth of value. The IRS will see that none of the banks have any record of you receiving paychecks, yet the online exchanges report you keep selling some crypto for dollars every two weeks. This doesn't tell the IRS how much bitcoin you have. They only know how much you've sold and when. 
This is all legitimate. I'm prepared for a full audit if that ever occurs. I'm playing the crypto game by the government's rules and I expect to pass with flying colors. However, I do enjoy some of the additional financial privacy I've achieved by obscurity from big brother's prying eyes, I admit.

As for Samurai, I tried that wallet and abandoned it, running scared. It was so buggy, I thought I was going to lose my crypto from it.

Your post was too long for me but I reported a bug when I tried this wallet. You can click on the balance to switch between bitcoin and satoshi units.

Neither of us know what's really happening but we've jumped to different conclusions.
I think the government has strong-armed these exchanges to spy on our fellow man...or else. The exchanges may not want to assist in sovereign theft but figure it's either them or the customer. So, F the occasional customer served on the government altar and stem the story as much as possible to not frighten the other sheep.
They may be trying to put a lid on this (including yourself) not only because it's bad for business when people learn not to trust the exchange but also because the real criminals in public office insist on secret courts or no day in court at all. Just take the victim's money and tell the exchange personnel to keep their lips zipped unless they want to be victimized next. 
Just like this victim you're demonizing, I too am not a criminal but I can imagine getting cheated next, trying to get the Paul Revere warning bell out on Reddit, and tools like you trying to silence me and cast doubt in everyone's mind who's really the bad guy here. 
We heard it from the Exchange; they're sorry this is happening and sorry they can't explain why. If I was running an Exchange and the government goons threatened to cage me for exposing their theft, this may be all I say also.

That's almost correct. You can have up to two pincodes on a Ledger, one per wallet. But you can have many, many, many passphrase-protected wallets. For all those additional wallets, you don't have the pincode shortcut to access them. You have to type in the passphrase every time to enter those wallets.

I was thinking along the same lines. 
I got one bitcoin for each child. I'm thinking of trusting the mnemonic seed to a 3rd party, the same kind that waits to read the Will after death. But the default wallet is empty. Each coin is behind it's own passphrase that the inheriting child alone will know. This protects the money from the 3rd party stealing funds but the 3rd party makes them HODL as long as possible.

As simple as your alternative explanation is, I didn't consider it. Duh. 
I like this app - 
Remember though, after watching an address and you spend even a little satoshi that's taken from there, the app will then report a zero balance. You may think you've been robbed but that's just because the transaction remainder you didn't spend went a a new, different change address.

u/dalebewan I was a gas station attendant while trying to study software engineering in college. I had other peon gigs too  during that time whereby my hourly rate was floating between $7 - $11 per hour.
When I finished school, I agreed to $40k because I didn't know what I was worth. But then I learned the game. Every year, I'd ask for a raise and, if I didn't get it, I'd take a new job elsewhere and get it. I was averaging $10k increments year after year. 
u/meow0369 is right, though. I don't earn $100k. I'm past $200k now. The OP isn't the only maximalist. I've negotiated my current gig to always pay me entirely in bitcoin. I only sell enough crypto each payday to cover my taxes and to pay those bills whereby the biller still only accepts fiat. 
Here's more on my claim - 
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:24:03
I've been banned from a large bank too. No justification. When I shared my story, people like u/castorfromtheva made the same accusations that there must be more to the story. 
Whereas I can't explain why I was banned, I did meet a crypto ATM vendor who said he's had his bank accounts closed a dozen times and how he keeps looking for a new, next bank to open an account at. He says his problem is that he's in a cash business and his stream of hand carried deposits and withdrawals spooks the surveillance-compliant banks.
I'm a bitcoin maximalist now and the banks made me do it. I've already found a new job that agreed to pay my six figure income entirely in bitcoin. So now I don't need the bank to receive my paychecks. I'm currently working towards replacing all my bills with alternatives that accept bitcoin for payment. Then I won't need the banks to mail out cheques anymore either. That's when I'll finally fully divorce myself from the fiat institutions.

Okay, so I have bitcoin. I dare you to unleash the full force of your mighty mouse (and keyboard) and make an example out of me. I dare you. I'm begging you on the world stage to teach me this lesson. 
Truth is, since moving out of fiat and into bitcoin, aka be my own bank, I worry far less about theft; monetary theft or identity theft. Sure, it may inconvenience me if I have to make the time to dispute a fraudulent charge and explain I never opened that account in my name, but because I know nobody can get to my bitcoin, I know that everything is going to be okay in the end. I'll always have all of my wealth. No thief, common or sovereign, will take it from me.

Curious that you mentioned your site but you didn't cite it here. 
Anyhow, we see why most people buy the spike and sell the dip. They want "assurance" about something's value before they act on it. 
When BTC was $19,000, yes we heard them all say they wish they had a second chance to buy in at $4,000, but they only said that because the $19,000 price "assured" them that $4,000 was a good deal. When it fell to $4,000, they were no longer "assured" of its upward value. 
Now, the price is jumping up again and they're starting to perceive "assurance" that $4,000 was a good price, if only they could get another chance to buy in back then. But now we know what they're going to do if price tanks again. They'll lose that sense of "assurance" to follow through. 
So, we can now conclude that "dumb retail money" is not an unfair smear. It's a real phenomenon that represents the majority of people who will always keep the markets oscillating. As long as we allow them free will to do as they please with their own money, they can't be helped. We can only choose for ourselves to not also be the fearful, emotional buyer that buys the spike and sells the dip.

@_date: 2019-05-19 14:28:30
Someone from Moon said something interesting to me in another post's comment discussion. I expressed concern if they're helping the IRS know when we're spending bitcoin so that the IRS can give us a hard time when they see we didn't report it in our tax returns. The Moon rep said they'll comply with a warrant (like how the IRS served Coinbase a couple of years back) but that even then they may have a warrant canary in their plugin to signal us all. 
But the IRS is asking the online exchanges to only report people that have gone over $20,000 in trades within the year (sales of BTC actually, I think). If true, then it may not be worth their time chasing the rest of us down for the little gains we're occasionally realizing when shopping at Amazon with bitcoin.
I know the whole report-gains compliance burden is overwhelming for people, even flat out confusing and they won't comply simply because they don't know how to. I've been thinking about posting a YouTube video of my own, showing everyone how to do this so it's no longer a worry for anyone.

I've already made the switch from earning fiat to a bitcoin based salary. Now, trying to replace all my billers with crypto supporters, like a landlord that takes it for rent, a landscaper that will mow my lawn for it, et cetera. 
However, while I earn it bi-weekly and spend it on monthly bills, I think we have to get on the Lightning Network bus for daily transactions, else we'll see those $50 miner fees again at the next bull run.

I had to look this up. 
The Amazon Store Card is issued by Synchrony Bank and can be used to purchase items from Amazon.com.The Amazon.com Store Card doesn't expire and does not have an expiration date.
I have not signed up for this. I didn't even know about it. I have other credit cards on file from outside of Amazon. 
But I don't think this changes anything. When you go through checkout, the Amazon workflow requires you to indicate which means of payment known/defined in your Amazon account you'll be using. It will not list Moon or BTC as an option. Even if you intend to pay via lightning BTC, you have to indicate another "on file" option as a technicality to placate the Amazon website. 
After you pay with the moon plugin (shown as a widget inside the Amazon web page), you'll see that the "on file" option you chose to satisfy Amazon's checkout process was not charged a penny.

Yes, I've consider this approach. But the more transactions you make on LN (it always costs 2 BTC fees to open and close a channel), the more worthwhile it seems. 
I don't want LN to buy coffee. I want to pay big bills every month without $50 fees each when bitcoin bullrun's again. That means I need to front load a lot of money into the channel before I'm all out of money and need to reopen a new channel. 
If LN is deemed safe at some point just like the bitcoin layer, why not load all funds, locked up in the 2nd tier, ready for spending?

I left one job for another so that I could have all my paychecks entirely in bitcoin. I haven't earned a dollar for the last year.

I can't remember the names to look up the news story for citation here but I learned of a crime whereby two thieves invaded a family's home in broad daylight. They held the family hostage while ordering the wife to go to the bank and get "all the money" out. She did as she was told, not warning anyone in fear of her family's lives. But still, after she returned with bags of cash, the thieves set the house on fire with the family to all die inside. We know these details because the husband crawled out and survived.
This family didn't say anything about bitcoin. This was before bitcoin. They were just an upper middle class family in a nice neighborhood with a beautiful home. That's why they were targeted. I know about "this one particular family" but if I research this, I expect I'll learn it happens often. 
Keeping bitcoin a secret doesn't make that much sense to me. Every day, we're getting more world adoption. At some point, people will wear it on their sleeves that they have money in bitcoin the same way people don't keep secret they have dollars. 
I concede people shouldn't tell everyone exactly how wealthy they are just like they don't with dollars. People celebrating their 1 full bitcoin milestone may not be completely realizing this proclamation is just like announcing they have $500,000 cash on them...yet.

So I read your news link above someone hijacking people's SIMs. I understand doing this can help someone fraudulently access accounts that do two factor authentication (2FA). 
But my crypto is never on an exchange. A thief needs physical possession of my hardware wallet and then has just three chances to guess my pincode which is somewhere between 0 - 99,999,999, or else it erases itself. 
Yes, they could instead use my mnemonic seed as a workaround but I've already memorized it and destroyed the written copy. 
Persuading me with a wrench to divulge it doesn't help if it's a multi-sig wallet and I've already explained to the other key holder in advance not to cooperate with me if I signal them during communication with a secret code word that everything I'm asking them to do for me is under cohersion and duress.

I think you meant to type"bought". I get this question a lot. 
When I get paid in crypto, I take away the bank's power over me. I don't have to explain myself when I make large deposits. I don't have to ask for special permission when making large withdrawals. I don't have to worry about being told my account has been closed because the bank hasn't heard from me for a long time. If the IRS or another powerful entity decides I owe them money, they can't just tell the bank to give it to them. Everyone must ask for my consent and cooperation to get my money now. No going quietly behind my back and seizing it. 
When you have only bitcoin and no dollars, your burden is to sell bitcoin so you can pay your fiat based bills. When this happens, you learn to be more frugal and you'll see your accumulation happen more quickly than when deciding repeatedly to buy bitcoin with leftover money after paying bills and doing other things with dollars. 
There are many benefits to switching from a dollar based job to a bitcoin based one instead.

Remember, it watches only a specific address. Not the entire wallet's contents. 
Also remember, when you move some money out of a given address, the remainder doesn't stay there so don't expect this address-watching app to show you a lower balance.

I'm glad you asked. I always sell at spot price; no premium or fee. 
Usually, people do sell for higher than market rate to make a profit because, if they didn't do that, why bother trading. 
But my circumstance is different. I don't buy bitcoin, I earn it. It represents 100% of every paycheck from my work. I have not earned a dollar for a long time now. 
My bills are still in fiat though. So every month I have to sell enough bitcoin to pay my fiat-based bills. So I'm constantly in need of people that want to buy bitcoin that don't earn it themselves.
I can sell at the exchange (and I do when I don't find enough buyers in a given month). You can buy at the exchange also. But we both pay a fee to the exchange whether we're buying or selling. If we trade directly, we both save on no fees (except the miner fee, and I'll shoulder that). 
This is why I don't charge higher than market rate. When trading peer-to-peer, I'm already saving if I sell at fair market price. I want to incentivize people to choose me over an ATM or Exchange so you save too if you trade with me. 
If you want to trade just once, that's fine but my hope with every new relationship is that you'll keep coming back to me for further trades. Why go anywhere else when I'm always here with a non-stop inflow of bitcoin for you at spot price?

2. In an interview with Boxmining YouTube channel, he argued that even if his dick is eaten, he can outsource the job to some prostitute, he said.

I remember when Peter Schiff disputed the notion of gold price being volatile. He said the gold supply is steady and the dollar supply is not. So then, if you analyze the price of the dollar relative to the steady gold price, you see it's the fiat that's erratic.

I've taken large sums of "my" money out of the bank before and got questioned by the gustapo behind the counter. But last year when I tried to make a large deposit, the bank had me standing there holding up the line for 20 minutes while they made phone calls to report it. "What are you doing with this?" they asked. "I'm trying to pay taxes to the IRS!" I said. Finally, they said I am permitted to leave?!
I walked out of that branch office that day, determined to adopt crypto so I can eventually sever the banks out of my life.

I don't remember where I read it, but I recall someone saying Moon uses Coinbase for conversion. Not sure about that. 
Like I said in the post, the Amazon invoice shows your order's entire balance is paid by "gift card" as another clue how Moon is orchestrating this behind the curtain.

I think this may be against their terms of service and puts our funds and account at risk.

I have a CoolWallet S I don't use anymore if you want that hardware wallet.

I have an Eclair question. 
The app says it's backing up my channels to my Google Drive account. But I'm exploring Google Drive and I don't see any files other than my own other stuff. 
How can I verify backups are happening?

This was what people said they heard when the web was new and they asked for the internet to be explained.

Here are my predictions:
2013 - majority of hodlers lose everything because they left their keys on the Mt Gox exchange. 
2019 - a majority of hodlers lose everything because they left their keys on the Coinbase exchange. 
Here's the twist the next time around. Whereas Mt Gox was robbed by illegal theft, Coinbase will be robbed by sovereign theft. The dollar will crash and the US will reinstate US Executive Order 6102, outlawing possession of gold (and this time crypto too). The warrant issued to Exchanges to surrender all customers' wallets will be done "in the name of the public good and national security".
And when this happens, everyone will act surprised.

Maybe this is already answered and I'm not finding it in the comments. 
Why does Moon say the first thing after installing the plugin will be to create an account? So, even if paying with Lightning, not a Coinbase account, we still have to create an account with Moon? Does that mean always logging into the plugin before using it? Is Moon tracking our identity then to sell our purchasing data? Or is it to tell the IRS every time we spent BTC and didn't report it?

This is being posted repeatedly but nobody is also mentioning what else he's saying about bitcoin to his millions of followers. 






You see, he has spooked his followers also with FUD.

u/binarytree how do we get refunded if we begin that process over an order submitted to Amazon through Moon using lightning BTC? Or is every order not paid via credit card at risk?

I'm glad to see you support the Brave browser. Not sure what that 3rd browser is. I didn't want to have to return to Chrome to use Moon.

Yeah, this was put together by people from the old school of money. They don't understand the next generation always inherits the world after them and today's youth chooses bitcoin over gold. 
Bitcoin wasn't represented well and the viewing audience didn't receive the better education why to choose bitcoin.

Why is the price a range? The site doesn't say the dimensions either. Little info given but you're asking everyone to send crypto and trust you'll mail it from .....Russia?
@_date: 2018-12-27 18:37:21
Yes, possible. Maybe only after getting into bitcoin do I notice it when shown. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:03:23
Governments already came together and made laws that forced people to use their own invention of money, called fiat. Everyone thinks it sucks. But if you like regulation, you should stay with fiat. Crypto is everyone else's exit option back to free market liberty.

You seem to be on a mission to spread FUD. 
In case your ignorance is genuine, I'll explain the following to you to help your education. 
Currently, a bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 smaller units. A satoshi is a fraction of a cent, for now. At some point, bitcoin will be the new world reserve currency and a satoshi will be worth more than a cent. Then, there will be a need to have a smaller unit of purchasing power than 0.00000001 BTC. 
When that day comes, bitcoin will be updated to support more than eight zeros to the right of the decimal. Unlike printing more fiat which steals wealth and savings from people holding fiat, allowing a bitcoin to be further sub-divided into smaller units let's hodlers keep their purchasing power while at the same time making the 21 million BTC supply limit more distributable. 
If your criticism is sincere skepticism and not just a Statist trolling this liberty movement, then ask more learning questions instead of spreading disinformation.

Just keep your place in line and wait your turn. The next bus will be coming along.

Nobody loses on bitcoin. Bad timing just means you have to wait for the next bus taking everyone to the land of gains.

I made a donation to this man approximately a year ago to a wallet Andreas Antonopoulos setup for him. He emptied it before my donation. I've been watching that wallet's balance since my donation. He's never come back to it. I guess he's still on the beach somewhere living the dream.

It is disinformation to cite Mt Gox as an example of how getting into bitcoin means risking loss. People that don't know bitcoin yet need to understand the importance of not outsourcing the custody of their own keys.
