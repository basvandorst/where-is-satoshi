Andreas thanks for coming up with this idea. I feel for Dorian Nakamoto and journalists shouldn't be allowed to be able to access personal information at the level they did to promote/relaunch Newsweek. Private information about citizens and their families should stay private, there has been a lot of noise regarding NSA/GCHQ and the way they invade people's privacy, I'm personally horrified by this but have to say after reading the Newsweek article I feel the same way and hope that there could be something done to what journalists can and cannot publish about citizens who are not public figures and also the "databases" they are able to access to retrieve this information from. Journalists are not "law enforcement" or part of a government agency and hope restrictions on what type of information they have access to could be restricted by law in the near future. I support journalism made for the sake of humanity as the Snowden Leaks and the work WikiLeaks has done and keeps doing but what they did to Dorian Nakamoto is unacceptable and hope they get sanctioned for doing that and they actually compensate the man for the damage they have caused. Again there should be laws in place to protect all citizens from this sort of journalism and to protect private and personal information to be retrieved by any news organisation.

Glad it was useful! ;-)

This is great news, from Bali to Guernsey and now Dominica! Good progress for a system with such a small market cap... Not for long I guess. Let's hope more counties embrace bitcoin and the technology behind it.

What is Factom? 
Use case: checkout all of Omniwallet transactions hashed by Factom in a single hash on the blockchain:

Interesting, but how easy it is to use?

It doesn't only hash documents it also keeps track of changes in these documents.
With Factom is really possible to build safer and more secure record keeping on a truly global scale. There are three types of proof that allow Factom to do that:
Proof of Existence: a document existed in this form at a certain time.
Proof of Process: a document existed and is linked to this new updated document.
Proof of Audit: an updated document can be verified to have changed according to a set of rules.

Mmmh you got me curious now... Got a onename already so that makes it even easier to pay someone! Thanks for your reply!

I agree with CanaryInTheMine, I have been following Storj since they came out with the idea. Instead of making comments like that do have a look at their github repository and see for yourself how much work is going on. You sound impatient more than actually making any sense. Good software takes time to develop!

Interesting project, looking forward to DriveShare. And you guys did well with the crowdsale. All the best!

I agree, this is why bitcoin and crypto currencies are bound to become the favourite mean of transferring money internationally and, of course, to make transactions between private citizens. The burden of paperwork and checks that someone has to go through as per your experience is way to eccessive. But there is also the need for digital currencies to become easier and more intuitive to use before everyone can actually be confident enough to pay with them. Thanks for sharing this.

Thanks for all the info.

This is no secret, if you follow Storj you will be on their forum as that's where everything is discussed, the place for the community. I can feel your only spreading FUD because you have a vested interest. Storj is one of the most open and transparent projects I've seen. This is nonsense. They even have it advertised in big letters on the top right of storjtalk.

I have been following storj for a while now and it is one of the most open, transparent and interesting projects for 2015. Decentralized cloud storage that allows for more privacy and security is something I could definitely use.
