Gotta remember the only places its really cost effective to mine in bulk are places with easy cheap renewable energy sources like China's Hydroelectric, Solar in the Desert, or Iceland's Geothermal. The Carbon Clock for bitcoin is only an issue for those who mine recreationally. In the future bitcoin is going to explode in Europe. Because its a way to reclaim unused energy, [In Germany]( They've had short periods where supply exceeded demand on the energy networks. Bitcoin is a way to do something with the unused energy and produce dollars without much of any "human efforts" involved.

Dude, a marriage is a partnership. Not a screw you I'm the one holding more straws. Communication is what makes things succeed. If you're not willing to wake up early, cook her breakfast and talk about each of your goals in life and find a middle ground then you're gonna have a bad time. Relationships are about compromise and men and women are weak in our own ways, but thats why we get married. So that by talking about and sharing our weaknesses we can work to our strengths.

3 issues where i'll jump on you here, and I do apologize for it. 
1) Hashfast in the original TOS agreed to refund customers back IN FULL ("refund the payment") (on the receipt it says I paid in BTC) 
2) they then changed the TOS (in december I believe) to stipulate "Hashfast will provide a refund for the units" and are now telling us the new TOS applies to an order I placed months ago. All this Months later after falsely telling us shipping was on schedule 2x. 
3) The original BTC address that was paid to, has over 30,000 btc in it, as far as I can tell it hasn't been exchanged out for any form of fiat. Meaning they more than have adequate resources to provide a refund.
I'm mad over the factor that if the price of bitcoin fell thats my problem, however when someone else makes a profit off of funds I paid them, then doesn't deliver a product, and tells me I can have back a fraction of what I originally invested. Its sort of like saying, I entrusted my 10 acre estate to a bank to manage, while I went away for a few years, while I was away then they found gold on my property, and thusly told me I could have 1 of the original 10 acres I had entrusted them with back. Thats not what I agreed to when I entered the agreement, and yes i'd gladly take my 1 acre back over nothing, but, if you said you'd give it all back, I want it all back. 
Edit: This was the address with 30k bitcoins... which have since been moved...

Theres huge issues here that you've missed. Bitcoin will never be a common place currency. Very similar to the reasons why you can't walk into a restaurant and pay with a gold brick. Bitcoin takes way too long to transact and the units are way too small to be of common place use. Nobody is gonna say "its .00025 bitcoin for your coffee today sir." Bitcoin will be a commodity based on its structure, much like gold or stocks. Even something with a few fixes in place like Litecoin has a better shot because of faster block times, and more total units. Bitcoin was a perfect starting point, because starting a brand new conceptual currency with more than 21 million units would be foolish, however with the growing popularity of crypto other crypto's will be better suited to become transactional currencies while bitcoin will remain a store of value. This doesn't disenfranchise bitcoin, but the future of everyone trading bitcoin day in day out on the street for goods and services will never happen. We're in the wild west of crypto right now. Yes you can buy a glass of water with the gold nugget you just dug up, but does that mean its the best use of your btc, well thats for you to decide.

@_date: 2017-01-22 02:32:28
I mean the truth of the matter, is this. Bitcoin will NEVER be a widely accepted standard of active monetary exchange. It's like a bar of gold. Everyone knows what gold is, everyone knows how valuablegold is when they see it, but do they always have scales and the needed tools to exchange gold for goods everywhere. No. 
The fact of the matter is BTC is very much the same, does everyone have an hour to wait around for the Blockchain to confirm the transaction. No. 
BUT, a number of institutions accept gold for other forms of currency across the world, and Gold does hold its value. Bitcoin is the exact same way. Bitcoin will never be a form of currency. It just isn't built to function that way (at least currently), HOWEVER bitcoin does have a grand future as a highly traded and sought after commodity. In the days of the goldrush out west, many settlers chose to settle bar tabs with golden nuggets. That's the same principal of where we are today. Many bars and restaurants, accept bitcoin, however, when my investment portfolio has the option of trading in and out of bitcoin, that's when we'll know bitcoin has become a widely adopted currency. That's when the real fun begins...

Personally, I feel like Crypto is Gold 2.0. It's easy to store, easy to transfer and relatively easy to change back into cash. You don't need to pay to have it stored securely in a vault somewhere, and whether you have .50 or 50 million dollars worth nobody knows the difference. However, I'll also say, I think we're looking at the age of the .com bubble where people create .com companies and people invest when they have little to no likely future moving forward. Should be interesting to see how this all plays out, at what point are we trading quarters for arcade tokens.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:13:58
Yeah, I think thats overtly ambitious, I definitely think bitcoin could reach 1/4 the market cap of gold though... 1/2 because bitcoin only has 42% of crypto market dominance, 1/2 because bitcoin doesn't have the industrial uses that gold does, bitcoin and cash for that matter are like beanie babies, they have value because people want them or don't. Gold will always have at least some level of demand because of the industrial purposes creating a demand as a second market.

For the time being, I don't think there's such a thing as too late or too early. Bitcoin will in all likelihood continue to go up. If its tomorrow, next week or next month (or longer). If you can invest money and be OK with setting it aside as a long term investment. Bitcoin in all likelihood will be your best preforming asset. I won't make any promises. Bitcoin is a risky asset class, just like any individualized stock, however history has proven that the sky is the limit (or the moon). Nobody can predict the future, but if I had more money to invest I would still be buying bitcoin.

The issue becomes, companies are so leveraged up with debt at the moment that most don't have the kind of wiggle room to squeeze by when we enter into the next recession to keep themselves afloat. When your profit margin starts shrinking (as things have been as of lately with the worry of recession. Automotive markets are the first to show signs) it becomes harder to make ends meet. Insert the right push off the ledge, and suddenly major corporations are defaulting on their debt. Debt they used to buy back shares, that suddenly normal people can't afford anymore because they've been laid off. Less circulation of cash means less demand for products means companies are in worse and worse shape...

Well, heres why I think so many people call bitcoin a scam... Bitcoins do look like a ponzie scheme where nobody's driving the car, people invest money buying coins. Coins prices are dependent on how many people have invested and how much they have invested. If more people invest than **your** bitcoins are worth more... So you could withdraw the money and drop down the price of their shares... Thusly "walking away with their money" Sounds quite a bit like a ponzie scheme... But what people don't realize is that all money is quite like a ponzie scheme in that sense and that while bitcoins fluctuate, thats how all money works, the value of it, is intrinsically based off of how much people believe in it and at the moment money is trust... It just shows how bitcoins could be worth 10x-100x the amount, people BELIEVE in bitcoins... Enough to invest hundreds of millions of dollars.

I think the point he's trying to make is that...
Bitcoins trade at 10 dollars , 10 people use them , 10 bitcoins in existance - total market size - 100 dollars.
Miners mine 5 coins...
Bitcoins trade at 6.66 dollars, 10 people use them, 15 bitcoins in existance - total market size 100 dollars.
Because your dividing the total cost of whats in existence by the total number of shares of the currency or money.... If you don't have people pay to invest, then the overall cost per share falls...

What you've just said is so silly that it barely warrents this response... Economics is a fine game of supply and demand... and instantiating a currency is like trying to sell your child... they might be a good person, but who wants to feed take care of and watch a kid? its the same way in the bitcoin economy... unless the entire community thinks bitcoins are worth x dollars someone will withdraw the money when another person puts it in, so goes the game of supply and demand.... Nobody invested in bitcoins is just going to throw a couple hundred million in to watch everyone panic when bitcoins go up suddenly to 200 ea and then dump them... droppin the value back down and losing their initial investment... this is why people say "Hold" on your bitcoins it'll intrensically force the prices up, but unless everyone holds their coins including thousands of miners who are investing millions of dollars and hoping to recouperate their investment, the best bet is attracting new members to the currency who hope to own their own share, the more popular bitcoins are and the more people who want them, the less there are to go around, and the more the price goes up... 
the reason they were previously worth 266 is because people kept investing driving the prices up, hoping to ride the bitcoin wave all the way to the top, if i put more money in i'll get more money out, but for the same number of people who profit, an equal number suffer...

Yeah, I was like... whats the payout... when it popped up on the screen he had 1000 coins, I was like Nope... milibitcoins maybe, but full coins for walking around without ad's... not gonna happen... 
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:53:36
Options 8 and 9 are just plain stupid... :P 
@_date: 2013-06-17 01:15:57
with excessive heat damage probably....
@_date: 2013-06-02 02:54:55
I might be interested, but I'd also be interested in hearing if somebody has access to anyone who can build/ship a circuit board for them... I know chips are definitely more cost effective than BFL's crazy 200% price hikes, but I don't have the skills/resources to build a board... (also they said likely 100 days from date of purchase)

How broken is broken... I'm an IT guy, we can talk if its just lost in the laptop as opposed to Lost lost...

Alright, no guarantee's i'll probably hit what you want back for it, but never know until all the cards are on the table... Keep me posted on how it goes... :)

Hi friend :P lol jk

Everyone you say? :P

So theoretically could you use coinlock as a "paperwallet"? someone pays cash for a btc adress?
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:27:01
Not really, because someone needed to buy the bitcoins in the first place to use them... or mine them at the value someone else is paying for them.... at the moment there are lots of bitcoins being released on the market from miners, but there is also alot of new people hoping to get their hands on a bitcoin themselves... so long as the number of people interested are growing faster than the number of bitcoins we ensure that the market continues its upwards trend...
@_date: 2013-06-21 04:57:15
Thats implying that I don't already live in a data center... :P
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:36:04
I'd buy this... Probably more cost effective than Oil...

Do you promise to deliver before a year is up?
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:25:49
Yes, however your title is misleading, it makes it sound if the miners themselves are adding value to the market just by mining... As if the action of producing more coins, intrinsically makes a coin worth just as much as all the previous coins... I just wanted to make it clear that saying that "New BTC Added Per Year = $172,044,191" is drawing a connection between two things that are definitely correlated, but do not cause each other... Correlation doesn't prove causation.

Wait, free electricity at dorm housing? and you can now pay in bitcoin, why am I not going there again? right... Caffiene free mt dew....

Buy 25-ish shares of AsicMiner and cycle the rest through buying and selling off exchanges... tip half of the AsicMiner profits that i make in the hopes of driving more people into using bitcoins (afterall its only a good longterm investment)
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:05:40
Easily? were still talking about substantial margins depending on the power used... most 400gh asic miners will still be making profit at 1,000,000,000 difficulty, but nothing like they will make now... at a billion difficulty a 400gh machiene will still be making 16 dollars per day... after electricity costs... While they might not break even at this value (if difficulty continued to endlessly increase), they're definitely still profitable...

How does someone ensure that an order is completed in a timely maner? How does one ensure someone else is not attempting to complete the order at the same time?
@_date: 2013-08-26 04:49:32
have issues with how your calculating your data sets... (you can clearly tell which ones under and over aprox from the trend lines distance from the last point you should weight more recent data more heavily... personally my own data crunching was giving back aprox mid 650's but depending on hashfast and KNC they could completely change the market..
@_date: 2013-08-12 19:54:44
Well thats still like 13 million in 2ish weeks... If we just literally add up the numbers rather than percents... Worst case timeframe 10 weeks till the end of October timeframe... x 13 million increases every 1.5 weeks thats already 86 million in default difficulty increase alone... add the original value theres 137, plus all the avalon chips in customs and continuation to ship your already at 175ish.... Change that to a percent value, and your already several feet underwater on a sinking ship...
@_date: 2013-10-08 12:21:28
Seriously, tell me this... Whats the point of having a commodity that holds bitcoins off the market in a trust for the explicit purpose of defining share prices? Share prices have the purpose of having dividends, but this trust will not have such a thing because the company is not making anything, if it does pay off dividends the volume of the trust goes down.... What possible purpose could buying shares of this serve, that buying bitcoins themselves could not? 
I'll be honest, I could be unbiasedly wrong... I haven't done my research, but i'd love to hear anyone who knows more about it...
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:44:18
Wheres ? 
@_date: 2013-10-10 01:22:21
Thats $600 for every person in China who works in a sweat shop, thats $600 for every person in india who doesn't have internet access.... your numbers are so far off it isn't funny... EVERY PERSON... for a 6 year old in africa thats $600... bitcoin isn't going to become a standard fiat currency, it has a much longer and lasting use as a commodity like gold... that retains value but is held by the select few... 
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:47:17
I don't know... Pie and bitcoin sound pretty awesome... 
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:08:08
Well, if you have a desktop (or some spare pc parts), you could unplug the keyboard and monitor (from the desktop) and see if you could plug them into the laptop... Worse case so long as the harddrive spins up, you could always pop it into another laptop and boot it up saving the necessary files to a flash drive... If you want more info or have other questions feel free to ask, looked back at the forum and you said it clicks... Is this the computer or the Harddrive itself... usually clicks can be related to fan's catching, or if its the harddrive you might be out of luck, unless the price keeps increasing, if the harddrive is dead usually you can send it out for aprox $1000 to be reassembled in a clean room, but its usually more trouble than its worth... hopefully its the fan :) 
@_date: 2013-06-04 03:50:52
theres always a chance of getting dicked, but at least theres something to say about attempting to protect your ass....
@_date: 2013-09-04 15:28:56
This I agree with, however if its purchased in a fiat currency... theres a difference, however I agree it might be more profitable at this point to purchase the commodity than the miner....

Sorry, was looking on the surface and saw that you could set payout amounts in USD thought you could pay in them as well... My bad...
@_date: 2013-08-27 04:08:52
probably a scam....

Not sure if I really explained all my thoughts fully... but it was at least a shot in the dark... if you have any more questions dont hesitate to mesage me...

How does something like this happen? And how can you prevent it? I don't transfer coins much, so was kinda shocked... 
@_date: 2013-10-10 04:11:07
but thats assuming people are willing to invest 100's of dollars in lesser and lesser fractions of bitcoins... theres a reason gold isn't worth millions of dollars per pound, because it isn't worth that much to people... one of the main driving forces behind gold is the dream of owning an ingot... In the same way maybe some day people will dream of owning a whole bitcoin... However will people ever dream of owning .001 bitcoin I strongly doubt it... 
@_date: 2013-06-19 05:06:32
If I had the cash, I'd gladly toss this in my college dorm room.... free power FTW :D
@_date: 2013-09-04 14:53:56
Exactly... with an investment biased on a commodity... the price of said commodity could increase... Such that, with bitcoins worth $300 the machines will easily pay for themselves, let alone the 1000 they might someday be worth.... (I don't expect that to happen anytime before I'm long retired and I'm 21) 
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:29:09
Yep, i was just wondering how if the cycles repeated themselves what next year might look like, i know markets do change, especially with the emergence of asic's but trends are always good data to look at in the long haul...
