Yeah fuck me for wanting to pay the actual msrp and not $1400 for a video card for my pc build.  Amirite?

See that is where you fail at reading comprehension.  I said I can wait because I can. I just bought a house and we are in the demo stage of remodeling.  I won’t be buying anything until after we build the room for my home office/home theater.  So it will be likely that I’ll be in Volta buying territory by then.  I’m not really planning anything for likely after June.

Yeah no. I’m not building till later in the summer anyway so hopefully BTC will die out even more so that gpu prices are more normalized by then.

Don’t be mad little fella.  BTC may get back to 19k someday.  You just have to believe. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:07:56
You are the problem.   Even though you get bulk pricing the rest of us that want just one card can’t.

Those monitors where announced last March.  Will they ever see the light of day?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:41:55
Yup. You are big mad.  Defend your heathen BTC Influenced mining ways.  I’m ok with it as I won’t be paying over retail for the gpu anyway.

U big mad or little mad?  Scalpers have a market.  That market is miners.  Else gamers would be able to get msrp prices.

How long until GPU prices normalize after the current fallout?
