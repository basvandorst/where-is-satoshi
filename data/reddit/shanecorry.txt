Never going to happen. It's too much work for the average user to start going off downloading things and placing buy orders and looking at charts and the like.
One of the core reasons Coinbase is so far ahead with the average-consumer is because they've taken away a lot of the pain points from an exchange; Simple UI, Simple buy/sell process with Fiat and importantly card buys, Good (or better than competition) mobile apps.
To have a fighting chance against Coinbase a decentralized exchange will need a Good UI, Non-"pro" interface (Coinbase vs. GDAX), Fiat, Card buys + Decent support would put them ahead of the competition.

Can relate to that because I'm actually having some issues with CB atm and their support hasn't been all to helpful but for giving generic answers over the phone but at a time when CB is pushing to expand their support, doing lots of hiring, adding a 200-person call-center staff if you look to the Robinhood subreddit some of their latest top posts have been talking about them having poor support and it is being claimed that Robinhood actually dropped their call support option a couple of weeks ago.
We'll just have to see how they handle things, hopefully they've seen the support problems other exchanges are having and have been wise enough to hire &amp; train a lot of support / verification staff in advance of launching to preempt any problems. Good or bad, competition is always a good thing.

They need to clarify if whether they make the actual trade on an exchange that does charge trade fees, whether the user buys / sells at a rate that includes the fee or if they pay at a rate that excludes the fee and Robinhood either covers that fee / has negotiated it away / doesn't use any exchanges that charge fees.

I meant more like if they used exchanges that have 0% maker fees and then always set very close to market but not market price orders that should fill very quickly, not optimal though because they could end up with a rate difference at times if the crypto suddenly drops hard which would be like a fee in of itself but possible if say they didn't process their user's order / guarantee a rate until the order on the exchange is successful.

You have to go through a secondary 2 IDs + proof-of-address verification process if you want to withdraw your funds to an external wallet though.

$100K minimum and you're buying USDT rather than having USD itself available.

BitPay settle it for you into Fiat for a fee, I think it's 1%, which is fairly high for cryptocurrency but not too much for the typical merchant when Card settlement &amp; PayPal take 2-3%+.

Bitfinex supports margin trading so they actually need 25.75M to place that 85M order but still a lot!

No, lighting is not ready for use / adoption by general consumers and it won't be for a while yet.

Every 1st world country has KYC/AML regulation.. The exchanges that don't follow their country's procedures are just operating within the grey area that cryptocurrency exchanges do not fall within one of the industries that  are specifically stated to require KYC. (Usually banks, financial operators, forex, bureau de changes, money transmitters etc.)
Poloniex are owned by Circle now and while they are mainly a US company, they also have companies in both the UK &amp; Ireland, just those countries have the same or arguably more-strict KYC regulations.

It's exactly that they're smaller that it would take less time, Coinbase is always talking of security of users and making sure to test new features extensively, they also likely need to do some UI/UX trialing because some non-savvy users could easily be confused by the changes otherwise.

You mean the market movements that cause massive active user / web traffic surges which then result in downtime? Not everything has to be a conspiracy.. It is entirely possible that the reason exchanges go down is purely because a ton of users suddenly want to buy or sell at the same time and not because they're trying to scam their users.

By that logic pretty much every asset ever is always in the bull market..
S&amp;P500 drops 90%? Hey look we're up 200% since 1980 so it's a bull market

But in order to code / implement it they would have to give the product team (devs, designers, qa etc.) the heads up they are planning to implement it, so those could trade before the announcement anyway if you wait until the implementation breaking the whole logic of them announcing it as soon as they decide to add it.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:59:52
Howso? I don't see how this can really be prevented any moreso than what they did already (Tell employees not to trade BCH or they could lose their jobs etc.)
The reality is that:
* 1) A lot of employees would need to know it is coming, Developers / QA / Designers to actually implement the addition, support staff to be trained in any new questions related to the addition, Finance people to set up any auditing / financial proceedures.
* 2) Crypto is close to anonymous, anyone can use a different fiat gateway / a non-Coinbase exchange to buy the BCH, there's no way other than giving a stern warning (that would deter some people) that they can actually prevent anyone from buying the currency, with stock exchanges they'd manage with possibly finding out from taxes / KYC on exchanges but this can all be avoided with crypto so there's no good way for them to track down offenders.

They will be adding it back soon, they recently bought the Poloniex exchange (for a rumoured price of $400M) so they're clearly still interested in crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:53:53
They had already said they would be adding BCH in and around the date they did though.. Annoucing an exact date a month out is never a good idea, complications can always arise and then if the date was pushed back the price would plummet and people would be again complaining of losing out.

Robinhood fills orders using existing exchanges so you'll likely be getting a GDAX rate / paying GDAX fees anyhow when using them and their withdrawals will require additional ID verification and take "up to a week"..

Has been banned on Reddit for at least a year but they do allow ads from crypto services just not ads for cryptos themselves or ads on how to buy / sell them.

Like 2 years ago, definitely not new.

What do you think of the recently-announced, Coinbase Commerce?
Seems to be all very similar to your product, you've likely got a one-up on supporting more currencies and having a better website but they've got the better-known brand, launch marketing and direct Shopify integration (without a plugin / downloading addon from store).
Both look a lot better than CoinPayments anyway which afaik is very similar too but both support a lot less currencies.

Standard SEPA payments are already regulated that it has to be next business day but that's still a matter of waiting 3 days if you transfer on a Friday and no payments being processed on public/bank holidays. Also the times the receiving banks credit a transfer vary wildly, some may credit a SEPA at 1 minute past midnight as being the next day, others may be 10am or 3pm the next day.
SEPA instant credit transfer must be within 10 seconds so they're going for card level of speed and the huge benefit to crypto here is being able to buy quickly without using a card means much lower fees for doing so because the reason exchanges charge 4\-10&amp; fees for card purchases is because of chargebacks and processor fees.

Without knowing why their account was disabled, there's little point throwing out wild speculation.Given Coinbase take a fee, there has to be a reason, I doubt they just did it for the hell of it.

**This is why EU residents should be very excited for SEPA Instant Credit Transfers** which have now been introduced as a new standard in the EU \(only supported by a few banks thus far, all banks must support it by the cut\-off date\) which introduces the ability to send a payment within the SEPA zone that has to take less than 10 seconds from being sent to being received and credited to the payee account \(and they must be processed 24/7 not just during weekdays from 9\-5\). Also banks aren't allowed to charge high fees for the ability to make one of these payments.
This can have really good implications on crypto too. Imagine buying crypto near\-instantly with a bank transfer instead of a card, it will allow exchanges to offer fiat buys that are as quick as a card but much cheaper \(As they don't need to worry about scammers doing card chargebacks or having to use a card acquirer / processor that takes 3\-5&amp; fees per transaction\). Selling crypto too and being able to have the Euro in your account within a minute would be a massive improvement on the current 1\-2 business days.

It was something like "This profile is restricted, please confirm you want to view this profile?" if you tried to go to the profile page. You could still view it but only after pressing a button saying you wanted to continue.

They also don't allow payments to / from exchanges or for crypto\-purposes, I got my old account blocked after withdrawing directly from Coinbase to it.

Looks like there was a short squeeze.
[One Bitmex trader had a $7M position liquidated..]( even with potential leverage that's a big position. Shows shorts were probably getting too optimistic on the future outlook.
Another potentially good way to predict the future is to look at the order books on Fiat exchanges. On Coinbase for example, there would need to be \~$10M sold at market for the price to fall \~$300 whereas $10M bought would result in a \~$1900 price gain so clearly the selling order books are very thin.

[ is another good one, I've started to prefer Trading View though, I like their UI better.
