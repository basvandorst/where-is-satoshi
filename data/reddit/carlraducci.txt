Not necessarily mate, you can use any of the secured wallets like Kraken , blockchain and some others before going to the ATM. On purchasing, you are require to scan your barcode from your wallet on your smart device. You know it’s really not advisable to purchase for hodling now. Why not mine with us? That way you don’t get to loose even with the fall in price of bitcoin.

Trading is a good start (kraken, coinmama and LBC are reputable sites) but mining is more profitable and the dip doesn’t affect on the blockchain network.
