You can check out for more info.
From their FAQ:
The bot scans user comments and messages for tips of the form "+$1" and then sends the specified amount of bitcoins from the sender's bitcointip account, to the receiver's bitcointip account.
Basically bitcointip runs accounts that track bitcoin transactions through the bot A Bit Coin Tip is just that, a monetary reward for something given through bitcoins. You don't need a bitcoin wallet to receive a tip, but you will need one if you want to use your bitcoins for anything other than tipping other Redditors.
In order to make a tip you have to pay bitcoins into your bitcointip account.

That's complete bullshit. A million is obviously a ton of money, its just no longer "I'm done doing anything ever and can do whatever" money.

I just don't understand how to get started in all this. I've tried looking at the different markets for buying bitcoins and it all seems so sketchy with my bank information. What's the best way to dip my toes?

Like through the bitcointip bot? Does the other side have to accept the transaction?
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:42:37
woah, I've got a ton of reading up to do now.

When did you start mining? Have you since stopped?
