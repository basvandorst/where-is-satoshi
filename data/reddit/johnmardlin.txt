Hey, Coinbase support here. 
That's not possible, because each bitcoin address corresponds to a [private key]( and keeping a private key secret is the essence of security in bitcoin. 
A bitcoin address belonging to your Coinbase wallet cannot be transferred to another wallet. It's actually generally advised to give out a unique bitcoin address for each payment you receive. In your Coinbase account you can see all of your previous bitcoin addresses here:

There are a lot of reasons a deposit might not be credited automatically.

Coinbase doesn't pass your banking information to 3rd party applications. If an app is able to buy/sell, it is handled on our end.

Hey, I work for Coinbase support, and can explain:
Basically, we take the fees in such a way that the order is equal to whichever you specified.  
Here it is in the words of one of our devs, when we recently updated how our fees are handled. 






- when you enter a BTC amount to buy, you know how many bitcoins you’re going to receive.
The rest of the difference, (ie. total coming to $1,000.24), was likely due to price movement.
We used to have a lot of confusion from people who were trying to make their daily maximum purchase, this has cleared that up. 
Thanks for the great questions, I'll make sure to get this into our [FAQs](

We launched Canada on [August 31st, 2015](blog.coinbase.com/2015/08/31/coinbase-expands-to-canada/). 
Vogogo is the payment processor that facilitates transfers for us in Canada.
That "limits increased" email is interesting to see there. It refers to your buy/sell limits, which are zero until you add a payment method. 
I agree, if a customer is leaving because we don't make it clear that we can help them, that's not good for anyone. I wish I had a better sense of the source of confusion here. Is it likely you accessed Coinbase through a proxy that would have made you appear to be in a [country outside of our supported regions](

You had me confused for a moment when I went to check again. It must have been the xchange.js package. 
I guess the other thing that I think would be useful is more currency pairs, based on actual exchange activity.

Regarding this statement:


That simply not true. A good indication of this is our ongoing discussion, both internally and with the bitcoin community, about what killer apps are needed to move bitcoin forward.
Otherwise, the argument about whether being able to easily convert bitcoin to fiat at the point of sale is bound to end up being circular. We think it's good for bitcoin, and that's why we're doing it, others may disagree.

Good question. The short answer is that it would be a very bad business practice to withdraw money from your account without your permission, and we'd rather have you as a repeat customer, since we're in it for the long term here.  If you're worried about the security of using your login credentials to connect your bank account to Coinbase, you can also choose "Other Bank" (not matter what bank it is), and we'll send some very small deposits to your account, then ask you to identify them in order verify that we've got the right account. We also have some really serious [security]( going on.

It's definitely true that we're busy and sometimes slow to respond, but this does sound like it might have been a bit overzealous.  We found what looks to be your case, and we'll be in touch shortly to straighten this out.

I'm on the Coinbase support team, and I can tell you that cancellations aren't something we're ever happy about doing. You spent time building up trust in our system, and we paid you back with a bad experience. That's obviously not our goal.
I don't know the particulars of your case, and even if I did, I probably couldn't talk about them in detail. That's the tricky thing; the vast majority of our users are well meaning, but some of them are trying to rip us off and in order to protect ourselves, we end up making some people angry. Without some automated systems in place to protect ourselves, we couldn't operate at all, and going into detail about cancellations with users would also weaken those systems. 
Feel free to contact me directly, though I can only do as much as any other of my colleagues. I wish I could do more to help.

An issue on our end delayed instant purchases made in the last couple days. It has nothing to do with your track record as a customer (thanks for doing a lot of business with us). Most likely this instant purchase will clear after 5 days, and then the issue will be fixed by the time you make another instant purchase. But feel free to email support if you'd like us to look into it. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:36:56
To be fair, you can still make a purchase. Previously you might have been cut off entirely. That's not happening anymore, and overall we're seeing happier customers.

That's not right. Instant should be instant. I think an issue just popped up today which is causing some delays on instant, but I didn't think it was a 3-5 day delay. I hate to say this, but please email us at support so we can look at the specific transaction.

Hey good question. 
Since you have a USD wallet, you have a couple options. 
1. From the [Buy]( page you'd probably want to use your verified bank account as the payment method. Since you probably a have a balance of $0 in your USD, that won't really be an option for you yet. Note that bank transfers take [4-5 business days]( to complete, but the price will be locked in at the time of purchase. 
2. You can go to your USD wallet and click on 'Deposit' at the top right hand side to fund your wallet. Similar to step 1, this will take a few days, but once the USD is in your USD wallet, you can go the  Buys page and make an instant purchase with those funds.
Lastly, to speed up purchases, you can add a credit card at

Accepting debit cards, wouldn't serve the same purpose of a credit card for precisely the reason that it's exactly the same as money as a bank account. Credit cards are a [back up payment method]( so if an ACH transfer fails, we can charge the credit card. Debit cards might be easier to add than a bank account, I'm not sure, but they won't increase the speed at which we deliver the bitcoin.

No, our merchant tools only payout to hosted wallets. You could use the API to create a transfer from the receiving hosted wallet to a multisig vault whenever you get a payment notification callback, but yeah, that's more work for sure. 
You can also choose a percentage split for the payouts between BTC and USD.

You could use the [/sells endpoint]( with these params: 
    {

        "commit": false,

**Edit:** Some things that I want to clarify;
1. The question seems to imply that we may have seized the customers funds:
  &gt; "(and I was unable to deposit my BTC balance back into my bank account)"
 
 We don't keep people's bitcoins when we close their accounts for breaking our [user agreement]( we just disallow further currency exchange and ask them to move their coins elsewhere. 
2. Although we're trying hard to make account closures less unpleasant, prior notice isn't something we can give.  Once we have deemed that a customer is using our Wallet for prohibited purposes, we can't give them "just a little bit more time" to keep doing those things. I'm sure we're not unique in this behaviour.

OK, I know this will be in your articles somewhere, but... 


That's what I'd expect to see, so spikes and drops probably aren't the time that this provides the most insight. So then, what are the situations, and signs that are the most useful here? Feel free just to link or copy/pasta me to the answer.

The 'TLDR' that I use for the site is basically: "who's more motivated, buyers or sellers"? 
Red means people are willing to sell at the bid price. Green means people are willing to buy at the offered price.
Is that accurate?

No. See the update to my response above.

Only for an order "Maker", mean you enter your order at a price that put's it on the order book. If you are an order "Taker", your order is matched to an already existing order, and you will pay 0.25%.  This [Coinbase Community conversation]( might also be instructive.

We're crossing streams here. I moved the text of this previous deleted comment to the initial request. After this response, I'm going to move further communication to email. 


Unfortunate timing. We would love to have god-mode control over payout timing, but we don't.
