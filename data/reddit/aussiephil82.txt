I still have a German bank account from when I lived there. I wonder if I could cash out into that account then withdraw here with my atm card (slowly).

If I could cash out and buy a house mortgage free then I would probably also do so (sadly I have nowhere near enough bitcoin to do that).
Would I lose out on future gains? Of course. However buying a house can eat up a large percentage of your income in mortgage payments for decades. I'd be on easy street with my income and no mortgage payments and would be happy with that even if it continued to go up (and I'd probably hodl a bit still if I was in the position).

40% here in Australia for me. FML
Meanwhile, recent numbers released show that one third of large companies (including ones like Exxon) again paid NO tax in Australia last year.

Meh. As an Australian, we got there weeks ago.

Investing probably would have killed you if that's true. You would have cashed out when it went up a bit and bought more drugs and shit.

Depends where you are. I'm in Perth and there's no housing bubble here. If anything there is an oversupply.
I bought my apartment in 2009 and would sell it at a loss if I would today, so I always think what a moron I was since calculations pretty much always show that you're better off renting and investing the savings in shares etc. I put about $20k in index funds earlier in the year and made about 8% already, so I'd be way better off now if I did that in 2009 rather than buying property.

I'm wondering if this will be the downfall of bitcoin. 
If it's meant to be used as a currency then how is that feasible when the fees for small transactions are so high?
