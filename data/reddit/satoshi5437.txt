Ok so why is that are they running on renewables? Please explain.
@_date: 2019-01-20 22:09:21
It will but in 3 years
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:44:32
And... back to zero again?
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:27:17
Well that doesn’t say much except this time the Dow moved up 8 days after crypto did..
But with all the records short term I can’t find a correlation still.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:19:41
Are you saying that cryptos are easier to affect and manipulate than other markets? Or is this the same across the board?
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:50:43
Not if there is a global slump like 2008, again it’s still all speculation.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:26:01
I’m not sure if I can believe these figures.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:57:21
Now everyone is on board Bitcoin it will tank in 2019.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:12:37
Yes infact satoshi is actually chirizard which is the highest cost Pokémon card.. it costs 300000 Robux in roblox detour s.
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:57:53
If bitcoin hits 20 k for only a month in 2017,  1 month tells us that the asset itself isn’t infact worth 20k, therefore it won’t return again, the past does not equal the future, period.
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:40:42
I have ledger, no longer buy cryptos because of lost funds.
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:02:56
Children are not allowed to use poker machines, period.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:30:20
Well that’s honest feedback and granted well, cheers.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:04:15
I’m not really sure if I care about what Mr Peterson thinks.

“The power of the mind to self delude is unlimited” (Dick smith) and he’s always been right.
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:02:10
And we keep buying the dip? .. hmmm for how long?
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:23:08
America uses checks, but it’s only the elderly these days.
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:26:02
Been doing that for years, saves on costs, but there would be too much uprising against removing cash altogether, I feel it would be impossible to change the mindset of 45% of people that have an eftpos card, google quote “Nearly half (45 percent) of consumers who own a rewards credit card say they prefer using cash for purchases under $10”
@_date: 2019-01-05 02:50:31
Yes was going to say another Australian lol

Fake Gold chart.
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:28:01
By contrast, People spend a life time trying to discover why things happen financially, many may blame the president of the day for their loss when infact it was just downturn Elliot cycles that just occurred. You can never isolate one thing to a financial gain or loss, it’s just a fact.
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:07:36
Yes but without BTC moving up all other coins will fail regardless 
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:54:32
Not when there is a global recession 
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:12:15
The only way we can be a sinking ship is when we have a major downturn like 2008, some think it will be even bigger than that, I hope not.
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:51:48
Well you deserve it.. lol
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:21:46
Reading all the comments I’ll say, the power of the mind to self delude is unlimited. Peace.

Yeh ok, I used my credit card, so who cares anyway?
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:00:38
lotto is just another way to Tax people with false hope, kind of an evil scheme.
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:29:15
Lol until 5 cents?
@_date: 2019-01-21 08:14:04
Buy hard at 1800? What if it goes to $500?
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:03:32
Well I don’t really know what to think here?
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:13:36
Might be more extreme this time with the Chinese trade war and Trump.. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:05:28
So does it does fiat and BTC 
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:55:49
Ledger itself doesn’t work with windows 7 properly you have to have windows 10,and even beyond this if you have issues with your firewall you can forget receiving your funds.
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:47:45
I’m terribly sorry but you are not making logical sense.
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:02:27

I remember a knowledgeable friend much older than me and good at mathematics said, that “ if you buy a lotto ticket, make sure it’s the cheapest ticket, the odds are pretty much the same if you spend hundreds of dollars”:he’s right, it’s a 1 in 80 million chance of winning power ball.

Interesting, not interested I’m an investor not a gambler.

No it’s just a German thing.

My friend the power of your mind to self delude is unlimited, never forget that, ever.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:42:23
Indeed hope similar to poker machines that destroy thousands of families and lives
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:04:02
And this is why bitcoin will tank in 2019 because the confidence is over
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:25:59
It’s a button that allows you to use renewables 
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:43:43
No only fiat people like Donald Trump are super rich.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:37:02
Yes but if you had a choice to inject funds into a company vs cryptos, this is your decision, to me there is a correlation because it becomes a matter of choice where you invest, and this idea goes with our community as well, it’s like saying will I invest in amazon that never paid a dividend, or bitcoin ? Tough question for sure.
@_date: 2019-01-06 06:50:31
Just like when everyone said bitcoin will hit 100k in December 2018.. lol
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:55:56
I have a friend who bought in 2011 he told me he could now pay off his house in 2017 but he didn’t sell, there seems to be a mental attachment to bitcoin somehow and people will just never let go even if the price is right to sell. It’s like they are looking for nirvana.. 
but where our perception of nirvana is , is entirely up to us.
@_date: 2019-01-10 06:52:20
I also have a friend that bought around that time, he never sold in 2017..idiot
@_date: 2019-01-12 08:23:36
Like all wallets today you will lose all your money guaranteed 
@_date: 2019-01-19 11:13:44
Yep to 30k ;)
@_date: 2019-01-13 09:53:55
The button allows lower wattage to handle solar and wind power electricity, renewables are the future. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:06:35
Actually all money is digital already.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:16:07
Yes I was wondering why it was tanking, the mafia want to stop you somehow, wow, sounds fascinating, maybe write a novel Mr Bond?
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:12:23
Buy in and it will keep going down... enjoy the ride south
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:01:47
Can you think of any commodity that’s gone back to 20k in 10 years?
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:11:45
Or cognitive bias?

@_date: 2019-01-13 09:27:10
Nicely shaped butthole by the way.
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:04:08
Yes money never arrived, I did a test run on a small amount from the exchange, I’ve had tonnes of errors with wallets including toast as well with XRP.. these wallets to me suck and when you leave it on the exchange it’s even more risk.. I’ve only ever traded on an exchange for 15 days for that reason, in and out quickly, don’t trust the block chain what so ever.
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:08:34
Yeh, what a ride down was cool, now 2019 further down even better!
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:48:08
He has very American English for a Japanese guy...
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:01:26
Yes I’ll have to agree, but with that said, Amazon havnt paid a dividend so what’s the difference? I’d rather invest in a company that has yields of at least 6 to 10 percent if I put my house on it.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:25:22
Only accumulate small amounts over time, we are heading for a wild ride down.
@_date: 2019-01-19 08:03:40
Just keep in mind all cryptos can go to zero especially during turbulent times.
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:12:23
Great video, sell it all before you lose everything, then get back to basics and work at McDonald’s for a living, just awesome.

Lol, below does it say for a good gay time call 0475928433?

@_date: 2018-12-30 07:06:52
I can’t work out it’s real value myself, $5? $10?
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:17:10

@_date: 2018-12-12 09:56:31
 Nice
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:43:53
Indeed but what happens after xmas?
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:20:00
Lol, in down times everything goes down.. some just take a little longer.
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:08:41
Well as we know when a recession hits everyone flees and converts to Fiat to pay off their loans so they can feed their children, not much money left to invest when you have to do this, sorry for the awful reality, but it’s the best I can offer during these turbulent times.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:17:25
If it goes down you will be kicking yourself in the balls as well lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:17:35
Buy now and lose another 99%?

@_date: 2018-12-28 06:15:24
The maximum capital loss you can claim each year is only $3000, so if you have lost more than that, it’s bad luck really.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:05:32

@_date: 2018-12-25 10:47:12
I won’t up vote this because no one will ever know where the bottom is, period.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:36:08
Screw those shorties hahahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:43:01
True as well

Keep away from stochastics only look at Elliot waves, we are still in a major downtrend in the Elliot cycle.

@_date: 2018-12-28 06:47:42

@_date: 2018-12-15 20:30:51

@_date: 2018-12-28 06:57:07
Not in Australia.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:37:44
Indeed, agree hehe
@_date: 2018-12-18 11:14:13
Indeed, but we are on earth does that mean it will take 7 years?
@_date: 2018-12-22 21:00:06
Eh maybe.. it’s a global downturn for sure
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:06:14
Activity is better than no activity, just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:48:45

@_date: 2018-12-15 12:14:08
The real second picture actually shows her with a shot gun
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:32:00
I quite like these figures.. just shows incontrovertible logic behind bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:54:30
Yeh, well, all good.. I’m still watching but like most people for the first time fearful I guess.
I guess luck does play an important role as well.. cheers
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:46:11
Yes I do have an understanding, also understand that technology changes overnight as well.
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:27:23
Interesting point, but bitcoin is transferred back to fiat anyway, doesn’t really make sense with this freedom thingy.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:39:31
I’m glad your happy now.
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:25:50
Well it’s hard to say, now people are talking about buying Gold instead, probably because it’s time honoured, just don’t forget crypto can just keep tanking for a very long time..
Who knows what technology will be around in 5 or 10 years? Could it be a new faster crypto? We will see.
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:18:10
Trump is making bitcoin drop sadly
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:07:02
Short fellas will be making some cash for quite some time I’d say.
@_date: 2018-12-04 07:33:41
Because China is running mostly on coal.
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:18:15
I didn’t know banks were a cartel? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:37:36
Yeh it’s true, don’t worry about losses for sure.
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:02:40
Yes I’m 72, will probably be dead when it comes back, he right.
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:09:04
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:11:56
The proclamation that they are using 80% renewables for mining is a complete lie.
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:55:49
It may be fraud, but it certainly isn’t policed in any manner in any case.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:50:07
Well you have concluded my thoughts on the matter, BTC itself isn’t in the pursuit of greater heights because it’s way behind, I’m just hoping they make amendments to its technology to keep up with cryptos like XLM for example.. speed of transactions are paramount but 20 minutes is not acceptable in this day and age.. again I’ll say that I love BTC, I just want it to be the best as Satoshi dreamed it will be.
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:02:05
Yeh still around and it will recover but we are talking December 2019... early recoveries just get dumped.
@_date: 2018-12-26 00:12:06
Yes but if BTC tanks so will all alts..
@_date: 2018-12-26 07:21:18
I would really love to believe it, but Ikea Australia has just reported its first losses here for the first time ever in 2018.. could this be as bad or worse than 2008 downturn?
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:06:26
“Around” doesn’t mean I hold.. but I wish the hodlers good luck.
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:35:41
Feel free to prove it ;)
@_date: 2018-12-22 20:20:33
Please stop talking about Craig, he isn’t the real Satoshi or so my friends tell me anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-31 11:43:03
That’s true but when you have to pay off a loan or 2 some people are forced to sell sadly
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:25:53
Well that explains it..
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:31:02
Stay strong!
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:25:10
Get rid of all debt, buckle up, use self sustainability to survive, use ration packs, buy a tent, sell your car, it’s going to be tough.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:52:55
The report you have is vague and the numbers are inaccurate, most miners go to provinces that have excess energy from coal, renewable sources as we know today are for the most part useless due to the cost of storage, and even your report tells us that the Chinese are losing money installing renewables, I’ll use an example also, last year Germany installed 4% more solar panels and had 3 % less electricity available that year due to the weather not being sufficient .. reports like yours are completely biased and not based on fact because they want an outcome to favour bitcoin as China is the main area for mining. In addition the report is put together by a coin operative company so the 
Outcome will have to be fudged.
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:33:07
That was me that made 1 million!
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:14:43
Cheers for your opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-30 07:01:20
I’ll have to agree, most of my friends keep dumping their hard earned cash into it only for it to drop further like a brick,  not sure why, probably all based on hope I guess
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:50:09
Eh but what happens after Thursday?
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:52:38
It’s on its way to 30k
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:09:32
No that isn’t a conspiracy because China do most of the mining for bitcoin and they are the worst for usage of coal.. a very valid article thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:27:05
Well historically tough years and recessions bring on people selling to fiat because they will need the money to pay their loans, not much extra free cash in recessions to put into investments, that’s my thought on 2019, sorry to be grim but reality is reality.
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:42:51
Sadly it won’t ever go back to 20k.. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:56:36
Sorry won’t get caught holding a red candle, not this time.. I’m out.
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:52:48
It’s a load of garbage, they are taking excess energy from coal mines.. the entire paper is based on theory.
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:02:34
That’s Niagara Falls on the left ;)

A 3 second cut and paste isn’t art to me.. each to their own... and yes I’ve evolved quite well.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:39:48
Many people keep telling me that bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value what so ever, I beg to differ considering the number transactions it does on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:55:44
Not as nice as my Gold Dogecoin and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:58:29
Elliot 3rd wave larger correction coming, it’s now leaning to the right..
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:17:51
That’s because in 42 coins case there are only 42 coins that ever exist.. weird or what?
Makes you wonder what insane fucks develop such a coin in the first place.. it’s all based on superstition apparently, “it's a half-joke based off the novel "The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy", wherein it's stated that number 42 is the answer to the "ultimate question about God, life, the Universe and everything else".. laughable for sure.

I always find that Alt coins lead the way and tell us where bitcoin is headed, as a prime example BCN is at new lows.. BTC will follow like it has with LTC, this will be the biggest tank in history with Trump at the Wheel, enjoy your never ending losses.
