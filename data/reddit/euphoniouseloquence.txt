[Clusterbusters.]( Clusterbusters® is an IRS-approved 501 (c) (3) non-profit research and educational organization dedicated to researching treatments that show promise for reliable, effective and long term relief from cluster and related headaches.
With the apt nickname of "*suicide headaches*", **[cluster headaches]( are the most painful condition that we currently know of**. These are **NOT** migraines as many may think, but an entirely different beast. The few women with children that suffer from them state that they would rather experience child birth without anesthesia than suffer a **SINGLE** headache. They are called cluster headaches because most sufferers are episodic, meaning that when a clusterhead is "in cycle", they are prone to having frequent headaches during that time. It is different for each person, varying from once every other day, to 8 or more headaches in a single day. My brother, a chronic sufferer, was in the ER earlier this year for **3 days straight** of near constant headaches. Almost anything can trigger a headache, the most common being alcohol or other pungent smells. These cycles can last anywhere from a few weeks to months at a time, with a period of remission lasting perhaps a month or more normally occurring in between cycles (though headaches can still occur out of the blue.) 
There are currently no real medical treatments for cluster headaches, and as such doctors scramble to prescribe almost anything and everything that they can think of. Epileptic medications, blood thinners, oxygen tanks, opiates, injections, you name it, it's been tried. Morphine doesn't even touch them.
Some of the **ONLY** truly effective treatments have come in the form of psychedelics, particularly psilocybin mushrooms and LSD. Obviously, many people are hesitant to try these, and more have no way to attempt such treatment. These are currently the only treatments I know of that can not only abort an attack, but can *completely terminate a cycle, or even prevent one from ever occurring*. Clearly, more research needs to be done in this area, but there are many hoops to jump through to get any sort of clinical trials done. Even 2-Bromo-LSD, a *completely inactive and non-psychedelic* derivative of LSD also discovered by Albert Hoffman, costs around **$10,000 to treat 5 people** in a clinical study. 
I am unsure if Bitcoin is currently accepted as a form of donation for Clusterbusters, but I have contacted the founder Bob Wold about adding it as an option. As I stated above, my brother has been a chronic sufferer of the condition since May of this year, and has been episodic for the last ~14 years or so. This issue is very near and dear to my heart, and until you either experience it yourself, or witness a loved one screaming, writhing on the ground in indescribable agony, pounding their head with all their might... there's just no way to truly understand just how horrible and debilitating this condition is.
Thank you for your generosity and consideration, even if you do not end up choosing to donate to this cause.
