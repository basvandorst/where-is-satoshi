Same exact thing here, same email too.  I'm at a different bank so it's probably a coinbase problem.  
Who knows, probably a huge influx of people (like you and me) this week so it might take longer?

Hey Olaf, just wanted to say I appreciate the hard work all you folks are doing at Coinbase.
Also, for some reason the SMS two-level authentication no longer works on my account.  I never receive the actual code to my cell phone via SMS.  It stopped working about a week ago and I have to use the "call me" version to login.

I get the sense that every other post on this subreddit really bothers you.  Maybe you need to step away from reddit for a while and lighten your stress load.

I think you should just give it time...there are only a few transaction options in the market right now.  Bitcoin is still in its infancy and you should expect smarter, easier, and more efficient solutions to emerge in the near future.

IMO you guys are doing great given the demand...keep up the good work!

If you're in the US then probably coinbase or localbitcoin...Coinbase is pretty good once you're all setup.

After years of enjoying the live music archive (and many more features) I finally donated to   This was also my first experience sending bitcoin and it was super easy through Coinbase.

I'm not sure about the EU, sorry...you might want to search the bitcoin subreddit to see what others have said.
