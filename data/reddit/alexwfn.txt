Nothing needs to happen in the Bitcoin chain to deploy lighning network applications just like noting needs to happen on the Internet to set up a new website. 
Right now, what we are waiting is not for the protocol itself (that is ready) but for enduser apps that can let you transact with LN as transparently and securely as possible.
As a user, if you want to help, you can install and try out the apps under development on the bitcoin testnet. It's getting easier to setup everyday. Find a tutorial in 
I have set up a LN node myself and I can open channels on the testnet. If I find bugs or problems, I write on the app's slack channel to help out.
As for regular nodes, you will never be required to run a full node to use LN. You don't need to be a miner either. This is intended to be the protocol that end user apps will implement. 
You can take a look at the current state of the testnet:

I really hope all of you whiners have emptied and closed your coinbase/gdax accounts. Let me remind you that this is first and foremost a market. Use your money to signal for what you want.
Less complaining and more unsuscribing.

Financial pain comes from people leaving. Not whining letters.
Your money is your vote. Use it.

I rather insist on large platforms like coinbase to become less large or disappear. Centralized be centralizing as AA said. 
Don't expect companies to do what you ask. Force them by moving your money elsewhere.
Bitstamp has been using segwit for some time. Stop complaining and just move your business out of Coinbase.

Is there any translation of the parts in chineese?

Thanks for all your answers.
These are exactly what I needed.
