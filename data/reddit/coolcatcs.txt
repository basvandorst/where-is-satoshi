Only a Ponzi scheme if it has no utility 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:37:45
Look at all those coins that aren't relevant anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:26
Governments will fall before the internet. That's what's backing it. The price will change but it will always be around.

I've heard ETH added ring signatures making XMR not so special. Is this true?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:22:01
 I think Blockchain is obviously appealing to libertarians at first and then everyone eventually. It's just too fucking smart.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:01:59
Thank you for the thoughtful answer 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:50:36
Thanks! I will.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:22:13
I was thinking the exact same thing reading this. Government issued cryptocurrencies are oxymoronic 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:17:09
It is truly as simple as that at this point. Find a coin you like and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:04:21
I appreciate that thank you

I think the utility is inherent in the technology which is why it is difficult to understand. Personally, my favorite aspect of it is that I don't have to use a bank and can be in control of my own money. I also know that my money will be around as long as the internet is around. I like that it is a hedge against fiat currency, which I believe is the true Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:37:59
Like I said, noob. But thanks anyway.

Lightning exists
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:45:14
It has over 50% market share right now but monopoly is impossible in competing currencies in the long run. If a certain Blockchain does something better than another than people will use that one. Bitcoin has so much market share because crypto is in its infancy. People don't widely use Blockchain and definitely don't know there are different types. So, at the moment Bitcoin IS crypto because the idea is still so foreign but it won't be like that forever.

Almost every currency has a scaling issue at the moment but it's because excitement is building rapidly and the infrastructure is struggling to keep pace. The currencies that overcome these issues (the ones with strong developers and goals) will be more favored than other coins. The lightning network is something like a layer being added to bitcoin to try and speed up transactions but I truly don't know enough about it to talk in detail. I just know that 2017 definitely instilled some motivation to the developers to scale quickly and efficiently

You don't think miners would take the opportunity to expand their profit margin by reducing electricity cost?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:29:24
It will undoubtedly "crash" but I like to call it a correction. Even if bitcoin falls to $1500 it still would have had an amazing year. There is so much excitement in the space because of the potential of the technology which, in my opinion, is the most important thing since the internet itself.
The electricity is an issue but electricity costs will fall rapidly with the introduction of cheap renewables. 
This is a completely new asset, these cryptocurrencies. It's more of an ecosystem that can do many things and facilitate many transactions. 
Kinda rambling.
Just a big fan of crypto. It's the future!

I did the same fucking thing. I'm such a noob. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:44:52
Damn... that's depressing. It either means we are so so right or so so wrong�� excited to find out 
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:58:15
Peter: "What if it drops to $1000?"
BITCH im buying as much BTC as I can afford then! I'm broke as hell and can barely afford 0.01 BTC. Everyday I wake up I pray for a big crash so I can feel like I got in on this in 2013. There will be ridiculous dips/spikes this is the crypto space. What's more important is the durability and adaptability that BTC has always had. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:19:47
That's beautiful ����

So true man. We need a figure like Neil Tyson in this field to bring the information to the masses in a digestible way
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:55:47
Does anyone foresee any ramifications of a major switch in value between currencies? Less of a switch but a transfer like u were saying? For example, would it be bad if bitcoin dropped dramatically in price way down the road because it wasn't robust enough to withstand the quantum onslaught and then we transfer everything to a coin with better protections? Or is just a freakin party for whoever had that coin to begin with ��
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:59:11
Whoever forecasted a crash at the end of September cost me Bitcoin at $3300 ������ fml
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:34:15
Oh right tf on. I keep trying to find reasons for it not to survive long term but damn these folks think of EVERYTHING

Seriously fuck them. Spent an hour getting my account setup and I can't even make a deposit. Fuckin despicable 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:23:19
Seriously laughing. It's called a long term investment brother. Did u notice that it continuously goes up? Truly not sure if this is sarcastic or not.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:04:36
Crazy how little people know about it. I feel like I understand it fairly well but am still so confused about specific things. Must sound like science fiction to people just learning. Hard to persuade people that it is viable and even harder to get them to spend money on it. I think this is partly the fault of the young infrastructure of crypto. Coinbase did well to simplify the process and make it user friendly. Need more things like that.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:13:26
We are 100% those people. Everyone makes parallels to crypto and the internet. Imagine explaining the internet to someone in 1992. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:54:01
The best advice I've heard so far

Thank you����
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:59:27
I FEEL this. Not just with the gf but everyone I talk to about it. Must have told 15 people to buy during the dip and 0 of them listened. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:08:36
Lol not trying to outsmart just asking questions. Not a secret that the people running this operation are nothing short of geniuses
