THROW THIS BITCH IN JAIL!!  WHERE DID SHE GET HER FUCKING BITCOINS.  SHE'S CLEARLY A GOD DAMN CRIMINAL MONEY FUCKING EXCHANGER!!

DogeCoin would downvote it because they don't want to face the reality that they have no real programmers backing it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:22:28
I don't think it's possible to read it right.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:39:33
You are clearly having an understanding problem.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:36:42
What if my company buys it and holds onto it for 2 seconds and sells them for a slight markup.  
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:04:25
I did not even think of this.  Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:01:31
Methinks you don't know what BattleCoin is.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:27:16
Those are good points.  However, the hash rate of dogecoin is very new and as you'll soon see very transient.   There is a reason it has been crashing and panic has set in.  I don't really see it withstanding battlecoin personally.  That is just opinion though.  Maybe you can keep convincing people that a coin with a dog on it that is a copy of litecoin AND has an unlimited supply is worth all the attention.  Who knows? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:02:17
Here's a link to BattleCoin:
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:52:49
I can't wait until a year from now when you realize you bought into this silliness.
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:24:01
The government already ceded monetarist powers to the federal reserve.   It's the central bankers you have to worry about and just how far they'll push the government and bribe people.
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:07:58
Ahh...so basically the users fucked up with their API keys and now we have articles about how Coinbase was hacked scaring newbies---great job!  Dickheads.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:41:39
It's a clone of LiteCoin dude with a dog on it.  What don't you get...lmfao!
It's not even going to be around in a few months.  Good luck with your scam promotions.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:40:33
Not mad at all.  This is a REAL thing.  It has nothing to do with being mad.  Get ready.  Warn your programmers.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:32:46
At the current rate of decline, DogeCoin will be withered in a matter of weeks.  Who wants an altcoin that doesn't hold it's value and unlimited amounts will be created.  No thanks.  Folks already have fiat.
The programmers behind BattleCoin are NOT copy/clone programmers as are the DogeCoin boys.  You guys better get some real programmers.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:28:45
This thing is going to crush a LOT of alts.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:49:09
You can lead a horse to water.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:27:40
U DUM BRO?
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:22:53
THIS HAS ME SO FUCKING PISSED OFF I'M GOING TO STROKE THE FUCK OUT!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:59:27
Yeah...because this is how we should respond to big money and big banks trying to slow money into bitcoin.  How about some people fight the fuck back with lawsuits.  
It appears to me these fucking money exchanger laws are ILLEGAL AND MONOPOLISTIC AS FUCK!!! 
How are we to fight this bullshit?  Someone go ahead and get the first dumbass snarky reddit point worshipping comment out of the way so we can get to the real fucking  issue quicker.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:37:24
DogeCoin is LiteCoin with just some marketing changes....so yeah.  They'll take on Litecoin and bitcoin too.  Anyone that doesn't have decent programmers will die.
I'll be mining the hell out of BattleCoin.  We've needed this.
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:05:38
The genesis block must be renamed obviously.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:52:08
THROW THIS BITCH IN JAIL WITH THE REST OF THE CRIMINAL SCUM!!  DON'T FUCKING BRO ME!  EITHER WE'RE ALL FUCKING CRIMINALS OR NOT!
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:31:34
If you want to mine, start mining scrypt based coins.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:27:56
It appears to me the dogecoin investors are scared because their coin has been falling off the edge and their volume is steadily going down.  
One of these days they'll wake up and realize that only the reddit community finds it funny.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:34:33
Hey man...this is a warning.  You can use this opportunity to get real programmers.  The current programmers won't be able to handle this.
I'm just telling you this is going to kill you guys if you don't do something about it NOW.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:01:50
Bitcoin has real programmers.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:51:12
We'll see how it responds.  If the developers can thwart the attack then the argument that it's a scamcoin won't hold merit. 
Looks like we're entering a new period where coins have to prove they are not scams to stay alive.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:25:10
Folks it's time to strike back with the justice system ourselves some how.  We can't just passively take this mother fucking shit.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:12:37
Coinbase DID NOT get hacked.  This is simply ridiculous.  You are right though, it's best to buy and then move the bitcoins to your own wallet or a paper wallet.
Basically what happened here in plain terms is someone gave out a form of their password.  That's the plain speak version.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:13:42
You can lead a horse to water.  You better get cracking on telling the world about DogeCoin and the developers about BattleCoin.  Your effort is wasted on me.  DogeCoin is a scam.  I KNOW this.  Your "developers" better go hire some real developers quick like. 
By the way, I know several programming languages javascript being the primary one.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:43:54
Not what I'm saying.  Once again, go read up on BattleCoin.  See what it does and warn your devs.  They'll be active if they are any good.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:24:16
You're right...top open source talent is always drawn to scams.  Give me a break.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:43:05
Are you having comprehension problems?  You may want to read about it.  Good luck.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:09:05
It's just the dumb ass reddit community and their love of memes.  If you go to Ebay and look at currencies...turns out GoldCoin is doing the best.  Go figure.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:23:13
Once again, you guys better get prepared for BattleCoin.  This has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:34:18
Of course they fucking don't.  Our government is a terrorist fucking organization bought and paid for by big banks.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:27:31
I agree with that.  It's just this is not a hack.  This is stupidity with some user.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:20:14
It's not coming back.  Quit kissing their rears.
