While I knew MtGox wasn't allowing cash payouts, they did have trading tools I wanted to use.  I heard that Bitstamp was better and was working on getting authorized so I could convert all cash on MtGox to BTC and transfer it to Bitstamp to resume trading there - aaaaand that's when MtGox was shuttered.
I was just looking for a place to trade and try some trading experiments to see how they'd perform *in the wild*.  They were a partial success and I learned a lot from them.  I had really only been working on the project since mid-December.
So... essentially I was impatient to try out my ideas and MtGox was what I had set-up initially (because of brand awareness).
...and I learned that if I'm going to trade, it could be problematic to let surpluses not needed to conduct the trades sitting on someone else's server where they could be stolen or seized, or any number of bad things... though my own personal wallet is not impervious to those issues either.

...in a world where facts are retarded.
It's totally legit for businesses with internal software engineering competency capable of contributing to OS projects to use it as a means of collaborating - but too often I see it as a quick fix.
If you haven't been on a project where some OS fanboy starts peppering the codebase with components that he's unable and unwilling to support then you haven't seen a lot of codebases.
There's a lot of great OS out there, but there's an endless list of people who've been burned by devs who wrote checks their butts can't cash.
Is that OS's fault? Nope.  It's the fault of shitty devs and idiots who hire them because they claim they can get it done in half the time in half the cost.*

Not a huge deal though. It wasn't a lot and most of it was BTC I mined long ago.

There are any number of causes where the cumulative sume of private contributions exceed the amount contributed by Government sources.

Doesn't have to be BTC based. Forms of payment for premiums and payouts are simply a matter of contract.If someone stole 250k Microsoft Points from your house you can bet your insurance company would replace them (minus deductible).If you hold a lot of any commodity on premises, its a good idea to discuss it with your insurer to clarify coverage in the event of a loss.

Here's a nice example:

Anyone know of a  type site to help novices get set up with various forms of encryption?
I set up one a few years ago [to help people who wanted to secure their email]( It's a little out of date.
It focused on S/MIME which is an extension to MIME for email that offers email security features. The advantage was that it was built in to most email clients. Lately, email clients have been excluding the functionality.  For example, most mobile email clients I've seen can't open S/MIME encrypted emails - or even authenticate signed ones.  Hotmail and Google accounts could both handle S/MIME but you couldn't read them via their web interfaces (it'd only work when these services were used in conjunction with a client).
So for encrypted communications for laypeople I've just been recommending Skype-to-Skype messages and Hushmail.
Seems like people have forsaken a lot of security for convenience.

I spoke with my Dad who has been a Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter (CPCU) for around 30 years and he had an interesting tidbit when I asked him if homeowners and small business coverage would cover Bitcoins.
He said that most policies limit coverage of cash and bullion to $500 in value and that to cover the rest you need special "Money and Securities" coverage.
Even if the coverage can't be applied to Bitcoins with a given insurer, it's still good to know so you can check with your agent if you have a lot of Gold and other hedges against inflation laying around the house.

It is difficult to trust entities. What about people who want me to boycott a company because of the causes they fund?

I think it's interesting that most of the victims of thefts and scams were victimized because they didn't treat Bitcoins as carefully as they would other forms of currency.
So the thieves see it as a prime target to liberate people of value, but the users aren't savvy enough to protect their assets.
You see this a lot in the media too. So many articles act like we need to start from the ground up to make new laws to deal with Bitcoin theft. Simply untrue - but users would be wise to take a step back and treat securing it as they would any other asset.
One good way to start is for these Bitcoin operations to get insurance to protect against hacks, theft, etc.
@_date: 2012-09-04 19:51:21
And some room for insurance. Though affected users may already be covered by electronic fraud protections in their homeowners/renters policies.  I know my policy protects against losses due to companies getting hacked and identity theft.

Obama called his budget "fiscally responsible" even though it's based on running up a shit-ton of debt.
I can see how a nation where that passes muster from the President could get that reputation.

I never see physical manifestations of the vast majority of *dollars* I am paid and spend - that's just a balance too.  Quantitative easing is also *just a balance*.
Sure, I can go to a bank and convert my balance to dollars - but I can do the same by buying dollars with Bitcoins.
It just seems odd to try to differentiate two things with distinctions that are non-distinct.

Are you suggesting that electrons in a given pattern are somehow less *physical* than dots of ink on a piece of paper?

Could it be that there actually isn't any authority to do that?
Ever notice how nobody is too busy to spooge their pre-conceived notions all over Reddit - but when it comes time to actually support them suddenly they get all busy with chores or something?

New York has been very successful with banning black markets in the past...

It doesn't have to be blatantly false to be absurdly biased.
Don't Bitcoins also *derive their value from the ability to exchange them for cash or use them to buy goods.*
It also assumes that being backed by a central bank makes a currency somehow *real* or valid.  The world has known many currencies that were widely used - and not backed by a central bank.

Looks like their large format printer has some banding issues on the left side.

It seems that they're giving rampant regulatory idiocy a pass...

I'd settle for Ohio.

Whatever gave them the idea that they had authority to do that?

It's called a veto. Look up Gary Johnson's two terms as Governor of New Mexico for an example of how it's done.

Can any argument premised on the notion that we should assault or threaten to assault people to achieve our aims really be considered *a useful argument* in any sense other than being useful at demonstrating sociopathic reasoning?
@_date: 2013-08-13 15:20:03
Yeah... [I'm not seeing any specific authorization](
@_date: 2013-08-14 12:45:26
Seems legit.

Never attribute to malice or stupidity what can be attributed to a National Security Letter.

Maybe find a job in the private sector?

Yes... let's ask the guys keeping the company on Windows XP, screaming into the Polycom, and blocking any useful 3rd party apps what technology to use.

Bitcoin is on sale. This happens all of the time in the run-up to the holidays.
