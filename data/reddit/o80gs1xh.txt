Actually, it comes from 75% of the last 1,000 blocks mined must be from XT or XT derivatives before the two-week count down starts (and not before January 11, 2016).

So if and when Core ever does raise the limit, wouldn't it then be an alt-coin by your definition?

It looks like the mods are "trying to teach us a lesson" by not modding anything right now at all. I say use the opportunity to document how you feel.

Purse.io is an indirect buy method. You sign up at the site, verify yourself as much as you like, then click the "Earn" button at the upper left. Find an Amazon wish list that corresponds to the bitcoin price you want (Effective Rate), currency type (right now there are plenty of listings in USD, GBP, Euros, and Japanese Yen -- if you buy in a foreign currency I assume you'll be paying an exchange rate and possibly other fees through your CC [provided it's even possible, as Amazon may not allow purchases at their international sites]), and the approximate amount of BTC that you'd like. Click on the row for the corresponding offer, and click the "Accept Offer" button. Complete the purchase with your Discover card, and the items on the wish list will be sent from Amazon to the Purse.io wish list poster as a gift. Once they receive the shipment, they release escrow on the BTC, and you receive your coins.  
As a new member, Purse.io will restrict the amount you can buy until you "level up".  
e: Looks like the best bitcoin rate available right now would be $330.86 per BTC if you're buying with USD. Better offers may sometimes get posted, but likely get snatched up quickly.

Unfortunately, I know both and thus know you're full of shit.

Let's not forget that the market value of bitcoin over the last two years actually rose from ~$98 to ~$266. It's the massive bubble during this period that makes it possible for a lot of people to still be down. That bubbles are often only clear in hindsight is the nature of free markets. Purchasers/investors should own the consequences of their own buying decisions. If you're in it as an investment and are convinced that you are currently "bagholding" (which I take to mean you believe markets will still move lower), sell now and buy back later when it actually is lower. Just don't forget that timing a market can be just as hard as recognizing you're in a bubble while it's still playing out.  
e: spelling

Pretty sure it's not that, but as I said it's still fairly early so I can't be positive. My XT's been running for a while now, and it's still showing 285,040 K used (37 peers). By this time with Core, it was typical to show 300,000 to 400,000+ K used.

Don't think the moderation mistake is over, though. Posts comparing XT and Core performance are continuing to be deleted.

I'm seeing something similar. In fact I made an earlier post about it that has since been censored:

Except pools consist of individual miners that can vote by switching their hashing power to one with a suitable block size policy.  
I'm choosing to run an XT node to emphasize my support of a workable, coded option which avoids stifling Bitcoin's growth and that will be poised to take effect within a reasonable time frame. I find it a remarkable contrast to the long-running discussions and lack of progress that we've seen on raising the block size limit to date.  
Should a large enough majority of non-mining nodes begin using XT, miners would have to take notice. At that point, they'd have to adopt the change to protect their financial status quo, or risk depressing bitcoin prices (and hence their mining profits) by instigating a conflict as a minority faction obstructing a clear consensus of the Bitcoin community. Faced with such a decision, I'm confident miners would make the practical choice.

I wish you luck, but it's looking pretty definite that igot.com is a scam:  
  
  
As such, the Australia mailing address listed on their site is a P.O. Box, and I'd expect any listed physical addresses will end up at a virtual office company. If you're a victim, your best bet would be to file a claim with the police. You could provide them with this info that I found:  
  
  
I bet the authorities have the ability to go further with the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission.

Did you read the comment chain, or are you just listening to deluded spin? I see nothing wrong with people hosting as many nodes, Core or XT, as they want, as long as they're real nodes and they're getting paid for. There was no mention of forging, so there's nothing Sybil about it.

Anyone could write a hard fork that does anything at all, but the question is how likely is it that the fork would get enough adoption for it to become the eventual longest chain?  
In particular, any effort to restore lost coins via a fork would require a roll back or something similar that would set a precedent highly contrary to the basic nature of Bitcoin: that previously irreversible transactions can in fact be reversed. I, for one, think these ideas would be non-starters for getting any real level of Bitcoin adoption.

So anyone else offering a fork is "hostile". I suppose only Core forks can be neutral or beneficial?
