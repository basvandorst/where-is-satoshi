It's also a safer bet to make -- technologies and ideas rarely die out completely, but a single protocol implementation (even one as widely used as  the Bitcoin protocol) has a smaller likelihood of success.
Essentially, Bitcoin is a subset of the Blockchain technology, so saying the larger set is more likely to succeed is certainly a safer bet for sideline commentators who don't actually have to pick a winning horse at this point.

To be fair, these are two well reasoned arguments against holding Bitcoin as an institutional investor:
1) No historical data as to how Bitcoin as an asset class moves  during down cycles (does it track gold and other safe haven assets, or do something completely different? etc etc)
2) Tax treatment is not very favorable
I don't agree that these are two *good* reasons not to trade/invest in Bitcoin, but they are much better than what most commentators are coming up with (Bitcoin has no inherent value, it's run by math, it's the same as gold, blah blah)

Very true jstolfi, but there are costs to the network even when actual customer losses aren't incurred. When a customer support rep has to process any of those calls/emails about fradulent charges, those wages are incurred by participants on the network (banks + Visa/Mastercard), which are then paid by all participants in the network in terms of higher transaction fees and as unexpected chargebacks against honest merchants.
Of course, Bitcoin may have similar costs for unconfirmed tx's in the future if we don't find elegant ways of solving fraud for unconfirmed tx's.

Agreed. That's part of the the challenge of promoting Bitcoin right now in competition with Visa/Mastercard. Customers being protected up to 60 days by being able to chargeback merchants adds a huge cost to the network (~6% total costs of fees + chargeback costs, it's hard to separate out the actual cost of processing transanctions vs fraud here), but individual customers love the protection. It serves as a de facto network-wide insurance policy that aggregates fraud risk, and causes similar tragedy of the commons / moral hazard problems.
Bitcoin will probably compete with Visa/Mastercard by
1) Driving down average costs for merchants and hence giving lower prices for goods purchased with Bitcoin.
2) Adopting similar strong consumer protections that allow merchant chargebacks of some sort, possibly payment processors like BitPay + Coinbase take on this role.
3) Some combination of the two that maximizes consumer value.
Interaction of Bitcoin innovation and consumer demand on this front will be interesting to see in the next few years.

Success with these fixes only reach numbers like 99.9% for small transanctions, where the incentives for fraud are pretty low. We still certainly need mining and multiple confirmations for large $$ transanctions, says &gt;$100.
These fixes also only work for BitPay and Mycelium because they are choosing their nodes quite carefully. For a new node joining the network, relying on trustless nodes and doing this would make them vulnerable to a Sybil attack, since they could connect to a bunch of malicious, cheap to fire  up Sybil nodes and not know the difference.

Thank you, will update :)

Free GSM access worldwide? I love this. I wonder how much it'll cost them, would love to see more Internet of Things devices adopt that sort of portability.

He's definitely stretching the truth to call the Fed a "protocol" or "computer code", as if every decision it makes can be predetermined by just plugging in unbiased market factors without the distinctly human influence of bank executives, politicians and market sentiment.
However, he does make strong points about what makes a currency useful and why Bitcoin still has questions to answer about how much of the financial pipes it will replace through its utility:
- "Still, he questions whether the bitcoin network will prove to be more cost-effective than other available payment systems, and whether another similar system might ultimately solve the key problems he still sees in its design." -- Very valid question. Can we have the transparency and permissionless innovation of Bitcoin without the costs of mining? There's no first principles reason why the answer is "No".
- "What makes a good currency is its ability to hold its value for very, very short periods of time," -- when BTC is explained to outsiders, even people who accept its security credentials often ask, "But how do you spend something that changes in value so much?". This is an important issue, and the USD losing 90% of its value in 50 years is arguably *less* important than the fact that the cost of a can of soup isn't changing by more than +/- 5% in any given year, making it easy to hold for daily transanctions. Remember, real assets that protect against inflation *do* exist already (real estate, gold, TIPS etc.)
Not hating on Bitcoin here, I'm a huge believer in the future of crypto, but we should be better than the existing financial system in that we innovate and answer in response to criticisms and drawbacks -- that's how Bitcoin wins.

Ok I take it back, if this was on Silicon Valley, people would call it too exaggerated. Can't make this shit up.

Lipstick on a pig. Totally agree, they should fix the real problem, but glossing it over with HR marketing materials ( + high salaries?) is the quicker, short-term solution.

Good god what am I watching. This looks like an episode of Silicon Valley.

This reference gives even more credence to the job posting. The second half of that quote is "And that’s fine. That’s called competition, and we’ll be competing."
It would make complete sense for JPM to hire someone to keep tabs on cryptocurrency and other new technologies so they don't get blindsided by a disruptive new player. If they do find something valuable, are open-minded enough to see that value, and aren't too risk averse to go after it (all big if's), they will build a product around it. Sounds pretty reasonable for a "New Product Development Product Delivery Manager" role.

Looks fantastic and love the focus on usability, too rare in crypto.
One note:
Your team page makes it looks like Aaron Schwartz is on the team. People  will be pissed (one commenter already), you should change the placement / styling.

Some more feedback below. My machine: Macbook Pro Mac OS X 10.9.5 Chrome 40.0.2214.111 (64-bit):
- On certificate page (specific cert. ie. /show/&lt;id&gt;), the "Download Certificate" button under Certificate is not doing anything for me.
- You might want to add a spinning wheel or something larger than the very small progress bar when you click Decrypt.
- Does the "Decrypt" button add any security here? It just needs a click (no password again etc.) and isn't like a visible number someone could peek over my shoulder, so does it add any security?

Haha surprisingly common job for HR people is to convince people who *don't* want to work for a company to come work there anyway. Would argue Microsoft has been fighting this uphill battle for at least the last 5 years.
