Lots of people love the big noses

big if true

Buy buy buy

Buy buy buy

Yes, I was planning on buying some recently but seeing things like this, I'll just wait til it pops again lol.

Because who the fuck wants to use a currency that people treat as a fickle market investment that they need to plan out how much they buy and when. Bitcoin is a joke because of this...

You are exactly why the average person can't get on board with bitcoin lol

Completely missing my point. I don't wake up every morning worrying if my dollar is going to be suddenly worth 10 cents or suddenly worth 5 dollars. No one else does either, nor does anyone want to.

Thank you, I finally understand this now.
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:54:35
Don't worry! Just buy some when it drops back down

Trades crypto? Or stares anxiously at the charts
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:46:22
Thank you for that. I was also wondering how mining played into value.
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:51:07
Both charts start low then go up really fast! They must be the same thing! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:50:06
Exactly my point man
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:10:28
Me either. I was legitimately asking for an explanation and expressing what makes sense to me. People seem to get defensive about it though. The defensiveness over it really screams insecurity to me. Who knows. I would love bitcoin to thrive, it's an amazing idea. But the way it's going right now has me concerned on how long this will last.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:43:02
Exactly. People need to realize that a currency needs to be SPENT to keep it's value. If most of it's owners are holding onto it for investing, then selling it, sure some people will make some serious money, but all in all, this is actually really hurting bitcoins I feel. Now I'm only a 20 year old college student, so I could be completely wrong.

I can't wait for the South Park episode for bitcoin. It has every element to make a good episode.
Something new and cool gets big.
They jump on it.
Curse anyone out who tries to say its risky and might crash. 
All goes south.
