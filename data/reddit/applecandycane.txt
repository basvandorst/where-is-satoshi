A go move is 'bought' by transferring the token to the GoCoin network, thus destroying the token in the process. Tokens earned by contributing processing power can be transferred between wallets, only when the token is spent by requesting a go move calculation will it be destroyed also.
The token supply can inflate and the token spending rate can also increase as computational power increases. The genesis block will provide the first tokens that can be spent for initializing the blockchain.

GoCoin, a digital token that represents one go move against a pro player. The computational network calculates a go response to a (or many) current official game(s) played against pro player(s), i.e. GoCoin vs pro player(s). 
The token awarded to a 'miner' is the percentage of computation contributed, with a fixed time per move of say 10 minutes. The network distributes the calculation of the game tree and positional scores on a peer-to-peer basis. Due to the conditional nature of the computation a stream processing based solution is difficult, meaning CPU's will dominate the computational network.
Tokens could eventually be exchanged for $ via intermediary routes like BTC/GoC or LTC/GoC on altcoin exchanges. Go associations could also buy tokens as a form of funding computer vs pro development.

Glad that she's mentioning bitcoin. Irritated that she doesn't want to do a Google search herself.
@_date: 2014-01-11 11:57:03
There is perhaps a reasonably fast way of validating a work share, simply by checking if the score at a certain high-level game tree node corresponds to the majority score given by the network that calculated to the same tree depth on a given branch.
This requires that duplicate work must be done by the network, which lessens the burden of constant load synchronization, but also lessens computational power.
However, I must agree that it is one of several big issues, and in a proof-of-trust environment this application is not ideal. I do think that it is possible to get a working system though, and I expect to see  at least something for a similar application 10 years down the line.

On another note, the most important thing is that Electrum should be as secure as possible. No leaking of info to other malicious programs etc.
Hearing about a major security flaw a couple of months down the line is going to be really upsetting and will instil a lot of mistrust. That is the last thing I want to find out.

@_date: 2013-07-01 09:31:20
I think one can achieve anonymity by transferring identified bitcoins to high input/output pooled wallets, and using a different payout address. E.g. one can transfer MtGox bitcoins to a new btct.co wallet, buy some shares, transfer shares to another clean btct.co account (as added protection), sell shares (or transfer direct to SR business partner :-P), and pay out to new clean wallet.
Maybe this is not practical for business operations, but for individuals this is an easy way of establishing anonymity. Also mining.

Hedging against the possibility of severe anti-BTC regulation in the US, which can impede USD&lt;-&gt;BTC exchange. Now that it is already impeded on MtGox, such regulation would not affect the price as much as when MtGox USD cashouts were flowing freely.

Wouldn't you have to ensure that you crack the block containing the high transaction fees? For AM being at say 10% of network hash rate, they'd only have a 1 in 10 chance of solving a block, pretty risky, but interesting theory nontheless.

How would you go about making a meaningful profit with 32k BTC in 2 weeks? The sum is too large to do anything standard like flipping stocks or making an interested loan, and betting on USD-BTC is big gamble for a 2 week timeframe...
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:29:04
It's actually shocking to think how insecure the whole design of credit card payment is.
Giving the card number and CVV code to make a purchase **is like giving your wallet address and private key to every vendor and trusting** that they will debit the right amount and most importantly not leak that info to anybody else.
The difference being of course that the origin of the debit operation can be traced and credit card companies can launch an investigation. But, the kind of folk that makes use of stolen credit cards won't be the ones that'll be caught, and credit cards can be used to pay for stuff online, and so tracing those payments will be a dead-end.

Worst case scenario, US bans cryptocurrencies, USD value of BTC crashes, big miners stop mining due to unprofitability, active Bitcoin userbase reduces to a fraction, userbase slowly grows again as we find a way around US restrictions, big miners slowly come in again, network reaches previous penetration high, etc.

It would be far easier to develop remote sensing and intuition to reveal private keys, than it would be to build a quantum computer. Far cheaper too.
Most bitcoin users get access to wallets through a memorized password, and that would be even easier to intuit than a random key.
Then again, for those that have such fine tuned intuitions, there is no need to discover lotto numbers or private keys, for they have most likely found something of far greater value inside themselves.
