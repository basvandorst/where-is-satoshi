Bitcoin isn't 'just another currency'. It's quite unique. I wouldn't worry about the bottom falling out (marginal price per bitcoin) until it has a competitor like it or better.

I was thinking about a simple BTC backed note, but this is better because the redemption is automated and, in a perfect situation, not reliant on a third party to be around to redeem them for you.

The prospect of a 'real use' for bitcoin would send speculation wild.
@_date: 2011-05-27 20:24:03


Yes. And use said taxes to fund GBI for every citizen.
Also, we need a efficient, accurate, transparent inventory apparatus so that natural resource use is charged for on a sliding scale. So, say, the more forest you clear the more it costs to clear more forest after that.  You could also make loops for renewable resources so that, say, you would receive a reward from the funds charged to use (cut down and sell as lumber) those resources if you then went and renewed them. Make it so that the reward for renewal is slightly less than the payment for using the same 'amount' of resources to leave overhead for the inventory system. So, plant more trees than you cut down and you won't pay anything in resource usage.

That's actually exactly what you do. Except it's with a representative of a financial institution holding enough capital to serve your needs. You don't walk in and order a mortgage like a cheeseburger. You have to show that your credit is good, that you have the means to pay, that the collateral (the house you're buying) is in good condition and will fetch the same or similar price later if they need to sell it off, etc. 
Let me put it this way, bitcoin = cash. Bitcoin != entire financial system. The rest of the infrastructure will grow in time given people trust the underlying system enough.
