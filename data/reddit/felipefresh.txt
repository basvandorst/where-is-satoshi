Sorry to hear that! It's definitely a slow grind; I think it'll take time before Bitcoin's volatility issue is solved. I hope you'll still be involved with Bitcoin, even if you don't work in the industry!

That's amazing!

SNAPCARD Wallet (on web and iOS) is definitely my favorite! It's got a super clean interface and you can buy BTC instantly. Especially good for people just getting started with Bitcoin!

SNAPCARD's Wallet is definitely the easiest out there right now. You can buy up to $25 instantly, and you can easily increase that limit to $500 by answering a few verification questions.

While it's true that Bitcoin companies have to be extra careful to protect themselves from fraud, it's also true that the experience could be better for the user.
At SNAPCARD we just enabled buying Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin straight from your wallet. All you need to verify your identity is your name, address and last 4 digits of SSN. No photos or hoops and hurdles.
Hopefully your experience will go much smoother and we'd love to hear feedback :)

The title suggests they'll be comparing the top BTC processors to see which is BEST, yet they only compare two services...
In my experience, SNAPCARD has always been fast, smooth and easy for merchants to use. Lots of businesses here in SF now accept bitcoin with SNAPCARD and it's a great experience every time.
