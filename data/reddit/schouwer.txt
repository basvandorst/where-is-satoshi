Good for you!!! you decided what your 'moon' was and sticked to it. Enjoy your new house, enjoy the stress and fear are gone. Buying a nice house just happens to be our moon as well, and we are going to look at one next weekend. If that means selling our bitcoins and gaining our dream house i couldn't be more happy.

and now we’re back to the first conversation again.

Answer is simple: 
Don’t invest more than you are willing to lose.

Thats sort of what that guy from Holland did. ‘Just because they wanted to live a minimalistic lifestyle.’ And then put all their money in bitcoins.
