Buying bitcoin now would be ill advised. You are several years too late.

I don't even know what that means. If a person creates a post voicing a concern, and gets this label, then I guess label me. I don't care.

Thanks for your reply. It is interesting to see their github. From a quick glance, and based on your reply, it looks like they are doubling down on merchant services before the next bubble.
The wallet play is also interesting. They chose to create an open-source wallet instead of going the coinbase/circle route. I don't really understand how this helps their position, but at least they are contributing software to the community.

Do you have any sources? Coinbase and Circle have both raised money recently, and are continuing to offer new features.

there is already a decentralized github. It is just called 'git'.

Seems like a malicious act by Bitcoiners, trying to protect the one true blockchain.
It is funny to see it here without any recognition of that.

Usually up until about the 6th one

proposing and pushing are not the same thing. they proposed and implemented it, to create a dialog around it, but to say they pushed it is incorrect.

1. A better bitcoin is released, stealing the hash power from bitcoin 1.0
