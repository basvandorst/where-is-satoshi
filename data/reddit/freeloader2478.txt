You guys cry Fud at any bad news but then turn around and pretend like Crypto is a investment.  It’s gambling, plain and simple.  Quit telling the general public it’s a Investment and be honest that it’s gambling and the government won’t have to step in.

You’re so sorry for these people that you want them to purchase crypto currency from rich westerners that has transaction fees higher than there monthly income? ����

Just funny to see a community that consistently has hissy fits at shit like Bitcoin Cash.  Because “it is confusing investors because the name has Bitcoin in it”.  Then gets mad at the government from trying to protect people.  Let’s be honest 90% of crypto projects are absolute scams.  At the end of the day I’d just like to see some consistency.  Not that it’s ok when it’s making you money and bad when it’s loosing you money.

This is such BS you can criticize BTC without getting the develop a better coin yourself speech. Also quit pretending like what core says isn’t what happens to BTC.  The last time someone other than core tried to make changing to consensus you guys got but hurt even thou they changed the name.

Aannnddd UASF didn’t do anything nor was merged into Core.  Don’t know how it’s really relevant here.

Interesting so currently it’s 4-5 seconds if not directly connected.  Do we expect this to grow as LN grows?  Are there any proposals to improve this?

Been here since 2010 and my bitcointalk member number is in the 9XXX range.  I know enough to admit that there is a lot to learn.  But USAF being a circle jerk that accomplished nothing is something I know very well.

LN network doesn’t work without low fees on chain.

He’s not wrong.  Let’s say bitcoin hits 100k, to be a bitcoin millionaire you’d have to invest 51k today to become a millionaire. Far cry from people who bought in at 0.06$.  Not to mention the jump from 5100$/btc to 100k/btc is a huge market jump compared to 0.06$ to 1$.

BIP141 aka segwit2x had 90% of hashtags signaling for it mid 2017.  Core said fuck what the people want and pushed BIP91 which activated segwit on block 477,120.  This is after it failed to activate via BIP9 by having 95% of blocks signalling for it.

But wouldn’t routing complexity increase as the network grows?  It seems right now the network is so small that a lot of people have direct connections to who they are trying to pay.  And if they don’t the wait is 1-6 seconds which seems reasonable.
