He looks like a puppet. I don't know if his demeanor was always like this, I should check out other videos of him being interviewed.

Source? I'm trying to login to Mt. Gox right now and the login button doesn't even work. I just want to delete my account even though it's not verified. 
Never registered from Kickstarter either.

The weird thing is that he was asking for ME to hold on to a transaction.
I'm more curious to figure out what service used my email to phish.

*Duuuude, where's my bitcoinz?!*

I didn't take a screen grab but it was pretty incoherent.
Something along the lines of "Hey, I want to get into bitcoins, but am scared of fraud and scams. I was wondering if you can hold onto some coins through a transaction."

I got this about 1hr ago, haha, who falls for this stuff!


Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week; there has been a heavy load on the servers since the Bitcoin mania has taken over the media. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this: many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.
We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few: the chance to invest in the site! That's right. It is truly a defining moment. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of Reddit. Please do not speak about this on the bitcoin sub-Reddit just yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.
We are offering 300 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excludes running costs &amp; management's share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200'000 per month or $2'400'000 annually. Shares will be priced at $400 for a 0.1% share, paid in BTC (see below) at Mt. Gox's weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.
There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history. To our knowledge, we will be the FIRST company/website/blog to offer shares in Bitcoin.
Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to enable us to make Reddit faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the site where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types. We are done beta testing how the new layout will look.
Pay-outs will by default be paid monthly into a BTC wallet address that you will supply us; the schedule can be changed to weekly and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.
Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 300 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to be made into it.
Payment address - 1K9n6GhReaBWqdBttUYMs3rka9Pj5L8RRd
If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.
Once you have opted into your shares, please reply to this message with 1) Your contact e-mail address 2) The Bitcoin wallet address you have opted in from (by default this will be where payouts are sent)
Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging the Reddit Support here  with your Reddit User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total BTC sent.
Subject - Reddit Investment Op JohDoe [Your User name goes here instead] 4 x 0.1 BTC 14.1024
This is strictly first come, first served. As mentioned before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.
Thank you and good luck!
Steve Co-Founder Reddit
