That's kinda funny. 19k -&gt; 12k was a big crash, what were they expecting?
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:39:24
Man that's just awful, they are even still at the podium.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:54:07
lol a 99% crash. Safe to say they aren't getting in. Maybe pitch them Cardano and see what they say? lol

But it was a bubble... and it *did* burst. We've returned to normal growth.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:18:28
That's assuming the big money doesn't start the price runs.

What the hell are they doing with their cell phones?

My credit union fills out my wire transfer forms for me and I've never had a problem. I just did another medium large transfer last Saturday and it showed up last night (missed that hot sale though).

So that guy that leaked the bcash release 2 days out was what? The Mohammed of crypto?

I just use the desktop site on mobile. It's better than every mobile app by a mile (and better than the mobile site by 7).
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:45:45
Close enough for credit, lot rent for my mobile home.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:26:01
Infuriatingly, yes. I've only got one bill that I pay by check, but it's the only way to pay it. I bet you can figure out which if you think about it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:48:13
The smartest thing you can do if you really want to get in:
Put in an amount you expect to lose.  
When prices rise, sell off an amount equal to your initial investment.  
Play with house money, loss free.  
This is absolutely a pump and dump. BTC will have a major correction, probably (but not definitely) around the time futures go live.

Hey, I randomly stumbled across something that works permanently without any kind of phone mods. Changing  in the browser address bar to w2.reddit.com seems to always get the desktop site. I'm not sure what the significance is though.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:13:25
You do you. Just don't expect much sympathy from the internet if they fuck you without lube. It'll be all "by now you should really know better when it comes to BOFA and Wells"
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:21:06
You missed rods.

I'll give it a try tomorrow. At first glance it doesn't seem too bad.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:00:30
Exactly, people aren't going to act any different here than they have in the past during corrections.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:36:21
How does that compare vs. other post holiday slumps?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:26:35
Does it really matter who is  or  in one of the worst rankings to be listed on?
Don't do business with either.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:04:00
That's been my assessment as well. The only people that would logically be active right now are the active, committed investors and people who just have shit to do with the currency, much like tangible fiat. The situation doesn't reflect on the value of the coin itself.
Things will pick up again when people go back to work.

Most credit unions I know have a network of ATMs they participate in. The better credit unions pay the fees for out of network ATMs.
My question is, even if they didn't, are you withdrawing money often enough to offset all the other fees you're currently paying?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:34:38
The only [one]( I know requires root and chrome.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:09:08
I'm not saying all big Banks are evil. I'm saying that particular one most definitely is evil. The fees are a small potatoes reason to switch though.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:32:13
No, don't do that. That path is rife with misery.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:02:40
Nah, the big boys are playing now. I don't know how long it'll take but it won't be years.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:15:23
And if there ever is, I bet the largest exchanges will be the ones establishing it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:40:11
Either you've got some substantial assets with them (which would be a mistake imo) so they have waived a bunch of fees or you're not paying much attention.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:29:07
So... lucky? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:54:17
In fairness, is any other outcome even possible? Money that doesn't take itself seriously isn't taken seriously. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:29:25
You're adorable. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:24:23
Or lucky. Just because the pool is enormous doesn't mean your brute force won't happen to pick the right key early on. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:26:46
Spending that amount at the time is meaningless. He could have easily bought 10000 more to hold. It's possible to use and invest at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:22
What the hell is wrong with you people?  That goes quintuple for op.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:40:56
If you take the full history it's even more exaggerated. The coin went from less than a dollar to 10k in a little less than a decade.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:47:45
And certainly not the strike through.
