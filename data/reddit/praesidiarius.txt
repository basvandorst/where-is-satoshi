What the heck is wrong with you? BitPay was one of the first payment processors for merchants that supports bitcoin. Both wallets have Bitcoin integrated. Both services brought Bitcoin to millions of people.

So you have wallet ID, and forgot password. What about the 12 word backup phrase? If you have it you can easily restore funds to a new wallet id on blockchain.

There are banks already working on it. Swiss private Bank "Falcon" is managing Bitcoins for some individuals. Also bank frink from lichtenstein is working with local authorities to get a legal process for their customers to buy, store and sell Bitcoin directly with their associated bank account (so no exchange required)

BitPay and Blockchain.com also both work fine, importing paperwallets regularly. Both for android and ios

Yeah both is actually already happening. You are sold and traded on stock exchange (birth certificate) , same applies for refugees. It's a business, as everything is.

It was countrywide before I don't see any improvement regarding Switzerland and bitpay. But it's always nice to see some excitement about Bitcoin payments

Down vote because it's no news they do this since 2015 I think I use it on  a regular basis since more than 1 year.
Works like a charm with both BTC and BCH thanks to BitPay
The news is only they aquired a competitor

how can u say lava is insecure, it will burn you.
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:53:58
well that sounds like a funny challenge. put 0.1 BTC or so on such a wallet and put it on a public minecraft server and see how long it takes :D

I think your better off with sending me 0.5, the 0.5 could break your Wallet. Half coins are broken and can infect others. Maybe in a year all your coins are cut in half then u only have 5.5 left
