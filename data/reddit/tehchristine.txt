I love learning so, why do you consider it new?
My view point is that it is a new form of currency but not a new thing as in a new idea, object, etc.

 First most people have jobs that come with pay checks then they get documents about these paychecks and use them to do their taxes. If they are self employeed then yes they report on their own how much they made. 
 Now you have USD with a paper trail for the IRS and you will be taxed on it. 
 What ever money left over after bills and taxes is discrecionary income. I spend mine on little stuff like a 99 cent book on amazon, but some buy gift cards or BTC. The thing is you already paid income tax on the money you will use to buy an alternant currency  which is its value at the time of sale. Then you will use that currency to buy a product or service that will come w/ sales tax or some other non personal income tax. So when you buy alternant currency you don't pay sales tax because what is bought with the aternant currency will have a tax and so not taxing the exchanging of "currencies" avoids double taxation. 
An example is you buy a $25 Amazon gift card. The gift card is $25 because when you buy another item the tax if there is one is going to be added on to the product regardless of any consious realization that this is happining by the buyer. 
Some states do not have sales tax but the basic premise is still the same the money is being taxed, either through personal income taxes or corporate taxes (when exachnged into USD, in this case the BTC is not taxed). 
In summery; If you have a thousand dollars it has been taxed via personal income tax, if you use the money you have left over to buy BTC then it is not taxed because you already paid a tax on that amount in USD, if you buy a ten dollar DVD from a company or a service then they pay a tax on the USD that the BTC will be changed to at some point in time becuase they just made money which means the IRS will tax it. Please remember that coporations are considard people in the eyes of the US goverenment when reading this. 
I understand that you are wondering slightly about appreciation when investing, the thing about BTC is: it is market driven so when you buy BTC at a specified rate which is equal to its market value at the time you have just locked in a rate and you used personal income that has already been taxed to do it. 
Part of me thinks that the next questions if I get any will be about inheritance taxes, corporate taxes, and investment taxes. The statements above are true for the situation you are describing BTC does not fall into the inheritance tax. It does not fall into coporate tax (because it is changed into fiate currency that is nationaly recognized by the companies accepting it, and they accept a relative amount of BTC that is equvalent to that fiate currencys value so they pay a coporate tax on the USD not the alternant currency accepted). It does not fall into an investment tax because it is not a public/private entitiy and by that I mean that no one person owns Bitcoin as a whole.  It is just a popular alternant currency) Public=goverenment in this case, Private = a business that is not owned by the  goverenment.

Sorry for such a late response I didn't know people were commenting. 
Bitcoin runs the very real danger for some people of becoming like the gold standard fiasco's of 1900's America. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:59:15
Sorry I forgot one thing. Let say you buy BTC, it appreciates and then you sell it to someone at a higher value, you then decide not to tell the IRS. This is a plausable situation that would be hard to track but audits can uncover this information. In this case the wise thing is not to get audited.

 I do assume that there are four common things known to have intrinsic value as in they produce value on their own. They are land, labor, capital (buildings), and entrepreneurs. Gold is not on this list ever.
Gold like bitcoin does not have intrinsic value as defined, I agree it is subjective. Saying intrinsic value does not exist is a false statement. Unless you argue that the only reason humans have things, and definitions is because humans exist and with out them the definition of intrinsic value and  intrinsic value would not exist.
I was just remarking on the fact the your statement could be either true or false depending the context you were framing it in.

Devaluation of the dollar does suck if you live in the country that has enacted it. How would respond to some one like me who says that its good outweighs its bad for the reason below?
"Devaluation causes a country's exports to become less expensive, making them more competitive on the global market. This in turn means that imports are more expensive, making domestic consumers less likely to purchase them." 
I agree that the government should put some reigns on their spending but I fail to see where the money to run a country would come from if borrowing was prohibited.  I like my roads, I like the military, I like firefighters, and I really like national parks. I don't like that the deficits enable the government to spy on everything I do. If the money was spent wisely the deficit would diminish. It is not the Federal Reserves fault that politicians are bad at managing money.
QE can give faith to investors by showing that they are backing the product (currency), investors invest when there are known proofs that it is likely to succeed. Yes it can cause bubbles but so can no interference in the market. 
The Great Depression is a good example of why we have a lot of the monetary policy we do today, it also a good example of why they work when utilized correctly. It is to soon to see if QE is going to cause trouble down the line but it is early enough to see that monetary policy's have been helping the economy.
The apocalypse of American currency is not close to happening because it is still a Safe Haven Currency "A major traded currency, such as the U.S. dollar or Swiss franc, used by investors and fund managers seeking a safe haven for their funds in times of market turmoil." 
Redistribution of wealth does work at creating or undoing imbalances in the economy and/or society. Since the 80's it has made the rich richer and wrecked the world economy. In the past when it was bottom up redistribution it made the economy grow. 
History proves that regulation works I would like to see some proof that your plan would work. I would also like to add that one of the biggest issues facing voters right now is monetary policy and as such  it should be a major part of your campaign because your constituents want sound policy that benefits society or at least themselves. Wealth is a major benefit to its holder in societal terms and physical/mental health terms.

I think you don't understand how gift cards work.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:58:10
Typically intrinsic value refers to something that produces a positive on its own. By this definition intrinsic value does exist. 
Of course you could be referring to the fact that intrinsic value only exist because humans perceive it and thus it would be fair to say that intrinsic value is made up. By this definition you are right in an abstract way, intrinsic value does not exist.

All you said in this answer is what you want to do not why you want to do it, seems like monetary policy and information about the Federal Reserve is something you may not know a lot about.

"No other online payment system besides bitcoin has the permanence of a cash transaction."
Touche ! I do get it now. Thank you posting a response, it is very well worded.  I had not considered this point of view to its fullest extent.  Now that I have considered it Bitcoin is even more dangerous in my mind.   Until a stable and accepted value standard is set for Bitcoin I am now against it entirely.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:31:25
Ok so as I'm sure you guessed I would've never invested in bitcoin and I still won't. But you gave me $.50 so I will give it a semi whirl and if I change my stance you will be one of the first to know.

Bitcoin does not discourage usage as a currency. People who invest in Bitcoin for monetary returns discourage bitcoin usage as a currency.  Speculating only achieves a gain when action is taken. I have am at a loss as to why you ended with "it is only really useful for speculating." 
I am willing to read a response if you have time. I am learning a lot and enjoying the conversation,
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:22:18
I don't write. I interact with internet communities like reddit. I am not going to write free pages of information and throw it on the internet and not get paid for it. There have been responses in this thread that indicate that people would be interested in a discussion.  I would be willing to do that as I said originally. 
 I can tell you now I skimmed your blog  you seem to hold Bitcoin in a high regard while ignoring its many economic pitfalls. Like the fact that as societies get bigger and the amount of Bitcoin gets smaller the system would collapse and an entirely new system would have to be put in its place. I'm talking about the fact that Bitcoin runs the very real danger for some people of becoming like the gold standard fiasco's of 1900's America.

I am an opponent of bitcoin as a money making investment. Does that meet your standard of a critic? My opinion of bit coin in general is that it is an alternate currency similar but not the same as a gift card. 
I have two business degrees and try to explain economics and currency to people on this sub who seem to be dropping their life savings into this alternate currency, sadly most of my posts do not get noticed. I would be willing to have a conversation but not a debate as I have never been trained to do so. Is there a way a comment thread could be set up to to accomplish a conversation. I do work so it would have to be open for a few days. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 17:43:39
Thank you for your reply. I am convinced that you believe every word of  what you are saying and that you feel your education has given you proof that you are right. I would like to start by saying that I never said QE and devaluation of the dollar are the same thing. So I do not appreciate you implying that I mixed them up as the same thing.
I did say that if you live in country that has a devalued currency it sucks, I said this because I know that imported items are more expensive. 
Imported items being clothes (the China textile industry), food (actually the government protecting that industry, devaluation or not), gold (IDK name a place that still mines gold), silver (same as gold), housing materials (China), energy materials (the middle east), transportation materials (Asian countries, maybe). 
The pattern is that we import a lot or protect pricing in a real free market (food) to ensure national food supplies are available in the event of a war (making it not a free market, not the feds fault that the government sees fit to protect this industry). The pattern is America is not exporting these assets in a competitive way and in some cases not making the product or making an inferior product.
QE does not necessarily cause inflation that is harmful. Yes all countries do it which is why it can be helpful to have a devalued currency while practicing QE. Economics is not finance but they do cross paths. Investors try not to invest in unstable currency markets so as proof of stability QE  happens and is a sign that  investments are backed by real value (a promise of payment). I am not going to say that this plan cannot cause harmful inflation. It is obvious that it can, as I said in my last post right now it is to early to tell if that is the case for this time period and its future.  
At this point most people would point out that what I said only shows that value in market currencies is made up. I agree all value market decided or not is a man made ideal but it is far more convenient than actually trading bushels of food, etc.  It is also one of abundant resource so that it can change with the demand of growing populations.
The depression of 1920 was not solved by  lack of government and fed intervention. "the government slashed its budget tremendously, and the Fed hiked rates to record highs".  I am surprised you use this example as a proof since it is clear that intervention was a part of this recovery. Please note that the fed still raises and lower interest rates to keep bubbles from happening or in some case continuing. The same entity that you want to destroy is the same entity that helped the depression that you think proves your point.

I spoke about one thing in my reply incorrectly.  the only things that are not of man-made value are land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.

Thank you for saying this. Honestly the moon people would know that you are right if they had taken economics 101. I am almost positive they got their economic theories from people who have never taken economics. 
I used to come on here to tell people how economics really worked but no one listened so now I am watching the demise of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:54:27
Sorry I just saw this otherwise I would have answered sooner. I really appreciate your response but as I am sure you guessed I disagree. I wish I was better with my words. I have no idea how to answer this with out screwing up. I understand your point of view but I do not think this is a good example for describing bitcoin. 
A horse is of course a biological thing, transportation is a symbol used to describe movement. The car was not an old technology of the horse and it was not an old idea of transportation. Transportation is simply used to imply movement. The car was a new object made to continue transportation in a way that was better than a horse. Bitcoin is not the same.
Bitcoin is an alternate currency that is used for the obtainment of other items. As you noted currency and digital payment are not new. Bitcoin is only new in its symbol which can be physical and/or electronic. It does and is what all currency does and is no matter what form it takes (it is a bartering tool to obtain stuff ). There is nothing new about Bitcoin when it comes to currency.

I did read read the article that I linked to. I'm really happy you liked the last paragraph. My favorite part of this paragraph is how it implies that a free market existed during the depression of 1920, because a free market did not exist during this depression it can not be used as a proof that the free market fixed the economy during the depression of 1920. 
Free Market definition "A market economy based on supply and demand with little or no government control. A completely free market is an idealized form of a market economy where buyers and sellers are allowed to transact freely (i.e. buy/sell/trade) based on a mutual agreement on price without state intervention in the form of taxes, subsidies or regulation. "   
The article that I linked to  makes it clear that there was a strong government intervention during this time. The ending of the article is wrong because it defines its whole premise on something that did not happen. 
In my post I was arguing that government intervention is needed when it comes to funding entire countries. The OP was arguing that it is not and used the depression of 1920 as an example.  The example failed because government intervention was used.

I replied this way because in economics the term "Banks create value" = Banks create money.
Also bankers may use their talents at work and you are just not aware of it. Your statement is a non proven generalization of a whole group of people.
 I just wanted to let you know so that the next time you talk about this subject you can appear to be the intelligent person that you are.
I agree that bankers, not all bankers, have done some awful things and I do not agree with rewarding them for it. At the same time change can only happen when an understanding of the nuances of the banking industry are achieved. When a statement of change is made through proven knowledge it is more likely to be accepted, even if the change is slow.

With all due respect you are both  wrong on some points. Economics and Bitcoins can be complex subjects so it is to be expected that not all discussions about it will be right 100% of the time. I would address all the statements but it would take way to long to go through every thing that is needed to make a coherent explanation of why you are both wrong on some of the things that you both posted.
