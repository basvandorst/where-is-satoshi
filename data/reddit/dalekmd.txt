This makes me very nervous. I've got my coins in a paper wallet on coinbase. If coinbase goes down just like Mt. Gox, does that mean my paper wallet turns into nothing more than a piece of paper? Or could I still redeem my money somewhere?

Where can I go to invest in Pantera? Is it a fund to research how to bring Dimebag Darrell back to life?

What exactly are miners doing or accomplishing when they run the hash programs? How does generating a bunch of random numbers until you get the right one increase the network's security?

I can't imagine there being that many bitcoin millionaires yet. Yeah, they are surely out there, but if bitcoin really was turning tons of people into wealthy barons overnight, we'd be hearing more about it.

Smart move on your part. Bitcoin is very cool in many ways, but if you aren't in a position to invest in an extremely volatile new thing, hold on to your money. Good luck!

Couldn't you just start mining some sha-256 altcoins with your gear?

Bitcoin is not a magical entity that is beyond regulation or government intervention. What kind of message does it send to the outside world if the bitcoin community tells governments to shove it? It doesn't matter how much you love bitcoin, if governments make its use illegal, it will fall.

Well, it all makes sense now. There is nothing left to learn about bitcoin after watching this video.

Because startups have the money to pay for shills right?

Hmm, does Netacad go over bitcoin at all? I got my CCNA before the october deadline, so I don't remember reading anything about it.

I really can't tell if this is sarcasm,

Good thing coinbase isn't an exchange then.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:22:04
Thanks for the extra help. I've got a ticket open with you guys now, but I won't bother you with it here.

I bought some BTC on Saturday. I'm going to be extremely pissed off if Coinbase tells me my order was "high risk" and cancels it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:04:56
Do we really need to see a post about Coinbase every time there is an issue? We get it; sometimes Coinbase is slow. Your problem is not special.

Assuming "to the moon" will come to fruition, we will see something interesting. The current big dogs like CEOs will retain their wealth. However, a large number of middle class and working class people will join them. I am, of course, talking about us early bitcoin adopters.
What will come of the sudden influx of millionaires? I honestly don't know. I would hope we would help the economy boom and create jobs.

Thanks for clearing this up, I've been trying to understand how I can easily put my coins in "cold storage".
So just to get some clarification here:
1) Update my bitcoin-QT client
2) Copy the wallet.dat file to a thumb drive (more than one preferably)
3) Delete the wallet.dat file from my computer
4) Put my wallet.dat file back where it was when I want to move my BTC
What happens if I start up bitcoin-qt without the wallet.dat file present?

If this guy owns $145 million in bitcoins, chances are he is one wealthy son of a bitch in fiat as well.

This is solid proof that no one can predict the future.

On another note, wow, this site is really damn good. I found a flight from New York to Los Angeles for like $250. I thought the minimum was twice as much.

I wish people would actually thank Olaf for the information instead of pretending their support ticket is more important than everyone else's.

I see so many people angry that others are selling their bitcoin. They scream "YOU SHOULD NEVER SELL BECAUSE BY THE TIME IT'S WORTH SELLING IT WILL BE THE CURRENCY TO USE ANYWAY!!!"
Look folks, bitcoin is wonderful, really, but some people just want to get out of the investment arena right now. Would you yell at someone who wishes to sell their stock because they no longer wish to hold that stock?

A discussion on how to safely trade bitcoins locally with other people?

Bitcoin can be a bit of a cult at times, so you have to take the hysteria in this subreddit with a grain of salt.
That said, I cannot think of the last time a new currency was introduced to the world, and the masses were given the opportunity to have at it before it reached widespread use. Bitcoin isn't a stock in a company. Assuming bitcoin really does succeed, can you honestly see it being worth any less than $10,000?
What I'm unsure of, though, is the influx of newly made wealthy people. Will early bitcoin adopters go down in history as the "Bitcoin Barons", the thousands of us that invested in BTC and became the world's new financial elite? Or will the value reach a point where we just make a few bucks?

Why is it that whenever there is a meet up of some sort, women are always lacking?
