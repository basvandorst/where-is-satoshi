I appreciate you taking the time to respond btw. I really am open to suggestions, leads or donations.  With that pig test completed and some additional funds, worst case, we can start in veterinary wound care. No FDA.

That might be the case today but not for us a few years ago! We ran out of money and the companies wanted us to recreate the proof of concept in a certified lab on pigs, not mice.  Minimum $20K test, each, 2 test minimum. Unfortunately for us the original footage was damaged. That was the unbeatable hurdle. Show me a Pharma company that will fund that testing and I will show them a serious product. Bring it on! I don't need billions of dollars, I just want to finish what I started and live comfortably.

Those investors planned on selling the concept to companies that would never let the product see the light of day due to big pharma competitors/contracts. I was not going to let that happen either. So before you make misguided assumptions try asking more questions first, please. 
It was not an easy journey to say the least. We have LOI's from major pharma companies for after we accomplished further testing that was estimated to cost ~$500K. 
Back then it was so innovative it caused hesitation since it was not derived from blood after getting classified as a Thrombin by wound care specialists. They even had a hard time catagorizing the product and didn't know how it was possible. Now it is easier for people to wrap their head s around due to competitors with products that have similarities.

I am open to suggestions if you have the answers.

I would have to dig through years of research but even with the extra step to sanitize the plasma, it is still not 100% safe. You have to pay thousands of dollars for that kind of info. Google is not a proper resource for that kind of research. 
The problem was I could not present what I had because of the damaged footage. FDA doesn't work with companies that have owners conducting human testing on themselves to prove a point. No one would flip the bill because back then it was though to be impossible by medical pros since it was not derived from blood. Vetigel came years later. As I stated I know what I have. 
I have stated where the needs are. You are researching a free source for information that doesn't include everything for what you are trying to put me down for. You have just been a negative here with no solutions. Useless and bitter. My post was taken down anyway. I suggest you change your demeanor and don't be so quick to react with simple assumed responses with out asking questions to understand what the other party accomplished and how they got there and what they already tried, ETC. then maybe you will avoid making yourself come off like a bitch. Maybe you should spend more time sticking to cancer research instead of wasting other peoples time on social media.

I am aware of Vetigel and other somewhat similar competitors products.  What is your profession if you don't mind me asking?

I already did all that, but thank you. I don't have the time or resources to go at all that again. It is do or die. This is my last attempt to connect with people in a position to assist.
Vetigel is not anti-microbial last time I checked.
