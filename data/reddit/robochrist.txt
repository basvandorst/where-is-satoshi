Investing in a company because you think the value of the company will increase for fundamental, measurable reasons = investment. 
Buying something because you think other people will value it more tomorrow = speculation.

Bitcoin as an investment vehicle is closer to a commodity than a currency. 
Most people weren't buying bitcoin to use to purchase things online, they were buying bitcoin because they were speculating that the price would increase in the future.

I didn't mean to imply that userbase wasn't important! Just curious as to whether there were any core differences between bitcoin and alternate currencies. It seems to me that if you're the type of person who is looking to daytrade and make massive gains (and accept the risk of massive losses), alternate currencies are the way to go... unless there are structural differences that mean a loss is all-but guaranteed if you hold too long.

That's how I feel as someone who has been involved in more traditional long-term investing. I've made about 35% in the past year, but of course that pales in comparison to the gains bitcoin has made. 
At the same time, I can be sure that my investments will never lose value that drastically, and I'd be concerned about that with bitcoin or especially altcoins. At 1k for a bitcoin, it seems very likely that bitcoin is being pumped.

If I were to buy altcoinX at $0.01 and it goes up to $0.05... would it be possible to immediately sell, or would I need to find someone willing to buy at that price? Given the smaller userbase, I can see that as a major problem.

The way I see it so far
Pro altcoin: Higher volatility, opportunity for massive gains
Anti altcoin: Higher volatility, opportunity for massive loses

If you find someone's wallet and you don't return the money, you need to accept that you're a thief. It would be awesome if someone gave you a finder's fee for returning it, but you need to take responsibility for your own actions.

I knew that was true for bitcoin, I didn't want to make a false assumption about the various alternate currencies.
