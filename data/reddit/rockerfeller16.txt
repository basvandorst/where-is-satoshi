I disagree with your analogy.  In my opinion, a car has value because it has a legitimate use (getting from point A to point B a hell of a lot faster than walking or riding a bicycle).  People are willing to pay for the convenience of owning a car.  I did not buy my car because I value the skill and effort of the manufacturers.  I bought it because I value the convenience a vehicle has to offer.

Personally?  No because I do not fully understand BTC yet and do not trust it.
If such an agreement were to take place, I would imagine "a deal is a deal" since the agreement was made at the time BTC was valued at $15000

Okay, but why is it valued in the first place?  It just looks like something that someone made up.  For instance, I could take a piece of paper, tear it up into twenty pieces, draw a symbol on each piece and call that a currency too.   What makes bitcoin something that should be valued and able to be exchanged for USD?

Why are you willing to buy it?  I understand the concept of supply vs. demand but why is there demand?

So if I understand you correctly, it is not Bitcoin that is valued but the time, effort, and dedication of the programmers that invented it?

Why does it make sense for there to be value generated because computers are doing math?  I do not understand why money results from computers doing math.  Is there an actual purpose for the solutions the computers are calculating?  It isn't making any sense to me.

Thanks for the response.  I totally agree with your first paragraph. 
Your second paragraph is talking about the popularity and usefullness of the blockchain, not BTC or cryptocurrency.  You trust the ledger (blockchain, not cryptocurrency).  That is awesome and all, but why does that give BTC value?  My only guess is because it is one of few currencies right now that can use the blockchain in order to make trustworthy transactions.

Would the courts here in America take me seriously if I had that same contract but with Bitcoin instead of the US Dollar?

No reason for fees.  Just move the bits.  D
Shouldnt cost shit

Yadontech, this is probably the closest to a perfect answer that I could ask for.  Thank you for this!  But I do have a follow-up.  With gold, miners could occasionally hit a large pocket of gold or get nothing at all.  With USD, there is only in circulation that which the US Mint decided to print.  What is the reasoning behind how Bitcoin is generated?  Why can a person with a computer "mine" Bitcoin and then convert it to USD?  It's hard to properly phrase such a question but I hope my point got across.

But what causes people to believe cryptocurrency has value?  I know it is not an easy question.

Can you elaborate?
