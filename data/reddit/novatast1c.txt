He doesn't own it, but just like ManuaGamine has mentioned, I'd bet my ass that he is involved.

And everything is up substantially on the 7 day average. The race to Trillion Dollar Marketcap has begun.
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:05:13
That is really impressive.

Why tf are you even using Coinbare at this point?!
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:47:47
Now is the best opportunity.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:51:53

So far in 2018 it looks like at least four nations will be maintaining some portion of reserves in bitcoin. This is the beginning of the gargantuan national wealth adoption phase with trillions to flow in. The money involved is astronomical. The flood is coming.

That's not completely true.
Buying 1 BTC, hodling for 1 year and selling it afterwards is indeed free, but if you trade with BTC, you have to pay taxes, even after one year.

to be honest I dont even believe that it will reach 10k $ in Q2 2018..
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:40:11
That's true. I don't know why I get downvoted, but I suggest to check out [r/bitfinex](
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:02:54
There are rumors about Bitfinex being insolvent.

Is it worth using Nicehash when I can only provide (multiple) CPUs?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:44
Ignore the drama and focus on the technology.
