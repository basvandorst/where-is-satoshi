Having a "paper wallet" is literally just knowing a private key (which is very much like a password). The public key can be derived from the private key. And the amount at that address can be found online using the public key. So, write that private key down on paper, and voila, you have a paper wallet (though this is *not* the recommended way to store coins in 2019).
If anyone has any way to discover your private key then, like a password, it is indeed unsafe. If someone in 2019 actually gives you a paper wallet your immediate next step should be to transfer those coins to your own secure wallet.

It has been battle-tested to a ridiculous degree compared to other cryptos. It shelters them all from the laser focus of every hacker and every corrupt person in power on the planet. If Bitcoin disappeared could your crypto of choice survive that much heat? Could you ever know if it could survive it until it happens?

Why would borders matter with an entirely non-physical currency? You can't "carry" bitcoin into the country. This is them either totally misunderstanding what bitcoin is, or using it as an excuse to infringe on our inconvenient rights. Either scenario is depressingly plausible.

Do your friends think that the banks can just go to the "All of the Bitcoin" store and say, "I'd like to buy one all-of-the-bitcoin, please"? Every transaction requires a buyer and a seller. Most coins that exist are not available on any sort of exchange or marketplace. The individuals or entities who control them are spread all over the world with their own concerns and agendas that have nothing to do with the US. The banks can't overcome this lack of access just by being super-rich.

The crypto space is full of new people who've never really experienced losing before. Though I think BTC will keep going up over the long term, it has definitely given people a false sense of confidence. The only altcoins I became interested in are ETH and FCT. Everything else was setting off my old penny stock alarms. Maybe a bunch of them will succeed, but I'll happily take crazy gains over possibly crazier gains.

Every time you spend bitcoin on something you're "selling" it. If you originally bought that chunk of bitcoin for less (which you almost certainly did) then you owe capital gains tax. This is how it's currently treated by the IRS.

I could see $100K in ten years. I don't know about a million. Bitcoin would have to be free of all malicious interference and all scaling problems would have to be addressed promptly with solid tech in order to see prices like that. Unfortunately Bitcoin is in the hands of human beings. 
My reasons for its success are:
- It's deflationary.
- A sliver of the world's wealth will move over to it from gold. 
- It will likely be adopted as the de facto currency in many third world nations (see Venezuela).
- It "creates" (frees up) massive amounts of wealth in the sense that it cuts out so many middlemen, both by being global and by being trustless. 
The things that worry me are:
- It will be twisted into something that serves greedy, powerful, short-sighted people rather than humanity as a whole (this has already been attempted).
- Governments react to their loss of control by criminalizing the use of it in some way. 
- For Bitcoin specifically, another crypto will eat its lunch (the scaling wars made this plausible).  
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:24:46
So when you received Bitcoin for your services you "bought" it and then you "sold" it when you exchanged them for something else. You have to keep track of the amount you received/used and what the Bitcoin value was at the time. It's FIFO so there's the added hassle of keeping track of which chunks get sold when. 
- You receive 1 BTC when it's $2700 (lot one).
- You receive 1.5 BTC when it's $2800 (lot two).
- You spend 1.75 BTC when it's $2900.
- You spend 0.75 BTC when it's $3000.
The taxable events work like:
- Lot one was completely sold for a $200/BTC gain ($2700 to $2900).
- Lot two was partially sold for a $100/BTC gain ($2800 to $2900).
- The rest of lot two was sold for a $200/BTC gain ($2800 to $3000).
This gets complex pretty quickly when many lots have a lot of overlap.

Well, yes, mining CEOs trying to convince the world that it's in our best interest for mining to be centralized to their giant farms... that's just transparently slimy and it's what you'd expect from those people. But when they politicize it and market it just right, they can convince a disconcerting number of people. I fear their techniques can only get more sophisticated over time.

If you actually want to ever move your coins, [Hierarchical Deterministic]( wallets are a very smart and convenient solution. Paper wallets are extremely clunky by comparison. Hardware wallets just happen to be the best and most secure way to utilize HD wallets.
Here's just one example. Let's say you were using paper wallet cold storage back in the days before SegWit. You went to great lengths to secure your private key. You stamped it into multiple pieces of metal, buried them, hid them in crawl spaces, whatever. Then SegWit comes along and you want to transfer your coins from the legacy format to the new format. To do this you now have to go through the whole process again with a new private key.
Do the same thing with an HD wallet and you have a great big chain of available addresses tied to a single seed. Stamp that seed into metal and hide it and you can get an incredible amount of use out of it without ever having to redo everything.
If you were truly not touching your coins I suppose you wouldn't care if they were SegWit or not, but imagine the same scenario where you need to spend $100 worth of Bitcoin on something and you're weighing whether it's worth it to go through that whole process again or to just buy more Bitcoin (with all that hassle that might entail). With the HD wallet there's no dilemma whatsoever.

Bitcoin loves cup-and-handles. My vote would be that it has a bunch of trouble at $20K and pulls back for a little while. Then it tests it again, people see it push through the resistance, and the euphoric buying starts.

I don't know the specifics of how it's actually done (there are surely multiple approaches), but if I were designing a payment system I would probably present each user with a unique address to send the funds to for each transaction. If money appears at that address then it was a success.

A larger block size does come with problems, but the size increase was by far the least dangerous thing about S2X. And it worked to their benefit that so many people thought a size increase was the only impact S2X would have on bitcoin.

An unacceptable level of centralization and corporatization, the codebase being maintained by far fewer people of questionable competence, the fork being rushed and inadequately tested, the giant mess that comes with no replay protection, etc. This was nothing at all like a situation where competent core developers do a 2MB upgrade the right way.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:33:09
I'm against big blocks if they outpace Moore's law and make it so that it's mainly corporations that have enough resources to run the network. Block size increases should only happen when analysis shows that the centralizing effect will be negligible.
If we're at that point today, great, push 2MB up Core's priority list. If we aren't at that point yet then I'm against bigger blocks. I wish I had a better idea of the current results of that analysis, or even who's doing it.

I've read that customs agents have actually tried to treat bitcoin owners as "carrying money into the country" which is a scary display of ignorance from people who can get you in a lot of legal trouble. No, you can't carry bitcoin. They exist only in the blockchain and have no physical location. If the law disagrees then we need better laws.

From where? Not everyone uses Coinbase (and Coinbase only recently provided that feature). Remember the whole point of crypto is owning your coins and getting *off* of exchanges. And even if you do everything on Coinbase, a few friends borrow cash and pay you back in crypto -- that's enough to completely throw off a Coinbase spreadsheet because it causes all the lots to change. There are a hundred messy real world scenarios like that. The software you're describing that captures all real world usage doesn't exist yet.

LN is awesome. But as a whole bunch of naive bitcoin owners discovered this month, the US tax system *hugely* disincentivizes us from using LN as described in the article. Every "cup of coffee" transaction we make over the LN is a distinct record of capital gains. It fragments our purchases of bitcoin into more and more lots that get too unwieldy to track manually. For LN to work we need software monitoring our transactions that can do all of that heavy lifting for us and knows the crypto tax law (which is itself nebulous) well enough to spit out something valid that can be imported into tax software. The closest analog in the pre-crypto world is the hundreds or thousands of transactions that day traders report at the end of the year. With something like TurboTax those records can be fetched right from the brokerage.
Until that exists the only way that I can sanely use crypto as money is to fill up a debit card once a month and report capital gains twelve times. In a sense I'm being my own LN that way, and for the foreseeable future that's way more sensible.
I hope that if we're making retail transactions with crypto with phones or cards or whatever, the same software that's doing that work will be doing the tax work concurrently. Because (barring major changes to the tax laws) just by using crypto we'll all take on the same sort of tax overhead that day traders do.
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:27:17
Sure, but if you have to break the law to use the LN with the gleeful abandon we're all dreaming of, that's not a great selling point.
