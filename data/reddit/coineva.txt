You need to sell your LTCET first. So if you want to withdraw LTC, convert your LTCET to LTC first, take your loss and then withdraw.

You are a true hero! You inspired me to do the same (on a mini mini scale in comparison)
Good luck with making wise decisions and select the best out of these numerous requests.

Yes after a fork you own 2 separate coins, both with their own value. You don't have to do anything, just sit and wait. Or sell one of them if you prefer of course...

Sounds like you took it serious enough if you backup-ed all your seed words.
Did you try to import those seed words in Electrum?
Create a new wallet, select 'I already have a seed' and then you probably have to use the 'BIP39 seed' option

Yes I agree people should read into Bitcoin before using it and better understanding and education is needed, but far more important is to create better hardware and software and increase the usability of Bitcoin. Almost no one knows the technical details of how their car works, yet MOST people know how to use it and drive safely.

Well face reality, at this moment most people are better off storing their bitcoins at the bank than owning a private key they do not understand. Besides a bank-app can be quite handy if you can use to pay at the supermarket, you don't have to use it and you don't have to store ALL your bitcoins there.
