This is genuinely one of the dumbest threads I've ever seen in my life

You speculated and got lucky, it could've easily went the other way.

Very obvious after it's happened. 
You can't predict a bubble, don't be such an ignorant fool.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:24:32
Lol everyone's pretending it isn't happening

It must be sarcasm, he purchased Bitcoin purely because of hype and at a price that's way too high.

Or an investor that understands things.
You see ANY serious investors or economists saying you should buy Bitcoins?

This is an Apple graph over 5 years, it's not even remotely the same.

You have no understanding of investments, you just speculated on something and got lucky, keep doing it - your money will be gone soon. 
Your exactly the same as the morons during the dot-com bubble.

Probably because bitcoin isn't an actual currency and never will be.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:18:49
Unless the thing you learnt was that you should've never invested in Bitcoin, and you making money was complete luck - you haven't learnt anything.

Bitcoin bubble hasn't burst, it hasn't even began yet.

Unreal how people are acting like this is some stock like Apple that's easy to determine if its undervalued.
Everyone's just guessing that because its cheaper than it was it should be bought now, with no knowledge of how this works at all.

Apples stock climbed over years, and dropped over weeks, it didnt do everything within hours.
Stocks have intrinsic value, Bitcoin had nothing to support its price.
