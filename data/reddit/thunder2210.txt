+1 PayPal is the shittiest platform I have ever dealt with in my life.

That's if not every sell has a buy waiting! No commodity can get to zero value as long as it's being traded. The only thing that can really hit zero or very close to it is fiat money!

If PayPal supports Bitcoin, it will be the end!! PayPal is the company with the WORST customer services I have ever seen in my life. Very unprofessional, so arrogant, like you are begging from them. 
Imagine, a customer service representative talking to a customer saying: "That's it sir, end of the story"!!

Nope, I don't actually hold any BTC, but the Bitcoin situation is affecting the whole market. I have a diversified portfolio, some of them are profitable, but the overall portfolio is in heavy losses. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:25:16
Let's forget about the consensus then. When do you think we can see a change. I don't mean a dramatic chnage like Nov/Dec, but a gradual change to a healthy trend? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:31:36
Too late unfortunately, I'll make huge losses if I decided to sell now. Thanks for the advise anyway, will look into that in the future for sure.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:19:31
Thank you for your comments. I know it's still a baby market compared to other markets like stocks and commodities. 
I didn't invest what I can't afford to lose, but nobody wants to lose anyway! I don't want to make crazy profits or buy a Lambo, I just need to feel that I can at least make profits on the long run, which I'm not seeing now.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:23:32
Thank you Jimmy. How long do you think investors will be in such reluctant state? If the market is going to recover, then this state can't obviously stay forever! 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:29:52
It's not so cute when you have targets and a family! 
P.S: I'm holding some coins since last January 2017, and they are profitable, just try to look at the bigger picture.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:28:41
Thank you, I really hope so. Timing of profits sometimes is as crucial as the amount of gain!

Exchanges &amp; ICO projects can be regulated to control fraud, thefts, financial liabilities, etc... But not wallets I believe.

Or until people become so desperate and dump to reach huge lows so that the greedy BGDs can jump in so low. They don't have an issue to wait, they have a lot of spare money anyway, not like the small traders who need "real" money to feed their families! 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:28:59
I would say it's the same. Expectations due to network performance, consumer adoption, etc.. same arguments!

And, they are out there playing on your psychology so you continue dumping a "too-good-to-let-go" investment source that can easily yield billions by just playing the FUD-FOMO game!! Wake up guys!
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:40:05
Yeah, some people just have short memory span.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:05:08
Yes I do, and if I had millions of extra ($) like all the big whales, I can prove it to you right now in less than a day!! 
Just think about all these billions made last year (around $300 billion). If a small group is controlling the majority of these billions, why wouldn't they get into the market again very cheap after flushing out all these week hands and make another $300 billions?! Would you let go such opportunity to buy very cheap and sell again at $20K in a very open decentralized market?! 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:53:16
I did invest 60K and I'm holding because I know for sure that if I was a billionaire, I could've easily played with all these week hands and get billions on the way up, which I can also make it happen easily!!

Again, the crypto market (Not only BTC) is saying: This is not the end!! The technology and the concept is here to stay regardless of all the FUD. 
Every time you think this FUD is new, take a look at this:
“Almost all of the many predictions now being made about 1996 hinge on the Internet’s continuing exponential growth. But I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.”

+1 from a fellow Egyptian
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:48:43
Yup, it's totally dead again for the 21st time!! 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:08:14
Some people do in the daily discussion! 
@_date: 2019-02-27 11:54:28
Well, at least there is a "new high"
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:28:21
I have been buying monthly, constantly, regardless of the price. I argue people to do the same.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:01:20
Adios amigo, it's been an honor! ��
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:56:55
Beautiful indeed, congratulations for the good ride.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:30:29
I lost around $70K, in real, not on paper. But I'm still holding!! 
@_date: 2018-11-06 12:53:00
Only a pair of birds more please!
@_date: 2018-07-12 10:59:16
That's nothing compared to seeing McAfee eating his dick!! 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:51:20
Yeah, I still regret this time when I had the chance to buy at $800!!
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:54:00
This is what happens when retail investors buy high and sell low, unlike serious investors!
