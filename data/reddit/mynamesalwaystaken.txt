Ok, you have a currency that these guys think is anonymous and not regulated. (They are wrong :)) It's assigned a value, based on demand (none of these guys bother researching the WHY, which would bust the bubble for them). WIth a recent fucktarded event called BTC, there was some odd attempt to mirror  bitcoins to create an alternate currency, you know, like magic ( What these anti trust/banking dumbass cry about with the Fed does it) that flopped, caused a few hours of panic, then a 3 day push to acquire bitcoin in case the BTC deal caused destabilization ( Which would not be possible with decentralised, anonymous and unregulated currency...but you can't fix stupid, right?), driving the price....People THEN sell off their bitcoins...for the same currency they bitch about and cheer :)
PS: Here comes the hate ;)

Not salty about cryptocurrency, but it's easy to assume that when you're viewing your side with blinders :)

Saw the same level of mental masturbation in Jan, Feb,March....The fact so many are still in now that Citi and Sachs are buying/selling..is pretty funny. It shows you that even those who denounce "trendy" behavior are no more adept at understanding they are now part of a trend that has money monsters openly involved.
If you were buying property, for investment, along a road and you found out that organized crime was buying it up as well, what do you think the end result will be?
Stagflation is going to screw so many people who figure they already made piles of bank, hanging on won't hurt them
Good luck to you all

Well, you got fucked today :)..and you are going to end up fucked in the future...the very near future. You can expect other corporations and countries to take China's approach and watch the market hit a free fall...which cryptocurrency is supposed to be safe from :)
Bitcoin has gone from investment to fad. Inflated along the way, making early investors filthy rich.
