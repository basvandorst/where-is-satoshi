Thanks. We'll try to add a QR code, once I can figure it out. Of course we'll need someone to test it ;-)

I'm a member of the executive of the Science Is Vital campaign which is trying to make sure the UK government increases funding to scientific research - currently it gets [less than 0.5% GDP which is the lowest in the G8]( and the government is talking about further cuts.
As part of our new campaign that starts tomorrow, we've decided to try accepting bitcoin donations as an experiment (at 1NhACLde1TcccN4uvhN8ir4RhBqXngCsmR); we need to cover the costs of hiring rooms and equipment and paying for webservers for our IRL and online events. By sharing the information (or even a few millibits) you can keep science funding on the political agenda in Britain, so that in turn UK science can produce more of the medicines, technologies, knowledge and ideas that will help improve life in the rest of the 21st century.

Quite right. With more people struggling for fewer resources, integrity is often a casualty. This is why we need to oppose cuts and invest in the future of scientific research.

Thanks so much for your donation. You are the first person ever to donate bitcoin to Science Is Vital!
I take your point about the QR code and will see if I can work out how to embed it.
