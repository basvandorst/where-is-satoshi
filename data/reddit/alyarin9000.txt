Not necessarily. We do understand the root causes of aging now... And the science is advanced enough for Etherium's cofounder to donate 2.4 million dollars worth of Etherium to a major research foundation (SENS)

It's looking hopeful. The cofounder of Ethereum actually just gave anti aging research a massive boost a few days ago (SENS Research Foundation) Source: Medical student hoping to enter the field

You need to upvote the thread which is pro-sens, FYI.

SENS would probably be the most important org to donate to. If they succeed, the amount of lives saves will be staggering.

Of all 160,000 deaths that happen in a day, 100,000 occur due to aging. These deaths are not romantic or "peaceful" in any way - they come after years of immune system failure, bones breaking repeatedly due to increased bone brittleness, years of pain due to cancer, an agonizing heart attack (if you're lucky this will be when you sleep), loss of memory of your loved ones and passions due to stroke, and/or dementia - where you slowly live through the horror of forgetting your loved ones, knowing it's happening every day. By the end, you wake up each day to find yourself in a strange room, filled with needles - you panic, and this only causes you to be tied down.
100,000/160,000 deaths. every 10 days, 1 million people die of this. If this were *ANYTHING ELSE*, we would see it as a great tragedy that must be fought with all available resources. Instead, we have grown used to it - but should we? Should those living hundreds of years ago have grown used to cholera?
Those who could live longer could still be hit by a truck or bus, so this does not mean 'eternal life', by any means. The main point to look at, is that this is medicine for the elderly which would maintain health - something we have to seriously look at, given that the world's population is aging at an astounding rate.
Beyond this, people don't look at climate change as an issue. Why? Because they do not think that they will be alive long enough to witness it. *Imagine* the long-term thinking governments and populations would employ under this kind of therapy. And don't talk about "stagnation" - the elderly being unwilling to accept new ideas is mainly due to the aging process itself.
Debate me more, if you wish. I'll just conclude with one final question... *When do you want to get Alzheimers disease?*

SENS isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:38:04
You're misinterpreting the end-goal. It's impossible for people to be frail and 'old' and yet live - this is improving quality, which leads to increased diversity (due to lack of a rigid mind in the elderly) and quantity (due to generally increased health)
You cannot truly cure age-related diseases like Alzheimers without curing "aging", since alzheimers is just the damages of aging brought to the surface. At best you can slow alzheimers down for a few years if you do not treat aging, but it'll get to you eventually - and the decline will be much more slow.

I think this place is being brigaded with downvotes

Nope. Undergraduate planning on going into the field. Not affiliated with SENS... Yet.

The aging population crisis is advancing rapidly, and if we do nothing about it, the future will not be pretty. If SENS succeeds in time, we will be spared from this problem - and i'd imagine it'd increase the focus on climate change too. Not only that, but this causes 100,000 deaths a day - annual deaths are 160,000 - AND aging is more slow, so aging is really the largest cause of human suffering in the world.
I'm an undergraduate of Human Biosciences planning to work in the industry SENS is bringing about - if anyone has any questions about the science, feasability or anything else, please ask.

This is *incredibly* important! I 100% vouch for this org
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:30
And investors have already started to hop on previous projects SENS kickstarted. There's a visible end-product in production - GenSight biologics, for instance.
I'm an undergraduate in the field, so can answer any questions you have about the science and legitimacy - or anything else related, for that matter. (If you need to PM me, i'll get back to you)
It's also important to note that SENS is a registered 503 charity - they're legitimate for sure, and their expenses are 100% transparent

All of his answers can be found here - 
I'm an undergraduate aiming for the field, so AMA if you want any added detail - and please, update us when you're done looking through the replies

[I concur, this paper says basically the same thing that SENS does](
[Look at that citation number - and it's not all the citations it has, either. Search the paper on google to see the full number](

Read this and get back to me.
