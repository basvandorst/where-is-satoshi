Biggest joke I've heard this year.
Wait, he/she is not joking?

Bitfinex is a Hong Kong company, so even if Zane can't read it, someone else can.

So does Linux, more people are working on Linux.

Why Bitcoin needs to have any app? it is a currency isn't it?
What is the "apps" mentioned there? There are a lot of Bitcoin related apps.
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:33:25
If OP wants to do this, why don't OP just use exchanges?
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:33:41
Sounds like Foxy but with paying.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:01:56
I think your friend is going to regret one day, is your friend using Android or iOS, send him the news about  fake wallets on app store.
If your friend wants to sell his bitcoins for $12, you should have buy back for $13.
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:08:15
It is nice you do this, if it was me the one who found it I probably took the bitcoins already, that is life changing amount of money to a lot of people, including me.
I hope you found the real email address on whois, a lot of people don't leave real identity there.
EDIT: Did some calculations, 37 btc is like my rent for 9+ years at its current price, wow.
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:44:30
Wow there are a lot of adult pictures, just entered a few phrases and wow.
@_date: 2016-08-14 15:31:54
Kickstarter is and likely will not accept bitcoins. :(
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:01:46
There are only four in your list....
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:11:45
I think there are bots that randomly upvote and downvote posts.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:15:55
I asked information about this website [on Bitcointalk](
Little summary:
A lot of people said this website is a scam, but also some people said they are paid (read page 3).
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:57:56
Bitcoin will die if Internet is died.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:27:05
lol, what are you talking about exactly, there are many known wallets have iOS version.
Edit: I know what are you talking about now after seeing your twitter profile.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:43:21
But blockchain.info is not an exchange AFAIK.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:33:03
If the hacker(s) want to return 75%, he/she/they will just hack 29939 BTCs.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:08:22
There will be season 3.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:24:30
Is this makes any difference?
@_date: 2016-08-15 07:53:15
Size of the transaction? If the fee is not high enough and the transaction size is too big, the transaction might never get confirmed.
@_date: 2016-08-20 12:33:21
I think people should learn how to distinguish ads from normal search results.
It is not blockchain.info's fault that phishing ads show on search results.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:48:03
After a few second of google, I found [the transaction link]( on other website.
@_date: 2016-08-06 03:07:29
Your link to the transaction info is broken.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:14:26
The price crash :(
@_date: 2016-08-06 12:47:13
I am on my way of changing reused address to a unique new address on lots of websites, thanks for your help.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:20:58
Yes, I reuse my addresses a lot.
@_date: 2016-08-20 03:23:26
This website promote a browser extension, and in the FAQ it claims this extension mines Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:11:00
I wouldn't say they can recover with no problem because many people will take their bitcoins to somewhere else they consider "safer".
Even if only 29939 BTCs were hacked, there will still have some impact on price.
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:47:46
Hope your niece is able to figure out it is a seed for Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:03:19
I'll buy for $14.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:18:34
Thanks, I got it now.
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:10:27
I hope there will have AD blocking apps in the new app store, if not, I will switch to Brave or Firefox.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:33:57
Cleared out?
I see 44k transactions in mempool now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:23:38
Over a month ago I tried to send a very small amount of Bitcoin to exchange (with something like 20sat/B) and it finally came through.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:29:14
Return 1200 Bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:04:29

Not duplicate-able? Not so sure about that.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:00:11
Can people join any channel they want?
What if someone sends "dirty" Bitcoins to lightning channels? So Everyone in lightning network has a chance to be block by exchanges when they are using lightning network?
How can lightning network prevent double spend issue? If I broadcast two different lightning network transactions to two very far away nodes in the same lightning network, which transaction will be accept by the network? (and what if the two attacked lightning network nodes tries to close the channel when double spend happens?)
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:32:04
I realized you [reused same address]( as change address, that might make your wallet unsafe.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:15:22
Sorry, but I want to save(and share) my experience with Bitcoin somewhere on the internet :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:27:26
Someone might paid NiceHash for something other than mining, like [Brute force weak RSA keys](
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:06:06
RemindMe! 3 years "Bitcoin mass adoption?"
I really hope Bitcoin is ready in 2020, I wanted to buy a steam game on sale yesterday but it took 3x the game's price to make a tx, and I give up using bitcoin.
But consider how long it took scaling problem to solve (hard fork and Segwit activation), I can only hope lightening network become usable for normal users.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:23:38
Wonder what happens if you don't open ports on your router.

Dropped to 265 nodes as I am typing this message.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:41:26
They close-sourced an open-source project, wow.
They are not releasing updated version?
Centralizing BU nodes to themselves?
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:48:42
How terrible if they don't trust each other.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:33:19
I am not asking about private key collision though. or does public key collision means private key collision?
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:50:34
I registered at this website just for fun lol, registered and forgot about it.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:54:42
I will be scared if lots of people are generating public keys non-stop.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:39:05
I won't be the guy who I imagined lol.
Edit: Does this means even only me knows my private keys, someone can still steal my Bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-06-27 02:08:57
If someone makes this a thing, I will definitely install it.
@_date: 2016-06-27 01:55:24
Thanks, these informations helped me.

I think I found it.
put "satoshis.place" in query box on  click the node and it shows how much satoshis is in that node.
It has capacity of 10649499 sats now, the node earned 10449449 sats.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:25:52
I wonder how many satoshis have been spent to paint on the canvas, is there anyway to track this?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:27:26

If you look at the script for a second you will know the script only works in the url above.

While the price goes up, looks like transaction fees goes up as well.
There is more than 10,000 transactions in the mempool with equal or more than 60sat/b transaction fee.
Edit: Wow, it goes up to more than 10,000 with equal or more than 100sat/b transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:11:00

[What the video](

@_date: 2017-09-22 03:03:58
This post reminds me that Reddit still don't have 2FA feature for its users in 2017.

Your data is encrypted, but attackers can mess with encrypted data, end up unable to do any encrypted connections.
Edit: In the demonstration video, they altered HTTPS connection to HTTP one.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:52:30
[Link]( that use match.com as example.
Yes, in the video they said SSL strip tool can affect these misconfigured websites, but I don't know what misconfigure they mean.

It doesn't exist 100 years ago.

You can use VPN to encrypt your connections, but doesn't prevent attackers from letting you disconnect from your VPN provider.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:02:16
NO, you should watch demonstration video.

You don't want to mine Bitcoin with graphic cards.
Google this : what is Bitcoin ASIC miner
and you know why.
Edit : Don't try ASIC miner either, not worth it.

Can't think of any reason why he want to buy Bitcoins at midnight in a park which is probably no people there.
He could use online exchange to get his Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-21 13:42:28
Sure, we might consider doing this when 99.9999% of Bitcoin users quit.

goto %Appdata% (using file explorer) and find the "Bitcoin" folder.

Technically you can make more bitcoin, now, no one is prohibiting you from mining on your computer.
