Blocks are for the facilitation of mining.  Blocks are not needed in a pre-mined system.
You gravely misinterpret the algorithm sir.

this community is delusional
nobody even stops to remember that the only power the fed has is the most important one: GUNS
they coerce us into using whatever they want, because they're the ones with the guns
government/banks/fed/etc  are all the same entity in that you will be met with force if you cross any of them
any idea that their fedcoin will flop or whatever is CHILDISH because of this!
people actually trying to gauge the specifics while ***ignoring the barrel pressing down on their noses***.
***STOP BEING SO GOD DAMN NAIVE ABOUT THIS***
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:17:54
it's a naive sentiment to think they won't engineer their system to account for that.
they are the people, the ONLY people with the power to can your ass if you don't abide
the ability to stealth tax everyone via QE doesn't change in the slightest, I didn't mention stealth taxes and tax retention because I didn't expect anyone to be naive enough to try and argue with it.

nothing ***needs*** mining.  what is to stop every "endpoint" *that they call it* operating as needed without mining?  nothing.  every transaction signature is just as easily verified by each individual endpoint as normal.  mining is only for thawing the rest of the available money, and not a critical component.  without mining the nodes would simply smoosh everything together as a continuous never-ending block.  and with the new invertible bloom filter, it would be just as efficient as a miner-laden network.
what the fuck did you think that when all the btc are mined it all just stops?  nope!
also why the fuck do you think USD is considered primo in the blackmarket, because it has value, BECAUSE OF FORCE
you're just another naive and/or delusional person forgetting about the barrel pressing on your skull
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:55:18
that will work just as well as saying you forgot the password to your computer during an investigation

@_date: 2015-01-27 17:53:37
it would be simpler and less sinister to just premine the whole thing and allocate that to copying the current books
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:11:21
then it's like the human appendix
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:21:05
been shouting from the rooftops that the Fed is far ahead of the curve.  Don't be so naive to think that they're naive or ignorant.  They probably have several secret cryptocurrency stews in testing.  in fact, it would be trivial to entirely replace the current fiat/bond system books with the same balances in a new ecosystem for a more seamless transition than what one would think. 
they should "premine" the whole  thing though, anything else is folly
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:25:54
it needs blocks and mining not because it's impossible to do without, but because they designed it that way
big difference
as I said before verification of signatures can be easily done by the endpoints with a completely thawed system, no wasteful bullshit mining needed
also: gun-toting coercive entities like the fed are only fooling fools when pretending to have a comparable system
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:01:03
Money is power, but the fed and the government has never had any money, at least since before the Viet Nam war.  
Their only power is the legal ability to throw you in jail for not following their rules, and that's magnitudes more powerful than simply having lots of money.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:26:05
google also has a reliable history of censorship
the reason Napster and other centralized services were killed off is because they're lightning rods, not because they were actually breaking the law.

if anyone doubts that they even have secret blockchains in testing right now are just naive
***as if*** anything concerning the money racket doesn't get understood by the snake eating its own tail before everyone else.

the treasury is still needed to handle selling bonds to the  fed

trackers aren't hosting data either, just a machine-usable index, as opposed to a human-usable website.  it's the same shit in a different light.  It isn't "much different".  
If you want to argue that way then why not just disable the trackers, or use unaffiliated ones (remove the lightning rods), instead of kill the website as well?  because if they tried to pursue this idea legally they would have lost horribly because that would have exposed the true form of it all (various forms of link indexes) - they can't recognize what it is, because everything becomes obvious and clear-cut and that doesn't serve their case (because the case is bs)
so my statement "only serving links"  is entirely true  - trackers and all
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:45:13
So you're willing to evade taxes and break other laws and I should be too?
I was being blunt by saying guns.  I mean coercion by force.
they could call it whatever the fuck they want, and we still have to abide by it

de-facto auctions would definitely be banned
they would never go against-the-grain and allow this, especially considering how fast they crack down on politically controversial subreddits' existence.

Willy isn't wrong, just an irresponsible cunt
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:40:47
then why not premine the whole thing, and replace the current books with it.  fast,simple,waste free, secures the ability to do stealth taxation via QE
mining is for open systems like bitcoin
gun-toting coercive entities like the fed are only fooling fools when pretending to have a comparable system
guy with gun to your head says "my system is good because x", you start to waver and now you're smothering him with adoration for his awesome feature x.
you see what happened there?

it's a hot story
nothing cool about it
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:55:02
nothing is fair about being coerced with force to pay taxes
and if they wanted to bullshit less they could just premine it and copy the current balances
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:45:41
their stability will be in that they can and will coerce us to pay taxes with their system, under the barrel of a gun, disguised as "it's this way because it's the best way" and people will believe them, because they don't usually see that gun and the gun is never mentioned, and so regular, like seeing the moon in the sky it's not something to particularly notice day-to-day, so people will wrongfully assume their right that it's the best way, not the actual reason, FORCE

we don't know who invented the wheel, but that doesn't mean we have some moral fucking dilemma about using them
you're right, and the arguments here are very silly

everyone laughs and claps until taxes are required to be paid in Fedcoin
uh ohhh....
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:37:23
but they have guns to coerce you into paying taxes in what they want you to pay your taxes in
this is why they can get by with whatever monstrosity they come up with...
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:49:38
I admit that I am in fact somewhat delusional in thinking that people like you would listen to reason.
Do you have any actual argument to present?  You obviously know more than me based on your valuable and thought provoking insight. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:44:04
but it would still be treated as such because politics ability to misconstrue things knows no bounds.
just like the pirate bay was just an index of magnet links, and not actually copying data, but was still thwarted by angry politically powered entities.
lets at least try and be real

that printed money bolsters the insiders and taxes everyone else - another strong point
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:47:11
they do have it both ways, and any new way they need to have it.
look at how the pirate bay site was crushed even though it was "only serving links"
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:09:13
the state has a reliable history of trying to ban crypto (mathematics) that they can't crack
too bad the subject is too technical to lull public opinion about it, like they do with IP law, online streaming, ISPs, and other less technical concepts, otherwise we would be in hell right now
the Snowden revelations have rightfully put privacy on peoples' minds, and not in the way the state wants, good for us

at least it doesn't sink, like your argument.
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:25:31
the two are synonymous and colluding so
and neither one actually have any money
the "bonds" are just pieces of fancy paper
the fiat is also worthless, it's a dog'n'pony show at best
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:42:35
they pretend to have consensus because it confuses the masses, if they called it "paytaxeswiththisorgetthrowninjailcoin" people will outrage, if they instead pretend that it's even slightly comparable to something the more tech savvy people want (bitcoin) then it sets a different feeling
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:31:35
they will continue using guns to force us to use whatever-the-fuck they come up with
people don't get this part, you pay taxes in the denomination of money that ***they choose***  and you can't rebel  against it, because guns
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:30:01
it is smart, but the fact that they will have mining, instead of premining it all, is complete steaming-pile-of-shit folly. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:25:29
it uses asymmetric encryption to sign outputs
Unauthorized spending is mitigated by Bitcoin's implementation of public-private key cryptography. When Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob, Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin. Eve observing the transaction might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received, but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob's private key.
and if you think about it all internet protocols involve messages of one sort or another,  bitcoin isn't normally used to send text messages, but it uses messages (signed transactions) nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-01-27 17:56:52
the only power the FED has is  that it has guns to coerce you into paying taxes in whatever-the-fuck-they-want-coin
that's the entire situation summed up.  they have never had any actual money, neither has the government.
@_date: 2015-01-12 18:20:32
oh they understand which principles are good for them, and which need to be stifled or made socially taboo
it's a good thing the average person can see how nonsensical it is to try and ban math, otherwise we would be back in the stone ages with clergy and noblemen with "math permits", and anyone else caught performing math would be put to death.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:40:29
but why allow the plebes to grow rich and use their wealth against us when we can make them and their descendants into neo-feudalism debt-slaves to prevent it.  Keep it nearly balanced and gradual enough that nobody will suspect a thing.
and to top it off we can use inflation via QE to bolster our insider buddies
it's really a good system for us.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:13:24
sinister because the only purpose the feature has is to make it appear to have the same qualities as something we like, not to provide QE or whatever
they premine it they can still do QE just as easily as with the current FIAT gun backed system
it's naive to buy into their imitations without criticism
they try to foster sentiment behind the barrel of a gun - it's ***hugely naive*** to ignore that

the state can very well make its own fork that completely replaces the economy, with relatively small effort
the way i see it is, if govt embraces it, then it will be a good thing
in fact, i would go andnsay that we should put together a fork just to simulate "neo y2k"
simply reserve money for the future budget and FDIC and send that to the BLOCKCHAIN TREASURY DEPARTMENT
could even integrate the existing fed and treasury as the private key holders and genesis block authors
the thing is, the USD is an imaginary construct, which can be easily integrated into a mathematical algorithm, along with the current budget and "debt"

I have a cogent perception of the world.  I prefer not to buy into too much bullshit - like the idea that it's possible to live "off the grid" and/or trying to pretend to authorities that I lost all my money.
I'm also not naive enough to think that the state won't crack the fuck down on me if I try to evade taxation.
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:04:10

don't get me fucking started on how limited you are in the current regulatory environment , in that you can't do shit anonymously with BTC except black market operations, and how "they" will definitely find out where you get your money - don't be so god damn naive.
