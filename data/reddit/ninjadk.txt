Bitstamp is good. They have Segwit integrated, meaning cheaper and faster transactions.

luke-jr wrote in the pull request that: "Basically this makes Core a blockchain-only node and disables off-chain transactions. "  
does this mean that using this wont work with a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-09-04 05:14:44
Using your full node to transact helps confirm that a payment was sent/received unlike having to rely on [blockchain.info]( for a number of confirmations to trust upon. It's recommended to transact using your full node if you care about privacy and trust. VERIFY!

The guy was busted because he had 5 big packets all labelled to be sent to him, when the police searched his place they found a USB key that had an unencrypted word document containing his bitcoin address, recovery seed and his private key. He pretty much went full retard in regards to security.

You have to sell it for flat, which you can't do with blockchain wallet. Move your BTC to an exchange (and add your ID), and sell it for flat there to then withdraw it to your bank account.

Why the fuck would you store 40.000USD in BTC on an exchange? Meanwhile you did not even take the most basic steps to secure your Google account which was used for 2 factor authentication. Third, you stored a picture of your passport in your google drive? I'm sorry for your loss, but you could have prevented all this yourself. It's an expensive lesson learned.

From my understanding doing RBF creates a whole new transaction/TXID - what happens to the old transaction, is it somehow "marked" as "should be avoided/double spend" for miners? Otherwise i suppose it could technically confirm in a couple of days/weeks. But wouldn't it only get marked as a double spend if it uses the exact same inputs and fee, or is using the same exact inputs enough to create a double spend?

Bitcoin is an electronic payment system based on cryptograph proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. So it essentially solves the problem of trust AND censorship.
Bitcoin is volatile because it is still relatively young technology. The real adoption hasn't begun yet, and when there is enough people using the technology/more infrastructure and apps being built the price will stabilize. It's the first of it's kind. \[[Watch this](
Bitcoin is decentralized - China as a country does not control the Bitcoin network. Yes, a big number of mining pools are based in China due to cheap electricity, but people buying hashrate from these pools can always move it elsewhere. If the pools were to collide and do a 51% attack on the blockchain it would be shooting themselves in the foot, as the effort of doing a 51% is FAR greater than the benefit - it would not make sense from a economic standpoint. \[[Watch this](
Do you have credibily sources for the price manipulation you're mentioning? The overall volume has been growing rapidly across exchanges as more people are learning about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:43:05
I think the UI seems to be really smooth and easy to understand, my only recommendation would be to have the option of setting a custom fee alongside incrementing/decrementing. It could simply be a "link" saying "I want to use a custom fee" which when clicked displays a input field and a button. I know you're only incrementing by one satoshi/byte at a time, but if you wanted to increase it by a fair amount you would have to click the increment button quiet a lot. :-) Great work!

Yeah that's a good point. I might hold the BCH/BCC for a few hours, i'm a bit worried that Kraken might crash, since a lot of people will be looking to trade, despite them being generally solid. I think your idea might be the best if looking to sell as soon as possible though.

Ask yourself, why would anyone sell you mining power, if they could benefit more by keeping it themselves? Sadly a scam that many people keep falling for.

Well it is technically safe, but if your account is compromised then you're fucked. I'd recommend you a hardware wallet if you're storing big amounts, but for not so big amounts blockchain.info is fine. 
I used blockchain.info to buy my first bitcoins and i've honestly never had a problem with their service. If their website goes offline, you can download the source from github, and run it on your local or own web server to control your funds.

I disagree. If people were intelligent they would find alternatives to our current banking system, just look at Danske Bank and it's share value not to forget Nordea. Just because you don't understand how the blockchain works doesn't make it "magical internet money". But i guess it's as magical as the number shown in your bank account, but with a blockchain you can actually verify what you own yourself instead of relying on a third party (bank) to tell you, requiring trust. :-)
