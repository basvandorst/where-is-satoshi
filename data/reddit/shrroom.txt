Yeah. I would pay if I had important files. My mother once opened a email and got her files encrypted. But she didnt have any important stuff, so I just reinstalled the whole pc.

The hackers do give the files back. If they wouldnt give it back, they would get a reputation for not doing so..Therefor ppl wouldnt pay the ransom. And they wouldnt make money
Heard of a couple of people were in this situation, and they paid and got access to the files again.
