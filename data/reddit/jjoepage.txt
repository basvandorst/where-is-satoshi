The true origin is from Warcraft where a designer messed up 'owned' and put 'pwned' which also became viral.  Now, Bitcoiners who need to fill their world with cool stuff took the idea and made it their own with Hodl.  For all you that think it was originated in cryptospace - you've been pwned.

Everyone already left the Bitcoin network and they are all busy doing something else.  Didn't you see the transactions number drop like a Led Zepplin?

People don't seem to understand the nothing at all increases Bitcoin's value more than those stupid necktie idiots in the white house voting away the wealth of future generations - 'for the good of society today'.  Bitcoin at $50,000 is undervalued.  Consider what $20 trillion really means if you want to understand why.

Yeah, that probably won't upset the government much.  Defacing their currency to promote yours.  I am sure they will be even more in love with Bitcoin once this trend starts taking off.

What about the ladies?  What should they do to update their full nodes?

Now is the best time to buy.  You are not permitted to buy 'last year' any longer.  However, you are permitted to buy now.  So 'best time' is the one whereby you can still actually do something.

I love this.  Factom is looking very good indeed.  I am excited to see the new features they are bringing to the blockchain.  Way to go guys.
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:26:53
Got a feeling Factom is going to bring about some very nice new function.  Standing by watching this one take off.

Well then, since you have water, you will be in a good position to make a giant swamp cooler.  Evaporation will provide the cooling you need.  Do not use batteries.  They are far too expensive in view of the amount you'll earn from mining.  Just run the mining during the times excess power is available from the array.  There is no advantage to be gained by putting that juice into a battery and then taking it out at night.  Put all excess electricity straight into the miners.

You don't really need to 'test' it.  Either you are not capable of performing the calculations, or you have performed them and don't believe them.  I can assure you, the math is very reliable and certain.  You will not be able to devise any configuration that gets around the fact that the per cycle earnings will be lower than the per cycle cost of using a battery bank.  Why 'test' it?  The per cycle cost of any battery bank is very well known.  The per cycle (total joules) earning in bitcoin on the very highest efficiency miner is well known.  What does the test accomplish?  Tests are great when you have some mystery that math can't accurately model.  You most certainly do not have that case here. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:27:14
I know.  Each time you cycle your battery, you take life from it.  You will not earn enough in bitcoin from the current from ANY battery bank to pay for the cost of that battery cycle.  The battery bank that can yield this kind of low cost does not yet exist.  Lead acid is cheap, it's just not that cheap.  This strategy will only produce a loss.

Dan, I ran 70Th in hot, hot, hot Las Vegas when 70Th was a lot.  I don't any longer.  But I can help you set that up.  Not saying it is a good idea.  The first thing you want to do is forget about AC.  No matter how much power you have that is a bad idea.  Take all the power of AC and put it into more miners.  Cool with high air flow - not with low air temperature.  1000 times more efficient.

OMG!!  I don't care about the insane money we are all making, I just like the trollbox.  Fix the trollbox!!!

All bitcoin mining gear is already made to withstand airflow in the degree I am describing.  AC is for humans.  Semiconductors don't really need to be at 40C.  They are very happy at 80C.  Airconditioning isn't designed for 80C.  On the other hand, ASICs need to get rid of a large quantity of heat.  AC is bad for large quantities of heat.  A fan on the other hand, even in the very hot desert of 50C or 60C will keep a semiconductor at 80C if the flow is great enough.  It is the same thing as an old air cooled motorcycle.  Just fine as long as there is air passing by.  In an extreme case, use a HUGE swamp cooler to make cooler air.  Cheap, and still efficient for ASIC cooling.
