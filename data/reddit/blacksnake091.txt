Maybe I don't understand Bitcoin, but doesn't it currently have a 'governing body' and something similar to a central institution through the miners? I mean I can send money from myself to someone else, but without miners confirming the transaction it doesn't really exist. Like how a bank has to confirm a transaction.
I understand it is more decentralized and takes it out of the hands of small group of people, and that anyone can become a miner and confirm hashes. But from the little I've seen there are still larger mining operations that do a large portion of the heavy lifting that could be construed as 'the banks.' At least to a layman.

What are the fees usually like? Or where are you trading that you have lots of fees?
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:16:48
I'm sure it will, but that was still a big drop for those people and I'm crossing my fingers that it goes down more.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:02:01
Yep. They could just make the dive worse if they get spooked on other cryptos. But it seems to be swinging backup. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:07:42
When you say "short" what do you mean exactly? Do people sell BTC options?
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:47:19
This makes sense. I don't think my bank would like it if they were getting weird withdrawals and deposits. I can't imagine the exchanges would flag though, just because this is to be expected. Buying on one exchange and selling on another.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:47:37
God I laughed at this. Thinking about getting into bitcoin and this is my worse nightmare. lol
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:53:33
I guess that's true. It just seemed like a really smart thing to do. Depends on the trade volume too though.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:21:08
I'm sure. I look at the history and go "Damn if I had purchased 20 coins back when it was at $500 I would have made a killing." Like most people i'm a great hindsight investor. ;)
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:14:59
I was wondering this myself.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:21:37
I'm at work now so I can't. I'll have to set it up and wait for another dip. If angry Koreans decide to sell when the markets aren't suspended anymore we may see another drop.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:27:11
What about bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:23:16
I was considering getting in the morning it dropped and i'm glad I didn't. Wife would have been pissed at me. 
Why do people think BTC will be great over the long run? I've been researching BTC as well as Blockchain in general, but haven't seen why people think it is only going up.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:03:45
Sure does. I just saw the 8%-9% percent arbitrage and was like "i wish I had like 10k laying around to make some quick money." But I realize that I'm not that smart and if the markets are flattening out there must be a reason people smarter than I are not taking a lot of advantage.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:22:58
I would if I could. I was thinking about buying this morning at $2700. Glad I waited or my wife would have been super pissed.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:14:00
Risk aversion. Not understanding the tech and how it can be useful in further applications. Hell I've been looking into it and still don't understand it.
I heard about BTC floating around for the past several years, but never took time to look into it. Wasn't until this last bubble that I noticed it. (I like watching volatile investments occasionally) 
The risk involved can be large depending on when you get in. Plus for a lot of people like me it can be hard to say "I'm going to invest a little at a time and in 15 years I will be worth a lot." That's why most people hand their money to an investor who promises 2-8% return. Easier and less risky.
The volatility also scares people. It jumps up 100% in a month and drops 30% in a day. Even if the long term trend is up that REALLY freaks a lot of people out. We are quite emotional creatures, especially when it comes to money, which in most cases people have literally traded their lives (time they will be alive) for it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:26:42
Demand in those markets. Fees perhaps?
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:59:41
This is what I use: 
It will aggregate a bunch of them together and you can see what they are trading for on individual exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:00:16
Just hoping the other currencies hodl too. It's not just bitcoin that's down. So if the others get spooked it could cause more problems.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:03:27
I think that's because Poloniex only trades in altcoins to BTC. I was referring Bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:07:55
Damn man that sucks. I was looking into getting into it today too. Glad I missed this mess.
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:20:02
I don't know if I'd say your over invested. Even if you invested $100 watching it drop ~25% never feels good. Especially when first getting in the game.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:09:05
Nvm just looked it up. Pretty smart idea right now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:49:27
So much for the instant transaction times with Bitcoin. The system can't keep up with all the hype. And this volatility. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:15:15
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:04:42
That sounds so nice. Do they even need an account in both places? I'm not really sure how that works since Bitcoin is virtual couldn't they just trade it on the same exchange that it's going for $2800?
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:46:28
Probably not. I imagine these things usually work like IPOs where the new coins are pitched to investors with large reserves and then later opened to the market.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:37:30
I've been securing my accounts today trying to prepare in advance. How do I remove the phone recovery? I have it set to 2FA with text recovery. Do you have a link to a guide?
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:48:02
I have every intention to diversify more. I'm just starting with Altcoins. Starting really small. This is more of a fun past time, with the potential for some returns than a full fledged investment strategy. I intend to have an IRA and probably a stock/ETF account. This is just another place to invest.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:56:51
I'm confused. How can I have 2 factor authentication if there is nothing else for it to authenticate?
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:53:47
Unfortunately this is pretty expensive in comparison to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:28:06
When I googled it there was something stating that Bitcoin is treated to a 15% property tax instead of the capital gains tax. But I'd google it for yourself. And with that much money get an accountant or tax lawyer. I'm sure the government would just love to come and tell you you didn't pay enough.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:45:49
You could just do it yourself. Just make an excel spreadsheet and monitor it on your own. I did that with $100 just to see how it went.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:39:28
I feel like this is true of all currency, including cryptocurrency. Nothing has any real value. Only what we as people place on it. So BTC is really high right now, but something else could come along and draw value away from it. Even gold, silver, or land don't have any real value. 
Something is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:45:56
Ok good. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't missing some crucial piece of valuation information when deciding where to invest.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:49:57
I actually think investors are jumping between BTC and ETH more. So even if BTC tanks, I could still potentially trade against ETH and be in a good spot. 
It's really hard to ignore the kind of growth BTC has had. I don't really see a reason not to invest. With how much it's gone up it looks relatively low risk in the long term. I also don't intend to GO ALL IN RIGHT NOW!!!! Just gonna invest a little every month and build up from there.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:42:10
This is really good advice. I was looking at DGB, Bytecoin, and just plain Bitcoin. I'll have to research and write up statements.
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:02:29
Gotcha, So you're just saying to use the app over the number. That was where my confusion was.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:30:53
Congrats man! I bought my first little bit a couple days ago. Already had an interesting ride. DGB for the win!
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:46:27
I was suggesting that how we value things is arbitrary and changes over time. I'm not suggesting we don't have currency. It is WAY better and more efficient than the alternative. I just felt like the article was arguing that Fiat currency didn't have REAL value and I was arguing that is true for everything.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:59:18
To set up 2FA requires a second code of some kind. The easiest way is for it to send a code to your phone. Or use the authentication app. So how can I have it on, yet not use my phone to get a code/verify? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:10:16
Thats why I plan to invest in Altcoin. Diversify through the more popular coins so it appreciates against BTC and ETH.
