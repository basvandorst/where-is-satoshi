a theoretically endlessly long ledger of transactions is no chill. Especially with traders entering the picture, scalping away, completing millions of useless transactions. 
I don't know how many people have copies of the blockchain, but just the upkeep of all of them is worrisome (so many hard-drives and datacenters...)

the year in which block height approaches ~6.93mil 
found a [source]( that estimates this at around year 2140 (someone also mentioned this in comments)

that just means the blocksize will have to increase. where's it at now? has it changed before? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:52:47
but approximately how large will the blockchain get by that time? I get how it will continue to grow, but would I have go get a stack of hard-drives just to catch up?

Not exactly. By your analogy I'm asking in 2140 how large of a hard drive I need to store the entire history of bitcoin transactions since bitcoin began. 
(assuming the last of bitcoins will have been mined in like 120 years)
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:38:59
around the time the last coins are being mined...whenever that happens

The growth isn't linear, it's growing exponentially. next year it will be like 100GB, then 200, whatever...
