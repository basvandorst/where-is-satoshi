well, we don't know how much is his mortgage. Maybe he has an expensive house that can't be covered with what he got in cash atm. Also, he probably has most of his money invested or working in something, not sitting in a bank.

I've just realised it's the same guy posting 5 comments on this thread. Btw, when did you start buying BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:36:27
ah, I didn't know what Tether is. I saw USD'T' before and didn't look it up. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:52:32
Btw, it's cool that you made �� off bitcoin, may I ask how old you are now?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:41:31
yes, but he actually had to put a lot of effort into building the company. On the other hand, they just sat and waited, they didn't create the 1 billion dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:35
Too many edgy teenagers here just riding the trend
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:38:37
Exactly, so it will affect BTC since people will hedge using it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:14:27
Hey, slim!
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:43:33
lol wtf is that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:03:25
you know what I'm saying
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:05:10
that's not what I said, you fucking moron.. holy shit. I don't know the effect it will have on the price, but it WILL have an effect.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:43:40
ain't got time for dat, man. Those high school kids are serving us by pumping the price up, buying coins with their lunch money. Let them have their hype and memes.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:21
same, but I do that with a lot of movies. I find most of them boring af
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:49:11
It matters because if you don't pay in time, it keeps building up. You can also pay early and save interest money.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:42:10
How much did you mine, bro? Are you a millionaire already?
Also, started what? Mining again? I think that's worthless now unless you can run an ASIC farm.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:33
I was just curious. Oh well, I should have noticed it's a corporate account anyway, so it's not personal investment.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:41:26
That's what I guessed and it's awesome. I think GDAX lets you pay the fee. Do you know about other exchanges? They usually mention "no fee" for BTC withdrawal but by that they mean "no fee on our side" but you still have to pay the BTC transaction fee to the miners.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:47:42
What if it's not a business loan tho
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:56:41
Instead what we have now is currency inflation (it's an intentional policy by central banks) and you get higher salary over time, but actually wages are effectively the same. We have more productivity now but earn the same (in "constant" dollars)
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:38:41
What if I lose other coins? You're only sorry for losing BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:45:39
If it's any technology then BTC is shit. There are many currencies with improved technologies. Ethereum is a whole new story.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:48:56
This shit happened to me yesterday.. I sold at 15400 EUR thinking it's going to get a little lower to 15000 EUR... NOPE, now it is at fucking 16900 EUR.. fml, I could have gained 400 EUR more, that's almost the price of a flight ticket that I "lost" in potential gain. I should have just HODLed or at least only sold half not all.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:00
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:09
It has indeed shot up to much more than 10k now. What made you think that's going to happen?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:05:20
Man, I got no work today and wanted something to watch. I'll watch that 
EDIT: nvm, couldn't even get through 30 mins of that garbage
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:37:15
Supply matters because trading large futures means you won't be able to hedge them using BTC since you'd need proportional amount of BTC. It doesn't matter if you don't hedge, but I think most professionals (and specially banks and market makers) do hedge.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:59:55
Rent? You mean interest?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:03:11
Not, it's literally not since it's a fixed amount that doesn't just keep compounding. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:40:17
You're the ones who are uneducated actually.
BTC will probably be used to hedge the risk of market making the future contracts. Banks and market makers will be trading BTC to offset the risk (hedge) of trading the contracts. This is typical practice.
Perhaps you shouldn't call others uneducated when you clearly have no knowledge in finance.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:29:14
You have much coins?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:26
What difference does it make? Withdrawing BTC means transferring to a wallet. A wallet is a wallet whether it's on an exchange or your pc or a physical device. It's the same transaction with the same fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:20:15


Well, apparently not since he thought he can cancel it. He should have known that the transaction has already been broadcasted to the network. You can't cancel it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:00:44
But I don't like them brothers. I won't support them.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:04:23
Very similar to each other
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:27:05
It's wrong because they CAN affect the thing itself (BTC). They will be buying/selling BTC to hedge their bets (i.e. limit their potential losses) since the future price is tied to BTC price. You cannot do that with sports.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:27:52
that doesn't matter tho, does it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:23:05
may I ask you how old are you and is that money you're fine with losing most of it is it a substantial % of your net worth?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:57
What is it that has long transfer times and verification process? You mean generally with other exchanges compared to using the simple Coinbase app? Also, how did you find this thread? I thought the mods removed it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:00:03
Wrong analogy
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:16
that's impossible because I moved all of my coins. You can't take away from a balance of 0. I received the exact same amount.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:02:24
Well, how much did you buy at 24$?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:30:15
You understand that the only way to transfer BTC is from a wallet to a wallet, right? That's literally how the system is designed. IMO you should read more about BTC before you put money into it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:01:04
They trade BTC to "hedge their risk". You'll have to look that up if you don't know what it means.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:53:19
Yes, including Moses and Jesus. They're all recognised as prophets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:30:41
that must be it, new people coming in, they enter through coinbase app
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:48:33
Those three religions came from close places all in the Middle East. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:04:53
you made 30 millions from bitcoin? lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:49:00
There's no way you made enough to retire. Even if you had bought 10k worth, it would be 250k now. That's not enough to not work again. A house alone costs more than that.
Edit: just read you're from Eastern Europe, makes sense now. Life is cheaper there
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:52:13
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:31:07
so it's a company trading coins?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:28:50
Your fault, Trezor wallet shows you exactly how much you're paying in fees and lets you change it. It even shows you how many bytes are being sent so that you can see why the fee is higher if you send more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:42
Your username tho, at least he was right about that
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:32:17
Ha, I dreamt it will reach 17k back when it was about 10k
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:44
Why would it be prohibited in the first place?
