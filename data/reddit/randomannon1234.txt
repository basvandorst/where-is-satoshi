Yea, you don't understand cryptography. There are signature based attacks you could on bitcoin. While these attacks are complex and would probably not be feasible by a small group. It isn't out of the realm of possibilities for a nation state. As far as shutting down the communications, I don't think that is feasible since bitcoin is at a CDN level. The bigger threat would be legislation to block cryptocurrencies altogether.

So what you do is steal the private keys of users or you get issued private keys that should belong to the user. This is far from impossible.

That's a good question, China is making moves with the miners, let's see what they do.
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:21:09
This won't scale unfortunately I get the idea though. You could use IPSEC which would scale.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:06:00
Yea Crypto isn't quite there yet in my eyes. I wonder how hard a recession would hit bitcoin. No trolling, I really think it could hit $0. What do you think it would go to in this recession scenario?

Did you not even read my comment?

Well I actually learned a lot from some of the users. I got my mission accomplished. Some people's analysis that bitcoin would drop to 3k is might be a correct belief. The problem with the bitcoin community I feel like is that you can't have these crucial conversations with them. It feels like you are talking to a lot of conspiracy nut jobs that don't know what they are talking about. For example, look at how many say I don't understand bitcoin... I'm actually a highly paid security engineer with 12 years of experience. I understand bitcoin at a level that most the people posting will never understand.  
I want to talk to people who accurately understand the problems of cryptocurriences and can discuss them intelligently.

Well condensing  asshole,let's talk about dollar cost averaging on a single asset. For instance, what happens if you do dollar cost averaging, on gold. Your returns would be about 1%. Dollar cost averaging != perfect investment strategy.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:54:15
So I think it will, and precious metals are hardly ever used when a currency implodes.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:16:37
So what do you think will happen? Like I said this isn't to troll, this is a real conversation.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:42:30
That seems reasonable thank you for your opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:16:11
absolutely nothing
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:36:35
I'm curious as well. This is how I think I could make a decent return on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:30:22
mostly ease of use, transactions take too long right now to ever be practical. There are also problems with the price manipulation which you can argue happens with fiat but not to the scale of bitcoin.  It also has a huge scaling problem.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:34:08
Yea, that's my problem. I don't know if bitcoin can solve some of the fundamental problems it has. For example, if I create RandomCoin and it fixes these issues, bitcoin becomes useless.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:11:28
I looked at some of your posts you just attack people all time. You seem to be a very angry person. If you actually took the time to talk to me you might find out I don't disagree with you on everything.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:53:30
That's fair. Thanks for your insight.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:40:19
Sorry was at work, a nonce is a number only used once. It is used most commonly to prevent replay attacks.  I commonly use it in creating unidirectional IPSEC tunnels using IKEv1. This exchange in this scenario would happen in what's called Main Mode. The nonce per RFC 2409, it's 8 to 256 bytes long, the length specified in the diffie-helman exchange in main mode. This is a more practical use of a nonce. Bitcoin uses it as a proof of work concept. Since the nonce should only be used once, any other number would change it's hash so a block being presented with a correct nonce would in theory show a proof of work.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:25:20
I disagree with the stock to flow idea. For example, what if it takes $20,000 of electricity to make a widget. Is that widget worth $20,000? The real value I see in any crypto at the current moment is what I call the Bob and Alice problem. Bob wants to send Alice 100,000,000 dollars across the world and ensure it gets to her. This has to go through the SWIFT network, lots of banks involved, huge fees. However, if Bob and Alice are part of a community that says a widget is worth $100,000 and you can send the widgets electronically and retrieve them for $$$$ later... the fees are minimum, the regulation is out of the way. This is where I think that cryptos have value. Forget the buzzwords like blockchain, that kind of transaction is amazing.
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:26:54
Interesting opinion, you might be right.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:37:01
I said it survived, I didn't say how well lol. The U.S. government has 22.8 trillion per the U.S. debt clock. It is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government now you are right that you can't exchange it for gold for example in a bank because it is a fiat currency. I am more interested in what you think will happen in this recession scenario. In this scenario, people will still accept U.S. dollars, bitcoin is not widely used as a currency so you will most likely have to sell some to make ends meet until the economy recovers. What do you think that would do for the price?
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:55:25
Agreed that's why I'm well diversified. I don't bitcoin is the answer though. I see so many flaws with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:41:10
I have and most cases they just reissue a currency, they don't switch to precious metals even believe it or not.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:22:29
Also negative interest rates scare the crap out of me. I don't know where to turn because so many central banks are doing it out once.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:12:36
Right but the U.S. Dollar has been survived since 1776. It is backed by the full faith of the U.S. government.
@_date: 2019-10-25 21:37:03
Actually this solves most of the bigger scaling issues pretty interesting. I haven't checked the lightning network out.  I have some homework to do.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:14:23
I personally don't think bitcoin will make it to 2032. I also think a recession will happen at least in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:10:41
Yea so that's what I'm getting at, this would cause a lot of downward pressure on bitcoin. I explain the cascading effects of a recession on exchanging cryptos for USD in my original post. It would cause bitcoin to fall significantly in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:30:10
That's not how that works, feel free to think what you want.  I would show you my resume and my linkedin to show you my references but I have a feeling you are a little bit crazy and would stalk me. If you read my other posts to more rational posters you will find out why I don't like bitcoin by the way.
Edit: I will try to explain to you where you are wrong on this assertion.
So let's do this the long way, so you have the previous hash, time stamp, TX root, and a nonce  that is all put together to create a hash. Notice how I said this before. " Since the nonce should only be used once, any other number would change it's hash so a block being presented with a correct nonce would in theory show a proof of work. " So not only did I show the use of a Nonce in another application, but also the use of it in Bitcoin. Notice how the Nonce has nothing to do with the difficulty level? It's literally just a number used once.

Who said I was rich? I'm a long time investor, I've made hundreds of thousands of dollars but I'm far from rich. When you disagree with people do you always do personal attacks? Do you ever even try to have a meaningful conversation?
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:58:17
Exactly what I've done, the big problem with bitcoin is most people even those who think they understand it actually don't. I would love to discuss elliptical curve diffie helman or just basic PKI with bitcoin lovers but most can't hold a decent conversation on the matter.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:50:48
Let's talk about the key problem with bitcoin though. This is a common problem security engineers face by the way. What happens when your private key is stolen? In the normal scenario, you just get rid of the old certificate do a CSR, get a new certificate. What happens in the bitcoin scenario? You can lose everything, at least in the fiat system in the case of fraud you are protected.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:15:40
Instead of calling names, why not have a discussion? So let's say you need food, real food, go to walmart and say I want to pay in bitcoin. You will go hungry. Most little stores won't let you pay with bitcoin. Some will most won't, but everyone will accept U.S. dollars.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:32:32
How far do you think the downward pressure would bring it? I personally believe the bitcoin believers are right about the devaluation. My play against that is real estate though.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:02:48
I'm not super wealthy but I'm doing pretty well for myself. I like how instead of using a real argument you resort to name calling.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:07:28
Yea my big thing is I don't have faith in cryptos yet. As a security engineer, I see sooooo many flaws with the logic of bitcoin. I think it's a good first pass, but I see something like a dotcom bubble. What a lot of people don't seem to realize when I say that analogy is that Amazon and Microsoft survived the dotcom bubble.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:41:43
So you think the whole U.S. economy would switch to a bartering system?
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:12:21
A *store of value* is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. .
I argue bitcoin isn't predictably useful and isn't a store of value. It's been around since 2009 and hasn't been through a major economic downturn. Silver on the other hand has many manufacturing uses. I don't know if you understand what a store of value is.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:18:42
Really? Would you like to discuss asymmetric key algorithms, TLS implementations, and PKI in great detail? I bet you couldn't. A lot of people think they understand how bitcoin works but really have no clue about the underlying technology. As far as money and currency, I'm not the own saying that the biggest economic power in the whole world is going to crash into oblivion and some "Decentralized" crypto is going to take over.... but like I said, when crypto believers get in corners all they do is insult.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:40:15
There really isn't much security in the network. There are now active CVEs bitcoin is not nearly as secure as many people think it is. So when hyper inflation at that scale has happened in the past the world has never gone to even a precious metal hints I don't buy precious metals. It has issued another currency instead, see Germany in the 1930s. I personally am buying real estate.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:47:20
I'm not here to corect people's spelling, see what I did there :).  So that being said, why do you think bitcoin would be a better choice vs let's say real estate.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:55:15
Assume - making an ass out of you and me.
I'm a Security Engineer with 12 years of experience with a specialization in TLS and cryptography. I have a deeper understanding of how bitcoin works then most people will ever be able to comprehend. That's why I see major problems with it. If you want to do a deep dive in key exchange protocols along with different replay attacks, stream vs block ciphers, let me know.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:57:02
You make a solid argument, I counter that bitcoin won't keep gaining users if it takes a significant hit in the future. The people who have money obviously won't sell if they truly believe in bitcoin but most americans live paycheck to paycheck. I'm overgeneralizing a bit but I see this happening.
@_date: 2019-10-24 20:56:42
very interesting take and advice. I have some real estate properties to offset hyper inflation. What I'm worried about is the dollar becoming so inflated I can't trade it for other currencies. If I have to get the hell out of dodge, I can trade my bitcoin for euros for example. I would like to talk to you more offline since you don't seem to be one of the craziest like  I want to tell you my valid concerns without people losing their shit.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:03:44
Do you have a lot of money in crypto? I'm thinking about starting small maybe 25k to 50k?
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:01:08
If you actually invested, you would do actual investments, You would know that dollar cost average usually returns much lower, but you are probably one of those people that knows everything.
@_date: 2019-10-11 02:28:28
That's true, but I would argue that was because that was due to the increase in popularity of bitcoin becoming mainstream. As far as those economies, you still had to pay for food and goods in Euros and bolivar. That being said, I could see a scenario where it goes up. That scenario involves a massive bank run, it's very unlikely but can happen.
@_date: 2019-10-24 21:19:57
Interesting, I'm thinking of jumping in now because I see a discount on BTC. The google quantum supremacy article was just a bunch of hype and I think it scared people away. Did that article even phase you?
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:04:52
Have you noticed that when bitcoin supporters can't make a decent argument they go to name calling? Look at how I responded to some of these comments, one person presented their argument very well and provided proof for their opinions. I said thank you for your opinion, I think that's anything but trolling.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:28:41
There are several but one of the biggest is the time it takes to do a transaction.
@_date: 2019-10-11 03:45:51
Lol at least you see where I was going with the widget idea, I guess in 2140 we will know the answer.
