You promise to build a secure and anonymous browser. As far as I can see from your website the software is closed-source. How do you ensure that your browser has the same level of security tor provides? Is the information in the cloud only available to the user (as in [client-side encryption]( or do you store it in such a way that you have access to the data?
In the latter case it would only guarantee as much security as Lavabit was able to.

You want to give money to your best friend Bob (eg for buying Lollipops) but you do not want your parents to know that you did (they do not like Bob).
Your friend Carol offers to take the money and give it to Bob. And she offers to to this for many friends at once so that none of the parents know where the money went.
Now you give the money to Carol and the next day you hear from Bob that he only received half of the money you gave to Carol. That’s mean!
You try to tell everyone that they should not trust Carol because she took your money, but nobody believes you! Everyone likes Carol and you have nothing to convince them.
Let’s go back in time. You want to give money to your friend Bob and you go to Carol. This time you give her the money but you also require her to write her name on a piece of paper where you both wrote down the amount of money you want to send.
If Carol decides to steal from you now, you just show this to everyone and they will believe you since they know how the handwriting of Carol.
(I hope this is ELI5 enough ;))
