This is related to the bitcoin blockchain &amp; services also.

Artists have managers &amp; agents that advise them and want a cut. It’s not really ha-ha Lilly.

Or a broker can be found on local bitcoins, bittylicious or bit bargain. Your digital asset manager may be able to help you get more if you have one.

Thanks. When will segwit cease to be optional on the chain?

He could ruin bitcoin if he wanted but it would cost him.

No. One site renaming BTC at this point without consensus will just cause confusion. BTC has been the ticket since conception with the exception of XBT.

People can copy open source code as much as they like, there's only one peer-to-peer electronic cash original and that's bitcoin (BTC).

And segwit

Shame he feels so negatively about bitcoin 'mirage'

You think ethereum is a shitty altcoin? ��

Not scheduled until 25/11 tho? No replay protection yet.

Don't worry about little dips and waves if you're holding long term, even if it dropped 40% in value I wouldn't sell because someone will be waiting or manipulating to buy more. Unless there was a fault and all the companies involved in bitcoin started going bust then it's just beginning ����

ASIC mining also make the chain more secure and desired. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:28:34
For ripple perhaps but a distributed ledger which provides an incentive based reward for securing the network is a little more complex than a database. 
Yes there is a ledger which is this public record you speak of however you're not accounting the hashing required to mine new coins to apply to the network.

Be wary of manipulation making you feel like the ship is sinking just before it actually takes off and flys.

Coinbase will be fine. It depends where you are in the world, you could consider bitfinex or bitstamp for your exchange needs but coinbase will give you immediate access. If you use something like uphold.com consider transferring to somewhere that'll support both chains.

Bit more than just a database. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:08:51
Can you qualify this statement?
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:52:01
Awful, should help users have both BTC &amp; BCH as a market leader and assist with the turbulence.

Would it be just an AI or a full blown android?
