The one problem with this is it would create an echo chamber of sorts. I do like to see a lot of opinions and debate. Removing all of the bear opinions could make this a even bigger pool of I am mostly just playing devils advocate though. I would like to see more rational bearish opinions.

I know an overheated market when I see one. All I knew is I was in one and to get out and wait for it to come down. 
Yes I was worried I would kick myself and it would be +400 but I knew it wasn't sustainable and got out. Nothing lucky about that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:41:17
This is what pisses me off. I guess if you tip stupid posts on reddit you don't deserve your money anyway. Still makes me mad.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:39:21
If only OP could make an advice animal out of it. Then we upvote.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:34:51
Please tell me you don't believe this.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:36:26
This is what I was thinking. The remainders could get nasty but it must be do able. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:56:11
I didn't get my start in a large firm. I literally walked in off of the street. The pay is not awful. The pay is actually pretty extreme for any job remotely similar. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:41:10
Haha yes sir. I would BC tip if I knew how and had any BC.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:39:31
OP barely used that account. Like 10 posts prior to this. He was full of shit.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:11:48
This transaction would not get processed without a call from the bank. It sets off too many flags. Unusual activity over 10k will be scrutinized heavily. For fraud and money laundering.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:36:36
That is why I used it to describe the firm. ..buddy.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:34:54
The sheep are the only ones who base their buy on what the market is. You base your buy on what you think it is worth not what some has an ask order for.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:38:24
It's hard enough to time a market without all of this emotional "I believe in bitcoin" stuff going around.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:34:46
Nooo that is horrible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:50:46
Keep repeating that mantra to yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:35:12
No one knows, Hype probably.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:32:39
They should allow you to make an offer at less than market value. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:42:17
Make sure to have them train their replacements before they go.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:12:09
I like Doctors without Borders. Great cause most of the money actually goes to giving aid. Not logistics, advertising or management fees. Here is a great way to evaluate where you should donate. 
EDIT: Doctors Without Borders also sends a lot of junk mail. But they allow you to opt out or lower the amount if you want.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:21:04


Is idiocy of the highest order. So if you don't spend...what happens? You save. I hope you aren't allowed outdoors sans helmet.

Yeah I was speaking to the Spartans who will be holding their own units for a while. (By units I mean penis' if that wasn't clear)
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:37:15
OP is full of shit and is working an angle. BEWARE! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:23:32
I have been wondering if MT Gox isn't creating some cover for some investors to exit gracefully. I have no proof but conspiracy theories are fun.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:13:28
You believe in a currency? That is moronic. Why don't you just use it to make shady purchases like the rest of us.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:45:46
If you are in finance you aren't poor. It doesn't happen. I work at the MSP for every possible size financial firm you can think of. I am also a CIMA and I know for a fact no one. NO ONE is asking about weird alt investments even to senior members. This is either a scam or fan fiction. Fuck you.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:48:33
So you are selling right now?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:55:08

Yeah. No it didn't. What do you do again?
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:26:23
Do do /snicker
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:24:45
By pillaging Bitlandia and raping it's women of course.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:23:33
You are correct.
edit: OP is working an angle or trying to scam. BEWARE
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:52:46
This is a very beta statement.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:12:43
If you cashed out at 200+ you could have bought in now and believed even more.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:23:05
My guess is around 10$ 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:04:26
I buy from MT. Gox. I don't really buy for speculation either just SR purchases. I have not had any problems yet with them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:07:50
A good start?
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:54:59
He does debate. He did so last month. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:10:19
Yes that is weird. Have you had any experience with them?
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:47:35

@_date: 2013-04-13 20:42:19
Some people don't think so. Those are lambs to the slaughter in my humble opinion. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:28:27
Perfect. This is almost exactly how I felt. And made good cash money!
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:18:04
Won't be the first time. And the day isn't over yet.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:10:08
Just to clarify what you are asking. Are you asking if you start accepting bitcoin would it bring you more clients? If that is your question. No not really. However, I am no marketing wizard and live in Florida not California. Maybe having the bitcoin logo might make you look more advanced and cooler to your market? I don't know. Most people in bitcoin right now are not getting the sex (if you know what I mean).
 
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:38:15
Its not the value of the coins that matters. It's what they are worth that gets him excited. -wordsoup
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:53:55
This is going to get scary. Obviously I could be wrong. I am pretty sure things are about to get really bad.
Disclosure: I am out of BTC 100% and would buy if it dropped to a reasonable price FWIW

If you define luck by weighing the pro's and con's then making a decision based on the risk level you are comfortable with then yeah, luck.

Panic is what happened.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:00:36
What does believing in the concept have anything to do with selling or buying? I use Bitcoin to buy things. I only had Bitcoin from some leftover purchases. When I realized they were over 200 I sold them all. Why on earth would you not sell?
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:57:31
Haha yeah. I don't know exactly when he did it but I bet you can sync it when bitcoinbillionaire went gonzo.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:37:24
I have been watching these past couple of days just shaking my head. The "HOLD!" meme that was frontpage during the crash is what pushed it over the edge for me.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:39:52
Thanks for this. The printing press analogy is flawed as well.
@_date: 2013-05-19 18:21:42
Thanks for this response. I did exactly this and ran with my Gorun2s' all week with em and thanks to BitCoin.

Nah I'll keep my fascist fiat for the time being. :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:54:07
The difference is we made money with our prediction. Good luck with your death-pool though.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:32:56
Will be interesting for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:27:46
This is panic.
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:56:54
Yeah good idea buy it on it's slide downward. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:34:54
Very interesting. I am glad I don't have a margin available. It's nice to sit back and watch with no position. I would be crapping my pants nonstop if I could have it both ways.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:47:20
Annnd he shit on it. :P
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:21:01
Shit on Deborahs desk! Fuck a giant fish.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:51:52
I am upset. Because op is either lying or scamming. This shit does not happen. If you were even close to finance you would know how stupid this story is. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:01:06
Wow. This is the second time I have been blown away by the retarded thinking of this redditor.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:28:09
You do realize this crash is going on with or without the lag. The lag is likely slowing the inevitable not hastening.  
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:54:12
Mt Gox is flawed but it is the best we have at the moment. Hasn't let me down yet. I have been able to sell and buy at it's highest volumes. Except when it goes down it is reliable and safe.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:06:25

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:40:48
I think we have yet to reach the floor. Once we do you will know. It will go up and down quickly for the next week. Once it truly bottoms out you will have ample time to evaluate any position.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:20:56
Oh snap shit just got real. Love my arduinos and RasPi have fun.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:42:35
You are thinking rationally. I am more ~~bullish~~ a bear on the value. I am thinking 9-10$ range. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:52:37
They seriously need to get their shit together. Nothing better than some XSS attack while all this shit is going down. 
EDIT: their  is what's borked
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:17:35
I don't think so. Not anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:09:32
WOW! So here it is folks. This dude uses the financial trading platform and rips off a broker/dealer any  finacial firm may use as some way to earn credibility. Even though it is in not germane to the discussion. You decide scammer or liar. The moron part is not up for debate. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:05:33
Why would you average yourself while you know it is on a downward slide? You do not have to be beholden to the cost average at all cost. You are allowed to use your own judgement. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:21:24
Yeah...this didn't happen.
@_date: 2013-04-14 23:32:41
It's speculation. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:06:47
It wasn't easy to decide to sell while all of the idiots in this forum were yelling to "HOLD/SPARTANS!". Call that luck or whatever but I call it a hard decision.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:25:12
buy some more if they are so great. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:27:31
You are worried about an hourly paycheck? Yeah not in finance.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:47:38
Wow that's awesome way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:59:58
I'm posting here to come back to later. This is rich.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:18:13
I doubt they are allowing ICMP traffic.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:48:05
If you find too exciting try or some warm milk and a nap.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:42:10
I doubt it.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:43:20
People think about how they buy from the wrong angle. I just ask myself if I think it is worth it to me. I think it is overvalued personally. When I sell I am usually surprised anyone would buy at that price. When I buy I am shocked I could get it so cheap. I trade based on what I think it is worth to me. You can make money off of the suckers I'm sure. I just don't know how to do that without becoming one.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:16:39
if any do have a wife or girlfriend they have been conned out of their lifesavings to buy BTC at 250 and won't be fucking you anytime in the near ever.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:13:57
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:39:39
Couldn't agree more. People really shouldn't be buying while mtgox is actively restricting sellers from fully cashing out.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:43:47
This probably seemed funnier in your head. Very few people are saying bitcoin is dead or dying. Some (like myself) just think it's overvalued.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:22:28
So you do know these "meetings" you speak of don't actually happen right. No one is inviting a junior anything into a meeting like this. It's only meetings about which Muni's to sell. This is idiotic garbage people see in movies. You are full of shit.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:09:40
They have been filtering ICMP since at least 3 days ago. Why on earth would you not be filtering ICMP if you were MTGox?
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:22:49
You know as much as anyone else does. If it were me I would sell here. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:58:11
I was hesitant about them but talked to service and she said it was basically instant. No need to wait for an actual card :)
Edit: I am going to try it now...and go to FootLocker as well! Hahah besties now. Which ones did you get so we can look like twins.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:02:10
I used to be buy at $15-20. I might be more of a $40 guy now(due to all of the press). I still think the true bottom will be obvious so I am not really worried. I think when MTGox comes back to life I will place a buy at $30.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:38:39
Next you're going to tell me my copy of electric boogaloo is worthless.
@_date: 2013-04-16 15:18:23
It will drop again tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:30:24
Do you think it is worth $93 dollars a coin? If yes then buy. Else
don't buy
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:57:48
So now you have a progressive firm? Which is it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:53:59
There are a ton of investment ideas that happen that have nothing to do with the wholesale market. None involve junior level sales people. You watch too many movies.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:49:39
That is exactly what it is!
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:43
This is how you slowly land a crash folks. They are giving the big guys a chance to cash out. See you at the bottom.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:29:02
Oh awesome! All of the bad advice of without all of those funny memes! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:05:12
Well said. You have to look at SR for the true believers. They are the only ones dying for this to stop so they can get back to business as usual.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:30:10
No one knows. You have to ask yourself if the value is there right now or not. Is it hype or is that really he value of this coin. I have not seen a good argument why it should be so expensive all of a sudden. You might think otherwise. All you have to go on is your own judgement. Is it overvalued right now or undervalued?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:17:24
I was thinking $10 but probably would have bought in at $20 and held for a while. Until the next spike at least.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:07:02
He has a point. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:39:25
Nothing in the history of ever looks like that.
