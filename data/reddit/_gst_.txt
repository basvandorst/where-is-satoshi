Didn't have any coins stolen, but got an email from Blockchain notifying me that someone tried to access my account. I created this wallet years ago and this didn't happen before:

Many European debit cards are Maestro cards instead of Visa or Mastercard cards. While Maestro belongs to Mastercard, you can't use these cards online like a regular US debit card or credit card.
In addition, credit cards aren't that useful in Europe as you usually need to pay an annual fee and as you usually can't keep a balance (you need to pay the full amount each month). So unless you need them for online transactions or traveling just using a debit card is often the easier option.

A negative balance is also possible with Bitcoins if you use Coinbase: 
I wonder if they fixed their race condition by now.

If a large number of buyers and sellers start to use Coinbase, then Coinbase won't need the network anymore. Instead it will be the new Paypal.

I'm glad if companies find a Bitcoin related business model that works for them, but I don't expect them to contribute to Bitcoin.

Linking the account works fine, but I didn't find a way to unlink the account. It's possible to deauthorize USAA in the Coinbase interface, but USAA still continues showing those Coinbase accounts.

Considering you also get a 2% discount on credit card payments (e.g., the Citi Doublecash card) it's easier to directly pay with credit card.

"sold out" -&gt; Coinbase is a commercial company that needs to make money for its investors. Of course it's going to prioritize the business over the Bitcoin community. I don't see anything wrong with that.

image you have a timelocked transaction that you can redeem (with a certain script) in x blocks from now.
adding replay protection would lock you out of your funds on the forked chain.

Actually I would like to avoid a PoW change, but I think being prepared for a PoW change is important to keep miners honest.
Reasons against a PoW change if possible: Bitcoin ASICs will be dirt-cheap to produce in the long-term. Maybe the electric heater that you buy in a few years from now does Bitcoin mining in the background, because using ASICs for heating isn't much more expensive than a regular heater. This would be the ultimate decentralization, as everyone would be mining Bitcoins without paying for mining. But if you switch to memory-hard ASIC-resistant algorithms this will become much more difficult, as suddenly the mining hardware is more expensive.

There's a reason why poor people are poor. I've seen these stories often enough: Someone is poor and gets an inheritance, and then uses all the money on cars and a new apartment. Once the money runs out they're doing even worse than before, because they're back to their old income, but monthly costs (maintenance, insurance, etc.) are now much higher than before.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:59:37
I wouldn't call it a niche issue. I'd expect forks of the chain to not arbitrarily invalidate previously valid transactions. otherwise that would equal seizure of funds which is an absolute no-go.
Yes: Not adding mandatory replay protection leads to ugly consequences. but that's why participants should try to find a consensus before taking such radical steps.
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:51:53
This PoW change would only get (manually) activated if no hashpower is mining the old chain. E.g., there are no blocks at all for a few days.
Of course the miners could start mining again right afterwards, but two chains are still better than zero chains.

Looks like they're still using MongoDB. I once had a case where their webserver was slow while I was withdrawing Bitcoins to an external address and so I started another withdraw request in a new Tab. What happened was that they sent me those Bitcoins twice, leaving me with a negative Bitcoin balance on the account. This type of error is the textbook example of why you need proper database transactions and it appears that they still don't manage to do this correctly.

WP is fine but running your blog on the same server as your Bitcoin processing backend is just stupid. An attacker with full access to the blog shouldn't be able to get access to any other parts of the system.

The low/negative interest rates are the reason for the current asset bubble that we're seeing. When interest rates are low people start buying more stock, housing, gold, ...
Unfortunately Bitcoin is no exception here. Expect further low rates to increase its value and future higher rates to decrease its value.
@_date: 2016-02-11 06:42:02
I wouldn't be surprised. The other altcoins do the same.

then your money is gone for now. theoretically you could get it with the help of a cooperating miner so not all hope is lost yet. wouldn't be surprised if one of the miners soon offers a service that retrieves stuck coins against a fee.

Bitcoin's Back: 
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:50:41
how's about rolling this out in a segwit like election: either segwit gets activated at the end of the last activation period (= softfork) or (if miners don't vote for it) it still gets activated on a hardforked chain that uses another pow.
should put more pressure on miners than just a simple UASF. with the UASF the worst outcome for them is segwit, with segwit-pow the worst outcome for them is the end of their business.
this approach would even be compatible with the current segwit election (so we don't need another round).

the quoted salary seems somewhat low - is this total comp? or do employees get equity in addition to base comp?
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:47:51
So what exactly is the issue you're talking about? The blocks are full - yes. But Bitcoin handles this situation just fine.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:23:55
this would have been right if there wouldn't have been the whole stalemate fiasco (segwit, blocksize, ...), causing most of the money to go into altcoins instead. instead of somehow finding consensus this community rather destroys itself...

Number one value: Diversification. I don't want to bet all of my crypto net worth on a single approach.
Other values:
* Highly centralized dev team that is able to work on cool tech without all the political issues (segwit, blocksize, etc. discussions) in the background.
* Company does enough lobbying and has enough banks as customers to make it less likely that their technology is outlawed in certain jurisdictions. While the Ethereum technology is also used by banks, they usually interact with a different private Ethereum chain. With Ripple there's a single chain used by everyone.
* Different approach to concensus. While definitely less decentralized than Bitcoin or Ethereum I think that this approach could also work if there are enough validators in different jurisdictions. Also it's probably the concensus approach most likely to be adapted by mainstream applications (bank, etc.).
* Basically instant transaction confirmations.
Also the main reason how I got into Bitcoin was that I was a user of the original centralized non-blockchain Ripple (which existed before Bitcoin and which nowadays lives at  and Bitcoin was mentioned early on in mailing lists discussing Ripple. So I'm always going to keep some XRP (and BTC) in my portfolio for nostalgic reasons, even when there are better technologies at some point.
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:52:45
The fact that sidechains are sharded doesn't only mean that they can be validated in parallel, but also means that these sidechain validations could be done by entities that are independent from the miner. Imagine some kind of "sidechain processing provider" from which the Bitcoin miner purchases the required sidechain information.
@_date: 2017-05-21 06:52:31
imo the on chain price is ok. we just need to enable segwit to allow the majority of transactions to be offline.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:50:49
a hardware wallet works for all of these use cases. good for long term storage. good for regular transactions. using a ledger nano s and it was the best investment in a while.

Blocksize is not really an issue for Ethereum, as the chain is very well suited for pruning. My Parity data directory currently uses 3.9 GB.


That's like saying "Bitcoin is basically a platform for online drug distribution". With a P2P network you can't choose which users are allowed to use it (which is a good think, if you want that feature use some centralized chain such as Ripple), so as soon as you have a significant number of users some of them are going to engage in questionable activities. Same with cash.

I asked this question a couple of times and _never_ got a technical answer. Segwit opponents are the anti-vaccers of the blockchain world.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If someone claims to be Satoshi it's up to him to show a proof for this - not the other way around.

what's the problem with extension blocks? looks like they are a superset of segwit and most (some?) of the miners would support them too.
@_date: 2016-05-20 13:19:24
That's an Advance-Fee scam: The check is going to bounce and you'll lose the original money you got plus the money you sent. Unfortunately transaction authentication can take a few weeks, so never return any money before that time.
Oh - one moment. Forgot that this is Bitcoin here. You'll be fine then.

Would be great if BU forked off, as it would immediately increase the percentage of the nodes signalling segwit.
