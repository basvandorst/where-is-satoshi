If this was what BCH was actually claiming, there wouldn't be as much of a problem. BCH is based on misinformation and is basically a scam. Sorry for the lack of an actual explanation, it's just sickening. 
Edit: BCH takes advantage of the fact that this entire space is hard to understand. 
Edit edit: actually, you asked a legitimate question, I shouldn't have given a bullshit response. My apologies. I just wouldn't trust BCH before doing a lot of research.

Okay I see the distinction there, thanks for the reply!

Right, I understand that news itself can have a huge affect, but do the futures exist on an exchange of their own whose price is averaged with the others? Or is it simply the news of people shorting that has a psychological effect on the price? (Thanks!)

Thanks, actually the part that I was getting is that it's meaningless, I guess I was wondering why it's used as an indicator at all  but it's probably the best indicator we have in the absence of actually being able to calculate how much money has actually been poured in.

Okay that makes some sense, thanks! Could you tell me what you mean by 'strike date?' Does bitcoin have to be eventually bought to fill the contract?

I get that, but I figured since price can jump around meaninglessly, using it to calculate market cap makes market cap vaguely accurate at best. Thanks for the reply though!

Thanks makes sense, I appreciate the reply!

Thanks for the real explanation. So it's an indicator but as far as a real calculation of how much has been invested, it's only a ball-park solution

Lol, point is market cap is useless and only a vague ballpark guess at best. In the absence of actually being able to calculate how much has been invested though, it's the best we can do

The best in my opinion is called "decentralization and the architecture of trust"
