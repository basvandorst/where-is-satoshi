Thank you.  When this was posted, BTC was sitting at 11200ish, so minus 70% puts it just a hair under the post 2017 low.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:23:45
I don’t think you should be prepared, I think you should pay your taxes.
@_date: 2019-07-21 05:55:48
Lambo time brah!!  I’m getting mine gold plated and stretched so I can fit hookers in the back and blow in the trunk!
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:38:53
Maybe, but not that I’m aware of. DYOR. 
The reality of the getting audited thing:  there’s maybe a 20% chance you get audited.  The IRS is pretty busy.  BUT do you want to risk it?  They wouldn’t just take the money you owe them.  Think jail time for a long time and legal fees that will eat every bit of whatever you had leftover in BTC gains.  
So...  how lucky you feeling?
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:38:42
Never say never but I think you’re probably close to right.  Maybe high sevens.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:42:52
-70% puts us back to pre-2017 levels.  Hoping you’re wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:33:46
You’d have to pay taxes on everything over the first ten.  You’d also need signed (and possibly notarized) notes that say the money was a gift.  Those people would then have to show that they had obtained the money legally and paid taxes on it.
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:53:45
Anyone who says otherwise is FUD

1.take PayPal
2.give to internet thingy
3.get crypto from inter webs 
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:00:20
By “dystopian invasion” do you mean, “I don’t want to pay my taxes?”
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:28:57
Just post all your banking info and we’ll take care of it
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:22:22
Well sure but successful day trading requires years of experience with markets and a keen sixth sense.  But yeah, it’s your money, have fun.
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:22:50
If you have to ask, dont try day trading.  Just hodl and stick to your day job.  Buy some more when it seems cheap and you have extra cash.

 Crypto kitties now has additional add-on stickers through kittyhats as well as a cool battle game through kitty battles!
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:51:34
Why are you in such a hurry?
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:00:06
Top row on that rainbow chart has been popped before.
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:00:20
Because the extra time is part of keeping it secure.  Learn yourself some underlying tech, bra. 
Why does liking to trade mean you have to be in a hurry?  Get your shit straight ahead of time.  Fucking amateur hour in here.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:25:21
The past is always a perfect prediction of the future!  Wtf guys...
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:03:26
I’m really curious to see the time frame this unfolds on.  Personally (and now I should disclose that I’m a strict hodler), I would bet that the run goes higher and lasts a couple months longer than you’re saying.
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:47:22
If BTC hits 100,000 that’ll be $8!   Ooooooo!!!  Ahhhhhh!!
@_date: 2019-02-14 04:25:08
You’re giving them a quarter?
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:21:21
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:34:39
Since we’re talking round numbers, why not 100k?
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:45:48
How is that an argument that it won’t exist?  
“ThInGs AlwaYS CHanGe OVeR TiMe!!!”
So like, the dollar won’t exist either right?  Because TIME.  Lol provide an actual argument or gtfo.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:35:33
So much this.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:46:26
The only thing?  Nah fam you can buy drugs.
@_date: 2019-04-24 07:41:24
The HOLDlers HODL.   It’s like, in the name.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:36:08
Agreed.  Either you believe in it or you don’t.

Anyone want to translate to tech-tard?
@_date: 2019-04-29 07:58:21
I see where you’re coming from, but something with a one in a trillion chance can still happen on the first throw...
Not a fan of his plan, just from the standpoint of, well, morality.

Some of those shitcoins are gonna be worth something.  I’m hanging on to my highly diversified shitcoin portfolio.  New investments: mostly in the top five market cap.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:52:48
I don’t know about “in a few months” but I agree that now is when we should be reinvesting.  I know most of these people gave into fomo and bought above $10000 and are understandably frustrated, but if it was a good investment at 10k, it’s an even better investment now.  Like, duh.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:55:10
Well, except for the exponential overgrowth of price.   Things have to consolidate for a long time to get confidence back into the market - similar to MtGox
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:43:27
About half as many as six months ago.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:57:00
It’s not a bad time to buy.  Could it go up - yes.  Could it go down - also yes.  But right now we’ve made it past the fomo that drove the last boom so it’s probably not going to loose half its value again.  Either way, think of this as a long term investment - it was three years between the last two booms and may be that long again.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:37:02
This is the time period when the market consolidates and the people with weak hands (like OP) sell to the people who always believed or are starting to see the light and are less freaked out by the decreases volatility.  
I say buy.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:53:57
It’s a placebo effect treatment for FUD lol

I sold all my BNB due to the US lockout of Binance and not wanting to deal with complications.  BUT I’d really like to get back on it because I believe in it.  Anyone have suggestions on how to get BNB now?
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:50:45
Thank you kind stranger.
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:24:06
@_date: 2019-09-17 17:15:28
Yeah, I know.  I really don’t want to get that deep into tech.  I’m an economist, not a techy.
@_date: 2019-09-17 18:43:55
Yeah, I don’t want to hide.  That’s not my goal.  I pay my taxes etc.  trying to be on the up and up.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:10:00
Dude, I will totally throw you a little BTC if you do this and post proof.
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:16:12
Until we start defaulting on our skyrocketing debt...
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:28:59
It’s all fake.  Call their bluff.  
Or, even better, respond that you have backtracked to their server and have installed Trojan programs and now have pictures of them pleasuring themselves to porn.  Threaten to share with all their family and friends, attempt to extort double what they originally asked.  
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:57:53
Yes and no.  The current Chinese strategy in Africa has been to loan money and then call the debt to seize assets.   Pretty sure they did it with a big port in Senegal. Might have my location wrong DYOR.
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:33:50
Why is nobody talking about it?  
Because, “Hey this guy who gets hit in the head for a living supports our technology” is only good if you make helmets.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:09:44
The alt wave starts when BTC gets high enough that investors start to sell off and diversify.  
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:17:48
Yeah, but China owns the majority of our massive debt and has way more soldiers so the “America is  and untouchable” routine is getting old too.
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:43:35
That’s cute.   
If America defaults on its China debt, its credit is fucked.  You think other countries are going to loan us money or want to do business with us?  Nope.  What do we do then?  Nuke everyone?
@_date: 2019-05-26 05:15:39
Shit, China owns enough debt to shut down the dollar in a week if they decide its in their interest.
@_date: 2019-05-26 07:17:24
Which is why it’s easier for them to own all our debt and then just collapse our economy and swoop in.  Classic Art of War strategy.
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:35:07
Uncertainty in traditional markets has made bitcoin a bit more attractive but I mostly agree with the other guy - crypto doesn’t care about trump.
