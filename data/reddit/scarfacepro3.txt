Hey I'm just sayin what we're all thinkin ;)
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:36:41
They won't *actually* invest in bitcoin but in contracts at certain prices so it won't increase demand/price
Seems it's just a way to get the big banks pushing the price around (like the gold market)
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:59:17
Yeah then the news turns bad, the bots melt down, the margin calls blow up and weak hands get trampled to death in rush for the exits...
Rinse and repeat
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:54:22
Nope but I did see it in 2014...in BTC...and fcuk me if it wasn't a bubble
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:55:57
Yes...Next question...
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:35:00
Oh my... you couldn't post that anywhere and not get banned
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:39:01
Yeah banning cash has more to do with negative interest rate policy and bank bail-ins than this *sudden* criminal/terrorist use...

He's an academic, 'thinking' is the only thing he does
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:21:39
Wow...I'm not sure I've ever seen someone hit and simultaneously miss the point so completely before... 
@_date: 2016-05-11 11:57:44
Fcuk...you quantum 1 it's a couple of weeks work to grind the rest...you think age of transactions would change anything?! 
(a huge part of the reason BTC works is you're not allowed to do shit 
like that)

Yes...he should buy Ether! :p
Baking the ability to 'protect' coins (or taint or colour or move or in anyway fcuk with) without the keys into the system is just a bad idea
@_date: 2016-05-11 11:48:58
No, just fcuking No...if Satoshi knows, understands or cares it's his fcuking problem... Not yours or mine...what if he wants to spend it?!

Too late for the BTC boat (still bought my 1st @ $90AUD)
Timed the ETH one perfectly though ;)
