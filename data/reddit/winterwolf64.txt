That's not it at all. It's the fear of regulation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:21:27
It's only down due to government intervention. It's exactly because the concept is valid and viable that some governments feel threatened by it.

I expressed some skepticism about Ethereum a while back even though I like how ambitious it is (but with greater complexity, there's also a greater risk of things going wrong). I was called a troll and wasn't even rude about it. :D

hilariously misguided
EOS isn't even real yet and neither is Cardano
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:40:03
fair point but how old is Bitcoin relative to the stable currencies?
this wasn't even about Bitcoin... it was about fear of government interference
that's why you got the crash
personally, I always assumed this was factored into the price... guess not

it would sacrifice decentralization if it were not possible
you would need permission to be able to use it

It's designed in a way which should make it a good store of value but that's much less the case if governments try to stop people from supporting something that doesn't reinforce their current power structure. This is essentially market manipulation. If China decided to ban usage of USD, it would certainly hurt the dollar (and probably their own currency too).
Cryptos need better privacy to avoid censorship from permission-based systems. This is part of why projects like Monero (most credible atm) matter. Plus, privacy is a necessity for maintaining a free society and is critical for security too.

Except it doesn't take hours and the fees are just ~$4 regardless of transaction size. Moreover, you get the notice that a transaction is propagating within seconds.

I'd have no problem with it either but it requires a hard fork and there isn't enough consensus to pull it off safely. Moreover, if they're going to do a hard fork anyway, they may as well have other important incompatible changes bundled with it too so that there's less friction in the future.

btc reaching 1 million would likely mean a collapse of confidence in the $ and not 1 million in today's terms
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:19:03
This is a good point I hadn't considered.

I suggest the Methuselah Foundation. Figuring out how to majorly improve healthspan will likely make great contributions to the fight against nearly all diseases just as a side effect. Directly researching cures for many of the worst killers is often a bit like pissing in the ocean because the root cause is aging processes themselves.
I believe extended productive lifespans are also necessary if we truly want to go to other planets. If not, humanity will perish along with the sun.

How is it easier to bend than core? I thought its goal was to be completely decentralized and not go off-chain.

If those coins had the same scale as BTC, they'd likely face the same problems. BTC didn't suffer these issues in 2013 either.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:21:09
Nah, it actually doesn't mean anything because we're in a universe with countless possibilities. By that logic, if you went all-in with 27o preflop and won vs AA, you were "right." Statistically, it's a horrible decision unless stack committed and the fact that it worked doesn't change that it's a bad decision.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:55
personally don't expect it to dip under 12000 this month... that was the price I expected it to be at right now

at this point, it feels more like panic selling rather than a response to any news events

even if btc were at 200k, there would be no clear way to say if it's a bubble or not... the terminology is just wrong. btc is a secure, trustless and deflationary platform without central control. it's very interesting but it has no clearly determined value.
traditional bubbles pop because of some real-world situation such as loans being unable to be paid. the tulip analogy so often posted about is fundamentally wrong. the "tulip bubble" didn't just randomly pop. it turned out that those tulips they thought were a new species were actually just sick. this would be akin to finding that hashes can actually be reversed and so the entire way cryptos function fails.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:29:15
what bitcoin faces is mostly a function of its size and market cap... take most alt coins and put them in btc's shoes and they would be facing the same problems
moreover, btc is more battle tested than any of them... nearly a decade without a security issue. the hashing power required to fool the network is nearly incomprehensible at this point.

I don't get why anyone thinks analyzing a graph like it's a crystal ball actually makes any sense. It's just humans trying to find/create patterns where there may often not be any. Even when there actually are patterns, those are not guaranteed to repeat and can often be just incidental. Elliott waves and other techniques don't have any direct effect whatsoever on the future. Likewise, the pattern of heads/tails for my last 20 throws doesn't influence the future results. It's all complete BS but people spend a lot of time doing it and think fancy lines/graphs make them somehow more informed.

Does Coinbase give larger withdrawal limits for wire transfers too or is it just the same as it says your withdrawal limits are?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:52
Is this just for you? Can anyone make a Gemini account and set up a wire transfer with no withdrawal limits too? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:54:38
Like anything, it's impossible to predict exactly what would have happened but there certainly wouldn't have been such a massive drop and loss of interest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:42:31
if it is at all scary for you, you shouldn't be investing
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:11:47
totally agree and investors avoid instability/infighting like the plague 
such squabbles make money run away from crypto as a whole 
just like investments dry up in regions with unstable governments, no one wants to get into something that looks like a bunch of kids arguing with each other while throwing out petty insults
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:11:51
cannot believe people can actually be emotionally invested in the price...
this is actually hilarious to me 
before any investment, one should consider all outcomes and be completely fine with them... this is an emerging market and you should never expect it to be a smooth ride up
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:49
I'm looking at their page and they have limits for Ach but there's this statement:
"Wire Transfers: There are no limits on deposits or withdrawals for Individual or Institutional Accounts"
How can this be true? Wouldn't they need massive liquidity to be able to potentially have people cash out 500k or more instantly whenever they feel like it? 
I thought Coinbase had a 10k/day limit regardless of method. Is this correct? I don't really understand how Coinbase is more popular if Gemini can literally cash out your entire account instantly if you feel like it.

The general ideas of the video still need to be addressed. How will Bitcoin remain censorship resistant if you will eventually need LN for transactions (to avoid extreme fees)? If LN hubs end up being just another banking arm, this seems rather pointless.
