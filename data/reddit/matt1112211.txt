I really appreciate your advice, it's definitely something I will weigh out in the next couple days. Cheers.

When I initially got flagged as high risk I did make a post but it was mostly for information cause I didnt know what happened and why. I didnt hate on them in the post or anything like that I just needed more info and to see what others did in this situation.

From what I understand, setting up a paper wallet is the best type of cold storage (long term, secure bitcoin storage). Coinbase has the option to print out a paper wallet I believe.

So far so good, looks like a really cool/nice/smooth platform. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:33:54
Completely agree with you on that.

A man walks into a bar and orders 20 pints of Guinness. He lines them up on the bar and announces that he’ll give £100 to the man who can drink all of them. Patrick sticks up his hand and says he’d like a go if the man can wait half an hour. Patrick then leaves the pub, comes back 30 minutes later and downs the 20 pints one after another. The man is impressed and hands over the money, ‘But tell me,’ he asks. ‘Where did you go to for that half an hour?’ ‘Ah, well,’ says Patrick. ‘Before I took your bet I popped to the pub next door to see if I could do it.’

The "high risk" flag is from an automated system. I assume it could be many variables such as bank issues, verification issues, etc. Sometimes they are a day or two late. Nothing about the system is perfect due to the high volume of sells, buys, and tickets Coinbase deals with. Wait till tomorrow or Wednesday if you can then just shoot over a support ticket asking what the status is (kindly..). If you receive an email back saying you have been flagged just stay calm, send a ticket in it explaining your situation and ask if they need any info to whitelist and honor your initial transaction. Like I said, I may have gotten lucky or not. I cant be sure but just be respectful and dont send 5 tickets or be a prick and I am sure they will sort out an issue if it even arises.

WHATS GOING ON? im in class, and getting push notifications price is dropping, did they fucking ban bicoin or something? lol.

I agree and appreciate the advice. I think im just going to invest it then go cold with it, have a paper wallet and just sit back on it.

My question is more of a guidance then question I suppose. I am 22 years old, and recently got an extra $1500 for writing c++ for a friend. I dont have a certain need for this money I suppose but obviously, to me, this is a good chunk of change. I'm curious as to if you were me, would you invest in bitcoin? I'm very aware that I could potentially lose this all. I am also aware at the end of the day you win some and lose some.

Can't agree with this. There are many credit card companies (Discover, Visa, Amex) why can't there be other crypto?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:34:51
mate, do you see the charts? lol. it could go one of two ways, it will keep skyrockting and we will all be filthy rich (which im hoping) or it eventually... it will crash down and stabilize (which is probably whats going to happen). that being said, think about it, would you want to use a currency where you buy a .005btc sub and then the next day that .005 is worth +$70? no... it needs to not be volatile before it is used as a currency thats accepted in most places which we are still very far from. I REALLY doubt it will be a DDOS attack.

thats a crazy story! definitely one of those "small world" stories you will remember for a long time. what was the most "impacted" question the compliance officer asked you? as far as bitcoin going really mainstream, i truly think it has, i attend city college and just the other day i overheard two students talking about investing and other joined in on the conversation. i feel the youth grabs the concept very quickly being born into more of a technological era persay. anyway, great story man! thanks for sharing.
