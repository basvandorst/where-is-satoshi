Not as impressive of a prediction as his April or July if he’s right.

If you watched the recent Libra hearings in the Senate and House, the government is more open to crypto than you think. In fact, there were some staunch supporters of crypto and its concepts. They also weren't delusional in thinking that fiat and the fed weren't without its flaws. 
As a payment method, you're right that Libra may be a better solution for that; however, it's still centralized. I think Libra, down the line, will end up just like fiat. What's to stop the consortium to unhitch Libra to those clusters of fiat? Then they just print more and we are in the same spiral. A decentralized system like bitcoin is the only true solution to this issue. 
And your mock scenario of 'what if USD is replaced by BTC tomorrow'. I'm fairly certain that any major transition that occurs this abruptly would lead to massive chaos and that's not a fair way to assess the validity of BTC.

No it’s not

This was when you bought, wasn't it?

Oh baby when you hodl like that...
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:19:17
USA people are not the only people who have money in BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-18 10:48:16
You should focus on one of the aspects of bitcoin that makes it a hero.. then you have a better ad.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:40:04
I get what you’re saying, but with the Fed Chair, Powell, stating BTC is a store of value like gold, we have tension on our hands. This tension is great for ratings for mainstream news and media tomorrow which will continue to raise awareness and consideration for bitcoin. Have you ever seen a debate about bitcoin where bitcoin has lost?
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:03:52
And then it suddenly jumps up and you just lost your position trying to short bitcoin and time this asset. 
Not saying you can't do it, but a lot of people have lost a lot trying to time this market. So that's why the general advice is to just hodl and long (very long) bitcoin.

Except he’s progressive....

He posted that on January 21, 2019. He didn’t predict the Dec 15 bottom. He just looked at the charts.

Why can’t it be used as a payment method?
If you are talking about price volatility, that’s solved with more market cap.
If you’re talking about slow rate, that’s solved once lightning network is finished.
What are you talking about people don’t care about decentralization? Its one of the main reasons I’m in this space now.
I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt and have a discussion with you, but it’s clear to me now you are just trolling. Either that or just dumb.

How accurate is that Gini coefficjent measured?

According to the tweet that reported this, it was his debit card that was restricted, and the help desk tweet from WF’s side didn’t mention anything about credit vs debit. However, many people have also reported that they’ve been able to use their debit cards just fine to purchase from Coinbase. So... I dunno
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:49:16
Higher market cap means market manipulation is much harder to achieve. So less volatility.
Your second point doesn’t make sense.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:40:34
It’s not about you. It’s about awareness and education for the masses on a mainstream platform
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:11:05
It’s better described as a store of value rather than a currency. Compare it to gold rather than USD. However, BTC has more use cases than gold does. So it’s even better .

Lazy fucks? This is mainly supporting jobs that are being wiped out by automation. Many of these jobs are truckers, factory workers, call centers, and retail workers. These are all hard working jobs. Not lazy.
Additionally, much of this money will be coming from taxing those companies who use automation. Like amazon.... who earns billions but pay zero in tax currently.
You really ought to educate yourself a bit more on a topic before replying with such a nastiness.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:13:11
It’s only banned as a currency here. You can still buy and sell it like an asset.

Couldn’t be worse than our current set of richest people.

Amazing argument. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2019-08-11 08:28:19
I’d you listen to his talk with joe Rogan, automation is projected to take a lot more jobs away within the next 11 years. 
Take a look at any amazon distribution center. All robots.
Self driving trucks will take over all truck drivers and be more efficient. In several states, this is the most common job too.
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:03:20
Yeah I think the bigger goal for Andrew was to raise this issue of automation and his solutions to the national stage. I find him and this stance very intriguing.

If you could change one thing about bitcoin’s design, what would it be?
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:17:21
I don’t quite understand how this conclusion was drawn. Noob here with this stuff. Does anyone mind elaborating?

His policy would directly benefit them... are you implying because he has an Asian face, they won’t vote for that?
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:51:41
This is true. You can purchase / sell bitcoin in Vietnam. Vendors aren’t allowed to accept it as legal tender.
