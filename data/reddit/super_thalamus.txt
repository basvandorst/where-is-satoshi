I'm interested in developing something like this. I think its semi-easy to figure out all the mechanics of the program. I'm curious how much interest there would be for something like it though. I know it would partly solve one of the problems with bitcoin transactions which is that they are non-reversible.

I'm curious if anyone has developed a program or mobile app that will let two people put their goods into a trade window then once both parties accept the trade is performed automatically. I think something like this would help cut down on fraud related to cryptocurrencies.
