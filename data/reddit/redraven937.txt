If you CAN'T retire on $1 million, you need to budget better. At a 4% safe withdrawal rate, that's $40,000/year, which is more than what most people in this sub probably make. Can't live in NYC (etc) maybe, but there's a huge gulf between "can't retire" and "I want a luxury life in a HCOL area for no reason".

Here's a potential scenario. ~~You sell your BTC for $1.8m and pay 40% in taxes, leaving $720,000 in USD. You put that in an index fund with a safe withdraw rate of 4% per year. This means you will get $28,800/year ($2400/month), forever, for doing nothing else. And still have the $720k, of course.~~
**Edit**: I mathed wrong. Assuming a worst-case scenario in which you were somehow taxed at 40% for the entire $1.8m amount, you would still have $1.08m. Put that in an index fund with a safe withdraw rate of 4% per year, and you can withdraw $43,200 per year forever. If the tax rate is 20% instead, you're looking at $57,600/year. So... basically you would get more money for doing nothing, than you would busting your ass in your best year. Plus, you know, still have $1m+ in the bank.
The above is probably antithetical to this sub, but it's always important to critically examine one's beliefs from time to time. What's your endgame? Bitcoin replacing fiat? Waiting until it hits $20k? $100k? You have to look at your own situation and determine your risk tolerance. And, perhaps more importantly, look at your own life. If you cashed out now instead of at $20k, would the "lost" $2m kill you inside? Or would you be fine with the stability that nearly ~~$30k~~$40k+/year would bring?
It's fantastic you got in on BTC early, but your current financial situation sucks. And maybe that's an argument for *not* cashing out. But if you play it smart, you can manifestly improve your life *right now*. Or, hell, sell 1 BTC and get yourself an emergency fund so you aren't living paycheck-to-paycheck.

Actually, you have a [90% chance]( of still having your entire principal via 4% SWR after 30 years. And you have a 66% chance of having *double*. The whole point of 4% is that is the percentage at which you can sustain yourself during the worst 30-year period in the stock market. If the next 30 years are only half as bad as the worst... you'll be more than fine.
