I copied it from a forum post, but the wrong post.I tried to find in this forum the wrong address details but it looks like it was erased.I already talked to the manager of the forum to try to check their DB's and they are also trying to help with that.

Yes I accidentally copy pasted it and found it out only when the destination address told me he didn't get my coins.
That's why I don't know who the owner is.

Here it is and I also edited the original post with it:

I manage to do my signature but what I do with it now?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:20:58
But I don't have a client ,my wallet is on blockchain.info.
Is there an option to sign a message too?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:05:02
Does it mean that he took my money and empty his wallet?
I sent it at 27/02
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:22:36

@_date: 2014-03-03 19:54:38

@_date: 2014-03-03 20:00:53
it took me time as only 2 days later the destination told me that he didnt recieve and I started checking where it went.Also he tried to help me.

It's like seeing a ghost coming back from the dead
The same story happened to me in 2014, I also had a wallet at blockchain.info.
I'm still waiting for the coins.
never copy paste again!!!
