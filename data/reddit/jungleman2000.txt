Me too. You guys scared the crap out of me, so I tried to move some to a new wallet (under 10 BTC). It was fast and arrived as expected. Maybe MTGOX will finally price adjust lower, to where the rest of the exchanges are at.

I had forgotten my password also. There is a paper form you can fill out and mail to japan. Luckily I had previously logged into the system to get my account balance and took screen shots over a year ago before they announced the claim process and before I forgot my password. I would complete the form as best you can and mail it in.

He should invest in bitcoin (buy a bunch). Then fund the core developers and grassroots campaigns to accelerate adoption.

Maybe "grassroots" was the wrong term. I was thinking of some kind of incentives for bitcoiners to go out and talk to their local retailers about accepting Bitcoin and helping with setup to do so.
