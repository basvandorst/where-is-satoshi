You should get an email.

I think you’re off by a power of $10. Should be up ~$400.

Scratch that. Just checked again. Ledgers are &gt;$100 now. Got mine for $70.

For one, a hardware wallet has actual security measures embedded. Also, it’s recoverable if you were to lose it or have it stolen.

They are also getting more expensive by the day. I bought a Ledger 2 weeks ago, it’s gone up $20 since then!

Sort of, but thanks!

Yeah that is main concern. Looking for something informative but light that discusses trends and current events/news relating to the topic.

But Legacy --&gt; Segwit is not, hence the Coinbase complaints? That would explain it!

GDAX isn’t supported in my state but Coinbase is. Most annoying thing ever that I can’t do this...

I'd like to transfer coinage from Coinbase to GDAX and then to my hardware wallet (because yay, no tx fees!!). Unfortunately, GDAX is not supported in my state. I'm still able to login via Coinbase credentials, but I'm obviously not able to buy or sell. Curious if I'm still able to use GDAX as a "transfer/transaction portal," for lack of a better term?

So in order for it to be cheaper/faster, does it have to be Segwit to Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:56:10
Thanks. So basically all three of my bullet points above are wrong... haha nice.

Am I the only one that rolls my eyes every time I read the word "crash" on this sub?

Finally, for like the 5th time in 3 days...
