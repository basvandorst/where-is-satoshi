Thanks for the clarification, I feel like this is the type of thing that should be talked about more.

So if you use Bitcoin to buy altcoin, when is it taxed? At the moment of sale they have equivalent USD value, so I'm assuming the tax is incurred when/if you convert that altcoin back to fiat for a profit? I haven't made this type of transaction but I'd like to know.

The problem is that schools can charge whatever they want and the government will happily give anybody and everybody the loans to pay for it. It's a destructive cycle where money isn't real and everybody gets screwed.

Oof ouch owie

It was my understanding that crypto taxes apply to capital gains, meaning you only pay taxes for the amount of profit you made on top of your initial investment. So if you bought $2000 worth of Bitcoin which you later sold for $1900, you don't owe any tax. 
Since at the time of sale Bitcoin and the altcoin will have equivalent USD value, there is similarly no capital gain to tax. It seems to me like you would only owe tax if the altcoin you bought skyrockets in value and you are able to convert that back into a greater amount of Bitcoin than you originally purchased the altcoin with, at which point you would pay capital gains tax on the USD value of the BTC profit you made. 
I could also be very wrong about all of this and should probably research it more before I get serious about realizing any gains.

THIS. There are too many people on this sub acting like judgemental financial advisors and talking down to people who bought at ATH. If the price had gone up even further to around 27k, you obviously wouldn't hear this garbage from wannabe Wolf of Wall Street types. 
This sub is famous for making fun of people who buy at ATH, but when the price surpasses that old ATH a week later you don't see that behavior anymore. 
For the record, I did not buy at ATH or even close to it, but I wouldn't pass judgement on somebody who did because I'm not a dick and I'm confident Bitcoin will go far, far higher than 19k in the near future.

That's exactly what it is.

The funniest part about this comic is how outdated it already is. 12k would be a great deal right now.

True story- A&amp;W released a burger called the third pounder, but it sold terribly because so many people thought a third pound was less than a quarter pound.

Did you meme yourself?

3-4k would be more of a correction than a crash, &lt;2k would be a proper crash. I hope it happens so I can finally buy more without paying ATH prices.

Don't forget about the poop hammock
