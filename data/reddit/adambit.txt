bitbill.eu is a similar service (no wallet and debit card) and they dont ask for any scans.
@_date: 2016-08-19 13:19:37
Definitely not the case. I never had any issue with bitbill.

Thanks for your probability calculation. Maybe a powerful mining farm could do it within a few days?

do you mean cointter.com? what happened to the project?
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:55:17
I justed tested the site. Very buggy! Gone fishing.. :(
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:45:10
Yes, I can afford to give away some coins :)
It's only 6-8 characters but I dont think it's that easy to bruteforce. Warpwallet uses scrypt to make the address generation both memory and time-intensive.

I'm done with snapcard!
Read this and learn:
**Apathy to regulation a deeper problem**
At the heart of the matter is the failure of the bitcoin community to recognize the problems inherent in the NYDFS regulation.
Citing his recent appearance at The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC), Steve Stockman said that far too many people were ambivalent about the proposed regulations. Saying he was “alarmed” by the feedback, Stockman added that many operated under the belief that, in the future, regulations for bitcoin will be lax given its unique qualities.
But, citing historical precedent and a front-row perspective on regulation, Stockman said this rosy outlook is far from certain. The failure to recognize this problem threatens efforts to lobby both Congress and the greater public on digital currency and its various uses.
Stockman concluded by saying that the bitcoin community needs to adopt a greater sense of urgency as regulations are being drafted. Otherwise, they risk ceding control of the conversation and leaving the rule-making process to those who might not fully understand bitcoin.

Why do you only support US retailers? The Snapcard widget also works in other countries.

Let's vote for a new (blockchain) currency unit. My proposal: **1BC = 1$ = xxx BTC**
Open for suggestions.
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:50:17


This! BC (blockchain) value = USD value.  BC/BTC rate = BC/USD rate
