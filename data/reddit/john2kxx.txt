The difference is that entering into an HOA contract was voluntary.

Unethical behavior such as dumping pollution on someone else's property would have to be dealt with by seeking damages for the violation of property rights.  There might be other things you'd consider unethical that I don't, so we would have to think about them individually.


You're right that there may have been gaps in the information that consumers were able to get in the past.  The market's reaction to that information may have been somewhat slower.
But today?  People get information at a rate no one dreamed of even 20 years ago.  I'd argue that there are very few secrets kept in any industry anymore, as it's very difficult to keep incriminating evidence under wraps for any period of time.  Most companies don't want to risk it, either, as it can bring them completely under.
If you believe that you're capable of making an informed, educated decision as a consumer, why assume that most others can't to a reasonable degree?
Also, you mentioned Walmart, and assumed I would know what you think is wrong there.  Could you elaborate on that a bit?

I own the property I live on.  Why would I pay a fee, and to whom?

Why should I move?  They're the ones who are initiating aggression.
Should I have to move if my neighbor comes on my lawn and takes a shit on it every day?

That's correct, but the government maintains a monopoly over many of the services they provide.  So in some cases, there are no alternatives.
Legalize competition, and we'll be more than happy to use services from producers who aren't stealing from us.

I don't know if you're being intentionally obtuse, or if you really didn't pick up the sarcasm there.

The same number of cellphones or cars you build.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:07:17
Correct.  That doesn't mean others wouldn't build them, though. :)

It doesn't matter what you see.  What matters is the unseen; what could have been produced if the state didn't take the money away from productive individuals?
It's that same line of thinking that allows the state to spend insane amounts of money on nice things, like maybe a park or monument.  When anyone complains about it, they just point to what was created. "Look at your tax dollars at work! It wouldn't be here if not for the state!"
What matters isn't what the state builds, but what *isn't* built because of the state's theft.

"How would we rape people like that?"

Sorry, but this seems like something that can be easily worked out.  For example, why not include fire protection service in HOA fees in the neighborhood you live in?

We didn't have anything resembling a libertarian society in 19th century NYC.  But thanks for that attempted "Gangs of New York"-inspired history lesson.

How do cellphones, cars, computers, and refrigerators exist without the government forcing people to pay for them?
What magic do the roads hold inside them that prevents anyone but the government from building them?
@_date: 2013-05-26 15:39:49
Right.  So I guess we'd have shopkeepers on one side of town, and people sitting in their homes on the other side of town, and everyone is just scratching their head, wondering what to do next.

"Natural" monopolies are a complicated topic.  I'd have trouble explaining it myself, but I'll link you to the same article I'm currently reading.
