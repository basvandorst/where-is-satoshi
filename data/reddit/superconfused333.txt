this is actually good news.  
Face palm
HLOD the coins that do not exist.  great.

The original version of Bitcoin also did not have a blocksize limit.  You and I can compromise.  Take away the limit, and keep RBF :)
@_date: 2016-07-16 07:48:38
i don't think this is true. RBF is a protocol level way to allow someone to double spend.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 09:24:32
This is simply not true.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 06:07:59
yes i think it's less great.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 07:02:44
I feel that the order of transactions is important, and that a fee should not dictate which transaction gets accepted on the network.  
Unconfirmed transactions have utility, and RBF changes and compromises some of this utility.  
I admit I don't have concrete examples beyond this.  I just know that I didn't like RBF when it was released, and I 'still' don't like the idea and I thought others might agree.  I'm not the smartest tool in the shed.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:45:21


Yes I can see more that it could do to try and get the order right!  It could accept the transaction that is older!  This is my point! :)

I like bitcoin.  I don't like the new feature called RBF.  You disagree. that is ok.  We can have different opinions.  Happens all the time.

the system was pretty complex at the beginning.  a 4 year halving created a mechanism that was easy to understand and ensured a 21 million coin cap which is one of the desired attributes the currency holds.  
There are an infinite amount of ways to accomplish the 21 million cap, Satoshi chose an easy to understand and effective method.  4 year halving.  It allows time for the system to gain popularity, as well as a way for coins to be distributed to users over a long period of time.  
Other options include  . . . . decrease mining reward each decade, each year, each month, each week, each hour etc
The 4 year halving has worked very well so far, and the tumultuous-ness of the event is overstated.  
Difficulty has frequently doubled in size over the years and this has a very similar effect on the bitcoin network.  Each time bitcoin pushes forward, hardly phased.  The community has plenty of time to prepare for the halving.  It works well.

i don't think game theory has any place on this rule.  Whether the halving is every four years or . . ,. spread out to  every hour . . . the game is still very very similar in the long run.  The reward gets smaller and smaller as time goes forward in btc units . . . while the value of btc units grows and grows and grows as time moves forward.  Simple game.

This is where I think you are wrong.  You really really could NOT double spend before RBF.  Bitcoin was DESIGNED to solve this problem.  There is only a single blockchain and coins are not in two places at the same time.  
RBF allows fees to dictate which transactions reach the blockchain.  This means I can spend something to a person for X, and if this person is not careful, i could make a new transaction with a higher fee after the fact.  This is bad.  
Bitcoin should aim to respect the order of transactions when possible.  It shouldn't replace transactions that CLEARLY, and i mean C L E A R L Y happened before them.  absurd.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 06:18:11
No.  I am not hoping others decide not to use RBF.  I am hoping RBF is removed from the protocol.  I am hoping users do not have the option to use RBF because I think it is a bad feature and a poor addition to the protocol.  
This is simply my opinion.  It is not an extreme stance.  Most of bitcoins life on earth RBF was not included.  Bitcoin grew and wonderful things happened and continue to happen.  I am simply expressing desire to go back to the days when RBF was not in the protocol.  I think we can define the issue better (stuck transactions is a poor definition) and I think we can craft a better solution to an issue once it is better understood.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:21:14
I disagree. There is clearly a way to determine the order of over 99% of transactions made on the network.  
I agree that there is an area where it is diffictult to determine.  This is why transactions are broadcast on the network.  
My issue is that in RBF, a transaction that CLEARLY happens after a previous transaction gets to bump it out of line with a higher fee.  So BY DEFINITION, RBF is taking an older transaction and puting in a new transaction, its not even TRYING to get the order right.  
Beyond RBF, the blockchain at least TRIES to get the order right!  It is a fundemental part of the system, to get rid of double spends.  The first one counts.  Transactions last week in the block chain are clearly ordered before transactions this week . We know because of the blockchain!

32mb sounds good to me.  deal!
@_date: 2016-07-16 06:34:10
You have enjoyed RBF for what 8 months?  Please detail how much fun you are having in 8 months of RBF.  
Why is it fun anyway.  My transactions never get stuck!
Anyways i am not the only one that does not like RBF.  There are other developers that agree with me. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 09:26:06
This flag only allows me to see when someone is using a feature I don't like.  RBF.  Why do people think that if there is a flag that this thing is somehow ok.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:59:07
Bitcoin worked really well without RBF.  I think it would continue to be great without RBF.  Maybe we should just take it out.  We are working with a 10 billion dollar transaction network after all, better to get things right.  
It still seems to me that RBF allows a transaction that is CLEARLY newer take down an older transaction.  In every other frame of mind on the bitcoin network this would be a catastrophic result.  Just because the transaction is 'unconfirmed' it is suddenly totally ok.  I think it is the opposite, i think it is totally not ok.  
@_date: 2016-07-16 10:13:24


I am confused on this.  You don't have to signal.  You can still double transact UTXO without signaling after RBF.  
I see, if i send an RBF transaction, the signal is there and wallet software can be configured to detect it?  and not accept it?
So a transaction can be accepted at zero confirmation, and the user in this case can be 100% sure there will not be an RBF event IF the transaction was not flagged in the first place?

I am an active developer.  I simply don't work on the bitcoin protocol.  Even inactive developer's are allowed to have an opinion.  
And that is one of my points.  It is NOT extreme to have an opinion.  I simply stated that I did not like RBF.  I am allowed to not like it.  I am allowed to make a post about not liking it.  Happy to argue and discuss, but I don't consider it extreme to hold an opinion and express it.
