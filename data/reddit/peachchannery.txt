Okay what did I just read, HAHAHAHAHAHA, you obviously haven't the slightest clue on macroeconomics. These aren't claims and arguments. They are a textbook fact, there are graphs, models and formulas for these kinda things. But since you don't know what you're talking about, I don't mind giving you a crash course.
First what is an economy? Its basically the movement of goods and services.
What determines the size of an economy? The volume of goods and services flowing in the economy.
What happens when theres trade and foreign investment? Its like a pipe, it pumps the size of the economy
Then money goes into businesses, which goes into wages, which goes into pockets of normal people like you and me. And we spend a percentage of that, and save a percentage of that.
How do we determine the percentage? Through a formula but essentially it takes into account of the tax, culture and type of economy a country is.
The higher the percentage the better, because an economy wants people to be constantly spending and constantly contributing to the economy. Saving lowers the percentage needless to say.
That way government gets more revenue in taxes, business get more revenue in sales then people get their paychecks and the cycle repeats. So saving is baaaad. Thats not to say that we shouldn't save, but its looking at the situation objectively.
I can show you some case studies
America: Bush urge americans to shop
China: China's urgent shift into a consumption based economy
India: Huge obstacle of stagnant economy because of a missing middle class to push consumption up for the economy
Japan: Struggling to get its economy to keep its pace by getting young people to spend more
But I get what you mean from your reply. Saving is good for the individual. Without a doubt, it has long term benefits for the individual. No shit. Everybody knows that. But money sitting around is output forgone for the economy. It has little to do with how you spend your money (this is your point right?), but everything to do with whether you choose to spend it and contribute back into the system.
And during high inflation, sure some might wanna get rid of their currency. But this has little impact on anything at all. Inflation mostly affects standard of living, trade income or confidence of foreign investors.
By the way these are all facts, like how water is wet, fire is hot and the fact that I feel you are someone who might enjoy learning economics.

Ahh this is fucking hilarious, idk if you’re brainwashed or just a child. The fact that you’re self taught means you shouldn’t go around spewing nonsense. Since you enjoy economics I recommend you start with a basic macroeconomics textbook. And btw send me your article, and any other materials you studied economics from, I’ll read all of them, I like economics
