Yeah, that adds to the pricetag...

If you do not mind me asking, what does the annual compliance looks like in terms of time for the company?
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:52:25
Pretty much, limiting virtual-currency based business to one state is impossible...
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:55:36
Oh no doubt about that -- being a lawyer myself, I know what legal fees costs businesses in general and startups in particular
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:53:39
Yeah, and the $5k is not the only cost either...

No, for the Department of Finance to review the application
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:00:22
I would say that depends on what the state is trying to do. If the point is to set the bar to weed out folds who are not serious, then yea... totally reasonable
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:12:45
Well the application is not calling for anything specific. I would guess it depends on the size of the company and the amount of people it deals with

The most interesting thing to me was that second life kinda acts like nothing is new. It like they hope FinCEN would go away :)

I did not find their registration. Can you give me the link if it is not to much trouble? Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:16:59
Ok, he says that miners who deal with Mt Gox do not need to register and miners who sell to people need to. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:11:46
Hey man, if you are right and I am wrong I will be the first to admit it. I understand that technically miners do not issue bitcoin, all I am saying is that FinCEN won't see it that way.
Whether I am right or not, time will tell soon. Every virtual currency MSB has to be registered by October. So if miners are users nothing will happen, if miners are money transmitter I think we will see some selective enforcement

I think its too early in the game to tell whether it is superior or not. But thanks for reading :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:16:34
That they will
@_date: 2013-06-25 14:09:30
Are you suggesting sandpaper instead, sir?
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:56:53
No, I did not miss this part. But there is also this part


The way I read it, a bitcoin miner may fall under the regulation because he is issuing bitcoin. Now he may not have authority to redeem, but exactly what it means is not clear. At least to me. 
Please point me to the language where an administrator or exchanger is someone who is operating a virtual currency system. Also here is another direct quote:

The US gov did not shut them down on its own. They cooperated with various governments around the world. Technically the government needs something more than suspicion, they need probable cause, which is what they had in this case. In other words they had enough proof to convince a judge that LR was doing money laundering and operating a money transmitter without a license
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:51:09
Thanks for diagnoses. I will make sure to have it looked at. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:32:47
That is what it seems like to me as well, but this language in the guidance makes it seem like just the act of selling Bitcoins for any reason would require registration


under FinCEN’s regulations
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:58:35
Truly you have opened my eyes!
@_date: 2013-08-26 17:36:51
Guidance describe how existing regulations apply. For example "msb requirements apply to virtual currencies." An example of regulation would be "an msb is defined as..."
Each state has a different requirement for a money transmitter licensing. Money transmitter is part of an MSB so federal definition applies. You are right though that a MSB requirements are the same for every state, because it is a federal regulation. Money transmitter license requirements differ though...
@_date: 2013-08-26 04:12:56
New York is the first state that gave notice of an upcoming regulation. They do not regulate it yet. Look at the language of that memo


As far as I know, no other state started regulating virtual currencies yet, save for California.
FinCEN only came up with its guidance - which is not really a regulation - in March.
Once again. If you look at the body of that memo its not "AND additional regulations." 


To me this means they are thinking of coming up with separate regs.
If you know of any other state that regulated virtual currencies as money transmitters please let me know. I am happy to find out more.
@_date: 2013-08-26 18:38:44
yeah, you're right. Glanced over it
@_date: 2013-05-09 22:01:48
I think FinCEN will not care whether miners actually issue bitcoin or not. They will see it as issuing withouth bothering to determine whether they actually "issue" new ones 


“earning,” “harvesting,” ”mining,” “creating,” “auto-generating,” “manufacturing,” or “purchasing,” depending on the details of the specific virtual currency model involved. **For purposes of this guidance, the label applied to a particular process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of the person engaging in the process.**
