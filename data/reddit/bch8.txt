I'm not entirely sure to be honest with you. Maybe would know. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:07:41
The problem with TA isn't that it uses math, it's that it doesn't. If you think math is useless for trading I don't even know what to say to you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:32:44
Glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:17:22
My pleasure :)

Ah you're right that was dumb of me
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:32:56
I found it just googling for info about bitcoin mining and it's honestly one of the most helpful articles I've found so far. It just really helps you understand everything. I didn't realize it was a repost when I submitted it but I still think that was so long ago that it was worth resubmitting again for all the newer users.

~~The hashes per day was calculated in 2014 so that rate has probably gone down over time as the difficulty as gone up~~
edit: This is wrong, per &gt;Hashrate doesn't change, target value does which means you need more hashes on average.
Sorry, it's late here I got a bit mixed up

Is the usd's value attained by people buying it?
@_date: 2018-08-15 08:15:03
Or it won't 
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:15:12
Or it's not happening
@_date: 2017-02-03 20:40:08
I know it's a stretch but can a knowledgeable historian/economist fact check this? It seems like it's based on a couple borderline conspiracy theories.
@_date: 2017-02-03 02:14:34
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:28:52
Not saying you're lying but do you have a source? I'd be interested to read about this
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:57:32
That's fair

His Wikipedia page also says both his brother and his wife believed it was an accidental death. I feel like that's pretty important to point out.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:08:19
I'm not saying I think they're experts, I do not think that. I just think of anyone they would be the most intimately involved with the situation besides Hastings himself, and they would have every motivation to pursue an investigation if they had an inkling of foul play. The fact that they both are on record saying they believe it was an accident may suggest that there is good reason to believe it was an accident based on Hastings behavior. I'm also definitely not saying I'm convinced that it *was* an accident, it just so happened that I had just read his wikipedia page prior to seeing that comment so I thought I would add on with an interesting tidbit I had learned. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:05:56
It's absolutely fucking idiotic. I was agreeing with the post until he gave those examples and he just completely lost me. If someone is using that line of reasoning I'm just not going to take anything they say seriously.

Well to be fair, on paper she's a good candidate. It was probably hard for them to see past that because they are pretty far detached from the common man's sentiment.

So I looked up Metronome and searched for some reddit posts about it. Over on r/btc people are saying this is a blockstream scam, and  here people are saying it's damning for 2x. Can someone explain how the hell that can even happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:16:23
Yeah I really don't get why everyone's so confident that would spell the end for crypto.

I've actually read that any amount of bitcoin bought in 2010 would be worth 7.000.000% more, believe it or not

I don't have a strong opinion in this debate, I see both sides and overall more than anything I just hate the "holy war" feel to it and the propaganda campaigns on both sides. That said I don't understand why some people find it so offensive that a technology discovers a better niche sometime after it was initially conceived of. That concept is essentially "pivoting", which is cornerstone of silicon valley start ups. Facebook never would've been successful if Zuckerberg was like "No we can't add messengers in that's not what I wrote in my original whitepaper!!". I fully support bitcoin cash and actually own some, I think there's need for both, I just don't think it needs to be so contentious. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:26:50
The other issue is larger block sizes quickly become strenuous on weaker internet connections which can leave entire geopolitical areas with weaker or possibly even split node networks from the main blockchain. And these are areas where they already have weaker infrastructure, in other words the exact areas that are supposed to benefit the most from the democratization of banking.

Is any of this possible for a non-professional trader/hobbyist? I'm really interested in these topics and would love to get into some day trading. Could I provide liquidity? Do some algorithmic trading or machine learning? Or can I only really trade rumors as a hobbyist? Or is holding really all I should be doing as a hobbyist? For what it's worth I'm proficient in cloud IT, web development, and high level mathematics, so I think I have some of the skill sets that could allow me to broach these areas. Would really appreciate your advice. 
Edit: I should also say I realize HFT is beyond the pale, I'm more just interested in general automated trading

You understand that the debt crisis in Greece happened because the country *didn't* have control over its currency. That can literally never happen in the US so long as the primary currency is the USD. Ironically if Greece 2015 scares you then you should be very afraid of bitcoin. 
Edit: 
Also to respond to your other points since you're saying people aren't. 
1. What exactly is it that you think we don't have control over? This is such a broad and fundamentally misguided statement that I have a hard time even responding to it. 
2. It's in the long term interest of the US government, and any government, to have a stable and predictable currency valuation with minor and consistent inflation. The value of currency is a function of many things, but to the extent that the fed influences it it is stabilizing. 
3. If you think bitcoin is anonymous then you basically have no idea what you're talking about. Additionally fiat cash is entirely anonymous, so idk what you're worried about. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:59:02
Bitcoin can be thought of, dare I say quite accurately, as digital gold. For that reason it is very attractive to techo-libertarians, anarcho-libertarians, and people who generally subscribe to Austrian economics. They've already bought into the "return to the gold standard" conspiracy, so bitcoin is in some ways a perfect fit for their pre-existing views. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:05:59
That's... Not that deep of a question

What I meant with my HFT comment was that it would probably be beyond the pale for a non-professional because it is mostly about getting edge from really expensive infrastructures. But I could totally be wrong about that, what do I know. And thanks a bunch for all the advice. I will probably be mostly holding long term with my crypto investments but I still want to try my hand at some sort of day trading or swing trading with a smaller investment. How capital intensive is arbitrage really? Your comment on that topic kind of surprised me to be honest, because my impression so far has been that these markets and exchanges are still so young that there are a lot of inefficiencies to be found. I was thinking of like maybe some triangular arbitrage between LTC, BTC, and ETH across multiple exchanges. I'm sure this stuff is all way easier said than done though and that's probably what I will discover. It seems like all the various fees and risks involved can be a real killer if you aren't super careful. 
I'm also planning on getting [this]( book. If you have any other book recommendations that would be awesome!
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:45:34
Do you have any proof Jamie actually did this? Or are you just theorizing

I mean you're not wrong, but what's your point?

Except way less jobs would exist to pay salaries because there was way less economic activity, investment, and growth.

Not to mention the increase in value that bitcoin has seen in the last few years isn't even due to deflation
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:25:04
I see thanks for explaining! 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:46:52

@_date: 2017-05-24 18:14:10
Yeah there's just so much potential for the technology as a whole that I imagine that's the case. I'm still probably going to invest in bitcoin though, it should be strong for the foreseeable future. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:12:58
Why put all of it? Why not just half? Seems excessively risky.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:03:56

What do you mean by log charts? Im a newbie
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:03:39
Thanks, that was informative. I still feel like there's risk exposure to bitcoin because of the fact that there's so much room for innovation in blockchain technology implementations, and bitcoin is really just the most basic form of it. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:42:52
Fair enough. I'm just saying I want to get in soon, maybe I can still wait to see if it trends down a bit first. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:50:23
But theres still the concern that it will be replaced by a different crypto currency
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:58:33
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:53:05
Do you think eventually they'll make a smaller denomination of a Bitcoin the standard unit for ease of pricing and currency use?

One thing I've found to be fairly consistent across most of reddit is a high degree of conspiratorial thinking that doesn't really match the reality if you actually happen to come across a topic you are familiar with outside of reddit

Can I store my bitcoin on Gemini too? Should I just not use coinbase at all or is there some other use case for it?
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:59:13
Ah okay that makes sense thank you. Seems to me even with Segwit bitcoin will still have issues that make it come up short against ether no? I'm a crypto noob so I'm probably off the mark here. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:17:01
Interesting thanks. What are the monetary qualities bitcoin has over ether?
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:38:32
He literally made this exact point
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:10:50
Well that's fine and you may be right but that has little to do with the point the comment you responded to was making
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:50:02
Economic growth isn't constrained to physical resources
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:50:51
Can someone explain to me if segwit is implemented, how will Bitcoin be functionally different from Ether?
