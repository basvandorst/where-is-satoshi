I talk about this in the third section about micro loans! Through bitcoin, micro loans become way more transparent cause you can track the loan through the blockchain. This in turn lessens the staff time required to follow up on loans, which means that the overall fee can be way lower.

I do address that with models like BitPesa, the currency transfer fee is already included, but I could perhaps make that clearer...

March 1st. I know it's still pretty rough, but I have a lot of time this week to work on it.

Are you sure? I thought I was referencing pretty well... could you give me an example? 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:15:56
No worries, I appreciate your input. I don't have tons of experience with academic style writing
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:10:42
Yeah, I was thinking about putting that in somewhere... I want to write more, but this is supposed to be an 10 page writing sample and it's already 11 without a conclusion haha
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:11:52
Yeah, you right. Should be fixed now
