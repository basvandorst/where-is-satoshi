Ok. Is it so hard to hop onto their trading venue at gdax and buy / sell with near nil spread and no transaction fees? I don't understand why nobody, not even their CEO, points this out whenever people bitch about Coinbase fees or spreads.

Coinbase is their BTC payments processor. It may just be a startup with buggy code / poor site design.

Brokers? As in human middlemen? I'm asking because Globex is a brokered electronic exchange that executes trades instantly around the clock. It's cheaper than hiring a human.

Is SWIFT free? Or how would you get the fiat back to bitstamp to repeat the process?

Global commodities are not limited to 8 hours of trading. Oil, gold, copper etc are traded around the clock for obvious reasons.

I don't see why you can't reveal what bank banned you if this is 'real'. They kicked you to the curb, in writing, so it's not like you can be held liable for libel or slander. So far, all we have is merely FUD; a story that entertains but provides no info to anyone.

USD tether tracks USD. It's exchange traded (poloniex or shapeshift) or you can keep it in your tether wallet.

The term wallet in crypto is a misnomer because crypto wallets do not actually hold coins. They hold keys. They really should be called keychain or keykeeper for accuracy. Everyone's coins are on the blockchain. If someone gave you their keys, you have no way of knowing that they didn't make duplicates of the keys to go to the address and loot.

If someone sells you a gift card purchased with a stolen credit card, that gift card may be cancelled before you can actually use it. This is why seasoned buyers accept only gift cards purchased with cash and demand to see the receipt; checking if it's been photoshopped.

Good luck out there.

Op said nothing about cash. Op intends on "transferring funds", i.e. wire transfer.  There are so many people who seem to be fascinated by terrrrists and pedos these days.

You setup a Reddit account just fine and reply using formatted quotes but you can't understand how to send btc? Yeah, right.

Just to cover all bases, you are entering the correct CVN code, right?

Curious but only if can answer: what did you sell for over 2 btc that you didn't wait for at least 1 conf before shipping. I want to know what to look out for because I do a lot of selling in btc. Cons are never 1 and done.

If your phone requires a fingerprint scan or passcode for access, and locks after a short idle time, and you have Lookout or a way to disable the phone remotely if lost, why logout of Coinbase? I never logout. 
It's the same reason Google authenticater does not have passcode security settings. It relies on your phone's security. 
In your Coinbase account security settings, you can see a list of all active sessions and logout any you no longer use or don't recognize. They obviously offer this feature because there are many of us who don't logout.

Oil is not at an all time low. Far far far from that at $40 / barrel wti. I started buying btc when 1 unit priced at less than 100 USD. So to me 600 USD is no indication of failure. Have a little patience. 
I will tell you a lil secret though. It is a market myth that aggregate demand and supply drive price. In the real world, whales drive price. You can't ride a whale with weak hands and a fluttering heart.

Most wallets that noobs use will not allow a double spend. It is very possible that this is an intentional con. Keep that in mind when dealing with this customer.

Don't listen to him. You are no more greedy or shady than Coinbase, Kraken or any other seller of Bitcoin. The just have tons of security measures and safeguards they employ when accepting PayPal and you had none. Plus, PayPal sellers on paxful ask for an avg of 95% above price. This is why. They have seller scam guides on the site. Do more research, or start selling something else. Good luck.

Friends and Family payments are supposedly harder to chargeback because, obviously it implies money sent as a gift with no expectation of a good or service. So, none of your chargebacks were Friends and Family payments?

Poloniex has a usd tracking coin; usdtether. You can sell it for tether. But then I believe you would have to keep it at the exchange because I haven't heard of a tether wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-25 12:07:27
People transfer btc to their own wallet rather than keeping it at the exchange because if the exchange gets hacked or suddenly goes out of business you may be SOL and coins. 
Also, some exchanges (ahem, Coinbase) are suspected of tracking where users send coins and will shut down an account if a user sends coins from a Coinbase wallet to a site / wallet that violates their sensibilities. Coinbase pays the miner fees when sending from your Coinbase wallet so I guess that justifies that policy.

So many people are having their accounts closed by Coinbase that it's getting hard to recommend them to new coiners. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:56:01
When Coinbase closes an account, they seldom give an exact / specific reason. Coinbase can be a great partner and I wouldn't risk the relationship on something like that when there are so many alternatives.

Ripple is a threat to SWIFT or SEPA but not btc.
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:00:52
With Wells Fargo deposits arrive next day if submitted before noon eastern. Either way nothing to worry about. Coinbase is very good at making sure you get your funds. 
Since the status has gone from pending to completed, you can probably call BOA to verify that you have an ach coming through. Normally, they can look and see it even before it actually posts to your account in their internal systems.

Sounds like you want to hodl / invest. I would suggest that you "start" buying now. Buy on a regular schedule. Buy a little more during big down moves. You'll buy at some tops and buy more at some bottoms, but you'll never feel foolish ��
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:12:11
I believe you have to pre-authorize these types of transactions online first then get your cash code because these atms will not spit out cash with 0 conf.
If you think you may need to do this again, or can wait about a week, I suggest looking at bitpay visa debit. The card costs about $10, the exchange rate is much better than atms; instant loading, and free (no fee) cash advances at pos. There's a $2 fee if u use an ATM.

No matter what happens to the dollar, pound or any other fiat currency, if you have 0.01 btc in your wallet at this moment you will still have 0.01 btc in your wallet tomorrow and next week. 
Now, if the dollar falls to $1000 per 1 btc ( another way of saying this is that the value of 1 btc rises to $1000) then your 0.01 btc will now be worth 0.01 x 1000 = $10
On some other day, if the value of the dollar rises to $500 per 1 btc (another way of saying this is the value of 1 btc falls to $500) then your 0.01 btc will now be worth 0.01 x 500 = $5
