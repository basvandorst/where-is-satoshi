Technically the two are not mutually exclusive. I've seen sales with coupons at Costco only to come back a month later and the product costs less than the sale price. Sales only look at what the product cost right before the sale, and do not take into account a wildly fluctuating market.

I kinda understand this line of thinking that so many have mentioned in these comments. However very low adoption (ie OPs 0.95%) is not the calling sign of a successful investment. We may call ourselves "innovators," but that doesn't make it true. With low adoption bitcoin runs the risk of simply fizzling out, I mean hell, over 50% of bitcoin funds and ICOs blow up in less than a year so far. That's a spectacularly high failure rate for a public offering. If it starts to become too widely adopted, on the other hand, it will be heavily regulated, thus defeating the idea of bitcoin for some people to begin with.

I'm talking about like coinbase etc. They can't legally operate in my state.
I'd like to see you try turning bitcoin into real money or products in any practical way in my state and see if it works.

You may have a different definition of simple and practical.

Oh yeah? You just watch. In my state they already banned wallets.. All they really need to do is make it harder to do business with bitcoin to kill it for the public. 
My point before your digression is that what kind of warped mindset do you have to have to think that low adoption rate is a *good* thing?
The entire world knows about bitcoin, it's like AAPL stock. People already know about it and know if they want it or not. And yet almost nobody is buying in? Kind of a weird thing to wave around and say that you're winning..
