You need internet to connect to the decentralized exchange. And china can read all outgoing traffic so they would just crack down on it eventually.

Maybe its the whales shorting or maybe bad news really gets into peoples minds.

I have never filed taxes before. So how do I file for cryptocurrency in the first place? What percentage do they take away from my gainz?
I heard that if you hold for less than 6 months then you dont need to report it.

I read that btc's futures shouldnt impact the value of the price. 
I think the value of btc and all the coins are too inflated. That's why everything is correcting now.
Theres a conspiracy theory that tether has been pumping into btc and bringing the price back up when btc drops.

What does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:17:21
They can ban crypto by banning all the exchanges like China's great firewall. Crypto is banned in china
