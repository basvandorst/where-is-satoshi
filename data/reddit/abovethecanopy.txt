  Yes, if I was a server and was tipped in bitcoins I'd be pissed. On top of that, anyone having a problem with tipping (in the U.S.) needs to work in the service industry for a bit to get a clue on what it entails to serve the public.  **Upvote for you OP!**

No worries, I think the important thing with being in retail or food service, is that like begats like, regardless of position or what have you. I think for every douche you get, you also get people who get it, or get you. The trick is, is to not let it shut you down. Otherwise, nothing is getting through. It's amazing how day to day transactions impact if you let them, both good AND bad. Don't let the shit stick and keep the gems.

  I understand that. But I'd definetely question the source (the customer in question) and ask how savvy are you in going out?  People that go out often and have experience know what's up (for the most part, always exceptions). If I go out with someone, and they're cheap, NO WAY. I add to the tip, and let them know what's going on. It's an embarrassment and it's not fair to the server.  
  As far as getting paid for what you're going through, sure, until then, show a little gratitude.

Oh man, retail is a whole different beast, but a beast nonetheless, it's amazing how people treat one another especially when one is on the receiving end. Thanks for the tip on the book, I'll check it out!
