Thank you for sensible reply. You seem to be the only one that sees the big picture (this is very good publicity.) Everyone else bitches about details.

You have a misunderstanding of what that column means.  1TB of io read is not downloading 1.1 over the network. 1TB of reads over many hours is not much at all. A program will read the same data over and over again. 
From MS  "...I/o reads: The number of read input/output operations generated by the process, including file, network, and device I/Os..."

True, but pointless statement. That can be said about anything, including any bitcoin group or company.
What maters is this; Do their views, goals and abilities align with your views, goals and abilities. This is a evolving process and always changes over time.
Look at Gox; In the early days it incredibly valuable to community and bitcoin would not be where it is without them. Then the bitcoin community grew, and Gox changed from an asset to a liability. Gox didn't change but the world changed around them.
The fed can be seen that same way; The world is (slowly) moving away from USD with the strength and ambition of China and Russia. The fed is not dumb, they know this. Because of the changing world around the fed, you see the fed changing in response.

That's fucked up

I was taking a split literally. 
But why not just use milbit or any other name people decide to use. People will figure out a name on their own. Having a bitcoin meaning one thing one year and something else on a different year is confusing.
Even in the US people are comfortable with liter and milliliters on soda drinks and such.

OP, maybe you should actually read the FULL report. The evidence is quite strong in support of it. But judging from your comments you've made your mind already.

How exactly does the etf impact price? I mean, the twins have tons of coins ?100mil USD worth, right? Will it work like an exchange ?

That's exactly how I feel, with a the VC capital flowing in the last 6 months. I dont know for sure, obviously, but it sure seems like a lot of little companies are starting up. I expect to see a bunch see the light of day at the end of 2014.
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:19:54
You read my mind!
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:40:13
Exactly. Its risky, but if successful, could be quite profitable.

If people don't like using btc, they'll use mbtc, satoshies or whatever. Its as simple as that. People adapt much better than you expect, just give it time.

Early to mid 2015. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:39:24
Certainly early data that will need continued watching, but great news! Bitcoin for the planet ☺
@_date: 2014-01-17 23:33:07
How would that be enforced/verified?

What fuck is wrong with everyone? This man has earned the right to have his opinion. He is smart and a proven history. Is it really so bad if his view is different than ours? Chill out!
@_date: 2014-01-23 06:10:29
No no no no. Bitcoin as deflationary is core the idea behind it.
And to answer your question; the protocol does not use bitcoin, that's just a human name for a ton of satoshies. The protocol uses satoshis for everything internally.

How is doubling the amount of coins any different from the feds printing large sums of money?

Lol the video is about beanie babies! Yes, that was truly an insightful invention and changed the world......

Yea, it is important.

"...The cryptobond sold to FNY will pay 7% interest over a five-year period. As an added security precaution, Overstock will issue a $5m loan to the firm with a 3% annual interest, an arrangement the company said would "transfer the economic risk associated with the failure of the technology". Both agreements come with their own put and call terms.
As part of the deal, the release suggested that FNY's HYDRATrade, its proprietary market access software, would integrate with Overstock's tØ.com cryptosecurities trading platform..."

What I don't get is this; It's not technology that limits the use of T0. Its legacy systems, rules etc etc. 
Not sure how the blockchain would solve any of that. 
Regardless I'll be following this thread during the live stream :)
