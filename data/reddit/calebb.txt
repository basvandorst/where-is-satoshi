This sounds like the beginning of an intriguing tale...
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:25:34
Very well said.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:23:43
Oof, on point.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:49:36
Yeah, but the grace period doesn't work. I keep trying to log in and nothing happens...
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:54:47
Dat earf.

This is nice, but isn't this identical to Coins – Bitcoin Value that's going for $1.99? I ask 'cause it shows up right next to yours when searching for it.

You've colored me interested. Does Cointerra have a decent track record and would imagine their 2TH rig to be worth it once May comes around?

This is so messed up in ways they're too delusional to understand. I love it.

Simple bank has been rockin' for Bitcoin transactions in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:12:39
Such a powerful headline...
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:06:08
That. Is. Awesome!
@_date: 2013-05-04 02:17:47
I just kept clickin' until I was clean outta votes. Let's see this come true!
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:45:58
For this month. What about a year from now?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:56:00
This is so on point, you (but *you* do) have no idea.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:40:36
Wanna know why you guys rock? Because retroactively honoring users is the freakin' jam, that's why.
Thank you, Gyft! And thank you for funding my purchased-with-bitcoin television :)
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:03:18
Haha you deserve an up vote for this one...
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:38:26
Dat layout tho.

Middle dude is straight up [Gob](
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:38:03
So jelly.
@_date: 2013-12-15 00:32:19


Seems legit!

The carousel images on the front page are poorly designed, the information hierarchy is scattered, and the icons/assets are just weird stock selections. Like I said, I believe in them and I think they could be an awesome brand, I just think they need a little help. That's all :)
PS: bonus points for being kinda responsive.

Not really his fault for posting it so much as HuffingtonPost making crazy claims :)
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:09:35
I shan't believe this! He is an outstanding redditor who...oh, he's only been around for 6 hours. Never mind.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:03:48
It's not a conspiracy theory. He's a friend of mine and this really did just occur. I'm sure that isn't enough to sate your imagination, but it's true :(

Coinbase takes a bit, especially if you're account isn't at level 2. I wouldn't sweat it though considering you've locked in the price and whatnot.
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:03:57
^ bingo.

I would love to redesign Bitpay's website. I believe in them, but their branding is totally whack.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:02:24
From a dude with zero sales?
