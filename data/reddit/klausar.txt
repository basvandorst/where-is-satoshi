If someone you don't know tells you how you can make money easily it's almost always a scam.

Good luck, they shouldn't be legally allowed to do that. Since they are operating in the US you should contact a lawyer.

People already thought they missed the boat at 10$ and then they thought they missed the boat at 100$, then at 800$ and at 2000$ (I know it because I was one of them lol)
Now it's at 7000$ and people think the same.
The truth is: Noone knows, but it's likely that it will keep going up.

You definitely get the amount of bitcoins you would've gotten at the moment you confirmed the transaction. Imagine ordering 20 grams of gold on amazon and only receiving 18 because the value of gold was rising between you're payment and their delivery.
