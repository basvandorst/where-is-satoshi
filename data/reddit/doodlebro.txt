That's still quite misleading. If they tack on a withdrawal tax that's still a tax on the miners. It just pushes it back one step.

Why in holy hell would he do that
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:19:28
I'm sure they'll notify you they've taken them before already dumping them.
Stupid.

You are entirely missing the point of cryptocurrency if you trust something like that to a chrome extension which can very easily start stealing everyone's funds.

If satoshi did that, he would have signed the message.
It's not satoshi. You people are hilarious.

ahh so now you clarify. You're a class act dude :)

Uhhh, not really. IPs are changing all the time, it never would have worked.

Two comments above mine:


You know, if you started an exodus of large operations to move to p2pool, perhaps the whole "luck" aspect you seem to hate would kind of dissolve away.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:31:45


The post was great and informative up until here. This is flat out not true. Even mining on someone elses P2POOL is leagues safer than what GHash does. A person running the pool would need to make a lot of changes to the code of p2pool on top of getting none of the users to notice what they're doing. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:19:33
I know they do, that's the point I was making.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:36:08
Seriously, this guy hasn't even looked into what p2pool is or how fucking easy it is to get started on it.
Not to mention most people's issue with variance on p2pool boils down to latency on someone else's p2pool server. Running your own instance makes a significant difference in the number of blocks you can hash.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:32:55
What baffles me is how fucking stupid people are in not seeing a message from satoshi of this magnitude WOULD be signed. He created bitcoin for fucks sake. Dorian is not satoshi, and satoshi did not post on that p2p alternative aggregate.

Let's just shut down the stock market then because that is exactly how it works.
Buy faster internet.

How in holy hell was no accounting done whatsoever to check balances. If it were off by even 5 bitcoins I'd be investigating that shit hard. How can they get bankruptcy protection with that much incompetence?

Your average bitcoiner barely knows what R^2 actually means, let alone knows how to use regression analysis effectively.
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:13:30
So when the bank seizes the wallets and steals the coins? Then what?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:47:22
You can't. Private keys are created using many SHA and other encryption functions and brute forcing using GPUs doesn't work since parallelization is hampered by the algorithm to encrypt. So, never.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:58:07
Because having a free market like we have for cryptocurrencies drives innovation.
@_date: 2015-01-11 05:32:01
I'm sorry, I don't believe that has anything to do with the point I'm making and you are wooshing past.
See, litecoin doesn't need to be a great investment, or make people rich, or save the world. It already did a ton of legwork simply existing which allowed bitcoin to grow further.
Cute argument.
@_date: 2015-01-11 04:53:13
Were you unaware that the guy who first started working on litecoin made most of the contributions to bitcoin as it rose to its place of fame?
Cause if that's not innovation to you I don't know what is. Good try at being snide though!
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:32:33
Wanna reread what you just said? It sounds preposterous. Litecoin and bitcoin are equally there in the world, bitcoin just started it.
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:03:19
I don't understand your goals with the ad hominem. Good luck with the fallacious arguments. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:11:54
I hope you don't think this only happens in movies.
@_date: 2015-01-11 07:34:14
I'm sure if you keep saying it, it will be true at some point.
@_date: 2014-05-07 19:10:14
My point is they're saying "HEY LOOK R^2 AND REGRESSION SHOWS CORRELATION GUYS!" when they don't even know how to use linear regression analysis properly.

Ever heard of Zimbabwe? This is how we start going in that direction.
Do you realize we are in a thread discussing inflation? I can taste the irony.

I can tell you that every single retailer and online store would raise their prices to compensate. To think this wouldn't happen is foolish.
I'm just telling you it's a bad idea, I never said I know how to solve this.

He's listening to his customers. I personally don't understand why 2.96 is "almost 4 euro" because it's actually almost 3 euro. This is going to end up being cheaper than most exchanges if you get a large amount on one card... 3 euro is really not bad at all for a paper wallet.

And back to $5 for a few months after.

You're forgetting that power to run these things costs money. Difficulty is also always rising, so you get less bitcoins as time ticks along.

@_date: 2013-05-30 18:38:16
Get your head out of your ass then. How about the fact that he has even created this thread? There's more discussion than "It's too expensive" if you would try to read the other comments. It's clear this cost is a sunk cost. $7 isn't a whole lot to pay for what you're getting.  
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:08:50


It's a bad title. Let's use our brains and come up with a better one, while still conserving all the karma you're trying to get:
"Bug discovered in currency wiping out 1/3 of woman's life savings."
Was that so hard? Sensationalism is bullshit and you did it in the title, fair and square. 


Yeah, try just reading the title instead of digging a hole of grammar. It says her savings was wiped out, which would imply it was *completely* gone.
But no, just loves the sensationalist bullshit.
Fuck **you** this time.
