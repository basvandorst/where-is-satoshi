Its for messing around with for fun with spare insignificant amounts cash you have. But thats  about it, nothing else. Definitely wouldn't say it's worth nothing though, it is the future pretty much, big banks are starting trading them
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:51:20

Why do you get offended by bad BTC news? 
Why the emotional attachment? bad things happen when you stop being objective, especially in the investing world
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:21:07
