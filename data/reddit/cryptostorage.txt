The keys are generated offline so they are ideally never exposed to an internet-connected device.
As others have said, a transaction can be signed on an offline computer then broadcast from an internet-connected computer so the private keys are never exposed to an internet-connected device.

I'm pleased to announce [cryptostorage.com](
cryptostorage.com is an open-source tool to create offline storage for multiple cryptocurrencies.  This tool generates [key pairs]( in your device's browser which can store cryptocurrency without exposing private keys to an internet-connected device.  Generated key pairs can be easily printed and saved to digital files for long-term storage.
This tool is security-focused.  Funds are never entrusted to a third party.  Private keys can be passphrase-protected and [split into pieces]( which can be geographically separated so funds are not accessible at any one location.  Recommendations are automatically provided to improve the security of the tool's environment.

Bitcoin’s white paper describes a cheap peer-to-peer electronic cash.  Who cares about that?  A lot of people.

Bitcoin Cash continues the vision described in Bitcoin’s white paper, as a peer-to-peer electronic cash, not a high-fee settlement system.
