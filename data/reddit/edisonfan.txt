You are quite optimistic guy. My forecast - two years. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:50:06
There will be none.
The decentralized nature of bitcoin will prevent any one place from being the center of bitcoin related transactions.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:04:25
Is his new album as awesome as your experience of using bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:58:30
Haha. Looks funny. Now i wonna taste it.

@_date: 2014-06-21 17:11:55
Everything happens for the first time
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:49:47
Donate 15 to Sean's Outpost and spend 5 on a new gaming rig.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:49:53
Yeah. So? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:57:25
What this topic about? 
What you want to tell me?
What's wrong with your point of view and BTC? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:03:51
"Bitcoin expert"? Is it a thing?
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:23:40
But if you have a banhammer, those nails will hate you for your RO regulations lol
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:03:22
Not to a whole system but it can improve a number of users somehow
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:04:46
They will build democracy in your own country to find you and judge you! 
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:44:09
There is nothing bad in believing in some stupid shit. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:39:15
No. That was suddenly even for me. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:19:19
That sir is kinda genius! He's know what he talking about
@_date: 2014-08-18 06:48:37
This thread is getting ridiculous...
Although a bitcoin party in the isnlands would be amazing.
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:45:40
Lol. That's why i never talk about BTC at my work.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:19:40




How can you regulate TCP/IP?
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:11:30
Interesing article. But i'm not totally agree with it. 
I'm also doesn't agree with mr. Tucker. I think that he is an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:39:49
I love it. Any options like buyback will make Bitcoin more... userfriendly.
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:05:11
Hah, it looks just like a drug addict recognition.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:14:57
I've heard that your method with bait can attract only a bear with balalaika.
Damn i'm in love with this stereotypes!
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:02:10
Wow, you guys opened my eyes. It was a great surprise to me to learn that California is so good at bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:44:42
I've got one. Thanks you man for saving my ass from BTC scams
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:54:50
I believe that $100 000 bitcoin is impossible for a couple of reasons
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:45:37
Why not? If they have a lot of power and they are working with hardware - they could use their workplace for mining =D
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:38:38
Oh i got you. There is a difference between them. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:37:53
What country are you from? Because imo people in the west are know a way more then an eastern europeans 
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:55:36
Thx you for the link. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:52:50
Who is he? Didn't see his name before
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:54:15
You should read Peter Todd instead of seeing a lof of discussions on getting miners to move to p2pool.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:02:55
Do not force this events!
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:53:25
Best. Bitcoin. Joke. Ever. =_=
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:54:20
*a rapid succession of beats sounded on a drum, often used to introduce an announcement or event.*
Finally! Finally they decided to accept Bitcoins!
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:19:02
Nice article! 
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:29:29
Why you want to convince people if you don't give a shit about them? 
BTC don't need it. Btc needs to become strong and the only way to do it - use bitcoins in the biggest shops and economis systems. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:51:38
Sometimes BTC subreddit need trolls. Without them our life was bored...
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:29:08
It's not the best explanation but it show us what bitcoin can do and why they are so important
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:06:01
Lol. your joke made my day. Thx you bro.
I'm actually happy that i have one more way to spend my Bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:37:12
Are you sure about that?
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:59:35
Why do you need to decentralize everything? 
And how it's supposed to help bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:15:04
You can't stop it. Two great pillars support censorhip: people and government. 
If you can run away from government resourses, you will never run away from people. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:10:10
Sir Jeffrey seems to be an idiot. 
Even a homeless child from Senegal knows a way more about Bitcoin that mr. Tucker. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:30:56
So you should throw your avast away. It makes me bleeding. Avast said that my BTC miner isn't clean
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:47:52
Thx you. Maybe one day i'll install my own bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:43:33
Now i see that two things that hookers prefer are making  wordplay and accept bitcoins, quack quack.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:56:45
Good for you, coz i'm  big fan of rap music too, but sometimes people are quite disappointed after buing new album. Especially when they spend bitocins to buy it.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:50:26
If you want to keep your bitcoins safe - do not visit strange services. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:52:58
Bitcoin rocket? 
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:58:12
So? What medias are not bullshit? Who in Europe knows much more about cryptocurrency then the others? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:04:00
Should they give a shit about this?
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:24:51
Wow. You know how to waste your time.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:47:03
Lol. I must to admit that Argentinian peso has more liquidity then a BTC even if it more cheaper
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:21:32
Legalize? Bitcoins are illegal in USA? What a stupid joke
@_date: 2014-06-21 16:11:13
Whoa whoa whoa. 
Now you can see the moon because of your bitcoins. In other words, digital currency makes you closer to the moon!
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:24:21
Clarification is most important thing in human relations
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:02:36
Bloodyhell! Is it difficult to activate your own BTC ATM? 
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:01:19
Imo modern BTC community shouldn't watch for what TED talks about Bitcoin. TED talks seems to be a waste of time for me that's why i'd rather read a shit load of topic on reddit but never go to the TED.com
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:32:07
So, since you expain it sounds amazing. 
I can only wish a good luck to citizens of whole California!
@_date: 2014-06-28 16:45:17
That's a good reason to visit Geneva.
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:53:08
What's a lovely February for BTC
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:50:45
Can't wait for the same on the android.
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:01:41
How old your dad is? 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:23:56
Man just stop spitting random words, ok? 
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:49:38
Porn payment? Another headache to the adult websites instead of making content. 
Sometime bitcoin users went to far... 
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:48:07
What about ASICs then?
