The only one that makes any sense you shillbot

So you really believe this is all just being driven by pure greed? This will all collapse soon? Im starting to feel that way more and more.. Everyone one here seems to be poor people trying to get rich quick. I have yet to speak to someone who has had a successful life finacally that thinks this is a good investment. My dad did the wall street thing for 20 years and he also thinks this is a huge scam.. you said it though.. people don't want to hear that! People actually get mad when you tell them it was unwise to put their money in bitcoin.

We'll look at you Gordon Gekko! :)

Great. So you're telling me bitcoin is just an enormous community of hipster doofuses trying to challenge the system but in reality have zero clue about what they're talking about or doing?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:30:17
Right... This page is not helping me at all. The very last thing in the world im gonna take financial advice from is a fucking meme
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:33:18
So you can just send your coins from coinbase into a hardware wallet and when you do that u get access to the keys? I've been wondering about this. This is kinda what I felt when I bought from coinbase.. I didn't buy coins.. I bought and IOU to coins. Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:59
Yeah they are. The people who know what theyre doing and making serious money aren't jerking off on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:23:48
ah I know the people didn't ask for this dude.. Im sorry I wasn't trying to be insensitive. Just out of curiosity.. about how much was all that worth in USD before everything went bad there? Are there people using Bitcoin as an actual currency? I don't understand how people can be using it as a currency when the value of it is taking roller coaster rides everyday.. anyway Im sorry! I hope you and your family are all okay

208 bitcoins?? They stole over 2 million dollars from you?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:09:36
holy fuck... See this is why I'm still scared of all of this stuff. I only invested 100$ to try to start learning about this and I don't even feel good about having that much in it. Damn man.. best of luck getting it back! Thats fucking crazy
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:36:17
No one on here knows what the fuck they are talking about.. You're gonna have to do your own research
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:15:56


100% correct. The Bitcoin page hasn't helped even a little bit. In fact its done the exact opposite and scared me out of this. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:20
Lol everyone on here thinks theyre Gordon Gekko. Ive been using this page to learn what not to do
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:22:29
It is fun to watch the money grow though aint it?? My investment has grown by 25 percent in like a week
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:33:27
This page is a circle jerk. No body on here has any clue what theyre talking about. If you want to get into this I suggest you do some serious research and ignore these retarded memes. Do not get sucked into this by greed. Do some real research
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:29:54
Not by asking questions here. Go on the real internet and do some fucking research jesus christ

What happened? Socialism not work out the way you thought it would?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:49:47
Get ready for another kid then :)

You should probably get a job

They're mad because they themselves never actually went to the moon. Elon is doing what they had to fake!
