The price of Energy per bitcoin transaction is determined by market rate for a transaction fee.
Since it takes electricity to design, manufacture, and run miners, all parts of the vertical integration require electricity.

Yes, the classic dream of "being a millionaire" is visions of fast cars, big houses, lavish vacations, basically spending a million dollars. The few lucky lottery winners who do achieve this dream find out that once the million is gone, it's gone forever.
The reality of being a millionaire is a frugal person consistently buying Berkshire Hathaway shares, living a low-expense lifestyle. The only way to keep the million... is to not spend it. haha!

There is a large difference between collateral and exposure. 
I can have 100% of my net worth in bitcoin and physical gold, hedge it with on-exchange shorts for the exact same amount, and have 0 exposure to both markets. The price can go roller coaster and my net worth will never change. If the exchanges close down or disappear, I am left with physical gold and my Bitcoin private keys.
Hedge funds, on the other hand, don't need the security of private keys. They have legal avenues to sue for misconduct, and are insured for such endeavours. If futures can help them get exposure to the bitcoin market it can only be a good thing.

But first, ride it up and make your fortune. It will get as insane as 2013, but bigger and more euphoric this time around.

Basically the network effect - the preexisting infrastructure paves the way for even more infrastructure. From a purely technological perspective litecoin has an advantage over bitcoin, but since bitcoin was the first coin conceived, it maintains its status as the big daddy.

The biggest problem facing bitcoin right now is the confirmation time when transactions occur on chain. With 6 confirmations, an average wait of 1 hour is just too high. Moving bitcoins around while staring dumbly at a computer screen waiting for confirmations is simply not acceptable in the fast paced financial and stock markets. 
Although I have confidence that virtual currency will one day become hugely successful, there is no doubt that Bitcoin will not be the dominant currency for the aforementioned reason. It does, however, demonstrate the commerce potential of virtual currencies and sets a high bar for whichever currency will surpass Bitcoin.

What I would like to draw attention to is that although Bitcoin is certainly quite fast in terms of confirmation time, the 1 hour/6 confirmation time will certainly be improved upon by a coin that is scripted differently. Take Litecoin, for example. It has every feature Bitcoin has, except that confirmations take place 4x faster (2.5 minutes instead of 10). However, that small advantage is not enough for Litecoin to overtake the Network Effect from Bitcoin's longer existance. 
Undoubtedly, there will one day be a cryptocoin that surpasses Bitcoin in enough ways to warrant a large scale switch. Thus I am pointing out that the confirmation time is one of the main pitfalls of Bitcoin that can be improved upon.
