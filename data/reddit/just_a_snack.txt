Literally days before it collapsed. 
When John Stewart brought him on his show and put him on blast was so funny.
I will admit though, back in 07/08 when I was getting into investing I bought his books, it was still a good primer to get me into it, but glad I dropped that guy and moved on quick.

He may not have contributed a lot of code, but the guy has a masters in cs with a focus on distributed systems. I'm an sde but could never hack an ms degree and distributed systems are complex even at a high level it gets difficult to follow. 
Basically to say he has a shallow understanding because he doesn't push a lot of code is not in any way an accurate measurement of understanding. 
Additionally I write a ton of code working on side projects outside of work and most of it never makes it to github. When you have as much popularity as him people will do what you are doing and start trying to discredit him for his public code so he is likely more hesitant to push code now because of scrutiny.

$700k and by next week he'll probably be a millionaire without another single donation. Pretty awesome the support he has received.

That's the same person who gave  1btc the other day. Whoever this person is, they're pretty awesome and truly care about supporting bitcoin.

Here's some recent discussion on it, 
There's a handful of companies doing IPFS but Filecoin has the big VC names behind it.

I asked some graduating MBA students at a bar on Friday if they've heard of bitcoin. They've only heard of it in passing basically. Both said it was worthless and they would never buy into it. I asked one of the women what would have to be done for btc to be worth $1 in their opinions. She said you'd have to be able to buy beer with it. 
I explained there are bitcoin debt cards which she was really surprised about. Even after saying that however, she was not convinced.
Adoption rate is going to be slow for people who aren't interested in 'get rich quick' schemes. I say that because that's how bitcoin is being labelled as now. Look at all the focus on here about price points and memes, news articles all focus on that aspect.
However because bitcoin is easily purchased globally I think there is still a massive pool of people who will become interested in it and eventually the people who are hesitant will soften up to the idea of it.

NASDAQ is small game compared to CME for futures. They appear to be rolling it out a lot better than CME is however by pulling data from many sources.

Just the thought of futures trading tomorrow is causing the price to drop hard right now. Today through Monday are going to be pretty interesting to see.

lol you think companies don't kill pensions retroactively to people who have already paid into them? There is no guarantees, except maybe more whining in this thread.
