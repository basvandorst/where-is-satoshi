Just a word of caution regarding your statement about AML/KYC being the sole responsibility of banks.  That's a misstatement if you are actively trading.   By engaging the wrong parties, individuals who may be involved in illegal activities, or who participate in questionable activities, you are exposing yourself to situations like these.   For the small trader this isn't an issue.  But once you reach significant volumes you fall on the compliance team scope and they will definitely look into your transaction patterns.  You stated that you haven't done anything out of the ordinary, so I'm inclined to think that the issue comes from a third party, either someone you buy from, or someone you selling to.   So anyone growing into a larger trader must understand that it does matter who you deal with.

I don't know what jurisdiction you're located at (and there's no need to state it, as it makes not major difference), but something that's common within LE is that ongoing investigations are mostly kept secret until they either indict or dismiss the case.  
There is a ton of compliance-related information out there, enough to become yourself very well versed on risk management, due diligence, enhanced due diligence, and KYC.  A problem I've noticed in the early adopters of BTC is that they insist on moving along the anonymity and "mind your own business" mantra that has been part of Bitcoin since the inception.  But at this time Bitcoin has become a commodity that has real value, and it falls within the jurisdiction of many agencies throughout the world.  
Let me just share a little nugget of wisdom:  if you sell or buy BTC and you are approached by someone who states that they are involved in illegal activities, your duty is to report that to the authorities.  Don't look the other way.  For all you know, they may be part of an undercover operation and looking the other way (called willful blindness) will most likely result in forfeiture of your funds, and possibly other charges.
Legit users of BTC must start to think of it just like your fiat currency.  Don't do anything stupid with it, respect BTC as you respect your fiat, and apply the same common sense you would apply to any operations conducted with fiat currency.

Yes I agree!  Besides it works like a charm.  Try some LTC and you’ll see. LOL
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:02:15
I've said this before and I will say it again. BTC is an investment commodity. When it was designed, Satoshi didn't take into account the sheer amount of transactions that take place every second worldwide through regular financial channels. 
Therefore, no matter what it is done to BTC, it will never be an effective transactional channel for mainstream consumers. Things such as the 10 min confirmations and high fees are a huge deterrent.  Most likely alt coins will provide such functionality.  For example LTC with its 2 min confirmation is a much more viable crypto for commerce.

Truecrypt and other volume encryption utilities can be cracked by means of a memory dump.  It seems the keys remain in RAM and can be retrieved with a forensic tool.  The encrypted volume has to be open when the memory dump takes place.  So yeah, deemed not secure anymore.

Unless you are a W2 employee, and assuming you are in the US, and assuming your employer is hitting you with the full 3% of the check amount against your tip, you should be able to issue a 1099 to your employer (because he/she is not having the expense, and that becomes actual revenue), and you should be able to declare that as an expense (because you did earn the full tip, and were forced to incur the expense of the fee).
Your employer will be extremely upset and that may trigger an IRS audit for your employer.  Payback is a b.....

Also bitcoin addresses may change with time for many reasons, security, human error (ie. you didn't backup your wallet before your phone crashed) etc.  So it would lead eventually to a lot of dead end addresses.
As to private key sharing, you'd be surprised.  Family members would probably share the account, and this may span several states and/or countries. 
Good intentions though.  Keep up with the ideas.

Inasmuch as Bitcoin makes the US government (and many other governments) uneasy for the obvious lack of centralized control, etc. prohibition / ban seems unlikely.  There are too many examples of the catastrophic failure to recognize the power of the Internet (e.g. Blockbuster and Netflix).  As long as Bitcoin is used as an alternative mean of commerce and doesn't not pose a threat to substitute the all mighty Dollar, it should be fine.  
After all what the government doesn't like about Bitcoin is that they can't just "add a few billion to the ledger" at will, as they currently do when they need more money.
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:05:39
The problem stems from Bitcoin effectively entering the financial world.  Satoshi's child has all the necessary elements to revolutionize how people do business.  However, dropping such new concept on a highly-organized industry run by multi-billion banks and credit card companies among others, and highly regulated in virtually any country was bound to a rocky start, one way or the other.
SR was indeed one of the first scenarios that opened the eyes of the industry about the real, existing risk of cryptocurrencies in connection with criminal activity.
US laws are definitely questionable in many ways, and the system is far from perfect.  Impunity for the rich is a given, and this leaves the Bitcoin community at a high risk from regulatory, law enforcement, and even civil actions.
Shrem did not properly controlled risk.  A person selling bitcoin to someone, without any knowledge of what the buyer will do is one thing.  But selling bitcoin knowing that it will be used for criminal activities is completely different, and this is why CS ended up having to plea without too many options for a reasonable defense.
On the other end he was not charged with money laundering. The reason is simple.  Money laundering only occurs when the money or value in question involves the proceeds of criminal activity.  That's a sine qua non requirement for money laundering statutes to be applicable.
The only way Bitcoin will live in our society is by properly dealing with regulation, making sure every aspect of risk is properly addressed, and prevent (and report) any suspicious or criminal activity.  There is no other way.
I'm sure CS's unfortunate fate will keep many Bitcoin enthusiasts and entrepreneur on a much alert state.
As to the big banks, its time for the USAO to really step up their game and lock up some of those crooked bankers who knowingly and willfully laundered billions for the cartels.  Replacing those bank officers can be done easily.  Rebuilding the trust in the legal system, that's a different tune.

If anyone run into similar problems file a strong complaint with your state banking department.
Paypal is a money transmitter, not a bank.  In many states they are not authorized to hold or "lock" funds for more than a few days. If you read their agreement, paypal acts as your agent. They hold funds on your behalf, but they do not hold title to the money. In short, absent a court order, they may be illegally depriving you from access to your assets.  
If you have a bank account linked to your paypal account, banks are held to a higher standard than money transmitters (with more leeway to lock your funds than any money transmitter). Paypal must comply with your local jurisdiction money transmitter rules, including meeting the requirement for time of delivery of your funds.
That said, PP has a long story of abusive practices such as impossing penalties or "fines" (which are not authorized under any statute for money transmitters).
Make sure you learn and understand your local money transmitter statutes before filing a claim.

I beg to differ.  Bitcoin users are much more careful as they know transactions are not reversible and there is no one to bitch at but yourself. People that use Western Union come with the perception that WU is looking out for their safety.  Truth is WU is just in for the money.  Thanks to their ripping off mexicans on the exhange rate, regulation now forces full disclosure of exhange rates and the fact that they will profit from the transaction's exchange of currency on top of the fees.

In Florida money transmitters are required to have a bond (as well as in many other states). Whenever there is a scam, the bond will respond for the loses of the victims.
That is an advantage that gives people a level of assurance that doesnt exist on a pure bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:59:02
It is a matter of time.  Western Union follows an old business model which has rarely been exposed for some of its darkest pitfalls.
While Bitcoin is still on its infancy, its dangers are well known: losing coins due to hacking/theft, the use of the currency anonymity for illegal activity, creative regulatory and legal burdens ahead, etc.
But no one mentions that crooks have relied on Western Union's reputation to conduct worldwide fraud schemes.  Western Union is supposed to comply with risk-based policies to prevent money laundering and other criminal activity going through their networks, and yet the proliferation of fraud, from the Nigerian 419 scam down to the alleged kidnapping of relatives demanding ransom has been successful due to Western Union's failure to successfully prevent said activity that hurts thousands of people every year.  And many of them trusted Western Union to protect them.  And do not forget that MoneyGram paid a big fine as it was found it was profiting from fraud activity, when it was aware that many transactions met the fraud pattern.
Just saying...

Makes sense. My concern has to do with the fact that, for example, on the credit card industry, there are tens of millions of transactions carried out daily.

Usually yes.  But I would try to reach out to the banking department where their HQ is located because that puts a lot of pressure on them, especially if they are ignoring your requests.

Afaik they are in the US. According to federal law, they are considered money transmitters. Depending on the state you are located, you may have the option of filing a claim with the banking department.  Generally money transmitters are bonded.

Upvoted for bringing in common sense.  What happened to "be your own bank"? Get a hardware wallet and don't let a third party control your money.  One of the issues that annoy me the most of banks is that entitlement to tell you what you can and cannot do with your money.

Keep in mind that as the virtual currency becomes mainstream, a lot of regulated players join the game.  For the most part those regulated players follow all the rules and regulations, including designing and implementing controls and monitoring tools to detect questionable activity and report it to the authorities.
ANY currency is vulnerable to use by criminal actors.  Cryptocurrencies are just too new to the industry and the tools available aren't strong or reliable enough (yet) to bring the game to a comfortable level to the largest players.  But it is a matter of time.
While it is true that currently Bitcoin has been mostly associated with criminal activity, it is also quite possible that a practical, large scale implementation (probably in the field of micro payments where traditional fiat infrastructure can't compete due to cost restrains) may be a breakthrough that brings the technology to be of widespread use.  An example would be micro payments on e-mails, to avoid or virtually eliminate spam.   
@_date: 2016-09-14 00:45:12
Not as easy as the article makes it look. Almost all states in the US have specific money transmitter requirements and KYC rules that must be followed, and there are many other laws such as OFAC which bring regulatory risk to this kind of service that may make worldwide deployment not practical.  Bitcoin wallet to wallet without a middleman is much more feasible than a middleman that must comply with a world of rules virtually everywhere.

That´s the point.  Bitcoin has the unique feature where you can indeed handle your own currency without any third party.  The problem is that the technology is not there yet when this can be done mainstream without people losing their keys or getting them stolen.  But whoever can bring secure and reliable  and idiot proof technology to the masses, will open the flood gates.
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:23:46
File a complaint with the Office of Financial Regulation.   Florida Statutes 560.208(5) require that a money transmitter (Paypal is licensed in Florida and everywhere else) must make the money available to the designated recipient within 10 days after receipt.
Paypal is bullshitting you.  They cannot hold your money unless the person is actually a Specially Designated National according the the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.  And if he is in Miami, he's definitely not subject to any sanction lists.
So call in the regulator, I'm sure Paypal has a lot of explaining to do, and it may cost them a hefty fine of a few thousand dollars.
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:52:39
It is more complicated than that.  Bitcoin is supposed to give you a degree of freedom you currently don't have under the current banking industry.  You put your hard earned money in a bank, and the bank can play games with you, charge you fees for situations they conveniently manipulated to generate profit, and what's more important, they can exclude anyone from having an account, based on any excuse or none at all, simply won't take your business.
There's a lot more, but that's just a starting point.

Anonymity is about the individual,  not the crypt currency itself.   We don't live in a world without consequences and rules.   Sadly typically those who are dealing in gray/shady industries are the ones that benefit the most out anonymity, while the vast majority who are legitimate users should have nothing to worry about limited privacy.  Moat governments know how much you have in fiat to a great degree of precision, yet people live their lives uneventful.   The greatest threat to cryptos are the bad actors who use it for illegal shit. Because of them adoption slows down,  and law enforcement is all over everyone.   After all, if a government wants to keep BTC out of their territory they can,  by making it as illegal as heroin.   Let's be practical and smart about this.
