I don't understand why this is gonna be bad for scaling. Bitcoin keeps working the same way. No problems in it. Maybe this will be bad for the price now but if there is really a demand for Bitcoin the business are going to migrate to other country.

The price of bitcoin will be less volatile and less dependent to the desires of the Chinese (people, exchanges and government) . The demand of bitcoin  will be more stable and descentralized.
