Don’t do it
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:31:50
Yea. I’m considering doing videos but don’t want to sound like jr business. It’s really cringy when you see people with not a shred of knowledge telling people what to buy with out any research or even the slightest idea about what they speak of. I don’t know a lot but I spend hours reading and researching coins so I have a basic grasp on the subject 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:12:10
It’s prolly a turn your pc into a remote miner for him 
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:38:47
How not. The title of the actual video is deconstruction of a crane. What does any of this have to do with bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:34:58

I’m actually starting one with my friends 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:19:36
How hard is it to use your debit card. And not your credit card. Like it’s not even your money on a credit card. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:35:47
You make a valid point. But I didn’t even know you could buy them with a cc until they started banning it. I assumed it wouldn’t work because it’s credit and not really your money. Because I know a few services that are like nope you need a debit card not a cc.  I just feel using a credit card for investing in general would be a bad move. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:09
Credit cards are not your money. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:20:40
Yea but why would you loan money on bitcoin. Like that’s the dumbest thing you could do.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:22:34
Lol can I thank you now 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:58:29
I didn’t know that because I never thought of trying it. Like logic wise it just seems so weird. Because let’s say I had decent credit my cards not maxed out but I’m at the border of bankruptcy I could of said let me max my card out and then file for bankruptcy and wait this out. I mean buying in at 20 k would suck but imagine doing it when btc is nice and cheap. You could fuck so much stuff up.  
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:04:21
I get notifications for flagging it 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:19:53
Some people seem really confused by that simple concept.
