This is not fine, I had etc and sold it - 5 to 10 minutes before shoot down site bitfinex, and now should I pay 70% of my btc? There are individual accounts so, that accounts which was hacked should have 0 balance and other that didn't hacked should normal balances.

I see one problem with activation bip91. The proposal is btc1+bip91, not core+bip91.What will it happen when bip91 win and what's next?  Will core developers develop further bitcoin or they will give up?
