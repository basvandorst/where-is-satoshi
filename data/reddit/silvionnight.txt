You're not wrong. A few weeks ago everyone was talking about it because prices were at ATH and Bitcoin was breaking record after record. Now we're moving sideways. Once it goes back up again there will be news headlines all over and you'll hear your dentist talking about it again.

Trx is absolute rubbish. Rife with conflict of interest partnerships, pre-mined coins locked up (read:owned) by the CEO and a whitepaper full of buzz words and little content. I'll pass.

You could be in limbo for quite a while. Eventually it'll get through.

Same here! The only downside is that nowadays the minimum purchase is 1k euros and minimum withdrawal is 500 euros due to the heavy traffic.

Er... are you okay? I can explain the NEO versus GAS thing: hodling NEO in your NEO wallet automatically generates GAS. GAS is a crypto that is used to initiate actions on the NEO blockchain (fund transactions, creating smart contracts etc). More importantly though it acts as a dividend, as you can sell the GAS token on exchanges.

In the northern hemisphere it will be slightly chilly. In the southern hemisphere things could be a bit hot. I'm also fairly sure January will have 31 days and February will likely have 28 days. Oh, and Bitcoin will go up, down, or sideways.

It's the word "hold" misspelled by a drunk Bitcoin forum visitor back in 2013.

That's nothing. Some days ago one of the ice skaters (I believe it was the guy that won the 1500m men's race) shilled cryptos on national television. The journalist asked what the men's team were talking about and he replied that the entire day, all they do is talk about cryptos.

For one, its not paper. Also, a hardware wallet is encrypted and with it you can easily access your funds without you having to enter your keys in a desktop app, which is quite risky due to the danger of for example keyloggers. And it looks cool.

He said "tetherboy FUD", meaning FUD spread by investors that tethered saying BTC would drop further. Over the past weeks they've done this in the hopes of reaching what OP tried to do; buy back in lower.
