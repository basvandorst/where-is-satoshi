If it’s use is made illegal by governments. Most citizens are law abiding and they would then not use or store bitcoin. It would be pretty much destroyed.

It’s not just “jealousy” of someone doing a bit better than you financially. It’s perfectly logical to fear people who become fabulously wealthy because of the power that wealth brings them. Hence it is perfectly rational to compete with and restrain these people so the disparity in power is a little less.

You may be right. I assume that there is finite probability of loss so given time all will be lost if there are a finite number of storage apaches. But I agree not very likely. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 23:03:14
That is fine if the risk can be reasonably estimated. Can the risk of going long/short on margin on a crypto exchange be estimated confidently.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:48:34
I think the exception is that if major Governments introduce state back cryptos ie backed by the dollar or euro. Use of bitcoin may then fall away. Citizens would like this scenario as they do not want a random group of bitcoin hodlers to become fabulously wealthy in exchange for nothing.

It has a long way to go to get to the 80 Trillion. In particular there has to be the demand to make the price go up. What I think you need (eg in the US) is many highly crypto friendly politicians.

Pension funds won’t invest in Bitcoin. Why should they bother to take the risk.
@_date: 2018-09-15 19:39:53
Bitcoin does not have a fixed supply because of all the forks and also because of competing currencies. The  control of the money supply to help to control inflation is much easier for fiat than crypto.
Bitcoin is not censorship proof and beyond government control. All that is necessary is for governments to declare Bitcoin or its use illegal. That will destroy bitcoin. Why ? Because the majority of citizens are law abiding and accept that they should not evade paying tax. Thus if Bitcoin is made illegal they would not use it.
@_date: 2018-09-15 22:49:45
A few countries banning it would slow bitcoin down. Private currencies do get banned. Or they gradually fail as currencies and disappear, this might be the fate of bitcoin.

Yes it’s a great idea like Theranos multiple tests from a single drop of blood. Problem is they both are based on fundamentally flawed technology. Oh and people would have used the Theranos product if it had worked, but nobody interested in actually using bitcoin. And as a store of value people prefer gold (if they don’t have stocks). Most people in the world have some gold and they like it, bitcoin has a long way to go for any kind of adoption for storing value.

You need to approach the major employers in your area and persuade them to pay the salaries of their employees in bitcoin. Try to discuss this with local politicians.

We are fortunate if we live in countries like the US or EU countries that central banks can print or reduce the supply of fiat currency. Thus inflation can be controlled within limits to target as far as possible optimal rates eg 2% inflation.  Thus growth and economies can be boosted for the benefit of citizens.

If retail investors are able to buy a bitcoin/crypto ETF thus avoiding the risks of owning a wallet etc it would seem majority of investors would go for this. In this case what would happen to the current exchanges such as Coinbase and Bitfinex. Would they sell the ETFs also ?
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:51:43
And another query. I can see bitcoin being useful for young tech savvy mobile people, but what about say old people perhaps living alone in Venezuela who do not have any smart phone or laptop etc. Of course for them the bolivar is not going to be useful either. But they might be able to trade physical possessions.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:35:39
I read that some prospective ETF providers would have insurance, some not. But the insurance must be expensive in proportion to how poor your security measures are. I guess if you need expensive insurance its not a good advertisement. And would the cost of the insurance be passed to the customer.
If I want to say buy some Apple shares it’s easy, I log in to my brokerage which I have been using for decades and with a few clicks I have the shares. And I’m not frightened of losing them to a hack. This is what bitcoin needs, as easy as this.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:30:32
I assume they must have some fair BTC assets for some time. But how could it be possible for a Venezuelan with no BTC to get some. They probably couldn’t buy it with bolivars. I guess they could barter some assets they have produced or own for the BTC ?
@_date: 2018-08-04 18:51:03
So the picture of bitcoin resembles a valuable fiat coin ? Surely something wrong there.
@_date: 2018-05-06 08:19:23
Who knows Bitcoin might be banned in future. If it is banned the vast majority of people would not use it because they would not want to break the law. Apart from ease of transfer gold is more attractive for other reasons, for example its material reality, its technological uses and uses in Jewellery for which there is massive demand. Nobody can predict the future but it now seems most unlikely given our current financial system, at least in advanced countries, that owning gold bars would be banned again. Also although transfer of bitcoin is easy,  all the stories of people losing their bitcoin or getting it stolen through minor errors really puts people off bitcoin, and other cryptos.

Three characteristics/features/criteria are given. There is one additional feature of organic life on earth which bitcoin could challenge for.

Thereafter it could evolve into something which is not bitcoin at all.

Fiat will die when everyone has their pensions, salaries, wages paid in bitcoin, and perhaps when the supporters of cryptos somehow manage to engineer, in advanced countries, massive inflation of fiat in opposition to central banks. I live in a town of about 150K and know many many people and I’ve not come across yet anyone having their pension or salary paid in bitcoin. We are a long long long way off from even approaching a situation in which fiat is threatened.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:44:28
If you and the seller both really want to make the deal, what about persuading the seller to set up Paypal, you could help him. Probably easier and safer anyway than using bitcoin.

I don’t disagree with you too much. Except that I think there is a link between its physical properties and trading value. Would gold be traded for such price if it were dull grey in colour and not attractive in appearance. We cannot be sure but I think historically the prettiness is important.
From World Gold Council site figures I estimate 87.5 billion USD demand for gold for jewellery in 2017. How much USD has actually gone into crypto.
For jewellery there is also a clearly demand independent of fluctuations in price. Thus if a couple are getting married they will buy rings for whatever price whether gold is 1200 or 400.

It seems reasonable in the current environment that big holders and whales will be trying to offload some of their coins for assets with intrinsic value such as jewellery and gold etc. And there will be a feel good factor for the whales if they can adopt their crypto without converting to fiat. I am sure that the clever jewellers realise this.
@_date: 2018-10-27 17:40:25
Does your analysis take account that people in general and governments also might decide that they want nothing to do with crypto. One reason is that, in the case of bitcoin, people might not wish to make early adopters fabulously wealthy in exchange for ... well for nothing. A second reason is simply that people will lose interest and just continue using the fiat system with their credit cards etc.
Edit I was reading in last day or so that the Royal Mint in the UK had decided not to go ahead with a crypto project.

If I am adopting bitcoin to buy groceries or a bottle of wine etc I want that the cost in satoshis will be roughly the same in a few weeks time as now. I don't want to be at the mercy of merchants doing fancy calculations to profit off me because of rapid inflation or deflation of bitcoin in the short term.
If some whales got together to form an entity like a central bank they could release or pull in bitcoin to control inflation, though a little bit of inflation might be good for the bitcoin economy.

I understand your argument it is used many times. I think what you miss in here is human nature. If the public come to hate these early investors for some reason, that’s end of story for this particular tech. The public will deliberately not buy in.

I’ve seen several of these both in US and Europe, and on some occasions have been able to pass by them regularly. I’ve never ever seen any of them being used. By contrast nearby fiat ATMs often have lines of people. One could say that it’s early days for Bitcoin adoption. But now it certainly appears that the supply of Bitcoin ATMs very much exceeds the demand. Actually it’s bad publicity for Bitcoin to see these machines largely unused.

No I am a kind person. I’m just saying really that people have a choice on how to spend their money. They could buy shares in a big company or support a start-up or they could buy crypto or all of these. They may not want to buy shares in a particular company and enrich the owners of this company for some reason or not want to participate in the crypto scene and enrich the early adopters. It is freedom of choice which we all want in a free society. Actually the current stable price action in BTC etc might encourage people to adopt the currency who were previously opposed to crypto, even if they are opposed to bitcoin as an investment.

Well the guy might have a lot of crypto in some accounts somewhere. This could be for a variety of reasons, including that it is all legit because he got in early. It would be anathema I think to most crypto enthusiasts that this guy should have to reveal these accounts to the tax authorities. But I think there is going to be no escape.
I live in UK and have never had problems, touchwood, with tax authorities. I heard some stories from years ago that the guy with the Bugatti could receive a bill from tax authorities for say 100K with cover letter saying ... we have assessed your lifestyle and decided that to afford a Bugatti this must be your salary and this is what you owe in unpaid tax. It is then his responsibility to prove the tax bill is wrong not the other way around. I thought that in practice the guy would phone up the tax authorities and bargain with them and they could say OK we’ll let you off with 50K but if you behave badly in future watch out !

I agree that technology opens up new doors. So in a decade the doors opened by bitcoin might make way for new evolutionary innovation which makes bitcoin redundant. It might or it might not. Definitely IF people see the benefits things will take off. I feel that some supporters of crypto live in a bit of a bubble and have not succeeded in convincing people well.

It doesn’t matter because bitcoin is continually divisible.

When there is only one satoshi not lost that will also be worth as much as all the preexisting satoshis. By then the code will be adjusted to make satoshis and their descendants divisible and so on and so on.

You make a good point about faith and participation.

I prefer the stock market. Some very low level of inflation of fiat is desirable because it boosts economic growth and avoids the risks of deflation. I think the Introduction of bitcoin ETFs might certainly boost demand. If we follow the example of gold which roughly quadrupled in value since ETF introduction in the early 2000s there is definitely a chance for bitcoin to be at 30K by 2030.

The shares in a company can go to zero if the company goes out of business. Is it not the case that bitcoin is different because even a small number of enthusiasts could and will keep it going indefinitely even if the BTC price drops to below the value where commercial mining is not profitable. Years could pass and then suddenly conditions could arise to make bitcoin rise up again. Is this correct, or would the increasing difficulty of mining new blocks mean that enthusiasts could not do this.

Your reasoning assumes that the demand thus the price are related only to the supply ie the 21 million. However the supply is not the only determinant of the demand. Thus if people completely lose interest in bitcoin for some reason then the demand may not be high at all. Some other crypto token might be the star, and bitcoin forgotten. Or fiat currency might retain its dominance, and crypto as a whole forgotten. We have to wait and see what happens.
@_date: 2018-03-10 09:56:23
OK thank-you, that makes sense. It was not completely clear to me from the news reports. It is understandable now that those people who suffered losses think they should get back more given that the price of BTC has appreciated so much. Suppose all the stolen coins had been recovered some time after MtGox had filed for bankruptcy. It would make sense that the stolen coins be returned to the owners not the money value at the time of the hack. In the current situation with not all coins recovered and suppose the price of BTC now were much less than at the time of the hack the people would be asking for the cash value at the time of the hack not the coins !
I suppose we are all now waiting now to see what the trustee does with the remaining coins. Give them to Mr Karpeles. Be kinder to those who suffered losses. Confiscate to the benefit of the Japanese government. Transfer to a trust fund for the benefit of some good cause. Or simply destroy the coins ie the relevant keys. I suppose it is not clear whether Japanese law can accomodate some nice solution.

I think gold has high demand and utility for jewellery. And this is in part because it looks beautiful and gives the wearer a good feeling, yes perhaps by tradition and custom also. I understand that having valuable investments could also make someone feel good but it is not quite the same use as metal gold jewellery.
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:41:05
That's interesting, thank-you.
Edit: Because I think of Japanese people as being very supportive of central authority (as I am) so I've been surprised at their apparent enthusiasm for bitcoin. But perhaps this does not at all entail an enthusiasm for any political project to replace fiat with bitcoin. Rather it is an enthusiasm to profit financially from a limited investment, which is fine of course.

I think we probably agree but are talking at cross purposes perhaps. In your original post you said that gold is stronger than steel. A sword made of steel is more effective as a weapon than a sword made of gold, because gold is more soft and malleable. Your Titanic and and Roman Empire example is relevant to reactivity. Gold has low reactivity which is why of course it does not rust and remains in good condition under adverse conditions for a very long time.

A new round of FOMO would be needed to bring in new elements of the “masses”. It would need to be a bigger FOMO then in December last year.

Retrospectively it will be possible to describe the transition process in terms of financial/social statistics. For example the % of merchants that accept bitcoin, the % whose salaries are paid in bitcoin plotted against time and so on. People are interested already in the companies that accept bitcoin and drawing up lists.
There is a strong political element. People need to agree to have their salaries paid in bitcoin. There is already polarization in views so a political struggle would be needed. In addition you will see that many supporters of the bitcoin project express strongly libertarian views, not all, but many.

Yes thank-you I understand the points you make. This is not activity characteristic of a normal investor who has second thoughts at the last moment.

There are substantial technological uses also but not matching jewellery demand. 
I take the point that bitcoin might be used relatively easily as money but we were talking about store of value.

I don’t follow all this as I am an ordinary investor not a trader. If I place an order to buy with the sincere intention to buy, then at the last moment, I waver, I decide against it, maybe it is not a good buy alter all, I will go for something else. That is not spoofing. I think that this is human nature to have such uncertainties and doubts. But if I place an order with the intention at the time of probably withdrawing the order later ie I have no desire to own the stock or asset then that would be spoofing.

It is not clear in what you have posted whether you envisage that the central bank would release its own Cryptocurrency which might well be tied to the fiat currency of the country OR whether you envisage the central currency using Bitcoin itself. This latter seems most unlikely for the Bank would need to buy Bitcoin and it is unlikely that politics would allow any government to do this. I understand your graph. It is unlikely that this gain for Bitcoin could be replicated again. As a store of value people prefer metal gold.

In the UK it is possible to propose petitions for a government response or discussion in parliament. What happens depends on how many votes a petition receives. The central authority will veto repetitive and similar petitions on the same topic.
What I am getting around to is, who will decide which proposals do people get to vote on in your system. There could be literally millions of topics put forward for voting. Who will decide which of these actually go forward for voting. There is the possibility also of slightly different proposals causing confusion.
Some countries do already make a lot of use of referenda eg Switzerland.
Edit: after voting who will execute the decisions in your system. For example suppose the majority of people vote for a high rate of taxation. How will this be enforced.

I think people generally are impressed negatively by the total cost of bitcoin, not necessarily the cost per transaction etc etc. They see the total cost seems big.

I suspect that in terms of absolute volume or amount, fiat is used much more for crime than bitcoin. It would be interesting to have the stats. I think the issue is whether bitcoin activity used for crime as a proportion of total bitcoin activity is greater than fiat activity used for crime as a proportion of total fiat activity. Again it would be interesting to know the stats. If bitcoin use for crime is proportionally greater then I suppose the question arises as to whether bitcoin is really needed. Bitcoin certainly needs to take some action to improve its CV.

Whether or not arguments about the costs of mining have some force, surely looking into the future there will always be Bitcoin enthusiasts to keep it going even if the price drops to near zero.

Gold has been regarded as a store of value for thousands of years. It is somewhat rare and also beautiful for jewellery and decoration, and has technological uses.
I took the demand in tons and price for metal gold from from World Gold Council website. For 2017 the demand in billions of US dollars are as approx follows.
Jewellery 87.5 
Technology uses 13.7
Investment 50.2
Banks and Institutions 15.2
The demand for use as Jewellery is impressive.
Crypto could fight to compete, but maybe it will take many many years 10s, 100s ... or never.
I am focusing on store of value and utility. Whether gold is useful as money is another issue, though there are some possibilities to spend online against a store of gold bullion.

It would be good to clarify precisely the title of your project. Because there are so many different cryptocurrencies it might be better to include a little intro on this but then focus, as you say, specifically on Bitcoin. As well as saying how it works it would be good I think, for a good grade, to present arguments for and against Bitcoin including information on Bitcoin as a money and as a store of value, compared with other types of money and assets eg dollars and gold.
Don’t know how much time you have but there are many many thought provoking posts and comments on the various pro and con Bitcoin subreddits.

I just thought, who would be in charge of the distribution and could we trust them to do this fairly.

I think we need to consider the time scale of adoption, metal gold thousands of years, bitcoin around 10 years. Certainly I don’t think we need to wait 1000 years before we could say “Gold is out Bitcoin is in” but really we need to wait around 100 years to say how things pan out with cryptos before casting metal gold aside. And certainly in 100 years it would be reasonable to say that there is still a huge metal gold demand for jewellery and perhaps still the technological uses.

Just because some pattern happened in the past is in itself no guarantee that it will happen again in the future.

But if wealthy hodlers buy luxury goods this means that they will have less bitcoin to hodl. Surely this is antithetical to their project to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible for when it goes to the moon, when they will have astronomical financial and political power. 
Anyway wealthy hodlers are probably so wealthy that the last thing they give time to thinking about is whether they will get a discount.

Governments could make the use of cryptos illegal if there were a substantial threat. Of course that won’t stop people using them just as speed limits on the highway don’t stop some people speeding. But the great majority of people respect the law and would be very discouraged from using bitcoin if to do so were made illegal. That would have severe impact on bitcoin use.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:20:56
I simply don’t agree with you on this. The government could simply pass legislation to make dealing in Bitcoin illegal. I control my own money it is in the bank and I use cash and a credit card, I am happy. To achieve your objective you need to convince the majority like me that we are wrong. Then I guess we would oppose the government legislation and it would not be passed. On your first point all I can do is repeat what I said before, you can’t stop people stealing, but the majority will try not to steal because it is against the law.

Gold has intrinsic value as jewellery.
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:47:03
Your paper is difficult obviously for most people without academic expertise in math and economics. I tried and scanned through. You have some equilibrium prices around 14k-15k range. My question. Suppose people lost interest in paying so much, eg did not value btc greater than say 1k insufficient to support costs of miners. What happens then. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:13:01
Not until you sell. But if you hold you are not using bitcoin to buy things. So you are hindering adoption by holding. Substantially increased adoption is needed for bitcoin to really take off.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:35:02
You need to arrange that peoples salaries, wages and pensions are paid in bitcoin not fiat. To do this you need to form or takeover a political party (in multiple countries?) that will take power and force that  bitcoin replace fiat.

It has its job cut out to compete with metal gold which has been recognised as a store of value for thousands of years. Annual demand in billions of USD around 88 for Jewellery, 14 for Technology uses, as well as investment and for banks institutions, figures from World Gold Council site. Metal gold is somewhat scarce, it is beautiful, how many people don’t have something made of gold. One advantage of Bitcoin perhaps is that large amounts of money can be transferred easily. However there are companies which will hold gold bullion for you and also allow you to spend it as money.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:46:54
Maybe the short answer is we don't know. I think people would still be very interested in gold jewellery as they were 1000 years ago when there were not banks and institutions as we know them now.
Gold is valuable because people have faith in its value going back a long time which is all mixed up with its use as bullion, jewellery, in industry and because it look beautiful and is somewhat scarce.
Ultimately it is developing a community and society of people who attach value to the commodity or asset.

I don’t think you’ll agree, but I think it is different from the early supporters of say Apple. Here we are talking about a new currency for the whole world largely owned by a new 1% who will become incredibly more wealthy than early shareholders of Apple or even Warren Buffet maybe. We don’t know who these people are and why should we trust them more than our Governments. People and Governments will never accept and allow bitcoin/cryptos to take over. Simply people will not adopt them enough or Governments will ban them.

You could take precautions in a will. However losses will still occur. As it is not reversible over the decades won’t there be steady rate of loss as you say. Bitcoin is divisible but appreciation of value would be needed. In the end it would all be lost. Perhaps economists have considered all this particularly in the context of competition between currencies.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:08:09
Yes correct, I don’t have to buy an Apple iphone there are many alternatives. But the Bitcoin vision is to drive out all competing currencies. Regarding the “fight” I think I’d rather be on the side of the US armed forces that a group of Bitcoin supporters. Happy ending for me too as I love using cash and credit card, cryptos seem so difficult to use and not secure.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:27:13
It’s more complicated than I thought. I think initially I had in mind the situation where the coins were premined. Then there could be a steady loss in the quantity of Bitcoin as measured by bitcoin not say Satoshi becasue of the divisibility. However I also overlooked that at any time, and assuming bitcoin indefinitely divisable, total loss could be averted by redistributing small amounts of of bitcoin to new addresses. Having multiple addresses prevents the total loss I had in mind.
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:39:52
Yes, the supply of gold can continue to increase to meet increased demand. However the supply of bitcoin can also increase through forks etc as we have seen.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:51:13
I take your point that many wealthy people are very careful with their money !

Could it be possible to print out the whole blockchain on paper,  make multiple copies and store them in different places in case computers and internet go down.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:19:15
What about sending tiny amounts eg 0.001BTC to randomly selected addresses until the 160K is exhausted instead of destroying it all.

I live in the UK. I don’t sympathise with what Andreas says. It doesn’t look likely we are going to agree on all this but thanks for the exchange. Goodbye.

This is fun. It is like thermodynamics.
The first law of Bitcoin: The amount of Bitcoin in the world always decreases with time, unless work is done.
The second law of Bitcoin: The work required to compensate for the loss of Bitcoin increases exponentially with time.
Work being that of the miners.

With regard to tax payments, Ohio will be holding world record for the shortest time between an entity receiving bitcoin in payment and then converting it into fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:27:49
Would not many bomb hoaxes actually increase the demand for bitcoin because it is needed to pay the demands. Thus BTC should go up.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:03:19
OK. Will you make a prediction for next Christmas ?
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:17:41
BTC is still $6,5K as that is the bottom. The exchanges might say $3.2K but that is just a dead cat dip.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:57:20
Good call but why were you so optimistic about the BTC price ?
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:57:33
I think one problem is that you would be broadcasting the intention of your participants. The professional traders might benefit from this, not sure how, but it is free information for them.
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:02:25
If it went up too much, many of the people who bought at 6-6.5K thinking it was the bottom, would try to get out which would cancel the intended effect.
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:32:04
Perhaps you need to consider also the literature on competition between currencies and that it might not actually be possible to isolate a closed bitcoin only ecosystem in practice. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:14:37
The bottom is $6.5K. What we see today is an illusion.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:31:12
Redpepperkun gets some kudos from last year, but you said $66K. To be fair though yours was one of the less crazy predictions at the high end. People should reflect deeply on what has happened in 2018. Do you all really believe that it all was FUD and manipulation that brought the price down from 20K to 4K ?
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:45:07
If the death spiral can work in the opposite direction to the spiral of despair, then bitcoin could surge to higher values. But if the two spirals reinforce, that is bad news for bitcoin indeed.
