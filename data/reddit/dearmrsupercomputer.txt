I figured someone somewhere was getting screwed, I just didn't know whether it was me, Starbucks, or someone else.

Fair enough, although I've only heard of Plan B in the U.S. and I've had to get the morning-after pill in both countries.
Brand names for drugs are used far less frequently in the UK.

Which is why people only call cannabis "weed" and nothing else...?

Ah that really sucks. I was going to purchase one just for the hell of it.
Isn't CT doing anything to stop this kind of thing?

All of these similar dreams can't just be a coincidence!

Having only lived in the UK and U.S., I have a limited personal perspective (as many of us do) and so I can't speak for Argentina, et al, where it may well have its uses.
However, what many Bitcoin enthusiasts talk about is Bitcoin's potential uses in the U.S. and other developed nations, and that's what I'd like us to discuss here.
I'd like to see widespread Bitcoin adoption in the developed world, but we are relatively spoilt when it comes to banking. We need to keep in mind that Bitcoin does have competition in this context, and the competition has money and government on its side.

I took 15 random words and created a long phrase from them with other words, used capitalization and punctuation, and memorized the whole thing. Then I tested that I could type the exact same string from memory multiple times over the last week or so. I hope that's enough.

Wow. I remember seeing this video three years ago. I tried to buy a ton of coins at a super low price not long after, but my bank blocked the transfer. So I gave up and left Bitcoin alone until recently...

They're stolen. No one is giving you free money.

So some kid asks what money is made of and this guy gives him a lecture on Bitcoin instead of answering his question?
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:04:47
Hey thanks for the response.


I completely agree with you, but I am speaking from a U.S./UK perspective. Many of us would like to see widespread Bitcoin adoption in our respective countries, and that is where Bitcoin will face growing competition from banks, which have money and government on their side.


Could you elaborate on this point?
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:53:16
Plan B is an American brand and he is British.
Do you know of Barclays, or do you have limited interaction with money?
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:54:55


Hey... I don't want to be that guy, but I'm in a very similar position as OP. Would you be able to tip me a very small amount of BTC so that I can test my secure storage while I wait for Bitstamp to receive my funds? I'll tip you 1000 DOGE :/

Oh my god I fucking love this news.

I wasn't attacking you personally and didn't mean any offense. I apologise.
I completely agree with you that it's really cool to be able to send money to anyone in the world knowing only a 32 character address.
However, as cool as that may be, I acknowledge that there are an increasing number of competing solutions in developed countries, and if want to see widespread BTC adoption we should accept this and work to make Bitcoin a viable option for the average user.

No. This is *your* ideology. 
It's people like you that make the Bitcoin community look like a bunch of libertarian freaks living in a fantasy world.

If SN is in fact Dorian, this would be a perfect way for him to finally get money from some of his unknown wallets. (Not that I think that's what's happening here). 
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:16:09
Exactly. Bitcoin is global. No one in the US is going to see "$" and think AUD.
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:58:27
Ah. I was just curious since the 500€ note above it also referred to money laundering. Thanks for the clarification.

Practically instant in the UK. Faster than a Bitcoin transfer anyway. How long does a domestic transfer take in the U.S.?
