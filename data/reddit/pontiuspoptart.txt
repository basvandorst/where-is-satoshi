ya but correcting people's grammar on the internet is usually done by people who need to feel some kind of win, even though they have added absolutely nothing to the conversation. I am tired of grammar correctors acting as if they have won an argument.

how can it be 100%  crypto when it is a centralized currency where as crypto is specifically a decentralized currency

I guess the issue I am wrestling with is so much finance would/could be moved out of the dollar, I don't see how the US won't be seeing this as a direct threat to their money supply.

I agree that there were substantial obstacles for the internet/tech companies. But the future opposition I see for crypto seems more formidable, Governments and Banks. 
The way I see it, the internet was an amorphous blob of information availability at the time, and the government really wasn't sure of what it could do, so there was and wasn't opposition. But with BTC, the opposition is very clear, a competing currency that seeks to undermine the US dollar and take away the reserve currency of the world. Now, that might not be specifically the goal of BTC, but that is how the US could perceive it. Libya was bombed to shit when they tried leaving the dollar, so although we probably won't get bombed to shit as BTC owners, I can foresee sever regulations coming down the pipeline to hamper our ability to continue owning and trading.

Ya IDK. I can see both possibilities. It was a question posed in the break room today and I found myself at a loss to answer it well. I hope you're right tho.
