Yes, correct on both points. Just to make sure, once you generate the addresses and private keys on the offline device you'll need to store them permanently somehow. Leaving them on the smartphone is an option, but you'll have to either encrypt them, or physically secure the device. Another option is to just write address and private key down on a piece of paper and secure that. 
BTW, a Linux LiveCD on an offline PC (your own PC with ethernet cable detached and wifi disabled) will work as well. And if you connect a dumb printer to it, you can also print out a paper wallet straight away.
I wish Armory authors would make an Android version of their wallet. Then you could make an offline wallet with offline transaction signing from any cheap Android smartphone with all wireless coms physically disabled.

Generating a password is not the goal, all you need to generate a private key is a 256-bit number, so you can just as well skip the word list part, and use d6 dice to generate the bits.
And on the topic of password generation. Big size of diceware dictionary results in it having some rather difficult to memorize words. I much prefer Poetry a.k.a. Electrum's mnemonic, which is an algorithm that encodes 32-bit chunks into 3-word phrases. It uses a list of ~1600 most common words in English literature (or maybe poetry specifically). That means you need 12 words to encode 128 bits compared to 10 diceware words, but I find Poetry phrases much easier to memorize.

Now that I've read deeper into the BIP38, I see more similarities between it and stealth addresses. But the latter gets rid of passphrases, intermediate codes, and the need to pass anything around.

2-of-3 escrow scheme, where escrow funds are locked in an address which can only be spent with at least 2 of 3 keys (buyer, seller and arbitrator having one each), does require a third party.

Someone must have been re-broadcasting your stuck transaction everyday, otherwise it should've been dropped after 24 hours. Any chance it's your wallet that's doing it? Maybe shutting it down for a few days will help.
Another option you may try is to manually push your stuck transaction into Eligius's memory pool, they accept all kind of unortodox tx, so maybe they'll mine yours as well: 
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:53:47
Just a nitpick. 3-4 chars are easy, an AMD 7970 video card can do 25Mkey per second, it can generate a 4 char address in half a second.
@_date: 2014-02-17 13:17:44
It's 15 minutes roundtrip for light to Mars and back. And as you  need the hash of the last block to mine a new one, the chances are very high that by the time you get that hash, find a new block and broadcast it back to Earth, there's already another block (or two) mined based on that hash.
That's for solo mining. It's even worse for mining in a pool, as the block you are working on is changing frequently as new transactions are added to it. So if you are working on an old/stale version of a block, all your shares will be rejected by a pool.
Transactions would work fine, just slower.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:28:35
That's not how transaction malleability works. It just allows to change the transaction id, but not its content, like sender, recipient or amount transferred. This only allows the malefactor to later claim that transaction never happened and request a (probably automatic) re-send.
It would require astounding incompetence on mtgox's side to lose 700k bitcoins in this manner.

The problem is, the size of your transaction is 36037 bytes, and the recommended transaction fee is .1 mBTC per 1000 bytes, so the recommended fee for your transaction is actually 3.7 mBTC. So, either miners don't want to pick up such a big transaction without appropriate fee, or your transaction is not even propagated to them. In the latter case you can try to submit your transaction to a miner pool manually. E.g. [to eligius](
Edit: you can get raw transaction representation via Bitcoin-QT's console command [getrawtransaction](

Why not just use an encrypted BIP38 address? It's basically a 2-factor wallet, a thing you have -- an encrypted address, and a thing you know -- passphrase.

The encrypted wallet.dat can be stored publicly in however many places you like, give a copy to each of your family members, print it out, carve it in stone, [CNC machine it into a piece of steel]( The later works better with deterministic wallets like those in Electrum and Armory, as there's just one key to encrypt, not 100+, like in satoshi client's wallet.dat.

From the article:




So, it's basically like keeping your funds at a bitcoin exchange. But while other exchanges are keeping their reserves in cash/bank deposits, bitreserve is going to invest those reserves into different low-risk assets, which are going to yield them a small profit.

First, this encrypted private key is spendable by both, payer and payee. Stealth address allows the payer to send funds to an address that only payee can spend.
Second, this requires interaction between payer and payee by some secure channel (to transmit the "intermediate code"). Stealth address is, to simplify it somewhat, embeds the intermediate code into the transaction itself, in an encrypted form that only the payee can decode, so payee doesn't have to send a newly generated password to each and every payer.
And I'm pretty sure there are other important differences, which I'm missing.

The term for that general scenario is Market failure. To quote wikipedia, "scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view."

Where can I read BU's official position on SegWit and on their proposed malleability fix?
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:12:48
Nope, it's not. The essence of TotC is about lack of ownership of the common resource which leads to overconsumption by self-interested parties. How is that relevant to bitcoin?
Edit: I think I need to expand on that a bit. Lack of ownership means that self-interested parties gain what there's to gain from using the resource, but they bear no cost. That's what leads to depletion of common resource. If it's not you gaining profit from that resource, others will because it's free.
That's not what we are seeing with bitcoin right now. It might be about miners seeing SegWit and Lightning protocol that it enables as a net loss for them, or it might be something more nefarious, but it's not about overconsumption of a free resource.
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:10:19


I don't get this math. 
"100k of blocks?" As in, almost two years' worth of blocks? 40k USD is about the price of filling 1 MB with "spam" for a whole day. (60satoshis/byte×1MB/block×144blocks/day=86.4BTC/day×415USD/BTC= ~36k USD/day)
But then, why would filling 2MB block would cost ten times that instead of two times?
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:37:44
The point of TotC is that when you have a free shared resource it will be overconsumed. Because users don't bear cost of using the resource, but they do gain the profits. It's rational to overconsume such a resource to a point of total depletion. (It's also rational to allow ownership of such a common resource so that there IS a party that bears cost of consumption of it.)
But it's not what is happening with bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:04:19
That's missing the point of Tragedy of the Commons.

DO are rolling out block storage service this summer, it probably won't cost more than 1$/10GB×month (vultr's prices for block storage). Scaleway's prices are even less at 1€/50GB×month.
That is to say, that more and more budget VPS providers will offer block storage as a separate option, so you won't need to upgrade the whole server.

Incorrect on every point.
You put funds into your lightning wallet by opening payment channels with a couple lightning nodes. You can close those channels and get your bitcoins at any time without anyone's consent.
You can send funds to anyone on the lightning network, not just the nodes you've opened channels to. No, they don't have to have as much as you in their wallet. But yes, the receiver (their lightning wallet software, technically) must be online to negotiate the fund transfer with you.

Judging by the images of "multisig" wallet you attached, it's actually Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme, not multisig. The address starts with 1, not 3... and it doesn't make sense to create all three signatures of a multisig address in one place, kinda defeats the purpose.

Just to make it clear, webmoney is a multi-currency payment system, it has different purses for different currencies, and it has a central exchange for all webmoney currencies (wm.exchanger.ru). 
So, you open a webmoney account, create a WMX-purse, top it up with bitcoins (at wmx.webmoney.ru), and then either exchange WMX for WMZ/WME/WMR (USD/EUR/RUB) and pay in a store, or, during checkout via webmoney's merchant system you'll be prompted to automatically exchange whatever webmoney currency you have into whatever currency that store accepts.

It's not like you can mine with bare chips. To burn-in those chips, they'll have to manufacture Avalon miner units/boards. And then go through all the trouble of dismounting 100s of thousands of chips from those boards, which will leave marks on them. This just doesn't make sense.

It's actually a nice idea. Just pair your seed phrase with some big number (of iterations) and suddenly brute force software has that much more iterations to do to check a single phrase. 
Considering vanitygen can iterate through 20Mkeys in a second with an AMD GPU (or up to 750Kkeys/s with a quad-core), you should pick the number of iterations accordingly--at least 10s of millions, or maybe in billions, if you don't mind waiting.
