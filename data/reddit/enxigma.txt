This was done so well, damn
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:32:07
Thanks for the explanation 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:31:01
Andreas deserves every penny of those donations for what he’s done for the Bitcoin and cryptocurrecy community.

As a HODLER I agree, it can drop to a thousand for all I care. For me it’s the price at the end of 2018 that I care about nothing before.

I thought Yahoo was dead after there email service gets hacked repeatedly. It shouldn’t be too long I presume before coinmatketcap takes over.

I have a Ledger Nano S, am I also not affected? I know the Ledger is not vulnerable to malware but the meltdown doesnt seem to be malware but more of an exploit?

Did he buy it with a credit card? Or a debit card, their are many banks not allowing credit card purchases for crypto but allow debit cards

Well do you know when the lightning network is going to be implemented? 
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:30:37
This is honestly what scares me most about using exchanges, if it’s not exchanges getting hacked, it’s exchanges randomly locking people out of their accounts.

In personally would sell to cover my initial investment (plus some small costs) and leave the rest for mars. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:20:21
The Bitcoin Cash sub is actually a joke, they recently stress tested their network and then they spread news about how many transactions people are making. Frankly it’s quite sad. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:03:05
Does this include the transactions from trading websites? If it doesn’t it would be even more cool 
@_date: 2019-11-18 07:10:10
That’s pretty cool but what makes this better than well established brands like Trezor or Ledger?
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:59:57
I read the article but how does this differ from any other bank that accepts crypto? 
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:13:52
So he’s basically the CEO of Bitcoin Cash, I thought it was supposed to be decentralised?
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:06:05
Where did he mention Bitcoin though 
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:10:52
Don’t get me wrong I hold BTC I believe it can revolutionise the finance industry but these ridiculous comparisons need to stop. Also what if In 10 years you lose the seed for your wallet, with a bank you can just show ID to get your account back however with crypto you lost every penny.  What about if I bought a £2000 computer with crypto and the seller didn’t ship the item when he said he did, with crypto I lose every penny while with a bank account there are chargebacks and protections. What if I want to send money to a family and I enter the wrong address, with crypto I lose every penny I sent while with a bank within minutes I can cancel the transaction. 
Again I hold BTC and I’m in it for the long run but stop with these ridiculous comparisons 
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:12:53
Don’t get me wrong I hold bitcoin but we can’t forget about Bitcoin going from 20K to 3.5K in a year. There are many businesses that took BTC only for them to lose money compared to if they just took regular fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:25:51
I’m a bit confused, so its based on Ethereum but they have Bitcoin on there name? Like how is that allowed 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:37:02
I didn’t want to buy at $8100 now it’s at $8917 ��
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:00:31
What was kept secret from you 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:03:46
They’ll come back to Bitcoin, it’s only a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:13:00
That’s actually so cool 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:34:30
I also think it’s the way people phrase Bitcoin. For instance saying your going to buy Bitcoin kind of infers your buying the whole coin whereas you can say your going to buy £500 worth of Bitcoin infers the fraction. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:31:23
Correct me if I’m wrong but the market cap for Bitcoin can only change if the price of the coin changes? Or is it the price and the amount that has been mined? Or neither?

I live in the London, this is probably the first time I’m seeing a public toilet you have to pay for.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:19:36
So is that actually Satoshi?
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:35:55
As much as I like Bitcoin, how exactly am I going to pay if I’m not using my phone or a card? 
I don’t see myself carrying a contact less hardware wallet with me anything soon
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:06:57
That’s pretty cool but what is meant by 4000 out of 25000? Is that the number of newsstand or what?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:09:20
I see the potential in bitcoin but I also see why myself and friends don’t spend bitcoin. Our main reason is that it’s better to buy items with FIAT since the price is stable than with Bitcoin which still has a relatively volatile price. For instance something that costs £10 would be £10 in BTC one day but the next it could be the equivalent of £11.50 just because of the market crashing. This can add up and end up costing more for myself and other people just for adopting Bitcoin. This can be applied to any crypto currency in general.

Because the fares are pretty high at least in the U.K. Aside from the initial cost of the ATM each transaction is very profitable for the business 
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:37:59
Does this include trading between bots in exchanges? 
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:52:16
This was better than I expected, good points from both sides
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:53:56
Once the transaction times go down and fees lower I can’t see anything stopping Bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:11:55
This persons first mistake is investing more that they can afford to lose, who in their right mind thinks investing their rent money is a good idea, at that point your gambling.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:21:46
How would refunds work? Like what if the seller just doesn’t issue a refund?
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:42:37
This might be a stupid question but what does the user gain from running a Bitcoin Node, I’m still fairly new to everything other than trading the coin?
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:14:49
Probably a scam
