And yet bitcoin has the potential to be a lot more convenient than any kiosk, *without* blatantly ripping people off.  Way to completely miss the point of the OP
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:41:15
That's fucked up.

I'm agreeing with you that kiosks are a legal way to make money, governed by supply and demand, market forces, etc
But it's not an honest way.
And it's not even that bitcoin is more honest than kiosks -- bitcoin is honesty-agnostic; and so of course the more honest trade is going to take place in bitcoin rather than kiosks, because there's no hidden charges no bullshit fees required, *unless a-priori agreed upon by seller and buyer*.  And that's the message that you are ignoring.
Bitcoin is infinitely more convenient than any so-called "convenience charge."

Way to miss the point bro.

Cool smear attempt
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:03:27
You can do so all you want, but I will never defend predatory business practices (such as selling water for $10 a bottle during east coast blackout a couple of years ago compared to which this kiosk nonsense is only a shade less despicable)

Any explanation at all what is high risk about the attempted transaction?

This is why you use escrow.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;Can you explain in layman terms why mining companies are necessary at all?
Can bitcoin exist without mining companies?  Something tells me it has, in the past, but my memory may be hazy here...&lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Guys you all have computers.  Mine using that and stop feeding the mining trolls.  No, you aren't going to mine any actual bitcoin anymore, yes, you are going to sustain the bitcoin network.  Done and done.

You can't stop bitcoin

Thinking about bitcoin (new eco tech) in terms of securities (old eco tech) and trying to pigeon hole new tech into the corrupt structure of the old tech is probably a mistake.

It's important to know who Satoshi was not *because...*
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:34:21
How can someone do a lot of harm by claiming to be Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:39:12
Still not getting it.  I mean, sure, you can defraud someone gullible enough to go into "business" with "Satoshi"
But thats not a principle of fraud.  That's a principle of gullibility, independent of Satoshi, bitcoin, or even finance.  (Applies to religion, etc)
So I'm still at a loss, after studying that thread, why it is important to know who Satoshi was, or how someone can defraud individuals by having them go into "business" (whatever that means) by pretending to be Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:04:25
Why is it important to know who Satoshi was?
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:10:44
I still don't understand how that would cause a panic and selloff.
If the first blocks of the blockchain start moving, that just means that maybe some of Satoshi's coins are being moved to another one of his wallets...
But I get it, witch hunts don't really require logic
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:33:15
Really?  How would such a disruption happen?  I thought it was network node control that could allow a disruption, I didn't realise btc holdings could allow it... any links?
(Also, the one million btc or whatever, what percentage is that of total btc under everyones control?)
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:53:02
I agree, except I don't see how this is a chiefly bitcoin/Satoshi thing...
I guess there aren't that many "potentially influential" anonymous persons out there, and so I can't take seriously that someone would fall for being manipulated by someone pretending to be an anonymous person...
@_date: 2017-07-06 10:08:22
How would anyone know that Satoshi (lets assume his irl identity is known) sold any significant portion of his holdings?

The question is: how to decide, in the year of Commodore, Atari, Nokia, Ericsson, CP/M, Wordperfect, Lotus Notes or Netscape, to correctly pick Microsoft, Apple, or IBM (or AWS)
