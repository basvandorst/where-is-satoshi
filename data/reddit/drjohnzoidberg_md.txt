No no, it's totally not the VC firms running up prices so they can make a ton of money off unsophisticated speculative investors in this unregulated space.

Stock markets are much easier to access for the average person than Bitcoin. 
You are correct about the small user base but should look into the concentration of wealth. That's the biggest driver of the volatility.

The price would substantually increase because the vast majority of Bitcoin wealth is concentrated to just a few people. If $10 was purchased no matter the price, supply would become so thin Bitcoins would be priced very high. This is basically what happened the other day as a large supply came into the market driving prices down until demand skyrocketed and supply dried up.
