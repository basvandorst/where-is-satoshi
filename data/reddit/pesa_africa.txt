why not?
If the globe is becoming more connected, and global commerce, and young africans emerging who are more connected to the globe than ever, and the number of smartphones shipping to AFrica is going up exponentially (number of dumb phones shipped to AFrica is on the decline). . .  then why not?
Look at the patterns. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:31:36
Mpesa only works locally. Within Kenyan bounderies. What is a young African wants to send money to an online merchant? 
That is where Bitcoin comes in. Bitcoin bridges the payment gap to the rest of the globe for global commerce.
Also, mobile money is highly centralized, and censorship has happened in the past on Mpesa and Mpesa like digital currency systems.

"These events are relevant to bitcoin, as the regulator of one of East Africa’s largest economy, made a public notice last year urging citizens to refrain from bitcoin and virtual currencies. However, through the eyes of the law, bitcoin is undefined. Since then, volumes on peer to peer market localbitcoins, have made consistent highs on weekly volumes, upto $50,000 a week as per coindance."

@_date: 2016-04-23 14:30:52
thats one way to look at it.
The other way is exchanges as remittances channels. I could use BitPesa.co or umati.io on the front end to buy bitcoins via KES fiat in Kenya to send value to China, but they are paid out in Yuan by BTCC in China. It is not competing,it is a strategic partnership. Could be remittances, could be B2B payments.

me too. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 12:34:58
but arent they dealing with different clients, from different markets using different currencies on the front end?
Bitcoin allows a local business to offer a local brand for value transfer. They could all share a back end, but, at days end, someone's going to have to do the marketing in eg Kenya, rather X country.
Bitcoin becomes like a white label (open permission less) value transfer back end system. The start up in your local country has an equal footing competing with a global bitcoin exchange (in your market).

about sending,you could print out many paper wallets with small amounts of bitcoin that you could give out and ask them to scan to receive. After they have wallets of course -mycellium. To add flavour, you can then ask them to share some of what they have now on their wallets, with the person next to them. Then, since you know the addresses of your paper wallets, you can view the blockchain for emphasizing key points about the Bitcoin and bitcoin All this for interaction which is great for making presentations fun.

In descending order (biggest to smallest)
what goes on in the rest of the free world. When i speak to people, they almost always bring up 'ponzi', 'Gox' 'scam'. Thing is, they have access to the internet and come across all these stories. Really hard to convince them when you are up against 10 pages on google on the above. So, what happens in the US, UK, Europe affects perception here. In this regard, I'm optimistic because i see a lot of good coming out of these regions.
 Legitimacy - been trying to convince online freelancers here to ask their employers to pay them in BTC to save up on high costs eg paypal (as much as 16%!!). It would help if BTC got a stamp of approval and maybe appeared on payment processors as a payment option? They could easily convert to KES via services here eg Bitpesa, BitX
volatility - always comes up (my guess is from all the brainwash mainstream media ie CNN, BBC keep regurgitating
uncertain regulation. its still unclear where bitcoin falls in the eyes of the law.
awareness - this is on the up as more people get to hear about it. maybe not dive right into it, but, its good when they read/hear about it. Its a start.
I am optimistic numbers will go up. As long as the ecosystem globally continues marching forward. In fact, Kenya will likely lead adoption in Sub Saharan Africa. It is super easy to buy and sell bitcoins (less than an hour). No bank a/c required, a mobile money wallet is enough. Watch this space!

i think you need to watch the video. He is not against bitcoin. he talks of a time past bitcoin (the future) and how in fact, the way in which value was exchanged in the past (history) holds key insight to how money might evolve in future. Say starbucks coin, dogecoin, 'Kanye'coin but on a global scale. So money based within communities and 'trust' systems. But then, people might want to trade outside these communities. Say buy donuts. One will have to trade from Starbucks coin to Dunkin Donuts coin. 
My guess: This connection between different communities (trustless) may be the blockchain or Bitcoin. He doesn't say this in the video. 
I recommend you watch this video.

yes. For now. That's why i said this "regulation is key to making this possible."
If there was a gateway in my country, I wouldn't need SWIFt. I could use my mobile wallet via a gateway provider.
Methods of adding funds will depend on region and regulatory constraints. Right now, regulation restricts CICO options. This can and will change. If a gateway adheres to KYC, KYCC, AML &amp; CFT regulations, what's the point in going through a bank? A gateway can offer a cash in option on its own.

It's not black and white. here, the mobile money scene is complex - competition, regulation, monopolies, banks becoming MNOs +++ more.
I don't doubt the tech could work. Question is, would it get adopted? Go mainstream? MPESA is a huge brand backed by milllions of dollars in ad and marketing. It already offers a low cost way to send money within the Kenyan borders.
i'm not sure you understand the complexity of the mobile money ecosystem in Kenya. 
Bitcoin can offer solutions. I'm fully aware - i could list them here, however. Its use will be restricted to use cases (in Kenya atleast) - ecommerce, international wire payments, remittances, donations. As a currency? Not so sure.
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:31:00
Well, now there is. In Kenya! BitPesa! With bitPesa, a migrant worker can send money via bitcoins to a beneficiary in rural kenya. The BitPesa does the BTC - fiat exchange and sends the money DIRECTLY to the beneficiary's mobile wallet in Kenya - MPESA, airtel money, Orange money.
This invalidates your point and proves it's possible to send money from abroad to a person in the rural areas of East Africa. Now, it's just a matter of extending this model to other similar countries. It helps to have an MNO mobile money service in the recepient's country

"I think the biggest advantage of bitcoin over M-Pesa for many people of African countries, is that bitcoin is not pegged to a national currency."
Wrong! At least in Kenya (home to Mpesa) that is not the case. People here would rather know that the amount they put in their mobile wallet, is what they'll get when they make a withdrawal X days later. In fact, it's the exact opposite! bitcoin's volatility is a challenge in East Africa. The Kenya Shilling is not nearly as volatile as bitcoin.
On another note, FYI, Zimbabwe is on the frontier of digital currency in Africa. They have Ecocash and lots of other mobile wallet services offered by Banks and Telcos. Regulation in Zim is pushing for cashless, or at least cash-lite economy. This is a fact that often isn't mentioned.

Yes! I agree, i certainly did. Sold bitcoins via PayPal on Local bitcoins. Scammer deviously reversed payment immediately. I had to piece up my case based on records i had from Localbitcoins and dispute.
Eventually, i followed dispute procedure and followed up with a phonecall (s). The phone calls seemed to help speed my dispute resolution but boy did it cost me! I'm non-US based, so calls are really expensive. Still, I managed to resolve it and get back my funds. I'm still uneasy until i get cash on hand from withdrawal.
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Although, I found out payments as gifts have no buyer protection and thus non-disputable. This is the only condition i would accept for selling bitcoins via PayPal.
Be warned, be carefuL!

Look, i find misinformation about Africa in general incredibly annoying. Especially when they're made by outsiders. i try do my bit to at least occasionally inform. Nothing cunty about that. If you intend on speaking on the preferences of the African people in general, then you ought to have some facts right - not just presumptions.
Here's the assumption you've been insisting on - "The advantage to bitcoin (via SMS gateways) over random african currency (via SMS gateways) is the political invulnerability of bitcoin and it's inherent inter-nationality"
In my experience, people here would rather use a money transfer service that gives you 100% emoney for fiat with 0 volatility. What that means is that bitcoin doesn't cut it for now, because of its volatility. With a government issued currency, people know what they're getting and don't have to visit a chart site (online) to check if their funds have lost value. 
My point is bitcoin is not an advantage over pegged national currencies because of it's volatility! No matter what you believe, you are out of touch with reality in Africa.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:24:18

If done properly, donations is one example. NGOs could bypass the traditional financial system and just accept BTC. Receive BTC in 30 mins, take BTC to BitX, 1.5% and zap! You have more cash than you would have with a traditional financial route.
It's also good for the ecosystem. Maybe more people will start conjuring up solutions now that BTC-fiat and fiat-BTC is an option.

You're right. I'm aware of this tech. It's part of what needs to change/happen if bitcoin is to succeed. Services and infrastructure shielding the intricacies of the blockchain under a mask UI.
Have you seen the MPESA UI? Its an SIM application that runs on your phone and wholly dependent on the SIM. The SIM is proprietary - owned by the MNO. They restrict access to all.
Recently, overlay skin SIM technology is emerging in Kenya to circumvent this lock out by MNOs.

because communities are natural and appeal to individuals based on their attributes. The present form of money is not a natural law. Therefore, it makes sense for community based currencies to emerge.
Think of someone who likes coffee and hang out at coffee shops.

Her currency will be based on the gaming community where they draw benefits they prefer within this community.

 The key point is using intermediaries or a third party. "Since P2P banking does not use third party banking institution intermediaries the rates and terms are often much more favourable for the members." eg Kiva
The term P2P has been blurred. Strictly, it should mean without going through a 3rd party. Say, like BitTorrent. Maybe, incumbent Banks &amp; FIs have applied the term for their own gains.
 "A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of decentralized and distributed network architecture in which individual nodes in the network (called "peers") act as both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to centralized client–server model where client nodes request access to resources provided by central servers."

Yes! Absolutely! Bitcoin can change international wire transfers especially in most African countries. For example, in East AFrica, Kenya Uganda and Tanzania use a local RTGS. The trouble is, this system is isolated from the global payments network. Receiving funds from abroad (Europe, North America, Australia etc) requires SWIFT and a series of correspondent banks. It takes days to wire money and on top of that, fees.
How important is this? VERY! The top export for Kenya for example are tea, remittances, coffee, horticulture and vegetables. Billions of USD dollars in foreign exchange, millions of people and farmers directly earning income from these industries and millions more indirectly. Remittances come from all over the world on a country by country basis.
A Bitcoin/blockchain based global payment service could lower fees significantly, drastically cut down the time it takes and cut out intermediaries that add to overheads.
Believe it, Africa REALLY needs a more inclusive global payments network
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:02:03

No. Not necessarily. MPESA is centrally issued by a Mobile Network Operator. It works on the cellullar network via USSD and a SiM toolkit application. Works across any phone (feature and smartphone).
Bitcoin on the other hand, requires an internet connection to enable Peer-Peer. Plus its decentralized.  
Maybe this will help 
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:40:07
Not exactly.
Transactions fees are fair for amounts &gt; $20. Transfer fees for amounts over $20 is 1% or less.
High transaction fees are incurred for amounts &lt; $20 and micropayments. For this category, fees is as high as 90%!
See these two charts from Tanzania and Uganda which both Mpesa and similar platforms

I am also in touch with others trying to see how we can channel bitcoin donations to them. It is not a one man job.
The problem is not just about donating, it is more about a concerted effort, setting up a structure and a face to marshal the community.

Maybe not tomorrow, at some point in future perhaps.
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:16:03
I agree. However, regulation is changing. Like the recent skin SIM technology proposed by a bank for its MVNO services. Essentially, the stranglehold Safaricom has on their proprietary SIM and toolkit will cease. This opens doors to multiple players to compete without the worry of a non-accessible SIM (which is one way Safaricom has dominated the market). Still, it's going to be an upheaval. Like you said, 'civic pride'. 
My young friends and smartphone adopters frequently whine about Safaricoms sleazy tactics and high prices. That could be an entry point. We'll see.

B2B can easliy be implemented using the concept of private money.

@_date: 2014-08-14 12:23:00
Now, yes. But that could change. Bitcoin didn't get up one morning and rise to a market cap of $ 8 billion. . . it took a while, a period of growth and acceptance. Don't discount it based on the number NOW. It certainly has potential in some niche markets like international B2B payments
@_date: 2014-08-14 12:56:15
Well in that case, Ripple is ok. Transfer of value is ok for commerce. What is money anyway? Money is value. What changes is the representation of value. Could be a paper, bar of gold, salt, cowrie shells or even IOUs. So, arguably, by extension, Ripple is a means to transfer money. : p

Richard was partially right. but in some regards, he missed some areas where Bitcoin can remedy an antiquated international payment systems.
Here is a link to 'How Bitcoin &amp; Digital Currency can enable millions of farmers in Africa &amp; East Africa' 
Basically, billions of dollars coming into  Kenya rely on a long chain of correspondent bank networks that skim fees, fx margins and significant delays.
Imagine 2 African countries trading with each other have to rely on correspondent banks in the US and Europe to do a simple exchange of value.
I recommend you all read the article linked
@_date: 2014-08-17 19:33:45
But, like someone said, cooperation of the carrier wil be necessary. Carriers in some countries (not sure about all) have proprietary control over the SIM. There is no precedent worldwide for establishing equal access rules to SIM cards, as unbundling the SIM card might have severe implications for the security of mobile networks.
One solution could be SIM overlay technology 
This opens up lots of doors
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:19:29
That is exactly the point. Why hasn't any responsible bitcoin figure with enough clout to marshal the community taken a public stand and intervened? Say, suggest to these organisations the possibility of quickly setting up transparent structures to channel donations via bitcoin? That is what really bothers more. It can't be that difficult to set up a public wallet address (that sorts the transparency problem)
@_date: 2014-08-14 13:19:07
There you go again. You have it mixed up. Once you sign up with a Ripple gateway (which could be anyone), you effectively bypass SWIFT and SEPA. That's exactly the point. You don't require SWIFT or SEPA anymore!
Of course, regulation is key to making this possible.

100 m from where I live is a physical store labelled Mpesa agent. I go here with cash in hand and in exchange, the kind lady tops up my cellphone with an equivalent amount of digital currency. 1 for 1. 1000 KES cash for 1000 KES units on my phone.
Later during the day, i see the price of bitcoin capitulate to $ 165 and i think to myself, holy f*ck! BUY!
I visit Bitpes.co/buy and make an order for 1000 KES worth of bitcoins. I get an email reply with a quote. I then send my 1000 units on my phone to Bitpesa, right there on my phone. I get a blockchain notification informing me of a bitcoin deposit in my blockchain wallet.
12 hours later, the market is back up at $ 230.  30%!!! Sell!
I login into Bitpesa.co, and exchange my bitcoins for KES. They are happy to do it for a 3% spread. In fact, they're so good, they'll send you all your money in digital currency, MPESA! Right back into your phone! Cool right?
I step outside for a cig and pass by the mpesa agent to convert some of my mpesa digital currency into cash. Because my local kiosk does not accept mpesa for cigs, i need some loose change!

//is the internet ubiquitous enough to support a bitcoin economy?
its healthy. There is potential -- low cost android smartphones, a large population of tech savvy millenials, fibre roll outs, 4G networks. Some of still concentrated in urban areas. 
//I think Africa is just screaming for bitcoin - from the hyper-inflation that lead to me owning a $100T dollar Zimbabwe bill to the lawless, uncontrolled areas, there is certainly a need for low fee internet money that works everywhere.

i wasn't explaining how BitPesa works. I was responding to "who is buying bitcoin for their KES right now?"
Regarding how they work, I would guess they use some form of hedging and hold as little BTC as possible. Probably offload BTC as soon as they're received from a client. Or, reflect prices on their website similar to the order book at an exchange of their choice, then they can immediately offload as per what was displayed to the client. Remember, the client takes some risk as well. The risk that BTC will fluctuate. Basically, a way to cut out the wild volatility of BTC from their operations. Say like BitPay. 
Can't say for sure though

bitcoin doesnt have to be called a 'currency' by mainstream sensationalist folk for it to have value. It could be valuable as a scarce digital asset (that is cool enough to use as money).
Therefore, they can call it what they want. We shouldn't get hang up on labelling it a currency. Let us call it something 'new'.
So really, the argument by some mainstream critics about bitcoin not a great long term bet because it can't be a currency because its too volatile , is a skewed look at bitcoin and why it could be valuable in future.
David Birch is guilty of this.

Banks, MFIs, SACCOs, NBFIs already have agent networks, what they lack is open access for all technology to enable them to issue digital currencies.
The time for digital currencies in Kenya is now!

who cares. . .
there wont be another censorship resistance proof asset class like Bitcoin. If thats the only value proposition of Bitcoin then i will take.
I hate these folks who do not consider Bitcoin's use case (as an asset class) as a valid use case. You can tell by how they dismiss some of us as 'speculators'.
I used to be a derivatives analyst. a profession. Much of the world's commodities that people use in their daily lives are traded by speculators and traders. How then can they dismiss this as a use case??

Interesting. How do we suggest we do this? If there was a way, it would have been done. Or atleast, this event might spur some innovation on that front.
Remember also, that the miners too are improving on their processes, like with asic boost. (others may disagree)
But point is, we are stuck with them until *magic happens*
For now, i am sorry to break it to you, we have to stick with asic POW.
Else, something else (which won't be bitcoin if it is not POW enabled).
Adam Back admitted this on a podcast with Chris De rose.
POW is a BIG deal!
And miners know how important it is too
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:05:57
because it is like shooting yourself in the foot. Sure, they could try regulate it, but it becomes an infiltration, and bitcoin gets closer to winning in the end.

why has it not happened yet? When the current model as evidenced by Wang has led to miners holding Bitcoin hostage.
Maybe it exists, but this is what we have to contend with now. Which was my point all along.
People whining about a miner leveraging his mining power. Well, that is the design! A miner is economically incentivized to invest in mining equipment and mine!
Until the market figures out another way around Wang
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:26:31
well, then go build a mining farm or pool or mining operation.
Fact is, POW rules! And why he can talk like this.
Technical arguments aside
@_date: 2017-04-13 07:41:02
bitcoiners learning hard lessons in the 'free market'
Pretty much like to bandy 'free market' around whenever it suits them.
But when, a private owner of an economically incentivized mining operation (POW) takes an opinion of his own (for whatever reason), we turn to this.

@_date: 2017-04-13 08:56:23
yes, they can.
I am aware.
But till today, there is no better algorithm than POW to support an immutable decentralized network like the Bitcoin blockchain.
It is the reason we are in a debate today. Because POW is largely enabled by hashing power thus miners, thus Wang Chun and Jihan
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:58:06

bit unfair to call people ignorant mob.
Not every one who owns or uses bitcoin is a C++ core developer
Meaning bitcoin's success is not only attributable to code or writers of code. Some non- programmers have played a BIG role in bringing on board new users into Bitcoin and growing Bitcoin awareness.
While i am not a developer, and cannot write code, i take offense at calling us (or any bitcoin believer) an ignorant mob. 
PS: I am neutral to this HF Segwit drama
But Bitcoin has a problem of high IQ people talking down on the rest of us who cannot write code
and why , IMO, no matter how great any technology is, it always boils down to the people!
Call them ignorant, or whatever, but their impact on BTC adoption and growth is real and undeniable.

They do not get it. The real value proposition of bitcoin is a censorship proof asset - digital gold. This should be the basic fundamental layer. doesn't really have to handle transactions comparable to Paypal of Visa or whatever.
Once this layer is in place, secure and decentralized, offchain payment channels can be built on top of it/ connected to it that can do way more transactions than these card networks. Plus,with all the cool features of bitcoin payments on smartphones. Cards? Why would you want to compete with cards?Card companies will come to Bitcoin's offchain payment channels to built off it.
Plus Plus, these payment channels will have the security of the Bitcoin blockchain eg for final settlement.
Anyone who doesn't see this is short sighted and not worth arguing with.

Mass adoption! So that i just pay you or anyone else in bitcoin, you can accept it and use it elsewhere.
The other alternative is to grow a peer ro peer agent network so that people exchange bitcoins for cash at multiple points. Right now, mpesa uses an agent model (to-down). Peer to peer agent models are difficult to scale artificially because they're dependent on natural adoption VS mpesa agent model that is centralized, has a budget and a company that oversees its roll out etc etc

if you have a look at their team, they have several ex-bankers. You should talk to a banker. It is really about managing risk - multiple currencies , one of which is highly volatile.
I imagine it also helps to have investors with a large pool of bitcoins to get started.
Also helps to have connections. Say you have a US bank that lets you bank with them and cross settle at years end. So, all you would need is  enough KES to cover BTC sales for a year (or half a year (or quarterly))).

what is your 'normal high risk allotment' now? if i may ask
@_date: 2016-05-05 09:25:45
the truth.


misunderstand the lesson that Satoshi originally taught - trust in 
mathematics to prove accountancy. Yes, cryptography can prove that a 
coin is available and disposable pending an attempt to further dispose 
it. But the Bitcoin design was deliberately weak when it came to proof 
of persons. Especially, when it comes to known and now revealed 
weaknesses in the persona once known as Satoshi Nakamoto, there is no 
proof in mathematics that can satisfy that community's yearning for yet 
another meal."


controlled by a trust. Any movement of those coins needs to operate 
according to trust rules; if not, then we are in a state of sin. What 
that means is not something that can be described in mathematical terms, 
but it can certainly be described in hysterical terms - the logic de 
jure of the Bitcoin community.  As an aside, I really strongly suggest 
that the Bitcoin community not press for the breaking of the trust.  If 
unsure on this point, ask your miners to explain that old curse "be 
careful what you wish for."  Breaking the trust is way off the scale of 
what anyone will desire.

From where I'm standing, the '1st world' need bitcoin because your governments and central banks are about to bring down the global financial system. Negative interest rates, cashless agenda - who needs it more? Take a look in the mirror @_date: 2015-10-27 09:35:33

cashflow. It is better if a business has access to cash than IOUs.
So since bitcoin has FINAL settlement, it is essentially moving actual CASH over a wire. Counter-party risk is significantly mitigated ( zero?). 
It also costs cheaper to send Bitcoins (cash) over wire than an IOU over wire. Lol! Can you believe that?

how so?

? explain please. i am genuinely interested
I recently used Mpesa to Vodacome inTZ (reverse Vodacom to Mpesa) - last week actually. Total cost was about 5.1%. 
TZ to Kenya was smooth. Kenya to TZ was rather clunky. delays,reversals, calls days on end

my friend watched this and reached out on how to get into bitcoin. I just met with him last week. I haven't watched it, he recounted the plot. He is now a bitcoin owner! :)
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:43:21
of course not. this is the bitcoin version of mainstream euphoria. Mainstream hates. We (bitcoiners) pump. 
There is obviously wild exaggeration here, which IMO is good. Anything to sell the headlines. IF Mainstreamers do it on normal fiat fin products,why not us.
Go CHina!

this was an *6+ month old* excellent video by a 'mainstream'professional who bankers can listen to. He has a wordpress blog where he breaks down the blockchain, bitcoin and cryptos for uninitiated professionals. We need more like him!
Good stuff!

well people forget that miners can be traders/speculators or whatever else they chose. So this assumption of miners constantly dumping their coins on the market ignores miners as other type of actors in the bitcoin ecosystem. Thus, misleading.
Remember, miners are people and have access to the information we have (and possibly more). Why would they not speculate on halving ramping up price too? what's to stop them?

warren buffet is a b(w)anker.
One of bitcoin's greatest value is as a censorship proof asset. Just look around the world and what central banks are doing - capital controls, negative interest rates etc.

private key did a maths transform that a public key can confirm.  Full Stop.


meaningful to another human. Indeed, the more that the Bitcoin community 
and the tabloid press demand a proof-of-spend and examine the results 
they're given, the more it demonstrates how humans seem to be isolated 
by cryptography not joined.

fractal patterns and underlying human behaviour.
Its like how history repeats itslef. Human civilization.
Check out Alan Watts - "The more things change, the more they remain the same"
Trouble is, you've got to kinda step out of your logical box. Or people do. Not everything can be explained in pure straight logic. The universe is complex, and so are humans as part of the universe.

The politics of Bitcoin.
Looks like HF is a significant risk going forward. For price at least
Also looks like there's some undertone of a potential coup? Or forced HF. Lots of Chinese questions on HF, core and blockstream connect and why development choices are tilted towards Core/ Blockstream. Whether or not its valid, there's impatience growing it seems. ANd i wonder if we could find ourselves in a rift in the community in the near future.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:49:57
triple currency play i suppose. USD/BTC/Local currency eg KES. The optimal solution is for bitcoin to gain traction locally - bitcoin buys i.e. local liquidity! There's is no way around that - for now.
Also, the article says this "The firm now offers a brokerage service, buying and selling bitcoin on behalf of customers" 
@_date: 2016-07-26 11:59:39
great to see
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:20:08
Looks like Coinbase has pivoted away from Bitcoin because




sounds like Core already anticipated this. Not surprised because Core has a strong team of HIGHLY experienced developers. This goes back to the crux of the blocksize debate and what people expect bitcoin to do. ie a PayPal or a reserve currency with PayPal/Visa built on top of it via payment channels.
To me, Fred's comments confirm that even he, sort agrees we should not compromise bitcoin for the sake of Payments ONLY.
TLDR: Not bad actors at all

depends on what you mean by 'pressure'.
Speculative pressure is a type of pressure. Possibly pushes up price. Markets are not always rational. Recall irrational exuberance by dude from Yale.  Robert Shiller.
So just because it can't be quantified doesn't mean it don't impact the market eg price.

Raoul Pal: "The Era Of Doing Nothing And Getting Paid For It Is Over"
Today's podcast is a little different. I speak with Raoul Pal and we cover a number of topics, running from one to another as they crop up. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I always enjoy speaking with Raoul.
For those of you who've never heard of Raoul - he is first and foremost one of the most congenial, open minded, and thoughtful guys you could ever have the pleasure of discussing the truly mind boggling and fascinating world of global macroeconomics with.
He's also a world renowned global macro investor, an investment strategist, economic historian, traveler, rum drinker, and co-founder of Real Vision TV, together with Grant Williams who I spoke with some time ago. Here's some of the topics Raoul and I cover in the podcast:
The end of financialization of the economy. The era of doing nothing and get paid for it is over. Why Raoul thinks that’s a good thing (especially if you’re an entrepreneur) and he also lays out the way to profit from it.
Why markets around the world are so fragile today and why the investment environment is so dangerous, especially for less liquid investments.
Helicopter money - as Raoul said, “We’re getting there, it just depends which format we’re going to get.”
Why debt is like 700 beers (plus Raoul’s take on the possibility of a debt jubilee).
Which chart is showing one of the biggest head and shoulders tops in history.
How Raoul looks at Bitcoin and why he thinks Bitcoin has a huge runway (but with one important caveat)... and why - on the other side - he doesn’t see a lot more runway left in startup investing, or as Raoul calls it, “lottery ticket investing”.
Why venture capital is, in fact, in a "terrifying situation".
And much more.
