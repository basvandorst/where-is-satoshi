What do you think of the current fungibility of BTC? It seems transactions have become more costly and slower than the original intent. Money that is difficult to move isn't good money. What do you think of this article:

What is the difference between this $300 device and running a Raspberry Pi with NodeOS and some docker instances on it?

The only remedy is voting. If you don't like how votes turn out then increase awareness. Look out for gerrymandering, vote for people who promote your ideals, vote for people who understand the complex socioeconomic situations with plans that amount towards how you want society to be. No one is going to be happy with everything, no one here is claiming we have a perfect system.

?? What doesn't belong to whom? I don't understand if you're trying to make a point or not. Taxation is a communal contract.

Yeah but everyone is saying it's going to 4000.

How is taxation theft? A seemingly ridiculous statement to make.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:33:50
Hate to break it to you but if you live in society amongst humans then you've accepted the terms of service. Otherwise stay away from all publically funded infrastructure like roads. 
If you believe in private property then likewise you have dotted the i's and crossed the t's. You cannot call taxation theft while not calling private property theft as well.

Falling to $500 would be great.

You neglected the second part of my statement. The same holds true for all property. You can't pick and choose which types of violent acquisition you support.

Wherever you happen to live, you choose to live there. Your neighbors, parents, community have elected officials to make the rules by which you have agreed to abide. That's the contract.

*Riiiiight*, amazing logic you got there. I'm done with you.

Well I did mining back in college when you could do it on your gpu. Then I bought some through silkroad, etc. I had them in a wallet on my old hard drive and I had completely forgotten because I wasn't following it at all.

If you believe in private property then you have committed so called "theft" yourself.
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:41:45
Let's say, hypothetically, there is no state. Committing property to your personal ownership? You are committing theft from the commons.

Where is your proposal for a better system of accountability?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:40:22
Why don't you try actual arguments instead of useless one-line quips and insults? You don't seem to have a critical thought in your head. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:58:10
Only if you consider taxation theft. The logic has to follow all the way through.
@_date: 2017-07-18 23:29:15
My argument is that if you view taxation as theft, you have to coincidentally view any private property that is claimed and held as theft simply because both require violence or the threat of violence. As I've responded before, removing something from the commons and claiming it as your own could be considered a type of theft. That's the logic you're portraying by saying taxation is theft, it cannot simply stop at taxation simply because the state is doing something you disagree with as you rely on the state many other times to *protect* your property rights as well as other goods and services.
You being offended by me doesn't really matter. You think I want your money? I have my own career and money and home, however, I understand the broader implications of what it means to be an adult in the world. You can disagree all you'd like but at the end of the day we all have to pay taxes for things we disagree with. We don't live in a vacuum where all our success can be attributed to ourselves. We all use state-funded technology every day, we all take advantage of state-funded transportation technology. You should really stop the victimhood of believing you're the only one paying taxes or that I somehow want your money.

Oh nice! I also bought at $70. Forgot I even had them for a long time but I sadly ended up selling them all at $3000. Wondering now if I should have kept some.

How do you prove you own your home? What protects your home from someone coming in and claiming it as their own?
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:33:07
Did you miss the first sentence?
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:18:52
But how IS it theft? 
We can just go round in circles if we discuss as you prefer. I believe the onus is on you since you're apparently making the claim as well.
