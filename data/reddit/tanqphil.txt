I think you will get your wish.  The first rule of personal financial management is diversify your portfolio.  There are a lot of btc millionaires with all of their assets in btc.  They have to eventually sell and buy other asset classes as a safety net.  EVEN if they truly believe btc will continue to rise, that is still true.
And that is also my guess about why the price has been falling for months.

These mobile money solutions exist in most (every?) 3rd world country and are very rarely used, even though they are built into the SIM cards.
Some issues:
-- most users don't trust the telecom company.  Complaints of missing topups, money disappearing after topups, unfair charges are common.  Mostly, these are the users not understanding the various service fees, but the users blame the phone company.
-- in the 3rd world, ignorance is an issue.  If you are 3rd grade educated, someone may have done Western Union in front of you and you have an idea of how to do it.  If no one has used mobile money, you have no idea about it and may even be hostile towards it (especially considering the distrust of the phone companies above).
-- except for remittances, money transfers are reasonably local because those are the people that you know.  It is pretty easy to take a bus 5km to pay a bill.
As someone who has spent 15 years in the 3rd world, I can't see mobile money succeeding, or btc replacing it.  There is very little use for it and Kenya was lightning strike.  
The global remittance market is a different animal: if it was possible to buy and cash out at very low markup, it could work.  Unfortunately, the 3rd world also has the largest buy/sell spreads, typically 10-20%.  Feel free to google random countries and check prices to verify.

That's hard to believe.  I have to pay all my hotels with credit card, including in Bangkok, because of expense reports and taxes.  I really don't think I have ever seen a hotel that doesn't accept them.  
Restaurants are 80/20, depending on customer base, quality and location.  Try to find a restaurant in Siam Square, for example, that doesn't take credit cards.  And the same is true of any restaurant geared to tourists (ignoring street food, of course).

Protip: set up a buying btc ad at 1-2% under Bitstamp.  Require that they meet you in a mall or bank lobby, or deposit into their bank account.  You will almost always be the highest price, and will get offers even if you have no reviews.
I did it, it works.

Yes, after they pay $1 to use a computer in an internet cafe.  And internet cafes in the 3rd world are famous for being safe and secure.  I recommend everyone do their banking there*! 
* Guaranteed not less than 1 botnet, 2 keyloggers, 3 rootkits and 4 people looking over your shoulder at your password, private key, and balance information.  Offer not good in CT, KY and UT. 
Seriously, btc has some very good uses.  But it is far from being ready for use in poor countries.  Anyone who thinks differently needs to spend 6 months here to see how poorly their image fits reality.

I won't encourage anyone directly until the software improves and the chances of losing your btc are tiny.
However, it is fairly obvious to most people that I own btc.  If they ask, I will explain everything I know.  I will not encourage them unless I am sure that they can use it safely.  I really don't enjoy being blamed for bad things happening to the naive.
I am sure, with Dark Wallet and Mycelium making huge strides, that we will see safe for noob wallets this year.
All that being said, btc is cool as hell and I would like to see everyone own some.

Everyone on LBC is shady?  Everyone using Local Trader is shady?  This is a sad state of affairs when btc owners think most other owners are money launderers.  Nearly every mention of cash and btc turns into accusations of money laundering.

I am an engineer and a business owner.  I have worked for large corporations and understand their thinking.  Bitcoin will be replaced by a cryptocurrency that is easy to use, easy to understand, harder to lose, and which fits into the way the economy currently runs (i.e., something like a crypto debit card).
It should be obvious when:
*  half the posts here are "how do I explain btc to my friends', "critics just can't understand the blockchain", "I lost XXX btc when my hd died", 'is this exchange safe?", etc.  Or my favorite: I lost 0.6 BTC because I forgot the change address...lucky miner!
* it takes a wall of text, a new computer, a fire-proof safe, and a safety deposit box to make sure you don't lose your savings...cold wallet (Yes, hyperbole...but only a little).
*  the most common use cases cited are rare for most of us (low cost 
$100 million international transfer,  anyone?)  It is even wrong for the Asian remittance market: the spread on btc buy/sell in the Philippines is 15-20%, worse than any service out there.  Note that areas with large numbers of expat Filipino workers usually have a bank branch to directly deposit into a Philippines bank account; people don't use Western Union as much as you think.  Similar spreads exist in Thailand, Cambodia, etc.
My point is this: btc is very, very difficult to understand and use, easy to lose your money, and it's benefits are marginal (ignoring the political agendas some users have).  A major company will come in with a similar idea, but will package it in a simple to use, safe wrapper and succeed.  It will likely be centralized to some extent to prevent the masses from losing their money.
TL;DR: the idea of cryptocurrency will be co opted by someone to create an easier, safer, more understandable coin.  For that reason, I am a bear on BTC.
Rain them downvotes!
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:09:00
If  prices are **rising**, you don't get the benefit dollar cost averaging.  So buy it now at $640, or wait until it gets cheaper.....someday, maybe, possibly.
You are buying bitcoin because it is an investment, right?  Then you don't want to buy because the price is rising?
@_date: 2014-07-05 08:06:31
You can't withdraw or deposit fiat.
You can pay other users in yen, usd, eur, etc., directly on the service.
You can move from btc to fiat to btc easily, without an exchange account, and apparently without all the AML/KYC crap since you don't take fiat out.
The only realistic use that I see is bubble strategy: convert to fiat at a high price, convert back to btc at a low price.  Or maybe Forex hedging.
My concern is how high the fees will be and what exchange rates they use.

A female FBI agent can't suddenly snatch the market owner's laptop off the table in the library while he is logged in, take the btc balances and start trying to track down IRL identities.  Because there is no owner.  It is decentralized.
The downside is that the slides seem to show that only 1 address can be linked to each identity/reputation.  It seems better to allow the identity owner to be able to change addresses at will, maybe by signing the transfer using the previous private key.
I hope someone does something better with this than just sell drugs and stolen credit card information.  Heaven forbid, maybe something LEGAL?

That is not shorting.  But what you describe is possible, it is even one of the examples they give on the website.
I would also like to do this.  I am not sure that it is true, but it seems less risky than having money sitting on an exchange for 1-2 months waiting for the bottom of a bubble.  Bitreserve seems safer than the Slovenian or Bulgarian exchanges.

The comments are treating this as a positive article.  It is not.  It touches (lightly) on some of the problems of using btc as a remittance method.
* Illiteracy, lack of education.
* Ignorance of what bitcoin is and how to use it. AND SAFEGUARD IT.
* Desire to have fiat cash, which is usable everywhere. 
* In addition: private access to a reliable smartphone to run a wallet, or safe (no keyloggers, no viruses, no one watching over your shoulder at an internet cafe) access to a computer.
* Why would anyone think that agents who convert btc to fiat at the receivers location won't charge fees?  How will they pay rent, salaries, etc, for the agents in each location? Please don't say small Laotian mountain towns should use btc for all their spending, it won't happen.  The **poor and desperate** take jobs as maids and construction workers in foreign countries, not the educated.
People who write these articles or believe these articles have never been to the 3rd world.  Every problem is surmountable....except when they aren't.
In reply to the average 9% fee claim:  I would like to see how they got those numbers.  In countries with a high population of immigrant workers sending money home, there are always cheap ways of doing it.  Even Western Union (probably the most expensive remittance option) has VIP cards  with reduced rates for frequent senders.

Mycelium gives 3 or 4 warnings before deleting the private key, so it sounds like you imported the public key from somewhere. Since the address is not yours, you can not spend the address.
If it was your own address, Mycelium has a big warning on the opening screen saying you need to make a backup. This appears again everytime you add a new address.

They can make it basically useless by closing down methods of converting to fiat.  If bitcoin can't pay bills in the real world (remember, the question is about the government banning btc), you must convert.
Take a look at BTC-e.  There was a long thread 3 days ago about how to get money out.  It devolved into discussion of OKPay, EgoPay, vouchers, difficulty with expensive wire transfers (bank fees, correspondent bank fees), etc. Verification at some of the money transmitters is worse than for an exchange.  And, of course, when the money reaches your bank, records are kept by the bank, SWIFT, IBAN or whoever is involved.
Or look at Bitstamp, running scared of the US government and reverifying verified customers when they try to withdraw.
My opinion before was that there would always be countries that would host anonymous exchanges and more importantly enable money transfers.  Cambodia? Myanmar? How about the Caymans? Unfortunately,  money transfers are a global system that is easily controlled and monitored.  If you are in a developed country, the government still knows your bank transfer came from that foreign btc exchange.
So: if governments want to ban btc, they will be able to functionally succeed until the day that daily expenses can be paid in btc instead of fiat or **until an anonymous method fiat transfer is devised**.
@_date: 2014-04-03 20:26:31
Less complications: you are paying (on average) a big price premium, so your capital gains will be less. :D
But seriously, check out the small direct sellers.  I use one, and it is about 3% off the Bitstamp price.  Fast, too.  Deposit cash into their bank account, confirm the payment, receive coins within minutes.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:30:41
The **spreads** are often inflated.  I have seen $70 spreads buy to sell. 
The best advice is try it with small amounts, check the numbers, then send larger amounts.
I am not picking on the Philippines.  The spread in Thailand isn't great either.

It is a tourist destination. Maybe he ran out of cash. Which means I don't have much of a chance of him being there when I arrive.
Also, Asia is different. I can not get verified at a major exchange, except maybe BTC_e, because the documents they need are not available. The best example is utility bills; they are always kept in the landlord's name.  Expats are a corner case that are not made allowances for. That means using brokers who charge 5 to 8 percent, or trying to find a bank that week allow you to open a USD account.
@_date: 2014-04-12 10:19:23
And prevent btc from being liquid, limiting its usefulness for moving large amounts of money.
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:56:37
You have to do KYC/AML on small sites.  The difference is that I got verified in **hours**, not weeks.  I actually called the owner and talked to him, answered questions, emailed documentation, and was finished.
That is unlike Coinbase, according to the dozens of complaints.  
Also, as I posted before, I don't have a utility bill in my name because I rent short-term and travel constantly for business.  We worked out alternative proof, unlike major companies that don't give a fuck if you get verified or not.
The only issue that I can see is that a customer probably could not buy or sell hundreds of coins in a day.  But that will never happen in my case.

i had something similar happen to me today.
I am verified with a local broker (not exchange) who sells at a small markup.  He has my passport, copy of my apartment lease, my phone number, and email.  I have made 4 purchases over the last few months using bank deposit.
Today, I tried to buy more.  The company demanded tax returns, bank statements, and papers from my company verifying my job.  They refused to talk to the bank, to vouch for me.  No, that is not an exaggeration.  I didn't lose anything (except that nice run up in price today), but I am apparently no longer welcome as a customer.
i think any company dealing with btc is running scared of AML.  If i had spent similar amounts on anything, **anything**, besides btc, I would be considered a decent/good customer.  (Anyone want to trade a brand new dishwasher for bitcoin?  I will run down to the mall and buy it...)
Now I have to find a place to buy that doesn't require a utility bill, or has reasonable buy limits without full verification.

Flooz was a mainstream product, usable by anyone with no prior knowledge necessary.
BTC is tough.  I am an engineer, but I still double and triple check everything I do, out of fear of losing a lot of money.  The only product that I have seen that is easy to use and reasonably safe is Mycelium.  As long as you don't lose your backup and your password, you are good.  Sending, receiving are easy as pie.  Unfortunately, it is a phone app and  people lose phones.
I own btc.  Hell, I own more than 50 btc.  But I would never try to teach my gf or a regular person how to use bitcoin.  Sad, but true.  Someday, the complexity will be hidden and software will be ready for grandmothers...but that day is not today.

You could be right, but it is more than the French guy:
- “We discovered that almost all these large transactions were the descendants of a single large transaction involving 90,000 Bitcoins which took place on November 8th 2010, and that the subgraph of these transactions contains many strange looking chains and fork-merge structures, in which a large balance is either transferred within a few hours through hundreds of temporary intermediate accounts, or split into many small amounts which are sent to different accounts only in order to be recombined shortly afterwards into essentially the same amount in a new account.” (source: Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph.”
"The most damning fact revealed in the paper is not the extreme top-heaviness of the Bitcoin ownership pyramid, but rather the elaborate lengths to which the hoarders went in order to conceal their existence from “rank and file” users. Think of it! Hundreds of thousands of shill accounts, with vast rivers of wealth moving back and forth – for one purpose only: to deceive. None of it was done by accident."

The issue is that btc is not a good store of value.  You have no idea what your coins will be worth in the future.
I have a buddy who did something similar.  He owned a small bar/hotel in Laos, and kept all of his profits in cash in a safe.  When he planned to sell, he started buying btc so he could get the money out of the country (Laotian banks are not safe, even if foreign owned.  Deposits disappear, your account disappears.)  
The last that I heard, he had 350 or 400 coins and was still buying.  He has also, by my estimates, lost 30-40% of his money.    If the price recovers, he will break even.  If not, he worked years only to lose much of his earnings.

The price is determined by its inelastic nature and consumer demand.  The algorithm can't create more coins when demand rises, and can't destroy coins when demand falls, so the price is highly volatile.  In short, if BTC believers want the price to rise, they need to increase demand.

As someone who travels internationally between 20 and 30 days per month, please, tell me more.  I checked your website, and it has the standard landing pages, but no content.


How exactly are you traveling using only bitcoins?  Getting on localbitcoins in each and every country, and arranging to spend hours to meet someone to buy local currency?  Depositing coins into a stranger's account, then praying that you actually receive the local cash?  And paying the 15-20% markup?
What fees are you talking about?  I have never paid a cent to a money changer...any fee is included in the rate.  Maybe credit card fees?  The way to handle that is to pay big bills with credit cards (hotels, flights), exchange cash only for incidental expenses.  The 3-10% credit card cash advance fee is still less than the markups on localbitcoins.
If you plan to use your credit card while traveling, you simply call the issuer and give your itinerary.  I have had a problem once in the last 12 years with having to call the bank to get the card re-enabled.  It took 4 minutes.
TL;DR: this looks like transparent ad spam from someone who has never left their home country.  Apologies to the sub, but this stuff is really annoying.

Regarding the wealth distribution, you have to remember that estimates say that 30% of all btc mined are zombies (lost keys, lost wallet, etc.).  
If the blockchain says 1000 people have 40% of the coins, it is likely closer to 10%.  Many of the early miners discarded or lost their coins, and the coins have never moved from the original address.

Ok, my opinion: I buy when I have spare cash.  I have bought 1xx coins since March, at prices between $360 and $640.  I bought another 1 btc today at $546 (I had money in my pocket, I got an email offer at a good price, so I bought).  I don't give a f*ck about the auction, TA, or the rest; I am a long term bull.
Based on this, buy the coins.  Unless you want to play day trader, the 3% over/under on the current price is meaningless.
Edit: You have a significant amount of money.  If you want to cost average, put an ad on LocalBitCoins offering to buy $2-3000 per day at 1% under Bitstamp.  You will eventually get your $20k in coins.  But, honestly, just buy the coins now.
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:04:35
I have tried all of those listed during trips to the PI.  You should mention that the major Localbitcoin sellers are also involved in those businesses above.  There seem to only be a few major players in the country.
Coinxchange.ph is by far the best of the group.  Their prices are usually a bit below Bitstamp, so they must be buying from BTC-e.  1% fee, like Coinbase, and excellent, fast service.  I have recommended them to people sending remittances to the Philippines.

I disagree.  No one Googles bitcoin every time they think about buying in.  If they researched it last year, last month, last week, there is no need to search Google again.

Did you try to use the internet in '89 or '90?  Iti was terribly difficult to use, writing connection scripts, playing with modem command strings, figuring out gopher/WAIS,  etc.  By the mid-90's, it was easy enough for everyone to use; thank the WWW protocol and AOL for a lot of that.
In short, that might be the issue you are seeing: it WAS very difficult, but later it WAS easy/mainstream.  Bitcoin is still in its commandline, write a script to connect to a server, spend hours figuring out how to use an email program that uses a "." on an empty line to signal end of message.
TL;DR: Bitcoin needs a better, safer user interface.

Great post.  No one here seems to understand that poor countries have little in common with rich ones.  "Bitcoin will replace Western Union."  Without offices in every corner of poor countries?  Without bank accounts tied to exchanges?  Without even ID (very common) to open a bank account (or exchange account)?
Bitcoin fees may be minuscule, but you still have to have live people to handle the transfer and give out the cash.  Boom, fees to pay those people.
With regard to btc brokers in 3rd world countries, they are mostly ripoffs.  My buddy paid $50 over market yesterday to buy a bitcoin.  They commonly won't give you the current market rate, they will give you the worst rate in the last 24 hours minus fees.  Selling is even worse.

How many coins were seized in the Silk Road bust?  175,000, at least.
Silk Road did 6.5M BTC in business, according to the FBI, and DPR had 600,000 BTC in commissions from those sales in his wallet.  Some coins were used more than once, of course, but SR is just ONE darknet site.
If there are only 12M BTC, and many have never been used since they were mined (Nakamoto alone has 1-1.5M), and others are being held long term (Winklevii, etc.) possibly as few as 6M are actively circulating.  Anyone have a better number for this?
That would mean that about 13% of the coins are **currently** linked to SR, plus the coins that were used to buy and sell.  Taking into account the number of other dark net sites, it looks like the odds are good that a particular coin has been used for illegal purposes at least once.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:20:27
Gain: if btc was somehow outlawed (how?), anyone using it would automatically be a money laundering suspect.  "Who else would still be using it?" the government would reason.  Today, some small percentage of transactions are for illegal activities; if you drive out legitimate users, you are left with a target-rich environment.
Loss: not much, unless btc accelerates rapidly in other countries and shows real usefulness.

That is not the problem.  Buying bitcoins anonymously is ridiculously easy.  
The problem is that BTC has a chokepoint at the withdraw fiat stage.   Ultimately, people need fiat for everything.  How do you get the money anonymously?
The only ways that I know are 1) localbitcoins, 2) using a shady exchange to load fiat into an equally shady anonymous debit card (both with high fees).  And that is  difficult to trust: the cards get blocked suddenly and deposits seized. 
Ultimately, no government will care if you own cryptocurrencies.  They will monitor everything at the withdrawal stage.  Hence, KYC and AML rules.

I have a soid reason.  It is impossible unless every coin is assumed dirty. Most peope who believe the government can impliment this don't understand the blockchain; bitcoins do not have serial numbers.  The blockchain only says, "This address has this many coins, and they were transferred from this address on this date."
If I wanted to clean my coins, I would dump them into Satoshi Dice, then withdraw to a new address, then repeat with a few more gambling sites in random countries.  Or dump them into an altcoin exchange, buy DRK, transfer to another exchange or 3, then convert to btc and withdraw to another address.
Note that these are possible for small amounts of btc, 1-100 btc.  To launder thousands of coins would require much more work and be a bit simpler to trace.  Which is why drug cartels and the Mafia don't use btc.
Cash is the ultimate money laundering and dirty money currency. Not bitcoin.  The clean/dirty btc issue is silly on many levels.

Suit yourself.  It won't feel any easier at $2000.

Interesting, and potentially high value.  What is the current status of the project?

This is a chance to win over new users, not a chance to preach to the choir.  It should be payable in whatever currency the customer wants.

I am on both sites.  Of my 4 friends with coins, no one else is a member.  They go to bitcoinity to check prices and various btc news websites, but not forums.
They have high stress jobs; no reddit at work, no time at home, but money to buy in.

You are using real btc in Darkwallet?  It is alpha software; the devs recommended testnet only.

Still a little sparse in some parts of the world; I can actually pick myself out on the map!  Hopefully, after another month, the map will fill in.

$675.  A recovery to that level, no more bubbles.

"I ain't touching bitcoin.  It is for drugs and child porn.  Just look, that guy on the news talking about bitcoin was caught with child porn."

35% of 300 million is 105 million people.
Today, about 2-3M people in the world own bitcoins.
Cool!  The USA alone can increase adoption 40X.

It's that fucking Debbie's fault.....

How many questions have you seen posted here on creating paper wallets?  About losing money from paper wallets due to a change address not being saved?  About transactions stalled because no miner's fee was included?  About unencrypted wallets being stolen? 
Just a few quick examples, all of which can be handled by better, easier software.  I won't even mention the privacy risks that exist in most products. 
I will predict that replies will blame the user.  Remember, the question is why is adoption slow, i.e., noobs.  The learning curve needs to be flattened.

On the infographic, look at their example partners, check their buy/sell and terms.  Horrible markups, horrible pricing system.  I hate to be cynical, but I expect this company will be the same....no fees, **just 10-20% off the real exchange rate**.  Or we deliver your coins in 24 hours, at the worst rate that occurs during that time.  Cheap, right?
You pay 4-7% with Western Union.  I will bet that easily beats the deals you are going to get remitting bitcoin.  Instead, deposit in a partner bank of BPI, BDO, etc., to get cheap transfers.  It will take a long while before a legitimate and cheap method of remitting btc to the Philippines is available.
Also, there are dozens of businesses that accept bitcoin.  But they do it themselves, to get decent prices.


I don't want to be a prick, but you do realize that the terminal would be worth several years sales in a decent sized sari sari?   I have not been in the Philippines in 6 months, but I have never met a Filipino outside of Manila who had heard of bitcoin.

This isn't the '90's.  Last guy I know who wanted to Bangkok was paying close to $200 per night.  Those 6btc/mo ($2700 USD) won't last long if he is out whoring around.

Ask what is going on with their verification and re-verification issues.  Is this due to new pressure from the government, is it a proactive step to head off potential future problems, or what?

YOU were there in the beginning?


You were on the cypherpunks maillist?  You had lunches with Tim May?  You replied to Jim Bell about his assassination politics essay?  You got doxxed by the list on your first post because you did not use a mail mixer?  You fought the good fight about encryption being controlled as a munition?  You argued on the ramifications  of Echelon?   You worried every time John Young got arrested over Cryptome? Bullshit wannabe.
No, some of US were there.  We know what bitcoin (before it was a gleam in Nakamoto's eye) was supposed to do.  It was **not** about drugs, gambling, money laundering and tax evasion.  That is what the real world did to a perfect idea.  Freedom is not the same as permission to be a criminal. You are a side effect, not the goal.

I am 900km from the nearest seller.  I hope that improves over the next few weeks.  But next month, I will be at a location with a seller doing -5% Bitstamp price.  Yeah!!
