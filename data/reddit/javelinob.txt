Lets us know after two years how stress affecting your life, Bitcoin should be about 250k each... 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:57:22
Guys, let make Bitcoin better. Why you investing you time into this shit fight? Lets compete on features and development and adoption.

They have dominance in miners making, not hashing. They business  is to sell miners to other and others can mine in whatever pool they want. They have small mining operation, but not 51. Latest news by canaan and Innosillicon announced 7 nm chips and looks like Bitmain have slowest miners on 16 nm chips right now, so everything could change very fast.

He was main face of Bankera ICO who got 100+ mils in it and have invested into several blockchain statups. He have Blockchain centre in Vilnius. Nothing new.

Falkvinge for a long time is a fighter for privacy. He created Pirate Party. He invested a shitload of money in 2011 in bitcoin by understanding how it is working. Right now you are shiting on a person without any reason... 
We all know what we signed for in 2009-2011 and what made us rich... Right now we see that Bitcoin becoming a little bit different than we signed for in first place. 
It's really frustrating for me to see the community in a fight and pissing on peoples who made a lot for it to succeed in early days/years.

On average :D I'm talking about spam attacks and due to this reason they setup 1 mb limit. 
Can you explain how it is possible to do it without running it? In 2009 no one told you to have to prove Bitcoin will work, then we will use it... It's making me wonder what is on your mind... To keep full node with few hundred gigs is all ok, but downloading a few megs every ten minutes will not work? cmon... 
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:41:19
I hope they will choose not to use segwit at all.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:48:21
I don't see how it will be less decentralized if blocks will grow... 90% of miners agreed to make Segwit2X. Big blocker made consensus decision to allow segwit for 2x, right now other side is pushing back from consensus by doing shady things and if you look, we losing a lot. With more capacity, fewer altcoins would be created. Actually right now we are losing a lot. 
We are losing marketshare.
We are looking new markets.
We are losing POW.
We are losing business with lots transactions.
We losing new users to altcoins.

Basic income needs a lot of research, even organizations like ycombinator doing big research around it. I think you dont understand economics for basic income, and how it can save and optimize government. Just think how much fewer jobs will be needed to make socialistic things like giving charity, compensating for a house... This services from government need shitloads of jobs. Basic income will give this money automatically without needing mln of government workers to check what status person has, how much he earns, is it got a job, and we should take from his some help or not... shitloads of workers. IT can be more libertarian than whatever we have right now and more efficient. 
Make a little bit more research about libertarians and basic income -

Then we need big corps to come into mining business, but right now we limiting it and trying to say, that users with raspberry pie should mine, which is stupid. We need US and Russian governments to mine, and they will never agree on anything.

The ONLY thing keeping Bitcoin alive in such value right now is because of miners. They invested most of the money into keeping Bitcoin, so telling, that they can do something, that hurts Bitcoin after investing hundreds millions is a little bit irrational. 
Who is more interested in Bitcoin future, you who have Rasberie pie node and crying for big blocks, or companies who invested hundreds millions into mining? If you think, that's why miners want global growth of Bitcoin as cash system, because they will get millions of small transactions fees, not a few larger transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:01:33
Actually, BitFury says, that full nodes are just nodes, who downloads and checks network, but can't include or decide what to include or not into the network. If network will fork, such nodes just follow. So it's not full MINING nodes.
So for me it seems, you dont understand for what full nodes is about and what use cases it has. you making false assumptions.

Luke wants to make blocksize 300 kb... maybe miners testing small blocks...
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:24:57
I want big blocks. Big blocks described in original Bitcoin paper. I want Satoshi vision, not politics. I want, that my Bitcoin would be worth much more, and on global scale Bitcoin is nothing. I want it to be global cash, gold, investment etc...
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:49:11
I will use whatever I want and what get me most profit. I'm believer in Bitcoin, not other coins 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:51:12
I only see talk from Core and Luke, that we should make blockchain size 300 kb. I dont want such fork.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:57:10
Blockchain have to have all records. If you had company, you knew, that accounting is number first priority in company.
But depending on your business you can prune whatever you want from your blockchain. You can even use SPV client and dont keep blockchain at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:53:01
Well is you have assets, the you can change at current rate, so it means something... 
I'm not against segwit, but in 3 years nothing was done and we are losing marketshare and value. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:44:34
If Luke proposed to lower blocksize to 300 kb and it make sense for some, then Antpool decided to lower to 0... They both can do what they want, no? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:43:02
Big Blocker made consensus and agreed to push Segwit... No we are waiting from you guys consensus to push 2x
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:48:16
I will use whatever I want... It's not your business what I use... I signed for Bitcoin in 2009 with this vision and we will fight for it from noobs like you
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:24:39
Do you even understand why he is big blocker? Because he joined Bitcoin in 2010 and it was promised to do. I joined in 2011 and we all dreamed about competing with Visa on blockchain. Now you telling, that he is big blocker he lost credibility? And about a socialistic thing... do you even understand what you are talking about? Or your intention just to atack?
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:32:56
I'm thinking if you really believe what you write? Do you even understand how this all sounds from the side? Who cares about initial sync, then users pay for high fees? I have hope, that this your stance is not what are you really believe. For simple user sync DOES NOT MATTER, what matters is fast transactions and cheap ones. Users dont need to keep full nodes, because they dont do anything if they not mining. I think the only reason to keep full node, if LAW requires you to keep some log of transactions, etc... 
And for the record, Luke IS NOT technically reasonable and it very shame of you to tell that. There is no logical explanation for this.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:47:57
do you understand, that decentralization comes from connectivity. If you think, that full non mining nodes have some impact on what is included into the blockchain, you are really wrong. Only miners include transaction. If your full node does not agree on chain it will just stop at that point... blockchain will live on and that raspberry pie node will do nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:41:03
But Gavin still believes that CWS is Satoshi... Did you saw interview there he told why he things? Its not only, that he signed a message, it a lot more.. talk, emails, etc... So it possible, that other company who heavily invested don't want Satoshi, because they will lose credibility f being experts. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:04:51
... accept to software. Blockchain already has it included, so the software, if not accept, will stop or fork and accept again new blockchain. It doesn't have the ability to change something. Only mining nodes can.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:16:24
Big blocks were working in 2009 and had all your points. It's working in BCH now too. So basically it's only Blockstream who don't want it. So it's pure politics. 
Even now with Segwit 2x, most miners agreed and pushed consensus to reach segwit and 2x, but now, one organization pushing strong against it. It's blockstream. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:14:49
We have a lot of info about SegWit and risk with it, which is not allowed here to post and talk about it. Maybe some of it can be true, some not, but it's not allowed to talk about it here... 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:54:02
Did you read the code of bitcoin software? It was pure economics. Due to the low fee, right now all fee would be very valuable and spam attack will cost millions, so it would be money, not attack.
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:50:54
Home users have they network firewalled by default. I'm not saying its ok, but you made a point that it is somehow bigger deal then its actually is. And by Bitmain acctions it shows, that they thinking the same.
@_date: 2019-02-09 08:26:19
Can you explain a little bit more, how a lot of non mining nodes will enforce new rules? I can see how they can reject mining nodes consensus, but I can't see how withtou mining on new rulset they will do it. If they not mining and new blocks wont come out, new consensus rules will not go alive  in any way.
@_date: 2019-02-08 13:05:18
Can you explain for what you will use it? eshop or some app or what?
If you are not using for some work, it will just slow down the network, because then the miner mines a new block, he will be sending it to other miners to verify. Additional non-mining nodes, just use traffic from mining nodes and slow down the network. If miners decide that block is good, and your node decided that it's not good, it will not be able to change what miners decide anyway.
I have a full node too, use it for my business to confirm payments.
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:42:34
I think you are wrong... Who cares if one person knows vulnearbilities. Big corps keeps miners under firewall and if sameone will hack it, it can be reset like in five minutes.
@_date: 2019-02-09 12:58:34
Well... I'm using Bitcoin from 2011, but switching to POS is biggest shit i heard...

Look, for years Bitmain ASIC passwords are know to everyone and noone changes them. I didin't hear about any hack yet... I dont see a problem here anyways. Second thing, I never heard of ASIC having public IP address...

If you can have cash and gold in one, why you choose to have only gold?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:44:10
Right now Bitcoin is SAVING, because then a lot of people want to spend fast Bitcoins, the network will lag. So yes, its pushing to keep it longer, but it means, that if you want to leave fast it can't be possible at some point.  It a little bit reminds me my bank, then I have spending limits, and can't exit fast if I need.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:59:56
Why someone wanted to invest if every day we have ten's of topics with talking that pow will be changed. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:42:13
In my opinion "hypothetical" is enough reason don't invest half billion dollars (or at least few hundred million) to get into mining. 
We have one company who invested a lot of money into ASIC's and a few bankrupt companies. Do you think huge corps don't see how miners are treated? 
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:46:42
you gave 6 point. 5 of them are right if you use node for something. The other is not right. You right that it grows the network, but you slow transaction time because your node dont do nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:02:23
If you look back, then yes. It's very good investment. If you look to future, its huge risk with the possibility to a huge profit. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:23:33
You better work, to invite more huge corporations into mining space, because right now it sounds like you want to destroy the business of companies who invested hundreds millions dollars into space. Do you think they will invest into Bitcoin after POW change? No. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:04:36
Bitcoin for tech win! We already using ASIC's

Looking at your argument we should pause bitcoin grow because we don't want big corps to invest billions into bitcoin value? 
Right now, bitcoin is created by using shitload of energy. the more energy we use, the more valuable and secure document is created. right now, you say, that we have to change PoW?
By changing PoW you will make the network more vulnerable by putting at risk security and bilions of investments made to network...
It really looks stupid if you think about it... Then you change PoW all who invested gets all investments lost (billions dolars) and do you think, that new company who will be able to first invest in research and optimization of mining new PoW will be better? 
Between, how do you think? Who has to propose new PoW algorithm? Maybe they right now as I'm writing this post investing millions into their own asic of new PoW? Who knows?
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:25:46
You wrong... How can government close down the global network? They even can even make laws together, not be talking about closing GLOBAL network.
And you wrong, because the MORE big companies come to mine and use the network, the harder would be to close it down. If Google, Apple, Amazon, Alibaba, some russian and chinese companies would come to mine bitcoin do you think government had the power to close it down? One lawsuit against Google search results can go for 3-5 years, not talking about global companies. Who cares about little shity raspberries? 
Did you know, that Bitcoins network power is not from little nodes with 8 connections, but with big ones, who can handle thousands, because they can send info to thousands of nodes in seconds. How about telling milions ISPS around the world to filter that then we can't filter bittorent yet?
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:47:13
Did you look at his research before 2008? Did you look at his contracts with gov agencies and how positive they talking about him? Did you look about him what other reputable persons says, like Dave Kleiman, Bear, Ian Greg, Jon Matonis? Did you look at his blue/red security certificates who proves he one of the best in the security field? Did you read, that it is debunked almost all things, some people use to make him liar and scammer already and other accusations I hope will be debunked in coming weeks.

Block size does not matter on matters you are talking about... This is my point... Is it 1 mb or 10 mb, anyway this will happen, but you looking to narrow, not global... We have offshore companys, offshore banks, and with bitcoin will have it too... GLOBAL

Maybe he was doing PhD in that moment and didin;t have it yes, so university told, that he dont have PhD, but not mentioned, that he is doing it right then. Craig put it on linkedin, but newer mentioned to have it like I understand right now... So he was not lying, maybe media put it on this way?

Do you really think, that if big corporations like Amazon, Intel, Google started to mine, they would not make research into how optimize mining and compete? Do you think they would open source own research? How ASICBoost matters then we are talking about GLOBAL competition?
Talking about segwit... do you think it is the safest way? How about changing one number? It's more simple and it was done before, so it actually works.
