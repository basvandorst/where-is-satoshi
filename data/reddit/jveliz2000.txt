$90 for me in bitcoins, waiting for it to hit below 8.5 k if it ever will. I’m new to this sort of thing, I’m 18, only investing what I can afford to lose. Hopefully I’ll have some Swiss accounts open by my 30’s.

No worries I understand what it’s like to being poor and trying to invest to get some money. It’s just that when your poor, you have to work twice as hard when it comes to this because you can’t afford the loss. Be smart study past patterns, know all the techniques etc. this is a 50/50 chance that’ll success. Know your losses and gains. Everything you do will be virtuous if you work hard at it in life. Bless and hope you find what your looking for in bitcoin

If you have no debt, no bills, and you don’t have any one who relies on you for incomes. Say your allowances are $100, out $30 in bitcoin. Use 30% of you allowance, only do what you can afford. And that’s only if don’t owe anyone any money. And I mean banks colleges friends etc
