Wish I had known before. I know CC payments are reversible. I shouldve assumed that e-transfers are as well. Lack of brainwork on my part. Or I'm gullible.

just finished talking to the fraud department and they confirmed that all transfers that day were unauthorized.. i made 2 transactions that day, so one other transfer was reversed on me for $300.. this one was with a different user, but could have potentially been the same person.. very frustrated, but im happy that i didnt go ahead and make any more transactions that day because i was considering selling all my bitcoins.. even at the current rate and with my loss of 4 or so bitcoins, im still ahead and making a profit.. so at least i didnt LOSE any of my initial investment :)

i dont have to do anything if my bitcoins are on blockchain.info, right? Most of my btcs are in a paperwallet thats linked to blockchain.info as "watch only"

I plan on looking into the situation further when I get back home later. On my way to work atm; won't be home for about 7-8 hours. Thanks for the support :)

ive got bitcoins! yay!
on another note, one thing still confuses me.. what is the purpose of backing up your wallet regularly? its not possible to backup a cold paper wallet, is it? when backing up a wallet, are you simply backing up the bitcoin addresses associated with it? if i only have one bitcoin address, is there a need to back it up regularly after every transaction?
ex. if one day at 50 btc i backup my wallet.. then the next day i received another 50 btc into the same address but didnt backup.. and my wallet was lost somehow or whatever case backups are useful for.. and i only had a backup to my wallet when it was at 50 btc.. does that mean id only be able to retreive/spend 50 btc as opposed to 100? in other words, if i dont backup regularly, is it like when youre writing an essay and your comp dies just as you finish typing the 1500th word, but the last save you did was at 900 words?

ive given up on mining.. i dont find the rewards worth the time invested in mining.. i was looking more to purchasing bitcoins, but even that seems a little complicated

Why is btcquick the only place that accepts credit cards? What is the issue with buying btc using credit or paypal?

Yes please!

"The 8-character code you see on the outside of the coin is the first eight characters of the Bitcoin address assigned specifically to that coin" can you import an wallet using only 8 characters?

exact same shit happened to me with cibc.. so fuckin pissed right now.. im gonna close all my accounts associated with the big 5 and change to a btc friendly bank.. any recommendations/options in canada?
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:02:33
oh i put "active=$" then my address.. i included the $ sign which mightve been the problem
@_date: 2013-02-16 08:55:51
but if i never send money from my paper wallet, then there shouldnt ever be a reason for a client or server to change the address right?
@_date: 2013-02-20 18:08:41
when you go to the link for coin 135Kc4Gb, it shows the full address.. if i try that with the first 8 characters of my own address, it doesnt work.. are these 8 character public keys different from regular public keys you see?

this should already be up and running for pregame.. why has it not happened!

exactly! i read this too. i was certain that once the money is deposited, that its a done deal..
@_date: 2013-02-16 08:54:48
if you create a paper wallet only to send btcs to it (kind of like a savings account so to speak) could it still be the case that the old address will be disposed of and replaced by a new one?? I think youre saying that if I were to send some btcs from my address abc1 to a friends xyz1.. the amount im sending would go to xyz1 and the remaining balance would then be put into a new address abc2 (which would still be owned my me its just that the address was updated for increased anonymity).. is this correct? 
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:21:28
or is it that the addresses associated with that wallet are being backed up?
ex. i have 2 addresses linked to my wallet. one has 50 btc. and theres a backup of it. i created the second one after the backup and received another 50 btc but into the new account. shit happens. i recover from my backup but only 1 address is associated with it. the "new" address with the new 50 btcs is lost because i dont have the address and/or privkey.

yea, im considering closing my accounts. but it seems like canadian banks are opposing bitcoin businesses anyway. but wth, do i even need a bank account? ive never thought of NOT having one. i wonder if i could live without one. i could live without bank/interac/visa/mc/amex. but i get paid in cheques, where would i cash them?
@_date: 2013-02-18 22:43:17
if i use incognito and go to bitaddress.org to make a paper wallet and print it while being disconnected from the internet, is it still possible for someone to hack my wallet? there shouldnt be any history or keylog that could give away my address and private key, right? is there a need to boot from a livecd, ubuntu, linux, etc?
@_date: 2013-02-15 18:16:58

I haven't filed a police report yet, but I've contacted localbitcoins and notified them of the incident. I've also left a message at the fraud department and am waiting to hear back from them; I will look into filing a claim when they call back.

im new to bitcoins as well, but its my understanding that as long as you have your bitcoin address and its private key, you should be able to access your wallet from any client.. to add to this question though, my wallet must have a private key (of which im unaware of).. so my private key must be stored somewhere on my client then?.. if so, is there a way for me to find out what my private key is? if thats the case, couldnt someone hack into my computer and find out my private key? and if im unable to find out what my private key is through my client, then how can i know what my private key is?
