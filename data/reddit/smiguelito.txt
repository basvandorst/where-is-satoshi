I wouldn't consider this a milestone this sounds like typical Mob mentality Bs, government officials probably aren't keen enough to conciously pump the market like they are claiming.

You can do that, check your state laws I think some like Washington state require you to posses  a money transmitting liscences. They do set up stings, last summer a man was busted although he literally told the undercover officer he was laundering money.

Put it in ethereum, while I think replacing a baseless money with with a baseless decentralized cryptographically secure currency is a step in the right direction, I think it completely sidesteps what needs to be fixed with money.

Purse.io is good. You can get a discount on everything since the people filling the order will pay a premium to turn their Amazon gift cards into bitcoin. I picked up a 1070 GTX last year for $355 during cyber monday deals marked down from $484.  Bought a lot of raspberry pi parts

Toshi wallet will link to your coinbase account if a wallet is what your going for. Coinbase app functions as a wallet on behalf of your coinbase account but it is ultimately a portal to there exchange.

@_date: 2018-06-06 07:33:41
if you dont mind getting bogged down by the ACH (t+2) i definitely recommend doing it, definitely much easier to set low buy orders and forget about them if your not impatient. in the end you will still have your cash.

Or if a recession happens institutions will liquidate crypto holdings first in a pinch because it is strange, new, and risky sending it farther down.

Thermo electric generators places around the outside of a storage containers with the mining rigs inside, if you lived somewhere with a large temperature difference between the outside and inside you could sap some power.

Get a pop can and a tap and die. Cut the can open so that you have a sheet of aluminum and hammer your private and public key in, boom hardware wallet. You can also just buy dog tag blanks.
 None of this is worth finding out wether your wallet is being generated in good faith by a third party.

I agree. For me its Overspeculation, and frivolous regulation. That's it, the tech can come at whatever pace necessary for it to be what it will become, but overspeculation could hamper it in the near future, especially if crypto companies can't do business because of regulations. I think enterprise chains maintained by private businesses will boom in the coming years, they will be faster, they will offer a little transparency  but it will work with the broader public network. We will have to deal with the fact that some will not do business with an immutable ledger, and other the opposite (obviously).
