So what's going to happen when this wall is gone?

and internet message boards have always been right, 100% of the time, so... *party on*

Thanks! I'm just trying to make sure it's possible, not actually do it yet. Just going to keep holding it all. :D

so... on coinbase, if you want to link your bank account to transfer money... it asks for your bank login and password?
this cannot be... reasonable? why is this happening?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:53:05
OK cool... I have the password and recovery keys for the electrum wallet. I assume I can export the private keys if I have those? I'm not going to do it at this point, I just want to know if that's possible.

if i had some old bitcoin from 3 years ago sitting in an electrum wallet, is that BTC now both BTC and BCH? Or just BTC? I've already put the BTC onto a ledger nano S, but now reading about BCH and forks I'm worried I left something behind.

Heh... it turns out tonight's not a good night to try to verify a bank account on Coinbase:
"Identity verification is failing to complete for a significant number of customers due to high traffic. We are working on restoring services as soon as possible."

When events of that scale happen, the powers that take over are usually like, "Oh, you have a bunch of assets that undermine the new regime's control? Nice! Your execution is scheduled for 3:30, please wait in queue D."
