Now I’m gonna binge watch Money Heist on Netflix.

Thank you. Most concise remark I’ve read on this thread. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:45:10
I certainly appreciated both your separate points. I’m also of the understanding that cryptocurrency can certainly be centralized.

Nobody holds for long term. We hodl.

Join the club. Bought 100 BTC at $110, sold them at $113, felt like a baller for making $300 in 10 days lol. Those were the days. No exchanges. Just hard core nerd wallet nonsense.
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:34:31
Aha. That’s actually pretty important to understand. Thanks for the post. Helped me realize I did not get this.

No problems. 
Yea and you had railway lords, bandits, no reliable drinking water nor sewage systems, you had no voting rights for women, rampant racism and bigotry, you had barely any health care and shitty roads, but sure, if you were a farmstead owning white male with a rifle and 40 cows, the country was yours.

Care to elaborate? I thought difficulty gets increased over time does it not? And hardware improvements may occasionally lower the expense but in the long term it should still be more expensive to mine a coin, no?
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:41:02
As does yours.

Because as a government you can simply pass a law requiring all companies and citizens to adopt your coin whether it’s shit or not.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:39:30
I’m not so sure. Maybe BTC really becomes nothing more than a simple SOV platform that’s easier than using gold. In the end, government can not function without the ability to audit transactions and considering that companies operating exchanges must observe regulations of their host country, it’s evident that things are already regressing. 
Look at Coinbase. You have to prove your identity. So already transaction privacy has evaporated. They may not be able to adopt new technologies. But they can force the businesses who utilize technologies to adapt to regulatory imperatives.

You’re making me hungry with your pizza talk. But I think you’re forgetting something: even though QE is managed inflation on USD, the real economic capital (the pizza itself) does actually get bigger as people create things of value.
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:48:44
Because BTC is not a controlled environment. Governments hate decentralized private platforms of any kind because they lose the ability to enforce laws and collect taxes. Which is of course precisely what makes them so compelling to free thinking people.
Considering that BTC etc are taking a foothold in global commerce, I rather doubt central banks are just sitting back and waiting around. Imagine what hell would break loose if one day corporations start conducting serious business on decentralized and private platforms. You’d lose a host of public services because tax income deteriorates, etc.

deflation means you pay less for things, because the money is worth more.
That’s exactly my thought. Because it takes more effort to mine new coins, I think over time each coin must be worth more fiat currency since that’s the index. So it’s by design a deflationary currency against a fiat pair.

If you’re not a billionaire you’re just chump change.
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:11:23
The niche use case of unregulated decentralized exchanges makes sense for all tax-avoiding and otherwise illegal activities and I’m sure they will coexist just fine with regulated systems based on some globally standardized platform that can be taxed and audited. 
I’m surprised to hear you say Coinbase ranks low. Which ones you think rank high?
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:41:34
I’m Thursday

Everyone is so over the moon.
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:03:53
Which is making me think that banking professionals are setting up to treat BTC like Gold Bouillon without the hassle of storing a heavy metal.

Not that I have any clue but I wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin Suisse is in fact a Joint Venture funded by Credit Suisse with the express intent to establish an owned brand in the sector.

Same old same old. Greed. Fear. Sex.

There is a reason Jamie was loudly decrying crypto as silly and look at Chase now.

You have zero ability to audit their compliance for such requests. It’s like google claiming to delete your photos. They don’t. They just tag them as hidden. But their ML still has access and uses them for as long as it makes sense to their ML efforts.

If my dick doesn’t go up I might cut it off too.

Hahaha. Ah, the 90’s...

Twenty four words?
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:03:15
By then, the feds will have instituted enough laws to tax your BTC the same as USD.
