Feels fucking weird as hell to find this funny.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:40:43
LOL I told you motherfuckers. Look where we are now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:41:46
I told you so.

I'vee been watching Bitcoin's pattern of behavior since 2014. It continues to follow the pattern.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:16:26
Thank you for corraborating. It really isn't that hard to see if you've been watching the charts for a couple years now.
It may very well indeed cripple it but I think in the long run it will bounce back. There seems to always be a period of stagnation that makes it appear to be dead after a large crash. Its always found it's way back up though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:05:59
It's not hard.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:43:59
Did I not say I'd buy more? There's a big difference between knowing the nature of how it works and spreading FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:44:30
What's to say that we know how to replace these institutions adequately though? Don't get me wrong, Im not at all happy with the current state of things. I'm just concerned that we're jumping into this blindly without being equipped to face any potential problems that will arise.

@_date: 2017-12-12 04:29:17
I don't know.

@_date: 2017-12-12 05:13:49
It's just the truth. I'm not here to argue my point only share my intuition which is very well developed when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:28:35
I don't know, haven't done the TA.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:42:53
Don't know. A big one for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:41:48
How long have you been in crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:53:40
What is "a bit" to you?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:11:07
I don't know when it will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:05:26
Look at the charts and find the pattern asshat.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:16:59
How long have you been in crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:35:24
We should talk more about this. Wouldn't the trade volume be soaring too since people are buying it like never before? They're trading their dollars for Bitcoin. 
What am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:51:40
I think there are a lot of people who don't understand this very basic concept. That's why I posted it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:27:56
We're all fractals.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:50:53
It's really not.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:32:18
How long have you been watching the charts?

The fundamentally sui generis things about bitcoin are the facts that there is a slowing rate of finite bitcoins being mined and that the value is based on trust in the blockchain.
That being said, why wouldn't ignorant speculators buy into an asset that has a lot of hype around it in times of uncertainty regardless of whether or  not they understand the unique properties of said asset?
@_date: 2016-06-25 19:44:43
Because 48% of them thought it would be a bad idea and many are now stockpiling alternative assets like gold and silver. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:16:17
Bitcoin newb: "How do I mine?" 
smikketabito: "No."
@_date: 2016-06-25 19:24:06
I didn't necessarily buy into the fear mongering. Its the fact that fear mongering exists and can act as a driving force in the market that I'm basing my question on. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:46:52
The whales know exactly what they're doing...... maybe. I don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:44:18
I can recite my private key out loud from memory. The only other place that it exists is on a small 3"x 8" paper sealed away in a very safe place. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:41:36
Notice how the monopoly man has no monocle. You have now stepped into an alternate reality. 
Bitcoin is $6400 here. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:10:20
The mining process just goes more smoothly when it can spread out in a wide yet thin channel. 
@_date: 2016-05-27 17:32:55
I thought I was the only one. That's some real BS. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 00:47:13
I acknowledge this fatal blow to my idea and quietly retreat to sulk in the corner.. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 15:25:44
Hey pal, I'm planning a website for charitable giving through bitcoin as well...
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:29:49
TL;DR plus I don't care enough.
@_date: 2016-07-03 15:21:48
10 lol
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:30:54
Well it's a good thing I live in the states then.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:17:10
Or I could just set up autobuys on Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-05 08:06:47
Thank you people who sent me bitcoin &lt;3 
I realized that if someone wants to send an artist digital currency they should make sure that they only get the qr code from an original post or website. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:07:31
Yeah there's no way I'm going to be able to get all of my shitcoins off Polo lmao.
