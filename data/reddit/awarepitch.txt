In Wall Street terms, anything that moves very quickly and goes parabolic is overvalued. Fundamentally, we may see different reasons for it to have a high value, such as the very concept that it is based on, decentralized exchange of money, but technically, many of them looked at charts and shouted short short short!
What goes up must come down, that is the rule of any kind of asset. Bitcoin has to follow those rules as well (and has been quite consistently, if you check the fib levels). It will of course gain value again, but it's a matter of time.

Yeah but it's still probably better than Western Union or PayPal, isn't it? What would that work out to as a percentage? 
These fees are a bit high right now but there's a good chance they'll go down. If lightening is implemented properly it can be done. I think that there has to be some more scaling rolled out for it to be usable, but it has potential for sure. 
This wallet doesn't have anything to do with those dormant coins that just started moving around again, does it?

More stable under which terms exactly? They'd like to tame a wild beast but I don't think they can really wrap their hands around it.
Sure, large firms like Goldman are saying that they're going to get involved, but how does this actually help things? Institutional investment does not stabilize the price. Large market caps stabilize the price. When more money is in a market, it's harder to cause huge price fluctuations with ridiculous orders places at auspicious times.
What happened when futures where introduced last winter? Everyone and their uncle jumped on shorts (I would've too if I was paying attention) because it was obviously overvalued. Thanks Wall Street.
