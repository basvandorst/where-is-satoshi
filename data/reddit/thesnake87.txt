Fuck... guess I gotta load from my previous save again...
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:05:00
You know... I never thought of that...
@_date: 2014-07-02 03:05:39
Oh I do! haha I was just saying that as a joke. 
At least for me, it was usually faster to save, try and get 3 phrases, and if none of those work, just load the previous save instead of using the 4th try.
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:24:08
Never thought of that! I will look into it. Thank you for the lead :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:17:40
I mentioned you in my essay as to why bitcoins are leading to the future of money. Keep up the great work :) if I had the coin to tip you, I would right now.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:25:23
I was thinking like .2 a coin every couple of weeks. Money is slim for me because of school so I don't have a lot of disposable income. I'm writing a paper on why crypto is the future form of money though for school so I'm definitely emotionally into it, I just don't have a ton of cash.
@_date: 2013-09-26 22:39:23
True... Ill probably wait a month then give it up lol
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:29:51
Aaaaaaaand I sold at the wrong time...
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:14:06
I don't know why you got downvoted... you're absolutely right.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:39:38
So far so good! It's only 8 pages but I'm just working on the finishing touches of editing grammar and such. Its for my writing class, where we turn in 3 papers in a portfolio and that's what our grade is based on for the semester. One of them has to use sources, which is what I'm using the bitcoin paper to fulfill. 
I talked about how with the Outpost, you're able to get support from across the globe compared to being stuck with trying to get donations from within the region. I cited your thank you post, showing how all 22,000 up to the date have been entirely from bitcoin. It really fits well with how I'm trying to stress the global aspect of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-31 12:57:31
Can't wait to use this for my paper. Thanks!

Virwox. Trade BTC for Second Life Linden (SLL) then the SLL for Paypal. Yeah, there will be fees, but it's a pretty fast way of doing it.
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:12:21
I'm not asking like if someone tells me to I'll buy. I'm just asking for input. Obviously China drove it up huge while I was out. But I'm just wondering what the general consensus is in regards to everything.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:43:21
Ive done it twice already since I can use my Paypal on VirWox. Then after I exchange the SLL for BTC, I just send it to my cold storage address. Easy way to slowly build up without worrying about giving your bank account to websites.

I like your business proposal... I shall be in touch.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:19:08
There's apps now that take a screenshot and bypass notifying the sender. Just haven't tried any yet.
@_date: 2013-09-16 16:00:08
Hence why I am taking advantage of what I have right now. But I'm thinking about investing the some ASICMiners and a usb hub to running those instead. That way I can still game and I'll have a higher output.
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:29:48
I saved this thread for the exact same reason! Writing why crypto is the future of money here.
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:32:24
Darn... alright. Thanks for your input. Is CampBX a solid trading platform by any chance? It's listed on BitMinter's site and I only created an account, I haven't linked anything yet. But if BTC prices keep rising I may as well invest in a couple.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:24:20
Sweet! I just wondered, sounds good :)

Yeah after I posted this I went back to check and *facepalmed*
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:53:55
You... I like your style...

$35? I got mine two for $20 each and have 2 more coming!
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:19:13
Still can't view the topics...
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:40:58
I actually live in a college dorm so I'm not paying anything haha, that's why I thought I should take advantage of the opportunity since I won't be paying for my own electricity bill for the next 35+ weeks of school over the next two semesters.

I bought usb miners with cash on eBay, mined not even .1 of a coin. And after using calculators and with the difficulty hike I decided it was best to cover my losses.
I know I should have done more research beforehand, but I did not have bitcoins prior to mining.

Would love to give this a shot if anyone has a code
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:12:47
That was an awesome read. Branson is a brilliant man.
Only way to go is up!
Paging to and @_date: 2013-12-18 04:22:51
Sounds just like Immanuel Kant.
@_date: 2013-09-26 15:30:51
True. When I have all 4 of mine I may just thow them on the Bay as a rig and see if there's any interest.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:45:42
That was my plan!
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:10:09
@_date: 2013-10-31 18:33:50
I should have clarified, so my bad as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:49:55
Am I too late? :(
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:41:43
Yeah you're going to have to double check yourself though, I can't remember right now lol
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:37:06
Subway. After seeing the two restaurants start accepting btc and then their verified Twitter account retweeting a redditor and his medium.com article, I see them being a huge propellant of getting bitcoin mainstream.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:25:04
That too!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:49
Wait until you tell her tomorrow that btc hit $1000USD tonight (assuming it does)
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:27:38
Wow... and to think this is still only the beginning. WE'RE IN FOR THE LONGHAUL BOYS!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:24:17
Not a huge Gox person, but this site is one we've been really needing. Great for those new to bitcoins! They really did well.
@_date: 2013-10-03 01:45:28
Wait... then how is Frostwire still up?
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:59:32
To be honest not too bad. There's a daily limit of like $100 USD anyway, at least through using the PayPal option. I've spent $55 and maybe $6-7 was taken in total from PayPal, VirWox, and the bitcoin transaction fee. Thanks to the rise in value of bitcoin though, it's quite frankly irrelevant lol since I've already made my money back and then some. It's honestly perfect for small bitcoin purchases to slowly build up a savings.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:37:27
I'm actually doing one of my writing papers this semester on why Bitcoin is the future of money. Nice job!
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:17:41
So, I registered and confirmed my account a few hours ago, am I good to go?
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:25:26
Is it wrong that I read this in the Pillsburry Dough Boy voice?

On a stiiiiiiiiiick
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:14:49
I learned that mining wasn't profitable the hard way... granted I only bought 4 ASIC usb miners in August, I sold them not long after once the difficulty spiked and the value of BTC didn't go up. Unless you have a lot of disposable income, mining simply isn't worth it.
Had I kept my coins (err... fractions of a coin) I wouldn't be kicking myself as much as I do today lol, I love reading all of this :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:19:14
Will do man
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:44:43
Sweet! Ill put it up as a pdf and send you a link :)
