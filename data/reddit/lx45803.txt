Yes? The kind of people with dynamic IPs are typically residential customers, and residential customers don't typically run mailservers, so obviously any attempt to deliver mail to a dynamic IP will likely fail. Not sure what you're getting at.
^(Also, cloud hosting gets you a dynamic IP, but that's such a bad idea I'm not even going to address it.)


If you're the kind of person who runs their own mailserver (ie, a nutter), you're probably already aware of this and doing it anyway. The Spamhaus PBL already has an extensive list of dynamic IPs that shouldn't be sending mail, so you're blocked from the start. You'd either have to use an outgoing relay, or get the people you're sending email to to reconfigure their mailserver to be more permissive (good luck).
None of this is reasonable or a good idea, but it can be done.

Thanks for the chuckle, these threads are always pretty dry.

That's not a practical concern. The odds of whoever gets your old dynamic IP happening to 1. run a mailserver that 2. accepts mail for mailboxes it's not configured for, are ridiculously tiny. The vast majority of the time, the connection to your old IP would time out or be rejected, and the sending mailserver would just queue the message and try again in a few minutes.

'1/2000th as large', please. '2000 times smaller' just sounds weird and doesn't convey the information as clearly.

Huh, I've only ever seen screenshots of this page; thought it was just for mods. Thanks!
Wow, look at that spike. More than doubled our daily pageview record in a single day, and almost doubled our uniques. The newcomers must be curious.

That really doesn't seem to be related in any way, but I'm not complaining.
