Umm, boycotting a Bitcoin conference which provides a venue to a known scammer *is* accepting personal responsibility.  
You also seem to have confused "freedom of speech" with "right to speak at a private conference before paying attendees."

Then he will have much wisdom to ruminate on when and if it comes time for next year's conference.

There was some amount of money flowing from Josh Garza, a known scammer, to fund a conference organized by Moe Levin.
Is that more accurate?

It places you in the camp of the "gullible enough that any information I may have concerning bitcoins is terminally flawed," though.

No, exchanges are going to be bullied by economic forces.  If Bitcoin China is selling at $2k and controls 90%+ of the hashpower while Bitcoin UASF is selling at $20 and controls less than 1% of the hashpower, wanna take a guess at which of those will be recognized by exchanges as the Real Bitcoin and which will get written off as an Altcoin? 
Look, the Grand Wizard understands you have strong moral principles. He also understands you have weak hashpower.  And in the grand game of cryptocurrency hashpower will trump strong moral principles every time.  Your cyber-anarchist dream is as faded as the Grand Wizard's collection of Grateful Dead tie-dyes, and doesn't smell much better either.

So the chain with &lt;20% of the hashrate will be recognized by the markets as the real, upgraded Bitcoin while the chain which has &gt;80% of the hashrate will be consigned to oblivion as a mere altcoin.
To quote Morgan Freeman, "Good luck with that."

Which "community" are we talking about? The Reddit community can put its feet down and hold its breath until it turns blue.  If the exchanges decide that Bitcoin China is more viable than Bitcoin Reddit they will declare BTC China the winner and BTC Reddit an altcoin.  And given that Ethereum is trading at over $300 and Ethereum Classic at under $25, we have some idea of how much value the market places on strongly held ethical principles.  
Even if they don't implement Segwit 2x, a Bitcoin China chain with 80% of the hashing power would likely still be faster than a Bitcoin Reddit chain with 20% -- and it looks like they plan to implement 2x and make the whole question moot.  The Grand Wizard sees lots of reasons to be concerned about a Chinese takeover of Bitcoin: alas, he sees no good *economic* reasons to back a horse which is dead at the starting gate.  The Chinese have always been good about learning from history and this time they were the ones who showed up at the diplomatic table with gunboats.

And the Grand Wizard (the Greatest Mind the Darknet Has Ever Known^TM ) strongly suspects the fork which is accepted by 80%+ of the hashrate will be the one to which the market assigns the greatest value.

We agree that in the event of a fork exchanges will likely offer both coins.  The question is "which fork will be more valuable?"  If the miners implement Segwit 2x,, and right now that appears to be a done deal, then both the &gt;80% fork and the &lt;20% fork will have some version of Segregated Witness.  The main difference will be that the 80% chain processes transactions 4 times faster than the 20% chain, and if you don't think that will have an impact on the value the Grand Wizard has a bridge in Brooklyn and some Arizona oceanfront property you might want to invest in.   


/s/Once/If  
Again, you are assuming the Chinese mining pools won't implement some flavor of Segwit despite the fact that they are saying that they will.  And in any event it's not a question of what the Grand Wizard favors or what you favor: it is a question of what the market will favor.  In the event of a fork the chain with the biggest hashrate will be recognized as Bitcoin and the chain with less hashing power will be recognized as an altcoin.  That is not an ideal situation but you play the hand you are dealt, not the hand you feel very strongly you deserve.
