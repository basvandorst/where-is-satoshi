What software did you use to make this? Looks great :) ��

Ahh... that may make sense...
Like all of my deposits are 1$ deposits to my wallet, that affects it then is what your saying?
What about if I got a hardware wallet then? Could I withdraw to that and then send from there or would there still be high fees?
And also, I know I could be making a bad move selling but as I say, in 2 weeks time if btc holds ill buy in with even more, I just feel its about to drop

Yeah I already made a post about this but just can't work out why... someone said it may be because I've made lots of small deposits into my wallet but surely that shouldn't mean a 50$ withdraw fee or some BS...

I don't want to time anything exactly, I just wanna sell whilst we're in the 4200-4400$ kinda region so then if they drop back to 3000$ like some predict then I'm covered, I'll just re invest if the price stays at 4500$ for ages but I'd just rather cash out now, I feel that this 4500$ bubble is gonna burst

Ok this makes sense, I appreciate the explanation,
I'm happy to wait for a transaction, I'm not in any sort of rush. The issue I'm having is I want to invest in bitcoin, however I don't want to have to pay 50$ if I say, wanted to move my bitcoins from Blockchain to a bitcoin core wallet, or to bittrex or somewhere,
Blockchain warns me that low fees aren't recommended even if I try and set a fee of 10-20$ so I'm not sure where I stand... 
I'd happily pay 5$ and wait say, 2 weeks for the coins to transfer, but I don't want them to get stuck
I'm still new to actually transferring coins so it just seems rather complicated and expensive to me

Never said I'm not doing that... I'm simply trying to sell without paying an absurd 20$ fee

Just tried coinbase but they want ID and no paypal and stuff, just cba with all that stuff so ideally i want somewhere that pays paypal no ID

Ok that's understandable... however your saying it's not BS that it costs 50$ to send 44$ via this system?... 
I've been a fan of bitcoin until this, just seems pathetic really... think I'll just keep my money in a regular bank ty

I don't know what fees these are however it seems whatever address I try to send to it's wanting to charge 50$ to send
@_date: 2017-08-24 23:21:04
No, that's what it states as the fee however it will not let me send more than 44$ as you can see in the pic, I have 92$ balance... it's so fucked up... :/
