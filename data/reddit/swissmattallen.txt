Falcon are under new management since they announced their crypto-friendly plans a year ago. They no longer like to talk about their crypto status. 
They &amp; Swissquote &amp; a couple of other Swiss banks currently offer crypto investment services for institutional &amp; retail investors, but without accepting crypto on deposit.
Some banks offer standard business accounts for crypto/ICO companies but you have to pass some pretty stringent business tests first &amp; prove you have substantial operations in Switzerland.
What kind of proposal did you have for Falcon -as a company or an individual investor?

I think the tide may be turning. But this is Switzerland, so it will be a slow process. I personally doubt that any Swiss bank will offer banking services wholesale to the crypto industry this year. They will only provide accounts to those that pass stringent filters - as currently happens - but on a slightly larger scale. A creeping effect rather than a dam burst.

A handful of Swiss banks are providing standard banking services to a small number of crypto firms, but no Swiss bank accepts crypto deposits if that's what you mean. The likes of Falcon and Swissquote offer limited crypto services but keep it at arm's length by using crypto depository services of third parties like Bitcoin Suisse.

Swissquote is now the second regulated Swiss financial player to enter this space (watch this space)

You're right this is not the same bank. We now have two fully regulated Swiss financial insitutions formally entering the alt currency market.

The important thing here is that the Swiss financial regulator has given its blessing to Falcon Clients having bitcoins in their accounts. Other Banks have also been asking Finma for guidance.

Swiss Banking secrecy - the rocket fuel grade stuff that kept foreign tax investigators away from Swiss Banks under all circumstances - officially died at the begiining of this year (even earlier for US clients). There's no reason to think bad people using cryptos will get any extra help from the Swiss Banking system now. The real effort will be to get more banks to accept bitcoin deposits or even open normal cheque accounts for crypto traders. Swiss banks have been petrified of bitcoin up until now, fearing it will get them into even more trouble with the US. Perhaps this move will make them a bit happier.
