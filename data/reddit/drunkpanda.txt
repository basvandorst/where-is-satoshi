Looks good! Things seem to break for me when I rotate my phone screen (sony xperia xz premium) which I have to because my LCD is busted, like on wallet tab it kicks me from "watch address" when I'm trying to read the options to add my addresses

At least one sub lets you post freely without your opinions being deleted and you getting 86ed

What, the removal of dissenting opinions?

Oh I misunderstood you. They original comment said they were talking about changing it, not that they had changed it

Well you don't have to be a dick about it, are you really taking my little correction so personally?

Thank you for this, well argued. I'll continue to read and ask questions to see what's up with all this

ETH, litecoin, NEM, Waves, and I think SC all have fees, and those are just the ones I know about because I've traded in them

To offer part of another side of this (I'm a newbie, this is what I learned from asking about this on the other bitcoin sub [I don't want to be censored for linking it in case the nasty rumors about this sub's mods are accurate, forgive me bringing it up if this isn't OK!]), I've heard non-mining opponents to segwit argue that: 
* the immediate issue facing bitcoin right now is fees and transaction time, which segwit doesn't address (although I think a couple of folks said there'll be a potential small improvement as a secondary bonus effect). Forks and energy should be focused on addressing this issue directly. 
* segwit is designed to address the scaling issue. In the past increasing the block size was how this issue was dealt with, so they find it odd people want to avoid this tried and true fix. They recognize that it's not infinitely scalable but believe doing it again shouldn't have major short term effects, and it will buy time to find a more universally acceptable solution. 
* segwit is a major shift in technology, and the proposed coding is extremely (and allegedly unnecessarily) complex. They believe that there exists a more elegant and simple long term solution to the scaling problem that doesn't rely on unproven and convoluted technology. 
* something about the changes segwit brings will make bitcoin irrevocably deviate from the white paper and intended vision of the currency. I wasn't clear on exactly what, I should reread that part. 
This lacks nuance and potentially accuracy as I'm just regurgitating what I've learned as I understand it - I encourage anyone whose position I'm trying to present (anti-segwit non miners) to chime in and tweak what I wrote to more accurately represent their stance, or include any major points I'm leaving out.

Thanks for the well crafted response - I've personally found folks on this sub shouting accolades for bip148 like a cult with suspect justification, and folks on the other sub shitting on conflicting ideas without offering too many practical alternative solutions, but I've kept an open mind and taken everything everyone says with a grain of salt and read both. I'll check that video out soon and try to keep learning!

Trezor is a hardware wallet, the two main competitors are ledger nano S and keepkey. They store your private keys in a self contained USB powered computer, and can be used to sign transactions securely on a compromised computer. They're like paper wallets, but not one use. I guess you can think of them as warm storage. 
I got a trezor too. Keepkey looks like the best but they're never in stock. Nano S is good but I don't like the look of the interface, I like the trezor pin code system better, and it seems harder to lose and less likely to get stolen by someone who thinks it's a USB drive.

Do they have cameras though? Like real atms
