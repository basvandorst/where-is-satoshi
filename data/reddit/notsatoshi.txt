I might have been unclear in the post.
Let me clarify, what it does is that it extracts 32 random bits and uses the randomness from those to add to a byte array for each of the 128 calls to the function.
I don't know if this is safe but if it is 32 bits of randomness for one call then surely it should suffice to call it several times to add to the randomness. I am not sure about this however. Please clarify your point.

 - Maybe that interface suits you better.

 **It is totally safe**. I have reviewed their code.
They use 10 different security implementations. So it differs in a big way from brainwallet. The real "issue" was actually with bitcoinjs-lib.
They use the cryptographically safe function `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`.
On top of that they xor in the `new Date().getTime()` at a random place in the random bits array.
Then they use
`Crypto.SHA256(window.screen.height, window.screen.width, window.screen.colorDepth, window.screen.availHeight, window.screen.availWidth, window.screen.pixelDepth, date, timeZoneOffset, navigator.userAgent, all browser plugins, all mime types of the browser, cookies, language, browser history, browser url)`
to xor that in to the random bytes.

I don't agree with you. You say Brainwallet uses Math.random however you forget to mention how it works.
So let me explain it to you:
2048 random bits needs to be filled. 256 bytes. 
What it does is it uses the 32bit entropy of Math.random breaks it down to 16bits then 8 bits and puts them in an array. Math.random is called 128 times.
And then it adds the js date time object xored to the beginning of the array. 
Now if you are able to break that go ahead. You will be 100 million USD richer.

Well my friend it is open source free software. You are totally welcome to improve it.
If you are not happy with something you can always hire someone or donate to the team so that they can work towards your goal.

It's even digitally signed. But people who use TC aren't retardedly stupid to fall for this stuff.

So you basically wrote some kind of software that regenerated all possibilities of all "randomly" created keys in brainwallet from firefox?
Have you contacted the persons? My thoughts was mostly for people who used it to send and sign transactions.
