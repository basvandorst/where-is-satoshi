Congrats! I used some bitcoin &amp; other crypto to buy a house. Been buying crypto when it's low selling high for a while trying to catch the dips. I intend to replace all the bitcoins I used asap!

Short answer would be coinbase pro for an easy switch. I've used a bunch of exchanges &amp; wallets so it's good to experiment a little. DCA in &amp; HODL! 
Edit: Also don't use app. Fees were higher the last time I checked!

History repeats...

Thanks you bitcoin baller you!
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:36:26
Buy more when/if able at a good dip and HODL!
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:43:52
Possibly, but could go right back up to 5.3k+
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:35:12
Yep reup time

Thanks, if history repeats... This is what is happening now and onward!

Only Buy &amp; HODL!
Moon base, Space Station or Mars Colony?
There is also deep space exploration if you want your chance of an early death to be exponentially higher.

Last I checked a month ago or so...  the cashapp charges were higher per coin when buying with fiat than anywhere else. I'd rather pay a smaller fee and get more. Anyone have the % difference.

Buying dips and selling highs over the years has helped me build up. It's risky but no regrets. It's not time for that anymore. Just buying dips and gonna HODL on!

Can you show the time in between. After May 2015 up to March 2017?
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:42:53
The May 2015 to 2 year period x10 is what we are seeing right now. History repeats to an extent.

Higher fees &amp; even higher now plus you have to wait on active trader. The update really sucks.
