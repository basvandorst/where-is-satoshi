Focus on the section titled **Depositing from a U.S. Bank Account (Bank Wire)**
This explains it pretty well

After leaving office, he should totally have a live show that’s basically seeing what he can/can’t do with his tiny hands. I’d reluctantly watch!

I too got tired of this, so I started doing direct wire transfers from my bank to Coinbase Pro. It includes a transfer fee ($30 from bank/$10 from Coinbase Pro) but it shows up fairly quickly if you submit it before the cutoff time which I believe is 1p Pacific. When I submit it after that point, is still appears by around 6a Pacific the next morning.
Shitty ass fees for sure, but worth it imo in order to purchase at the price I want instead of waiting several days and risking a drastic price change.

I’ve never done it myself, but I bet it would likely be even slower than these estimates in your scenario. If it truly skyrockets in value, then there may be several more like you that will want to do the same thing. Wouldn’t that influx slow stuff down even more?

For real! That said, I actually keep about 5-10% of my investment on the exchange for this very reason, and have the rest on my nano s. I certainly don’t want to keep a significant amount on the exchange, but want to have some quick flexibility if needed.

Yup. In 5-6 years he’ll be talking about bitcoin as an everyday bum.

I’ve actually gotten ahold of a live person, though I wouldn’t describe it as pleasant. I had to call 4 or 5 times before I figured out _how_ to get a live person.
It took 45 minutes of waiting, but finally got someone. The person was friendly and seemed to want to help, but he was definitely talking In circles and didn’t understand the actual issue. After waiting 30 minutes with him on the line, I thought we were gonna figure it out. Unfortunately the call abruptly ended out of nowhere. Luckily he shared a small piece of info that got me thinking about the underlying issue, and I figured it out myself from there. Otherwise I would’ve been more pissed.
And forget those talking about entitlement. You’re absolutely correct. You have every right to expect to get a live person on the phone. Though I would lower my expectations in regards to a 5-minute resolution time. Hope you got it all squared away!

I think what he means is 35k in fiat and the other 65k in company shares (not BTC).
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:20:26
Complete guess here, but I would expect that your friend or that business would still need to have a bill of sale for the boat. That record would reflect that you paid in BTC, and therefore it’s a taxable event.
The initial move from an exchange to a hardware wallet is not a taxable event. Definitely not a tax advisor though...

Doubt your assessment is correct. My niece and several of her friends are big into coding and new technologies.

Yes this was a really good write up. I’m already familiar with all of this, but it’s good to see quality information being shared. It’s actually quite timely based on a post I shared earlier in the cryptocurrency sub: 
My main question was about how capital gains are impacted when you sell while holding both long-term (purchased 1+ years ago) and short-term (purchased &lt; than 1 year ago) coins. In particular, how the sell evaluates which coins are being sold and if they are long-term or short-term. The only comment suggested FIFO order (makes sense), but having a scenario like that might make this post even better.
Cheers regardless!

I actually didn’t take his comment as hostile at all. As was stated, ToS is the best place to go if you want to get a truly accurate answer. From your hypothetical situation, I’m not sure I’d want to bank my actions on the advice of Reddit users either. And if I really wanted to move that much money, I would indeed want a lawyer to read it over to make sure **I** was not taking an action based on my own misunderstanding.
He didn’t use hostile language nor was he being rude. It does seem like you are overreacting a bit here.

Yup! I mean, I still didn’t time it right and it went down a little more, but what do I care when I’m in it for the long run.

It’s not a contradiction at all. There’s varying levels of being “disconnected” from the money. Some feel no emotion at all (e.g. “it’s just money”). While some can imagine other things that could be done with said funds, but believe the risk is worth the reward. 
As long as you can accept any outcome and aren’t investing with funds you need to survive, then good for you!
I do agree with his assessment about limiting how often you watch the ride though (reminder in 6mo or 1yr). I look at it more often, but that’s because I’m certain I’m hodl’ng and I enjoy seeing what happens from one day to the next. If large swings can make you question your investment, then looking 6 mo. to 1 yr. from now is your best bet.
Regardless, welcome to the future!

For real! I’ve gotten to a point now of always looking at the associated news site. Not that I find all crypto-focused news sites to be wrong, but I’ll start believing the “mainstream” idea once I see more non-crypto sites posting.

I don’t have any knowledge on the topic, but your post makes me wish there was a trivago of cryptocurrency!
