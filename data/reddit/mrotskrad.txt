If you link a debit card, you can get 750 instantly, after verification.
If you link a checking account "today" you can get 7,500 worth in 7days at the price it was "today"

xpost this to I celebrated my (mostly)smoke free 10yr anniversary in July. I guarantee it will be the best decision you will ever make, its not simple, but it is sustainable.  
Just a tip - get an app that tracks your progress...quantified self is a seriously powerful motivator. The VERY best of luck :)
I'm realizing I can be talking about both bitcoin and stopping smoking.  Just go with it ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:33:00

I pulled the rest of my btc out of coinbase, into gdax into my wallet....20min later BOOM
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:30:48
I jumped in during the 6500 - 7000 dip through coinbase...this Saturday my bank account got hacked/drained.  It was my girlfriends birthday...I was pissed and upset. I called them up and they (BoA) basically gave me false promises of it being back in my account along with a replacement debit as of today.  No refud, no card at home.
Ive called fraud protection 3 times now, twice I was literally hung up on when trying to ask what was going on.  And each time, the recording stated they were receiving a higher than normal call volume....which didn't happen Saturday
Closed the account and opened one with a credit union which I should have done to begin with.  Im as done with banks as I was done with cable when I cut the cord almost 10yrs ago...done done done.
EDIT: To better word somethings.  
The account was drained by means of cloning a chipped card. I only do withdraws from 2 places, neither are sketchy, and I know what most card cloners look like.
The person used Credit as its method of withdrawal - twice for over $200. Plus 5 other $1 charges.  The gas station disputed the cancellation - so after the bank refunded my funds yesterday  - it took it back out again - then proceeded to get shitty with me on the phone as if I was the problem.....done done done done.

@_date: 2018-03-29 14:15:16
most accurate response, so far. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:31:46
BUY. THE. DIP.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:27:49
Yes.  i actually was.  And numerous other times.
By that time I had spent what I bought and the profits I made.  On every dip, I buy more, and I spend more later.  Im not a hoarder.  I actually use it at currency.
The one thing I dont do is sell during a dip, thats bitch made shit.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:30:11

people be crazy, yo
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:13:34
edit: sorry Im an ass, I was referring to the warrant that was released, and the agents explanation as to what happened.
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:58:40
100% agreed.  DEA/FDA/HLS dosent care about your $800 unless you give it to them ala undercover agent/comprised wallet
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:12:17
Is this message common with them?  Is there a more specific time to not get this message?
