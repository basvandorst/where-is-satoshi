Coin-swap stopped trading XPY??  Not last time I checked at   Just bought a few more XPY adding to the 736 BTC trade volume in last 24 hours.

Also on Vimeo and I rented it for $2.99 (but maybe because I'm based in South Africa its cheaper). Also if you put in discount code 'vigilante' (got it from the Dollar Vigilante show on YT) you get 20% off.

I'm not sure where you get your 18%/year figure from (except if you nitpick some non general situation and future moore law predictions not applicable today).  From Nielsen's and Moore's law I see a doubling every 2 years in bandwidth/cpu.  Buts lets not dwell on the figures - as you state the initial sync is the main problem.  Well if you feel that the extra time full node users have to wait for an initial sync is warranted to not introduce something like a 2MB + SW hardfork which would have had 95% consensus by now if introduced a year or two ago; but rather sit with this cluster f$ of split consensus right now I really don't know.  You surely cannot expect less contention with a claim that the current block size is too big?  I swear sometimes I think you are just a extremely clever altcoin holder who bought current performing alts at pennies and have a fortune to gain by breaking Bitcoin apart as value shifts to useable implementations.

Due to price performance exponential increase of technology this at least cannot be different from what the costs was to handle a 200kb/block average block size 3.5 years ago.
Space per GB per same price paid doubles every 14 months.  Do some quick calculations and you will see that its cheaper today to accommodate 1Mb blocks than it was to accommodate 200kb blocks in the past. It would cost the same to accommodate 1.6mb avg blocks today then 200 kb block 3.5 years ago.
Thus even if its true that users say this its not substantiated and smaller block sizes wont make a difference.

Totally unimpressed here as well.

If we fork it will only be when hashpower for core has dropped to 25% - otherwise a hardfork will not kick in.  I am not talking about forking on current miner support I'm saying hypothetically when we fork and at that time it will be something in the order of 25:75 Core:Unilimited.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:12:31
I get that but then Bitcoin is not purely pow consensus.  Rules changed by BU yes, majority hash followed (hypothetically), now its the new defined rules of Bitcoin - that is POW consensus as I understand it. 
For example ETH changed the rules and the majority hash followed and it was called ETH.  The original chain with minority hash become the alternative. (ETC)
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:53:07
But there needs to be a way to vote for changes in a decentralised way - which is what hashrate is all about.  A chain with majority hashrate but minority user support wont have value so hashrate is in a way connected to user support.
Even if what you say is correct it still stands then that Bitcoin is not pure POW consensus but more of a POW + what some people think users want which cannot be measured convoluted consensus.

I buy bitcoin on a regular basis and when I need to use my credit or debit card I found cex.io to be the cheapest (
From their limits page it also seems you dont need verification to buy BTC with credit card and withdraw it(
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:54:15
That does not make sense.  25% hash-power on difficulty X (which was calculated from 100% hash-power) = 40 min blocks on average till re-target.

How nice of them.  Now you can leave the Fiat system without going through the effort to close down your obsolete bank account.

Im not following.

Ye I saw thanks.
I think the bigger question here (as updated in the topic) is why Bitstamp and Bitcoinfees both miscalculated fee needed to get into the next block (which turned out to be 12).  Bitcoinfees estimated 0-3 blocks delay at time of sending and 1-5 just before confirming.
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:15:24
I for some reason always get a blockchain.info message of 'This transaction has none standard input' when sending from Bitstamp.  They confirmed this will not increase confirmation time on an earlier occasion.
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:21:39
Thing is I recently sent 0.0005 fees when the mempool was more than that.  Perhaps 'spam' transactions with lower fees is now replaced with more legit transaction with higher fees making it more difficult?  (Disclosure: I am not an expert on this stuff guessing)
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:19:50
I [asked]( the same thing a month ago and was told that I was being fed FUD on the fact that miners are not acting and that they just need time to upgrade.
@_date: 2017-01-20 06:25:01
To be fair I think 'those' people are rather against Core and SW as a soft-fork than just outright against SW.
@_date: 2016-06-22 08:40:02
Ye I see now that its a little low for current conditions.  This was sent from Bitstamp and will be my first confirmation issues I had sending from them.  Even bitcoinfees.21.co calculated my transaction should confirm within 3 blocks
@_date: 2016-12-14 07:40:42
You can relax this has nothing to do with FUD and I am not asking because anyone said something.  I would rather think this is a reasonable question from an objective standpoint.  Complicated to upgrade software ok noted thank you.  From your own comment a month ago and I quote: "We could have segwit active by christmas, though it's a bit unlikely miners will upgrade that fast."... you must admit that you were at least expecting more than 25% - and possible falling since yesterday - segwit signalling at this point.  I guess this question will get more relevant as time pass.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:00:50
Just a question but is the words 'spam' and 'attack' being thrown around here so often really appropriate for a decentralised network?  Anyone can use it as they please by paying a fee even if it's to undermine one groups interest for their personal gain.  There is not suppose to be a definition of misuse on a decentralised network not so?
@_date: 2016-12-19 05:38:01
 $7 per month for 500Gb.  Technology increases are (and have been) keeping up and even exceeding the block-size growth.  At least for me its now cheaper to run a node than what it was a few years ago.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:50:07
valid point... noted
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:52:11
Define "rush" - segwit code and implementation has been known for months.  Its not like waiting is going to change the state of the implementation.
@_date: 2016-12-02 06:47:20
Fair point... however I would recon paying for this chunk of resource puts in into a different category.
@_date: 2018-03-24 06:00:09
No you are not merely trusting. You can verify that a block has been solved at certain difficulty and included in the chain.  The same amount of resources (prohibitively expensive) is needed to fabricate and sustain false blocks to a light client than to a full node.  
SPV = Paypal!? Seriously now.

I had the same issue once when trying to deposit USD to Bistamp. 
There are many ways for FIAT to travel internationally but if it goes through Deutsche they reject cause they don't do bitcoin merchants.  I simply found a broker who used another intermediary bank (not Deutchebank OR Commerzbank) and deposits is going through fine.
You need to find a currency or bank account where Deutsche is not 1 of the middle men transferring fiat from Bitstamp to you.

What I don't understand about this comment (and I only had a quick Google so don't take my comments are confirmed facts yet) is that it seems that storage cost decrease by a factor of 10 every 5 years which is slightly better than the pace the blocksize is increasing?  This means that it is the same (or slightly cheaper) to store 1mb+ blocks now than in 2013 when the average blocks was 0.25mb (or thereabout) is it not?  I did not research but I assume the same would be true for bandwidth speeds?  In addition, raising the size to 2Mb does not mean the average blocksize doubles - it only allows growth past 1mb in line with price/performance of technology?
(Note: I end each sentence with a question mark because I am partly stating opinion, partly questioning)

ye I had the title wrong - should have stated why showing 16.66666666 minted coins :/
@_date: 2016-07-09 08:37:55
Ok but if we apply today's situation vs that in 2013 one can probably calculate that you can increase by a few Mb's  and be at least the same off today than before.  Prices not decreasing so much in future might then probably have an influence at the next increase but not now.  Speed seems to have had the same exponential growth than storage so the same reasoning would apply.  Thin blocks technologies might also overcome any foreseeable speed issues should the exponential growth in speed taper off.

Ye with blockchain.info's reputation I thought its something weird on their side.

I've ran a full node in Mozambique (mobile data is very cheap and fast there) and they are the poorest of countries.  
Not sure why you had problems in Vietnam I found the Internet fantastic and very affordable (from an South African's perspective in any case). I visited for a month.
