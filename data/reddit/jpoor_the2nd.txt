Gonna guess you don't even have a brokerage account lol.

None of that stuff trades off seasonal events lol. If it had edge people would enter trades earlier and earlier, thus erasing the edge.
The best you can do is surprise weather events but that is not time based.

Seasoned trader here. Anyone that tries to sell you a pattern based on time of the year / day of the week / moon phase etc is retarded.

lmao, because you are a fraud.

being a loan officer doesn't count. I'll make sure to tell renn tech all their fancy R&amp;D was pointless.
You gonna post some back testing results? I mean, why have energy traders if you can just short NG in march and long it in the late fall? 
Lmao, you're dumb.

did you bother to read any of those? The edge disappears when you try seasonal strategies. 
Giving you a chance to explain it rather than back out like a coward. If you try front-running, what happens when someone front-runs you?
Again, you've got no idea how trading works. You may push papers at a small branch office but you've never actually done any sort of quantitative analysis.

You're welcome to go back test your claims. That strategy is too simple to have edge and you're clearly retarded.
