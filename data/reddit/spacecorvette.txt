Yeah, 10K was considered the moon, wasn't it?
But it hits and everyone's like "ugh where's 100k already"

Agreed. But so it's not a good argument for people who do live in first-world countries. And if all bitcoin is useful for is a "store of value", it's useless for them. Not that I agree with this. I'm just getting annoyed by people parroting that phrase as if it's a magical spell that justifies everything.

If I was in OP's situation, I don't know how I'd react to recovering the money my brother committed suicide over losing

In a stable, first-world country, index funds and bonds are better at storing value than volatile and unregulated bitcoin. Or a savings account if the APY is at least inflation. 
What is "store of value" supposed to mean?

The key is to always remain first-order skeptical.

the gif of the business guy half-smiling at the end is a spicy old meme, can anyone get me the original? I'm prepared to pay 1 DOGE for it

Don't take my word for it, but the way it's going so far you might as well just buy now. It seems like if it's just going up. There are small dips, but every height so far has been eclipsed by later heights. If it's just going to continue to climb, you might as well buy now.
I assume no responsibility for loss of money if the price crashes!!

Don't care. Just investing every pay period. New ATHs follow every dip.

You wanna bet?

My theory is that people are hedging for S2X, so I would guess "no".
Nobody knows, of course.
