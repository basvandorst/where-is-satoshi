Friends don't let friends use Coinbase as a wallet, they are a bank.
My boilerplate is; You can use phone wallets for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use multi-signature with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( 
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:44:56
No, also problems there, it needs more time 
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:42:04
Yes, they track everything you do and report anything requested as a requirement of being regulated as a money service business.
If you want privacy, start using real wallets.
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use multisig with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-06-25 16:22:58
This. It's unusable full of bugs and amateur mistakes. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:32:06
Fuck! Every weekend morning, same shit. For pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use multi-signature with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( 
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:56:28
No way, they track you.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:02:47
Electrum is a great wallet, with a "c".
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:47:03
They don't even have crypto people, remember the RNG fiasco? What else will break?
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:16:21
Stop using this service, it's down all the time.
Use these alternatives:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
The later two work over tor.
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:01:45
I mentioned a few times, for pocket amounts use [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( are easy and for anything bigger amounts you must use multi-signature, both [Coinkite]( and [Electrum]( are great.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:44:31
If you are just looking for a wallet, don't use an Coinbase, you don't own bitcoin there. It's simply an IOU system, much like a common bank.
My boilerplate is; You can use phone wallets for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use multi-signature with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( 
@_date: 2015-06-03 18:09:03
If you are just looking for a good wallet. You can use phone wallets for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](

My Boilerplate:

Fuck! Every weekend morning is the same shit, two posts in a row. Someone is losing money with bad software. Stop what you are doing and for pocket amounts use [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use multi-signature with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( 
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:53:54
I can't believe people use this site. Just looking at the number of problems posted here every month should make people stay away. We should add to the sticky "Stay way from..."
Use these alternatives:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:00:58
Just make sure that for anything over what you can't lose you use multi-signature.
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:46:21
Sorry, it's not you, I'm frustrated because of all these untested software that gets advertised than people lose money.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:21:28
This is a project that I'd love to see more adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-25 12:35:19
It never gets old:
- for pocket amounts ~~[Mycelium]( (same bug)~~ or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use multisig with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:00:29
Worst fucking website ever made. Jesus, hire some professional people to rewrite everything.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:56:25
That's good, but when will you re-pay users for your screw up with their coins?
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:42:32
Cool and all but many conflicting issues and broken trust models to justify cost:
1. GSM, has basedband exposure (Can't keep real money in it)
2. 200 bucks (Too much for anything you can't keep real money in)
3. Multisig, but they can still take your money
4. Finger print security is a joke
5. Not open source yet, I don't know what you are doing
Other wise, fun product. Good luck on your endevour. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:47:50
Agree, I'm a user of both Breadwallet and Coinkite, not sure why they missed them or why you were downvoted.
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:58:41
Yes, it's essentially out of date information, spam and referral link reverting war.
Just point it to 
@_date: 2015-05-26 12:10:15
Here is my boilerplate:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:45:38
Thanks for the gold.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:39:34
My Boilerplate:
You don't own bitcoin on Coinbase nor have privacy.
Then you just need a good wallet:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
- you can buy things on amazon with [Purse]( and a coffee at starbucks with [Fold](
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:45:40
~~This is closed source, either use a open source app or~~ use a multisig and trustless service.
I was wrong app is open source, no need to angrily downvote.
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:08:25
Actually, I've been suggested the use of those 4 wallets because I think they are good and safe. Open or closed source has nothing to do with it. 
You can actually checksum coinkite's offline generator js, and you don't have to use it. Stop copying and pasting things 
My opinion is, if you are using multisig well you are safe. I generated my own keys and only upload my public keys, even if they wanted, they would not be able to get them.
I'd say you have an agenda, but looking at your history all is see is walls of text and a lot of conspiracy theory, you are hilarious.
**I've being advocating for Electrum and Mycelum long before** I tried Coinkite, are you going to call me a shill for that too?
I advocate to the wallets I both use and don't see reports of people losing money.
Stop with the drama and **bold** already, if people didn't agree with me my post would have gone to the bottom.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:49:15
The original client is fun, but don't use it. 
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:55:07
For sure, can't wait to eat their lunch, no pun intended.
@_date: 2015-05-20 21:02:21
I like this analogy, I will add to my boilerplate! 
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:50:30
Multibit is broken! 
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:26:14
Would you put your life's savings in it?
Not multi-signature and exposed to phones baseband.
@_date: 2015-05-22 19:21:03
Coinbase was not Goxed or Hacked, but here is my boilerplate:
You don't own bitcoin on Coinbase nor have privacy.
Then you just need a good wallet:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
- you can buy things on amazon with [Purse]( and a coffee at starbucks with [Fold](
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:51:56
Most web clients will remove it. You need to use some service like onename, coinkite, changetip to host the uri on a standard page you could link to.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:40:19
Remember to backup the seed before depositing any amount!
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:46:15
All this wallets I listed are incredibly easy to use. Please stop sending sheep to the wolf.
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:14:07
Don't take his word for it, just search around you will find posts.
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:18:10
Good phone wallets for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( and for anything bigger amounts use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:13:51
You might still be able to retroactively change, check with a lawyer. BSD might complicate it.
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:44:14
Please compartmentalize risk, follow this rule of thumb:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:36:40
Welcome to the club!
Now you just need a good wallet:

- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](

100 bits private

Don't take it personally but most of the options I see on the homepage are not ideal. You might want to curate it a bit, or people will lose money.
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:30:24
I think you are underestimating human error with phones and backups.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:38:20
For pocket amounts [Breadwallet]( is great.
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:36:00
Which is nothing for them, doesn't even cover the meeting snacks budget.
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:09:24
Neither have privacy. You don't own bitcoin on Coinbase.
Mycelium or Localbitcoin are better for buying bitcoin.
Then you just need a good wallet:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more use [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
- you can buy things on amazon with [Purse]( and a coffee at starbucks with [Fold](
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:35:27
That's a terrible list of wallets.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:49:19
Would you put your life savings in it? 
It think it's a great app, I use it. But for real money, you need multi-signature.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:42:17
While TCIP was getting developed and rolled out there were no amount of bullshit like this.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:59:52
You are free to move it. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:55:15
Either [Coinkite]( or [Electrum]( have my vote. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:41:27
Reason gets down voted there.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:28:25
I think you completely missed the point. Where do you think the value of the M1 supply comes from? 
No wonder all the conversation moved to twitter, who wants to argue with a dumb ass like yourself. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:33:42
There are other alts you know.
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:49:35
What's the link?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:14:56
The Brazilian Real (BRL) value is derived from the confidence on the economic output and secured by the violence capabilities of its government to collect taxes and secure it's sovereignty. This value is what makes their M1, so yes, it is a valid comparison.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:47:26
Not versus BTC, only versus US
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:32:52
Probably to make sure since there has not been any official statements form DCG
@_date: 2015-07-24 02:50:59
It's nice to see Bitcoin is helping you. For privacy and security use real wallets.
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more than you can lose, use multisig with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:14:55
Neat! Another great video.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:05:21
Because of  the blockchain crypto no one can go back with vintage future money and make a profit
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:05:36
Want to try it but it requires a Coinbase account, I'm not doing that.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:08:41
How are you keeping the Bitcoins secure?
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:53:24
I want to move there, whats the application like?
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:20:25
Thank you, this is exactly what you should be doing.
On a separate note: 
1. please make sure to make the foundation international
2. make all transactions public
3. make it very clear who is in the payroll of which company
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:31:44
Coinbase is a privacy sellout because they are a bank, and share the same investors as Palantir

@_date: 2015-09-22 21:17:56
Why should I use your product?
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:00:17
It's understandable, people want to know what they should choose. Bitcoin.org is a joke, look how they present the wallets. No feature by feature comparison.
@_date: 2015-04-15 04:17:12
I bet how much you want that your Team said that, but the CEO went around you and bought upvotes. The amounts were simply not possible for the ratio of subscribers and traffic.
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:32:01
ZapChain is a curated place where companies that don't care about privacy can go release their updates without being criticized. 
It's a joke.
@_date: 2015-04-27 13:53:45
Does it work with the original BTChip too? 
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:59:38
Paging this is a great idea.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:05:11
Nice updates
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:38:40
I want to like this, but most of the major names/projects/companies are taken by squatters (even EFF). This will never take off.
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:50:05
Alternatively you can use [Coinbase]( or [Coinkite](
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:18:38
I don't want to have to create a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:40:21
Nice, now you just need a real phone app too. As I mention before, Coinkite for  larger amounts and Mycelium for on the go spending.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:37:42
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:18:46
My picks:
- for pocket amounts [Mycelium]( or [Breadwallet]( 
- for anything more than you can't lose use multisig with [Coinkite]( or [Electrum](
@_date: 2015-10-23 04:10:16
Because it costs lots of money.

Stop using hosted 2FA, Authy is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:36:40
Because they don't want bitcoin to be Fungible. SegWit adds more privacy. If you work for the State you want bigger blocks.
