To which I explained that mobile devices are not simply communication devices and have a different use-case. They opened up a new software market, pure and simple. Whether some of those applications are overvalued are not is beside the point.

They're not personal communication devices. They're full-blown, pocket-sized computers that happen to have communication capabilities, and they're becoming as ubiquitous (if not more so) as desktop and laptop PCs. Look at it that way and it's no surprise that people are making a big deal about the software ecosystem for these devices.
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:34:11
Really? People said that websites were full-blown, pocket-sized computers? 
I don't see the relevance of your statement. Computers didn't go away after the dotcom burst. Mobile devices are becoming prevalent and there's a huge market for software tailored to them, because let's face it, people are using them primarily as computers, not communication devices. Is some of that software overhyped? Probably. But you can't pretend that the market doesn't exist or is just some passing fad.
As far as whatsapp (and instagram) goes, you have to understand that Facebook's goals are a little different. They're paying for users, not necessarily for the utility of the application.

Bitcoin and gold (and silver and other precious metals) are definitely complementary forms of currency. Bitcoin's only threat is to fiat, not to gold. As BTC gets stronger you'd see gold pegged to BTC rather than to dollars.
It's the dollar that has no value, not gold.

The consequences of nuclear when it goes wrong are far more far-reaching and damaging than coal will ever be (not that coal is any walk in the park, either). We've been pretty lucky so far, but I believe Fukushima is going to be a tipping point. It's a slow-motion Chernobyl times 3 (at least). The worst of Fukushima is yet to come. To claim that nuclear is clean and safe is an outright lie. For whatever reason people see the coal and oil companies as evil liars, but the nuclear industry as some shining beacon of good and truth. The energy industry is the energy industry, and it's all rotten and corrupt to its very core. Two sides of the same coin.
The coal vs nuclear argument is a false dichotomy anyway. We need to be looking into different sources of energy entirely. We also need to adjust our habits so that we consume less. There is lots of room for efficiency elsewhere as well. The power grid, for instance, is extremely lossy and wasteful. Transformers in most of our electronics and electrical systems are extremely inefficient. We're wasting tons and tons of energy in the process of transmitting and transforming it for use. I don't see why it isn't possible to reduce our power consumption by 50% just by being smarter about how we engineer our systems. We've only been using electricity for a hundred years or so, it's really still in its infancy (and unfortunately, no real strides have been made since we first learned how to harness it). There is a lot of room for improvement.

I agree and never stated otherwise, but what I think and what the federal government of the united states thinks are two separate things.
That's all beside the point anyway. My point is not about whether or not bitcoin can or should be regulated, but that the government is showing their typical response to a perceived threat, which is to attempt to police it into submission or eliminate it. They're scared because they're starting to realize that bitcoin has the potential to undermine their entire power structure.

Adoption has to be spurred somehow. Pretty much any market favors early adopters, that's just the way it works. You're rewarded for taking a risk that most people aren't willing to take. If no one took those risks, then bitcoin wouldn't be what it is today. Sorry that you're bummed that the "free money" days are coming to an end, but the validity of a currency shouldn't depend how wealthy you could have become by adopting the currency while it was still in its infancy.
I mean really, you're basically arguing that it's a *bad* thing that bitcoin is becoming valuable and that it's not a currency because of that fact.
@_date: 2013-10-04 01:10:00
The point is simple, yet utterly stupid and flawed. I understand *exactly* what you're getting at, but I will not allow you to manipulate the argument in such a way because it's completely disingenuous.
Yes, if there's a traffic jam then drivers are in part "responsible", but it's bullshit to delegate the blame to the drivers when there's the unnecessary roadblock being imposed upon them all in the first place when the traffic would otherwise flow freely and there would be no "responsibility" to speak of because there would be no problem to be "responsible" for.
Demand "is" part of the problem, but if-and-only-if that demand is coupled with prohibition. Prohibition is the problem. Not demand. Prohibition is the externality. Not demand. Demand on its own is harmless and I don't appreciate you insinuating otherwise.

Nature is fractal. Euclidean geometry does not describe fractals. On no scale is nature purely Euclidean. Euclidean geometry works only in abstractions created by man's misunderstanding of nature.


I think you might be confused about what Euclidean geometry is... You admit that nature does not create straight lines, yet you assert that any geometries that deal with things that aren't straight lines are irrelevant.

                     senators said in the letter. “However, we must also ensure that rash or uninformed actions don’t stifle a potentially valuable
                     technology.”


                     currencies they will miss the opportunity early on to control risks that these markets pose.


It's quite clear they're scared. They're very vague about the "risks" they're talking about. I don't think they're talking about risks bitcoiners face if bitcoin isn't regulated as they are implying, but the risks the government face if bitcoin isn't regulated.

If we can't make it work on this earth where conditions are perfect for us, then we do not stand a chance on another planet. The answer is not to consume endlessly with utter disregard and hope we can find more resources later, the answer is to learn how to live in harmony and balance with nature now. You say you are not selfish, but it is an incredibly selfish and arrogant attitude to think that the *entire universe* is yours to consume.
It is a moot point, however. Nature will force us to find balance or we will perish. We are at nature's whim, not the other way around. I assure you, your sci-fi fantasy of colonizing space is just that, a fantasy. It is wishful thinking and a way to rationalize our "collective mismanagement" of our resources. We cannot take what we have for granted.

The NSA designed the algorithm which is nothing more than an abstract mathematical description of the hashing process, not the actual software implementations (which is where any critical flaws would be likely to exist). The algorithm itself is currently considered to be quite strong and mathematically sound, and believe me, there are a lot of very smart people spending a lot of time trying to prove otherwise.
The government still has a vested interest in its own security. It doesn't make much sense for them to backdoor an algorithm that they themselves rely on.

Is striving for closed-loop not aggressively expanding? In order for the system to be closed-loop it requires everyone in the supply chain to adopt bitcoin, which by definition, would be expanding.
Or conversely, if we start seeing closed-loop bitcoin products, then that means bitcoin is expanding because more people are accepting bitcoin.
This is a good thing.

I wasn't denying that, but I could think of a few different ways of interpreting your statement. Absolute lack of trust between citizens and their governments perhaps ;).
Anyway, I suppose I wasn't clear when I meant distrust and paranoia combined with a statist regulate-through-coercion attitude. I don't think it's very accurate to draw parallels between a free-to-participate system engineered to be hardened against tampering and using fear as justification to forcefully impose behavioral conformity upon your fellow man.
I don't think it's hypocritical to advocate the use of an uncontrollable monetary system as well as the right for people to do with their money (or bodies or anything else) as they please.

Perhaps I should have made it more clear that I meant in conjunction with the internet. Bitcoin is more than a just decentralized currency, it is a decentralized currency network.
Additionally, according to the US government, gold is not a currency. It is a commodity. It doesn't coexist along with government as a currency.

I don't see how people don't understand how a distributed currency is the antithesis of the state. They are entirely different paradigms with the state being a monolithic, top-down centralized power structure, and bitcoin being a distributed, bottom-up system with the power being held by the users. They cannot and will not mix.
The days of centralized systems are over. We've moved past them technologically and evolutionarily. We are now in a new paradigm of existence and the concept of a centralized state is now antiquated and irrelevant, as are the ideas of political borders. We now have distributed communications (the internet), and distributed currency so now there's no need for a centralized authority to facilitate those systems. The tables are turning and the power is being returned to us though these distributed systems and any attempt of regulation is futile and amounts to nothing more than trying to cling on to an era that has since passed.
Stop living in the past, stop living in the state. This is our world.

People have different definitions of money. Go figure.
All of these arguments basically boil down to "I don't agree with this particular definition of money, therefore bitcoin must be a scam". But the fact of the matter is that to many people, bitcoin fits their definition of money and they use it as such. There's really no arguing with that.
Did the creators and early adopters make some bank? Most certainly. But ultimately, they produced something of value. If you want to call it a scam, then it's the most useful scam I've ever encountered -- and if that's the case, when does it stop being a "scam" and simply become "business"? Is it a scam for someone to start a company, create a valuable product that people want to use, and then sell off their shares?
Some people simply can't deal with abstract concepts, and with bitcoin being the abstract thing that it is, those people simply aren't going to "get it", and we'll continue to see weird arguments about how only "non-abstract" physical things can be "intrinsically" valuable.
