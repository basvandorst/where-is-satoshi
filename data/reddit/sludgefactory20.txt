Bitcoin has translation fees and if Bitcoin starts to push Visa out of the market Visa will just lower their rates.
Bitcoin fees are just going to go up with higher demand and less mineable Bitcoin.

Most investors don't really care what the fee rate is aslong as they are making money. But yeah you're right last resort stuff.
If you can use the lighting network to send Bitcoin, then you can use the lighting network technology to send U.S dollars. Block chain and lightening network have really good potential. In my opinion it's what gives Bitcoin it's value. However, other companies can use block chain and lightening network technology. I can see Visa embracing a new way to send U.S dollars if they are getting pushed out of market.

The block chain is what gives Bitcoin it's security. In theory the lightening network will work outside of the block chain but transactions become less secure. 
Visa averages 1.4-2.4% in transaction fees.  Right now Bitcoin is hovering around 8k. A business would lose 2% anyways if the price of Bitcoin fell 160 dollars in a day. Yes a business could make money if it goes up but it's not in a business' interest to gamble with their revenue they will want to exchange Bitcoin as soon as possible.
Block chain isn't going away with lightening transactions, it will just be used less. There will still be fees associated with Bitcoin especially for a business that needs to turn Bitcoin revenue into Fiat currency for operating expenses.

If you are poor you should not be investing half of your total holdings in a highly volatile investment.
