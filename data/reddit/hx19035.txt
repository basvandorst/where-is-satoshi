Yea Louis Ck had the best bit about being broke. 
On the topic of being overdrawn "I don't even have NO money. Even if it's free I still can't have it."

The only thing this poorly written piece is missing is the use of 'your' instead of 'you're'. Run on sentences piss me off... But the 'your' mistake makes me want to street-shit at lunch hour.

Is there a sub that describes what a node is and why it's necessary?

I didnt think about fingerprint security.  And I unlock my phone about 100x per day with my finger.

This will be interesting. Since millenials know nothing of hard work and dedication all of that wealth will be squandered on video games and designer coffee. And, to add insult to injury, they're not educated enough to realize that without any manufacturing a country eventually slides into 3rd world status.

A news article came out yesterday about some scammers hodling something like 10.1 million in BTC. Some people got arrested I believe.
Edit: PlusToken.  Google that and read up on it.

Eli5:. What exactly causes the fiat value of BTC to go up and down?  It's not a supply and demand thing right?
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:34:01
I know everyone says this, every day....but do you remember when BTC first came around?  I was way too cheap and suspicious to buy any.  With just a few hundred bucks I could have had 15-20btc.  Hindsight, amirite?

I'd wait till after the holidays to purchase. I'm guessing the price will drop a bit further allowing you to stack those sats a bit higher.  Just my opinion. But what do I know?  I finished second to last in my fantasy football league so my credit score is horrible.

Awesome scenario. Like everyone said, I wouldn't cash it out and crash everything. However, I'd trickle it down so that I wouldn't need to work anymore. I was emancipated at 15 just so I could work while in high school. Tired of it. Ready to retire early while my knees and hips are still factory.
