That's exactly it. Web wallets are great for storing small amounts if you want to make easy transactions. But even better, mobile wallets. 
Remember that these are unsafe for large amounts tho.

Great thanks, I've bookmarked this list for future reference. 
Feedback: nice theme and colors used on your page. In my opinion information is nicely organized and it's a good idea to have made distinct sections for buying with paypal, debit card, cash, and bank transfer. Also good job linking to bitcoin history &amp; evolution on wikipedia and the podcast at the end is something I'd listen to. Excellent work and very informative. 
As a constructive review: include more sites and list the deposit currencies, whether you can buy instantly, each exchange fee. For real beginners it would be best to have some youtube videos giving a presentation and introduction of each site and how to use it for buying bitcoin.

Good options there - it says that BitQuick is instant and takes under 3 hours to process orders. The site looks pretty user friendly too. But I saw that it work mainly in the USA with USD cash deposits, is this true? 
We are in the UK, so ideally a site to buy bitcoin with paypal or using a GBP denominated card would work better I'm assuming? LibertyX also seems to be US based. Do these sites work for customers buying btc from Europe, or anywhere abroad ?

That's true. I went ahead and found it [here]( Thank you.
It's quite a comprehensive list of sites, so this will provide lots of options. I especially like the way it is organized into sections for instant exchanges, for credit card, and many other payment methods are included. 
Though it would be good to have a description of all entries, and when appropriate, indications on how to buy bitcoin for each site in the list. Some sites seem to take longer to process transactions (deposits ?) than others. We need a service that works instantly for customers - any recommendations from that list?

That's a nice list explaining how to buy bitcoin with paypal. Will definitely check those sites out since that is our preferred payment option.

Hi, cheers. I looked up circle. It's an impressive site, but the home page mentions a 'pay app' to send money to friends. And there is no word of bitcoin or being able to buy it. Am I on the correct site? Do i have to link my bank card before I see the option to purchase btc, and am I able to send it elsewhere after?

Please see my other reply to the comment recommending this option

Great for beginners: Anycoindirect looks like a simple site to use :) I really like that it's based in Europe (the netherlands), as we are in the UK. I opened a live chat session to explain my situation and ask how to purchase btc using their service. The agent responded pretty quickly and I got all the information that we need. They have many payment methods, such as SEPA transfer, EPS, giropay, sofort. And it's also possible to buy with other currencies than euro which is great in our case.

My pleasure! Just remember to be realistic about your storage strategy. Never keep all your coins online, but don't either make it too inconvenient by only using a cold storage wallet. Good luck and welcome to bitcoin :) 
Andreas is indeed really interesting and inspiriing to listen to. Check out the LetsTalkBitcoin podcast too

It's a good question. As a recent bitcoin enthusiast, I also had the same confusion when researching how to store my bitcoins safely. There is a really great wiki for [how to choose a bitcoin wallet]( with the differences between cold vs hot storage and online vs offline wallets. 
Briefly summarized, here is how to choose a good bitcoin wallet and the differences between each type:
- **Web wallets** - there are websites or browser extensions that are super convenient and easy to use for storing small amounts. Some people also use the term "online wallet" when referring to a web wallet. Web wallets are considered unsafe, so I never store more than I'm prepared to loose on these. Again, **never store all your bitcoin on a web wallet** (exchanges are considered to be web wallets). Some good web-wallets: Blockchain.info, Greenaddress, &amp; Coinbase.  
- **Mobile Wallets** - these are great for making quick and easy payments on the go. You can use the QR code scanning ability of your smartphone to easily pay merchants and friends. These are also considered unsafe, so the same precautions as above apply. Some good mobile wallets: Breadwallet, Mycelium, AirBitz, &amp; GreenBits.  
- **Desktop Wallets** - Far safer then the above wallet types. Slightly less convenient, as you'll need to bot up your PC every time you want to make a transaction. Providing you are comfortable assuring your own desktop's security, these can be a great way to store a certain amount of your portfolio. Some good desktop wallets: Electrum, Multibit, &amp; Armory (very secure, but advanced users only).
- **Hardware wallets** - there are a very popular method to safely store your bitcoins. Hardware wallets keep your private keys away from hackers. Some people refer to this type of storage solution as an "offline wallet". They do however need to connect to make transactions. All the same, this is currently the best compromise between safety and convenience. Some good hardware wallets: Ledger Nano, &amp; Trezor.
- **Paper Wallets** - these are actual pieces of paper where you'll print out your private keys. A paper wallet is considered to be a strictly "offline wallet" and/or pure "cold storage". You'll need a paper wallet creator (software) to do this. Once printed out, people generally secure their paper wallets in a safe at home or at the bank. The inconvenience is that you'll need to recreate your paper wallet each time you make a transaction. Bitaddress is a good paper wallet creator.
The difference between **hot vs cold storage** is that hot storage solutions expose your keys online, while cold storage solutions never allow your private keys to be in any way "loaded" online. Some people make the same distinction between **online vs offline** wallets. Pure cold storage wallets (such as Armory) will sign your transactions totally offline, and you then broadcast the transaction using an online machine. 
I like [this video]( of Andreas Antonopoulos talking about his personal wallet configurations.
