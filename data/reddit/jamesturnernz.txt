I have been involved in a business where we had a persistent fraudster. They would buy the product online then we were pretty sure they would resell on eBay for a good discount. They were using stolen credit card details but always shipping to a similar area in Florida. Once we cottoned on to the scam we canceled and refunded before shipping and reported the attempts to the Florida fraud department. But yeah it was a pretty long con to try and turn the credit into cash but it must have been working for them in general.

Do you mean people learning to hold their own keys and using decentralised exchanges?  These services are getting better everyday.

Thanks for the book recommend. Will check it out.  
At first in 2014 the numbers seemed like a big joke.  It the more I learn about the potential value based on other forms of value like gold and property. The more I realise those numbers are just a matter of time with no major surprises derailing it.

Yeah. There are lots of guesses in the thread but this is the one that has some good thought behind it. Plan B talks of the stock to flow ratio and the coming halfening. 
And they talk about market values and caps. Like gold and property. Knowing what the global market values are for these things and comparing them to the current and potential future value of bitcoin are some very sound references to use. 
I would HODL. And read

Yeah I agree. I wonder if a lot of it is speculation. But that doesn’t always make sense either and so I wonder about manipulation. But sometimes that doesn’t always make full sense either. I do wonder about how many people with a lot of resources are in the game and keeping a low profile.  I’m enjoying the ride.

What are their trade fees?  Don't like the lack of transparency without signing up.
