The current rate on the ATM as of 8:32PM HKT is 5236HKD per Bitcoin. We don't charge any fees however there is some margins built into the exchange rate which is not a straightforward calculation as X + % profit. For reference BitStamp 647.86 USD, BTCChina is 3895 RMB, and ANX is 5060HKD to give you an idea on what the "market price" is.

Hey Spats,
Correct.  If you are already registered with ANX, the Bitcoin purchase is credited to your account.   If you do not already have an account, an account is created and the Bitcoin purchase is then credited to your account.  There is nothing preventing you from withdrawing the BTC to your own wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:20:49
We may consider this.  For now, we're concentrating on making the purchase (only) of BTC as smooth and efficient as possible.

Hey again conchoso, 
Sure that is something we could certainly consider mandating, however to be clear, there is nothing preventing the bitcoin charting sites doing this today.  Our API supports already supports that.
To be (somewhat brutally) honest, it has proven very difficult to date to explain to some of the charting websites how a blended, multi-currency exchange operates.  I'll further discuss with our development team and our CTO.  
As per previously, cheers for taking the time to comment again.

Errrm, we're based in Hong Kong, not China.  And for the record, we impose a KYC policy to assist in maintaining our worldwide banking relationships.

The ANX debit card is in no way associated with your private keys.  Upon your choosing to do so, you can fund a debit card using the available balance from your ANX account, including the ability to exchange bitcoins for fiat currency on the ANX debit card, allowing you to use the debit card in any retail, merchant, or ATM where VisaCard is accepted.

I have spoken to our CEO and indeed the topic wasn't about specifically transaction malleability and more on the fact that Bitcoins is constantly under "hacker" attack.  He could have just defended this particular attack wasn't a security attack, but what he wanted to get across to Bernie was that any type of attack is quite common on the internet and it's not just Bitcoin companies that are targeted.  All companies on the internet are susceptible to cyber attacks and that's why security controls and processes are so important.  Security tools are constantly improving and will limit the effects of future attacks.   
Chris Hitchens is a master debater!  Will definitely pass that on.

Hi Yeh-nah-yeh,
ANXBTC is primarily aimed first time Bitcoin buyers, dealing in a single currency.
ANXPRO focuses on more advanced trading with support for Altcoins and multi-currency trading.  The platform will mature with advanced analytics, charting and algos, among other features.
Both sites rely on the same single order book.  The order book is a true, blended multi-currency order book meaning regardless of what fiat currency you submit your orders, you can actually cross with orders submitted in an alternate fiat currency.  I don't know of any other Bitcoin exchange that achieves this today.

Hi Jimmy,
We receive such inquiries on a regular basis.  We're doing everything in our control to guarantee the longevity of our business.  Whilst Bitcoin is not regulated in Hong Kong (like most regions of the world) we are no less still dealing in fiat currencies.  We are required to verify both the identity and address of any customer dealing in fiat currencies (regardless of whether you are using our ATM in Hong Kong or trading on our exchange platforms).  
We were one of the first exchanges in the world to insist on KYC and AML polices.  And even though a small minority believe this is absurd and not required, the reality is that we have implemented these measures to be as regulator-compliant as possible and also ahead of the curve when this becomes mandatory.
The monetary authority of Singapore only yesterday announted that they would regulate virtual currency intermediaries for Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Risks.  You can verify this claim here:

Hi swordfish, we accept AUD deposits and withdrawals via local bank transfer (i.e. internet banking).
Note CoinJar is not an exchange.  They stipulate the price much in the same manner that Coinbase do.
ANXPRO is our exchange offering, whereas ANXBTC is our more simplified interface.  One ANX account will allow you to seamlessly switch between the two interfaces.
We regularly compare our exchange prices to the leading venues in Australia and in almost every comparison performed, we are the cheapest to purchase BTC from in AUD.

As per our support email, we're still awaiting for a **VALID** bitcoin address.  Both the addresses you list above are invalid.
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:53:00
Please allow me to explain.
Take everything you know about exchange order engines and forget it - ANX is completely different, from every exchange on the planet.
Other exchanges have separate order books - one order book for BTCEUR, another for BTCUSD. Trades, pricing, depth is all independent.
ANX on the other hand has a sophisticated engine that streams in FX rates in real-time, and blends all FIAT currencies into a single order book.
Orders placed in BTCEUR can match against orders placed in BTCUSD. It's based on a very fair algorithm that converts each existing order into the equivalent price for any incoming order.
USD orders are settled in USD, and EUR in EUR.
Some exchanges have attempted to implement a multi-currency offering by first converting orders into a common currency, which is terrible for the customer as they suffer FX slippage.
In the case of ANX a USD order rests in USD, and a EUR in EUR. If they match, both parties receive their native currency.
So - when charting sites utilize the two API calls as per your email, you are actually querying against a single order book.
The data is completely transparent - the "primary" flat tells you what is going on.
If a EUR trade matches against a USD trade, the USD and EUR will both be reported in the history call with primary="true".
The volume may appear identical in each of the 11 fiat currencies we support but that is because it is identical; transaction volume could have been executed in any of those 11 fiat currencies we support.  We're the only exchange in the world that offers its customers to execute in their local currency of choice (provided it is one of the 11 currencies we do today).  Customers no longer have to endure poor bank exchange rates and in many cases, they no longer have to rely on expensive wire fees (we now support local banking in Australia, Hong Kong and in Europe...and adding additional payment options every month).
I hope that explains.  Happy to answer any questions. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:24:52

For the record, we've assisted the customer from the moment the issue has occurred and continue to do so.  We're waiting for the customer to advise of the correct bitcoin address.  I feel your comments are unjust, however you're certainly entitled to an opinion.

If you're still reluctant to deal with us why not visit our office and meet the same staff whom have responded to your email and tweet.  Would be great to meet you in person.

Roger Ver just commented on ANX an hour ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 00:34:16
Hi, ANX here.  While the Xapos is a great card, we offer a different type of debit card and service where our users do not have to trust us with their bitcoins.  Once we have issued you the ANX Bitcoin debit card.  You can send the bitcoins to top up the card from your blockchain account or your personal wallet.  The way it works is we have a unique bitcoin address associated with your ANX Bitcoin debit card and whenever you send bitcoins to that address, we will automatically convert and load your debit card.  This is all seamless.  This top up can be scheduled or sent ad hoc.  We have been shipping our cards for a while now and the feedback has been positive.  Check out  for more information.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:49:58
Errrm, the card can be used at any ATM, POS or Merchant where Visa is accepted.  We are not a card issuer.  We simply distribute the cards and provide facilities to load the card with Bitcoins that are converted to USD.
Sorry to disappoint you. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:37:19
This is just the first step, we will be innovating and improving as things progress.  Stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:26:11
Thanks for the post!  We're back in stock and they're now shipping daily! 
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:47:23
Hi again, appreciate the further comments.
We take a very strong stance on AML/KYC owing to regulatory compliance.  We're doing what we can to instill trust and ensure our longevity within the Bitcoin community.  I fully appreciate the inconvenience of account verification however once complete, fiat deposits are processed intraday (mon-fri) and withdrawals processed once per day (mon-fri).  
Verifications are almost always processed within 24 hours of receipt.
If there's anything I can help with, please do let me know. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:18:38
SEPA went live today! We now support Euro deposits and withdrawals for all our European customers.  Zero deposit fees and only €0.90 to withdrawal.  
Enjoy. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:47:50
Sure disgust or not, it's entirely up to the bitcoin charting websites to display and interpret the data.  Our API provides the functionality to  display all our supported currencies either in singular or combined values.  We also work with them or enhance our API depending on the functionality required and how they choose to display the data.
We're effectively being criticized for offering our customers the advantage of local banking, reduced wires (and associated fees), much more efficient payment processing, not to mention the terrible FX rates relied on when bitcoin buyers/sellers have to rely their bank to first exchange to EUR or USD before depositing to a bitcoin exchange. 
The other reality is that we support 11 major currencies in a single order book (i.e. the only exchange in the world that achieves this), Sooooo, an ANX customer **could** have filled the entire daily volume in their native and preferred currency.
We pride ourselves on being very open and transparent; this isn't the way "we report volumes", it's the manner in which some bitcoin charting sites choose to report our volumes.
Thanks for the feedback whitslack.  :)

Hi Macro, 
Correct, there will be a small premium for the convenience of buying Bitcoins in person and to assist in covering the costs of having a retail shop front.    
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:46:41
Hi Macro, it would be great to see you there.  Perhaps a later afternoon lunch break is in order! ;) 
Our in-store Bitcoin prices will be determined by current market rates.  Customers will be provided a quote that they can choose to accept within a given timeframe to secure the price. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:46:13
Yes we are aware of the how it might have sounded, but this is 2014 and it fit into the $10 nicely.  Some people might not like that number, but most people don't say no to free money no matter what the denomination. :D :D :D
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:07:59
Thanks for the feedback Adog.  We're trying our hardest to have a product in our customers hands as possible.  Our daily volume is between 1000 and 3000 bitcoins per day and steadily growing.

Hi xygo, thanks for the feedback.
I'll raise these to our management team to see what can be done. 
It's worth noting that our customers can immediately withdrawal their crypto once purchased.  In 99% of cases, this is processed automatically and instantly. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:16:31
Thanks Cosby, we're trying our hardest to offer easier methods to spend bitcoins.  As much as we're encouraging the adoption of direct spending of bitcoins, the reality is that there are still too many places where you can not do this.  Allowing our customers to charge a debit card via bitcoins is not as great as sending them directly but we believe it's a pretty good alternative. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:33:45
This site is legit.  Our marketing campaigns are run off this service.   Cautioning on the bad side is always a good thing.  We will be making official announcements on our Twitter, Facebook, and ANXPRO.COM and ANXBTC.COM tomorrow.  Stay tuned!

Hey dskloet, 
We've been around since June 2013 and were one of the first bitcoin exchanges to be afforded with a Money Services Operator license.
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:52:48
Correct, there's nothing preventing you from sending a wire, except for the following:
* they're slow
* they're expensive
* you need to rely on the exchange rate provided by the bank
* if you want your fiat back at some point, the same applies above, including the conversion back to your local currency.

Hong Kong's first Bitcoin ATM is here! This Bitcoin ATM is as simple as a vending machine and is an extremely easy way to turn cash into Bitcoin.  The process of converting cash to Bitcoin takes only 15 seconds!  For those of you who are in Hong Kong, we would like to invite you to come and celebrate the launch of our Bitcoin ATM on Friday March 14 from 9am to 6pm at [ANX]( Wanchai headquarters.
Customers must first be verified to use this ATM (you can do that in our office) and will be required to use their Bitcoin wallet QR code.  The verification process will require government issued ID and proof of address not older than 3 months. The minimum deposit is HKD 10. 
The ANX Headquarters are located at: Unit 701, 7/F, The Sun's Group Centre, 200 Gloucester Road, Wanchai, Hong Kong.
We cant wait to meet you in person!

Hi guys (and gals),
We support ZipZap for GBP deposits (in the UK) and USD deposits in Brazil.  You can select this option from the deposit journey on either of those currencies within ANXBTC and ANXPRO.
As ZipZap requires a physical bricks and mortar location to deposit funds, you will not be able to deposit GBP whilst located in Asia.
Please do let us know if this requires any further clarification.
@_date: 2014-01-30 10:53:49
[ANXBTC]( and [ANXPRO]( now offer local Australian banking.  
We process fiat deposits and withdrawals same day (Mon-Fri) and we're the only exchange in the world that maintains orders in no less than 10 fiat currencies in a single order book.  Our PRO product now also offers Altcoins with more being added every week.
We've had a large number of Australians register with us since we introduced local banking a fortnight ago.  We regularly check and can say with confidence that we're usually the cheapest avenue to buy Bitcoins with AUD.

@_date: 2014-07-10 15:04:33
Hey sumBTC, you add funds from your available account balance from your ANX account.  There are no credit facilities on the card thus you can not spend more than you load.  If you lose the card, you would need to be issued another and we would transfer the balance from your original card to your new card. The card is protected by a PIN, much in the same way that bank issued debit cards are.
@_date: 2014-02-05 03:49:20
would be interesting to sponsor talented artists by using BTC! Hope they will roll out concrete plans soon.

All fair points nofeihua.
We're currently undergoing a new UI which will include much more detailed and revealing information.  It is not our intentions to conceal any identities, though I can appreciate the apprehension provided the historic pitfalls of some Bitcoin exchanges.  
We do regularly have our customers visit our offices in Hong Kong and I invite anyone to do the same and arrange this by emailing our support team.
Hopefully you'll feel the new UI update being delivered in the next fortnight provides you with more assurance that we're here legitimately.

Hey conchoso, thanks also for taking the time to comment.  Did you see my response above to whitslack?  Does this address some of your points?  if tldr: "it's entirely up to the bitcoin charting websites to display and interpret the data. Our API provides the functionality to display all our supported currencies either in singular or combined values. We also work with them or enhance our API depending on the functionality required and how they choose to display the data."
Nice suggestion with respect to only printing trades in one or two currencies, but then what one or two currencies should we decide to print?  USD and EUR I'm presuming as they are the biggest markets?  This then disadvantages all our customers whom don't rely on EUR and USD (which unsurprisingly make up the majority of our customers).
It is not our intention at all to either mislead anyone, however I acknowledge your comments (as well as similar ones here in this thread).
Thank you
@_date: 2014-02-05 12:09:03
We have purchased our ATMs.  They arrive this month.  We will make sure they're added to the directory. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:31:48
Sure, but hopefully it's a step in the right direction?  Innovation starts somewhere.   
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:40:15
The current rate on the ATM as of 8:32PM HKT is 5236HKD per Bitcoin. We don't charge any fees however there is some margins built into the exchange rate which is not a straightforward calculation as X + % profit. For reference BitStamp 647.86 USD, BTCChina is 3895 RMB, and ANX is 5060HKD to give you an idea on what the "market price" is.

Hi Nanoakron, point taken.  If he could have done it again, he would have reiterated that no funds can be stolen as it's not a technical hack, it's just another way to use social engineering to ask for the refund.  From what I understand, the CNBC interview was unrehearsed and he wasn't given the questions or topics ahead of time.  Most of the interview he was just deflecting the skeptism in Bitcoins and the market sentiment.  
@_date: 2014-02-05 07:03:16


They also charge a 0.1% deposit fee to process your deposit, with minimum fee of $15.  So you've lost at least $45 in fees before you've submitted your first order.  Some might be of the opinion that's not expensive, others might say it is.  That's the great thing about competition.

Bitcoin debit card is a stop-gap solution till the day all merchants and retailers are accepting bitcoins and everything can be interchanged through radio waves.  Today this is just one step into helping the adoption of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:04:45
Hey Andre, this has been discussed many times but more than happy to discuss it again here today.
Take everything you know about exchange order engines and forget it - ANX is completely different, from every exchange on the planet.
Other exchanges have separate order books - one order book for BTCEUR, another for BTCUSD. Trades, pricing, depth is all independent.
ANX on the other hand has a sophisticated engine that streams in FX rates in real-time, and blends all FIAT currencies into a single order book.
Orders placed in BTCEUR can match against orders placed in BTCUSD. It's based on a very fair algorithm that converts each existing order into the equivalent price for any incoming order.
USD orders are settled in USD, and EUR in EUR.
Some exchanges have attempted to implement a multi-currency offering by first converting orders into a common currency, which is terrible for the customer as they suffer FX slippage.
In the case of ANX a USD order rests in USD, and a EUR in EUR. If they match, both parties receive their native currency.  
The data is completely transparent - and if using our API,  the "primary" flat tells you what is going on.  
If a EUR trade matches against a USD trade, the USD and EUR will both be reported in the history call with primary="true".  We've even implemented additional functionality in the API to assist the bitcoin charting sites however it's up to them how they implement and display the various fiat currencies we support.
The volume may appear identical in each of the 11 fiat currencies we support but that is because it is identical; transaction volume could have been executed in any of those 11 fiat currencies we support.  We're the only exchange in the world that offers its customers to execute in their local currency of choice (provided it is one of the 11 currencies we do today).  Customers no longer have to endure poor bank exchange rates and in many cases, they no longer have to rely on expensive wire fees (we now support local banking in Australia, China, Hong Kong and in Europe...with more on the way).
[ANX](  
@_date: 2014-07-10 23:47:40
Correct.  We are working on improving the model so the conversion occurs at the time of the transaction.  We're well aware of the advantage of only converting at the time of transaction however this is the interim solution. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:29:11
Hey Felix, 
We're looking at other regions with intentions of supporting local bank transfers also.  We will announce these via our home page and also via email to our registered customers.

The lack of service and on-going issues with MtGox has created opportunities for other exchanges to compete.  At Asia Nexgen we offer a multi-currency order book, weekday-daily processing of withdrawals and deposits (of which we support bank wires) and our API is about to be released.  If people want better service I urge them to open an account with us.
@_date: 2013-08-25 11:12:48
The more you spend Bitcoins on goods and servers, the more you influence Bitcoin being more widely adopted.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 10:02:16
Shameless plug to say that [Asia Nexgen]( supports CNY, HKD, USD currencies and international user registrations including those from mainland China and the United States.  We also hold an MSO license from the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department. 
We offer a range of payment methods including Alipay, Tenpay and of course everyone's favourite, the international wire (including USD).
Liquidity may appear low however what is surprising (or more likely not!) is the surge in buyers once sell orders are placed on the order book.  There are definitely arbitrage opportunities available!
