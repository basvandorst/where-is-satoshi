Yeah, you don't have to open a channel with *each* person you transact with.  So long as there is a connected path of channels between you and the recipient, you can transact with anyone on LN with only a single channel.

It's not really all that hard.  A malleability fix isn't that hard if you're not trying to avoid Hard Forks, and there are already several proposal for this.  The LN code would not be all that different, either, it would just need to be retrofitted to encode the base-layer transactions differently.


The main one is that there's very good reasons to maintain low fees on the base-layer even once LN is fully implemented.  LN's security model depends on fees of the base layer being affordable.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:10:36
It depends on the nature of the bug.  If the client software computes an on-chain address incorrectly, funds can be rendered unrecoverable.  I saw an bug report on LN's issue tracker the other day that seemed that it might be of this type (was found on testnet).  I suspect that this kind of error would be a minority of "fund-losing" bugs, however, meaning that most "lost" funds may be "recoverable", if all secrets are logged.  Dumping keys and scripts into the log file makes it more likely that the keys will be stolen, but might be an acceptable risk for software that's still in "alpha."

Nodes are constantly sharing their blocks with each other: that's how the nodes get their "chain" to begin with.  It doesn't matter if it gets its block directly from a miner or another node.  It receives blocks from other nodes and validates them, and adds them to the chain as appropriate.  If it discovers valid blocks that form a longer chain than the one its following, it discards its current chain and follows the new one.  That's how the network gains decentralized consensus: everyone follows the chain with the most proof of work.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:07:44
It will follow the longest chain.  If a peer node following a valid chain with more blocks, it will abandon its current chain and follow the longer one.

They rejected Segwit, not Layer 2 technologies, though they are not a high priority at the moment.

I fail to see how treating income as income does that.
And since you bring up economic growth, this video makes some very interesting points on the topic: 
But, one important argument they *don't* bring up is that there is an argument to be made that too much wealth inequality may itself stymie economic growth.  The "let's lower corporate/capital gains taxes" crowd often forgets that there is both a demand and supply side to economics. To boost demand you need money in the hands of average individuals.  Meaning: having more equal wealth distribution can boost economic growth because it generates more demand, creating more profitable opportunities for investment.

Over the short term, yes, but long term e-coin would quickly fall back to $1 an e-coin.  For $100,000 to be sustainable, a lot of people are going to be trusting Bitcoin with a significant portion of their wealth, and I just don't see it getting that level of adoption in 1 year.

Are you aware a chain split occurred over it, and a not insignificant portion of the user base went with it?  And prior to the failed Segwit2X proposal, which required Segwit to activate first, Bitcoin Unlimited's scaling proposal had higher signaling than Segwit.  That's should be enough to tell you that Core's scaling plan did not have consensus.

I'm so tired of hearing this argument.  LN isn't a scaling solution by itself either: LN will require much biggest blocks to scale to mass adoption.  So saying LN must come first (when it isn't available yet) is a non-sequitur.  There's research that has demonstrated that 4MB blocks would not add any significant centralization pressures, and it would pretty much eliminate congestion on Bitcoin network, hopefully buying enough time to bring LN into production.  And, a number of ALTs already have more capacity than Bitcoin, so saying Bitcoin is can't lose market share because they don't have a "scaling solution" coming faster is nonsense.

Reaching 100,000K in 1 year seems very unlikely to me.  At that point, market cap would be $2 trillion dollars.  That would put Bitcoin being valued at roughly 50% of M0 (i.e, 50% of all USD in circulation).  I doubt 20% of people have any real understanding of what Bitcoin is at this point, let alone trust it with any significant portion of their savings, so I just don't see how we could support that level of valuation in a year's time.

Bitcoin.org, rightly or wrongly, is recognized by many as an "official" site for the Bitcoin project, and is the site many newbies come to first.  Getting delisted from there is a big deal, and is akin to economic sanctions.  And all that Coinbase did was experiment with an alternative implementation on their testnet, they never even said they were actually going to roll it out to production.
Whenever anyone has offered an alternative to Core's development direction, they have pulled out all the stops to immediately shun them out of the Bitcoin community: calling them scammers, liars, delisting companies from major websites, and not allowing discussion about them on major Bitcoin discussion channels etc.  And this is not happening organically from the community: this is top down.  That is approximating traditional notions of power.

Analogies aren't really sound arguments anyway.  But, this statement doesn't really make sense.  TCP has many useful properties, but security isn't really one of them.  All it does is ensure that:
1) If you get the data, you will get it in the right order, and you will know if some data is missing.
2) The data wont be accidentally corrupted in transmission (but intentional modification by middlemen is possible unless that protection is provided by protocol layers built on top of TCP, like SSL).

@_date: 2017-08-30 23:43:31
Decentralization is not new, that's true, but *historically* the plan was to scale on-chain.  The idea that we need full blocks to artificially create a fee market, that blocks &gt; 1 or 2mb or so would create intolerable centralization pressures, and that we will scale by pushing most transactions onto L2 solutions is relatively new (last 2 years, as far as I can tell).  Even if they're right, the state the Bitcoin is in now, with full blocks and high fees is very much different than where Bitcoin has historically been.  We also don't know for a fact how increasing the block size to 8mb will affect centralization, only projections.  I wont rehash the entire debate, but the point is that not everyone agreed to this *new* roadmap, and so they split off to follow Bitcoin's historical roadmap.
You may be right about the centralization problem.  The good news is we don't have to theorize anymore: we can just let the market work itself out and we can see what happens.  If 8mb blocks overcentralizes Bitcoin Cash, we'll see that happen.  Indeed, since even with L2 solutions, it wont be *that* long before Bitcoin has to scale to 8mb, Bitcoin Cash could provide valuable data.

"So their idea - that I find completely reasonable - is to increase capability one step at a time, beginning from most useful with lowest risk (segwit) and do only what is really required, not what is deemed as needed without evidence. "
So Core decides how many transactions are "really required"?  This is what we call a centrally managed quota.  What if they decide that the block size doesn't need to be increased until average transaction fees reach $20, $50, or even more?  By what yardstick do they decide what is "really required"?
As for LN, people will pay less fees when they make channels with well connected hubs, so it's pretty simple logic that that will tend to lead to centralization.  For that and many other reasons it will likely be highly centralized in practice.  And if you're going to claim its impossible to predict whether LN will be centralized, it follows that you can't claim it won't be.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:05:37
1) Having a maximum block size that is controlled by a development team to limit the number of transactions/block and thus ensure there is a "healthy fee market" is tantamount to a quota.  They are effectively limiting production of a product (transactions) to ensure that fees don't drop too low, arguing that would be bad for the security of bitcoin.
2) LN will hardly be decentralized.  Fees will incentivize people to create payment channels with hubs that are already well connected, leading to centralization.  That effect will be compounded greatly if fees are high on raw Bitcoin.  Even if LN is *not* centralized, though, that doesn't change the fact that Core supports centralized management of the fee market on the raw Bitcoin layer in the form of a quota, and a decentralized LN would not ensure that fees on raw Bitcoin stay low.
So, going back to my original question, on what basis do you claim that people wont be priced off of raw Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:24:12
You're not going to get 100 tx/second with just Segwit unless you're counting off-chain LN transactions.  Segwit provides 2x scaling (or 4x in rare circumstances).

TCP does not guarantee integrity.  As I explained, it prevents accidental data corruption that can be caused by transmission error, but it does nothing to prevent intentional tampering by 3rd parties.  That's not integrity.
As for IP's routing, it's somewhat resistant to certain kinds of network failures, so you could (kinda) make an argument for availability.  But, the guarantees it provides in this respect are quite weak.

No, but its value is linked to how fast and how cheap it is.  The faster and cheaper, the more it will be used as a medium of exchange, and thus the more value it will have.  So, if your use case you are fine with 1 hr transaction times and $20 fees, it may still be in your interests for Bitcoin transactions to be cheaper and faster than that because it will ensure Bitcoin's adoption as a medium of exchange will continue to grow, thus securing Bitcoin's fundamental value.

Not at all.
A product is produced because people derive utility from using them for things other than trade.  Producing more of them means more people can derive more utility from them, and so increases net utility.
Units of currency generally have no utility except as a medium of exchange.  Producing more only dilutes the value of what already exists, and so does not create any net utility.
That is why production quotas are bad for products, but the same does not apply to currencies.

@_date: 2017-08-20 14:50:49
Sure, but the higher the transaction times and/or the higher the fees, the fewer use cases Bitcoin has as a medium of exchange.  The fewer use cases it has, the less people will exchange it for goods and services, and the less intrinsic value it will have.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:43:59
Gold has intrinsic value because of the various ways it can be used (jewelry, art, industrial applications, etc.).  All things used as a store of value are useful for things other than just a store of value.
Bitcoin's intrinsic value is as a medium of exchange that is uncensorable and can be traded over the Internet.  Its trade velocity as a medium of exchange ensures its price stays above a certain price point, as otherwise it can't support the trades its being used for.  Without that, it loses all intrinsic value, and as soon as people realize that its price will crash.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:14:01

There's risks on both sides.  Moving too slowly could drive adoption to other coins, hurting Bitcoin's network effect and first mover advantage.  Moving too quickly could cause accidents that shake people's faith in Bitcoin.  Either way, I think that question is tangential to the scaling debate.  You can scale on-chain with long term planning in mind and you can scale off-chain with shaky short term decisions.
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:27:08

As for security and anonymity, those are meaningless unless Bitcoin already has value and can be traded for goods and services.
"It is circular reasoning, okay, but for example, the only reason gold has value is because as a species we have decided so."
No we didn't *just decide* its valuable.  Gold has many properties that made it valuable to humans: its pretty and its a metal, which means it can be fashioned into all sorts of things, not to mention its many modern industrial applications.  It's also rare and not easily substituted for something else.  And since its already valuable to just about everyone and can't be counterfeited, it works as a decent medium of exchange (though today mostly obsolete in that regard).  These things made gold valuable.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:17:07
Layers are useful for adding additional features: I think most so-called "big blockers" would agree that adding layers on top of Bitcoin is not a bad thing.  It does not follow that layering is the best way to scale Bitcoin, especially when it is so artificially limited as-is.  To use the analogy: no one ever scaled TCP by adding more layers.
What "big blockers" *do* say about layers is that they should be effectively optional: if people are economically priced out of using raw Bitcoin and forced into using higher layers, then we introduce a whole new swath of new centralization risks to the ecosystem beyond miner centralization.

For practical purposes, Segwit is a 2mb limit, and Segwit 2x is a 4mb limit.  Yes, it's theoretically possible to construct an 8 mb block in Segwit 2x, but it depends on the types of transactions in the block, and realistically the vast majority of blocks would be closer to 4mb IF the network was operating at capacity.
@_date: 2017-08-27 06:29:02
You mean like Core is constantly doing to avoid a moderate block size increase?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:49:31
Because to be a good store of value, Bitcoin needs to retain its value, and there is no economic theory that would explain why something intrinsically worthless other than as a store of value would remain valuable.  Think about it, what is the fundamental value if a Bitcoin?  Is its market price of $4,000 usd high or low?  Everyone would like to believe Bitcoin will just keep going up because it always has, but anyone who follows markets know thats not how things work: bubbles form but price always follows fundamentals in the long run.
So, what's the "fundamental" value of a bitcoin?  What gives bitcoin "fundamental" value?  The only convincing economic explanation I've found is that it's use as a medium of exchange gives it fundamental value.  People trading Bitcoin for goods and services or transferring wealth to their family overseas gives Bitcoin value, because if Bitcoin's price were too low there wouldn't be enough coins in circulation to support those transactions.  If you make Bitcoin hard to transact you take away the very thing that gives it value, which makes Bitcoin a poor store of value as well.
Now, some at this point might want to say that Bitcoin's fundamental value comes from its utility as a store of value.  I'd say that's circular reasoning, but let's think about how that would play out.  Let's suppose Bitcoin is "digital gold": a store of value but not a very useful medium of exchange.  Bitcoin's price will continue to grow and things will be fine as long as there is more wealth being put in than is being taken out.  But, that can't go on forever, and as soon as that changes the price starts going down.  At that point, you have a situation where the early sellers will win and the late sellers lose.  So, you could easily have a race for who can sell their coins first, which could snowball until the price falls to zero because remember: no one actually uses Bitcoin for anything but as a store of value and who wants to use a store of value that is losing value rapidly?  The fundamental value of a Bitcoin that's not useful as a medium if exchange is 0.
That's why Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange is important to everyone that uses Bitcoin, even those who just want it to use it as a store of value.
I'd also point out that Bitcoin is and was always intended to be used as money.  The fact that its also good at being "digital gold" is a side benefit, not the other way around.  So, to tell those who those concerned about Bitcoin's viability as a medium of exchange that they should just use another coin is to basically suggest that we hijack Bitcoin for the sake of interests that do not align well with Bitcoin's original purpose or the interests of many of Bitcoin's earliest adopters.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:13:08

Isn't that disagreement just a variation on [Theseus's paradox]( though?
For example, if Coke changed their formula, and then Pepsi was selling Coke's original formula, they might very well want to claim their's is the *real* Coke.  Of course, trademark law would make impossible, but since no one owns Bitcoin's trademark, its more complicated.

No matter how good the code or arguments are, Core wont be convinced if they don't want to be.  And, it doesn't matter, because Core doesn't own Bitcoin; unless you want to say that Core is Bitcoin's Fed.

@_date: 2017-08-20 01:13:48
It's easy to manufacture contention to if you don't want something to change.  Right now, Core seems to be the main main resistance to upping it.  But, even if that were not so, if institutions want to force people to use higher layers (where they get a cut of the transaction fees), and reserve Bitcoin for a settlement layer, they wont mind paying high fees to settle up on the raw Bitcoin layer.  Those institutions can themselves resist changing to the limit, even seeding contention among users to increase the appearance of resistance, and let fees go up to even hundreds of dollars.  Because we have *people* deciding how many transactions there should be on raw Bitcoin in a centralized way instead of letting supply and demand work it out in a free market.

Currency != commodity.  Bitcoin, like USD and most modern currencies, aren't marketable commodities and they never were.  They have no inherent utility except as currency.  Creating more of it doesn't create more value.  It just dilutes the value already there.  Ergo, it doesn't make sense to create more of it except to leech off what other people already have.
However, creating more of a product increases utility, even if it decreases that product's value in a free market.   This is not true of USD or Bitcoin or most modern currencies.
The point is, you're trying to draw an equivalence where there is none.

I wish that were so:
"While you guys might look at the above and try to find a way to make hard forks possible.  We don’t see the value.  We think Bitcoin’s most important property is its immutability.  Accordingly, we think hard forks should always be contentious, because they are a threat to immutability.  I am part of the crowd of true believers that would extend that even to soft forks.  Hard forks remove rules, while soft forks add them.  **I am glad to see that Bitcoin has progressed to the point where hard forks are practically impossible.  I want to see the political contention within Bitcoin factions grow to the point where even soft forks are impossible.  We may already be there.**  While I think that SegWit is fantastic and am fine with its implementation.  But if it is blocked, Bitcoin will have reached another milestone towards achieving true immutability.  We don’t want to “bridge the gap,” because contention secures immutability.  This is, I think, the essence of so-called Nakamoto consensus.  As diversity in usership grows, consensus becomes impossible, and THIS is what ultimately secures Bitcoin.  Compromise and agreement are the enemy to immutability."

The BTC/BCH addresses are the same, there is no way to tell them apart just by looking at the address itself.
If you send BTC to an address intended for BCH, the Bitcoin will transfer to that address.  What happens then is up the recipient.  By importing their private key into a Bitcoin wallet, they could return the Bitcoin to you.  But, whether they will be willing to do that is another matter.  In the case of large companies and exchanges, the money is probably lost.

Yes, LN can be done more efficiently with a malleability fix, but it isn't required and does make LN less secure if implemented properly.  Anyway, I expect they'll implement a malleability fix at some point.

It's not about dishonesty though.  If Pepsi's selling something identical to what was historically called as Coke for decades, why is that necessarily not the *real* Coke?  Just because a company says so?
The point is: what one values and defines as "Bitcoin" can be different for different people, and the chain split is a real-world manifestation of that difference.  The Bitcoin whitepaper says nothing about which chain is the real "Bitcoin" once you start changing the consensus rules: it was just never really an issue because until recently there were no contentious forks in Bitcoin's history.  However, at this point, both chains are running on different consensus rules than what Bitcoin was running on on July 31st, so neither is the same as the old Bitcoin.  Just because one side is in the minority doesn't make them liars.
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:45:05
No, I had not seen the thread, but I have read the article.  The top couple of comments miss the point: no one is claiming that LN hubs can steal your funds.  Rather, one of the main arguments for small blocks is it ensures the full node count remains large, making the network difficult to attack or control.  But, since LN will be centralized via hubs, it will be easier much easier for entities, such as the government, to control/regulate it.  US is already cracking down on "local bitcoin"-type sellers.  Why would we think LN hubs will be any different?
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:36:04
If you own the keys to an address, and that address had a Bitcoin balance when the chain split occurred, then yes.

It wont.  Even in the DAO HF, which I doubt will ever happen again, they simply implemented a new rule to move the affected Ether to a new location.  They didn't actually remove blocks or data from the blockchain, so no data encoded on the blockchain can be "lost" this way.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:16:16

Give me a break.  The whitepaper is titled "Bitcoin: A *Peer-to-Peer Digital Cash* System".  *You* may have decided Bitcoin is better as digital gold, but don't go around saying "it's intended as X" or that people who believe otherwise "have been mislead."
And by the way, I think you're playing a fool's game.  Bitcoin cannot work as a pure store of value, because why what would hold up its price?  Utility as a medium of exchange is what ensures Bitcoin's value stays up.  Think about it, the last person to buy into a pure store-of-value Bitcoin will not get back what he put in, because its price only stays up as long as people are buying it.  So, why would that last person buy it in the first place?  He's got nothing to gain.  And if he doesn't buy, the person before him has nothing to gain either, and so on.  A "pure store-of-value" Bitcoin is just a Ponzi scheme...no thank you.

@_date: 2017-11-15 08:08:24
Disagree.  While those properties are valuable, the blockchain isn't meant or designed for storing arbitrary data.  With the exception of OP_RETURN (which is effectively disabled due to SegWit, now, I believe) there is no compact way to encode arbitrary data on the Bitcoin blockchain.  You can't just write the data raw, you have to encode it as outputs or some other nonsense, which bloats the encoding and makes it more expensive (because you pay by the byte).  So, if the fee for a basic 250 byte transaction were $0.30, as it was not that long ago, that would be enough to discourage mosts uses of the Block Chain space for things other than transactions.  This is especially true since there are already better solutions for arbitrary data storage, such as Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:42:45


Completely agree.  His design and vision were imperfect.  But, his paper is certainly relevant if you want to talk about what Bitcoin's *intention* is.  To imply that someone "has been mislead" for having a particular understanding of Bitcoin that happens to match that of the original whitepaper is absurd.


Might be.  But, that would need to be demonstrated.

You made a claim that Bitcoin was intended as a replacement for gold and not meant for payments.  That is flatly false.


Yeah, Bitcoin has a decentralized consensus mechanism...  I have no idea what that has to do with whether Bitcoin is intended for payments, or whether it can be a viable store of value without being a medium of exchange.


That's not my claim.  I said Bitcoin's value comes from being a medium of exchange.  Its that utility which props up its price, which makes it also useful as a store of value.  That does not mean it can *only* have value if someone can buy coffee with it: it does not need to serve *all* markets.  Microtransactions may just not be the market Bitcoin serves (not onchain, at least).  But, if its not useful as a medium of exchange anywhere, then I don't think it has any fundamental value.


Already read it.  It makes quite clear Bitcoin is intended for payments.  Not sure what else you want me to get from that.

It's not kicking the can down the road, it's buying time until layer 2 solutions become viable.  That's acting on a solvent, long-term plan, the opposite of kicking the can down the road.  And, it *has* been studied.  There's the Cornell study that was done last year, for instance.  Even Adam Black said *back in 2014* that a increase to 2 or 4mb would have no impact on centralization pressures.

Transaction fees are not inversely proportional to block size.  You can't just divide the BTC's current transaction price by 8 and call it a day.  The current 8mb capacity is more than enough to handle BTC's entire mempool at a nominal fee.

They agreed to a SegWit HF that included a block size increase.  Core changed the terms on them.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:45:19
Segwit has value, even if size is increased.  Transaction malleability fix, and script versioning are good things.  Plus, LN gives gives an option for faster confirmation times and lower fees.  But, LN should be an option, not the only economical way for everyday consumers to transact in BitCoin.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:56:32

Seems Core is just as fond of them.  They could have increased block size years ago, but refused.  Now that they aren't getting their way, they're trying to get it pushed through with a contentious UASF, which is every bit as risky (or more so) than a HF ever would have been.

Err...a single bitcoin has grown in value many times over the course of that graph.  So, yes, if you measure sales using the number of bitcoins as your metric, you're doing to see a downward trend.

Average transaction fees are currently about $1.  Compared to a year ago, when the average transaction fees were just a few cents, that's a huge jump, so its causing some sticker-shock.  More objectively, though, it makes bitcoin non-competitive for transactions less than $30, and that really undercuts bitcoin's value proposition as a digital currency at a time when people otherwise might seriously consider adopting bitcoin for their day-to-day transactions and when there are many competing altcoins with both lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times.  Bitcoin is currently highly competitive for remittances, international trade, and possibly as a long-term investment, but not much else.  More concerning, though, is the transaction fees will continue to rise as bitcoin adoption increases, until a scaling solution is agreed upon and adopted.  Right now, there are basically two camps: the "bigger block" camp, and the "segwit/lightning network" camp.  Both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages, and it partly depends on your vision of what bitcoin is/should be.  The debate has gone on quite a while, and it seems that there is quite a bit of mistrust between these camps at this point.

Miners already have an incentive to validate and ignore invalid blocks.  But, even if that were not the case, full nodes outnumber the majority of miners by orders of magnitude.  A 2mb increase in block size poses no risk in disturbing that balance.

If UASF activates, the split will occur as soon as someone mines a non-segwit signaling block.  At that point, miners have two options:
Option  refuse the block and commit to mining a segwit-only chain.
Option  accept the block and continue mining the longest chain per existing consensus rules.
The problem is that even if the miner wants segwit, other miners (even segwit-signaling ones) may choose to accept the non-segwit signaling block and continue to mine on top of it.  So, to take option  they are betting on the segwit-only chain "winning."  That's a risky proposition, which is why segwit-signaling miners wont necessarily go along with a UASF.
