Maybe so but it can't be argued that many of these altcoins have a higher utility value than bitcoin. I'd hope that investors are buying these coins for their tech use but odds are that this isint the case.

I'd say all of these comments are not an attack at all. Unfortunately bitcoin is not in a good state right now. It's sad but it's the truth.

It's only a roller coaster if you go down ;) Don't worry about it.

I've never seen something so accurately show it until now.

I think watching this clip was the highlight of my day.

Xcoins is a good site. Definetly more expensive than exchanges but you get to use PayPal.

This wasn't the case though. Yes of course the market could have died and he could have lost all his bitcoin value but this wasn't the case. Just a stupid few digit password separating him from 30k. You should always be worried about losing money because of the bitcoin market but never because you can't remeber a dam pin. That shouldn't be something an investor is afraid of.

I wanted to explode just by reading your story. I could honestly feel your frustration and anxiety that this ordeal had caused you. Such a large amount of money in your hands that is entirely inaccessible. I could feel the weight lift off your chest the second the PIN popped up. I hope this serves as a lesson for people invested in the world of crypto currency. Keep your seeds/ pins safe and secure. Back these passwords up in multiple physical forms. An hour of prepping these systems could save you the loss of your crypto fortune years from. I'm glad everything worked out my friend.
