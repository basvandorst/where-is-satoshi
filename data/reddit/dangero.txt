I still don't understand the objective of no third party software. Technically the operating system of the calculator is third party software and I assume you're planning to use that.

A graphing calculator is a mini-computer. It's several steps and would be error prone to do each calculation by hand, but of course it could be done. As you know a graphing calculator can run programs so you could write a program on the graphing calculator to do it.
This all begs the question of how this is different than using a computer with no internet connection.

It gets into nuance here and I guess we can wait and see in the long run if this matters, but I can do WELL BEYOND those numbers with a centralized server model. None of the coins you name are attempting to be decentralized like Bitcoin is. That does not make them useless necessarily.
Stellar and Ripple are federated:
IOTA is 100% centralized so it's kind of like a low performance client-server model right now. If you're talking about what the IOTA team says they will do in the future, I have some hoverboards to sell you. (they don't work yet, but they will later)

It sounds paranoid, but should it considering all the Snowden leaks? Similar questions could be asked about any hardware secure wallet like Trezor. How do I know this device is not compromised at a chip level? Also, really the main reason to believe the Trezor probably isn't compromised by a nation state is because Bitcoin isn't all that big a deal yet. Imagine a future where Bitcoin is much more commonplace than it is today and most people own several Trezor-like devices even if they don't actually know it uses Bitcoin under the hood. If you were a large government would you not be trying to find your way into a secure chip or anywhere else in the system that would grant you control and information?
I'm not saying the people who built Trezor are corrupt. Like Vinay says, how can you fully secure a complete supply chain? I'm saying it only takes one person to switch a chip pile with one that looks identical and is identically marked, but is back-doored. If crypto-currencies become ubiquitous I believe we will see hacks at every level on an unprecedented scale because there will be unprecedented incentives to do so.

He'll do very well. He's selling his connections more than anything else. That's how business works. It's who you know more than what you know. Yes, there may be those companies that shun him for the regulation work he did, but the ones that want to climb the growing pile of regulation will absolutely hire him.
And here's the thing. There's a lot of Bitcoin companies out there. The ones that you hear about a lot: The Circles, Coinbases and 21s... Those companies work connections. They aren't altruistic staunch black and white no compromise political activists. They've already worked all kinds of connections to get where they are. In a way those companies are a perfect match for Lawsky. If I were in their shoes I'd be very excited to hire him, but I'd want to do it without anyone knowing I did so since there could be negative repercussions from the community. That's why you probably won't hear who hires him while at the same time he will become tremendously rich.

I'm pro bitcoin and I think this is false. Private blockchains do have use just not based on SHA256 POW consensus. I haven't heard of anyone saying they plan to use SHA256 POW on a private blockchain. Bitcoin does not have a monopoly on blockchains or even blockchain security.
I think the intranet/internet analogy makes sense. You could think about the internet as just the biggest intranet. Bitcoin is the most popular blockchain right now. It may stay that way, it may not.
Bitcoin is actually not interoperable with smaller blockchains right now so that means any other blockchain has to "compete". I think of sidechains as a way to build new blockchains without competing with Bitcoin. That will strengthen the analogy of bitcoin/private blockchains and internet/intranet

Here's how it affects bitcoin more: The current banking system is based on human handshakes, not cryptographic trust, so if the underlying computers were damaged through a backdoor, the parties can get together and roll back to last known good state. Obviously it's not THAT simple, but it is a contrast to Bitcoin. If the NSA used their power to steal say 25% of the Bitcoin private keys people have, there is no possible way to handshake and roll back. It's game over.
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:45:29
Yes that's true, but turing completeness is a pretty superficial concern about Bitcoin scripting. It has been well known that loops could be soft forked, but to what end?
Bitcoin lacks the proper infrastructure to handle turing completeness. The Halting Problem is solved in other turing complete cryptocurrencies by charging the program for usage of cpu cycles. This means it no longer matters how much time the program takes provided that the program has enough money to pay for the usage. When the program runs out of money it is stopped in its tracks. Bitcoin does not have the infrastructure to do that. Bitcoin scripts are charged fees based on code size which loops fundamentally destroy. Furthermore, Bitcoin lacks the P2P model and blockchain state machine required to handle turing complete program execution when the execution is split across multiple blocks. If the goal is to give Bitcoin features like other advanced cryptos you're really just going to be completely changing Bitcoin and almost for sure breaking it in the process.
The best approach I've seen is sidechains which will allow modularization of advanced features without creating new competing currencies. See Rootstock and Elements.

He explains that in the video. If Intel chips are compromised the NSA would not utilize that backdoor unless it had an extremely strong reason to do so. If the backdoor were known people would stop using the chips and the NSA would lose its power. It's kind of a one shot deal if done on a massive scale.

Federation is enough for most private blockchain scenarios. I see them being useful in cases where you have occasional social consensus like picture a bank blockchain consortium where they meet a few times a year in person. 51% isn't really an issue in that case. It's very similar to the blockstream elements sidechain. In fact, that might be how they plan to make money -- the confidential transaction system they developed would be very helpful for the bank scenario.

Scheduled forks essentially are arguing against proof of work in exchange for a more social consensus. If you like that idea you should check out a POS coin like Bitshares or NXT because you can get that effect without burning so much energy using a social consensus backed check-pointed client.

You're arguing it's black and white in the opposite direction. It's not black and white on several levels whether it's stealing or not.
First of all, if I tell you that it's still your money, but you can't withdraw it right now, then how long can I hold it before it IS stealing? 10 years? 50 years? Secondly, once a government locks access to your funds it becomes much easier to say, "We just need it a little longer."
So, if you are a person with some money, when is the best time to put your foot down? To me it seems to be the second that the government suggests they need to freeze your money. If you let them freeze it for 2 years, then why not 3 years, and if 3 years then why not 4? There is no right answer.

You don't need a VPS for each node. You just need multiple IP addresses and bandwidth.
@_date: 2015-12-25 09:54:50
Hmm I wonder if this could be the angle by which crypto is banned -- as crypto improves the anonymity aspects will improve so this seems like an obvious line that any government can draw after a couple terrorist attacks -- "We need to ban all anonymous money transfers and therefore any cryptocurrencies that are anonymous as well." So this would make things like Blockstream Elements confidential transactions illegal. It's an interesting line because it wouldn't outright ban crypto, but it would mean that the government could arrest you purely for using it to create anonymous transactions. In this case the very act of creating privacy is what is illegal, not your reasons for doing so.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:27:18
I'm not sure that has anything to do with it. Since all you need is a distinct IP address to impersonate a distinct node, one person could attack the network with 10,000+ bad actor nodes.

I think I just figured out something that was bothering me: How did Craig Wright become a speaker at a Bitcoin conference when nobody knew anything about him yet? Someone who received leaked documents must have tipped off someone who was running this conference to get in touch with him for the panel. The conference was about a month ago and coincidentally they said the investigation has been going on for a month. He was not actually at the event which means he may have been even invited to be on the panel at the last minute.
Further evidence: Why do you invite some guy who can't even make the panel in person and nobody has heard of to be on a panel at a conference? You must know something that not everyone knows.
Also during the Q&amp;A Steve Michaels asks Craig a question about something he posted on Twitter recently. How and why was Steven Michaels so aware of who Craig is, why was he following him on Twitter, and how was Craig the focus of so many questions when you've got Nick Szabo sitting right there?

I think you're overestimating how many people need to get on board. For example, if 2 of the major exchanges are against the hard fork, they would definitely change their mind if the fork was happening and they could see that they were on the minority side of the debate.

I was in agreement till you got to the altcoin part.

At this point exporting encryption seems like such a stupid thing to make illegal. Who really believes that these countries can't do their own secure cryptography if we don't give it to them? Do we have some monopoly on math I'm not aware of?
When cryptography was first being developed, I get it. It's a natural knee jerk reaction to learning that the previously unencrypted signals of foreign powers won't be available for NSA listening any longer. At that point, yes a lot of companies didn't have good crypto technology. We're in 2014 now. Just seems like a very outdated policy.

It's not that simple though. He admitted in his interview with AP that he was an engineer and COULD have built Bitcoin. We can find his old coworkers. That's the place to look. Then the question is, how much does he know about the specific technologies involved in Bitcoin. As an engineer how can he choose which to deny? He can't deny knowledge of every technical concept, so it's a really difficult decision for him on every question. How does he choose which to lie about?

On some level, he has to be. The free lunch has no other explanation.
First of all, he moved to the US when he was 10 years old 54 years ago, so any excuse about misunderstanding a conversation cannot be believed. Charlie Shrem and a lot of others on Reddit have pushed forth this idea that his language skills are poor. IMPOSSIBLE. Yes, he may write poorly when he's being casual online, but he went to highschool and college in the US, then worked on classified engineering projects for the US government.

Yes, it is an EFT. The transferred funds are used to buy Bitcoins on an open market. Some exchanges automatically do the transfer at market rate, others allow you to hold fiat in your account and trade back and forth freely.
There is generally a fee to transfer from hard currency to Bitcoin as well as a fee to transfer from Bitcoin to hard currency. That fee is generally 1% in each direction, although it depends on the particular service.
Your question raises a good point that I think gets glossed over a lot. Bitcoin shines most in situations where you don't need to transfer back into hard currency due to the fees that you mentioned. Once you are "in the system" you feel the real benefits.

I'm pretty sure someone will tell me that I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I'll give it a stab anyways:
One of the tenants of Libertarianism is that markets self regulate when all members of the market have equal and reasonable rights. Therefore Libertarians are fundamentally non-violent. They are essentially arguing that the problem with governments is that they infringe on personal rights and give advantages to certain market players. If they did not do that then the markets would efficiently regulate and the government wouldn't need to be a part of the market at all.
Anarchists believe that the free market will always promote cartels and monopolies. Their solution to this is to dismantle the cartels and essentially force the removal of large market players by any means necessary, including violence.
What Vinay argues in this video is that the Bitcoin mining situation to date is a great experiment into what happens when free markets exist. We are seeing centralization of mining between several large pools, so this is essentially what he believes to be evidence that in a completely free market, it does not properly self regulate. We are seeing a few large players monopolize the market and we have even seen them threaten Bitcoin as a whole (GHASH.IO). Under that line of thinking, the Libertarians were wrong.

You might still be OK though because Math.Random on both Firefox and Chrome pull from urandom on Mac. I'd have to look over the Firefox source code again to see if you're OK for sure.

Yeah Szabo's bitgold writeup is light on CS details that would require more applied references, so I think time-stamping references make a lot of sense. He also may not have worked alone, but I don't believe that someone could arrive at Bitcoin without reading bitgold or talking to Nick. From my perspective it's clearly a progression on that idea. For example, Szabo defined mining using proof of work, but did not come up with the idea of adjusted mining complexity on the consensus network. That was an open issue in the bitgold proposal that Szabo pointed out. Szabo has been writing about solving the Byzantine Generals problem since as early as 2003:
I guess it's theoretically possible that someone had all the same thoughts without knowing about Szabo's work, but to me that just seems incredibly unlikely. The lack of Szabo reference in the original paper is definitely significant.

I don't see how that makes it a bad analogy. I think you're agreeing with me. My point was, I normally have access to over $20,000 in my wallet with almost no risk. How will I do that with Bitcoin?
The current answer seems to be, "Noob! Don't carry more Bitcoins than the cash you would put in your wallet."
Then OK, Bitcoin is a cash replacement, but it doesn't replace credit cards? That's not the future of Bitcoin I've been hearing about. I've been hearing about lower transaction fees than credit cards. Higher transaction fees than cash though. Like you're saying Bitcoin comes with no insurance, so why would it replace my credit cards in any way?
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:55:24
I agree. "It's Southpark" is not an argument either. I've definitely noticed a prejudice on this subreddit about "the Chinese" as I've seen them called. For one thing, Chinese people aren't organized in their bitcoin purchasing any more than people are in any other country. There's no Chinese grand price conspiracy. Sure, there could be specific people manipulating the market, and some of those may be Chinese, but it's certainly not "the Chinese", as if they are all working together.

If there actually is an attack on the network then I think the worst case scenario would be a fork of the network where honest miners upgrade to a new version of the bitcoin software that blocks further abuse. It's also a safe bet that would not even be necessary. If an attack occurred through one of the largest mining pools, the price of bitcoin would probably fall rapidly. This drop in price would be the necessary incentive to move miners off of the larger mining pools and especially the corrupt mining pool.
Basically, no matter what I think it would not affect bitcoin long term.

Man I'm so sick of bad security through blockchain.info hitting the front page. I think there's a few reasons for this incentive-wise:
1. In software development, the skills required to launch software quickly are not the same ones required to create a reliable and secure release process. Blockchain.info did create a notable online wallet early on, but that does not mean they are good at reliable software processes.
2. The ease of setup lures in users, but it does not idiot proof their security. This creates a mismatch because a low tech user is looking for an easy setup situation, so they choose blockchain.info, but they also can't possibly be asked to understand why they need an especially long password for their online wallet; nor are they likely to use proper safety precautions with their password.
3. The architecture of blockchain.info's wallet means Blockchain.info can only do so much to hold their user's hands. This means users will continue to lose money even if BCI does everything right security-wise.
4. Blockchain.info's wallet is a great hacker target because they have a large number of low tech users and help store a ton of BTC.
5. Web wallets are harder to secure than standalone clients development-wise. Some might even say they are impossible to secure.
It's obvious at this point that they have prioritized growth over proper software process. This is always a difficult balance in business, but I think they have handled this poorly. It points to bad management which from my experience comes from at least one of two sources:
1. The lead developer does not have the discipline to focus on reliable process over feature expansion while he also has enough control in the company that nobody can tell him what to do.
2. The lead developer has too little control and people above him are forcing him to prioritize moving fast over anything else.
Regardless, it just feels like they are employing the "move fast, break things" style startup mentality which is totally an inappropriate way to deal with other peoples' money. Also, as long as their user base continues to grow and they continue to secure massive amounts of VC money maybe they feel that they have no reason to change. By their goals perhaps their strategy is working the best.

The signature on the time locked transaction is absolutely automatic.
The signature on their 2 of 2 multisig transactions is also automatic I believe. They are doing that 2 of 2 to solve doublespends. Since they need to sign a transaction in order for it to be valid they can verify that the funds are not doublespent and using BIP 70 extension for instant confirmation they can let the merchant know that they guarantee no doublespends.

@_date: 2014-02-03 17:46:59
That's not completely true. First of all, with a central limit order book you can get detailed information about all the orders that are sitting in the queue through a public API. Secondly, you can place your own orders on the exchange to verify that the exchange is not skimming. Perhaps you could say at best that the exchange sometimes cheats on certain transactions since you can't verify every single one, but you can certainly verify that the exchange does not skim off all negative spread transactions.

Simplest way would be to use localbitcoins.com and there would be fees involved which would probably be less than the 10% Western Union is charging, but also it would require more technical skills to use bitcoins.
I agree though, there is no scam here. When you realize that Western Union pays rent so that they have a place to drop off and pick up payments plus employs people to work there, it all starts adding up. Western Union is a single entity, so they have no money transfer costs within the US because they can simply deposit their funds in the bank and then withdraw them from another location. Their costs are completely related to dealing with customers and fraud insurance.

"Same exchange rate, so no hidden fees."

No, Satoshi doesn't mention smart contracts in the Bitcoin paper, but does in conversation to Wei Dai.

money and transactions."

@_date: 2014-06-16 08:29:22
trusted_instant_providers does not seem very future proof because there could be a ton of instant providers in the future. There could be literally a million of them. Do you really want to attach every single one that you support to the payment details message?
Why does the person making the payment need to know if instant transactions are accepted when making the purchase?
Also, some services already support instant transactions without trust on all transactions, so how do these fields allow them to state that? Do they really need to list every single possible instant vendor? That will be an impossible task and silly because they don't require a trusted instant provider to do an instant transaction.
I suggest that the only part of this BIP that is needed is the in payment message portion. If the merchant supports instant confirmation from the given provider then the transaction will be confirmed instantly.

Somewhat, but hashcash is not a full decentralized money system like bitgold. Bitgold has more than just proof of work in common with Bitcoin. Adam Back didn't invent the term "Smart Contracts"; Szabo did long before Bitcoin, long before the mainstream took any notice of him. Like I said, Szabo could be considered the most valuable person to crypto-currencies even if he didn't write the code. That's why his general absence from the conversation now is such a surprise to me. You could say he didn't like public speaking, but then he used to do it before Bitcoin on these very topics.

I agree that you need some form of trust signatures, but I believe the trust signatures could be part of an automated reputation system.

If people always took the easy solution Bitcoin would not exist.

Good point. For example, if someone steals my password and drains my account, can that really be insured against? Seems unlikely because it would be too easy to fake a theft and pocket the coins.
I'm guessing the insurance relates more to them saying that they won't lose your coins like Mt. Gox, but even then, if they lose all the funds they are holding how will they possibly hope to cover that. I'd think they would just fold in that case. "It's insured" sounds good though!

Leaving coins in Coinbase is inherently unsafe because you are not controlling your own Bitcoin keys.
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:11:27
I think the end game for Bitcoin will be bitcoin specific hardware devices that protect your keys and run really limited amounts of code. Insurance from companies like Coinbase could be considered a bandaid and it also removes a lot of the true benefits of Bitcoin. For example, the US government could seize your Coinbase account and take your coins. They cannot do that if you hold the private keys yourself.
@_date: 2014-07-16 23:38:45
I do actually. It's a lot more complicated than just believing a contract. Insurance only works when not everyone needs it. It also depends on who is providing the insurance. If they are providing their own insurance, then insurance is lost in bankruptcy. That's why US state governments have made laws specifically for life insurance that they will pick up the policy for bankrupt life insurance providers. In California that is limited to $200,000 of life insurance though, so if you buy a million dollar policy and the insurance company goes under, you now have a $200,000 policy paid by the state. For the type of insurance we are talking about there would be no government backed coverage.
Secondly, There are a lot of examples of how insurance doesn't work when a large claim is submitted. For example, in the 2008 financial crisis the largest insurers could not cover their claims because insurance runs off of statistics of failures. In 2008 home loans were falling through at a much higher than the statistical average rate causing too many claims for AIG to cover.
The government bailed them out. The government is not going to bail out Circle.
Another example would be something like Earthquake insurance which doesn't work because when a quake happens everyone needs it. This happened in the 1994 Northridge quake:
The government now created an earthquake insurance pool since private companies couldn't carry the burden. The government will not do this for Circle.
The US government insures bank balances in a similar way with FDIC.
My point was that in the future if Circle grows and so does the Bitcoin economy there is NO WAY their insurance policy can cover a complete loss of their Bitcoins and they won't have the government there to fix it for them.
EDIT: Added note about FDIC

I think this skepticism for me partially comes from the fact that the difficult details were not completely publicly fleshed out before raising money. In that way I guess it's similar to a private company who raises money to do some cancer drug research, but companies like that usually have to be very careful as far as what forward looking statements they make. This project never said, "We will try and see what happens." Instead they say things on their website like, "Storj is open-source while also being safer, cheaper, more private and secure compared to traditional cloud storage providers."

15,000 vendors is not very much. Most businesses that use Bitpay are almost certainly using the 1% transaction fee, no monthly fee plan and are probably doing very low volume of Bitcoin transactions.

Does Circle say who they are insured by? If not then what you're saying is just speculation.
All I could find is this:
3.6 Theft Insurance. In the event that any bitcoins held in your Circle Account are lost or stolen as a result of a direct breach of Circle’s digital or physical storage facilities your bitcoins are fully insured, subject to the terms and conditions of Circle’s insurance policy. If your bitcoins are lost or stolen as a result of your own failure to maintain proper security protocols in accordance with Section 1.3, such loss is not be covered by Circle’s insurance. You should also note that deposits are insured by a private insurance company, and not by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) or any other governmental agency.

It sounds silly at first, but I have no doubt this type of thing will happen.
Technically you could go pretty granular with Bitcoin if you wanted to. You could get paid a fraction of your salary ~every 10 minutes, whereas with the current banking system using ACH you can really only do one transfer per day and you can't do transfers at all on holidays or the weekend.
It's not at all a bad idea and I think in the long run something like this will happen. We are just accustomed to waiting for a check every 2 weeks. It might even take generations for people to get out of the old banking mindset.
My wife and I actually do something like this with our current bank accounts and if we could, we would go more granular. We both have our own spending accounts and we've set it up so that every day we get an automatic transfer of a reasonable spending amount. As mentioned before, the system breaks down on holidays/weekends because our bank doesn't do automatic transfers on those days.
Great thought!

Here's the reason that I think Nick Szabo is at least part of Satoshi Nakamoto: Where is Nick now? If you read his bitgold work it's clear that he is the main inventor of Bitcoin technology. Perhaps he didn't write the code and you could theorize that someone implemented his ideas, but still, where is he? He was speaking at conferences about smart contracts in 2004 and now he can't be found speaking anywhere. He can't even be found PERIOD. Not a single picture online except one unconfirmed from decades ago. He barely blogs. Nobody seems to know where he works or how he survives. Come on! Really? The most likely candidate to be Satoshi and nobody has tracked him down to find out even some of these details?
Think about this for a second. Regardless of if he was involved in writing the Bitcoin core code he would be the most sought after speaker at any Bitcoin conference. Does it even matter whether he wrote the code or not? Bitcoin is really his idea. The fact that he isn't out talking about digital cash and smart contracts to me says a lot. Can you imagine the hype if a Bitcoin conference announced Nick Szabo was their keynote speaker?
My guess is that per his published request, someone did offer to help him code up his work. He is not acting alone. The person(s) involved made the Satoshi pseudonym together. I think it's also possible that there are many people in the community who know who Satoshi is. For example Gavin Andresen might know who Satoshi is, but pretends to not per the request of Satoshi.
According to this article Nick Szabo attended a Bitcoin conference with Gavin in March with no public fanfare:

I guess I don't see how that's connected to HD wallets still. Sorry, can you explain further? Are you saying that mobile wallets were implemented as a single address? Couldn't an HD wallet just as easily be implemented to send change back to the same address?
My understanding of bip 32 is that it provides a way to deterministically generate many bitcoin addresses from a single random seed. Prior to bip 32, addresses were each generated using different random seeds. Generating a new address seems equally difficult using either approach HD just provides the advantage of not needing to be backed up for each key because you can deterministically generate them again from the master key.
The reference client is not an HD wallet, but generates a new random address whenever it needs one.

Having designed a similar shared storage system prior to Bitcoin, I'm still skeptical that this project will succeed. There are a number of subtle ways that it could fail without it being initially apparent:
1. Centralization could creep in to solve difficult problems
2. Network bandwidth requirements could be less than scaleable
3. Network could be less than 100% reliable
4. Farming could be unprofitable or storing files could be too expensive. Will the economy actually make sense?
@_date: 2014-06-20 05:32:16
It's not the same risk though. Here's why: With multibit or electrum, SOMEONE is probably checking the source and md5 matching the binary to their own build. That's what the Bitcoin community does for you. With the app store apps, literally nobody can do that.

Wow you're so wrong about that scenario being extremely unlikely. This must be a laptop free network then?
I worked on an architecture for this type of system a few years ago and I came to the conclusion that you would need MANY more than 3 copies of a file if you wanted the network to be completely reliable. You certainly can't give people storage back at a 1:3 ratio. What happens when their connection goes down? Do you delete all their backups from the network since they aren't contributing any more?

I think part of the problem is that the term "blockchain" is not well defined and it's also a hot word like "cloud" was five years ago, or "big data" was two years ago, so everyone wants to say they are working on one.
Some innovations of the blockchain are very valuable for institutions and they CAN in fact use them in a private setting. For example, a group of banks can create a new proof of stake altcoin, split up the coins evenly, and then checkpoint the clients. By doing this they can then create an asset system similar to counterparty right on top of it. You could do this with a fork of NXT or BitShares. This DOES provide advantages for them over a traditional database because the database is distributed and there is automated consensus through the blockchain. This avoids any centralizing issues that a normal database has around conflict resolution and who has write access, etc.
Also the blog post mentions this, but it's important to keep in mind that blockchains need some form of incentive, but at the same time not any particular incentive. Bitcoin is absolutely not the only incentive that is valid in this context. It doesn't even have to be a coin incentive at all.
In general I don't think there is any reason to fear people using "blockchains" for other uses and most of these private uses will not compete with Bitcoin in any way. Bitcoin is the most secure and decentralized blockchain in existence. That's what makes it significant and what will continue to give it value.

Since the police have now confirmed the reporter's story about the original conversation at his house I've been thinking about this.
Part of the main reason people are saying that Dorian is not the real Satoshi is because he can "hardly speak english" based on his online writing. That CANNOT be true. Think about this: He moved to the United States when he was 10 years old. That is 50 years ago. FIFTY! He knows how to speak english and he sure as hell can write better than he did in those online posts people are scrutinizing. He's not some guy who just flew over from Japan 5 years ago. He's been working for the US government on classified engineering projects. Are we supposed to believe that the government hired an engineer who couldn't even learn english in 50 years and could not communicate well with his team? If he's a computer engineer who works on government projects then that means he's been writing detailed technical documentation for a LONG time. Think about it.
I'm not saying Satoshi is Dorian, I'm just saying his online writing does not show his true capabilities.

Yes the incrementing sequence and replace concept is enforceable. What is not enforceable is forcing any particular miner to add a transaction or transaction replacement to a block. This is already true for standard transactions.
Also you can't really say that a miner has to add the newest version to a block because you can't even know that the miner has that transaction in their mempool. You can only say that if the miner adds a replacement transaction it has to be newer than the current one.

A false sense of security can absolutely be worse than nothing. It's been shown time and time again that Apple cannot detect backdoors in App Store apps. I've released a lot of apps myself and I know what kinds of issues they do find.
Stealing Bitcoins would be so subtle it would take months of man hours to audit each app release by hand before you could be sure that was not happening and even still it would be an error prone human process.

They don't. A centralized database can store the same information as Factom. In fact, that's how it works now:
Obviously a centralized database can be retroactively modified, but none of the fines that the big banks paid were due to record tampering through companies like Core Logic. Using the blockchain to timestamp documents is certainly a great innovation for all kinds of legal documents, but it doesn't appear to be the innovation that the mortgage industry is clamoring for. If it was, companies like Core Logic would simply start using the blockchain to timestamp documents they are holding.

This is a suggestion to change the miner rules such that they must obey sequence numbers for transaction replacement. In other words, let's imagine you wrote a check to somebody and version 1 of the check says $500. It also says on the check that it cannot be cashed for 60 days. 30 days later you come back with a new check that is for $50 instead of $500. This one has the exact same check number, but it says it is "version 2". These new miner rules would dictate that the version 2 check would supersede the version 1 check.

How did you come to that conclusion from the post? I actually came to the opposite. They don't sell them on exchanges immediately because they can't technically do that. Based on the requirements they list before establishing "a relationship" with an exchange, I would say they are in fact selling coins on exchanges. If they just want to look at the order book to simulate a market order I wouldn't really call that a relationship.
What I think they are implying is that they sell on a number of exchanges. They have "relationships" with those exchanges. When they need to give a price quote they combine the order books from all the exchanges they have a relationship with and then simulate an order taking place to see what the best rate would be. That doesn't mean they don't sell the coins on the exchange later. That just means they first need to give the price quote up front and that's the logical way to do it.

They admit they don't monitor ALL exchanges, nor would it be possible to do so since some of them don't provide a public order book. Therefore, they don't even know if that statement is true.
I think what they mean to say is that they give you a better price than you'll get using one of the exchanges that they have a relationship with, but that's not what they said. Since they don't publish a list of the exchanges they work with, that would be akin to saying, "You'll always get a better price with us than with some other exchanges. We just aren't going to tell you which."

There's actually provisions in the payment protocol for this type of thing. Green Address pioneered the process and it's been around for a couple years now. The most basic design is 2 of 2 multisig address based. The idea is that since the user only holds one of two keys, they cannot double-spend.

The point of this writeup is that chart, but denominated in USD instead of BTC. The one you linked shows peaks and valleys, but what OP discovered is that if you denominate the same chart in USD it shows a continuous climb of worldwide volume. This is a better indicator of the bitcoin value transfer volume than measuring bitcoin volume directly because USD is much less volatile than BTC.

"I know I bought some gray market medication a long time back...not silk road or anything. Not even a controlled substance. I dunno..."
What do you mean "I dunno"? If I bought some gray market medication online 2 years ago I'd remember the details and even the amount I spent especially if it was only once, so I feel like you're not being forthcoming and you kind of know what happened. Sounds like the same thing that would happen if you used an ACH transfer from your bank account to buy a "gray market medication". You'd get your account closed. It probably happened now because somebody just discovered the gray market operator and then coinbase hit their database for transaction matches and found you. Like other people are saying, government is the one driving this, not coinbase.

No limit seems risky for decentralization because every full node has some limit on hard drive space. Miners get the block reward, but all full nodes need to download all that data so the incentive is not directly aligned. A powerful company or nation could flood the network with transactions causing the blockchain to grow so large most people could not store it. Imagine a 20 TB blockchain. That seems like a bad idea.

It IS clear. The RNG incident on Android left the keys completely vulnerable and predictable. Broken browser RNG just means it takes less effort to brute force. As computers increase in speed it becomes possible for someone to brute force a larger and larger number of digits meanwhile people may continue to hold bitcoins for years in addresses that were created using these low entropy RNG generators. This means a person in the future can look up the old code of say bitaddress.org, find that their entropy was weak in 2013 and do a brute force attack against that particular set of code. Even though that code is no longer active, people may still have bitcoins sitting at addresses that were generated with that code.

My understanding was that Mycelium handles this automatically by sending the change back to a new address every time you send a transaction. Since it's an HD wallet there is one master key, but virtually unlimited addresses under that.
@_date: 2015-07-28 04:35:02
So here's the deal:
Your bitcoin address is different from your public key. You can construct your bitcoin address using the public key, but you cannot construct your public key using your bitcoin address. When you send bitcoin to a specific bitcoin address, you don't need the public key, so when you first send money to a new address, the public key is not published anywhere. It's a secret that only you know as the owner of an address. When you go to spend bitcoin from this address you publish a spend transaction into the blockchain. In order for anyone to verify you are the rightful owner of this address they need to verify the signature you generate against the public key. For this reason the public key is provided as part of the transaction. In other words, in order to spend bitcoins you have to publish your public key. Here's where the danger comes in: If your public key was constructed using poor RNG someone with sufficient skills can reconstruct your private key from your public key. This is what happened in the android wallet attack:
A yet hypothetical and secondary issue is what Vitalik Buterin reported on in this article: 
Quantum computers in the future may be able to find the private key given knowledge of the public key.
So in conclusion, in most cases, assuming strong RNG, reusing an address is not dangerous, but given that new addresses are free, why would you put yourself at risk if you don't need to?

If drug research companies can't charge high rates for the drugs they develop, I believe it stifles research. Research benefits more lives in the long run.

Great interview, that said, it's pretty clear that Alex Winter doesn't really understand how Tor works and some of his statements about it were misleading. You don't use Tor to stop people from reading your credit cards while you're using Amazon. Amazon already uses encryption that blocks anyone from reading the information that you pass between each other when you're buying something. Likewise, using Tor to log onto your bank website doesn't seem all that useful. I guess you could do that if you don't want your bank to have your ip address, but it has nothing to do with protecting your bank account credentials or bank account information.

Just "The Facts"
Up until this blog post I hadn't wanted to take sides because I was not fully convinced, but their response just validated everything Olivier said. At the same time, it tried to cover it with a sugar coating. The title "The Facts About the Bitcoin Foundation" is an insult to everyone's intelligence in the Bitcoin community. Facts would be being forthright about how much smaller the head count is and how much money is really in the bank account. This post is the polar opposite of what the title purports it to be.

Just to quote from the Factom consensus paper:
"The Factom Network consists of full nodes creating a peer to peer mesh network. A full node maintains all Directory Blocks, all Entry Blocks, the Factoid Chain, the Entry Credit Chains, and server identity Chains. Notice this list does not include the Entries themselves. With this data, they can validate submitted Entry Commits before relaying them. They can also reject invalid Entry Commits. The same for Factoid transactions, and Entry Reveals.
Factom’s primary mission is to package data in a censorship resistant fashion while also resisting spam. It is not primarily intended to be a data storage mechanism. The bulk data is
shared via peers on a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). The full nodes can and for the foreseeable future will host the Entry data, but in order to lower the system requirements for running a full node, total bulk data storage of Entry data will not be required in the future."
So I wouldn't say storing info on Factom means it's preserved forever. In fact, it seems you'd need something like Amazon S3 to hold the entries unless I'm missing something.

And immutable proof-of-publication?
And trustless global notary?
And immutable proof-of-NON-publication?
And decentralized censorship-resistant database?
You're actually giving Factom credit for features that Bitcoin is providing and that Bitcoin can provide without Factom.


Bitcoin provides this, but only for digital assets. Factom also only provides this for digital documents. Take the example of a hand signed contract which is still the most common method of legal document in the world. If you scan this document twice, you get 2 different digital documents. That means you could put both of them into the Factom or Bitcoin Merkle Tree without a duplicate being detected. Therefore I really don't think Bitcoin has proof of non-publication in a practical sense, and Factom does nothing more than Bitcoin to address this.


I think it's an overstatement to call Factom a trustless global notary. It only serves as that in a future where private keys replace hand signatures and human identification methods such as showing up at a notary with your ID. Even still you have sticky issues around what happens when you lose your private key. Human intervention will be required and that's exactly what a notary public provides.
I have no investment in Factom or an alternative, but I wish people in this thread had to state if they did or not because there's a lot of hot air being blown around.

I haven't described Factom. I've described Factom without app-coins and without the need for all servers to carry all data.
There is an economic incentive in the scenario I've described. It's an alignment of incentives. I clone the data that I care about. The data that many people care about is cloned by many people. The data that nobody cares about is cloned by nobody. It's actually the same incentive provided by Factom in some ways. If I want to publish data and want to be sure that it is backed up, then I run several distributed nodes myself or pay a service to run them. The important difference is that doesn't require an app-coin. It also doesn't require those servers to carry the burden of all the data that every person paid to backup.
@_date: 2015-04-07 19:53:53
I think you're partially missing the point. Yes, perhaps Olivier's words were not exact, but the general concepts were valid: The Foundation is running out of money quickly. Most of the staff are no longer working there. The board meetings are not recorded. The organization is not transparent. You say the foundation has been pretty upfront about their financial challenges, but the response to Olivier's original post shows that the word hadn't really gotten out.
The bombshell for me is that the Bitcoin Foundation got addicted to gambling on the price of Bitcoin. For a while they had deep pockets, but when the trend flipped, they lost pretty much everything.
In comparison there are hundreds of Bitcoin startups now and I would bet that very few of them hold all their assets in Bitcoin. Why? Because that would be considered gambling and they have a fiduciary responsibility to their investors. The founders could even be sued for negligence if they lost the investor money that way.

Paul I think the issue is that the white paper goes further and says that Factom is not designed to have full nodes carry the data:
"A full node maintains all Directory Blocks, all Entry Blocks, the Factoid Chain, the Entry Credit Chains, and server identity Chains. Notice this list does not include the Entries themselves."
Secondly, your statements here don't line up with the video. The video strongly implies data is held forever. In fact it says, "With Factom you could never lose your child's birth certificate." If the primary features of Factom are not data storage and the white paper makes that point further then why is the video touting data storage as a feature?
By the way, I said "the exact opposite of a bullet-proof guarantee". I didn't say "the exact opposite of permanent storage". Your comment about a paper shredder was a straw man argument.

The reason why I cringe when I see this type of request is that the Bitcoin consensus process and ledger cannot be manipulated easily. This is a large part of what makes Bitcoin valuable. Meanwhile we also know that the communication channels that the community is currently using (reddit cough cough; bitcointalk cough cough) can be censored and manipulated. Hard forks have to be communicated to the community using these horribly censored social channels. If you can manipulate the community to accept a hard fork that they should not, you can destroy Bitcoin. Therefore, any process of encouraging hard forks, especially making them a regular part of life is making bitcoin no stronger than the flawed social channels we have to communicate. Now, if we had an immutable way to communicate with each other and everyone was using it then that would be different and maybe I could get on board with an idea like this.

I think there is room for an alternative to Factom that does not include app coins, but could provide close to the same functionality. Let's call it Lactom and here is how it would work:
A client side application creates a P2P Network that is similar to Kazaa or Limewire. When you add a document to your local data store, your client publishes a hash of your data store to the blockchain. Your client also makes that new document available on the Lactom network. If someone wants to follow your document chain, they can do so, but they do not have to follow any of them. Factom uses app coins to avoid spam, but that issue comes about because every file is treated as public and must be stored by every federated server. In the Lactom approach spam would not matter because you only listen to the chains that you wish to. For example, your local government could publish a chain of local property documents that you may want to follow.
In the example I've provided the downside is that there would be more hashes in the blockchain than with Factom, but I think you could also create some protocol where people could use Merkle Trees to share publication fees.
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:14:35
Of course. My question was assuming imperfect information, that's why I said estimate. People do know some addresses are linked to certain exchanges at this point, etc.

Yes seems likely and I think you raise a larger issue. There is no practical way to know if bitcoin hardware you receive is safe even if it looks like it hasn't been tampered with ever. For example, all of these devices are originally assembled in a factory somewhere. Someone in the factory could replace a chip with one that looks identical and appears to act identically, but steals your keys, damages the random entropy system, etc. This seems to be a huge problem for the future of Bitcoin because as the value of Bitcoin goes up, the incentive to create this type of exploit does also.

Bitcoin core has checkpoints so the majority of clients wouldn't accept the new chain
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:55:05
You can't track every single satoshi. Multiple inputs can be combined into a single output. At that point you cannot say which satoshi came from which input. Once they're mixed like that you can't separate them again and say which part came from where. It's like pouring multiple smaller cups of water into one larger cup. Once they are combined and mixed you can't provably separate them again. Even if you pour half out into another cup, who is to say where that half originally came from? Bitcoin is absolutely fungible.
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:09:29
The technology has been overstated. Every satoshi absolutely cannot be tracked. Look at [coinshuffle]( Coin tracking that I've seen on here always became speculation for the reasons I've given. With each hop it becomes less and less clear which coin came from where as the coins are mixed with other coins.
If you're talking about tracking of a large amount of coins say the coins stolen from Mt.Gox then the problem would be since the pile of coins is so large, it makes it hard to mix them effectively enough to remove the trail. You need to mix them with other large piles of coins or what generally happens is that the thief splits the large pile of coins into smaller pieces and then mixes those with other coins on the network to obscure the trail.

No they aren't. You can choose to interpret the data that way, but that's not a fact. Input balances are stored as integers. That's like saying if I have 1+1=2 and I store the 2 to disk that 0:1 comes from the first 1 and 1:2 comes from the second 1. That's nonsense. Integers don't relay any information about the equation that produced their value.

Interesting concept. What happens if you don't deposit the correct amount? Does it still go in your account or is the amount used to match the deposit with a user?

Running a node is actually very similar to voting in large elections. While it's important to encourage voting on a macro level, on a micro level your vote probably will not matter.

There's no reason to recombine the coins though so a unique value does not ever need to reoccur. That's the very concept of a bitcoin wallet. You can hold your coins at a series of addresses that appear to have no connection to eachother. The only issue with that occurs when you go to pay for something and at that point the coins combine to a single payment address, but that's already been solved by stealth addresses.

DKIM/SPF records seem like a more practical approach since GPG isn't integrated into most email clients and most people don't know how to check it meanwhile DKIM/SPF is usually supported and will cause your client to raise a red flag when something doesn't match.

How is that true? Let's say I send 1 btc to a specific address, then someone else sends 1 btc to that same address. Sure at this point they are separated as 2 available inputs at the same address.
Now I send both inputs to the same output. Now they are completely combined. How is this not fungibility? If I were to then send half of this combined input to one address and the other half somewhere else who is to say which part came from which of the original 1 btc transactions?

But what you're describing can be obscured. It's not a flaw in bitcoin it's a flaw in the way someone used it. If you know what you're doing you can hide the trail of your coins.

Awesome project how does consensus work? Is it POS, federated, POW?

Well I think my point would be a lot like [US dollar bills and cocaine]( Almost all coins would become connected and therefore dirty over time.

Nobody uses pure PoS. Checkpoints trivially resolve this issue.

You do realize that every modern fiat currency including US dollars have serial numbers on them and people run whole businesses literally for the soul purpose of laundering their money?

Who knows what will happen, but remember this was a known event and we've seen quite a price spike this year. "Buy on the rumor, sell on the news?" Meaning, the price spike we saw before the halving could have been anticipation of the event. The increased value could already be priced in.

So this is anecdotal, but I think this article is somewhat accurate. My communication with VCs is that they are looking for more traditional fundamentals from bitcoin companies vs. shoot for the moon concepts since it's becoming apparent that bitcoin is not going to achieve mainstream in 2 years. This means more investment focus on companies like Coinbase and 21 that are making money now and less on advanced bitcoin tech that requires the space to evolve at a rate that it has not. For example, there are several vc backed companies that focus on being multi-sig oracles. Bitgo is an example of this. How can those companies continue to gain investment if they can't forecast a plan to turn a profit in three years and how can they make the millions of dollars they need to when only a handful of bitcoin companies are seeing serious volume? How much can they charge their 10 large volume customers? Certainly not half a million a year each.
VCs focus on hockey stick growth and the fact is we aren't seeing that in bitcoin right now. Yes, bitcoin is still growing in transaction volume. Yes, it still has a bright future, but perhaps it will move slower than some people predicted.
Also, yes the price has negatively affected the VC market. The CEO of Coinbase even said it was hard to raise money in the down bitcoin market.

On a related note, does Ryan X Charles use his middle initial to subliminally connect himself to this guy?

They probably will have to from a legal standpoint because when the coins split they were holding balances for their clients. If they do not give those clients access to both halves of the split they are stealing.

I find it a little bit disingenuous to say "we worry that Steem can’t last" while working on what is probably considered a competitor. That's like the creator of Hotmail saying, "We're happy for Gmail's success, but we worry that it can't last." Really? You WORRY? Is it keeping you up at night? Kind feels to me like a Kanye West / Taylor Swift moment.
