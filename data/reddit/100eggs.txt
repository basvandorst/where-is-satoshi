I asked Bittrex to reset my secret key because I lost it.  Anyone know how long this typically takes?  Going on 24 hours now...

Gemini pricing is used by CBOE, I would assume, because it's most trusted by CBOE.  My concern is around the erosion of that trust if Gemini is hacked, or hosts market manipulation, etc.

CME at least uses multiple exchanges.  It seems foolish of CBOE to base its BTC price on a single exchange.  What happens if Gemini is wiped out?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:25:01
You don't think Gemini has enough influence, even if 10 futures exchanges existed, to crash the market?

Risk + Time ≠ Investing
Everyone is an expert in a bull market.
Crypto may be globally adopted and successful.  You may still lose money on BTC

Earnest question: How will adoption Bitcoin help resolve the debt problem?

Doubt it. I dont think btc has replaced gold yet at all. Right now its just speculation driven by potential adoption
@_date: 2018-04-15 04:49:08
I havent heard this. Seems random and unfounded to me. They have gone as far as saying something like, "btc is well suited to be the new gold, as a result the market cap has more to run, could go higher than just replacing the safe store if value asset"
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:22:14
As in the inverse peak representing calculated inflection point in adoption rate?

The company is called mindgeek
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:07:47
This is real. Verge currency adopted by mindgeek
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:39:03
Is this some dark web ish?
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:08:44
Not sure how much you know but most of the funds from xvg fundraising for this partnership is going to global marketing campaign re using verge on mindgeek websites. This is extremely valuable imo even if nobody actually pays for porn lol.

Oh nvm I dismissed this as flight to safety re war, didnt notice the sanctions part. My bad. I wasnt here

Its Mindgeek not just pornhub
@_date: 2018-04-17 17:03:08
Everyone is broadcasting pornhub because its the most recognizable name of mindgeek subsidiaries. Mindgeek includes pornhub, brazzers, etc. This is much bigger than just pornhub. Also, I believe payments are currently limited to one tume verge payments due to price fluctuations. Once they build up the infrastructure some more ppl can buy monthly subscriptions etc w verge also. Verge stated its exclusive adoption so verge is the only crypto you can use on their websites. Consider none of this verified but its what im basing my decisions off of

True that. Bitcoin crowdfund to audit the FED? Its a private organization fun fact

Is mainstream trying to shill cash over core?
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:10:16
But cant you still increase leverage and or create debt instruments? Part of me feels like the same rules will apply just w better tech
