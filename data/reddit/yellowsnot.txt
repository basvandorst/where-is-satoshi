The only benefit I can see is being able to access your bitcoins from any computer.

Yeah, I guess that would be faster, but I'll only be buying about $100 (USD) worth of bitcoins, so I don't think the expense of the wire transfer is justified in this case.

To clarify, from the US we should wire money to the bank in Japan? The way the website is worded makes it seem like that is only for people outside the US.

With PayPal a new user can make a small purchase nearly instantaneously with a credit card. I also don't remember it taking this long to verify a checking account with PayPal.
The point is that for Bitcoin to become widely adopted there has to be some way for consumers to quickly convert their national currency into Bitcoins. As it is, except for a few edge cases, Bitcoin just isn't worth the hassle.

I kind of assumed they would have an account in the US since they seem to be based here, but I can't find it listed on their website. It seems like they want people in the US to use Dwolla.

That may be true, but I'm not interested in bitcoins as an investment. There's just merchant I want to buy from that only accepts bitcoins, so I would like them sooner rather than later.

I already got a fraction of a bitcoin from [Bitcoin Faucet]( Of course it doesn't come close to covering what I want to buy, and mining would take a lot more time than waiting for the bank transactions to clear.

I'm not somewhere with a lot of people, in fact I'm pretty sure I'm the only redditor in town. Most of the people here aren't really into "those new computer things".
I've tried a couple of sites that allow users to trade cash for bitcoins locally, but there isn't anyone near me.
