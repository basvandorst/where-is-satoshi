I made a mistake. I had read the title a while ago and assumed it was a POS. But its actually buying and selling Bitcoin
You can see it here. Not sure is a POS is really needed to be honest once you lighting network is up. You could  probably use it just like how you would use a wallet with QR scanning. OR does POS systems do other things beside accept payment?

Its actually one of the things I wonder about is how come exchanges have not added more fiat to random_coin exchange? I think the only ones that pair are ether and bitcoin. But I think first mover advantage is huge for bitcoin. Most people have not heard of random_coin but the most likely have heard of bitcoin. Since its all over the news. When people report on cryptocurrency they usually mention bitcoin or ether along with it. Makes those 2 synonymous with cryptocurrency. Which is really making it a brand for this technology. This marketing, first mover, and its network effect are why i think bitcoin wont loose its appeal.

Ya that was weird. I guess he can't imagine how the network its self can be valued without having some big apps that are made on it that make money. But those apps are decentralized. Individuals on the network would own what ever that app does when they participate in it. The users would be the ones making the money. Like Steemit. Its a whole new financial model with Dapps. 
How much is the internet network worth? Do you just add all the value of the websites on it? or do we measure how much they sell? 
This guy wants to put a square peg into a round whole. They are very different business model. Its new type of business model. I think that you can probably measure it by looking at how much money is going into the network. Like for example if there is new version of youtube but that is decentralized. The people making videos get all the money from the ads, they own the videos, noone can censor them. They get paid for bringing in an audience and showing them some ads. You can then figure out how much money advertisers poured into that network as a whole. The video makers get paid in ether or bitcoin. They take that bitcoin they earned from the advertisers then they buy a chocolate bar. It just so happens that the advertising that is showing on their channel is a chocolate company. Rinse and repeat. Oh look at that an economy grew from that lol

His analogies are terrible. Comparing bitcoin to his finger nails is insanely stupid. Even his comparison to the Cancer cure is stupid. While you can fork bitcoin and ethereum and what ever the hell you want that is open source, doesn't mean your fork is valuable. Before Facebook became profitable its value came from its network. I can make a Facebook clone if I wanted. But since no one would use it would be worthless. Same thing with bitcoin. It seems like he does not understand this. Its the network and trust in the network that gives it its final value. Whether the current value of one bitcoin is justified by that network right now is another question, only because the amount of people using bitcoin is still low. But maybe the amount of people using it now does give it its current price. But ultimately its how many people use the network. I think the price will be even more justified once lighting is out there. Once steam and Newegg and merchants start accepting bitcoin through lighting. I mean even KFC Canada is accepting bitcoin lol. Im sure that they are well aware that bitcoin has high transactions fee at the moment. Or maybe they already have a Segwit wallet lol.
The people that MMM draws in are conservatives. I asked my brother in law today if he though again about investing into bitcoin and he responded by saying since I don't listen to his advice he wont listen to mine. That he doesn't want to talk about it anymore and that I wont convince him. He then linked me to this MMM's stupid article. Its too bad he is having this much influence on people without giving a full balanced argument. All MMM had to say for me respect his analysis of bitcoin is that  "it might not catch on and that is where the risk is coming from" I would be like ya he is right about that, but the other crap he said lol. 
He says he trusts the Federal bank to do the right thing. You had like 2 US presidents be against a central bank and they removed it only for it to come back rebranded. Its in the US constitution that money must be backed by gold BUT nope trust the central banks. 
If bitcoins value moons i'm gonna have a really hard time not saying TOLD YOU to my brother in law lol. But i'm really depending on the lighting network working :) He can say the same thing to me too if it doesn't catch on world wide. Only time will tell.

I don't understand why people say this. When you look at the what has been happening. When bitcoin takes a shit all the other coins take a shit. When bitcoin gets a hard on all the other coins take a shit lol. Doesn't that tell you something. Unless your talking about cryptos from individual countries. But just cause you build it doesn't mean people will come. It needs a network effect.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:50:03
What you should be paying attention to is the development of the lighting network. There were some big merchants who didn't want to take Bitcoin any more cause if the high transaction fees. Once lighting is 100% to go these players will get back in and more. Which will drive adoption. This will make the price go up. Ur gonna have to wait tho. Think about it this way too. Why are banks opening exchanges why is wallstreet wanting to make ETFs. why does Japan's government love Bitcoin? They see the utility of bitcoin. But these people want you to buy high and sell low so they can do it again. Look for Royal Bank of Canada analysis on cryptos its in this subforum. Even banks are saying that this industry is worth 10trillion dollars.lets say that bitcoin takes 1 percent of that. That's 1 trillion dollars market cap for Bitcoin. One coin would be 47,000. Unless you need that money asap just wait. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:29:24
Its cause there are some future contracts that are expiring on the 26th. So just like last week the price will go down so the people that shorted the Bitcoin price they will manipulate the market so it goes down and it comes true for them. They make a ton of money and then it will bounce back after a couple of days. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:16:13
well if we look at the coins out there right now. There are some that are already better than bitcoin. Why do you think this switch has not happened yet?
The way I look at it is how I look at the operating system and mobile operating systems fueds. Where a bunch of companies tried to be the system everyone uses. Windows and Mac took the majority personal computers and Apple and android with mobile. I think that there will be a max of 3 cryptos used as currency. Which ones they are is anyones guess. But I would bet bitcoin is one of them. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:09:19
For a more serious response. He is probably looking at comparing the value of gold in the world and its limited supply. Worlds gold is valued at about 7 trillion dollars. One standard gold bar is about 400k-500k grab the bitcoins that will exist 21million and divide by the 7trillion.  You get around 300k per coin. Then add the value of the general population using it. Since there is only so much of bitcoin each bitcoin becomes worth alot more. We have to remember that a large portion of the world is not using any form of banks. Bitcoin will fill this need and then the rest of the population will want some for buying things. If the lighting network is launched this year then add part of 2019 to spread quickly it can get there. I think it will probably be like 2022.

Doesn't sound right. If there is less money in the system. Then what is available in the system would then be "worth more" in terms of purchasing power. So before if a chocolate bar cost $1.00 and now there is less money then that chocolate bar would cost    $0 .50 instead. And that makes sense if you think about it. Let's say we reversed the inflation we have had in the last 100 years. By removing all the printed money. That chocolate bar would go from 5$ back to 5 cents lol. I'm not 100% if this is correct but it makes sense to me lol. What mechanism would cause it to do the opposite like you said? Why would things get more expensive if there is less money? 
Also technically then Bitcoins also inflationary cause we still mining. So which is it? Gold can't be mined forever either so just like Bitcoin it is deflationary. Unless we get some.from asteroids or something. But then its value would just plummet lol. So then let's just stick to earth gold. Cause we dealing with right now and what we have here lol. Good convo :)

it lowers the transaction fees for using the bitcoin network. Right now it costs too much money to have the record of a transaction be recorded. Especially if you want it done quickly. The faster you want that record of a transaction recorded the higher fee you have to pay. Lightning fixes this issue. Super fast transactions that cost pennies.

I can't wait until lighting is used by everyone. Once people start using bitcoin as a currency its value per bitcoin in terms of purchasing power will be super high. We wont have to deal with this market crashing shit and people manipulating anything. Note I said purchasing power/value and not price. Eventually we wont want to exchange fiat for bitcoin. Can't wait! 
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:09:55
They can buy things with Bitcoin. Another government can trade with them in Bitcoin. There would be no trail it doesn't need to be cleared through the fed or swift or anything. They send Bitcoin they get goods. The other country sells the Bitcoins they get their money. All without having it being stopped by the US. I don't think they can even track it to blame the other country for trading lol

Good altcoins lol that's funny. Even holding the top 10 coins which are considered to be blue chip tokens are all doing super shit. Haven't even recovers half of their all time highs. Altcoins won't recover until mom and pop type of people come back into it. And They got burned badly sooo who knows how long they will stay out. If it's institutions who are putting money into the market they are buying Bitcoin not some random ass shitcoins. Even Andreas Antonopoulos says they all shit. Just some good ideas to implement into Bitcoin lol.
Fyi I'm a top 10 blue chip holder. Most are taking too long to implement or seems like won't be able to deliver.

More like get into debt. Saving money is a good thing.  Wreckless spending promoted by inflation is terrible. Gives rise to throw away society. Also why spend it if you can have deflation currency and higher interest rates. This way people that want to spend can go get loans if they really want. And the people that saved their money is still being used for these loans?

Like the USD or any other Fiat or gold for that matter. It's all based on a believe system. Right now the USD has the biggest club. But it's starting to loose some members. Then you have the gold club or silver club. Before those there was the shell club. Difference this time is that I don't need someone's permission to join the club. Governments print, corporations mine gold, they can then confiscate both. But not Bitcoin you can mine it yourself and then you can literally store it in your brain if you really wanted to or needed to lol. That's super valuable!

By that measure the stock market is also a gamble. No returns guaranteed either and has crashed in the past. But you can see the general trend. more and more things developing on it. Companies making services to onboard others. Eg future contracts. Fidelity's services. NYSE releasing something too. We saw the price of one Bitcoin go to 70k in Zimbabwe. People are using this as a store of wealth. It's so obvious that it's not going to zero. Will it go crash again ? Ya it will keep doing that. There are cycles just like the stock market. Which has also crashed many times now. people still buying back in.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:46:31
I don't think they would be able to trace it back to the countries though. You can't tell where a Bitcoin was mined and sold as far as I know. Plus I'm sure funding those people happens using cash or gold or something else now which can't be traced now either. So it really makes no difference for that. Bitcoin for Iran is more about the general population in Iran and them being able to eat and prosper still. Bitcoin is for them! Can't use a scare tactic of ohhhh the terrorists for ever. You sound like a politician scaring people out of Bitcoin lol.
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:50:57
Lifting people out of poverty was caused  by the industrial revolution and being more productive along with development in technology. Also Having something useful to sell. It was only in the 70s we got off the gold standard which can be said is deflationary. Can't print more gold  its supply is fixed. So I wouldnt attribute poverty reduction to inflationary currencies. 
Bitcoin won't keep useless corporations or businesses alive. Right now there are a ton of zombie companies around the world that can't their interest payments are more than the revenue they make. They are being propped up by money printing (inflationary currencies). At the expense of everyone holding cash. While yes not everyone has jumped into Bitcoin. So there will be people that own a lot more. They will eventually get some.  Price discovery will happen for things really quickly. People will still buy houses, cars food, random shit they want in Bitcoin. So the economy still flows. People have to live, eat survive. So there will still be spending. 
As for transaction fees. This is solved by lightning network. Won't be an issue.

If we have another economic collapse like 2008 all the occupy wall street people will be on this world wide. You are dealing with peoples money and immediate lively hood then it can arouse people very quickly. There is a reason millennials like bitcoin. When we graduated from university it was the worst economy to graduate into. It had a pretty big trickle effect of having no job or a shitty job for a long time. No money to save etc etc.  Its still fresh in people minds I think. If they forgot they will quickly remember since these recessions happen every 10 years or so and we are due for some kind of reminder. Lets see them try to regulate/ban it and then a recession happens lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:20:52
There are already decentralized exchanges. One is made using etheruem smart contracts.  Also people can send bitcoins by mail or text message using a random alphanumeric code that has the the transaction signed and that says who the recipient is. This all with out adding your private keys which makes it secure. They really can't stop it. Even if they wanted to kill decentralized currencies it would probably also become a political thing. One candidate for Bitcoin. People vote for them problem fixed. Banning exchanges would more likely slow down its growth until the next economic collapse. Then people would freak out and want them back up or the decentralized ones would take off like crazy. People saying they can control vendors excepting cryptos is crazy lol. They can't even control drug dealers getting paid and its a smaller part of "commerce" 
@_date: 2019-07-26 02:05:12
Transparency and Network effects is it's value. Like all currencies it needs the users to believe it has value. Whoever is currently participating in the Bitcoin system as a whole have decided it's useful and worth around 10k (at this moment). The longer it holds value like this the more it legitimizes. Bringing in more people that also believe it has value. Boom now u have a new accepted unit of account and currency. It's interesting to watch non believers turn into believers. Just look at that old dude on CNBC lol. He hated Bitcoin then questioned it. Now he defends it lol. Bitcoin as an idea alone is crazy strong.

I would definitely tell them about it. You are gonna have to explain it to them. If you can trust them not to steal it or something stupid like that I would also explain to them how they can recover your crypto currencies in case something happens to you. Sorry for being a bit morbid but if you passed away or had some sort of accident. They would have no recourse on getting these cryptos back. I know I would want my family to have the money. Since there is no bank to show them you were related or anything like that your coins can be lost forever. You know what I mean. So I would tell them about it. Also explain HODL lol So they dont sell right away. Hope that helps a bit
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:54
You should think about it in terms of purchasing power. As the FIAT value drops in purchasing power bitcoins would get higher. You can already see this with the story of the guy who bought a pizza with 10,000 bitcoin. Now no one would buy a pizza for that much they would instead use what ever amount of satoshi a pizza is worth. So if we look more into the future and everything with bitcoin worked out you can buy a house with a 3rd of a bitcoin or .5 of a bitcoin. So people that hold are gonna be just fine.

@_date: 2018-05-07 07:07:25
I think it does. People aren't as nervous about their future because of the social benefits given in Scandinavian countries.  I would say you guys are ahead of the times. Seeing how most people agree that a lot of jobs are getting automated and that we need some sort of universal income to help people out. You guys are very close to that it wont be such a huge jump compared to the US where they dont give a shit about their own people and then suddenly they need to give them universal income. Even Elon Musk says this is needed and it will happen. In the next 25 years probably. 
Also you should not confuse communism with socialism. Socialism is an economic system, Communism is both economic and polical(and usually not democratic). Socialism still supports Capitalism you just get taxed more but it creates social cohesion, Communism doesn't like capitalism you don't own anything. VERY VERY different.

Well it's from their BIS website but it was also on he max keiser report he spoke about it. BIS is pretty much the central bank for the central banks. Ur also thinking about it the wrong way. They will use it as collateral asset for loans. Which is essentially gold back currency lol. And the value if their total gold is going to be revalued. If they say oh now it's worth 200$ an ounce then they made a ton of value out of thin air even with the gold. Maybe they will go to market value then it's a shit ton money. Remember that the us is the country with the most amount of gold in the world. So for now they can print money and get stuff for free like gold, work from workers for fiat and when if this whole money printing shit show implodes they reset to gold and bitcoin. They will still be a rich country cause they have a ton of gold. If u want to see it on max Kaiser report it was like 5 episodes ago or so. No body on the major news companies are reporting it. But the last time gold was a reserve asset at the BIS was in the 70s when the us went off the gold standard. Now it's going back on BIS so that is very telling isn't it.

Not sure if u heard about BIS basal 3 rules that it now makes gold as a reserve asset. It turns out that the gold that countries around the world have are priced at the price when they were purchased if I remember correctly the US has it at around 40$ an ounce. What these guys will do is the will now revalue the price of the gold they have. All.of sudden the us now has waaaay more money that they said they did. Which can be used to back their currency and reomve some debt. People don't realize that we are secretly going back to a gold standard. This is another lever these guys using. I blows my mind the amount of manipulation that these guys are capable.of

For a lot of.people Its hard to buy things. my purchasing power has dropped a lot. I bought at 12k so I would be throwing that away if I bought anything. Hopefully it goes up just so people can break even. Even in terms.of using it as a currency. If it goes up to the 20k it was at and it stablized there then a lot of people would be happy.  
@_date: 2018-10-17 00:29:43
No its more than that. When you buy using market price instead of putting a buy order at certain price for it, it goes through what ever is in the sell order book to complete the sale. This means that if you do a market buy for 1000$ worth of Bitcoin and there are 2 sell orders you will get fullfilled first by the cheapest then by the next most expensive until your 1000$ are gone. 
If you do it the other way and set a price of a certain amount its the sellers that have to meet your price for a certain amount.
It the difference between you dictating how much  you will spend for a certain amount of coin vs just buying at what ever the price people are throwing out there is. It can save you a lot more money or you get more crypto for your money. It takes a bit more patience though cause you need to wait for the sellers to match what you want to buy for. 
I hope I explained this in way you can understand let me know LOL

"Millennials have also been forced to shell out hundreds of billions of dollars in rent as housing costs have skyrocketed in many urban areas. This represents a large generational transfer of wealth from the young to the old. Boomers own the houses and bar municipalities from building more of them, thus benefiting from rising prices and soaking up endless rent checks forked over by younger and poorer families."

US dollar is starting to lose its power though. Yuan backed oil futures that  then can be settled in gold. The reason USD got strong was cause it was tied to the trade of oil. If you wanted to buy oil you had to get USD. Which means you had to trade something of value for those dollars. So the fed turns on the printing press prints paper and gets real goods. The country takes those rpinted dollars and purchases the oil. This is how most trade got to be settled in USD . Now the USA has a Challenger in this system, oil settlements in Chinese Yuan. This Yuan can then be converted into gold. This is a huge blow to the American dollar.

This doesn't apply to Bitcoin  and the reason it doesn't is because of the timing (which happens to be why Bitcoin was created in the first place. I read an article about a Japanese investor he was talking about the dangers of the cheap money and governments doing negative rates and negative bond yeilds. His insights come from what has happened in Japan which has had negative rates and printing and governments buying everything for some time. Since then returns on investments has become so low he said that Japanese investors have started investing Into riskier things. They are looking for return on investments. This will happen to the rest of the markets so people will be putting money into it . Funds looking to make or keep money.  The chances of at least 1% of the world's wealth going into is not low.

False  its value does come from those things. There is a reason the main stream media talks about Bitcoin more than anyother crypto currency. One of the main reasons is it's security (I'm not talking about security in illegally activity context which has already been debunked criminals don't use btc as much as people think, they use Montero) I'm talking about securing the ledger/transaction history. No other chain has that amount of computer power behind it. It has the biggest network effect out of all the other shitcoins out there. It has brand recognition. For these reasons It has the most amount of money being poured into it which makes it even more valuable. It doesnt matter that there are competitors. They will struggle to create this network effect that has developed over 10 years. I can launch a Bitcoin too call it coinbit or a Facebook clone bookface . No one is gonna give a shit about it. 
Remember when Google tried to launch a Facebook competitor? Aka a network.... Are you on Google plus?? If I build it they will come doesn't work lol.
 
Will there be more than one blockchain? ya I think so but for storing value and transfering it. As an actual decentralized blockchain. Highly probable that it will be Bitcoin people will turn to. Will people use Facebook coin Libra ya maybe probably but that's really just another Fiat system. It's practically WeChat pay on steroids. Did WeChat pay kill Bitcoin in China..nope people in China love Bitcoin lol.

Cash on its own doesn't produce wealth either. What he really means is that other currencies that are just fiat will lose their purchasing power. Nobody will want to deal with fiat currency. Like Venezuela nobody wants their money it has no value. If people change to Bitcoin as a main way of trading value and if you had some Bitcoin then you can become wealthy in that sense. Cause people would recognise Bitcoin as actual money more and more. My question has more to deal with how price discovery happens when you change a money system. Like for example milk right now costs $ 3. If we didn't use fiat as a reference point how much would the same amount of milk cost? 3 satoshis??

OK so you don't seem to really understand what Bitcoin really does. Let's pretend that there is no money  in the world and people don't have any concept of money but the only thing that we have is Bitcoin but it's not attached to any sort of Fiat currency. Can I eat it?? Drink it? Nope. Now let's say we wanted to keep track of something. But I don't trust you or anyone else too keep track in an honest way. Bitcoin still fulfills this purpose even without it being attached/compared to any sort of currency. Bitcoin is just a really fancy accounting system. So even without the market value you say it has. It is still an amazing tool for trustless accounting. Right now it's tracking/accounting for Fiat maybe in the future it will track goats lol. 
So by your own definition it has inherent value. Checkmate ��lol jk jk :)
Also a lot of things don't have the trustless system of Bitcoin that's why it wins

If you listen to Peter shief he talks about how the next crisis we will have will be a debt default crisis that we have never seen before or we will have a currency crisis caused by the crazy debt people/countries have. The ability to control inflation is running away from central banks. They can't increase interest without companies and countries Being unable to even just pay the interest on loans. So they will print money to pay the debt which will cause crazy inflation. They are already printing Money to stimulate the economy. Which is causing inflation which again they can't control. So damned if they do damned if they don't. Don't you think it's weird that countries are buying up gold like crazy. It was on the news that a country bought a shit ton of gold(don't remember the number) and the last time that country bought that amount of gold was when we were still on the gold standard. It kinda points out that we are probably gonna slip back to the gold standard and when all the readily available gold has Been bought they will need another store of value that can't be faked. Probably Bitcoin. I do wonder how much less economies grow withoit it all being fuelled by debt. Interesting and scary times! 
@_date: 2019-02-09 09:18:37
I think people would use it as a currency for their necessities. Particularly if a hyperinflation situation occurs in the main worldwide currencies. Euro, USD, yen etc. People would rather receive something that keeps its purchasing power and goes up in power. If you think about it  incentivises people to save money. Our debt based economy hasn't really worked out for most people. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:01:19
No inherent value. That means you don't understand Bitcoin. Its value comes from its security, being able to transfer value without a 3rd party, it's a currency and a network at the same time. Whether these things are "worth/valued" at it's current market rate is another discussion. But you can't say it has no inherent value. It's like saying the internet has no inherent value.

You seem to forget what is happening world wide with currencies and interest rates.  4 countries in Europe are in negative rates. They pay you to borrow money. Once it hits savings accounts you will pay the bank to keep your money lol. Italy has started to talk about taxing people's savings accounts and vault holdings with gold etc etc. They are even thinking about selling a new kind of bond of government debt. Which is essentially a new Italian currency. Which signals the euro is wobbly.  If they go through with it it will signal other countries. The US has weaponized the USD blocking countries from getting access to it if they don't follow the rules. Everyone is talking about a gold backed currency and China Russia India buying gold up like crazy. They will  still want to use something digital and Bitcoin mimics gold. So fiat is slowly failing.  Bitcoin and gold will be around. With Bitcoins also getting more scarce it will drive price up pretty quickly.

They will certainly come up with some excuse to remove you and raise it. If the landlords money isn't buying as many things as before then they will try to get more out of their assets. Put your self in the landlords shoes if you are getting rent and your money doesn't buy what it used to what would you do? Always look at things from both sides. Even with legal agreements are there any ways around that? People do it all the time. They see that their area is commanding a higher price now for rent. Then they make up some bullshit excuse. That they want to live in the house they take it off the market for like 2-3 months then they "changed their mind" now its back on the market with a new price.

There is more than one world reserve currency. Its not just the USD. Slowly it will be replaced in terms of percent. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:29:18
I don't think its the next day its dead type of scenerio. Its more about  them killing it with hyperinflation money printing to pay off their debt. Once they start doing that people won't value USD like they did before. You for sure you  can still get paid in USD but If the inflation gets out of control when you get paid that money they just gave you the next week won't buy you as much as it did the week before. Your rent will change every month. The price of things change through out the day. That's where  Bitcoin and gold become useful again and more so in Bitcoin cause you can send it to people easily. Peoples preference on what they get paid in will change. Like in Venezuela people would.much rather be paid in USD than their own currency. But if the USD is not valued as much then people will want to be paid in something else. Probably not the euro cause that might implode too and paying in gold is not convenient. So either the government says they will turn back to the gold standard or people will just not listen to that and Bitcoin will take its place. I think people dismiss the hyperinflation thing cause they don't realize what is happening right now. The banks can't increase interest rates too much or they will cause the debts of companies and countries to be unpayable. But if they don't don't increase rates then inflation gets too high. If the interest rates go up to service the debt the governments will start to print money which again causes inflation. Its pretty crazy the situation that governments and banks have put them selves in. This is the only reason I still believe in Bitcoin. I'm actually starting to think that the us government might have invented it lol. As a way to take a shit on world currencies as they see the writing on the wall. They pay for their debt through printing. Grab as much Bitcoin as possible. When fiat currencies collapse including the Yuan. The states stay a rich country lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:40:04
I think the real value of Bitcoin only comes out if it turns into an actual global competitor to the USD. Bitcoin was created after the GFC. But what I realized after listening to Peter Shiff was Bitcoin actually needs another GFC to really take off. Peter speaks about how he thought that most things would not be bailed out and that the government would fail to reinflate all the asset bubbles. But he says that they succeeded in reinflating them. He goes on to say that the next GFC will be a currency and bond crises. Which makes sense to me. World governments are struggling to increase interest rates. A lot of them have printed money which causes inflation. To control inflation you increase rates. But companies and governments can't afford the interest payment if it goes up. So if they want to increase rates and pay the interest it will crash markets and the  printed money to pay it again causes inflation. So I think that is the real way we see bitcoins real value. No one will trust central issued money. I'm not sure when this happens tho. It seems to be happening now perhaps. stock markets keep going down. Housing is on its way down too. And on the news people are taking about zombie companies that their revenue doesn't even cover their interest payment . We shall see. Very interesting time to be honest. In no other time.in history have we had a currency that wasn't decided on by higher authority monarch, government etc. Bitcoin can really be the peoples money. Which is a pretty facinating thing just on that alone.

Next economic collapse according to economists will be a currency and bond crises. I don't think the government can fix the economy in the next crashing with out destroying the USD. When this happens people won't want dollars. Either the gold standard comes back or people realize that unlimited printing is not good and see crypto as a way to protect themselves. Its already happening in Venezuela. And before you say ya they are try to use Bitcoin as way of saving USD. You have to realize that this collapse will kill off the USD. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 00:54:16
Lol I do remember. What I'm wondering now though is if institutional money is coming in, that the markets will become more and more correlated. Cause of human behavior like you said. These big fund traders commanding large amounts if bitcoun can move the market if the stock market is going down and they are in the Bitcoin market they will freak out in the Bitcoin market as well causing it to go down. But this might depend on how much these guys hold vs the general public. I'm still convinced of the general trend that Lee talks about though. About crypto and bitcoin being the big investment vechile for millennials his demographics research is pretty interesting. But its definitely hard trying to see the bigger picture when the prices drop like this. I already put in quite a bit of money at 12k price point so I'm really down. So with me this new monetary system takes off or it goes to zero. This crash definitely scared off a lot of people but people forget pretty easily. Most have forgotten the GFC and what caused it and we doing the same thing. I think it will take a currency crisis to get Bitcoin to take off. Which might happen now that governments are stuck with the mess they made. Increase rates and make countries and companies bankrupt or don't increase rates and have hyper inflation destroying the dollar. Or increase rates and then money print to pay off the interest hich also destroys the dollar. Then boom Bitcoin is now worth a lot again. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:40:50
Our last recovery was fake. That's the whole point. The recover was based on money printing and keeping rates at pretty much zero. Which is not a normal economy. It wouldn't have recovered in 2-4 years. Which is why Everytime they talk about raising rates they freak out. Cause they know the growth wasn't really there. These guys really messed up they are stuck. They will have to sacrifice something to get out if this situation and its gonna be the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:51:09
The US has weaponized the dollar and they them selves are destroying it by printing. Countries wont want to get paid in USD dollars but in gold. Gold in a digital age isn't very useful way to transact. We also have the EU, russia, china wanting and developing an alternative to the swift system. They are also hoarding and buying up gold? Why do you think that China has now launched oil traded and priced in the Yuan?? The dollar is on its way out. Its not delusion its happening as we speak lol. Even if bitcoin didn't exists. The dollar is on its way out.  History also shows us given enough time fiat currencies implode. Can't you see the general trend? You should read the news a bit more and think about how all the different news articles fit together and are related. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:03:06
I don't understand why you would think that people's need to buy things would suddenly stop. If the government collapses or economy tanks. People will need to use something they trust to transact in. If the faith in USD/fiat is diminishing people won't accept it. They could accept Bitcoin.

Most true Bitcoin believers are waiting for higher adoption. For people to really start adopting it on mass. To be a real financial competitor to world currencies and gold. That hasn't happened yet. But it will. So people don't want to sell it for Fiat. They are waiting for people in general to start accepting Bitcoin as a formal method of payment. Just like the internet took some time to be adopted and used by most households Bitcoin will take some time too. So no need to sell it but exchange it for goods priced in bitcoins. That is when the early adopter will be rewarded. That's what we are waiting for and its definitely coming.

Don't sell man u will regret it if it goes up drastically. You should be able to get away with buying a 5 year old car.

For rent try going them 3 months max that should be enough if you have someone your really trust get them to help you sign for it as well Like ur mom. Just don't fuck her over by messing her credit lol.

That is a not a real economy they cant do that forever. Do you think they can hold rates at record lows and print money forever?  Real question. Through out the world politicians come in and say tax cuts for everyone. Every one is happy yay lower taxes. But then they turn on the printing press.

If it takes off its because people don't trust their monitary system anymore and will start using something that is not issued by the government or central bank. You can see this happening now in Venezuela. The next financial crisis will be caused by debt and currency. Probably started now with the stock markets crashing. Most people don't realize how interest rates are tied to inflation and the value of the currency. Mix that with the huge amounts of debt and the Governments are stuck in a bad feedback loop. If they don't increase rates inflation gets out of control. If they do increase it countries and companies can't service the debt/interest. They turn to money printing to pay the debt which causes inflation. People will see this and not want to partake in this system anymore like Venezuela. People will turn to gold and Bitcoin.

That's how it will make its way into the economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:11:47
I completely agree. What most people don't realize is that the over all economy is gonna take a massive shit. Countries are full of debt, people are full of debt. Governments are gonna be screwed. So much debt and such low interest rates. If the economy collapses they have 2 choices print more money(for stimulus/bailouts) which makes your dollars worth less(inflation) or increase interest rates which will then cause people to declare bankruptcy. Its literally one of these choices no other choice. This is already the second longest bull market for the stock market. So it will happen. People will say but if the markets crashes then people will pull out the money from bitcoin cause they want cash. But remember that if they print more money for bailouts massive inflation everything will seem to get more expensive( but really its that you need more dollars to buy the same thing cause they are worth less). What I think will happen is people will start using bitcoin as the currency that it was intended to be. So stop thinking about it in terms of how many dollars can I get for this bitcoin and start thinking about it in terms of how much is my purchasing power increasing in bitcoin. I just hope lighting in battle tested by then. Once this happens it will be accepted everywhere as a currency. This will happen within the next 5 years.

Also look at stripes terms and conditions it says they dont do business with currency exchange type of businesses. You got away with it for a bit so be happy about that. Take your profit and invest it into a payment portal that deals directly with the banks. or do the transactions by hand getting direct deposits into your business bank account with an identifier(using the transaction description) for that transaction(id comes from your system) compare that to the the identifier(they submitted) with the bank description. If they are both the same then ur good to go. That ID for that user corresponds to that person wallet address. send them bitcoin and ur back in business. Just make sure that ur signed up as a money transmitter business or ur gonna get into trouble. They are looking to make an example of people. Better to be safe.

Not sure whey people say this is a bad thing. People now have a shit ton of debt. Cryptos that are deflationary make people save their money.

How can you lose money trading ? If you buy high and sell low is the only way right? Does that mean if you day trade and it doesn't go up you just hold that until it gets back to that level? The reason I'm asking is if you really believe in Bitcoin then you hold that until it goes higher then original purchase price or at break even. I don't really see a lose here besides maybe tying up funds if it goes down. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:47:05
The change from Fiat to Bitcoin will be gradual not abrupt. What this means is that the 21 million bitcoins will spread out through the world. This causes the "value" of each full  Bitcoin to be very high. We won't be dealing in terms full bitcoins. Like you are suggesting. We will be dealing in satoshis. 21,000,000,000,000,000 this is 21 quadrillion satoshis. The entire world debt is 233 trillion I think we will be fine cause right now the entire world physical money supply is 31 trillion  You are worrying about the entire supply being lent out and then the debt being called all at the same time which won't happen. Also there are other assets that people have that they can sell to pay loans. What I think will happen is we  will have a worldwide credit score that is kept on a block chain if you fuck that up no  one will lend to you. But again there are just too many  satoshis. But really its none issue. I think a bigger issue is I lend you 1 Bitcoin at 1000$ then you spend it and the Bitcoin value goes to 7000$ you need to pay me back my Bitcoin its cost has changed drastically. Maybe the terms for payment are at minimum you have to pay back the full Fiat value and more like 3000$ back but then he made out like a bandit making  an extra 4000$. Not sure about this one lol.

Like I said in my post you seem to think is fiction they only have 2 solutions print money or increase rates which will fuck everything (people will default on their loans just like they did in the housing market in 2008). Or they can just take ur life savings(bail-in). So buying bitcoin is not a bad idea. The Greek now use crypto to hide their money.

Google Cyprus and Greek bail in. Too lazy? Tldr version. Banks were collapsing instead of being "bailed out" like they did in the US they got "bail in" which meant they took peoples money straight from their bank accounts.
Bitcoin allows you to control your own money. What I find weird is that after the 2008 collapse a lot of governments made bail in laws. You should look at the laws for it in your country. Doesn't it say something that they pass these laws. Its like they are getting prepared for another finicial collapse to happen.

Can't people get together for a class action lawsuits? For deceptive practice of selling an asset or investment for something its not. If people want Bitcoin but they buy bshit and bshit goes to zero but people thought they bought Bitcoin. Isn't that deceptiveness fraud?

He worries about 51% attack. I heard Andre say that its extremely costly and risky. That it actually pays more to be honest. But im not sure about nation's or governments they might not care about costs to try to take it down.

Bitcoin does consume a lot of power but people forget about the amount of power that is required to power our current banking system. Debit terminals, credit card infrastructure, printing money (all the material involved in that), minting coins(which by the way in the US cost more to make a penny than its purchase power lol).  
The poverty problem might also be solved by bitcoin as well. One reason governments love fiat is due to the fact that you can fund the military with endless amounts of printed money. Look Britain stopped backing the pound with gold during world war 2 cause they were running out of gold. If they ran out completely then they would have lost the war. Instead it dragged on for years killing more people cause they payed with paper. Maybe instead of taxing people and spending it on the military they would spend it on the people who need it. Like the housing I said above. People really just need food, housing, and their own sense of purpose and most people are fulfilled. Consumerism has taught people that their purpose is to work and collect stupid things they don't need. Bitcoin kinda stops this by making people save money which also increases people wealth which reduces poverty.

Yes we just buy what is required to live. Food.  government can then regulate shelter prices. Why do we need loans after that?

Why aren't people talking about the the use of tether to pump the market? Anyone watch cryptochico on this whole thing? He says that the investigation into tether and its company will be behind a big pump before the get in trouble. He has some tape of whales talking about getting the exchanges to pump it?
Or how about the Japanese whale that crashed the market last time when they dumped coins? Anyone know how many more he has? Might happen again that they dump it?

So you think fractional reserve banking is really working? The banking system seems like it can collapse any second. The fed just had to call up the heads of the banks to make sure they were liquid enough lol. The banking system has made a few people very rich. But it seems like the way they are run now doesn't work. Alsoa debt based society hasn't really worked out either. Its created a fake economy where the growth just comes from money printing and low interest rates. Only if we go back to normal lending which is backed by actual reserves and paying the lenders proper interest would it work. To do that we don't need fiat that can be printed on the whims of a few old men. I would rather have it be run by a network secured by math thanks. Bitcoin doesn't need fiat.

Ur in my situation lol. The reason I feel like shit is cause I wish I had waited for this type of drop I would be able to purchase more. Thats the only shit feeling I get lol. I didn't dollar cost average in. But if I did that I would have paid even more on the way up lol. O well lol.

China increasing tarrifs and also saying they might dump treasury bonds. Right when they announced this it went up 500$ pretty much.

I think people will flee to both and the reason is that our economy is very digital now. commerce is moving from physical to e commerce more and more. So people still need something digital to transact in. When people call bitcoin digital gold it makes sense to me. Only time will tell i guess. I feel like holding everything is your best bet. Buy some bitcoin, buy some gold.... not sure what else to buy to cover your ass lol.

Don't think about it as an investment then. Think about it as a hedge against a current system that is reducing your purchasing power through money printing. I think our current monetary system will collapse. We will then use both gold and Bitcoin as stores of value and to transact.

The reality is that the world governments have killed their only way to control inflation which is through manipulating interest rate. If they raise rates it will completely destroy the markets. If they don't increase it then they can't control inflation. The amount of debt that countries and companies have is really high. Increasing rates will cause a lot of them to default on debt. They are unable to even pay the interest payments(look up zombie companies). To fix this the governments will print money to pay debt which again causes inflation. They will need to sacrifice something either the world economy or currencies. That is the reality.  They are trying to increase the rates now and people are losing their minds. Economy cant handle it. If you can tell me how they will save world currencies that would be interesting to learn.

It wont need to be a mad Max type of collapse. I'm taking about just really bad Inflation due to the world wide monitary policies, that have really destroyed the central banks ability to do anything in the next economic crisis. Specifically their ability to increase interest rates. Increases in interest rates is their only tool to control inflation. But we can see what has been happening. They start To increase rates and the market starts to crash. Countries and companies have too much debt. increase rates  and then they can't even make the interest payments. Look up zombie companies. If they dont increase rates we have bad inflation. If they do increase rates  we have massive defaults on banks and companies. Countries will start to print money to pay the debt which again causes Inflation. These guys really messed up. I'm not just talking about the US. Europe and asian countries have done the same thing. So it won't be a USD dollar vs insert other world currency to take over. They are all in a really bad position and ready to implode. This is where Bitcoin and gold will come in. Both will be used as a store of value but one will be used as  a way to transact quickly as well. People will still want to save it cause it goes up in purchasing power/value but this is not a bad thing I think it forces people to spend only on necessities. We have seen how a debt based society has not been working. Edit Grammer.

he said they weren't before, but he says now that correlation has changed. he goes by data not opinions. so his data is probably showing correlation now.

Don't futures have to have a buyer and a seller? One thinks it will go up and the other down? The only thing that is causing futures to be used to manipulate to me seems that people can just dump Bitcoin and cause the market to crash. Which makes the shorts make more  when they feel.like it. In the stock market if its crashing they pretty much stop trading. Not sure if there is a  about that for te stock market  Anyone know about that? 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:57:19
you need to stop thinking about it in terms of USD. What can also happen is people will just start to price things in BTC/Satoshis. they wont want to hold on to USD cause it would be losing purchasing power caused by inflation. people would want something that can't be printed but can also be transacted in digitally like bitcoin. When this happens Bitcoin is no longer a speculation tool but a tool for actually transacting in. This is what hodlers are waiting for. This scenario  seems more and more likely all the time.
