Square pay. Pretty sure your " barber " is not doing $50k per month. So square will cut fees way down, and not eliminate an entire customer base. This guy have a website we can visit?

Wtf? I bought aapl because fools love the overpriced tech. It has since split and gone up over 600% in USD. Not at all because I support a cause. You dont invest with your heart, you invest with your head. I love my gopro, but there is no way i would buy their stock. A fool and his money will soon part, isnt that a saying?

I have. Nowhere does it talk about fees. There are a lot of words, but no numbers.  Until you see the cost, how can you make a decison? Do they expect you to just give them money and see the charge later?

Nope, otc is a 20% premium if you are refering to localbtc.... Anyone smart enough to have the money to be an "institutional investor" wont pay that much over spot pricing elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:51:26
But people dont buy btc with bakkt, its custodial, so they are giving money to an institution with the agreement that they buy on their behalf. They dont have keys, they dont have a number of btc, they are just getting a possible % of the return if decide to sell their stake. Or am i reading what they are saying their plan is incorrectly.

Reddit is seemingly getting more liberal with their bans. Its like every sub has to be a happy perfect place. I get the rude/disrespect thing, thats not cool. But there is no reason to have to agree with every post that gets posted. The front page is becoming more like NK. Disagree with the cuteness of a puppy? Banned. Dont like the scenery of my yoga retreat? Banned. You dont support me in my one sided story of a whacked out relationship? Banned.

DCA can be seen as suckers money to many traders. Specifically if the asset is dying.

Hard to see a correlation? Dow is up today, btc is up today. Its pretty simple. You can cherry pic whatever dates and random prices you want to make your point valid though, thats the coiners motto. But back to what op said, btc is doing the inverse of the stock market. And its clearly not.
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:55:50
how will they determine how much you earn? What is the expense ratio? they will have a ton of expenses in the example you put forward. Since only a few btc are mined per day, and being thrown in a vault, that takes them straight out of the publics hands and reduces the volume available to use in the real world. This would eliminate its use as a currency, would it not?

So in theory. Btc = 10,000. You lend one out. Btc moons over night to 100,000. I repay with 0.1 btc (because that's the 10,000 value). I now have 0.9 btc left.  Btc drops back to 10,000 the next day. Dude i paid on has 1000 value of btc. I still have my 0.9 btc valued at 9000.

Because they lose money converting to fiat. So why accept it, if it loses them money. Thats simple economics. But you will say, then they should just hold. But that doesnt work because they have a supply chain to pay that doesnt accept btc. So unless they have unlimited credit or funding, they are basically just trading and holding. And that doesnt put food on anyones table. And that will only work for so long, if they cant replace their product, because noone accepts btc.

FUD! You must be a paid btc troll. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:31:41
If you live paycheck to paycheck, sure. Do you have an investment account you can dip into for those deals that just cant wait?
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:44:16
Considering its $50 per month, and the live shots show profits of $0.08 per trade. Maybe start with like $40k
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:09:09
Not really. I know several people that have been banned for it.

Total silence from bakkt since late october when approval was to happen the first week of november. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:29:05
If its a currency, its never too late. It will be stable and not about gains. So in your world, only smart people buy btc, everyone else is "stupid". Must be tough waking up to a world with 7.699 billion stupid people in it. You are a stronger person than i. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:22:55
You dont. Simple. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:35:05
So do you also tell them btc can lose 40% of its value in a week?  Or do you tell them not to invest more than they can afford to lose? Come on man. You are posting with a 40 year old that is working towards retirement, nothing you say makes me want to buy btc. You should listen to u/thephysicist.  I think its one of the few posters here that understands that there is more than one world view. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:14:21
So is there any more of an incentive?
@_date: 2018-11-04 13:51:25
Wrong headline. Should say, illegal passports sold for bitcoin.

Its comical here. Makes me feel great about buying the fuck out of the facebook ipo, netflix almost a decade ago, and apple back in 2002. I never want to miss out on an opportunity, and i dont think i am. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:34:31
By media, do you mean people in the this sub? Becaude its been posted here more than ive seen anywhere else. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:13:17
Awww I'll take that as a happy 40th from De_ dust. Are we having a moment? I wont tell my wife. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:24:20
He didnt want to tell me anything. Hes probably a whale trying to keep btc down so he can buy at these low prices. I see right through it though. I bought a dozen btc this morning inspite of him. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:18:40
Modeling and methodology is just speculation with lines. Past does not dictate future. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:35:13
Why would anyone need a btc loan? Btc doesnt buy anything fiat cant. How are the repayment terms? Percent of price loaned? It is in btc repayment? Is it variable? I would love to know your repayment plan. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 14:21:22
I know. But it was the same trip for us. Somethings you cannot explain to your wife, you just gotta roll with it.

This guy works for bakkt
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:35:39
Because these guys think they can down vote reality and turn this thing around. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:47:35
Agreed. If everyone was their own bank, ww would all be competing against each other with our btc rates. Same reason localbtc is garbage, there are still people trying to offer 6k btc in my area. Lol. No thanks, there will always be a better "bank"
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:08:23
So do the opposite of what 90% of the coiners do?  Dont buy, and win? 
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:51:46
It plans to sell, there is currently no buyer. And said buyer is an entity buying a company that has lost almost $200 million this year. Better be a good deal. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 00:42:09
Lol. Why would a non tech person do something techy. Kinda counter intuitive.

You are right. My degrees are in nursing. Almost done with my doctorate!!!! You can get your scripts for depression from me. J/k im part of a wound care group. You can pay me to clean your pressure wounds from not getting off the couch, but i only accept USD. So that may be an issue.

Another machine you can put fiat into and watch disappear! This is great for btc!
@_date: 2018-11-02 19:32:25
But how? How will this help? Are people just going to send them wealth for no reason? Saying that the whole of africa will become a level playing field by clicking buttons and crypto trading is just crazy talk. Sure its fun to type that, but in reality, it wont work. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:39:12

@_date: 2018-11-14 22:49:13
So use all your coin, and buy more at this new low price if the price is of no concern. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:13:53
This is the best entertainment on my phone.
@_date: 2018-11-06 02:14:55
Correct. Banks make will make money off people trying to make money in btc. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:47:01
Fdic. What are you worried about? You keeping 250k in a savings account? Lol. Im not unpmeasant. Im quite pleasant, im just not a doomsday guy like yourself. My world is bright, sunny, and not at all worried about losing money to a run on banks, and my county going into default. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:48:23
Not if the cost is fixed. Maybe the ARMs get jammed. But i dont play that game.

@_date: 2018-11-23 21:37:18
So the 12 people that question btc on this sub affect the price, but the million that lost actually money don't? You going to go asking every person how they feel and try to censor them to?

Deadass? Yeah, probably. Its like "legit". Im 40, and not edgy.

Wow is not an answer. What will cryototrading do to level the playing field. You said it, please answer 
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:13:19
Lots of typing, but no answer yet. Well done. You realize early adoption of btc happened about 10 years ago? Now its late adoption. And theyve been using m-pesa since 07. Ide say they arent behind in any financial tech, we are. And its about being your own bank right? We want to be unbanked according to the btc white paper. So basically, you think that if all of africa just goes all btc, they become wakanda? Please pass whatever you are smoking. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:23:59

Astroturfed by big banking? No way it could be astroturfed by btc shills. It only works in one direction. Lol. There is no big bank astroturfing, take the foil off your dome.  Its normal people pointing out the obvious, your excuse for it is simply denial. This sub is definitely full of that.

In the btc world, we are all millionaires or billionaires.

This is a real a look into the mind of a bitcoiner. But in all honesty, your mom dressed me this morning, she loves pleasing people. This is great for adoption. To the moon!
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:35:21
Possibly. I think the winning declaration doesn't start until $10k USD. You may have a loop hole here. Start a website that you always gamble and win, just charge a crazy fee to play it.

Someone is gladly taking those dollars and giving you what, exactly?
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:18:51
Im just trying to reenforce reality. Its what we do in healthcare. Look, ive said before, i need a damn good reason to invest in something. My wife and i make decisions together. I cant drop a few grand on something without her approval, call that what you want. I call it a healthy relationship. I cant give her a reason to buy it, other than, crazy risk/decent reward. She will slap a bunch of reasons to keep money invested that has withstood the last 20 yeara of money making, and probably give me a list of better opportunities. Its all good man, im just me. For real. Im one dude, married, with a kid.

But commercial banks are the lenders. Wtf are you trying to say?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:43:50
I hope you killed it. For real. If there was one person i wanted to make money during this mess, its shorty. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:56:31
Clearly its not, or it would have been adopted and useful by now.  Are you are right, satoshi created btc to get paid, not because of credit cards.

If this sub changes nothing, why do you sweat it so hard? Why do you act like reddit police? Why not just retire for the umpteenth time and let btc do its thing, and this sub do its thing? Honestly all you post anymore is how messed up the sub is, how bad it is, and how its troll ridden.  If you dont like it, stop showing up.

@_date: 2018-11-20 02:40:00
Lol. HELOC.  Thats how you end up underwater. But i bet your home is worth waaaaay more than both mortgages. Maybe you did a 80/10/10. Or an 85/10/5.  Bragging about heloc payments? You gave banks straight cash, thats the exact opposite of what satoshi wanted.

Well, rolex' tend to appeciate if you take care of them. Got my sub back in 2001 for $3500. Wouldnt sell it for less than $6k now. But thats a classic design and arguably one of the most time tested and trusted brands. These new watches and brands that look gaudy and cost 50k and up are just silly. My daily watch is a seiko chrono, its my second one, cost me $200 and the first one last me about 10 years.

Get a real job. Work hard. Invest in multiple areas and that have varrying degrees of risk. And dont spend beyond your means. Thats the easy way out of the pleb bracket. The crypto market just seems painful and parasitic right now.

Im beginning to think there are actually only like 10 pro and 10 con bots posting and constantly making new actounts on this sub, and trying to get my $$$. Its beyond comical at this point.
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:02:34
Just because i dont see the world falling apart and btc coming to save the day, doesnt make me unpleasant. I want btc to succeed. I just wont put my money into it until i feel its useful. For me, it is simply too risky. I like IPO's and dividens. Im no longer at a point where i need risk. If I'm buying, my wife and i have to talk about it, thats just how are marriage works. Maybe if i was a younger and had no one counting on me i would play that game. If will be used as currency and i have to use it, cool. I just have no reason to do that now. Ive said before, i think it would make a great use case for international travel. I hate using exchanges and paying fees to exchange usd. But im finding my usd work pretty good anywhere we go. We usually get local money just for fun, its always a good learning experience for the kids. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:09:21
No middleman here. Please move along. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:43:25
Bakkt is just holding you down with all the false promises and bs launch dates. Scratch jan 24th off, if you havent already. That was announced yesterday. They are a minimum of 30 days post gov't reopening, and that was if they had a contigent approval, which they dont. So you are now at 2nd quarter 2019 at the earliest. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 12:54:45

No. It just says at a bar. And said bar was previously fiat only? Sounds fishy.

Where was i being hostile? Sarrcastic? Yeah. Hostile, no.  You are young and never served in the millitary. Hostile?!?!?! Lol. You have a lot to  learn.  If you think my sarrcastic posts are hostile, i hope you never work in healthcare, patients and families will have you in tears. Get hard little man.

Its always on the horizon, like a big juicy carrot. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:29:22
Yeah, thats a great way to scare someone. And not one of those is a reason to buy btc.  But if you want people to walk away from you quickly and look at you like a lunatic, do that. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:57:26
All good.  Theres always time to start saving. Im not a big spender, outside of normal monthly expenses, i maybe spend $40 per month on silly stuff. I just have no time anymore. Work, school, gym, sleep, repeat. Weekends spent at home recovering and getting ready for the week, or at my kids swim meets. Its a life. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:54:48
Such arrogance? Wow. You are so caught up, you think im a different person. From my end, you sound like a crazy person. Seriously man, seek help. You go back to retirement, getting away from reddit will do your mental health some good. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:57:12
You think every account is a dup of some random shill. Its comedic at this point. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 23:51:27
Another trend, you, me, and the pysicist commenting on a sub Reddit that has over 1 mill subs. Where are the other 999,997 people at? Lol

Dude, your "new developments" we're the all the same "new developements" of 2018 and that was a great year, amirite?
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:41:47
My point is neither. It was a question.

So 2018 was a good year for bitcoin?

I started mining @ $0.12. TWISM
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:58:52
Seems like a waste of time to login and out of accounts on reddit to troll a btc sub?
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:28:19
No you arent. There is no date for the latest delay. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:39:46
According to many people on this sub, yes. The dollar is worth less, daily. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:29:42
It looks today as it did for the last 1.5 years. A new atm somewhere is accepting usd and gives you a receipt, and another bar is accepting btc to immediately convert it to fiat. The more things change, the more they stay the same. I'm still waiting for the fiat killing application of any crypto at this point. I wont put in a cent until im sure i can use it before its value is gone. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:23:41
But they dont accept it, they double down on the losses and keep buying a dying "asset".  They are enotionally attached to their identity as "coiners", and will lose any amount to justify this identity. Its sad, really. But kind of hillarious at the same time. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 19:20:27
They arent using it. They are selling at a 10% mark up. Thats it. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:07:27
You arent wrong. Have an upboop!

Its not scary, because noone is thinking about getting payrolled in btc. Its speculative at best, buy no more than you can afford to lose. And you need a bank or fiat to do that. Neither will ever replace the other. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 00:14:38
Bwaaaaahahahaha...... Troll level infinity.

Wtf are you talking about. Here, ill put into words you understand. Bro derp deez dip nawmsayin yeah? Getting owned, spare me, like i give two fucks about comments on reddit. This place is a time killer, nothing more, nothing less.  Im just here to have a good time, and trust me, im always doing that. Happy thanksgiving!
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:49:11
And what? Pocketing the difference? They just lost a ton of $$$ last week if they have been "silently accumulating" all year. Its all good, im sure you will invest with them, right?
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:27:58
I don't know, it just seems like this is all getting the better of him/her. The post are desperate and emotional. And this is the internet, who takes this that serious?
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:48:44
Not really. We decide how much to put in our kids accounts on black Friday, and dont shop at all. Amazon or nothing. Surf temps dropping, fish biting, lines will be tight! Im here on the pool deck watching my daughter kill it at practice. I just had a killer back/shoulder workout. And am looking forward to a new PR in the annual turkey trot 5k. Lile it or not. Thats my reality.

Lol. There arent as many people into crypto as you are led to believe. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:30:59
People are losing hard earned money. They have every right to be salty.  There isnt as much cool stuff as far as im concerned. I would say nothing has really changed in 2018. Schnorr, maybe. More ATM's, that are all very one sided and only help the owner. Not one financial institution that claimed to be getting into the crypto world actually got into the crypto space. Bakkt is click bait vaporware that will probably not happen at any point. Robinhood was a bust. Localbtc is scammy at best. I still cant use it for any real world purpose without headache and fees. Still waiting on the killer app. Miners going belly up.  Its shame, really.  I'll save you the typing of asking why im here, because thats the go to around here. Im waiting for the breakout tech that people claim to be here for, and still dont see it. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:29:08
4%? Nope. Less than 0.1%

You typed 6300 wrong.

And do what then? Try to pay bills with it? People you owe will laugh at you. You dont put the nail in them, they leased you the hammer, they will lease you the wood and nails too. And even after you are gone, you will still owe them.

Who cares. Elf is on AMC. Happy holidays!!!
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:46:29
Same as the number of bots and duplicates. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:07:04
Lol. So you prefer a bank rolled centralized mining system that just holds their btc and doesnt sweat price swings. That sounds like the exact opposite of everything btc. F the little guy, strong rich hands only apply. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:14:28
1 million subs, 24 comments. Anything seem off?

Deutsche bank? That same bank that coiners love to hate when talking about trust and bank? DB is the one they always bring up as fraudulent, money laundering, overcharging assholes. But now im supposed to ingore all that because of this piece? Make up your minds 
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:57:46
Right, they move on to the next thing. No problemo.  No reason for the hate. You have to take the emotion out of investing, or you end up chasing and losing. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:01:53
You took time out of your day to read my comment history? Creeper.

80% in China though. Not exactly the clean energy capitol of the world. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:48:47
The problem is that there is no reason to p2p btc. Localbtc is trash. If you are remotely interested is buying btc locally, people see that as a reason to try and add 20% to the spot price, as buying local p2p is seen as a convenience. Thats the issue with being your own "bank", your neighbor is competition, and you are fighting rates against bigger and smaller "banks". There is no reason to p2p unless you are getting a better deal than exchanges, and sadly, in my area, you cannot. People are still trying to charge over 4k per btc on my localbtc. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:20:01
I think that was slanderous. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 16:38:59

@_date: 2018-12-02 12:55:23
Why would xfer from exchange to exchange? Seems like you put yourself at risk, all be it for a short time, buying eth and then trading for btc. Just buy btc on coinbase pro and put it in a wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:17:55
A reddit sub does not effect the btc price. Settle down. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 17:54:37
Says the guy with a 3 month old account. Youre the real btc og. Doing the world a favor, on a reddit sub. I'm sure people are clapping at their phones and monitors because of your actions.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:03:07
The clap?
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:46:26

@_date: 2018-12-01 14:17:48
Bots will handle it. No worries. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:21:22
Not really. Most of the accounts are duplicates, not in use, bots, of fakes. One look at the activity should tell you that. Bitcoinmarket has 15% of the subs, and a lot more activity. Celebrate all you want, theres a reason the mods are not. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:33:29
Long term buddy.

Isnt GS one of the instituitional investors that btc hodlers is counting on?
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:27:41
Things that go down, dont always come back up. Maybe it will, maybe it wont. Lots of people got burned in the last year, they wont be back. You need a ton of money to get this to the moon, I'm not certain it will be available this go around.

@_date: 2018-12-27 21:52:18
So you have a piece of paper? 
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:01:07
Naw im good. Unless I was an early adopter and up 1000% percent there is no reason to. I would just be throwing money away in fees to say im using crypto. my mortgage company, credit union, and creditors dont accept it. So there is little point for me. Its just a fun market to watch. Still waiting for the silver bullet to show up. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:52:04
Hard to say, i came close to buying at 6.5k, but still thought it was dead money and couldnt pull the trigger. Thank goodness. Looking at 4k, i feel the same.  
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:49:42
Uh oh. Crypto is insulting people. Must a down day for btc-usd
