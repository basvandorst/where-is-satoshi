Stop lying.  GDAX didn't exist then.  Also on the date you have it listed as  Jan 26, 201 (what happened to the last digit).  Bad photoshop.

Well if you didn't care what people here think, then why post this at all?  I still call bullshit.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:15:16
Bitcoin won't "take over" anytime soon.  It will be a mixed economy for many decades.  When and if it does......We're fucked.  Can't run the world on bitcoin the way it is.

The intrinsic value comes from being able to buy food, shelter and a future with it.  Both bitcoin and fiat.

I just googled Consensus 2019.

Great work on this.  Always awesome to see what people come up with in terms of where we are at in terms of adoption.  everyone says something else 
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:00:42
Entertainment. I agree.

Another old guy with no clue on what he's talking about.  Stick to your expertise gents, bitcoin is something you've never seen before.

Asia?  There's plenty of friendly jurisdictions there.  Too general of a statement.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:43:56
This is a fake.  compare this to the other close up post.  Look at the grain on the wall.  Look at the perspective and skew.  Sorry had to call it out.

We could go all conspiracy theory and think there is some sort of agenda here.

With time being infinite, there's no theoretical upper limit for the bitcoin price.  If it's still used.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:48:23
Kind of like other speculative assets?

Hasn't it been the subject a few times already?  This is becoming a regular in Hollywood and Netwood.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:07:13
To even consider you may be nuts is to accept there is a conspiracy. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:53:59
Everyone knew this already
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:01:33

JWW Great job.  This is the type of new critical work we need.

Add it to the "almost every show with any kind of tech theme" talking about crypto list.

There's over 20,000 if you take into consideration ATM terminals that got upgraded with crypto services.   IE.  Ukraine, Phillipines, etc

With something like bitcoin, expect ATHs over and over until peak adoption is reached.  Even then more highs are expected.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:02:31
note they didn't say cryptos.  they said a "close cash substitute"
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:53:49

What happens to anything if 1/3 of the US population all of a sudden decided to invest $100 in any sort of asset?  Moon baby.

You have to do it manually, but whatever.  Now there's finally some way to transfer. 
This should just be an option on the app.
@_date: 2018-05-07 21:47:08
He's right. For now.

Novogratz is the man.  While Buffett and Munger are still trying to figure out what a cryptocurrency is, this guy has been stacking and hodling.  Visionary.

There's the members of the various organizations: Blockchain Canada, Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, Blockchain Association of Canada.  Then the meetups which are of huge influence.  Startups wise I could think of 10 more companies or names to put on that list....
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:07:32
Francis, great work here but I have to say you missed out on a lot of actors in the bitcoin space that have a huge impact on the ecosystem in Canada.  You're speaking on their behalf with this medium post and its title (as well as the ones who signed) so it would be best to say SOME or A PART of the canadian bitcoin economic nodes unite against bitcoin. 
But overall good work.
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:34:32
I could imagine a lot not also wanting to put themselves on a side.  Wait out the storm then go with the majority?
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:33:53
theres a ton of startups and smaller players above and beyond that 16.

Al Gore was the internet man.  Get your history right :)
@_date: 2017-01-29 08:31:48
He's part of the team that created it.  His father actually started the ball rolling with Bitcoin years ago.  
Just watch the news over the next few days and weeks.  Like everything else in life, time will tell who's right.

Bitcoin never hit $500 in 2012.  The max price of the year was around $13.

The e-mail paywall seems interesting.  I also use their "Pay for Access" program where people send me questions or queries and answer them for some BTC..... I always get to those emails first.  Have earned a bit of bitcoin this way.

Blockchain has it setup to look like it's one unknown pool or group responsible for that amount. But I agree, centralization is what we need to worry about. Trix are for kids. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:36:21
so even if i sent a small amount to that address,  i wouldn't be able to check that it arrived? 
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:50:02
hi Rodolfo :)  i just wanted to check the c4 campaign wallet to see how much they raised : 3PL3933fEBrbmuwhGXYqNHGY272BiLvSrJ   
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:20:13
So does that include independent miners mostly then? 
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:03:27

Used to trade Magic cards on Magic the Gathering Online Exchange.  Went about my life starting tech startups.  Came back years later to sell some of my Power 9 for some cash and there was this site named Mt.Gox.  WTF?!  
Promptly learnt what bitcoin was, spent 3 weeks holed up at home digesting as much as I could.  Bought 2,000 BTC.  Rest is history.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:33:49
No, but people receiving email money transfers right now, with the next move being payment of bills, rent, etc.  ate in trouble right now.  
Only reason I found out was because I was trying to get a payment to my account so I can pay bills.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:36:04
So the effected are affecting?
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:08:26
It's definitely a slippery slope in regards to use.  But effected means it's current.  Affected would be past tense.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:23:54
The affected are also effecting.
