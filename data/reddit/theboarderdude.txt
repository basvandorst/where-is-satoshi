Yet many people still manage to delete files. ATM bitcoin simply takes too much research and understanding to use. Simplify it, and it has a decent chance to go mainstream.

Wasn't really getting at that...
They take the approach of chopping down a forest to get rid of one bad tree.
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:00:39
On what grounds is it true? That your pissed at them so think you can go around spouting lies?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:11:06
Anonymous- excellent ideas, absolutely abominable execution.
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:49:03
What unethical thing have they done?
Yes, I have money in the company. Now, if I were to cash out right now, I would be at about 190% profit vs initial investment. How's that for butt hurt?
Now, what's your reason for being-anti GAW?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:39:49
So you want to "expose the scam". That would cause ALOT of people to lose ALOT of money, putting a pretty damn sour taste in thousands(if not hundreds of thousands) of people's mouths. I don't think you want another gox scenario. Regardless of whether you think it's a scam or not, it's in everybody's best interest for GAW to keep operating.
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:06:59
What are you smoking? Literally, everywhere except HT you people are screaming "scam!!" at the top of your lungs 24/7. And that still isn't enough, so best of luck to ya.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:56:57
Yes, it still is. Currently at ~$120 mil, third highest market cap.
Edit: care to explain the downvote? You can't argue with fact.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:56:54
1 is complete bullshit. There are pictures of the DC, and the order confirmation from bitmain.
2- doesn't matter if they point their power to that pool or not, they're still paying out at the same rate as the pool.
3. Like you fudsters don't either? Look at your own damn name.
4. Go talk shit to anyone and let me know how happy they act towards you.
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:57:21
Downvote for bring gaw into this.
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:29:49
Yeah, for some reason their software can't find a number of coins for xpy.
About 12,400,000 xpy right now, yes? Current value on cryptsy is $9.66.  9.66X12,400,000= $119784000
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:40:14
Don't forget the 50,000 that went to the FBI. 
36,200,000/100,000= 362 usd/btc
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:02:02
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE post a follow up here for this!!
@_date: 2014-12-24 22:22:28
No, *your* argument is "we don't want more bad publicity for bitcoin". GAW fails, and that's exactly what you asshats get, more bad publicity.
@_date: 2014-11-25 22:00:52
yeah, no precedent.
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:50:30
How's that superiority complex working out?
@_date: 2014-12-25 20:39:13
Yeah, and it's irrelevant because of the high volume. 
There isn't "extremely limited volume" in customer hands. There are several million coins in customer hands.
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:57:29
How about cryptsy? You can't argue with a 6-figure daily trade volume. Saying the coin's value is based off one coin isn't naïve, it's plain ignorant.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:10:38
Thanks, this worked. I couldn't find anything before because my /appdata folder was hidden for some reason.
@_date: 2014-11-28 03:01:36
Holy fuck enough with the FUD, why do you think GAW is a ponzi?
@_date: 2015-05-24 14:56:02
Care to explain?
@_date: 2014-12-25 19:45:59
If something *making investors money* never fails, how can it be a scam?
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:43:26
Except he still broke the law. Regardless of whether you or anybody else think this is "right" or "wrong", he broke the law, simple as that. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:30:00
You guys are scared that this will only add legitimacy to GAW, and you can't possibly allow that!*sarc*
Seriously, if he's such a heinous guy, then won't this expose him?
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:35:17
Pulling archives on GAW from btct... real good work there. Like pulling an opinion of Israel from some Palestinians. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:45:34
You don't understand a concept, so you use it against someone. Real smart.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:07:47
ELI5; What is the trial for? Isn't everyone agreeing that Ross ran the silk road? Is this just a formality?
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:46:44
So let me get this straight- you want to prevent GAW's supposed imminent failure, by making it fail. Great logic right there.
@_date: 2015-05-21 01:54:04
Last I checked a line of sugar won't kill you. Cocaine on the other hand...
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:18:35
Please enlighten me... Seems like some good stories behind this.
@_date: 2014-12-24 20:21:44
I'm sorry, you think this value is based off 1 coin? XPY has the 4th highest 24 hour trade volume. Those premined coins? The majority are now in individuals hands, not GAWs. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:44:47
Never hold more in btc than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:39:30
Building a pc is much different than building and running a currency exchange. Terrible comparison.
