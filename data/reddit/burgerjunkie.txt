Of course nobody wants their financial information public. Maybe I chose a wrong example. what i wanted to point out is what blackmarble said. proof of funds/idendity.

@_date: 2015-03-12 18:37:24

it is working again for me.
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:56:11
thanks. I heard about it at lets talk bitcoin, but havent looked at it. 
there was a website for files + a bitcoin paywall. do you happen to know the name? i could not find it. satoshi wall or something similar...
@_date: 2015-03-11 02:45:56
thanks, i know. only got a couple of satoshies there to test. in my opinion it is the slickest wallet there is and if all the tumbling works and everything else it i would give it 5 stars.

will any bitcoiners still be there on friday? anyone want to meet for a drink in hannover?
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:33:41
you've got mail.

show them fiver. a video or something you purchased before from the bizarre section.
then there is some sort of a download service. you can upload a pdf and for x amount of bitcoin you unlock downloading it. i fogot the name of it.... but the whole process is very smooth.
when transfering them bits have the blockain.info open in the background or projector so the audience can see the transaction appearing on the blockchain.

thanks, same here.
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:51:07
is there a idiot proof how to? have you any experience in it?
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:22:08
why dont people get it that the biggest chinese exchanges dont have trading fees?! you can trade 1k btc back and forth for 1 day or 1 month without any fees which pumps the volume on those exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:34:54
didnt know about that. will watch it at home tonight. thx!
@_date: 2015-03-12 10:53:59
lol 30 min before I started a thread: 
maybe we could team up.

ah, sorry english is not my first language... 
i want bitcoin to succeed. 
advertisers have more power than many people think. marketing departments from big companies don't come along with ideas. advertising agencies are more or less consultants. they come with (innovative) ideas and present them to their clients. the clients dont have the time and rely on the information from the ad. agencies.
in my opinion it is crucial for mainstream adoption to educate every party on the table. i dont want to publicly tell at what company i am speaking, but their clients reach from ikea to unilever. those marketing guys never heard of bitcoin nor are listening to what is happening outside their world. that is why they hire advertising agencies. and they always have an open ear for innovations.
