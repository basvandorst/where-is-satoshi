It has a lot to do with how much of a critical thinker you are. There are things I've been seeing with regards to Bitcoin that even if I weren't aware I could surmise from the delivery and intent in the dissemination of the content, that it's suss. We also live in a world where people's level of comprehension can be considerably low. In America do you realize how many functionally illiterate college graduates there are? Never mind people still believe in 'the news'. Like they just don't know better. Dial in a bit of cognitive dissonance. Make people choose a side, that's not really a side or a choice for that matter... �� Easily duped. Infinite facepalm.

What a time to be alive. All the discourse (sans feelings and ego) is brilliant. Even the juvenile back and forth we see does not over shadow this amazing happening we're experiencing presently. It's all very exciting. Definitely appreciate this thread of communication, those before it and many others that will follow. ��

You're in NYC? I know the guy that does it. Met him last year at a club. Gave me a sticker. It was a full moon night too.

They need to take advantage. Another company is gonna turn around and advertise their card as the 'best' for Crypto Mining.

Remember Washington Mutual? I had a check of maybe 5k stopped. Ended up on the phone same responses. They couldn't tell me anything. I ended up in check services and end up leaving the banking system alone for a number of years. Had a friend who's direct deposit get pulled from his former job that folded. Doing construction. Consistent checks for years. His direct deposit check ends up bouncing. They hault his account. Now he's got a negative balance and a overdraft fee. And one by one all of his electronic bill payments are hit his account for withdrawl. 
Banks... To quote Michael Jackson, " All I gotta say is they don't really care about us".
