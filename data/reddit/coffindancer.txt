ugh, this boils my blood just thinking about it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:00:55
didn't even read the post, did you? excellent.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:52:51
this ain't the poloniex help forum.

I wouldn't have said 90% of the things I did in my last post if he hadn't already said he owned 2 BTC. don't need to sell anything to someone who already bought it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:45:40
it's directly correlated to the amount of threads that ask this question, so the price will most definitely go down to 0.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:24:07
wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:24:14
hey look, it's this ol' thread again.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:26:11
green for buys, red for sells. green indicates upward movement, red indicates downward movement.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:27:16
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:38:06
That first sentence is such an excellent mentality. Right on, friend.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:07:52
why would you make transfers without knowing what a transfer fee is?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:18:10
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:12:50
...the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:01:12
i'm poor as fuck, and i assure you, if i lost the small amount of money i have right now, i'd be screwed. don't make assumptions about the *value* of someone's assets, despite the amount. 100 dollars of chump change to one person could be a vast amount of wealth to another. people with few assets should hang on to what they have as best they can, and gradually invest in things with their excess, that way they can better assess how to move forward with profits or losses. 
'anything you can't lose' can be defined by the investor, so to whoever is going to put in money, that's where the probabilities come from. which should be obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:50:02
coinbase already released a statement about this.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:00:01
did you even bother to read OP's post where they specifically mentioned them?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:59:04
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:02:08
here, the statement from GDAX (the Coinbase trading platform) is a little more clear. here they state that each coin will be separate/labeled accordingly. 
'GDAX will continue referring to the current bitcoin blockchain as Bitcoin with ticker BTC and the forked blockchain as Bitcoin2x with ticker B2X.
GDAX will disable deposits and withdrawals for Bitcoin (BTC) approximately 24 hours before the fork and re-enable 24-48 hours after the fork for both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin2x (B2X).
GDAX will enable trading of both BTC and B2X within 4 hours of the fork.
Any customer storing Bitcoin (BTC) on GDAX at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the Bitcoin2x (B2X) asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain.'
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:30:05
there are TONS of threads about this subject with loads of info. search function.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:43:09
yup, you can also view the order book and trade history to see what kinds of trades are being made and for what price. it helps predict the movement a bit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:34:01
as if there's something wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:32:54
his term has absolutely nothing to do with this, why would they be correlated at all? what about the years of BTC's growth before this past year?
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:40:09
you're fine.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:55:08
yup, look it up, you'll find it easily.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:33:56
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:53:16
the key is to look at the percentage of the increase, not the dollar amount.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:30:24
one cents' worth?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:37:51
it's not a bad idea to have one going if it's totally constant, that's a pretty low rate though!
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:39:31
that short pullback recovered ridiculously fast, and has absolutely nothing to do with the current price. if was closer to a flash sale, if anything.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:35:07
either deposit them to a wallet, or to GDAX, if you decide to try and trade. trading can be risky and incredibly difficult, however, so be careful!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:25:23
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:46:05
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:37:44
it was at this price like...a week ago. relax.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:25:21
check out the cryptocurrency sub as well. and make sure you research alts so you don't find yourself dead in the water with some shitty ICO that decided to pack up and disappear.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:31:23
10k in January was an arbitrary number, nothing is set in stone.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:32:14
that wouldn't be worth it at all. why would you get rid of your BTC for B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:57:30
nobody can tell you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:06:09
I was foolish and should have set a sell order around 6450 or so. trading is a whirlwind, sometimes.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:15:17
don't put in anything you can't lose. put in a small percentage and work your way up to larger amounts to minimize your risk.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:09:15
China never banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:02:48
Why weren't you able to make an account with Coinbase? Also, most people don't use brokers when purchasing BTC, so that may have taken a decent chunk from your investment, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:25:15
you just *know* some asshole is gonna ask 'what's this i hear about a fork'
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:21:35
if you don't think it's worth it, sell and leave it alone.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:34:35
what about it?
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:38:55
the problem is that strategy banks on B2X having more value than BTC. you're better off holding on to both, and seeing where the market takes either one, then making your decision after you have a more solid idea of what the future holds for either coin. i highly doubt BTC is going to be destroyed after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:33:05
there's some more resources in the sidebar as well.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:31:07
you can utilize GDAX to make trades and transfers with nominal or no fees.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:28:51
you're asking in the wrong place. check out the ethereum sub or the cryptocurrency sub.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:48:12
asking this on the Bitcoin sub hahaha come on. 99.999% of everyone here is behind BTC all the way.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:55:21
wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:48:34
a mixture of both, most likely.

i'm searching, but can't seem to find any damage. weird.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:27:55
wow, what a load of horseshit. just look at the way it's written, 'I am a Special Agent with Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, a United States law enforcement agency similar to the FBI.' 
this is almost comedic.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:18:27
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:19:05
then sell and don't make posts like this.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:53:41
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:03:15
this is mentioned almost every day.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:34:19
right? i'm confused.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:22
nobody really gives a shit if returns on BTC are higher than what the coins would've provided. there has been excellent growth on BTC without people caring about free coins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:53:34
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:32:22
i would be SO happy. i'm so fucking sick of 'what do at fork' posts and 'omfg why did the price move 20$'. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:39:40
not the right sub for this.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:52:26
fuck yeah, nice catch. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:27:02
'I am really doubting that it's going to be worth it in the long run', taken straight from your post. If you can't find a reason to convince yourself, this space probably isn't your best bet for an investment that won't cause you grief.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:36:52
I think you're mistaking me being realistic in my response as having an attitude. 
You really shouldn't be making investment decisions without thinking of these things beforehand, why wouldn't you take a certain price into consideration *before* buying in? You can calculate how much a coin would need to be worth for you to make the profits you want before purchasing. And honestly, you said you wanted to hear different perspectives, don't ask questions in an open forum if you can't handle reading some responses. that doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:23:38
it's not about getting rich quick, it's about being invested in the next generation of tech. which is just a smart move overall. hate this stupid negative connotation toward millennials making choices like these. so what if people make money while doing so, doesn't that mean they made a wise decision?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:05:11
why do people put hashtags on their posts here so often?
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:50:48
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:49:40
'just my prediction', as the dump already happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:36:47
you really need to go through the history of price movement with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:10:05
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:36:13
i agree. a good 90% of the topics here would be filtered out if people read the beginner's thread or used the search function.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:59:23
that's still an absurd gain haha good call.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:50:41
3k? that's an absolutely absurd target.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:36:38
it's done that kind of thing many times in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:22:50
yeah, I need to learn to get closer to the middle ground on limits, i've missed out on plenty trying to get too close to the edges without actually committing to it.

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:33:02

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:35:21
hahahaha what awful logic.

check again, QUICK!
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:26:39
someone just unloaded 62 coins, that looked nuts on the GDAX chart hahaha
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:49:35
you would simply purchase 7$ worth, and it would be converted into the amount of BTC that that's currently worth.
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:04:14
more people will start spending it when its value increases and widespread/convenient transactions are possible. it's probably a good idea to hang on to it and let it appreciate so you can enjoy it to the fullest when it makes sense to do so.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:08:05
Keep dreaming, I guess. This wouldn't do anything.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:23:00
this sounds like a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:07:35
are you excited for the solar eclipse, too?
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:46:18
it's not a Bitcoin ban, it's a (temporary) shutdown of exchanges. the 30th is when the specific exchanges close down.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:32:18
it's just too sketchy without any form of real collateral from the seller. i'd hate to see someone get scammed!
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:06:15
fucking relax, good lord. so many people are way too twitchy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:10:18
i wouldn't be surprised if 99% of the people who own BTC were aware of its price on a daily basis. what's the point of this post?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:52:10

or people can just buy and sell BTC at their own leisure despite potential loss or gain. why are you pushing this 'sell at 5900' rhetoric in so many topics? let people do what they're gonna do.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:58:50
some people day trade, but that might be too risky for most. it could result in great growth if you're disciplined enough. you could also search for job listings that pay in crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:49:27
just buy some when it suits you, you don't need to make a post like this about it.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:04:37
the dip caused by the Chinese market already happened, it seems. The price dipped down below 3000 briefly a couple weeks ago, and has been on the rise since. There was a small flash dip a couple nights ago (only around 200 USD$), and it's been rising since then without any substantial drops. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:27:46
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:39:01
this is so stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:54:06
don't have to buy anything back when I never sold, friend! which is working out pretty well for me today.
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:16:16
absolutely. it's a hot topic right now, and it would be a really cool/engaging way to raise interest in what cryptocurrency is, and how it functions. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:19:40
'only' make 300 is the wrong phrasing, IMO. how much would you be making in a bank account?
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:57:19
yup, all the way to zero. that's how it's worked every single time in the past, of course.
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:03:25
good idea, but there's just nowhere to discuss that kind of thing, zero forums whatsoever. :/
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:42:12
it's typically good form not to broadcast information like that. caution is key.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:28:38
You do realize posting this here won't benefit you whatsoever, right? this isn't the Coinbase support staff board.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:09:18
someone/companies with large holdings selling to take profits, usually. it typically follows quick rises, which makes sense, since those with larger holdings have much more to gain. when those with smaller holdings see the drops, that's also when people potentially panic sell and contribute to a larger price change.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:50:46
'crashed'. were you not around last month?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:27:50
this doesn't belong here.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:42:48
honestly, you need to do more research if something like a couple hundred dollar change influences your feelings this much about the crypto space. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:23:55
wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:51:03
your last three sentences are exactly what to focus on now, it's also great that your position in BTC was able to help you through a rough financial patch.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:44:49
"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy."
Rule 2.
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:05:37
essentially, privacy is your best friend with BTC, or any cryptocurrency! and keep a sharp eye out for scams or suspicious account activity.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:54:11
China never banned BTC. this is so stupid.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:56:51
I say you should probably get more sleep.

'10x his income' hahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:01:35
It's a trading platform, you can utilize the market with it, and make new transactions with much lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:49:57
it doesn't result in your coins being stolen, it's simply a possibility that some people choose to do their best to eliminate.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:13:23
time to find a new bank, apparently.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:02:39
Unless you use limits on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:41:02
I feel like 'resiliency' is a much better word choice.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:47:48
if it's something that you can absolutely afford to lose, then you're in the clear no matter what. use this time to get accustomed to the rapid changes that can happen, they happen frequently.
Just over a month ago, BTC hit under 3000 USD, and now it's over double that price. Expect corrections to happen when it rises. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:39:48
what's the point of this post, honestly? what is the objective here?
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:34:06
Frustratingly inaccurate topic title.
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:53:40
oof, I hate this as well. setting sell limits is so simple and easy, not sure why it doesn't convert for buy orders.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:35:36
most people would appreciate the surprise, I can imagine. if they have no idea what crypto is, and they se they received some, they might do some research and learn a thing or two and decide to enter the space. how much you decide to give and how really is up to you. kudos for being generous.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:04:16
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:27:18
did you sell low or something? how was it a loss?
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:16:51
it's a video...
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:22:49
China never banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:26:50
if it frustrates you, just buy it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:33:35
I wonder how many times this question is asked on a weekly basis.
