How can Bitcoin compete with other cryptocurrencies that do what Bitcoin does, but can use less energy?  
      
  
Additionally does it even matter if Bitcoin is using renewable energy? It is still siphoning energy and RESOURCES away from other utilities
  
Surely Bitcoin has a roadmap to improve scalability beyond other cryptos?

No, which ones did you have in mind? I was thinking if cryptos like like Peercoin, Raiblocks, and Stellar Lumens

I don't see how Bitcoin, a transaction medium that can do ~7 transactions per second, can be compared to financial institutions that can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.   
  
Surely Bitcoin has some scalability to address this issue?  
  
Isn't most mining done by NON-renewable, pollution intensive resources in China?  
  
  
Aren't there better crypto currency exchange if you are interested in decentralization that doesn't cause massive amounts of power use?

If Bitcoin was working correctly wouldn't a higher price mean more mining profitability, which would encourage more miners to set up, to encourage more transaction throughput?  
   
Is Bitcoin able to remedy this situation? I bought in Bitcoin at $30 so I'm probably low on the list of people who are driving the price up

At this point with every post not addressing the problem at heart, and instead deterring the issue to 'it just works' and 'the market will adjust itself', I'm now more inclined to

Because that post doesn't address the question of why can't Bitcoin use less resources in a cryptocurrency market where many other cryptos are doing what Bitcoin is doing but better right now.   
  
Why should I (and moreso anybody else) stay invested in Bitcoin if it has a dead future in the foreseeable future?  
  
That post just says "it's worth it just because decentralization and because it works good enough", but there are already many other solutions that tackle the same problem while using less resources.   
  
Why would anybody invest in company 'A' if another company 'B' does everything company 'A' does but at half the cost and twice the revenue?  
    
Bitcoin isn't in a monopolized market anymore, Bitcoin needs a roadmap if it wants to stay competitive. 7tps won't cut it

But isn't Bitcoin still using more resources than it should be using for it's purpose? Aren't there other cryptos that does exactly what Bitcoin does without massive energy and resource use(ex: computer component manufacturing and rare metals it uses)
