I'm kinda blown away that not one user cares to inform me here. 
Seriously, what the fuck?!?!?!
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:34:27
I literally don't care you're an asshole. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:50:34
Thanks guys I appreciate it. Was completely ignored with this question yesterday and it kinda upset me. This is 99% chance a scam. I would bet on that lol. We gotta watch eachothers backs bros/sisters!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:17:59
I'm very much sincere...:\
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:59:55
Thats just uncalled for. Thanks bro!

That's true, but you sound like a Chinese Social credit system shill. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:13:26
Make sure you don't hang around me because I smoke 3 marijuana after work every day, and only my TV sees me do this, but that is still recording to my .gov profile so I'm an "undesirable". 
Meanwhile.....lets fight about red vs blue while they secretly finish this system and deploy it overnight in 2020. Then we'll all just be orange! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:14:44
It is well known China is using social credit systems, which is a criminal act in my opinion. Whoever decided to implement it should be hanged.

Fractional Reserve banking is the cancer of humanity. They literally just poof money into existence, and it's only in existence because you sign a piece of paper promising to give your sweat and blood to repay it, then they go "OK, we have the PROMISE! So now we can poof money into existence because the promise of blood and sweat has given it value". 
I'd like to fucking loan people infinity money on nothing but the promise of their willingness to bleed and sweat to repay it, which then gives it value. Its fucking bullshit. 
Problem is people will always say "Oh, but they almost NEVER need to actually pay out the whole 100%, so it's totally fair that they do this". No the fuck it isnt because if we go to war or some crazy ass shit happens, then everyone is EXTRA fucked because we don't actually have anyones money since no one has bled or sweat their payments into bankers pockets yet...for that day. It's like living paycheck to paycheck, but AN ENTIRE COUNTRY doing it LOLOLOLOL. What a fanfuckingtastic idea!

Hopefully? Bitcoin has been and IS still the highest paid hacker bounty since the dawn of hacking, and has never been cracked....for almost a decade now. If this continues, then people will actually start to notice that, and the true value of bitcoin will be revealed. 
Then moon of course! LMAO
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:34:01
For some reason I am totally in agreement with this and have had this same thought a year ago when it was like 2k. 1BTC = 100 million dollars lmao holy fucking fuck. It makes the 21M Club make sense. Imagine a future where the 21M Club means your a minimum 100 millionaire. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:38:34
Being a doctor.....LOL! That takes years and years of education to learn, but being your own bank is easy as hell. [ has a great guide to how to be your own bank and you can finish this guide in a couple minutes. It forces you to read it as soon as you load the webpage. 
It's stressful at first because one wrong click or letter typed and poof it's all gone, but you just double and triple check everything and be vigilant. Don't let banks enslave you because you're too dumb or weak to learn something insanely easy to learn.

Bitcoin is the worst thing since sliced bread.
Cash is, like, so much better. Credit cards that are easily stolen and fucked over are definitely  best way to use currency.
Why wouldn't someone just travel potentially 10s of thousands of miles and risk being murdered to give the person cash?
Sending "bitcoin" over the internet?...that's witchcraft which was punishable by death in the 1700s, so obviously we should kill anyone who uses bitcoin with fire as we were taught back in 1793.
I personally would much prefer to continue giving some faggot the power to print money freely, but if I print money, then I'm a criminal. I'd like it to stay retarded.
Also, why the hell would we let EVERYONE take part in maintaining the financial system to ensure distribution of wealth? It's SOOO much better to let like 8 dudes put their metaphorical big black cocks up our bank accounts assholes, make almost 10,000 of us kill ourselves, and then give them "capped" bonuses of 20 million dollars for doing such a fucking great job.
God bless America for fuck sake.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:34:06
It's going to be 10k in no time. I sold a little at the last ATH and planned to buy it back when it went to 5k ish. It did all of that and guess what I didn't do? &gt;.&lt;
Oh well....lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:25:21
It would be like saying "I have 100 Apple stocks" and them saying "Well lets get some drinks then! Go sell your investment so we can get free shit!" 
Uhh.....is that how investing works? 
NAH NI**A HODL!!!

I sold my zx6r for 1.5 lulululululul it ain't no 13 thousand dollar bike I promise you that XDDD
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:27:03
I agree this guy works with a bunch of assholes. I've vaguely mentioned bitcoin and that I have made $, but I don't say how much. People assume it's a lot and say "eyyy lemme get 1 btc", and I'm like you fuck why the hell would I give you 7500 dollars???
It's "mostly joking" though as you can imagine it being said. They aren't like "give me some or you're an asshole". I'd kick them in the shin if they said that lol.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:50:59
It doesn't even matter who believes. It WORKS and that's why it won't fail. China controlling so much of the mining (Bitmain) may cause serious issues and a takeover could happen (possibly ETH). Regardless, a crypto WILL be the main currency within the next 10 years. Which one is hard to tell. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:06:30
You guys didn't hear? The guy who wrote "the book" on stock market bubbles is saying that bitcoin is a bubble. Not only that, but some OTHER old fuck that is the  investor in gold is saying bitcoin is "garbage". People with something to lose if bitcoin goes mainstream are talking shit about it....what a surprise!

It's insane how much money there is to be made seemingly out of thin air. I love it XD
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:24:27
Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
This allows for a maximum theoretical value of 100,000,000 USD. 
HODL! XD
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:30:19
I only have 1 bitcoin and this saddens me greatly. I had a balance of 200 BTC in 2012, but I unfortunately spent it all on silk road. I would have lost it all on MTGOX anyway, so I guess it's better to not know I lost 1 million dollars. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:11:23
I bet that's the QR to deposit into OP's wallet XDDD
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:29:05
In the year 2136 there will be only 1 bitcoin remaining and it will be the driving force behind the value of every other form of currency on earth, and being in possession of this last bitcoin would mean you are as powerful as an entire government....allegedly.
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:54:05
HA! I love this! Bitcoin will hopefully be a single world currency in the nearish future.

@_date: 2017-09-24 15:21:58
This problem is easily solved by ONLY transacting with your main wallet yourself using a dummy wallet that you load up before transacting with a stranger. Sure anyone can still see that wallet and that it was only one transaction away from the one they know for sure to be yours, but they can't say for sure it is your wallet at that point. You could even tumble your btc between your main wallet and dummy wallet. I personally would never allow transactions to take place between my main wallet and anyone else. It goes into the bs wallet that spends 99.9% of it's time with a 0 balance, THEN I send it onward.

1 bitcoin is just 100,000,000 satoshi
We still call it 0.00000001 bitcoin for now though.
What I'm getting at is that even someone with a bitcoin wallet containing 0.1 bitcoin will get 0.1 bitcoin gold. 
Actually getting your newly minted BTG is risky, but if you do it carefully you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:41:21
You divide Bitcoins because the value becomes too high to be practical, so you start working with fractions of a bitcoin. In the year 2150 ish we will probably have only 1 bitcoin left ever and it'll control the entire world economy. All 20,999,999 other Bitcoins will be lost as people die with their keys (unless we find a way to both secure them AND pass them on as inheritance). That is not an impossible scenario by any means. 
I see what you're saying, but youre not thinking. If you split a gold bar in half obviously the two halves are worth half of a full bar. HOWEVER, if that full bar value doubles, then what do you have now? A FULL BAR WORTH OF GOLD!
