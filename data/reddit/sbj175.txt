My understanding was that although you may participate in routing a transaction, you cannot really inspect the details of it. Maybe I'm wrong about that. But if correct, how could you be responsible for what you cannot even see. I would think it's no different than participating in a tcp/ip network.

Interesting. Can you explain further?

Not true. I have been in Bitcoin since 2014, for both philosophical and financial reasons and I know what a utxo is. They're not mutually exclusive.

Same problem here. Very annoying.

It IS just another altcoin. Period.

Every time I get paid, it increases the btc in the channel between me and my bank that is called my account. Every time I make a payment from the account it comes out of that channel.
Otherwise it seems to me my choices are 1) open a separate channel to anyone I want to pay, or 2) just pay them with an on-chain transaction which I think will not happen because it doesn't scale.

My question isn't about how channels work or their security tradeoffs. It's about the likely network topology that LN will evolve into. We're not going to settle every cup of coffee back to the blockchain. Not to mention, most people won't want the security risk of actually being their own bank. That's why I think the banks will evolve to carry bitcoin based accounts and funnel payments in and out of their customers accounts via payment channels. This all happens at the LN layer while simultaneously some methodology will evolve to settle major fund movements back to the blockchain.
If you think that evolution won't happen, I'd like to understand why. Maybe there's a more likely outcome - I don't know. That's what I'm trying to understand.

I understand what fractional reserve banking is. And I agree that what I'm describing does not allow for that. So maybe these entities would not be banks in the usual sense (using those funds for lending, etc).
But it makes sense to me that the default state of my bitcoin would be locked in a channel with some entity (all payable back to me) ready to use off chain. Because I can't use any of it within the LN layer until it IS in a channel. And I think for scalability reasons, the topology will evolve to the point where individuals will not perform on-chain transactions, but will only perform off-chain (LN) transactions.
So, in this scenario, the way I gain ownership of bitcoin is through one of these entities. Similar to how everyone accesses the internet through an ISP.

Also, it's not that individuals CANNOT perform on-chain transactions. Just that it would only happen if I "cashed out" my channel (account). Then I would be holding that cash and could spend it however I like of course. But non-cash (paying bills, mortgage, incoming pay, etc) would be off-chain (LN), same as I almost never touch cash today.
I know this runs counter to the ideology of bitcoin (where you are your own bank) and that's part of why I said in my initial post that I'm not encouraged by the thought.

Shorting Bitcoin is historically risky
