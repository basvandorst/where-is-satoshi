Same thing here, got the same exact email and when I asked them what the deal was. Signed up the same day with Coinbase and I've already been verified, purchased BTC and everything. Circle is a big W for WHACK.

Are they lowest fees? I've read their fees are higher?

Why though? I've seen a list of other providers, but no on is explaining fees. I can get BTC from 1,000 different places if I throw shit to wind as far as fees, I'm asking a good low-fee alternative that accept CC/Bank.

Yeah, but the "fee" always worked out to barely anything for me. It was like 1-2%.

I'm reading that using Airbitz with Glidera is a 1% fee... is this the best route currently as far as fees?

I see your point, and it's valid for a trading perspective. I'm not buying BTC to trade/invest/flip/blah I'm using it to make a transaction. The time I've held BTC in the past was for a mere 30 seconds while I filled in the details to send it out to the person I needed to pay. I understand fully that every institution will charge a small fee so that they can make money. But the above is far beyond that.

Are you pulling the "circle was more expensive" statement out of your ass? Circle is showing to have been much less expensive than Coinbase... it's not even close.  
Coinbase/GDAX are not 0 fees. Maybe you should look into that. GDAX has less fees than buying through Coinbase directly sure, but they still add a premium onto their already inflated BTC trade price.
