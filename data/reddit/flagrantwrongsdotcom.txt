It just doesnt make any sense. If anything they should especially look at a way to get like $10-50 amounts off of coinbase itself to any wallet without the absurd fees because thats trapped capital for no reason that technically in the US at least likely causes them significantly disproportionate civil liability at a minimum. From a risk management/business operations perspective it just doesnt make any sense to have that this way and given that theyre already paying these fees clearly they can handle that to some extent. Mind as well prioritize that in a way that would help them and their clients.

Depends on the government. The US has been screwing itself out of billions of dollars per week over a crazy ex gfs father former assistant vice undersecretary of defense john roger and a few others who failed to deliver compensation of a few mil for already billions of services rendered. If that isnt economically to slow down I dont know what is.
GB did something similar if not significantly worse which is directly connected to that.
Theres plenty more at the moment.
Without citizens that share awareness about stuff like that and demand people behave reasonably youre going to have a few problems if your assumption is an economically inclined competent government.

I was impressed that he could get registered that quickly with the captcha, picking a password and ID verification. I hear a lot of websites are taking more than a day for that plus the deposit limits/processing time still usually take a while to request a raise.

Finance 101. Theyre going to get their money one way or another. The thing is if brokers were actually smart they would make money with their clients (which can statistically be very profitable and you know not risk destroying your business) rather than viewing them as piles of money to try to take. You would almost actually have to be a business person or capitalist to do such a thing. I'm not sure where robinhood is these days on this but originally they were more positive than most.

Its funny you should say that because I know there are a few with billions of shareholder liability at the moment...

lmao man I'm happy for you. I hope I have that moment. Literally it would just take somebody actually writing a check for FMV for my skill sets or paying me back a small portion of what I might have created for a good number of wealthy people after so many years of abuse and literally torture.

How about the guys who were owed a lot of money and didnt get paid because of a sociopathic ex which caused them to be unable to invest in btc with any significance despite potentially correctly predicting price activity to date so far modestly from late 2010?

Are you a representative from kraken as your name implies or are you just a shitposter? Its reddit and you have a fairly new account so just asking.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:19
Ex gf. She wanted to get a ring but for so many reasons no. Mostly an apparent allergy to keeping her clothes on in the presence of men that her father even volunteered an opinion about on multiple occasions, sociopathy, multiple acts of treason, nearly killing me on not less than 5 different occasions, being turned by a foreign nation, murdering my dog then taunting me about it, a number of other killings she claimed and terrorism.
Beyond that try a former assistant vice undersecretary of defense systematically targeted advanced persistent operating environment even targeting air gapped, write blocked systems as well as physical penetration considerations. Unlawful behavior and systematic rights violations have at this point been formally confessed by representatives of multiple governments, people supposing themselves as law enforcement including a police chief and much more.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:19:54
Just ask certain people at the moment unchecked in the US or GB gov that have confessed to a criminal terrorist conspiracies against people contributing billions of dollars to their economies. Thats like the definition of a state threat against its own people if left unchecked, robbing their own citizens of economic benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:28:06
Its a reddit post, you could be posting nonsense. Classic shitposter move. Theres no account identifiable/verifiable information from commenter perspective. Eg we cant tell if you sent a dm via kraken etc that would obviously indicate you are actually a rep of kraken. I just ask because bitcoin has experienced a lot of sketchiness at times. It would be good if you guys had a social media account/rep verification page or something like that. Consider it this way, could you pretty easily tank a company's reputation otherwise given the risk environment? Your posts obviously dont indicate this at the moment. I'm just saying it wouldnt exactly be the first time an exchange was targeted.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:44:09


Her father identified me as a target due to apparent talent I demonstrated from the intelligence I've been given years prior to her introducing herself. She and her father are primary components of the creation of the drama as well as causing the introduction. Its standard trade craft. No offense but I think you fail to understand the scope of this considerably. Being homeless doesnt solve it. I moved to different countries and she still ended up causing problems or would show up unannounced at locations that I hadnt told her about in need of something. That doesnt even get into the people her father and affiliates send. This year was the first full year where she didnt randomly show up at my place but her father etc has been pretty aggressive with other things still. Its difficult to escape this type of thing in 2017 until the point of origination is mitigated. Its like saying somebody would ignore a walking pile of billions dollars that randomly throws off billions of dollars out of boredom and can potentially solve some problems. I'll definitely take some responsibility for getting out which is why I have considerable open bounties for lawful mitigations.

The biggest issue i have generically is my crazy ex with the former assistant vice undersecretary of defense father who has made it his pet project to make my life hell after defrauding me of several million of contracts owed for services rendered, getting me banned from the gb while he was trying to increase the likelihood of WWIII, after killing my dog, having me arrested on knowingly false charges, admitted international and domestic rights violations in multiple countries, systematic destruction/tampering/falsification of legally protected records formally admitted by a police chief, trying to kill me not less than 5 times, and numerous other things hes done all while costing the US economy billions at least, unnecessarily endangering US servicemembers/LE/etc. 
This also cost me actually being able to invest in numerous things like bitcoin which I even wrote reports about that are accurate so far since *very* early in its existence.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:22:18
What happened?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:39:54
Well mathematically we are talking about more than $12 billion just on that not including other projects by my hand. My back of my hand now has claws until thorns are removed from my paw. I'm not exactly known for being especially emotional with my monetary understanding. I had a hard target date then as well as trade management protocols. As far as moving forward its going to require mitigation of something from my past before thats logistically realistically feasible.

lol well i largely missed that part of it. I appreciate your post and your legend though. Its like a daily battle in some respects because its still literally never out of my life at the moment. This was the first year that she didnt randomly show up at my house or wherever (when I havent told her where I am) in nee d of $omething. Her father/she will still send people to threaten me, cyber/communications issues consistent with his stuff or what have you routinely. She comes from (before me) a small amount of money but they easily millionaires so more than a good number. She wasnt by any stretch of the imagination poor yet they do this economically inefficient nonsense.

Well I can speak for myself that I'm at least owed a modest amount of money and have an above market bounty for its collection.

* the statute of limitations for a lawsuit (class action or otherwise) regarding that is still valid in many locations
* Its now an amount of money that would be interesting for attorneys to pursue
* It would obviously be completely impossible to figure any of that out...
* Theres now motivation to pursue (criminally) for the hack given that its become a crime that would arguably endanger national/international security because its ~$8.5 billion dollars instead of a few mil
* Theres motivation to pursue it because it would further legitimize the BTC market and major exchanges are coming on board (CME/Nasdaq/etc) as well as the entire financial community that likely need or want the market to appear to be at least somewhat legitimate
* Further motivation because its a theft of ~$8.5 billion dollars of a currency which is supposedly used mostly by "criminals and money launderers" (as opposed to just cash obviously because its much cleaner... 90% of it literally has cocaine residue on the bills themselves)
* A bold move cotton... trying to hide $8.5 bil when even ~$500 transactions are automatically reported by almost all systems... lets see how this pans out
Pretty much the last people I would ever consider stealing from if I were a criminal would be technically knowledgeable people and cyber folks. I have a lot of respect for these communities especially. What is the primary userbase of crypto? Theres now probably several thousand people with likely above average skill with $1 mil or significantly more of a reason to come after you. I would definitely not want to be the people who did this hack at this point. There are easier lower risk ways to become a billionaire, like making an app that helps people send dick pics.
I dont actually know anything about this, I'm just saying I'm sure other people have had to have thoughts about this at this point and MT Gox has a lot of people who probably **really** want their bitcoins at this point.

Congrats. Something you might want to consider is relative value (eg if you can get cash for 2% and you can have reasonable expected yield of &gt;2% then it might be worth it to invest). Of course from a practical stance I understand the value of reduced stress/not having market exposure especially with something as volatile as BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:12:43
Well imagine when you called this rally years ago but your psycho ex gf and her father, a former assistant vice undersecretary of defense, systematically interfere with your matters to the extent there are formally admitted rights violations against the same person in multiple countries including by a police chief and the former assistant vice undersecretary of defense defrauds you of a several million dollar contract that was to cover operational expenses leaving you with limited investable cash at any point.
If you had *any* of the cash at this point you could literally be saving lives and stimulating the US economy by potentially billions of dollars on a weekly basis. Instead you just get lip service and nobody apparently can figure out how to write that check. A few mil or a billion in a week or less hmmm tough decision. Whats the cost of capital if you are basically literally printing it? Oh it isnt less than 1%? Whats the market rate for lesser services? hmmm &gt;=20%? Yeah I guess I'll have to get back to you. Meanwhile I saw some uniforms, tanks (and probably a few other things) that nobody even wants, not even the contractors, per their own words and are impractical from a whats needed perspective. Got to write a few checks for that.
Thank god we've got a top mind at the dod that thinks apparently a billion is less than a million. When you ask yourself how the hell does a terrorist organization like ISIS manage to attack the US on US soil when these guys are watching training videos, isis propaganda and buying isis flags via the internet while posting similar content under their real names on social media which we've been given just a little bit of a hint might be monitored you have your answer pretty much. Big blue asks who are people with likely real world IQs of less than 80 and or threats to everything?
Guy didnt miss the boat, has like &lt;$10 thats now &gt;$70 instead of modest money because somebody allows an arguably certifiably retarded, terrifying former defense official to muck about at the dod still.

What? I answered your question. I mean it should be pretty obvious that more than half of market that it appeals to is the appearance of less regulation. FDIC insurance is inherently requiring of more direct regulation and the US hasnt stated its about to accept a proprietary algorithmic system as its currency so why would it back a private market product?

Im not entirely sure the argument you are making given pricing mechanisms. It becomes a distribution of wealth/resources issue again like most markets. The original question is weird from a basic currency economics perspective. Its exchanged for in kind perceived value whether its USD, services, or what have you.
