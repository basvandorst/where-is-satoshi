No. r/btc = Bitcoin.
r/bitcoin = Bitcoin.
There is no sub for Bcash yet.

I'm not sure if you can read but it literally says what sub you are on.
r/btc: btc stand for Bitcoin, so it's a Bitcoin sub.
r/bitcoin: bitcoin = Bitcoin, so it's another Bitcoin sub.
Where do you see bcash in the sub's name? Nowhere, so r/btc and r/bitcoin are both Bitcoin (BTC) subs.

I shared this post with a few of my friends who know some non-profit organisations, smaller ones, that fight for animal rights etc. I also send these to a few charities I know and like, as I can not fill in the form for them. So I hope they get in touch with you!
Seeing all the reactions you got in less than 24 hours you must be over your head, checking every application form :P
How will you check though if the money you sent to these charities gets used for the "right purposes"? As most of us know, collecting millions of $ and sending that to some charities, often does not help at all.
We have annual charities in my country, that is supported by the government (they double the amount raised each time) but that money either gets used for rich fucks or gets lost... Last time it was 7 million EUR.
There was a documentary a while ago, about the earthquake in Haïti in 2010 where millions (probably billions) was sent to help people and help rebuild towns and houses. This was from 2010, nothing has changed. Instead, there is a small area where only rich people are allowed. Resorts, boats, luxury cars...
Haiti is already one of the poorest countries in the world...
After this documentary aired on TV, many so-called charities were asked what happened to the money. There was ofcourse, little to no reaction or consequences...
For my Dutch speaking friends, here is the docu:

He stated he doesn't give to individuals. And this is begging.
We all want money dude. He only gives to charity, what's wrong with that? Get a job.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:07:15
The guy literally said on his site he has enough money. He doesn't know what to do with all this so what better way to spend it on charities?

I realize this might go nowhere but you can always try, right?
Out of the 100 letters I will send, I could receive only 1 answer back but it's still better than nothing.
If there's one bar in that area that will accept cryptocurrency, I think people might go there and try it out, then see the benefits of it...
