dont worry, at the rate youre investing in cryptocurrencies, you wont ever have a house/mortgage to worry about

wait. so youre telling me when a dozen people hold more than half the shares/value of a commidity, they can choose to sell immediately? causing a huge panic/crash?
if only anyone ever said that. oh wait. pretty much everyone critical of buttcoin said just that.

why is personal responsibility so foreign to yall???
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:14:36
no we love it because yall have been gloating for months about essentially gambling tens of thousands on mysterious unregulated internet coins. 
we love it, because everything we said would happen, is currently happening. but im sure if you hold some more itll go right back up. might as well be investing in beanie babies tbh

@_date: 2015-07-10 18:32:44
good luck :)

not a bad idea. seems extraordinarily niche, given there are lots of people who can barely find jobs that pay in USD.

@_date: 2018-02-16 17:57:30
you dont know? you certainly acted like a smug jackass for someone who is so
uninformed on the subject. 
so what youre saying is they ARENT insured. 
now you are the one that sounds like a twat. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:06:15
is this true? ive been trying to find out, and havent come across a source
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:21:15
hey bro. maybe dont call people twats if you dont like them clapping back/proving you wrong. just a thought. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:50:53
