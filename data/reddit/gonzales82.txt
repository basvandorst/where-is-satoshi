Can any Chinese speaker translate the relevant part about blockchain? Google translate has failed me here.
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:39:21
probably it means Dentacoin

Ah right - thanks! :) Price inflation has to do with some standardized baskets of goods etc, right?
@_date: 2019-03-15 16:26:53
That's true - unless there is some sort of crisis (war, economic, climate?).

If you want to take this research seriously check out this  quite a comprehensive writeup.

Haha, do you have a link to a source for this?

That’s a good one - thanks!

Nice explanation, thanks! 
I would add that having a single PoW is also the most energy efficient solution, so there is an ethical/ecological aspect to it.

Fun fact: the total value of EUR printed by the members of eurozone over the last year is pretty much equal to the total Bitcoin market cap: 63,401,953,610 EUR.
@_date: 2019-03-14 10:58:35
True, however I fail to see the utility of having multiple PoW chains in the long term - one is all we need. You can use it to bootstrap multiple second layers, all of them benefiting from the security of the underlying layer.

Yup. Quadrillion is plenty. Get these sats.
@_date: 2019-03-29 21:53:15
People tend to freak out because 21 million seems like a small number and they don’t appreciate the level of divisibility in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:51:12
No probs! Spread the word ;)
@_date: 2019-03-29 23:50:09
2.1quadrilion equals to 21million (number of all Bitcoin) * 100million (number of satoshis in each Bitcoin). It's just math.

I think there could be other reasons, i.e. increased production costs, leading to inflation?

What is the best site to follow statistics of the Lightning Network?
@_date: 2019-04-09 11:01:54
- CoinJoin
- Lightning Network
- Full validating node tools
- Tor integration
- Communication alternatives to internet 
- Security hardware
- User experience/interfaces
- Standardization/compatibility
- cryptography enhancements in protocol
(via Francis Pouliot)

So how would it work if I want to buy lightning BTC with cash euros let’s say?

Awesome news, unless you're a "privacy" coin.

Which arguments have you considered to reach this conclusion? If you didn't *reason* yourself into a position, it's not possible to *reason* you out of it.

First let’s get to a point where an average mobile device can run a full node. These have to be cheap and lightweight to run. This restriction is driving great innovation as well. Keep the block size frozen for 5 more years, then let’s talk again.

I guess from all possible answers, currency is probably the closest definition, but you're right - most people just assume a fiat-like asset under the term. A digital store of value doesn't quite have the ring to it. But I stand behind my original statement, I think as accessibility increases, Bitcoin will become an alternative for a significant number of people living in weak currency regimes. There are more than 100 fiat currencies, how many of them can be said to perform their role better than Bitcoin? Are they improving as quickly as Bitcoin?

I don't think he actually believes it, buy saying it is good for his gold business. He made the debate with Ammous unlistenable - arguing like a child.

Fair enough, but this article is about the peso. Bitcoin is beginning to eat the weak fiat coins like pralines.

Not saying there isn't potential, but personally I'm yet to convinced by anything but Bitcoin. Admittedly I don't follow the governance projects closely, can't even tell which one is most advanced, seems early days. As far as boycotts, I agree with you, social media need major changes. I also agree with you about most people and privacy - so much education needed. My post here was for new people who might be buying Bitcoin for the first time these days - not sure why you're getting worked up and throw f-bombs around :) Take it easy.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:42:50
I mean it would make total sense for someone to try. But there simply isn’t enough liquidity on the market for something close to today’s price.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:01:05
Thanks Luke, is this for sure though? Since we already have 1TB MicroSD cards today and mobile cpus are advancing fast?

There's only one blockchain technology we need, and that's hard money. I don't think I disagree with your description, but I'm thinking more about what will come in the future. With more people living their economic lives away from the surveillance state, there will be more demand for services that do respect the privacy of individuals and merely provide a useful mechanism, open for everyone to use. I don't see a reason why in the future companies like Coinbase or Facebook should keep extracting so much wealth and data from people. They have done nothing to earn our trust, and others will take their place.

Every additional block added on top of the existing blockchain constitutes an additional confirmation for all the predecessor blocks. So yes, even the “Genesis” block is getting confirmed, for ever and ever.

I’m sorry, what? Bitcoin is a currency, it has nothing to do with equities.
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:35:08
The alternative is a system where corporations and governments do not have the ability to track your economic activity to a much bigger extent. I'm not confused about the role of fiat on-ramps, but they are just that. Since we're again getting increased traffic from new Bitcoiners, it is important to note that Coinbase specifically hasn't been a proactively good actor in this space, happy to dump shitcoins on the less than informed person. That's why I see them as part of the old world, they benefit from confusion and their asymmetric information position.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:23:37
This. Get rid of shitcoins. Don't buy stuff on credit. Work and save every month.
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:31:34
Don't get me wrong - corporations *must* be transparent! Especially when dealing with people's finances. However, centralized exchanges like Coinbase stand firmly in the old fiat world. Coinbase isn't working towards promoting decentralized economy and financial sovereignty. They are merely providing an on ramp for the potential of it, and profiting off the friction of the two worlds. I was just reminding myself that we have a long way to go before using a service like that will be either a completely background and/or rare action.

a] a solution looking for a problem (99% of tokens)
b] an "upgraded" Bitcoin - but without understanding how important the social consensus around Bitcoin is. If you think your idea is so brilliant, you need to convince the community. Bitcoin is about working together, not splitting off and doing your own thing.
