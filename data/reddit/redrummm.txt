It's another game judging companies than crypto. You can judge valuation vs cashflows or earnings, metrics growth, comparables to other companies/sectors etc.
How do you judge crypto right now? "Oh that project which has virtually no adoption and a non functioning project (like cardano) is worth $19B dollars! If I invest now maybe someone else thinks it will be worth more!"
I've been in the "crypto game" a while, but it's much more speculative than stocks (which are also speculative). 
Stocks have more metrics to go on. Facebook has a marketcap of $550B which is high, probably too high. But you also know how many users use facebook, what the growth in the userbase is, how much ads facebook sells to generate income etc.
No one even knows how many people use any given crypto, it's just a guess.

Yeah, I guess it's a combination of their decades long flat stock market, low interest rates and work culture.
People in japan just want an option and bitcoin is their only option right now.

Yeah dude, that's legit. You should check out Mark Karpelès and see how it worked out for him building an insecure exchange.

If youre only investing $25 dollars just invest now. How will an eventual loss of $25 effect you? Not at all most likely

Some people love cars. Luxury cars might give them a quality of life someone without that interest won't understand.
I don't own a car, but I can totally understand why someone would want a really high end car with features you won't find in your average joe car. To each their own, even if the item depreciates in value.

Dude coding an exchange is not the same as coding websites. This guy has som sketchy credentials. 
Look how many crypto exchanges had gotten hacked through the years. Now compare this to stock exchanges.
Hes going to lose a lot of money for his clients and fuck it up for himself.
Building an exchange is not a sideproject holy shit

I don't get point 1. It's not like CME is the lender in a short, they are just the intermediary and they aquire commision through a margin account (as well as interest for the lender).
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:59:22
Yes, but im sure a lot of people cheat
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:03
Well, bigger block size requires more computational power and thus more electricity. This drives up the cost of mining since you need to invest a decent amount of capital into the mining rigs and it also requires cheap electricity, which means that most western countries can't profit off of mining since costs will outweigh the income.
BTC is not really decentralized now a days since not anyone can start mining. You need to have money from that start and be in a good geographical position to take advantage of cheap electricity. BCH is even less decentralized.

A stop loss only works if you have a buyer on the other side. Its not the exchange that buys your btc, its another person. So if you have no takers at 8k you will have to sell at the best available price (which could be whatever below 8k).
The reason WHY a crash happens is because there are no takers on the sell order which pushes the prices down (and down and down). So yeah it might save you, it might not. It's not a safety net for crashes, it's to limit downside on trading.

I own, and have for quite some time, but I am critical to it. Right now btc has a lot of problems. I would 100% be happier if this crazy increase in price would have been spread over 5-10 years so developers would have time to adress problems like scale. Instead people are jerking off to memes instead of actually looking at problems like fees, mining costs, tether etc.
we have people on this forum who are gambling w their life savings, college fund etc at ath because theyre so deep in the memehole that they think they will be millionaires by 2020 to even at all look at the negatives of btc. Its all sunshine and roses on this forum! 
Except the $50 fee i had to pay to cash out a bit of my btc.

There's always been market manipulation in cryptos. Since there is no regulation, people will take advantage of it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:59:47
Sell. Cryptos obviously aren't for you, too high vol. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:10:36
So exactly what people on here complain that dollar rich people do? Hoarding etc
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:07:15
So, I noticed that it was you and another guy working on this, how are you guys going to be able to do this?
Interface is a selling point, but an exchange is much more than being pretty. How will you handle security? That should obviously be your  priority and is actually something that can give you a competitive advantage.
Do you have any previous experience programming financial systems or at least working some sort of compliance related job? All your previous projects were just websites, games or non related apps.
You give no information about the actual exchange other than pictures of the UI! You seriously sound like [this girl from an old reddit post right now.](
Unless you can prove me wrong and you have actual, relevant experience other than being a webdesigner/app developer and working on building a larger team you basically building MT GOX version 2, but probably worse.
For relevance: I have multiple years working in the financial industry, building interfirm systems and databases. Since this was in finance there was obviously a big focus on security. I would have no idea how to go ahead and actually build a secure exchange, especially with only one other person. So I hope atleast you have more experience than me.

Nah mate, take a girl out to dinner or something instead. Better return on investment. There are other opportunities around the corner when you're older if you look hard enough.

Second this, would be very interesting.

The problem with bitcoin is not bitcoin, it's the investors. 
I can't recall how many times i've seen people say that they're "all in or nothing", yeah so do my friends say who are fully invested in the stock market when they started investing in 2014! "Dude, im totally in it for the long run" and "dude im totally risk managing my portfolio". Dude, the only scary part that you've experienced is the occasional "dip" during the longest bull run ever. A dip is not the same as a drawn out crash over a multitude of years. 
It's so easy to say that "damn when it crashes im going to hoard so hard" but then it continues to go down, and down, and down. And people who where previously proponents and your "allies" start becoming bearish and selling off and you're own confidence starts wavering. I mean how many people say that they are gonna buy during a dip and then when it dips 30% during a weekend they get weak hands and dont? Imagine that feeling x1000 with the added effect of others not memeing "buy the dip, to the moon" but actually being negative toward bitcoin.
"But bitcoin has already had a severe bear market". When? During early 2015-end of 2016 when it appreciated like 400%? Bitcoin has literally appreciated 14m% since inception, there has never been a bear market.
Yeah bitcoin is headed toward mass adoption, but with that will come the greatest fucking draw down that every other asset has and will be ever be affected by: human psychology and herd behavior. 
You think bitcoin is exempt to this? 
Except for bitcoin it will probably be worse because not only is there an abundance of non educated investors who have never ever ever previously been interested by economics, finance or markets but literally NO ONE knows what is going on, not even experienced investors. 
I'm not saying that there is a bubble or a crash/bear market is about to happen, but sooner or later, as for all assets, it will come. And trust me, you won't be so cocky when it happens.

Yes, blockchain has proven that it is highly limited at scaling. But tech evolves over time.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:36:10
Lol what is your "analysis" based on?
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:54:24
This is not inflation at all. It doesn't increase the money supply or reduce purchasing power. The point of inflation (atleast in keynesian theory) is that there is an opportunity cost of holding money since the value will decrease incentivising spending.
What your saying is basically the equivalent of splitting a hundred dollar bill into smaller fractions than what is currently possible (1 cent). It doesn't increase the overall money supply (100 dollars).
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:34:47
Why wouldn't you buy at lower prices? It would lower your average cost. Just dont put your lifesavings or your kids collegefunds in bitcoin, put what you ca be afford to lose. Have a healthy diversification in your portfolio.

coinbase has been funded by some of the big VC firms like andreesen horowitz. It was never a basement project w 2 people.

Still, the gini coefficient for btc is high af, just the winklevoss twins own 1% of all coins.

Why would you compare hedge funds to an index fund? 
Sure, there are hedge funds that are long only, but most hedge funds are incorporated into a portfolio to hedge against the market. A hedge fund should have uncorrelated returns with an index fund. 
Naturally, you'll return less than an index fund when you're not 100% long the market.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:45:38
I have absolutely no way of knowing that, but something which is purely bought on speculation that the price will go up forever is going to have euphoric times and desperate times. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:25:08
Over time maybe.
The problem was that most people are delusional with their new "paradigm" talk. Is blockchain a revolutionary technology? Absolutely, but it's not like any crypto/blockchain/network is actually being used for it's purpose, it's being used as a speculation vehicle.
Once things die down and people start using cryptos for it's proper intended use, yes maybe it will go back to 20k.
Imo opinion the "limited supply" is a flawed argument, which shouldn't mean that Bitcoins price will endlessly go up. To me, a fair price of Bitcoin is the cost of mining + a risk premium (30-50%). If this is the case, It will be some time before Bitcoin goes up to 19k, if ever.

Isn't this exactly what OP said?

What would happen if the future, for whatever reason, *isn't* bitcoin? Kind of like how Myspace was the big thing before facebook came around?
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:23:25
I'm not comparing it with a website, I'm comparing it with a product that was once dominant which was overtaken by a competitor.
Yes, it can be compared to gold, although in it's current state it doesnt behave like gold. I'm not saying Bitcoin will be obsolete, I'm just curious about the risk of going 100% into one asset.
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:55:29
Why nothing in bitcoin?

How would you even apply the intelligent investor on cryptocurrencies? Calculating the fundamental value on equities is a whole other ballgame.
