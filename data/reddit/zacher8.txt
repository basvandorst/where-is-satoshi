You tried it, didn’t you?

So true.

Already happening.

That’s a nice speech, but why do you think currency was invented in the first place? What makes you think all digital currencies will merge? I think increased demand will trigger more crypto varieties, not fewer. Why do you think it will become infinitely valuable, and value-less at the same time?

Thanks for sharing. Good luck on your journey.

Just a credible rumor that x gov agency has cracked the cypher and can seize currency at will.

How did you become aware of this? Did you read about it somewhere? Some explain it to you? Did you develop this knowledge over a period of time or was it sudden, like a flash or an awakening?

Currency facilitates trade. Even if production gets so cheap that all products are virtually free, that doesn’t eliminate the need to trade for services. Supply and demand will still exist based on skills and abilities and willingness to perform services. I still don’t see why there will be only one currency. The technology makes it easier to create alternatives, and the demand will always be there if for no other reason than to diversify your risks.

Hate to burst your bubble, but this is just another currency. It will work just like the previous currencies except a government cannot inflate it. It is like the US Dollar when it was on the gold standard.

Your $ debts will still be $ debts. But if $ collapses, no one will want it. You will ask your employer to pay you in btc so it won’t lose value before you can spend it. Everyone will be happy to accept btc payment for debts instead of $ for the same reason. The exchange rate will favor btc more every day, so you will eventually be able to pay off your mortgage with a week’s pay in btc instead of 2 years salary in $.

Still, if his intention was/is to leave something to his family, he put it at risk. Maybe he figured he/they could afford to loose it, since it is inheritance vs primary source of income.

Can I have my coin back?

Just think, how many people ever find themselves in a position to be able to spend 15k on a T-shirt.
