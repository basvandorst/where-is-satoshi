The owner of the sub is part of the mod team. Either way, my point stands.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:21:57
Again though, the business owner doesn't handle the coins, Stripe does, and they almost immediately cash them in. The customer has the choice of purchasing this hat for $5 with their credit card, or for $5 worth of bitcoin at the current price dictated by Stripe.
If a return is inacted, I'm sure Stripe stipulates that the refund will be issued in USD of some form, not bitcoin.
Either way, that is all Stripe's burden, not the business owner's.

Why would you deny any payment type when using a service like stipe? If someone pays in bitcoin, YOU'RE still going to get cash. By not accepting bitcoin, all you're doing is reducing the pool of potential customers who may be buying your goods and/or services.
Edit: Just to be clear, I do agree that it should be opt-in. What it boils down to for me is that I don't understand why it would bother somone to have customers pay in bitcoin if the merchant didn't have to do anything different. As I'm learning now, the merchant DOES have to put in extra work and set up a bitpay account, which can be a pain. I certainly understand that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:06:33
It is still your decision. If you don't want any of your income being related to bitcoin (because saying that YOU'RE accepting bitcoin I don't think is accurate... again, stripe is accepting bitcoin and paying you in USD) then your option in this case is to no longer use stripe. (Edit for clarification: This was assuming that it was NOT an opt-in service, but rather if every merchant using the stripe service were being forced to accept bitcoin to continue using stripe. As I've now found out, bitcoin acceptance is totally optional for merchants using Stripe.)

I wouldn't call it a fallacy, since his research and theory aren't widely accepted, and no less than 50 independent studies have been run that found "no meaningful connection between choice and anxiety".
Furthermore, I would argue that it doesn't even apply in a situation such as this. The crux of Schwartz' theory is that there are SO many choices for any given decision, that it can lead to heightened levels of stress and fatique. Increasing choices for payment from one available option (credit card) to two options (Card or Bitcoin) will affect such a small percentage of people, that it is a neglible affect to be concerned about.
Some people will only have a credit card - they don't have a choice between the two, so they are not affected.
Some people will only have bitcoin - they don't have a choice between the two, so they are not affected.
Some people will have both - they DO have a choice, but only a small percentage (presumably) of this group will be affected by the stress of having to choose so much that they opt not to purchase at all.
I recognize your concern but dismiss it as unfounded.

Nah, I've unfortunately been in and out (mostly out) over the years. I had those coins on Mt. Gox but had forgotten all about them until that place was dead and gone. I bought in about 3 years ago for a bit of short-term fun but eventually sold out again for a tidy profit.

From an investor's standpoint though, it's still the same ratio. The cost per 1BTC doesn't change just because your initial investment is smaller. The value of 100mBTC changes at the same rate as 1BTC.

Mt. Gox is awful if you're trying to cash out. It seems they are unable to get your money back to you in a timely fashion.
I've been using Coinbase for the last few months, and once you get verified, it's very quick. However, they are not an exchange so much as a retailer. They're always going to sell you coins slightly high and buy them back slightly low.

I don't see why not, though I can no longer use Mt. Gox. They suspended my account a while back, and in trying to create a new account, under their new rules for verification, I haven't had much success.
Long story short, I've had nothing but good luck and experiences with Coinbase, and nothing but bad luck with Mt. Gox. That's just me though, and your mileage may vary. I'm hoping other users can give you a bit more insight into the state of Mt. Gox right now.

People paying for the convenience. Amazon doesn't accept BTC directly etc...
Also very possible they bought the bitcoins at $80/BTC a few weeks back (months back?). If that's the case, that .11 BTC they're paying only cost them $8.80, so the buyer is still profiting.

I bought my first full coin in July during a little slump, got in well under $100. I REALLY wanted to buy more at the time, but I couldn't afford it. I bought another coin around $130, and managed to buy some things as the price went up. I sold the last of my coins at a little over $400. I am happy with the outcome, but I wish I had been able to scrape together the cash to buy in more in July.

If he were addressing an audience that were familiar with market forces and terminology, then you would be correct.

Yeah, I did the same recently. I think it was something like 25k if I had just held all the coins I bought
@_date: 2013-06-03 22:35:46
At the moment, yes. I agree, it's not the best, and the currency is crazy volatile. In that way, it's more like investing in the stock market. The difference is that people accept this "stock" as a direct replacement for cash at the moment. No other currency gives you the option of investing and hoping for quick, short-term growth like Bitcoin. That's part of what makes it desirable.
And yeah, they're still over paying, but in a lot of cases, it's a hell of a lot easier to pay more with the bitcoins than it is to cash out, wait the few days, and then order from amazon. Maybe they can't afford to wait the extra week or so that it'll take to cash out from the exchange, but they have extra money in bitcoins, so they can afford the few extra dollars.
I'm not saying it's the best, but there's plenty of reasons to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:17:43
There is already a transaction fee that is included with the reward for finding a block. Generally, it is .001BTC per transaction (I think). As the value of bitcoin increases, the value of the fee does as well.

For someone who is only partially paying attention to the ins and outs of bitcoin, would you mind pointing out what the obvious technical weakness is to which you are referring?
Also, your English is better than most of my natively-English speaking friends' English is... and possibly mine...
edit: I don't think that a market going down is really an **excuse** per se, I would say that is a definite reason for a short-term drop. People DO panic sell when something like that happens, and usually after a day or two people take advantage of the lower price, knowing that it has the potential of going back up to where it was before.
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:19:58

I don't know what they do, I've only made one sale and it thankfully went through without issue.
How does your scenario set an example as seller protection though? That looks to me like the seller is still getting hosed, as the buyer still gets the goods AND get their money back.
They way their system works, when the auction ends, the buyer pays into the escrow account, and once it's been paid in full to the account, the seller ships the goods. The buyer receives the goods, and once they mark the transaction as completed (either by leaving positive feedback, or by indicating that they've received the goods) the escrow service then pays out to the seller. I'm assuming that's pretty standard procedure in these cases.

To describe the way you're explaining a backdoor attack, it would be more like this:
I download 'Bitcoin with backdoor.exe', because I don't want to compile 'Bitcoin.sourcecode' myself. I'm now exposed to the backdoor because I didn't compile the clean source code myself.
takes the extra time and effort to compile 'Bitcoin.sourcecode' to make 'Bitcoin.exe'. is not exposed to the backdoor.
Any time that you download software that you do not compile yourself, you are trusting the dev to not put anything harmful in the program.

Are you talking about the "Remember Me" check box when you first put in your username and password, or the "Don't ask for this for 30 days" when you put in your verification code?


If you're referring to the second, it doesn't (or isn't supposed to) keep you logged in, it just flags your IP as a "Safe" computer, and doesn't require you to enter a two-factor authentication again on THAT pc for 30 days. It has nothing to do with your username or password, and if you lose PC, changing your password should help.

Odds are only 50-50 if both outcomes are of equal likelyhood.

Now you're not even trying. Coinbase handles almost all aspects of what you're talking about. All you do is set the price in USD, coinbase tells the user how much to send, and immediately transfers the USD into the sellers account. Coinbase generates the store plugin code, they handle conversions. The seller assumes little risk, and not all that much work.

Ah ok. I would agree on that front. It is definitely trending downwards at the moment.
Part of the issue is that some people treat bitcoin like a fiat currency, while most treat it as an investment to trade in. Treating it like currency isn't really wise given the current volatility, and those who are stuck in the middle are really at risk for getting burned.

I have to admit, I recently uninstalled this app because of problems getting it to connect to any account I was using, and other general issues. Gave it a bad rating.
Seeing that it's not just a dumped app hoping to get installs, I'm going to give it another shot. I'd LOVE for this app to be what it is trying to be.
*EDIT:* After re-installing, it seems whatever issue I was having has been resolved. I've had no problem signing in with my Coinbase account, and will be trying my blockchain wallet when I get home. I'll fix my review on the store at that time.

Hey cool! Thanks for the feedback.
I know I would have bought my gold sub with Bitcoin had I been able to get a hold of any at the time. Now that I'm verified with Coinbase, it's really easy to hold a handful for things like this.
The more stores and companies start to adopt bitcoin, the more prolific it will become. I fully expect (barring some sort of regulatory disaster) that bitcoin will grow in utility in the future, and it won't be such a pain point for you guys in those fixed costs.
Those of us who are currently utilising Bitcoin as a currency thank you :)

Congratulations  in an attempt to be funny, you've made yourself look like an idiot. A webhosting company, of all services available, stands to make the most from the growth and adoption of Bitcoin. Not only that, but in publicizing something like this, you alienate an entire tech-oriented community.
Bravo,  bravo.

Price going down isn't a technical weakness, it's standard market risks.

wat. Must have been one hell of an acid trip...
@_date: 2013-06-08 13:32:03
Yeah, I see it now. I had to scroll down to see it an had already written it off by then. My bad!
@_date: 2013-05-18 20:06:43
You're joking, right?

Shit, it dropped from 143 to 130 in less than 20 minutes at one point.

How does calculus enter into it?
I buy 1 unit starting at $1/unit for 7 days, with an increase of $1/day, I've spent $28, and am holding $49 worth of units.
I buy 7 units on day 7, I'm holding $49 worth of units that I spent $49 on.
and are correct.

I'm sorry... what?

Your email confirmation for account creation still says something about Bank of Satoshi. Might want to look into that too.
Otherwise the site looks awesome!

I like it for a few reasons, the main being its volatility and potential as an investment. I know that's a bit shunned in this community, but I DO actually intend to spend the coins. I like that it is a very liquid investment and that I can make purchases with no huge penalty like others.
Most of all though, I like that it is controlled by and relies on individuals, and not some central entity.

You don't have to HOLD bitcoin to accept it. You can immediately cash out with Coinbase. You also don't have to stop accepting any other form of currency. All you're doing by accepting bitcoin is giving your customers another way to pay, and they would be making MORE money because they don't have to pay fees like they do for accepting credit cards.
Why are you here if all you're going to do is troll in an unintelligent manner? Do you enjoy the downvotes?

You know else who should hide her identity?

I'll take a look

This works the other way too. If someone were to say "For example, Bitcoin is showing obvious signs of being hacked at the moment, still you guys shout "HOLD IT!", the phrase would still have meaning.
You're starting to contradict yourself as well.


followed by:


a) software dev world or b) financial world or c) freeworld/anti-system/anarchism world
I'm not arguing that there was a lack of information on my end, or on the end of many here. What I'M arguing is that you're being a pompous ass and talking down to someone who was trying to stir an honest conversation.

So two strikes.
