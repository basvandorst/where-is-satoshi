BitFury finally killed bitcoin "anonymity". I expect a lot of arrests very soon, all past coin join transactions will be untangled very soon.

There are still many people with absolutely moronic amount of bitcoins, I am not so much excited about a couple of failed dump attempts. Still way to go to better distribution.

Russia can became a juicy piece of soil for cryptocurrencies. If it's legal in Britain or EU it can't be a surrogate and every gateway with KYC will be automatically legal in Russia (ain't they all require identity already?). Or even if you are buying BTC as a souvenir without a purpose of spending, you are also legal. Very cool and still very unlikely they will accept this draft.

People, **also take care of your backup devices like Home NAS**, a lot of such devices are misconfigued or their default settings are completely not secure. **Search engines indexing home devices easily and a lot of backup data exposed to everyone**. It's easy to steal your wallets by using ftpsearch, etc.
**Go and review your Home NAS settings.**

If you are an adept of transparent blockchain just ask yourself would you be ok if whole world will talk about money you are moving?

It's actually the same stupid thing as biometrical credentials, you can't change it.

How long it takes to notice fraudulent usage of GPUs at 100% load? 1 minute or 5? Following your logic everything is botnet-friendly.

Everything that can be computed can be computed by botnet owners. ETH algo is not efficient for CPU botnet owners and very risky to run it there using GPUs, because it's much more noticeable and owners can loose share. Period.

LOL, dude. ETH algo is the most botnet unfriendly algo I have ever seen.

Absolutely inefficient CPU mining comparing to GPU mining.

You should take a look at CryptoNote coins, especially at Monero. Monero is the only CN coin without fungibility issues that has the most literate community of users and developers.

Agree with Buffet. BTC is a vehicle, nothing new. But it's not anonymous. It's even worse than bank transfer.
