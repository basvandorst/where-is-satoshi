I bought ~ $270 worth of bitcoin the other day, do you reckon it would be a good time to add about ~$150 more? Don't really want to add more than that

I am going to take all information with a grain of salt, just want a bit of guidance. I am interested in how bitcoin will change and I am making sure not to put in more money than I am willing to lose

I'm going add ~$140 worth, after that I will hodl and not buy anymore, despite what may happen after tonight

I bought about $270 worth of Bitcoin yesterday but unfortunately I was unable to buy more during the dip due to a banking issue . But I'm gonna hold onto what I have and hope for the best
