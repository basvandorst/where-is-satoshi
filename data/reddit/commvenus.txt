I asked about this in  on freenode irc. gmaxwell told me that the raspberry pi is not very great when it comes to resource handling or something. He told me to try using something more like this if i wanted to try. At some point i will probably get one of these and give it a go.
I would pull up the logs but unfortunately that was two SD cards ago.. Kind of ironic haha.
I suppose i could track it down in the public log..

Id be all over a p2pool if a raspberry pi could handle running a node.

Not quite as bad as what happened to me March 19th and 28th this year.. yet.

You said it.

Ill make sure to message you and ask if its safe to buy. heh

Apparently its allowed though.

We are like twinnies. If only i had a time machine so i could hand myself some of these DAMNED block eruptors in 2009.
I guess thats what we get for actually spending bitcoin. haha

Aww snap! Matt Corallo burned coinbase hard. hahah

You remind me of the babe.

Interesting.. How have i not heard of this until now? Ive have always "known" that the supply was finite.
I think the bitcoin wiki even said it was capped at 21 million when i first got into bitcoin during 2012.
Also, thank you for the information petertodd. The statement luke-jr said was very misleading by not explaining the bug.

You could day trade altcoins. Turn that into 0.016 BTC. Not much but profit is profit.
