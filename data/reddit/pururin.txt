Well, seeing as bitcoins are ultimately worthless in the long run, I don't think it's such a big deal as you make it out to be.

Yeah, let's just close our eyes and only pay attention to the good stuff and ignore the rest.

What good would that be?

Hang on while I go create a currency of my own, I'll report the exchange rate in a few minutes.

Well, of course, if enough idiots buy into this scam, bitcoin will at last have some sort of backing. in form of foaming at the mouth idiots, but a backing nonetheless.

Nah bro, they're obviously a pain for him to deal with. $10 is fine.

Well, the reference they provide is a google cache of the EFF's donation page, which should have bitcoins as a donation option, but i don't see any mention of them.
@_date: 2011-06-02 21:52:38
The cached donation page makes no mention of BitCoins whatsoever, why?

It's going *awesome*, bro! The exchange rate for my scoin (short for scam coin) is at 7311.536 USD per one scoin! Isn't that awesome? Just need enough fools to buy it, and I'm all set.
Scoin! The currency of the future, the most dangerous thing to happen to the internet since WoW, the currency that will almost certainly be banned by the man keeping you down! Scoin, the rational thinking man's choice!

You're grossly overstating the importance of bitcoin. the "big banks", as you call them, don't give a shit about bitcoin, and won't. 
@_date: 2011-06-02 21:13:12
but why? what do you use them for?
@_date: 2011-06-07 05:42:11
Have you actually bought anything using that? Because it sounds shady as shit. 
Oh right, you're the creator of that site, makes sense.
