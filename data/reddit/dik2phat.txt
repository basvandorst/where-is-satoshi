Jesus, the comments in that article. People really hate bitcoin in a way I’ve never seen. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:29:42
Do u not understand what it is that makes bitcoin special? It’s the fact that it has no figure head and it’s so simple and easy to run that anyone in the word can run a cheap node and have a vote on how the network is run. It’s the fact that it’s so decentralized that makes it special. We have a system that no person or group of people can influence. It’s a true democratic system. U may not think bitcoin is better than Bcash, but u need to understand that that’s a matter of philosophy. We prefer decentralization and security over faster transactions so we think it’s better for those reasons alone. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:15:04
Awesome job. I sent this to all my friends. I’m a system’s engineer and I’ve been trying to explain this to them but I suck at it. Lol. Wish I was more articulate. Thanks for the article.

I’m sure this has been asked before but do u only pay taxes when you sell?

Oh, ha. I have no idea. Good question then.  Idk how they get their supply to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:00:22
Even if LN was centralized (which we don’t actually know will happen), bitcoin won’t be. That’s what’s important here
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:19:37
The fact that the network is worth almost $250 billion so mistakes are not an option. It HAS TO work right off the bat and all the testing takes time

people look at me like I'm crazy when they ask "so when will you sell your bitcoin? Do you have a price target" and I say "I don't ever plan to sell it. I plan to spend it".
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:35:54
I think it would have a major impact but if the market is worth over 600 billion, how much could $2 billion of inflation set it back. There is no question in my mind that it would be bad, but for bitcoin to go back to $300 that would pretty much mean the end. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:37:43
I would assume they just don’t want to go that route. You’d have to give up your personal information if you go through coinbase. I know a lot of people that refuse to link their bank accounts.

@_date: 2018-01-16 11:45:23
Andreas made a good point. He doesn’t think it will be centralized for the fact that in order to have large hubs the provider of said hubs would need to open channels with a lot of BTC in them and considering that open channels are hot, people would be taking risk keeping a lot of BTC in them. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:34:05
 I’m wondering if people actually waited for this? Anyone could have just sent their bcash to another exchange and traded it there or sold for dollars. Do u guys think this will have an affect?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:10:18
Transactions fees r everywhere. Pulling money out of banks, credit cards, taxes, etc, and then there is the hidden transaction fee: inflation (did I do that right? I wanted to make it sound cool)

A stable option won’t just appear out of nowhere like magic. We are building it every day and we’re doing it together. Holding is part of that. These stories prove the value of bitcoin to people around the world and as more people learn about it that stability and value will increase.

 My wife watches it you judgmental asshole. Some people are too busy with life. Working, cleaning, and taking care of family and children.  She sits down to watch it from time to time and it makes her laugh. There are millions of good, hard working people just like her that are not “mouth breathing dipshits” who barely get more than 2 hours a week to watch TV and when they do they just want to watch something light hearted that doesn’t deal with serious issues. You shouldn’t judge those people just because you have time to be selective and watch what you consider something worthy of your great intellect.

@_date: 2018-09-13 12:06:39
That’s not true. I work on Wall Street. The traders love it. There may be people at the top of the financial hierarchy that see it as a threat but all those that work under them are just regular Joes trying to make a buck. They’ll use whatever tools are available to them in order to do that and most of them are clueless about how the money system works or what money even is (which works both ways, they also have no clue what bitcoin is, they just see it as a toy they can play with to make money).

@_date: 2018-09-29 20:06:02
You’re right. They basically used the natural function of gold to bring us into the current system so there could be unforeseen consequences which is why, while being extremely optimistic, I always remain cautious. Hopefully we can do it right this time but who knows. I’m hopeful. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 21:15:05
it may not have to. We built an entire world economy around gold in the past and we scaled it. Only settlements were handled in gold and those settlements were much lower in quantity than what bitcoin can already handle today.  We obviously want to do better and that's why we're building things like lightning, but if worst came to worst, we could just port over the same systems that already work with fiat. Paypal, applepay, credit cards, etc. and work with that until something like lightning is ready. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 12:53:13
Or create a system that accounts for human nature. One with rules that are self enforced. I’d say the biggest problem we have on the planet is the financial system being designed in such a way that it allows the powerful to exploit and steal from the worlds population. Bitcoin is the blueprint to a new way forward. Even if it doesn’t succeed it already opened Pandora’s box. Also, I’m not saying it’s the panacea to the worlds problems but it could be a massive step forward for future generations. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:12:06

They are completely not disposable. Terrible way to put this. They have great incentives to keep things the Same. Just cause some assholes tried to take over the network doesn't mean we have to vilify the miners. They're just as important as the node runners and the users.

@_date: 2018-09-17 20:59:53
It's 100% related to bitcoin. The current system takes the wealth of the worlds population in multiple ways. It taxes it, it inflates its money supply (a hidden tax/theft), and it manipulates markets in ways that inventive taking high risk positions, leaving people to loose everything. The new, and ever growing world debt, has to be created to compensate for the business cycles that are the result of manipulated interest rates ( as  [Irish\_Domination]( in this very thread eloquently put it " it ties leverage to thin air as fed prints money from nothing and banks loan out money they don't have".   Bitcoin is money that allows the economy that participates in it to store their wealth without any of those things being possible (Gold works too, but it's too centralized due to it's physical properties (heavy/expensive to store/hard to move, easy to confiscate, etc). Hope that helps.

I know 3 people that got in early and none of them have large quantities cause they all sold (4 if I count a coworker that lost his coins on MTGOX) so I try not to be to hard on myself for waiting until late 2016. I always try to tell myself “you would have sold like all of them and not been able to hold thru the bear markets”. It’s the only thing that lets me sleep at night. Lol. I’m super jealous of those that got in early and held thru those crazy bear markets but I also hold them in high regard. Much respect for keeping faith thru those times.  You guys paved the way.

I work in the IT department at one of the largest investment banks in NYC so there is a natural cross section between personal and financial interests when it comes to crypto. You should see some of the debates I get into at work. I can honestly say I’ve converted multiple people here so I guess I do my part sometimes. I’m an idealist so not everyone comes along for the ride on that end but it was interesting to see what happened at the end of last year when the price exploded. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:03:29
One of the chapters in The Bitcoin Standard explained how India was at a major economic disadvantage from being one of the last countries to adopt a gold standard and it’s believed that it played a major role in it lagging behind economically. Looks like they didn’t learn anything from that.

I just want a hedge in case things ever go south, and if not, something of value that I can pass to my children (which i don't even have yet, haha). I will make my first purchase today but I won't go crazy. Maybe 3 ounces of gold at most. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:57:50
U forgot permanently greedy. Some people don’t see that bitcoin still has a long way to go. They feel they missed the boat so they hop on a low market cap coin and push the shit out of it regardless of how shitty or centralized it is so that they can make a buck. I honestly don’t blame them tho. There’s way to much to fucking understand to really appreciate the value of bitcoin. Takes a lot of research and reading.

I can only provide antidotal evidence so it’s not like I would know how people at the top feel, but I manage the IT side of things on a trade floor so I get to talk to traders on a daily basis and they all went from thinking it was stupid (they didn’t see it as a threat) to thinking it was an awesome new market to make money in. None of them even keep private keys. I’d say at one point last year about 50% of them jumped in and only 2 guys had hardware wallets. All of them just had coinbase or Gemini accounts. Some of them had well over a 150k worth of coins on exchanges and they never move them. I had to give them all lectures. Lol. I got in trouble with my boss because for a while everything was about crypto. No one was working.

I’m assuming, but don’t know, that he’s referring to freedom of self expression. Money allows you to express yourself. It’s a way to vote/support the things you believe in.

If it’s not what he’s saying then I have no fucking clue what he’s taking about.

I think people just don’t know. They’re not educated enough. For me to convert people (and I have converted many) it takes very long conversations and many examples.

It’s easy to be cynical because history has taught us that life is hard and the powerful few have always won but for the first time ever I’m optimistic that the people can win this time around.

That valuation wasn’t what he thinks it should be worth, it was the valuation according to that log function he was speaking about. It’s been posted on this forum many times. I believe he just meant that it should be $11k at this time so the price hasn’t caught up to the projection so he considers it a buy. That same function shows it being over $100k in a few years. Someone correct me if I misinterpreted.

Wow, I love how the people that were calling all this got labeled conspiracy theorist and told to take off their tin foil hats. Fucking amazing that people still don’t believe in the power of greed and what it will drive others to do.

@_date: 2018-08-13 20:45:50
It was a masterful plan if you think about it, just happened to fail (thank god).  They basically created their own money and put themselves in a position to completely dominate the supply, development, and mining operations of said money.  It felt at times as thought it was going to work too. I'll never forget the first bcash pump when it went from a few hundred to like $2500 overnight, while bringing the price of BTC down at the same time.    
I was actually thinking of something funny (and you guys can correct me if I'm wrong), but Mike Novigratz made a huge bitcoin purchase that night, stopping the bitcoin crash from getting worse. I wonder if he unknowingly/unintentionally stopped the flipping from actually happening. If so that will be a pretty hysterical part of bitcoin history.  Either way. These guys basically planned a hostile takeover of the people's money by creating campaigns to make it seem like bitcoin had all these problems (slow with high fees) while they were actually creating the problem (spamming the network) and providing the solution (bcash). Classic con artist shit.

I personally think that Bitcoin is by far (not even close in my mind) the best money available to us, but the way money works, as you know, is by confidence. If we had a crisis right at this moment, Bitcoin's superiority wouldn't be known to about 90% of the worlds population and I personally think that precious metals would explode in value.

Thanks for posting this.  I think not enough people care about the rest of the community, which is the whole reason I got into this in the first place. The only thing that I will say is that for traders, there is a different set of rules. The people that jumped over are probably not believers, and I don't mean in the religious sense that we get a bad rep for, I mean in the sense that you really believe that Bitcoin will create a better future for all of us. They were probably chasing profits, which is fine, but those people can and will inevitably get burned. I think the most important thing for us to do is stick together and spread the truth about what's happening and what the risks are.

he was actually being conservative. If bitcoin was to serve over 3 billion people in the future and handle daily transactions for normal activities such as grocery shopping, online shopping, etc and on top of that add micropayments then the estimates are that we would need petabyte blocks. Bitcoin would become a data center coin.

you got this all wrong, no one is celebrating that people are being killed, people are celebrating that now these people have an option they never had before. Do you really think that if the financial system around me crashes and burns that I'm gonna be happy about it? hell no. I have family and friends that will suffer. But do you think that if that crash and burn makes my bitcoin extremely valuable that I'll be happy about that? hell yes. Being happy about one thing doesn't mean that you condone the other.

But who said that it wont eventually scale? Do u really think we’ll be in the same place in 10 years? You’re assuming it’s stays the same. Also u can’t compare gold to bitcoin. It’s completely different in the way u store, move, and spend. U can still spend bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:44:00
if you watched the video he specifically spoke about this and he said he believes that off chain solutions will eventually remedy this but more importantly he explains why is so important to keep bitcoin decentralized and on small block sizes. If you disagree that's one thing, but solutions will eventually come. I think it's short sighted to think that what we have now is what we will have in 10 years.

The technology is not what’s important to me. The principals are. The technology that bitcoin uses allows it to fulfill its purpose but it’s not what makes it special. The decentralization aspect is what makes it a big deal. Bitcoin has the most secure network of all and it’s also got the biggest team of developers with a great roadmap in front of it. Also I believe that consensus is very important. We all collectively need to pick winners in order for this thing to work. Confidence is very important when it comes to people considering something a store of value. It’s takes a network effect. If new coins start taking over all the time because they have better tech then why would people trust the market when all they see is a new flavor of the month blowing up? But to be clear there r other projects I believe in and support as well. Gold and silver coexist just fine. LTC and VTC r high on my list. I’m 80% bitcoin and it’s worked well for me so far but I also hold alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:43:36
I think your looking at this the wrong way. It’s like saying that because Napster failed the record companies won and the world should give up on file sharing. The truth is that the cat is out of the bag and now we have hope for a significantly better financial future then we had before bitcoin. Even if bitcoin dies it will live on in spirit. There r other awesome projects out there. I personally love vertcoin. It’s the most decentralized coin out there and if bitcoin dies that’s where the majority of my support is moving to. Oh and there is also Monero.

they didn't buy the gold. They held it in exchange for bank notes. After large portions of gold were held they realized that it was unlikely that the majority of depositors would pull out their gold at the same time so they used that to essentially create "new gold" by creating notes for gold they didn't have (fractional reserve banking). With bitcoin there is not need to have them hold or store it for us, and even if they did, there is no need for notes, since the bitcoin itself is transferable.

Actually Saddam had his own currency called the dinar. We invaded Iraq because it was a threat to the petro dollar. The rules of supply and demand r supposed to apply to any economy but we’ve rigged it. After Nixon took us off the gold standard the value of the dollar plummeted causing terrible inflation. In order to secure the value of the dollar America made a deal with the oil rich nations i.e. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, etc to provide military protection in exchange for them selling their oil for only dollars. This in exchange put artificial demand on the dollar, since all nations need energy to survive in today’s economic conditions. Whether you’re Japan, Germany, France, etc it doesn’t matter, u need dollars in order to buy oil, in turn putting world wide demand on the dollar and propping up the value. Any nation that has threatened to back out of this agreement has been invaded. Saddam saw that he wasn’t getting fair trade and decided to sell his oil for the Iraqi currency, which threatened the security of the dollar and the world wide economy. Gaddafi from Libya did the same thing. He created a currency called the golden Dinar, sold his oil for that currency only, causing it to rise in value and we destroyed him as well because imagine what would happen if all nations started to do this and the demand on the dollar dropped a significant amount. This type of economic control goes back a very long time. After ww1 Germany was crippled cause they had to pay reparations. It pretty much destroyed the nation and it was all due to banking. Hitter saw this and created his own system based on work value instead of debt. He created certificates (money) that could only be issued after work had been completed. So if a construction worker had worked a full week then a cert was created for him. He put the whole country to work building infrastructure and doing other things and created what was thought of as an economic miracle, when all he did was circumvent the banking system and created a debt free economy. He was even time magazine’s man of the year. Obviously he was a mad man and one of the worst people in history but he did recognize what the banks were doing and after he got around it his people were willing to follow him to madness (he thought that the Jews were responsible for Germany’s destruction since they ran the banks and wanted to destroy them).  Just a few weeks ago Venezuela threatened to stop trading oil for dollars and a week later Trump was at the UN talking about how we need to bring democracy to Venezuela and its people. All wars are about money and bitcoin is one of the only peaceful solutions we’ve ever had so for all those that don’t understand what’s at stake here, I suggest u read “all wars are bankers wars”

I'm also going down with the ship. I didn't get into crypto for the money, I already have plenty of that (not trying to humble brag, many people here would be completely fine in a financial sense if bitcoin crashes) but for a better future for my children.  I don't want goverment having control of our money and everything else. The problem is that our history shows that we are willing to give up our freedoms for convenience and perception of safety. America has been a case study in this regard since 911 happened and I plan on not making the same mistakes twice. Bcash is trying to lure people in with lower fees and other bs while at the same time being a centralized coin with a CEO.  I hope people wake up and become smarter than that. Dealing with the fees now is a very small price to pay for financial freedom and security in the future. Plus, I have zero doubt that BTC will scale, whether it's now, 2 years from now, or 5 years. It will happen. The only thing that matters here is decentralization.

@_date: 2017-11-10 17:25:27
here is the problem, the directions of bth and btc are based off of philosophical/ideological differences. No one can win those arguments because they are base on beliefs.  the people following core believe that scaling off chain is the better option because it keeps the core values (pun no intended) of bitcoin  alive. you can scale off chain, keep everything decentralized, and provide choice. Bitcoin cash fixes the problem for now. But what happens if you have the population of the planet using bitcoin making multiple transactions per day and what happens if you want to include nano payments into the equation? you need petabyte blocks and who's going to maintain that? people don't have data centers at home. So again, its a choice between two different philosophies. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:45:48
I have mixed feelings about this. If it wasn’t for the market manipulation that we’ve seen in the past few days I’d say this was the wrong choice. People should be able to decide for themselves (even though they can still trade for bcash once they get the extra btc if they really wanted it) but considering what’s been happening this seems like balance. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:58:42
sounds like you're worried about this one specific scenario, which the road map eventually plans to reach these people, but even if bitcoin was free would these people be participating any time soon.  you still need technology to participate in the echo system. You can't transact without some kind of computer or phone. How would these $2 a day people get in in the first place? I think we should probably shoot for fixing the economic system we are on before worry about those people (which is what would really help them anyway).  Right now we have a system that secures the value of our savings.  We should focus on making sure it's as strong as possible. Again, the video spoke about compromises.  Do we want to give up a bunch of very important aspects of bitcoin in order to scale right now? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:15:00
so what's the alternative? do we want to derail every single thread with a fanboy war? that is why each coin has it's own sub. The "censorship" as you call it in just this sub reinforcing its rules. You're not actually censored as you have the right to go to any other sub and trash bitcoin all you want.

Same here. That’s why it’s super important to only invest disposable income. I’ve invested only what I can loose. Had to stop buying fancy clothes and cut out shit like Starbucks (is it ironic that bitcoin made me stop buying coffee?) so that I don’t panic if it all goes down.

The point of bitcoin is to have sound money. Historically countries have had a lot of issues with their own currencies eventually collapsing because they don’t follow the principles that let the money maintain its value. Also, being able to create money provides a lot of power to the creators and bitcoin gives that power back to the people. It provides freedoms that we currently don’t have and should allow for a truly free market. Those r just some of the advantages but there are certainly many more and  I doubt I’ll convince u in some random thread on reddit. You’ll have to take the pill on your own and go down the rabbit hole.

@_date: 2017-11-10 21:30:04
Here's what I find funny, people are so worried about transactions and scaling yet that has never ever been a problem for the world... secure money on the other hand, that's been a huge fucking problem. Entire countries are tied to their government's decisions and  people have lost everything. Transactions on the other hand have never been a problem. We don't need to compromise bitcoin for transactions, we need to make sure that it always stays decentralized and under the control of the people. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:42:37
The value is in what it can do over gold. It can’t be seized from you. You can store a large amount of wealth at no cost. You can move it across borders with you without even having to carry anything (just memorize your phrase) and it’s easily exchangeable and can be spit up into very small units. While it may not work right now for quick transactions, what’s to say that all these problems won’t be fixed in a few years. It’s not like crypto is gonna be a standard any time soon. We have a lot of time.  I think there is tremendous value in the security that all of these features provide. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:06:07
Oh Monero is great imo. I think it could be one of the most important coins available right now and I think it has a great future. I hold about 8 alts so I didn’t name them all. I think people need to be clear on one thing, tokens and currencies are not the same thing. I know ETH gets a lot of hate on this sub, but they’re trying to create a revolution in how we will eventually distribute the internet. I think we could have a future were we get paid to just provide services from our home. Provide processing, storage, and a bunch of other servicese to the world and get paid directly instead of having all our money go to CEOs of corporations. Basically it could be the backbone of the sharing economy or at least a precursor to it. I consider ETH and other tokens to be more like having equity in a protocol so I don’t see it as money. No reason to hate it. What about u? Anything u like?
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:35:44
Considering that most wars are about money it makes sense to me. Even the American revolution was taught as a rebellion against taxation without representation but the real reason for the revolution was that the Bank of England outlawed the debt free currency that the colonies were using and England decreed that we could only use their currency, which would of course be loaned to the colonies at an interest. The founding fathers saw this as slavery and we had a war about it. America was truly free until the federal reserve act of 1913, were under extreme secrecy the law was voted into existence on Christmas Eve while the majority of elected officials were at home with their families. U can’t make this shit up. Here’s another theory for u, JFK realized what was happening and created a state issued currency to try and free America from central banking. At the time of his death over a billion dollars of this money was in circulation and after his assassination the programs as never heard of again. Any time there’s ever been an attempt to leave the system people die. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:22:12
Here is the thing, there is no rush. Everyone on this sub agrees, bitcoin needs to scale. No one is saying that it's ok to pay high fees. What we are doing tho is prioritizing decentralization and security first.  For now, you can use your paypal, credit card, or cash. It's not like the world has problems when it comes to quick transactions, it has problems when it comes to secure money tho. You don't need to pay high fees if you are willing to wait a bit and if you want to start supporting the echo system then you can pay your friends in bitcoin when you owe each other money and set the lowest fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:40:43
yes, that's the other question. We are not even close to crypto being adopted and yet these people act as if this is an everyday issue. Even if it was, like I said, I'm more worried about keeping things decentralized and secure than I am about transacting. I have my fiat and credit cards for that.

Monero is true freedom. The question is, will another top crypto also adopt anonymity at some point and steal some of its thunder? I know that there r plans for privacy layers for LTC and BTC but I don’t know how that will pan out. I think there will be many winners. That’s just how the free market works. I would bet on Monero to be at the top of that list but I also think that propaganda works and I can promise you that you’ll see major campaigns against private coins. They’ll paint it as something for criminals and the masses will eat it up. That won’t stop it from blowing up but it would stop it from being number 1 imo  (I agree with u about it being the no 1 out of the privacy coins). I’m just dying for a nice easy wallet tho. Can’t come soon enough. I have a ledger and would love to be able to store it there. I like your outlook on Monero. I always remind myself that I have to get more. Smart move

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:59:25
No they don't need to hurry up. The problem we're trying to solve is not a transaction problem. We have no problems with transactions today in the current system of fiat. The problem we are trying to solve with crypto is securing our financial futures and removing the power from those that control the money supply. That's wayyyy more important than worrying about fees for something that isn't even going to be mainstream anytime soon. Also, you can't rush something like this. We fuck up once and its completely over. You can't fuck up when it comes to a confidence based market as important as money. Solutions have to come slow and be tested ad nauseam to make sure they work 100%.

you get paid for the portion of hash power you provide, so while you might be making less, you also invested less so it works out well enough for some people but if you don't want to mine then you can also run a full node.

one thing that you have to understand is that there is the core market that understands what is happening, they will always keep the support levels rising (that market keeps growing so the floor will keep rising), and then you have the new money coming in, the speculators, or the people that were told about it from a friend and sort of believe in it but they're not fully committed yet. These are the people that create the volatility.  This will continue for many many years.  I can promise you, that if BTC keeps rising, one day it will hit 100k, and when it drops back down to 60K, you're gonna see the real panic. lol. I'll still be the one holding when it hits 60k, cause after buying in at $4800, I don't loose unless BTC just disappears all together.

There is a lot of money involved and there are all types of people that want a piece of it. We’re literally talking about billions of dollars here. Do u know what people r willing to do for billions? It’s 100% expected that things like this would happen but you’re going to avoid something that could literally change the world as we know it and make finance better and more accessible for millions of people because the internet is mean you? Also, you represent the bitcoin community as much as I do buddy. There are plenty of people that don’t believe and r just in it for the money, or are only around for the positive moments but can’t handle the negative ones.

oh, haha, I used bitaddress.org.  you can save the html file and transfer it over to a pc that's never been on the internet.  As i said before, i used an Ubuntu Live USB.  It's basically an operating system that just loads from the stick into RAM and there is no persistent storage so nothing gets saved after you shut down and as long as you don't have an Ethernet cable plugged in that also means it's never been on the internet.

If the 2x attack does happen, then were does that leave the people that are not on board, like myself? How does the original bitcoin keep going? Sorry, but I'm still trying to understand it all.
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:15:14
Good point. The answer to your question is no, I didn't sell for fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:36:14
U can go ahead and keep thinking that.

Omg and here I'm flipping out cause I bought .2 when it was $4800
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:09:09
Well that's if everyone had a full bitcoin. I'm sure that as the price goes up people will start selling off pieces of their bitcoin more and more. I know my personal goal above all else is to pay off my house in full. If I can do that by selling I will, even if I risk loosing some gains in the future. When I have zero debts, then I'll truly feel free in this world. Until then I'm a slave.

I've been using a paper wallet that I made with an offline Ubuntu live usb stick.  Since I'm holding long term I don't need flexibility but I did finally break down and order a Ledger Nano for my LTC and ETH. Unfortunately it won't arrive until November :(

I bought bitcoin in 2017 for multiple reasons. Number 1, is that it can change the world. I trully believe that in my heart and I don't care how fucking corny it sounds.  I believe in the power of people and innovation to make a brighter future. I've though for years that there was another crash coming and it always made me nervous thinking that there was no way out of it. Now I can finally see a way (even though I understand that there are no guarantees with bitcoin). Second, for the first time in my life I feel like I'm in the right place at the right time. I see crypto as the new internet in terms of what it has the potential to be.  I think that people thinking they are too late are so hysterically wrong.  I think it's like 1994 with the dot coms, and this shit hasn't even gotten started yet.  For now I'm investing in all the "safe" coins so on top of BTC I also think LTC is a great option and I picked up some ETH as well.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:15:34
yes: 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:41:32
I bought in a $4500 and I bought an entire coin like the newb that I am. First time buying but I had always planned on holding for years so I don't feel like I've lost anything other than sleep. All the bitcoin holders that came before me, I salute u. Must be some shit to see your investment into something drop 30% in a day and still hold and some of u have been doing it for years. You're the true pioneers of this shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:46:02
My wife supports me putting a small amount of my money into bitcoin but she flipped out when she found it how much I actually bought. It was a huge problem so I promised her I would always let her know every time I put more money in. It limits how much I spend but I guess caution is always a good thing. It saved me from throwing a lot of money into alts. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:55:47
What do u use now? I ordered a Ledger Nano so I may just put it on that. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:18:38
I'm not sure what question you're asking so I'll answer either of the ones that I think it could be.  When I created the paper wallet two QRs are created with it. One for spending, and one for receiving. I was also able to encrypt the spending QR with a passphrase in case anyone ever got access to my wallet. 
If you're asking about generating private keys for withdrawal from the wallet, well that's a function built into a lot of the mobile wallets.  It's called "sweeping".  You basically just scan the spend QR and sweep the wallet to import all your funds.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:41:18
if bitcoin continues on this pattern the difference is that there will be more holders at the end of each correction.  I'm one of them.  I bought some at $4800 and I'm not selling at any point. I'm willing to go down with the ship (if it wasn't disposable income I wouldn't even consider that or advise anyone else to do so).  I'm not in BTC for the money, I'm in it because I believe that it could fundamentally change everything and I'm willing to support that vision until it either comes to fruition or it crashes and burns. I wonder how many other holders have that conviction. What you have to realize is that if we win this fight, not only will be rewarded financially, but we'll be part of the system that changed things for the better. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:11:32
fuck off. you don't use it as currency then that's great for you. I do. I've used it to pay for food at restaurants and I've used it to pay my friends when I owe them money, as well as received it. There are business accepting it for good and services all over the world. You think things will stay the same after this and I'm the blind one? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:07:14
I'd like to know this too. not sure what any of this shit means. lol.  I was planning on buying as soon as it hit $3300 and then buying more if it went below that. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:51:15
Bitcoin may be king, and I hold the majority of my crypto in it, but in a true free market you’ll always have several players. It’s not a winner take all situation imho. I choose not to overlook Monero and Litecoin. I think they will have their place. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 18:40:31
so you're telling me that one person has control of 60% of the hash rate? and the community is ok with this? wtf? I'm not saying that you're not right, but did you leave something out? That's just crazy.

I've bought 80% of my bitcoins from localbitcoins.com. I highly recommend it.

I listen to his podcast all the time. He’s much smarter than he lets on and I totally wouldn’t be surprised if he’s got a secret stash he doesn’t tell anyone about. I praise bitcoin to the high heavens and yet I haven’t told a single person (other than my wife) how much I hold and never will.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:05:51
Fuck that’s awesome. U need to post about it when u do.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:07:04
I fucking wish I had a friend that told me about it at $200. I’m somewhat of a libertarian. I would have eaten this shit up immediately. Sure I would have gotten nervous and sold but I would have bought back in out of FOMO and I’d have a much larger stash right now. All u dudes that told your friends back in the day, bless u u little saints. Once I finally understood bitcoin I never stopped preaching about it. It’s my religion 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:23:21
so what does this mean for Bitcoin Cash transactions? with such a low hashrate, doesn't it fuck the users? also, doesn't this open the network up for attack? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:56:09
in this assumption, do you see bitcoin being the only solution then? Realistically, i think that even if/when we move to a crypto currency society the markets will have a few different solutions. I don't see Monero going away for example and there may be one or two other winners. The total markets may be divided among all of these. Plus I would assume that the markets will want an inflationary currency (crypto makes inflationary a viable model because the inflation can be controlled by the code and will not be allow to be abused) to encourage people to spend their money. So we might get paid and spend inflationary money, and save deflationary money/assets (Bitcoin). Just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:00:41
You're assuming that they'll have to liquidate into fiat. What if at that point they can just start buying products in Bitcoin? you can't use stocks to exchange for other goods. If anything the opposite could happen and the demand for bitcoin would go if businesses around the world prefer bitcoin.

Not true, my best friends wife has family there and some of them provide services over the internet and accept bitcoin, Litecoin, ether, and Monero. I’m sure other people r doing the same. Also, she has sent bitcoin to her grandmother and sister so it’s also good for people to send over. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:32:15
You’re the moron that doesn’t understand the situation here. If people don’t use it then it won’t have value. I don’t loose anything at all since all I’m doing is replacing what I use. If your too retarded to realize how that works then I’m surprised you’ve even made it here to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:41:27
there will never be 21 million bitcoins in circulation.  at least 2 to 3 millions (some say more) will be lost to misplaced keys, people dying, sending to wrong addresses, dead wallets (wallets with amounts so small they can't be withdrawn due to fees), etc.  I wonder what effect that will have on the price. Also, the 21 millionth bitcoin won't be created for another 120 years, so there is also that. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:59:00
I really wonder if people understand what we r dealing with here. Bitcoin provides things that have never been available in the history of mankind. It provides the freedom to trade without permission of any kind. No government allows you to do this. This is true freedom. It provides mathematically sound money that can’t be cheated. Sure there will be scams and theft, but the system as a whole can’t be rigged in the way it is now and forks don’t matter. The market chooses just like it chooses everything else even if there are many other alternatives available. It provides a secure store of value that can’t just be seized or taken from the owner. You can hold it without anyone knowing or having to pay to protect it like with gold or money in a bank. People put high valuations on Apple because they sell electronics or google because they deal in information but I promise u that nothing is more valuable to people than secure money. Even if bitcoin is just a precursor to another coin, don’t underestimate its impact. Gold is great in a physical world, but it’s not easy to move or store and can be dangerous to hold.

I personally have no clue what is going to happen so this is more of a thought process then a conclusion but my logic tells me that due to the nature of human diversity in thinking, people will choose different things for different reasons. Those reasons could be ideological, political, or a number of others. I feel like we can't even get the bitcoin community to agree on what bitcoin itself is supposed to be.

Most people on forums like these that understand what bitcoin is are holding it. I’d say the majority of people r just trying to profit. That’s why we have so much volatility.  If everyone was holding the price would never drop. Eventually most people will hold if this pattern of it doubling every few months continues 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:31:10
Ah, understood. Thanks.

You're thinking about in person trades.  What about things like wiki leaks, the black markets, or trading restrictions/sanctions placed on countries? I'm talking about large quantities with a large number of participants.  Even ICOs are an example of what happens in an unregulated market that anyone in the world can just spend their money how they see fit. Also, look at China and it's currency controls


you're absolutely right, this is where the risk comes into play. If you're a holder then you're pretty much betting that this won't happen. you can't have the rewards without the risks.


again, if you're a holder you're betting on the future, that  Bitcoin will succeed and eventually mature. It can't grow forever. Once it reaches full maturity then the idea is that it will be a stable store of value.


Those were seized from silk road. You should know the rule by now "if you don't have the private keys then you don't own the bitcoin"


I've bought a lot of my bitcoin in meet ups off LBC. No one knows who's account those wallets belong to even if they can see the balances. 


if you consider the growth that it's seen as "struggling" then I don't really have an argument for you.
