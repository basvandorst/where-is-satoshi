If Coinbase wants to steal your coins, they don't need to go through the app at all. Do you understand? With the single developer, it takes the point of failure and control of the coins out of the Coinbase's hands and put it on the app and its SINGLE developer instead.

1 minutes is not that long when you are waiting for a cup of coffee or hotdog. If anything goes wrong when you are waiting at least the seller can keep the goods.

Ehh..... RT works for Russian government so they pretty much have to. And the article falsely stated that Bitcoin is banned in China in order to convince Russians that it's ok, because China banned it too lol. The funny thing is Chinese are buying almost as much Bitcoin as USD

A well run software company shouldn't have this issue by implementing several protocols to ensure that this won't happen. Because the same apply to any online banking systems. When you have a whole companies' employees careers and stock options on the line, people are gonna be extra careful with this kind of things, usually(Obvioulsy not Mt. Gox. Good thing their website's ancient designs scared me off it).

Yea they can get Goxed. But the chance of a single developer making a malicious app vs an experienced company is much much higher.

Good work!

Why? Coinbase doesn't own the guy and his Apple Developer account, unless they hire him there's no way Coinbase can have complete control over the app. The guy can show them the source code, then change it then archive it before submitting it to Apple. There's no way(almost) Coinbase can tell if the archive codes are the same as the source code the developer showed them.

Let's hope it doesn't come to that..... Coinbase need to stop this behavior right away!!

I've been saying Bitcoin is better served as a "Virtual Asset" than a currency for the past few months. Let the alt coins with low transaction times to take on the task of "Virtual Currency". 
Why would this actually be good for Bitcoin?
1. Blockchain size. Micro transactions like buying a hot dog would blow up the already huge blockchain size. Let alt coins take on those tasks, and Bitcoin for the bigger movements of value.
2. Stabilization. If Bitcoins served as the entrance to other alt currencies, Bitcoins price stability would benefit from being the buffer between fiat and alt.
3. Focus. By removing the need for Bitcoin to serve as the everyday currency, Bitcoin companies can focus on promoting Bitcoin as an investment for retirements instead of digital cash.
So which altcoin should take on the task of virtual currency? The second most popular altcoin on google and Reddit is Dogecoin. It has the confirmation of 1 minute, established community, merchants, exchanges. Everyone love the coin! It's time to stop hating and start seeing Dogecoin as the savior of Bitcoin's confirmation time dilemma!

Not to mention that people don't mention the "mining" cost. It's about 0.4% of total daily transaction right now. So that $18 million transfer in reality cost about $70,000.

Yea and I'm saying they should! Either petition to Apple to take down the app or acquire the app.

I'm sure everyone's thinking the same about Mark Karpelès from Mt. Gox, why is he still freely walking around and twitting sunset??

If the app has access to your Coinbase API, the app can do pretty much everything you can do with the app such as sending coins to anyone the app wants to send to. When that happens, Coinbase would be blame for it, not the app and its rogue developer. Imagine Mt. Gox all over again.

When you guys look down on Dogecoin, it just shows that you don't understand cryptocurrency at all. When you buy a Bitcoin, you are not buying a virtual currency, you are buying a Internet social network stock, because it behaves more like tech stock than anything. Right now when people think Dogecoin, people think fun and kindness. When people think Bitcoin, people think greed, drugs and hacking. If you want Bitcoin to succeed, you have to build a positive culture around it.
If you make Bitcoin all about $$$, people will stick with Visa and Debit for day to day transactions because its faster than the slow 10 mins of confirmations of bitcoin and they are backed by banks. Gold and Stocks for investments because they have intrinsic values. A country cannot thrive without a strong culture behind it just like Bitcoin.
If anything, Dogecoin is helping to attract general public to cryptocurrencies by raising curiosity through positivity. Bitcoin users need to embrace that. The way I see it, Bitcoin will eventually become a virtual asset, and Dogecoin the virtual currencies due to the differences in advantages and disadvantages. They CAN BOTH THRIVE!

Very poor judgement indeed. A smart hacker would create the app that's complete legit, wait for the user base to grow, then 1 day with "minor bug fixes update", BAM! Everyone's funds GONE!! Coinbase can either hire that guy and make the app their own, or strongly discourage any downloads for the app. Any other response would be extremely short-sighted and irresponsible of them.
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:03:01
No, but it's very likely that you'll still be in the store within a minute after the transaction. So at least they have a chance to revert the transaction. 10 minutes is a world of difference though. Asking someone to wait a minute is very different than 10 minutes.

But shit! It was 99 Doge!!

I made an iPhone app, yea binaries is uploaded to Apple with no way of retrieving it and verifying it unfortunately... Of course if there's a public service that compile and upload the codes on the developer's behalf then this would be possible.
