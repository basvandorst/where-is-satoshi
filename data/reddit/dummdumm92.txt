Use coinbases less retarded brother, GDAX. It pays the fees for you. Or I believe it did. Haven’t used it in a bit. Hope this helps! But for real, fees are crazy high right now.
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:36:52
Run a deep scan. I do it every night I shut down my pc.
Edit: and never click on any links on the pc or mobile device you use to access private keys or online exchanges. This is why I kept one old phone, and only use that pc for crypto. I’m a bit paranoid though, so you should be fine.

It may not have been a virus. But better safe than sorry my friend!
@_date: 2018-01-11 22:13:26
No. And it depends on the tx at the time of transactions. Some might go through in 20ish minutes. Others might take hours. Some longer if you set a low tx.

10 k in twice as many days? With these fees and 274,000 unconfirmed transactions? You’re out your mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:22:51
Hence we don’t use gold anymore. Funny how that happens. Something becomes cumbersome, unsightly and more of a hassle than its worth and people stop using it.

If you want the money ASAP, electrum to gdax, gdax to PayPal is about the fastest route. Bank accounts take 3-7 days, but you don’t get hit with the 2.5 % fee from PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:24:12
As a whole? Thought it was 51%
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:57:51
Hard forks are good for crypto currency. They are bad for the bad tech fork, which in this case would be bitcoin core. Don’t fear the fork, fear the coin with the devs that is slowly strangling itself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:39
Time? They’ve had nothing but time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:58:09
The whole reason bitcoin existed was P2P, low tx, fast currency for the people without stacks of cash. 
Makes you feel dirty inside.... huh?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:09:26
And some people are dead because of it. What’s your point? You got lucky so everyone else will? Don’t be that naive please.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:50
Okay I’ll bite, from whom is this propaganda spewing, and what does that have to do with bitcoin having the largest fees to date, and 200,000 unconfirmed transactions? 6 trans a second is not going to cut it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:11:22
If bitcoin doesn’t strangle itself in the next year, I’d be completely surprised. 60,000 additional unconfirmed transactions in one day. Now we’re up to 230,000 unconfirmed, taxes at ath.. something needs to change now for btc core. If something can be done to hobble it’s way for a year before LN, it might make it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:23:06
That’s just ignorance talking there. Or you misunderstood. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:01:11
Because that always works for the best.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:27:24
Where is this whole attack idea coming from this time? Does bitcoin not have corrections anymore? Are dips not a thing? Bitcoin has astronomical fees right now, and close to 200,000 unconfirmed transactions. This is not an attack on bitcoin by anyone other than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:08:15
I’m sorry my man, I misunderstood, the price you click sell on, is the price you’ll get be locked into even if it takes days to go through. If you sold right now at say 16k, and it dropped to 12k an hour later and stayed at 12k, you’ll get 16k price.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:39:41
This is what’s wrong with bitcoin. It wasn’t meant to be some store of value, like gold or silver. It’s meant to be a peer to peer currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:29:15
Couple hours? 3-5 business days. Unless you go coinbase - gdax - paypal
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:52
It’s not about being butthurt or wrong, people have killed themselves over crypto. You can’t say for certain what the market is going to do. Yes you might make an educated guess, but it’s still a guess.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:39:58

Better tech, better chance of survival.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:19:56
Ah, gdax is the more sophisticated version of coinbase. If you have a coinbase account, you can use that same login info for gdax, they are sister exchanges. You’ll have a 2.5% fee going through PayPal (almost instantly) or go through bank account and I think there is no fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:32:59
In your head, how does a store of value with no actual value stay afloat? Segwit adoption is back down to 10%, fees are still ridiculous. Difficulty has increased 38% for the month of December alone. Mempool at 170k unconfirmed..  but you’re right I’m sure. TO THE MOON 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:10
You got the info on that? I’d like to see it.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:09:46
What’s your current fees? If you wanted to move $20 of btc right now, you could pay 100% in fees and you know what? It still might not move in a week. Btc is a cripple in a wheelchair right now *cue lightning network should be here any time* yeah.. sure man. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:34
I’d like to read what the ceo did exactly, link?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:16

Oh? When’s the last time you bought a cup of coffee with .0024 ounces of gold? I think some wires got crossed and we’re discussing two different things.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:49:18
These fees are disgusting.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:24:04
Fees are going to get worse for btc for a couple weeks during this difficulty adjustment. Other coins have much lower fees.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:18:56
If you believe in the idea behind crypto, vast changes needs to hit bitcoin soon. Very very soon. 200,000 unconfirmed transactions, and the fees, god damn the fees have to go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:45
Did you even take the time to read what I said? Or to actually understand it?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:34:11
Are you sending more than $1000 dollars? Because fees for smaller amounts make it worthless to send money. Why would I send $50 to a friend and pay $11 in fees, and have to wait possibly a week or more? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:45:40
Exactly fucking this. Btc is killing btc. Even satoshi knew bigger blocks were needed soon before he disappeared.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:14:03
It’s called dips 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:37:06
Yes, as a store of value, sure. But it being a store of value makes it a bad currency. Which in turn will lead it to no longer being a good store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:25:38
Ridiculous fees should be plaguing this sub. These high fees go against everything crypto should be. This whole invest in btc like it’s gold in the 1800’s is ridiculous and it’s killing crypto.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:00:42
It’s more like satoshi’s white paper than the red headed stepchild btc has become.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:03:39
Most exchanges do. Still have to go coinbase(again where I said the fees originate from) - gdax- other exchange.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:09:27
The purpose of crypto is to get away from crazy fees.
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:22:29
No. I mean the mass influx of new users paying 10% or more in fees. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 03:19:36
Right now.. I bought $200 btc in mid December and paid $18 in fees. Seeing how seg is still in infancy and lightning is still a sparkle in someone’s eye, we’re going to hit these fees again and it’s sickening.
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:17:30
Fees got crazy for new users on coinbase. The number one used app to buy btc during our last bull run.
@_date: 2018-05-02 22:36:53
Well I mean look at the 1 day. We’re out of the down trend
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:10:54

@_date: 2019-08-28 19:26:26
Hey you must be pretty happy
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:03:04
I can agree to that.. but -21% in less than a month and breaking 10k support doesn’t look great. I think we’re back to mid June prices now? By all means buy the dip. I just think I’ll wait a few more dips.

All over the damn place now lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:10:38
Speaking of which, I lost my virginity yesterday around 6.6 luckily enough, was my first usd-btc bank account transfer any different from any more in the future? I’m processing until the 22nd. Is 8 days guaranteed? Or will it sometimes get pushed through earlier? And at what point to I need to get a hard wallet thing for my keys, so that I can get off coincase and secure my actual coins? I’m sorry for the questions, and if you or anyone have any tips they wish they had known when they first began, please share them with a beginner! I’ll be sure to pass it on when I talk others into investing.  
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:45:09

@_date: 2017-11-14 17:07:39
Any reason to expect a dip between now and then?edit: I understand that you can’t know, I just didn’t know if any news was scheduled to drop 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:54:26
Try gdax instead of coinbase. It’s a sister company. Your login will be the same. You’ll have better security, and an easier way to transfer funds to alt coins in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:16:26
New to this, any word on when this could or would happen?
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:14:51

@_date: 2017-11-17 04:51:22
Nah fam
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:54:56
As is bittrex for me at least. And gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:43:31
Well.. you’re not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:21:32
I know, and I love you the same. I wish nothing but the best for anybody, even if your coin is stupid.
Edit /s on that last part before anyone thinks I’m serious.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:15:26

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:00:31
When you buy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:35:30
Why not just use gdax and coinbase together? Add funds to coinbase and direct transfer to gdax with no tax.

*it’s easy to be a dick*
I’m sure newcomers will be just as heartened to see the kind and knowledgeable discussion that goes on in this sub. Maybe one day it’ll stop being moon and lambo memes. In the meantime good luck with your investments.
@_date: 2019-04-24 03:01:24
It’s been easy money honestly. Especially in the big run. Some coins shot up 1000% btc jumped 200%. Btc climbs while alts fall, stagger buys until the trend reversed, alts shoot up, btc lowers, stagger buys rinse repeat.
@_date: 2019-04-24 23:37:42
I’m assuming you’re referring to me regarding the misleading comment? When I asked if it was still a plan of a plan because I had not seen a roadmap and then clarified by stating that I have been out of crypto for a while? Yeah... I’m the asshole here.
With a name like hashabc, it might help your cause to be informative to a dummdumm like me. Makes you look like a condescending joke to be honest.

@_date: 2018-03-15 03:59:52
Make sure the knife is sharp.

He really doesn’t. He’s either a troll or I feel really really sorry for him.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:18:51
Call everyone son, try not to get offended. Down 100? Looks like it’s down 1,100, in a downward trend with a possible double bottom if it hits 5.8-6 which would be nice. Quite simple really, the people that bought at 19k are the normal people in the world. They got burnt pretty damn bad I’d say and have probably lost interest until we have sustained upward growth, volume is lower than it’s been in a year, but you’re probably right. Go all in m8.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:59:19
