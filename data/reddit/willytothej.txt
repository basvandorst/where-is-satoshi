I have BTC in Bitfinex. Will I receive Segwit2x when the fork occurs?
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:58:45
I DID!

I don't think this was leaked! I think it was meant to be seen by reddit!

Maybe a mod for the PC version if it ever comes out &lt;3 
Some please make Bitcoin tycoon! 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:34:24
I am all for Bitcoin but shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:09:34
Very nice! &lt;3 good luck!

What are the risks of using blockchain.info?
@_date: 2015-02-26 13:07:00
I usually use blockchain.info to store when I have them so should be okay and I will do! No more skipping the windows update for a week haha.

Okay :) I don't have any bitcoins anyway so I will be fine! Poor struggling student aha. I would love to buy some soon though if I get a job when I graduate. The expansion of use in the UK is increasing day by day! Hopefully we will see this increase more. 
KUDOS for the Trezor by the way. Was it worth the hype? They look mint!

Thanks! I have checked my ports and I should be fine! I do most of my hosting using dreamhost!

:) I have messaged everyone who asked for one and will send them out tomorrow :D I am from the UK and they are all to america! hahaha. I am going to be an even poorer student! haha! 
Now if only I could pay for the postage and card in bitcoins! haha 
MERRY CHRISTMAS!
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:52:15

@_date: 2013-12-09 22:22:30
Thanks guys! This is amazing! Might even make a online store that uses bitcoin! :D I am a web developer! :D Should I make it purely bitcoin? :) 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:04:00
She is just clueless!
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:58:25
I want to share the christmas! I never send christmas cards and I thought it would be a nice idea! :D
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:21:13
