Yeah, that's not true at all. Majority of the cryptocurrencies still have their value pegged to bitcoin and if bitcoin tanks, they almost all do.

The user above is asking what people mean when they say don't keep your bitcoins on an exchange, so I answered that and let him know that you're talking shit.

Don't feel bad, even many people who work at these exchanges find it hard to master understanding the concept.

Bitcoin isn't meant to be an investment, it's currency or a store of value. It's entire purpose is to be outside the government and to restore financial sovereignty to individuals instead of being at the behest of a third party. Price discovery is happening, and 1 million per bitcoin while it seems farfetched is actually not so unreasonable when you realise they're divisible to 8 decimal places.
People are viewing it from the perspective of the current status quo, and hence saying things like "it's not backed by a government", yet that is completely missing the point of it being trustless, decentralized, and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:46:01
I guess this is a philosophical difference. I wouldn't identify myself as libertarian however I do agree with certain points they make under certain circumstances. Please don't put me in a box.
The currencies you're talking about require such management since being divorced from the gold standard. They're floated on an international market. Governmental decisions affect the price.
However, the invisible hand doesn't mean people consciously need to regulate things, the invisible hand is just the market at large. Thousands and thousands of people making small decisions based on their own personal circumstances which equate to large movements.
The Bitcoin protocol and blockchain has never been robbed. People have however lost access to their funds to others due to poor security practices.
People do wish their money was censorship resistant. Why do you need to be dictated what you can and can't spend it on? Why do you need third parties to facilitate all of your transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:09:59
I think you have your wires crossed. I didn't answer his question about which exchange because that's up to the individual but to keep your coins safe while you aren't actively trading you definitely should not keep them on an exchange unless your holding is negligible.
N.B. this applies to any coin, including Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:55:09

Why is lightning network a poor design? Do you know how routers work?
Why is the whitepaper considered immutable?
Why do you think centralisation at the base layer of the bitcoin protocol would allow less centralisation further up?
Have you seen the discussion between the LTC dev and miners about how they forcefully would not allow segwit as it's against their interest? (I.e. less fees to collect on chain)
Do you honestly think a blocksize alone would allow the transaction volume of a payment processor like Visa without succumbing to centralisation?
If you dont think decentralisation is important, why do you even care about crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:17
Don't listen to the other guy. Yes, they mean put it in a secure wallet.

Consider the power of electricity to run the network and mine new blocks. There is a tangible price value associated with trading bitcoin. If the price fell and it was no longer worth spending the money on electricity then bitcoin would die.

Bitcoin is secure and distributed across a blockchain with far more power behind it than any other altcoin.
Layer two solutions, of which there are bound to be many eventually, can facilitate the fast transactions you're looking for.  Two days until that's possible. The better Bitcoin is already upon us.

I started a wallet using mSIGNA over a year ago.
I have control of the private keys, but they use P2SH for transactions and as such appear to have an account/key combination that makes it seem as though you may only recover your wallet using mSIGNA.
I was thinking that because mSIGNA is effectively a thin client which can connect to any running Bitcoin node, that I could recover my wallet while mSIGNA is connected to a node running Bitcoin ABC and I can use that to transact my Bitcoin Cash. Does anyone know if this would or would not work?

1. Gearing up for futures.
2. Loads of buying pressure as new money enters the market. This is 100% what should be happening when Bitcoin reaches critical mass because of it's scarcity.
3. 10,000 USD is a significant psychological barrier. It's understandable to think that it's going to pull back because, well, it usually does when it breaches a barrier like this. It happened at all the good milestone numbers.

It's a risk management tool, that is also regulated. Remember that Bitcoin isn't regulated and is historically easily manipulated.
If I sold you a future for bitcoin at a price of 15k with a maturity date 1 month in the future, if the price of bitcoin is 13k at that point you will have to buy it from me at 15k and lose money. If the price is 20k in a month you would buy it off me for 15k and make money.
It adds some certainty to the volatility and that's what the traders want so they can hedge their risk. I personally think it's a good thing as it adds further legitimacy to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:13
50% is back to 5k which is where we were like 2 months ago.

Buy price and sell price are different and this happens when entered as limit orders within the orderbook. The difference between them is called the spread, and the amount of orders is the depth. They are prices that will sit there until someone comes along and decides to be a counterparty to that order and therefore execute a trade at that price.
If you buy at market price, you will pay the best current price that someone is willing to sell it for. If they do not have the full quantity that you wished to buy, you will fill the entire quantity of the first order and start to buy the rest of your bitcoin order from the second best order at their selling price. It is this action of limit orders filling and the next price becoming best price that causes the price to move up, the inverse happens with selling (and causes the price to go down.)

How is the liquidity low? Last I checked Bitcoin traded almost 10 Billion USD worth in the last 24hrs.

I think you misunderstand what futures are. CME is one of the largest derivative marketplaces in the world. They issue the contracts and you buy or sell off someone else via their exchange and contract. You can go either long or short on a future. On maturity date you have to execute the contract at the agreed price. They're cash settled though so no one will be buying bitcoin to make up their settlement obligations.
I highly doubt they would have any knowledge of a crackdown, and if they did why would they issue a financial product on an underlying product that is about to be cracked down on?
