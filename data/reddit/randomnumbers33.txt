and i have no issue with that lol, just because a trend exists doesnt mean it cant be broken. Now a new trend can be formed. If it stays above 8200 and breaks 8500 id be shocked if it didnt start to near 9k.

Well clearly there is an long term upward trend, its trading at like 30000% since inception. that doesn't mean you should buy whenever you feel like it. There are ways to use charts where you can make educated guesses on good times to buy and sell. Anyone can see bitcoin hit resistance around 5800. Do you think that number just arose magically? It happened by finding a bottom, testing and testing that bottom multiple times.

TA is literally used by the algos that trade bitcoin daily. No its not as reliable as something like a stock equity but if you dont believe there are trends of resistance in bitcoin your being ignorant. Anyone with eyes can see the trends that form in bitcoin maybe it has sporadic jumps that can not be accounted for but for the most part TA can be used to make educated assumptions of where the price is moving.

Wouldn't mind a dip back under 7k to buy some more

take some time to learn chart analysis its not very difficult to see trends with resistance

lol im about to stop even viewing this board because you are all incredibly emotional "investors" My statement is still valid. No trend has been broken. If it breaks and holds 8200 a trend will be broken and more upside is expected. My bad for posting actual incite instead of just freaking out with every 5% move

Looks like its heading down to test 7300. If it bounces back up and holds above thats a strong bullish signal if it breaks below 7300 and stays there were looking to test 6k again

Well what are you using to make an educated assumption of where the price is heading?
