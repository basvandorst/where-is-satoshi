Is it really confirmed that it wasn't? I might be out of the loop then. Any sources you can point me to?

Really? Then why has Apple lied before? Like in the case of tracking locations?

I can't take his word for it, though. That's like a thief defending himself by swearing he didn't do it.

No, the biggest flaw was that they allowed brute forcing. Even dictionary attack doesn't help you if you don't allow it.

We need to establish Bitcoin superiority in trading new rare wofls! We can't let this market go to that wretched *dogecoin*!

Every sane internet company makes a limit on number of inquires. So you can try maybe 1 password each 5 seconds. Many even limit number of consecutive wrong guesses That slows you down so much it's not a realistic approach.

Yep, they just forgot to do it in this one login form or where was it, and bam. iCloud leaks.

Sure, but the question was if there was an exploit. There was.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:13:20
I know it's an old discussion, but for the posterity, I disagree. There are tools available today, such as TAILS, Tor, Bitcoin and modern cryptography to name just few, that allow a person to remain literally untraceable.
It's just that it's really, *really* hard not to screw any one small thing up. And that's how they get you.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:01:03
No there was, they had a bug that allowed to brute force the passwords. I.e. you could try say 1000 different passwords each second. So they just went through them all.

Wrong subreddit.

One vote doesn't count, so no vote doesn't count, right? If there's more people that would like less spending, there's gonna be less spending. Plus especially in Israel, I'd pay taxes for the army that keeps arabs off my lawn :)

Is it possible to buy from your site with okpay without being verified? I really don't want no internet site have proof of my identity, address and my mobile phone. I don't want to transfer funds there if I'm not going to use them on your site.
@_date: 2012-01-05 10:05:45
Yes, that's the standard practise.

Yours gives you wars for it. Sometimes more than one at the same time! Give credit where credit is due.

I think you should pay your taxes you owe the state which takes care of you throughout all your life, and then donate to charities of your own choosing. Or move to other state with lower taxes, if you're a libertarian.

You don't live in those countries. You live in a country that provides for you (Canada), you owe them taxes for services rendered. It doesn't matter that you disagree, if you do, change something, run for congress, vote differently.

I'm curious, how much can you get if you run it on a Intel i5 desktop, 4GB RAM, GeForce 450 for an hour (or day/week/month whatever you can guess better) roughly?
Any rough estimate you can give me will do.

1. I might have highjacked a comment, not a post, I believe. Or is top comment also considered a post? Not a native speaker here.
2. I was thinking about joining, and I needed help, so I asked. I don't think it hurt anybody in any way.

That seems so crazy. Why don't all these credit card companies, debit card issuers, paypal and such just make an option where I agree to no chargebacks?
I spent this whole day searching for an easy way to buy just a few bitcoins (around 5 BTC), but the transaction costs are horrible + I'm not from the US :-/
@_date: 2012-01-04 23:38:11
Could you translate that into at least some order of magnitude of monthly pay? From what I found somewhere, it's about 1 bitcoin/month, at which price I'm not sure how it would be economical for people to mine.

So you are saying Earth is only as old as the English language? :)

Well, not exactly. Yes, the dollar is worth what "we" decide it is, but the "we" here is the US Government. Because the reason everybody has to use dollars is because taxes are payed in it. You can't pay taxes with anything else. Therefore it has value.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:14:51
That's awesome! :D
Is that possible, do they have the option to give out loans possibly? :D
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:21:02
Because if all goes well (for bitcoin), a lot of really powerful people will be really angry with it.
So far, governments and banks have extraordinary control of currency, and through that the whole economy. With bitcoin, they basically have nothing to control it. And that's not gonna go well with any government.
I fully expect the US government will try and maybe even succeed in making bitcoin illegal in the next 10 years.

Exactly. Zero irony. It's to be rather expected actually. They are competitors.

Thank you for a nice explanation.
I realized after my post that my plan is all peachy if only one can really tell if it's the bubble bursting, or just a fluctuation. Damn, that's just a minor detail! :)

Why buying and not selling?
Wouldn't it be better to sell everything right when you're sure it's going down, and then rebuy when the market rebounces?
