To my knowledge Newnote Financial bought the company, disposed of the founders and then got delisted by the BC Securities Commission. So far I've gotten emails for about 15 missing bitcoins. If anybody would like to join in and consolidate their claims, please let me know.

Our group has submitted several offers to purchase this exchange with every intention of making things right. We never understood the lack of urgency to get anything done. We would like to have an idea of their liabilities. Please send an email to contact

No need to. Paul has been quietly paying rather than face potential criminal penalties

the 2 way machines have some cash to dispense. the one way machines are usually cleared out at the end of the day so there's not much to steal.

I heard that they're trying to kick out bitcoin ATM pioneer Bitcoiniacs. I think it's I going to be an interesting fight to watch. Bitcoiniacs founders sold Cointrader for $1.5M and Bitcoiniacs just got a foreign investor who owns a bank. I heard they're going to roll out 40 ATM machines that don't need scanners, they even print paper wallets. I just bought Bitcoin from their machine and it is charging 0% commission. I thought there was a mistake, I put $400 in and normally expect to get like $380 or $390 worth of bitcoin. My blockchain wallet showed $401. We need more people like them.

I just paid for coffees and a pastry, but an accidental touch by the cashier turned C$11.7 into BTC11.7 The store owner is my buddy, but Blockchain Merchant did not forward the coins to his wallet. They're now holding on to BTC11.7 plus C$11.7
