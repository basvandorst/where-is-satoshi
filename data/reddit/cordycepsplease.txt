I'm always wondering how insurance could be provided on a blockchain service.  A benefit of centralization is that they usually help you out if something gets stolen.  I agree with you there are some aspects of centralization that are good, but some are bad as we all know.

It doesn't cost anything to store your bitcoins.  He is probably referring to the blocksize issue, it is costing more in transaction fees because only 1mb can be confirmed about every 10min, the market is so popular that you have to spend a little more to incentivize the miners (like 4 cents right now). For a cold storage you are not going to be paying any fees.  I just bought a trezor the other day and I believe that is a good option for cold storage.  Just research it and I'm sure you'll find the option that is right for you.
Also I wouldn't leave your coins on an exchange as we all know what happened at mt.gox.
Here is a faq if you want to read more about trezor

I never have used coinbase, and I never have had any problems.  I recommend getting your coins out of there.
