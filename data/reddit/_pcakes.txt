I bought at 19k, someone please convince me to buy this dip
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:18:25
I don't have nearly enough in to go broke lol

Okay I was just going off the graph on coinbase and this 19.8 to 13.6 drop, ~30%, appears to be the biggest. I don't plan on selling anyways, unless it somehow hits like 5k where I'll give up
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:08:14
except this dip is a bigger percentage than ever seen before
I bought in at 19.5k and I'm very worried
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:49
I'm no expert but you aren't losing anything if you don't sell
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:46:56
couldn't you just use like paypal or something to avoid this?
@_date: 2018-08-15 08:43:31
you've made more than me so far

samething happens when getting paid in bitcoin just before it drops from $6700 to $6300
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:49:37
if I cash out I'm at a net loss
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:19:45
that doesn't answer his question of how
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:23:20
my initial $100 is up to $50 finally
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:45:52
I bought mine at over 18,000

I bought at 18k and it's been really disappointing. I guess I'll wait until I need the money or it actually goes up, whichever is first
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:12:34
at the time, it had only being going up and up for quite a while, and there was no way to know if it was the peak or maybe just halfway up, so I figured I'd just buy in while it was still moving up...
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:05:25
I bought on december 16th
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:41:41
can I have a gold too?
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:08:26
should I just sell?
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:18:10
it's ok, I didn't put in more than I could part with
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:25:39
I have like 6 more months of patience max
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:00:35
It could also take 50 years to get to 100k, or perhaps it never goes up past 7k again, then I'd be a fool for *not* selling. I want my money within 6 months because I'll be moving out from my parents' house roughly around then
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:19:31
I first bought at 19k 
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:33:35
yeah I bought when it dropped under 6k recently
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:21:16
robinhood better than coinbase though right?
