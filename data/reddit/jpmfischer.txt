Maybe, I just wish I had done a better homework before opening that account..

How much did they let you deposit in fiat at once without holding your money?

In my case they are holding my funds:

I don't need a Tier upgrade, if you saw my account you know I'm level 3 and should be able to transfer fiat up to 25k USD. 
Is there an issue with the deposit? No problem, RETURN the funds to the bank, inform the reason and apology for not being able to comply with the rules for whatever reason. THAT is the BEST case scenario if it does't take weeks (or months).
Every exchange or company, specially fintech companies relies on legacy financial institutions, don't they? This is no excuse for what you have been doing.
No serious exchange can tell their customer their money will be held, ask for some vague "proof of certain level of income" and to wait until somebody eventually find the time to look and decide something. Not a sign of company good practices and standards.
About this "certain proof of income" and why I am repeatedly asking Kraken to return my funds back to my bank:
 - Will the "proof of income" I am able to provide be enough for some highness to decide to give my money back? Once you have it, how much more time will you take to decide that?
 - My mother language is not english, my annual income declaration is in portuguese. kraken, the question is: Should I expect you to read and understand that paperwork faster than it's taken for you to answer plain english??
I support all levels of verification to mitigate bank risk and frauds. But that is just not how it's done. 
Anyway, today Robert from the support finally sent a message that was not automated general apologies, informing he would ask Paycash to return my funds to my bank account.
Let's see. 
Meanwhile, still not trading, just waiting...

Yes, I am a Tier 3 customer and according with their own rules I should be able to make up to 25k USD deposit per day.
I am worried about this kind of attitude because one may wonder if USD 15k is too much money for a customer to deposit that it gets hold for such a long time... Couldn't they be using all this money to create "all this volume they've been doing" (as you said)?
Could also try to believe 15k is higher than the average deposits they are used to receive, etc... But what kind of company punish and ignore the customer for trying to spend/trade too much? Does that make any sense?
I am just not able to convince myself they are "too busy" to deal with 15k USD deposits, neither that suddenly now your Tier 3 user need to deliver a "certain proof of income"...
Anyway, one thing is certain: 2 weeks later no sign of my money...

I opened an account this year because I wanted to trade Ether, plus Kraken having offices in Europe, Canada and USA somehow made me feel safer than Bitfinex in Asia. 
That was stupid, now I know. Really know...
I have never had a single issue with other exchanges, wire deposits from Europe go to bitfinex bank in Taipei and clears in less than 72 hours. Anyway, I was afraid of letting all my money with them.. and I really wanted to trade ether too...
Well, they started trading Ether this last week. Already making profits!!  \o/\o/\o/\o/

Can't tell if that is true, but just got a feedback from kraken.
