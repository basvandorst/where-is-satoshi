This is what I get for keeping my bitcoin in a exchange like said. It's impossible to take it out, no matter where it's going. 
Everytime I try it says "根据监管部门的要求，该功能正在升级，详情请查看公告" which translates roughly to "The function you are trying to use is unavailable due to the requirements of the upgrade by the regulatory authority. Please see the announcements for details"

They had no idea, I mean, no one can, but they know I am American, there's actually quite a lot of expats here that use Bitcoin as a remittance method, so the first time I tried to send that large amount of bitcoin, it sent up red flags at Huobi. The Chinese government wants expats to use the bank method of remittance with the annoying tax restrictions and such in order to ensure legality of sending money overseas (along with a large fee from the bank... &gt;.&gt;)

American here, living in China, and regularly trade on Huobi. I knew this was coming a long time ago, I just didn't know when. I once tried to send Bitcoin to my Kraken account as a way of remittance (the laws here in China for RMB remittance are so horrible, have to show every bit of taxes was paid in stamped and approved receipts, and you can't transfer more than 100k RMB at a time). When I tried to transfer it to Kraken (to then sell and withdraw USD), Huobi gave me a notification that said “有账户风险，请联系客服”, Your account has risk, please contact customer service. Anyway long story short, the customer service rep lady kept telling me the government is really putting the pressure on them to keep Bitcoin in China, and not transfer them out. After Skyping them to prove I was in fact the true holder of the passport photo I uploaded as verification, the restriction was lifted, and I sent my few months worth of paychecks back to the US where I wanted it.
 The China Central Bank's reserves are at a historical lows, I'm imagining this along with money laundering is the reason for these new restrictions.

The official news post in English from Huobi

Up like 300+ RMB since the news was posted, US markets are on the same upswing.

I think if you're going to hodl, best to do it in a private or hardware wallet.

it depends a lot on your personal financial situation, personally I think for someone that is earning a decent living and has a savings more than 100k USD, investing 20% of that (around 3 BTC at current rates) can be a good basis, but it's all speculation, bitcoin is more volatile than the stock market, and people lose thousands on the stock market, and i know many people that invested at 19k + and we're stuck at 6500 right now. 
historically bitcoin is still at a high point right now, but compared to the 19k we saw 9 months ago, i personally say it's a good time to buy in, a lot of people on this subreddit will say any time is a good time to buy in, but in reality you need to do your own research, educate yourself on not only the bitcoin markets, but on the underlying technology of bitcoin, because that's what makes bitcoin... bitcoin, thats why we have seen this crypto-asset booming in recent years. do not take my advice and just run with it, please for the love of god do your research, invest what you can lose, and hodl, bitcoin is a long term asset for me, and for a lot of people

This could be great to churn credit cards, just charge $5000 to your card, get the bonus, watch bitcoin go up in price above 5% (hopefully) and sell, get your money, and pay off your credit card.

I'm just excited to see my bitcoin stuck in the exchange to go back up to USD prices again (or even more like before...) since the price has been *2-3k CNY* undervalued in the exchange due to not being able to withdraw... 
but i'm not holding my breath on a timely implementation on the withdrawal option, thinking end of summer/beginning of fall type of thing.
