The explanation-video doesnt need sound it just needs your voice.

Yes same here, but before I knew Bitcoin I didnt save anything.

Just wait, give them a little more time. When it comes to money, switzerland can be pretty complicated  - I run a small cryptocompany and we struggle to open a bankaccount because normal banks won‘t let us bc we are trading cryptofunds. For us, swissquote will be a plus.

People today are stupid, you cannot publish any software online without getting questions like how does it work ? - even if there are tons of videos on youtube. 
Its a nice piece of software and i‘d love to use it!

Definitely the best answer! 
1. Get a book or a learning-app (i think my first app was sololearn). 
2. Get some skills in python or java. 
3. Get some freelance-jobs or get some skills in daytrading and develop your own tradingbot.
I promise you will never regret, its worth every second of your time. I wish you all the best!

If you ask a employee for explanation they dont have a clue what bitcoin is, the dont even know that sbb sells bitcoin. Once I tried to buy some and the price was 1650 CHF and that was 20% above bitstampprices. You can buy bitcoin but you cannot pay sbb-tickets with bitcoin so basically its just another way to get your money.

SEPA-withdrawal on bitstamp is still 90cent for me. Can you provide a link?
EDIT: just found it myself

If you need low deposit fees go to bitstamp and use SEPA

I would like to trade on Kraken but I wasn‘t able to use your API because of the 2fa, which I need to send as a part of the postrequest. I really love the idea to be 2fa secured using your API! But I only have the google authenticator on my mobile phone and dont know any solution for windows. When I search through google there are tons of examples for 2fa - I have my own 2fa now to secure my software even with qr-code generation but still cant manage to get my 6digits as a string into my code. 
I work with c# and already checked the example-project. 
Ah and there are working solutions for 
Binance/Bitfinex/Bitstamp/Bittrex in c# if anyone interested - pm. (They all dont work with 2fa for api-users).
A big thanks to JKorf here. Your a small god and the reason why developing tradingbots for cryptocurrencies is such a big fun! Would love to have a coffee with you - pm me if you see this. 
Explanation of the problem for beginners: If you login on exchanges you need 2fa. If you make trades through KrakenAPI you can use this 2fa security to secure your http-requests. Problem: Cant manage to put my phone inside the computer.
