You're right that my account shows an account verification deposit and withdrawal.  It also shows that my account is verified but that $1000 have not been deposited into my account by coinbase.

I emailed their support email twice and wrote them a letter.  I did not receive a response.  They have 20.881 of my bitcoin, which is worth $1948 based on the current market price.  No deposits have been made to my bank account beyond the verification.

Thank you for sharing this information. I would have held off on using their services had such accounts been known.

I sent the following on March 20th with no response:
As of this morning, now 6 days since receiving the bitcoins for this instant cashout, the USD are not in my bank account.  I understand if there's a technical glitch but I would appreciate a little more transparency as $1000 is a tidy sum to have lost.
Thank you,

Apparently I can't -- reddit keeps throwing 502 and 504 errors when I dry to submit the message.  I just sent you the following via the contact form on 
Hi, thank you for your response on reddit.  The email on my account is [redacted] -- I appreciate you looking in to this and hope this issue can be resolved quickly and agreeably.

I have a few more btc to cash out and will be evaluating your platform. Sorry for thinking coinbase was processing transactions for wordpress and not your service.
