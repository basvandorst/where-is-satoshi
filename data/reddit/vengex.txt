Maybe they mean risk free in the sense of CFDs you are not holding your own Crypto/private keys so you cannot be hacked/scammed/mistype addresses in the same way.

I know, you know that but people new to Crypto don't understand and that it is why they often end up buying into this type of site instead of actual Crypto.

He is talking about blockchain, I think his analogy was a little off. If you consider the web the platform that email runs on and blockchain is the platform that Bitcoin runs on- in this case he should have actually said that  Bitcoin is the email of blockchain but that is not as catchy. Bitcoin is a perfect use case for blockchain but it is far from all it will revolutionise.

Very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near black holes, will distort time. Watch Interstellar if you have not, it is explained in the film.

If Bitcoin Cash can cause a Bitcoin sell off, maybe ETC is more likely to cause an ETH sell off? (ETC also ofc)

But -90% more stupid, amirite guys?

You are aware computers can run android and privacy focused Linux distros which are just as secure and that mouse and keyboard will beat the shit out of virtually any other input devices when you can use them properly?

What if I told you the correction may not have completed? There is a pretty big head and shoulders forming currently. Are you sure you want to risk being responsible for losing people money by encouraging them to hold instead getting them to manage their risk to the downside?
