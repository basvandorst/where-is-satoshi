You've got me confused here.  I'm as savvy at ~~reading entrails~~ technical analysis as the next fellow, but I have some problems with your charting: 
1. The **Leaning W** at the peak indicates strong support levels for volume sellers from Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Waterloo.  But as we all know Napoleon got his ass kicked at Waterloo, which implies these sellers are going to take a bath.  
2. Climbing just before the peak, I see two **Angry Shoulders**, which indicate a breakout run up over the baselines.  But in the American League, your manager can now indicate a deliberate base-on-balls, which means any batter who isn't holding altcoins can take a base without being pitched to.  If the batter leaves the base-path, is there any reason to think the baselines are valid anymore?  If the number of pitches declines, won't there be fewer sales jobs?  
3.  The two diverging straight lines on the chart pivot off a **Half-Empty Cup with Handle** on 13 November, but *my* software says it's actually a **Half-Full Cup with Handle**.  Should I be aiming for the descending line with its purple arrow, or is that just a leftover icon from your DDR sprites pack?    
4. The **Melting Candlestick** formation augurs well as long as the Moon is in Virgo, but since Pluto is no longer a planet, I suspect my star-charts are out of date.  Can you really do valid analysis without updated mass/momentum charts and Feynman diagrams for the stellar bodies in Bitcoin's sphere of influence?

Coinbase at 14.4 and wobbling hard.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:08:46
So I just put in a Coinbase transaction that puts me "perma-black" -- I sold enough BTC to get back my initial speculative play.  That transaction will clear in five days.  
If I sign up and buy BTC on Bitstamp today, and then immediately send it to my Coinbase account, I don't think I can get my coins moved around fast enough to take advantage.  
Now I could do it like *hawallah* -- basically tracking my books offline -- so I would set up a "sell" transaction on Coinbase at the same time I set up the "buy" on BitStamp.  But then I'd need to transfer the coins from BitStamp to Coinbase to balance the books, and that transfer could be immediate or very slow.

- A piece on the [Internet Research Agency]( discussing how they generated stories about Ukraine with bylines and content intended to appear Ukrainian, creating a spectrum of "gray" lies ranging from opinion pieces with pseudonymous authors to outright fabricated stories intended to be picked up by conspiracy-peddling outlets    
- Bellingcat routinely [disproves the lies]( put out by the Russian MoD regarding Ukraine 
- [This baseless story on ZeroHedge]( about the gold going missing from Ukraine's central bank was dissected in detail by investigative journalists and used as part of an in-depth analysis to [conclusively demonstrate]( that ZH is acting as an amplifier for Russian disinformation.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the aim of that story was to weaken the Ukrainian economy at a time when they were likely borrowing money for defense spending.

I saw *two* Exit Stickies back to back, though, and since an Exit Sticky is always a single closer for an Angry Shoulder, I am confident that you're just seeing support levels form around the Hog's Entrails.  You can consult the runes if you like, but we already know that BTC $20K is destiny.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:59:51
Okay, but so how can I buy BTCs at $14K on Coinbase and sell them for $16K to someone on bithumb?  I feel like I could move BTC around for a day playing just that arbitrage... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:14
Yeah, but it makes *selling* on Coinbase super lucrative.  If you sent me BTC at 1HdWhK741pAzBMs94z1TSJcCkowAHHcrZM from another exchange, right now I could get something like $18k or $19k for it once it cleared.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:35
It's back to $15.5 and oscillating hard.  I suspect that people who believe in "support levels" have all collectively hallucinated $16K as a magic number, and we're going to oscillate around it for a while before rocketing through $20K tonight.  
Alternatively, one of them may notice a "cup with handle" or "gremlin's ear" or maybe "angry shoulder" formation, and head for the exits, and tonight we'll be back at $10K.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:15
Coinbase was briefly showing $19K, so yeah, they're having traffic.

Ah, the ol' WHATABOUT - how does one write that in Cyrillic again?  
Look, "both sides" arguments are fundamentally disingenuous.   They change the subject and the burden of proof, and they are aimed at convincing the audience that it is hopeless -- *all* entities are corrupt, *nobody* has a monopoly on truth, *everyone* does that -- because those outcomes favor the shittiest person in the room.  They cast objectively evil behavior in a better light, which only really helps people who are interested in continuing to get away with bad behavior.  
But so, to address your (flimsy) point, there is a substantial difference.  Jeff Bezos asking the editor of the WaPo to put the kibosh on labor-friendly editorials^1 is substantially different from Vladimir Putin funding an office building full of people who invent fictional events, chronicle them under pseudonymous bylines, and push them out to a variety of outlets using off-the-books payments^2 .  
You do see the distinction between a conflict of interest and deliberately manufacturing lies, right?    
^(1.  There is no evidence that this occurs, and the *Washington Post* is a trusted publication in part because of its editorial independence from its board, unlike, say, Rupert Murdoch's hard-right rags.)

You could do it like *hawallah*, but it would require substantial capital.  Spread $3,000 across those three markets (a week ago).  You have $1,000 in BTC on each market.  They rise at different rates, so now you have more in CEX.io than you had last week.  The average is 14,185 -- so you take $670 from CEX.io and move it to GDAX and Poloniex to bring each up to 14,185.  
Now, that approach just creates a hedging effect -- you get the average return of all three.  If you really wanted to maximize your arbitrage, you could send your BTC from CEX.io  and GDAX into the Poloniex wallet.  Once the transaction is approved, cash out Poloniex into dollars and then buy equal quantities across all exchanges again.
I don't know how long an individual set of transactions would take, but the part that makes me nervous is how much of the float you'd be risking -- if one of these markets is artificially high because it's a scam or a Ponzi, you'd move your cash right into the trap.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:16
Nope.  If I already had accounts on multiple exchanges I'd absolutely be participating in the arbitrage.

Given the number of retail businesses that are willing to devote a few seconds of employee effort to testing *any* $20 / $50 / $100 bill with the tester pens, and the cost-per-hour of employee effort, we can make some assumptions about the prevalence of counterfeit bills.  
(I asked a shop employee about the practice and she said that the week they started testing was the week *after* they got soaked for a few hundred dollars in fakes.  They caught one or two fakes and then nobody tried to pass fakes in their business anymore.)

But if you push the algorithm to a neighborhood where COTS GPUs can do the work, then the people who are currently using their economic leverage to buy specialty chips (ASICs) will just switch to using their economic leverage to buy GPUs wholesale.  You think MSI cares if the order they're filling is 3000 boards to NewEgg or 3000 boards to BitMinerLLC?  
The same people who have the capital to invest in ASICs will find the hardware that has the best return on investment, and they will use their capital to secure an economy of scale purchase of that hardware.  You saw the price spike (and supply deficit) for the Radeon boards this winter, right?

I can think of several reasons to use the blockchain as a source for instructions: 
1. My targets will keep it up to date for me and go out of their way to keep AV software from deleting it or scanning it.  
2. Any target that has the instructions file also is ripe for stealing BTC from. 
3. Any target that *does not* have the instructions won't do anything suspicious, reducing my overall footprint.

Whatever change you make to the algorithm, the people who are currently invested in ASICs will likely display the most agile response to the change.  As soon as the proposed change(s) go public, they will perform an ROI analysis that is dynamically linked to hardware prices; they will purchase, *in bulk*, as much of the best-bang-for-buck hardware as they can source.  Then they will use the same capital and leverage they used to buy ASICs to buy wholesale contracts with the manufacturers of the BBFB hardware.  
They will also see if they can get a wholesale contract on a higher-performing piece of hardware, such that the wholesale price makes it a more attractive purchase.  
These people have more capital to invest, which lets them control the means of production.  (That phrase might ring a bell.)  Unless you establish an unfair advantage -- e.g. find a rule that favors one particular kind of hardware and buy it in advance -- they will continue to eat your lunch by buying bigger guns, mining more coin, and re-investing that coin in better mining equipment.

His information theory isn't great though.  If he can check the X-Ray from earth, then so can someone else.  Launching a static file into orbit with no comms capability doesn't make sense, because the file can't be read back as a check; however if the file *can* be read back as a check, then it doesn't matter if it's on a satellite or somewhere else.  If it's readable, then it's networked, and a person who can impersonate him can read the file.  Now there may be good checks on this -- link encryption, message-level encryption, filesystem encryption at the satellite -- even security through obscurity and forcing an adversary to reverse-engineer your C-Band satellite communication protocol helps deter an attacker.  
But you'd almost be better off taking a hard drive image (maybe that's the term he meant -- I can see that phrase getting translated to "X-ray" by someone who doesn't know what imaging is) and storing it on read-only media like DVDs.

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:06:28


That assumes they still have access to the wallet-generation codebase.  This reads like a pretty novel software supply chain attack (whether by an inside developer or an outside attacker).  The benefit to the attack is that the attack surface grows over time and across the user base, so eventually the attacker can be confident of making (say) $50/day with occasional big scores.  
Foiling this ought to be done as you suggest, but with a submission form letting users who *do* find compromised addresses able to submit a comment saying when/where/how they generated the address.  Once that source for addresses is "burned" the attacker will have to start over, but the access the attacker has to that codebase will be worthless because nobody will trust that *particular* codebase.  (If we do find it, we should get a copy and submit it to VirusTotal as well, so that a modified version can't be stood up with a different name.)  
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:53:23
Which part of the explanation is incorrect?  Sorry, I didn't follow.
I think even with client-side JS, it's still possible they're hashing low-entropy memory, although I agree that it seems weird to do that on purpose, because why would they even load transaction addresses into memory?  
A malicious developer could say in a code review (e.g.) "well, we need a source of good entropy for these hashes, so let's just grab the last 100 transaction IDs and use those bytes" and justify it that way, but the flaw in that reasoning *ought* to be obvious to his peers.  There might be an obfuscation step - "oh, we'll splice these N strings together, and furthermore we'll only take every Nth byte" - which could result in a stage magician's NOP-like shuffle?  I don't know.  It's confounding and suspicious, I agree.  Still not ruling out malice *or* incompetence.   
But please don't think I'm being disagreeable - or rather, please correct me if I'm bugging you! I don't disagree with anything you've said yet &amp; am very interested.

@_date: 2017-11-30 13:11:18
If I were an attacker, "accidentally" hashing low-entropy memory would be a really great and plausible way to hide this attack in a code review.  
If you look at the Linux kernel backdoor attempt in 2003, it's the same kind of *allllmost*-plausible bug -- once you start digging it becomes obvious that it's an attack.  "Oh, it's just an **=** vs. **==** error!  That happens to be during someone checking whether their privilege level is root.  And was committed to the codebase outside the normal commit process."  
It could be that a clever person figured out that some people might do this, and decided to go looking for buried treasure like OP did... but this really smells to me like an attack.

It's worse than "weren't properly randomized".  Someone's address generation code is malicious in a way that allows them to steal from users of their software.  If the user base for *that software* is small, no big deal... but if the user base for that software is large, and an appreciable fraction of the new people entering the BTC market get their coins stolen, then it impacts the public perception of BTC... which will lower the price and the value.
