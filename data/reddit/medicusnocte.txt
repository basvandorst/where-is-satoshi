Bravo.  This prompt fact-checking and rational thought is very refreshing and appreciated.

The Complaint &amp; Jury Demand states on page 1: *"Dave, a paralyzed IT security expert in Palm Beach, Florida, communicated almost exclusively through various private email accounts."*  So his health had been poor for years.  He suffered this spinal cord injury in 1987 during a motorcycle accident.  He died 26 years later (2013).
Here is a 2015 paper entitled ["The Strange Life and Death of Dave Kleiman, A Computer Genius Linked to Bitcoin's Origins"](  The paper by Andy Cush states *"Less than a month later, Dave Kleiman was found dead in his home. According to reports provided by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner Office, the scene of Kleiman’s death was gruesome. His body was decomposing, there were wheelchair tracks of blood and fecal matter, open bottles of alcohol, and a loaded handgun next to him. A bullet hole in his mattress would seem to suggest suicide or foul play, but no ammunition casings were found, meaning he might have fired his gun and cleaned up sometime before dying. The official cause of death is listed as natural, and Conrad remembers hearing that the MRSA had stopped Kleiman’s heart."*
Yes, people can certainly die of MRSA severe sepsis. But that does not explain the loaded gun, the bullet hole in mattress, or the absent bullet casings. The paper does not mention whether Kleiman had a bullet hole in his body. I presume not since it says "The official cause of death is listed as natural, and Conrad remembers hearing that the MRSA had stopped Kleiman’s heart."
Beyond the mysteries of this story, it is a cautionary tale for all of us on this forum: money does not bring happiness. *"He holed up in his home and refused most contact from outsiders, including formerly close friends ... open bottles of alcohol, and a loaded handgun next to him."*  That does not sound like happiness.  It sounds like a sad ending to ones life.  **A Million BTC do not guarantee happiness.**  At 2011 prices ($2-12) that would have $2-24M.  Today ($10,100) that 1.1M BTC would (is) worth $11B.  Wow.  That amount of money can make people do very crazy things.

But CW is the defendant.
