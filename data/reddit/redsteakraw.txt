Like I said there is no incentive to the individual, they need to transfer to a new wallet and get whacked by the sky high fees.  Segwit as a solution was too little and way too late, and asked too much of the network to become effective without much of an immediate reward.  Segwit as a solution, is a failure it isn't working and given the fees it isn't going to gain much anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:58:05
Not in practice, it assumes a large transition in order to be an effective increase with little to no incentives for the individuals in the short term.  A real blocksize increase was needed and is still needed to hold everything over.  Who wants to move over to a new Segwit wallet with these high transaction fees?  
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:35:10
If only the block size was larger these sorts of news simply wouldn't happen.  Bitcoin cash is increasing it's merchants and acceptance while bitcoin core is losing it.  Lightning network or not the blocksize should have been increased before Lightning network is ready so there is a smooth transition.  Slow confirmations and expensive fees are not what many signed up for when they got into bitcoin, it was for many what they were getting away from on the legacy payment networks.  Who wanted a more expensive and slower digital western union?

This sort of pie in the sky well future bitcoin if this works kind of thinking isn't panning out.  People won't take a loss for segwit for segwit sake.  They need to have some sort of immediate benefit.  As a user who would have to pay a huge fee to switch to segwit what do I gain? ATM not much there is no lightning or layer benefits there is no benefit and only a loss.  Meanwhile the solution has not motivated much adoption and the Mempool is a mess the network simply isn't working well at all transactions are failing.  The blocksize needs to be increased and the layer 2 and other fixes can come later.

The article is sparse and doesn't portray him as being rather notable(a standard for having a page).  The content I saw looks like it would be better served as part of the bitcoin foundation's page.  Now if this is expanded and a case for notability is expressed then there is a case for the page remaining.  I just don't see the point in this case.

Swiss banks have done this but this is usually done by banks that don't lend(IE you don't ever have any worries of bank runs or default).  If this bank is making money on loans then this is a straight up scam.

There is kind of one, there is a system where you need 2 / 3 of the keys to sign off on the transaction.  An arbiter is sent one of the keys if both the seller and buyer agree then they both sign off and everything goes well.  If they don't they take the dispute to the arbiter then the arbiter signs who ever's keys that wins the dispute.

No middlemen, and the ability to control your own store.  It really sucks when other people restrict what you can sell or dick you around.  When you go with a hosted solution you are at their mercy.  As for Vaporware it is actively being developed and mostly works all ready.

You basically listed hypothetical solutions which have yet to really pan out.  B Cash has other solutions as well such as Graphene, sharding, Bitcoin-NG, Parallel validation / Merkel trees.  But unlike B Core B Cash is doing actions now that solve problems and keep the network running.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:26:23
B core has yet to implement any real solution, the Mempool has been a disaster for over a year.  I don't know how they feel it is acceptable.  They push a patent encumbered segwit, and it does not have much of an effect on the Mempool.  At this point something is better than nothing, and ignoring the problem.  B Core needs to put up or shut up.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:41:36
Lets say Segwit gets near 100% adoption it will only double the capacity, which still would be less transactions than B cash.  Which would make Segwit closer to linear scaling than B cash.  So again even if I take your word linear scaling is not a solution, B Core has yet to roll out a solution.  Do you really think B Core not addressing the problem of scaling in any meaningful way is acceptable? The status quo has not been acceptable, Segwit as it stands has not done enough, and there still is no grand or killer app use case for Segwit thus little to no incentive to push adoption which should have been anticipated.  Furthermore Segwit's patents make it it so the patent holders can legally choke off projects that utilise it.  I see this as a very conserning problem in and of itself seperate from the scaling problems.  So where is the solution?  
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:19:14
B Cash will be Bitcoin, just give it a bit more time.  Bitcoin core did not fix it's scaling problems.  First Segwit would solve it and it didn't.  Bitcoin is growing but the software isn't scaling.  There is the hint of X on top of Segwit would fix it but it is always off.  There was not a solution BEFORE there was a problem, and the Core devs seemed to not care.  People switching to B Cash is voting with their wallets, mining and mindshare.  Some people are sick of high transaction  fees and want a scalable usable Bitcoin NOW.  I was extremely disappointed that I could not justify using bitcoin for purchases at Porcfest like what was doable in past years.  What stores will want to accept bitcoin if the fees will scare off most of the potential customers that have bitcoin?  The whitepaper clearly envisioned bitcoin being the cash replacement, not some settlement layer.  Now people are starting to see the whitepaper was right and the new direction core wants to push simply isn't working.  Mind you I wanted it to work but it simply isn't.  People are being pushed towards alt coins which can be used as a settlement layer and cash which begs the question why stick with Bitcoin Core?  Core has coasted on it's first mover advantage for far too long.

The main thing is that the cores can't just run threads from the OS they have to be specifically programmed for it so it isn't going to be usefull for the average person.  The only good thing is that it is cheap to get ones feet wet in parallel computing, so one could look at this as a raspberry pi of parallel computing.  So it has a purpose just not the over hyped purpose many have incorectly have been lead to believe.

Money is a commodity if it is adopted an accepted more it's usefulness as a medium of exchange is increased.  If more and more people demand bitcoins it can drive bitcoin exchange prices up.  This can be in spite of the increase of bitcoins, also the amount of future bitcoins is [limited at 21 million](  Think of it like this, I have famous cookies if not many people want them and I make a lot of them then the price must be lowered to sell the rest of the cookies.  If there is a rising demand overtime I can make more and more cookies at the same price.  This is the case as long as the demand is still at the same rate as the increased production(inflation) the price of the cookies (bitcoins).  So you could have more cookies in circulation at the same price before the increased production.  If the demand is higher than the production then the prices go up.

Inflation is not need for an Economy.  It is needed if you have an entity that want's to centrally plan the economy.  Bitcoins will just be divided into smaller and smaller amounts.  You don't necessarily need to buy in but you could accept bitcoins as payments.  Thus you trade for Bitcoins through your labor or other goods.  What would be good is a system that uses smart phones to negotiate transfers.  Making it easier to make transactions in real life (tm).

No the value per bitcoin would be what it is traded at there just would be more people in the bitcoin economy.  Price devaluation is offset by a constant increasing demand.  However you could make the point that it is decreasing in value at the same rate as the Dollar.  I think over a period of time if this is stable it will start to rise at more or less inflation rate of the Dollar.

No bank needed, it is easier to transfer large sums of money without fees.  It also is very easy to transer funds online or to people you don't know.  Right now if you wanted to sell something you would have to go through some unsavory third party that would process credit cards and then could hold your cash ransom like paypal is notorious for doing.  With bitcoins it is a direct transaction all digital and online no middleman needed.  As it stands it is one of the simplest forms of wealth trasfer you can do online once you already have bitcoins.

For me the biggest arguments against bitcoin would be no protection against [Shor's algorithm]( should a quantum computer be made.  EDIT Grover's Algorithm halfs the brute force attack, shor's algorithm doesn't apply to AES but none the less one should be aware of the possible vulnerabilities due to quantum computing.
Another potential counter argument is that since there is a record of every exchange you ever made, if your bitcoin account  is traced back to a person a lot of information can be gleaned as well as governments could use it as a record against you.
