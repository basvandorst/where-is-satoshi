Not getting greedy is very important and plays hand in hand with managing risk. If you try to milk your trades for every last cent then you're going to get rekt most of the time.

Thank you kind sir, your comment was what inspired me to make mine! In this market currently it’s pretty tough to day trade on the smaller time scales such as the 5m and 15m and you really do have to be on your game as you said. At this time I’ve been trading from the 4h and 1H time scales. Buying the dips and those huge impulse moves to the downside have been my bread and butter lately.
