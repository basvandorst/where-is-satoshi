When you get into the nit and grit of traditional finance it is much more complex than bitcoin. To transfer money between banks is an incredibly over engineered system, requiring several checks, as well as several days before it can be authorized and funds moved. Bitcoin does it in a few minutes max. I don't even care to shill crypto anymore. All the information is there. It's like willfully buying a new ice vehicle in 2019 when you can buy a superior vehicle (electric) that will save you all kinds of money.

2008 was considered a "real recession" and even a great one to many.. nobody here needed basic resources. Some didn't have jobs for awhile and had to remortgage houses and shit like that, but nobody was fighting for resources. 
 
Bitcoin will pump through a recession, so will shiny rocks. Which is why holding both is a good idea. That happening is more likely than needing basic resources, at least here in the first world.
