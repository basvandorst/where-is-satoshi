I hate Ru Paul. I worked on Ron Paul's Presidential run.
Everytime He called a press conference, Ru Paul would show up, and turn the event into a clown show.
The press would swarm around the drag queen, and ignore the man running for President,...except to front page any comment he made about Ru.
Of course the establishment was looking for any excuse to tank the candidacy of the ONE person who wanted to balance to budget, and return to sound money.
Ru Paul decided attention to his sexual perversion was more important than the fate of this nation.

There are several reasons for that.
1. The assessed value is usually low as it's not vigorously raised unless the house is sold, there are several exemptions that limit the tax, including homestead. So while the gross rate might be high the actual paid amount isnt.
2. The State property tax, isn't the whole picture. Schools have a separate tax that varies by district, and there is a surcharge to support schools in poorer districts.
3. County, and city, and utilities also are funded by property taxes. The upside is your property tax is the ONE tax you pay, the downside is it is a sizable tax. 
There have been efforts to reform the "Robin Hood", property tax which adds a surcharge to wealthier neighborhoods. But so far reform has been unsuccessful.

No, it only translates to wealth for average citizens in a fair, and free market. 
In a free country the first Venezuelan citizen that opened a screw factory, or pipe fitting warehouse across the street from the oil refinery would be Venezuela's first Billionaire.
In the US hundreds of small businesses spring up along the oil pipelines, welders, fast food, barbers, safety shoe supply, hotels, electrical supply, etc....
Banks, and Walmarts soon follow, and local economy booms as jobs become plentiful, and wages skyrocket. 
Bars, restaurants, and shopping centers spring up to give workers a place to spend their new paychecks.
And hundreds of minimum wage jobs for younger workers not qualified to work on the pipeline. 
Without the corruption of Hugo Chaves, the oil export money would have eventually trickled through the economy, and the income, and wealth of the Venezuela working class would have improved,....as it did for Belize, And Costa Rica.

You can't starve the person selling you food, ....and oil with an embargo. 
US companies stopped bringing food, and goods to Venezuela when they started seizing it, (nationalize, redistribute), instead of buying it.

Blame Trump,....really?
This started under Bush, and continued under Obama. 
Before Hugo Chaves Venezuela had more oil exports than Saudi Arabia. 
Then the Socialist government seized all the oil wells, and refineries, and kicked foreign oil workers, (experts) out of the country.
Oil production quickly dropped to ZERO. Hard to export, or "embargo", something that does not exist.
Promises of free stuff drove out all other businesses. Hard to compete with "free".
Have a bakery? You are now ordered to work all day to give your bread away for free.
Then you have no money for flour.
Now there is no food. 
The government fixes the problem by printing more money.
Now you see the basic problem with Socialism. It's all about productivity, money is just a place marker that has no value without things to buy.
There is NO US embargo with Venezuela. You want to sell them food? Go ahead, oh they will be paying you with currency worth 1 millionth a Euro.
You want to become a Billionaire? I'll send you a Zimbabwe  $1 billion dollar note. For awhile everyone in Zimbabwe was a billionaire, ...still couldn't afford to buy food.
A better plan would be to use modern farming to increase food production, then they could feed everyone. 
They would still be poor, but no one starves.

Yes, I checked Snopes. It says this is False, then below, yes he golfed with Tiger woods, and yes he spent $3.6 million that weekend, but the GOA cost schedule is misleading. 
So yes, Presidents golf going back to at least Nixon, and according to Snopes the money spent by Trump is "misleading".

Let me explain this to you.
Me taking my paycheck to the car dealer, and using it to buy a car = not theft.
The car dealer driving to my work, and taking my paycheck from boss' desk, and later leaving a car in my driveway = THEFT.
What's missing? Consent.
Taking someone's money without consent is theft.
You mentioned "benefits of Society".
Police, I agree to fund them, and pay LOCAL taxes to do so, and vote on those tax rates.
Roads, I pay a surcharge on every gallon of gas I buy to fund them, and choose how much I wish to pay every time I fill up.
Defense, everyone benefits, but we spend most of our "defense" budget defending the rest of the world, and can no longer defend our own borders.
I didn't choose "wealth redistribution", or the funding of a $4 Trillion dollar bureaucracy that seizes, "steals without consent", half of my paycheck, and now even taxes my health insurance, and medical care.
And the group of people who benefit the most, "inner city poor", pay nothing for these benefits.
That's where taxes cross the line between a cost for the benefit of society, and THEFT.
The US Federal government has stomped that line to oblivion.

So when you solve the hash you get 12.5 bitcoin? How are these created, how do you get them?
Let's say someone sends 1000 bitcoin to someone else, you generate the winning hash, is the new block 1012.5 bitcoin transferred? And you get the extra? I thought this didn't happen every block,  and only special random blocks created new bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:09:37

@_date: 2018-03-31 20:45:38
I'm still learning about crypto, it is my understanding that sometimes when a hash is processed a new bitcoin is created.

Life is enough of an incentive to spend. I'd like to stop eating 6 months to wait for the price of groceries to go down, but that's not an option.
The thing is even 1% investments have some risk, and the level of risk goes up dramatically over the inflation rate.
On average investments pay far less than inflation, this isn't theory, this is the last 50 years up to today.
Inflation over just the last 10 years has put another 10% of our workforce under the poverty line.
Minimum wage workers are now trying to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour. I used to work as a computer programmer at $11 an hour, and lived comfortably in luxury housing, and a brand new sports car. Now a family of 4 with that income is put on food stamps.
The simple fact is wages don't keep up with inflation. Social security doesn't keep up with inflation, neither does investments, and retirement savings, or any other segment of our economy outside of government that gets to spend the newly printed money before it inflates.
On your last point I agree with you. Bit coins need to be spent to become commonly accepted as a currency, otherwise it's like rare gold coins you keep in a vault in your basement. It doesn't matter how much they are worth, because you will never spend them anyway, and no Walmart will take them.

Since income taxes are taken from your paycheck from your employer there will be no difference there either.
They may have slightly more trouble verifying miscellaneous sources of income, like when you sell your used stuff at a yard sale, or run a Chinese opium trafficking ring.
The rest of us will be taxed as usual.

Some would argue making money available in 30 year bonds for people's mortgages at 3% is productive. But with a 5 - 10% inflation you are bleeding wealth to do so.
What about periods where inflation was over 70%, you got any 75+% investments I can buy, or is as you stated a 69% investment is just "unproductive money"?

I see an entropy death in the future. 
Right now transactions are verified by miners.
Miners mine because of a random reward of more bitcoins.
Right now mining is tight on profitability because of competition. 
As bitcoins become more scarce, there will reach a point where it costs more to mine, than the bitcoins received. And no more miners.
2nd when you run out of all 21 million coins, how do you add more blocks?
I have a fair tech background, but am a noob.
I'm thinking of setting up a mine, simply because I have tons of computing power laying around mostly used to conquer the galaxy in various online games. 
If I get a bit coin a year, that's doing better than a lottery ticket, and the games net nothing.

So again, what happened to Medicaid, and free clinics?
As far as poor not being able to get out of their situation, we give education free through high school.
There ARE things we can do to bring back manufacturing jobs, and other jobs that a high school education can qualify you for. But that is a different issue from healthcare.
The problem currently with healthcare is minimum wage workers, and many lower middle class workers can no longer afford to buy health insurance. 
Laws, Regulations and exploding medical costs is putting it out of reach.
The question then is are we going to go full Socialist, and "tax the rich", as you just proposed, or are we going to go back to where EVERYONE with a job could afford basic health insurance?
As far as the "lazy" poor, I run some rental property with section 8, you really have no idea about the word lazy.

Keep telling yourself that. 
During the crash I kept hearing the same exact thing, over, and over. "Too big to fail".
Glas Steagal created a firewall between the customer banking, and investment banks. 
This prevented B of A from selling insurance, or betting your checking account in the stock market. 
The overturn of Glas Steagal allowed the creation of Fannie Mae which before that banks lent there OWN money to mortgages, and were very careful to only lend to people who could pay them back, after the creation of Fannie Mae, they were lending the Government's money with no consequences,......to them. 
Anyone with half a brain could have seen the train wreck a mile away.
Currently the insurance industry is in the same exact shape as the banking industry was in 2007, and the savings, and loans in 1984.
Yes, you heard it here first folks, in the next few years the insurance industry is going bankrupt, and will require a Trillion dollar bail out from the taxpayer. Barring a complete overhaul; including a complete repeal of Obamacare, and ALL of its conditions.

I think we can agree the rich are taken care of.
The old are on a government solution already.
The middle class used to be ok, but are now in trouble because of being asked to pay for the poor.
I can afford my own family's medical bills barely, there is no way I can afford a doubling.
That leaves the poor, they believe they deserve the same medical treatment as the rich, but they want the middle class to pay for it.
What happened to MEDICAID? Free clinics?
How did a working medical system with solutions for every class become so broke?

Wrong. If everyone is prosperous, absent currency manipulation, that means everyone has increased production. That means prices will go down because goods, and services are more plentiful. 
You are conflating wealth, with money.
I can give you two immediate examples of deflation that did NOT occur during a recession. 
Gas, and computers. Fuel prices dropped with the invention of fracking greatly increasing the production of existing wells, computers get smaller, faster, and cheaper according to Moore's law on technology progress.
Deflations in modern times are almost always caused by credit contractions, and inflations by printing excess money, or deficit spending by government. 
The economic "laws", you were taught in school haven't been valid in our lifetimes, and are continued to be taught as propaganda to cover up government malfeasance.

The value of a currency isn't it's value related to other currencies, it is the value of trading for goods, and services. 
Right now, I can go to many businesses, and pay with PayPal. 
So far I haven't seen many signs that say "we take bitcoin".
The real value of bitcoin won't be the number of people who own it, but the number if people that spend it.
To understand this, you need to live in a border town where several countries currency is accepted. 
When one of the countries inflates it's currency businesses simply refuse to take it. That currency then has no value, except in its ability to be exchanged for a valid currency at either the official, or black market exchange rate.
So ultimately it is in the hands if the gas station owners, and shop keepers that the value if the currency rests.
You see the same thing in the USA with competing credit cards.
The more card holders, the more businesses pay the fee to accept it. The more businesses that take it, the more customers apply for it.

OK it's not exactly 20 years to the day, little things like a world War can skew the dates. 
Take a 200 year graph of our economy,  and every 20 year period will have one or two crashes,  + or - 5 years.
This apparently during the period a "central bank" was supposed to be preventing them.

No you are wrong. Inflation is a tax on ALL wealth. If inflation is 5%, and you invest, and earn 6% you just got taxed 85%, and only gained 1%.
If it's parked in an investment that makes less than inflation, too bad for you.

The middle class in the USA need 90% of after tax income for living, leaving 10% for retirement saving, only to find the $25,000 you saved for retirement  which 30 years ago was enough to buy a mid priced house, is now not even enough to buy cat food.

The discussion was net return, not intrest.
I'm aware in theory in an unmanipulated capital market, interest rates are supposed to follow future inflation rates. 
The last 8 years in the USA interest rates were held artificially low in a misguided attempt to kickstart the economy.
This left savings accounts, and other savings vehicles available to the average consumer substantially below even the official inflation rate, which drastically understated the effect of quantitative easements, and actual consumer costs.
Energy costs have been slow to climb, not because inflation stopped, but because fracking dramatically increased production of existing wells.
If you look at metals, and building materials you get a better picture of actual inflation that more closely tracks the money supply expansion.

Manufacturing jobs aren't coming back when a company can pay a Chinese dude .10c a day, then bring it back to the USA tax free.
Automation didn't kill those jobs, an upside down tax system drove them to other countries. 
When did most jobs earn you enough to buy insurance? 1985. 
When you have several million unemployed college students why hire someone with just a high school education? Especially when it's cheaper to just hire an illegal.
