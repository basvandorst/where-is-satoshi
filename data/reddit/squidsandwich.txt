Right and so is 1% of 32 trillion being 320 billion. It's an absurd notion and is thus a circle jerk of the highest magnitude.

Yes definitely understandable. The real problem with a lot of the people on this subreddit was that they had this notion that BTCs would rise to infinite levels for all of eternity.
I want to see them turned into something useful, besides just making a quick buck or two. Congrats to those who cashed out at 250, but I do feel bad for those who bought IN at 250.

Woosh?

No, I sure did read it correctly. The 1% have the money in offshore bank accounts. Your average joe does not.
@_date: 2013-07-07 20:04:09
"many uses": Right. The entire post is talking about we should encourage the 1% to take their hidden money in offshore bank accounts and buy bitcoins with them. Clearly, that's talking about it's "many uses".
"potential profit": Guys, If only we could convince the richest 1% of people in the world to put all of their money into a PROVEN BY THE PAST YEAR'S RESULTS unstable currency virtual currency, by some magic mechanism, it will be worth the arbitrary value of 15,000 USD/BTC!

I'd rather directly use it to support the company directly and to encourage the use of bitcoins without the need of a man in the middle. This is how a vibrant economy of BTCs will be made: many users and vendors using the coins.

Thank you!

Brilliant! Next can you tell me that the sky is blue? How about that water is wet? That every day in the week ends in Y?
It's people like you that are essentially at the heart of the bitcoin problem: you're in it to make a quick buck. Some of us actually want to use it for other purposes such as buying legitimate items. The bitcoin economy will only ever be taken seriously when people start using it as currency for goods and services.

How's the jerk going for everyone?

You apparently didn't read the part where I want a printer. Not the printing materials.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:38:51
I wasn't honestly suggesting that we could. I was pointing out the circle jerk going on in this thread.
EDIT: Also, reading the entire sentence basically shows that I was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:54:43
Are you actually arguing what the word "all" means in a sarcastic post?
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:29:41
Yeah a quick Google search didn't really come up with anything. Everything I saw was for companies who sell the filaments and/or 3d printed materials. I'm specifically looking for a printer.
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:55:32
So what? I want bitcoins to be used as an alternative currency, and my wanting to buy a 3d printer with THEM supports that idea. If everyone only has bitcoins as a currency that they trade amongst themselves, there's essentially little real reason to use it (EDIT: besides for "alternative practices"). I want bitcoins to become a legitimate form of currency used to purchase goods and services.
