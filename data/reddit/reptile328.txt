I'm the journalist who wrote this article about the origin of the HODL meme and about crypto subreddits. I was happy when "GameKyuubi" answered me some questions, since most of the previous articles about him just cited his original post.
Since my article is in German, here are at least the quotes from "GameKyuubi" in English (which is their original language anyway, since he is from California):
"I wasn't exactly in the best situation at the time so nights I distracted myself with a cheap plastic bottle of blended whisky"
"We all want to leave our mark on the world in one way or another. I never imagined this would be my contribution but I'll take it, haha."
"Everyone knows the phrase but few know me by name, so in crypto circles I often forego my name entirely and just introduce myself as "the hodler" and that's good enough."
"I met Roger Ver and Vitalik Buterin, and I must say it was pretty cool to see the looks on their faces when I introduced myself and they recognized who I was."
"Well, history has shown that the crypto gods are, on average, most generous to those who hodl coins with solid fundamentals and innovative ideas. I try to keep this as my core tenet for crypto investment and I've been pretty successful so far. Staring down a wall of red is always a tough feeling but I really believe in what crypto as a whole has to offer so I manage to keep my finger off the "panic sell" button."
"I try to keep my rent low, I bike everywhere I can, and I usually cook for myself."
" Crypto, if handled properly, can be the most difficult thing to steal from you. More difficult than your wallet, more difficult than your house, more difficult than your life."
