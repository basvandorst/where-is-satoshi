Thanks a bunch!
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:43:52
I was called a troll and downvoted for mentioning this. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:00:22
Sure. 
But you act like it's a certainty that the price will rise. It isn't. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:52:37
What!? No Bitcoin option? This is an outrage! Lynch them!
@_date: 2014-11-26 08:25:58
This will somehow turn into a Bitcoin circle jerk i assume?
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:35:40
We all know nobody here cares about the prize. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 12:39:06
That little spike was because of the tipping recently but now we're at normal levels again. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:27:00
Nick 123152 who just replied to you and downvoted you is also him. His 4th nick in this topic. Feel free to report him. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:29:47
Unbelievable. People really are dumb beyond words. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:29:53
He will now call you a troll. That chart is correct and anybody who says something else is a troll. Or probably paid shill. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:31:40
We really don't need you adding stuff to the original title. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:10:06
What do you mean? Just do a search. This has been posted over and over again for at least a week already. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:38:58
Exactly. Yet you get upvoted and i get downvoted. This place...
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:32:37
People are that pathetic??
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:20:43
Agree. This is pretty bad. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 17:52:16
Another day, another cringe fest. 
Bitcoin would be better off if this sub got closed down asap. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:06:58
So HUGE that noone cares. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:31:22
You're insane. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:48:15
Right, because i didn't join your ridiculous circle jerk i must hate freedom and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:40:48
How did they get access to your computer?
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:13:33
Right. That explains thing. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 05:26:17
Stop smoking. 
You already posted this nonsense topic by the way. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:59:40
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:11:29
Nobody knows if it will be the future of money. Really. Not even you.
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:09:54
What an outrage! Lynch them! Why is CNN not reporting on this yet! Someone call the Bitcoin police!
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:54:06
Ok, look i fully understand that. Do you really not understand my question? You wouldn't be able to answer it anyway, only the op can. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:50:32
It's ridiculous. If this is what Bitcoin needs then it already failed. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 21:59:20
What's the issue? You either pay your taxes or not. Your choice. You might get in trouble or not. Just like with any other form of money. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:29:07
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:14:58
How is this relevant to my question?
@_date: 2014-11-20 16:37:10
Calm down. Look at your post. You said not to use your computer to buy things online. 
1: that's something different than " don't hold large amounts of money on your computer". 
2 : that would make Bitcoin useless. 
So i was right to post what i did and you were wrong for getting all upset by my reply. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:35:53
The lies and bullshit on this forum are getting worse by the day. 
I really hope the price goes back up soon because this is getting real fucking sad. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:28:29
And high value?
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:26:14
We can't all be so intelligent as you. Please don't look down on us dummies. 
I'm gonna study some history and technology now so hopefully in the future i can talk to you on your high level. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:24:28
I think after 50 different articles in the last 10 days you can stop posting about this. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:45:05
Stop smoking. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:36:28
Is there some kind of time limit before i can say such a thing?
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:26:30
So in the end western union is faster, easier and cheaper. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:23:00
I'm sure you'll get far in life with your attitude. 
Take the amount of money you're gonna collect through this post as a hint. 
And no. Asking for proof isn't insulting in any way. That you actually think this makes me wonder if there is something wrong with you. You're way of thinking is really odd. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:11:21
What is the hidden message? Because the internet didn't fail neither will Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:39:07
I'm not sure i understand you correctly. Are you somehow blaming blockchain.info for those phishing sites? 
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:04:48
They should've used Bitcoin instead. That way you'll never lose your money to hackers. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:50:10
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:19:59
What the hell are you talking about? Who said that?
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:27:33
The internet money of the future shouldn't have to be locked up offline in a cold wallet. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 04:24:50
Paid by who??
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:34:27
This quality topic is 80% upvoted. I think it belongs on the mainpage. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:03:46
Yes. Mainly that this sub is one big circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 03:28:24
Your internet doesn't have Google?
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:31:38
Your "team" is probably a bunch of 20 year old amateurs. Scam or not it's clear this is a very amateurish operation that will soon be closed. Probably with people's money. 
You have no experience in sales and pr and have no idea what you are doing. You already made so many rookie mistakes in your original message. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 20:52:53
Why did he pick you? He wouldn't go through all that if he didn't know you had quite some coins i'd assume. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:36:21
I love my Mastercard. Instant transactions, easy and fee free payments that are insured and protection against theft. Until Bitcoin reaches that status i will keep using my card. But feel free to cut yours in half. 
It's also quite hilarious how this sub attacks everything and everyone that doesn't like or use Bitcoin but when someone attacks Bitcoin everyone here goes absolutely nuts and starts crying about it 24/7. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 08:10:05
He didn't pay with Bitcoin because he wanted buyer protection. Most likely if he paid with Bitcoin the seller would have scammed him out of the money and leave him with nothing. That's why he prefers to use Paypal now and in 5 years from now. 
Besides that he also wanted to pay instantly instead of spending 2 days figuring out where to buy Bitcoin and learning how to use it and then after buying it losing 20 bucks because Bitcoin went down. 
Of course the usual downvoting. At least tell me where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:27:07
Tldr: get help 
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:20:07
Just do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:52:04
But he is balanced so don't worry. Don't be so negative. 
It's clearly a very balanced, rational and clear thinking guy who knows what he's doing. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:04:13
Just change the word "paying" to "donating" and you suddenly are not a pyramid scheme anymore. The fact that you are seriously saying this and seriously expect us to trust you is hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 01:47:08
This is posted here why exactly?
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:25:21
I have no idea what you are trying to do or say. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:59:49
Shill for what exactly??
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:22:53
My god...
Yes i know! I know how the blockchain works! I also know it doesn't list his name, email and ip besides it! Neither does it list which computers are easy to hack into!
Please stop answering me. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:25:58
Same thing. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:52:05
The general public. 
If it's Bitcoin related we'll see it by reading the article. If it isn't then it doesn't belong here. 
You don't need to add stuff to the title trying to convince us. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 00:13:23
Because someone made some nonsense chart?
@_date: 2014-11-24 06:03:25
Every other day this same question :(
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:04:57
Step 1: get someone who speaks proper English. 
Step 2: try not to sound like a ponzi. Saying you are not a ponzi usually translates to this is a ponzi. 
Everything about your sales pitch screams amateur and ponzi and no one in his right mind will send you even a penny. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:00:11
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:24:48
Looks legit. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 18:05:13
And guess what. Logging in stuff and entering passwords is exactly what Bitcoin users do through Tor. 
Yeah i'm such a troll for mentioning that. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:02:20
Really?? Please tell us more. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:54:30
Well, if that happened there then it surely must be happening in this sub as well. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:08:00
Yeah. It's doing amazing. Only went down 70% or so.
But let's just cherry pick images like this and circle jerk about it. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:10:13
Uh wow. Great reasoning and logic. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:57:37
Bitcoin can die. Stop being so delusional. I highly doubt it will but it can die. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:00:03
No. Your behavior is absurd! I'm still sitting here wondering wtf just happened. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:54:06
You'll notice how it's awefully quiet in here. Let me explain why. No betting site uses 0 confirmations because it's unsafe. And 1 confirmation mean 10 mins to 1 hour of confirmation which makes mainstream adoption highly unlikely. Noone here is gonna admit that so they simply ignore posts like yours. 
Rule 1: we don't talk about confirmation times. 
Rule 2: see rule 1. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:38:28
I found about 7 of his fake nicks so far. This guy is everywhere. He does a lot of vote and thread manipulation. 
That out of all people he is (falsely) accusing people of being shills is hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:37:27
Yet you figured you'd start a thread about it and make it appear like a fact. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:16:23
And that's why as long as this isn't fixed Bitcoin won't go mainstream. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 10:16:44
I have a few online stores (coffee and some other stuff) and noticed exactly the same thing. It went from several sales a week to maybe 1 a month now. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:56:05
Why even bother placing bids below the market price?
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:47:33
Wow, circle jerk fail. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:24:51
Oh guess what. Pizzaface and Coincrazy are one and the same person. 
Yup, the person calling me a paid shill and what not is attacking everyone here with his 2nd nick. 
That explains why Coincrazy went full retard when i made fun of Pizzaface's circle jerk. 
There must be some kind of rule against this right?
Edit: he just attacked me with his 3rd nick called Controlblue. 
Edit 2: his 4th nick in this topic is Edit 3: Exocomp is yet another one of his nicks and Bitttburger might also be one. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:02:32
He's using at least 2 other nicks to attack people and manipulate votes here. That tells you enough about what kind of person we're dealing with here. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:38:12
Who upvotes this shit?
I didn't call him dumb. Wtf are you talking about?? I never praised WU. WU is a horrible company. I never visit Buttcoin. Let alone collect karma there. Once again what the fuck are you talking about? Every single sentence in that post is a lie. Disgusting behavior. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:43:55
Because you are full of shit. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 11:02:35
100 bits is ridiculous and insulting. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:27:12
Just what my mother in India needs. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:47:33
No, you didn't sell 700 coins. You're lying. 
Nobody who spent so much money on Bitcoin has such a negative view on it. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:25:13
No. It's ridiculous to even consider that. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:57:05
The lies and making up shit to attack me is just sickening. That's not calling me out. That's having some serious issues. 
Do you do this in real life as well?
The only thing i did was calling a ridiculous circle jerk ridiculous. The way you attacked me because of that is unheard of. 
I've seen a lot of shit here but you just took it to a whole new level. Absolutely crazy. 
You try to destroy me with lies and bullshit and crazy attacks for being critical of a circle jerk. There is no way you are mentally sane. No fucking way. No normal person would react this way. 
You went completely overboard. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:33:05
You mean the same thing Bitcoiners are trying (and usually failing) to do with other payment systems and fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:45:48
Get ready for the op insulting you for not sending money. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:38:05
I bet people who are new here can't wait to start using Bitcoin after reading this. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:23:54
Exactly. It's when the price goes up that the public starts buying. Not when it goes down for a year. 
But many people here just want it to go down so they can buy a few coins 50 bucks cheaper. 
They expect Bitcoin will go to the moon but want to save a few bucks buying them. It's silly. 
If you think it will go to the moon then just buy now. The 50 bucks difference won't mean nothing in the future. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:23:17
Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:24:14
Good catch. 172 is him for sure. Bitbubbly i'm not sure. 
We're dealing with a serious troll here. I'm willing to bet this is just the tip of the iceberg. The guy even tips his fake alts. 
I'll send you a message how to easily recognize him. 
Funny how all these people are complaining about so called paid shills and buttcoiners. By far the biggest troll on this forum is a delusional Bitcoiner. 
Edit: Bitbubbly is also him and so is @_date: 2014-11-27 07:31:07
Kids on Reddit giving Bitcoin a bad name. 
For example by harassing people who don't accept Bitcoin and spamming everyone with pennies. 
They are the worst pr i've ever seen. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:35:59
Where do i buy one of those crystal balls?
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:33:34
Aaaah now i see what you are saying. Because it is similar (not really but playing along) Bitcoin won't fail either. Correct this time?
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:58:48
No, it isn't good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:26:07
Ok, so because the internet didn't Bitcoin won't fail either. That is your argument?
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:37:06
If you are gonna need 1 confirmation for certain products (other than a house or an expensive car) then Bitcoin will fail as a mainstream payment system. 
Requiring waiting time after paying for every day stuff simply won't work. People won't accept it. 
Edit. Sure, feel free to downvote me to hell but please be polite enough to tell me why. Where am i wrong? Just downvoting things won't solve anything. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 21:50:15
Awefully quiet in here. Wonder why. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:54:37
So you couldn't think of any other place to ask your question? Places like Paypal customer support, the Paypal reddit or one of the many Paypal forums. That's odd. 
Or could it be you posted it here on purpose to start a Bitcoin circle jerk?
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:31:07
I found at least 2 more of his nicks. He also talks to himself a lot. Giving himself compliments. It's sick. It wouldn't surprise me if this guy is using 10+ nicks to troll this place. 
Obviously he uses several nicks to downvote everything he doesn't like and as soon as the other posters see 2 or 3 downvotes they just add to it without thinking. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:21:07
I sure hope you're not older than 13. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:00:36
Where am i wrong?
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:06:54
Sorry, but that is just dumb. 
And did you or someone else seriously just downvote me because i said it isn't certain the price will rise again?
@_date: 2014-11-30 04:27:11
Let me guess. Whatever is said in that article is probably amazing news for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:08:11
I sure hope you are not older than 15. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:20:35
As i noticed from my own stores people simply hardly use Bitcoin anymore. It's getting less every month. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:57:32
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:18:45
Things that stop Bitcoin from mainstream adoption such as security and transaction times are ignored here. We simply don't talk about it. And if you do you get ridiculed and downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 08:08:47
Didn't you see the screengrab i posted. The guy is a lunatic. Ignore him. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:05:49
Upset i cancelled your circle jerk?
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:54:16
Another day, another nutter. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:24:49
Who you think can answer this?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:06:38
Seriously, do you consider what you just did normal behavior? The attacks and the lies? 
Do you consider it normal behavior to attack someone like you just did because he is critical of a circle jerk?
Do you think this is what normal people out there do?
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:14:39
Because not everyone out there understands or believes in Bitcoin. Actually most people don't. 
Also they prefer to get paid using a method that doesn't exclude 99.9% of their potential customers. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:18:21
Stop making such a fool of yourself. It's just pathetic. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:16:53
You are insane. 
I have made exactly ZERO anti Bitcoin posts. 
The nutters are out in full force again. 
This place is truly something else. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:42:09
Your 5th nick in this thread. Congrats. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:31:09
Thank god theft and hacks don't happen in the Bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:16:33
You're too intelligent for us. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 04:48:31
To all those who blindly upvoted him yes please look at my history. I haven't made 1 post trashing Bitcoin. Why would i. I am a big Bitcoin supporter. 
Well known paid shill? Completely delusional. 
He simply is talking shit about me because he tried to start a stupid circle jerk with one of his many other nicks which i laughed at. This is his revenge. He is talking crap about me with at least 5 of his alts. It's sick. 
Don't just blindly upvote people like that. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:40:24
Another day, another nutter. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:55:40
Seriously? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:46:22
If i got a coin for everytime i read here certain news is HUUUUGE and then nothing happens i'd be rich by now. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 11:03:07
Fuck, you're crazy. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:34:26
You seem very insecure. If Bitcoin is this amazing payment system of the future some video by Mastercard should be a non issue. Yet you are extremely upset. So something is obviously wrong. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 04:19:32
This has nothing to do with Gox. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:58:54
Take the hint and stop wasting your hardware. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:58:58
All i know is that i don't speak freaky deaky Dutch. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:47:00
No. It's not reasonable. Nobody has any idea what it will do 5 years from now. It might be dead 2 years from now. 
There is a chance it might be 10k but it's not reasonable to expect it. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:31:30
What am i looking at? Someone who's been into Bitcoin since 2011 posted something about Bitcoin in a thread linked on the mainpage?
@_date: 2014-11-21 05:14:02
Ok i get it. Creating a wallet, wiring money to an exchange, buying bitcoins, send money to another wallet, have that person open an account at an exchange and then have them wire the money to their bank is faster, cheaper and easier than western union. 
Sorry about that, i was kinda confused but those downvotes snapped me back to reality! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-24 00:01:31
Nick  How many more do you have?
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:40:56
Well in 9 out of 10 cases you actually get your money back compared to 0 out 0 cases with Bitcoin. So they are right when they are saying that. 
Why am i being downvoted?
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:14:50
What is a large amount?
@_date: 2014-12-05 09:46:03
Actually they do investigate cases like this thoroughly and if that guy did nothing wrong he most likely did get his money. 
Edit: downvoted because?
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:09:44
It scares me when a mod talks about paid shill propaganda. For some reason i expect the mods not to be as crazy as many of the users here. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 00:26:46
No, he is a bat shit crazy Bitcoin cultist. Bat shit crazy is an understatement really. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:42:39
No it's not. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 07:47:43
You posted this here why?
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:50:48
That's him yes. Let alone the private messages he sends to people. Bat shit crazy. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:15:02
None of my posts are anti Bitcoin. Not one. None! What the hell are you talking about? 
What is it with you people and your insane paranoia?
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:24:45
I have no idea what you are spamming but i can already guarantee that not a single person will earn 312 coins and that your post is bs.

After how many days was i allowed to say this? 30? 60?
@_date: 2014-11-26 17:53:29
Right, and you totally didn't try to start a circle jerk. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:39:59
No, i hope it goes up. I'm tired of it going down. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 22:44:52
9 out 10 times these things are a scam. Stop acting like you're totally surprised why not everyone is blindly sending you money. Is this your first day on the internet or what?
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:20:49
Bitcoin - the money of the internet. 
But don't use your computer!
@_date: 2014-12-05 12:15:52
Edit: who are these people who just keep downvoting every comment i make? 
How old are you? Is this really what your life is about?
@_date: 2014-11-28 07:53:08
These kind of posts pop up 1 or 2 times a month. It's disturbing indeed. 
This sub attracts a lot of crazies. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:15:22
Stop making a fool of yourself. It's so obvious even a blind person would see it. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:34:41
After that you only need to find a place to exchange your coins for money so you can actually do something with it. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 06:01:04
Well untill that time we should pretending Bitcoin is better then. Indeed it has the potential to be better but right now it's useless for most people who rely on things like WU. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:50:36
Exactly! Everyone should know how Bitcoin works! Otherwise we lynch them!
Edit. Do i really need to put a sarcasm tag there? You people and your downvotes. My god. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:49:04
Stop making such a fool of yourself. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 19:51:30
Thanks. And exactly what i was thinking. All those replies and the downvotes instantly confirm my claim. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 02:22:25
Indeed. They were telling me i should buy at 900 because it was very cheap. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:33:24
You forgot to call me a troll and paid shill. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:41:33
How the hell do you expect anyone to tell you what they are worth 1 or 2 years from now? You think anybody here is from the future? Use some common sense. 
And right now they are worth about the registration fee. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:11:15
Get help freak. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:38:02
Yes. I realize such a thing exist. But i have seen ZERO evidence this happens here. Maybe you know more and can show me evidence?
And even if it did happen here (which it doesn't) then the nutters here do way more damage to Bitcoin than any paid shill could ever do. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:54:36
Blockchain isn't stealing shit. 
You on the other hand might get your shit stolen by using Bitcoin through Tor. 
Stop making a fool of yourself. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:50:34
You understand the irony of your post, right?
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:00:28
What the hell?
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:39:54
I didn't delete ONE post. Another lie. 
And that post is far from praising WU. Read the whole conversation and you will see why. 
You're insane. 
Get help man. It is absolutely crazy what you are doing. Completely fucking nuts. 
You are attacking me at an absurd level. Full of lies and bullshit. You call me a paid shill. And why? Because i didn't join a circle jerk. 
I seriously can't believe this is happening. I really can't. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 18:06:58
Because everyone here told new people that $850 was really cheap and were gonna get rich soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:34:01
AND THEN YOU CRINGE!
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:32:19
Can you show me the part where i'm trolling?
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:45:21
They are right. Tor and Bitcoin is a very bad combination. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:46:20
Get help. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:50:41
Where are all these people asking about Bitcoin exactly? All i see is you tipping someone, which he didn't collect, and then you linking it here. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:10:45
Stop making me cringe every time you post. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:29:55
Is this your third nick here? 
Edit:  hilarious. Actually it seems it is. Your non bitcoin nick. 
You have some severe issues. Get help. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:31:35
EDIT: Because people seem to think I'm trying to scam. (really says a lot about your character)
Yeah, because we should blindly trust random people who ask for money. If not you're an evil person with a very bad character. 
Seriously, that sentence alone already makes me not want to send you money. 
If you want donations you present proof of the situation. You don't start with insulting people right away. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 23:54:09
If this was a buttcoiner everyone here would scream outrage. Funny how that works. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 12:09:12
Your first day on the internet?
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:47:37
Between 0 and 100%. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:46:04
And they all gonna move their money into a currency that lost 70% of its value in the last 12 months. Right?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:27:35
Since pizzaface18 is your other nick i'd say you are the one trolling. 
Sad. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:41:25
OP, can you point out 1 paid troll here? Just one. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:57:20
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:07:49
The harsh reality. Don't expect too many upvotes. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:37:03
We're just not on your high level of critical and logical thinking. Sorry. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:57:14
Are you sober right now?
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:59:23
The problem is that basically everyone who is critical of certain aspects of Bitcoin is called a troll. 
You can deny that all you want, and you will, but i see it happening here every day. 
The op is 100% right. This sub has a huge problem being open to criticism. I have a feeling in most cases it's because of mental self protection. "If there is a flaw somewhere i might not get rich off these 5 coins i own, better call him a troll and reject everything he says". 
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:56:32
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:11:31
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:12:51
Right. They should do it for free! Shame on them for trying to make money! Bitcoiners should get it free!
@_date: 2014-12-04 11:53:36
Of course. This place is known for its unbiased Paypal support. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 14:02:58
Because it can't be simply a troll, right. He has to be paid. 
Seriously, you have issues. You nutters are the real problem here. Bitcoin would be better off without all the crazy cultists. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:22:27
Welcome to the internet. I got my first phishing mail 15 years ago or so. Since then i ignored them. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 07:16:47
Obviously you wouldn't dump it on the market. But you should have no problem selling it. 
These people don't care if what they say is true. They just take every opportunity to shit on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 05:56:01
If someone steals your wallet do you also sue the bank?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:35:15
It's not confirmed yet everyone should ban them. Seriously?
Why am i being downvoted?
@_date: 2014-11-29 18:03:19
And we wonder why mainstream adoption just isn't happening. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:37:54
How dare they! This is an outrage!
@_date: 2014-12-05 10:46:00
Did your master Alex Jones tell you this?
@_date: 2014-12-10 20:17:43
Did you just use Google translate or something?
And please stop trying to convince us. Your site is pyramid 101 and will soon dissapear with the money just like the 1000's of similar sites before you. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:34:03
No. And i'm not even gonna explain how unlikely it is. Use some common sense. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 19:58:06
Sure. We are all trolls because we don't share your unreasonable views. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 06:49:45
He is a complete psycho who has been banned here with several nicks. 
Someone posted some pm's this guy sent. It was seriously fucking scary. It's safe to say he simply he insane. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:09:03
No shit. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:17:21
So nobody will tell me why i'm being downvoted to hell?
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:10:23
What a suprise. The other totally crazy cultist is defending him. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:57:01
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:32:23
I didn't call him dumb. Wtf are you talking about??
I never praised WU. WU is a horrible company. 
I never visit Buttcoin. Let alone collect karma there. Once again what the fuck are you talking about?
Really? You're gonna lie and make up shit about me, a fellow Bitcoiner, just because i'm critical of a stupid circle jerk? You have some serious issues man. Your level of paranoia and other mental disorders is very worrying. 
The other day i got downvoted when i explained this shit happens all the time here. I was called a troll. Because this never happens here i was told. 
The irony. 
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:58:33
And then you cringe. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:42:36
Wtf? How am i a troll? Let me guess, i disagreed with you once. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:17:33
When you buy them online the drugs still went through drug cartels. All of the previous connections still exist. There is just one more middle man. The online seller. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:33:02
Amazing logic. Very similar issue. You convinced me.
