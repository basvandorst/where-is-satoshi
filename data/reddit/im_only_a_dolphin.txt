The idea is to have a man in the middle who accepts the bitcoins and pays wikimedia cash in order to indemnify wikimedia against any liability for holding bitcoins.  If wikimedia knows who the man is, they can still be liable.  If they do not know who the man is, there is no reason to trust the man will faithfully deliver the cash.

Keep in mind Tradehill was previously a victim of an ACH loophole in Dwolla which cost them $40-70k.  I can understand them being cautious if they think they're under attack.

Bitcoins *shouldn't* function differently, but Government and taxes are never that simple.  Bitcoins could be declared as a speculative investment or some "exotic financial instrument", which are restricted for non-profit organizations.  If this happened Wikimedia could face penalties and fines for holding them.

"There is no legal precedent for accepting bitcoin donation as a 501c tax-exempt non-profit organization, and our very limited resources need to be preserved for our primary mission rather than exploring and developing tax law.  So until another 501c tax-exempt non-profit establishes legal precedence, we won't accept it"

I can completely understand why they would want a single copy.  Once data is copied it is very difficult to control.  They're not a corporate IT department.  They need to scrub any trails to help protect sources.  And they need to keep their leaks closely guarded until verified and ready to publish.  Wikileaks would lose a lot of credibility if unverified leaks were released.  If a false leak was leaked while it was being verified,  I have no doubt the media would try to spin it as wikileaks publishing false leaks.
In the end, wikileaks is structured as a high-trust organization, and cannot protect itself from internal defectors at the level of Daniel Domscheit-Berg.  At least not while Assange is under house arrest.

Non-profits like the Wikimedia Foundation are under extreme financial scrutiny to ensure they are not exploiting their tax-exempt status.  It is much harder to declare bitcoin donations on your taxes, as it is not a currency recognized by the U.S. government.  Bitcoins may not be accepted as traditional donations by the IRS, or "not hold up in court."  There are well established practices for accepting euros.  While the health of the currency may be in questions, the legal validity is not.

They put that person at legal risk.  If it is someone known to the foundation there is the added risk of some sort of money laundering conspiracy charge.  If it is someone unknown, then there is no reason to trust they will faithfully deliver the donations.

Eventually, but for now I expect it to fall within the dollar range before somewhat stabilizing.  From there it is up to the devs to make it more usable and easier to avoid scams and fraud.
By far the biggest problem with bitcoin is the users.  People are willing trust mybitcoin and other incompetent/fraudulent wallets and exchanges with their money.
You can't expect the users to change, especially when the rest of the economy has things like FDIC to encourage trust in any certified financial institution.
It is up to developers in the bitcoin community to make better security for users so trust isn't as needed when using bitcoin financial services.  They also need to make it easier to do quick micro-transactions for small purchases.
Buy bitcoins as speculation doesn't do much to help.  Supporting the development efforts does.

Here's what I got out of it:
He quotes and summarizes the other article, saying: The Bitcoin community is quickly improving their security skills, to the point where they are protected from an FBI attack online.  However, the bitcoin community doesn't seem to do so well when it comes to fraud.  The other article suggests the FBI could set up a lot of fake exchanges and retailers.  Wait for them to get popular, and then follow myBitcoin's example.  Keep doing this until confidence is destroyed.
Then he criticizes that article.  
He is saying that one of the functions of government is to prevent this sort of fraud.  By engaging in the fraud rather than preventing it, the government would destroy their credibility as a business registrar.  This would drive the market to create a private industry around business registration and auditing.  And this is only possible with bitcoin since (when done right) everything can be anonymous and there is nobody for the FBI to target directly, and they must rely on fraud and not violence.
He sounds rather optimistic.

'Cracking a hash' means taking a hash and finding the plaintext value which produced it.
Mining is a 'proof-of-work' system.  You take a known plaintext value and add salt (some random value), such that the hash of the combined value fits some criteria.  You can then give out the plaintext+salt, and it is trivial to take the hash and compare it to the criteria.
For bitcoin, the known plaintext is the previous block header, some transaction data, and a fixed mining payoff to yourself.  You then add some random bits (your salt), and then create a hash.  The hash criteria with bitcoin is that the hash must start with a certain number of 0s, let's pretend it is 10.  If the hash of your plaintext+salt starts with "0000000000" then it is a valid hash.
You are adding a lot of random salts and hashing until you find a salt that gives you a good hash.
The required number of 0s for your hash is proportional to the total hashing power of the network.  So as more hashing power is added, the number of 0s increases so the probability of finding a good hash drops.  This way the number of bitcoins being mined stays the same regardless of hashing power added.
Once you add a valid block, it has the header of the previous block, so it becomes part of a block chain,  If two people generate blocks from the same previous block, then the chain splits and you have competing chains.  The rule with bitcoint is to prefer the longest chain.  Shorter chains are rejected by the network.  So if someone posts a valid block, its better for you to accept and verify that block, and try adding to it, rather than the previous block.
