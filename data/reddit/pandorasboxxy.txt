Drugs also represent a large degree of personal independence and bodily autonomy that most places don't even have. You let the government tell you what you can and can't put into your own body under the guise of "We know what's better for you than you do." and due to fear or some other nonsense, people eat that shit up. Not only that but they even threaten us with imprisonment if we disobey big papa govt. We are literally the governments/the ultra rich's bitch; yet everyone seems completely okay with it.

I hope this is sarcasm?

Lmao, negative ghost rider, your comments word placement and phrasing? All I needed to see; pseudointellectual, self-righteous, conceited twats like you are a dime a dozen.

I mean, I can understand where he's coming from to some degree. Imagine being persued by a majority of the world, hardly being able to leave your residence for fear of being caged for the rest of your life and probably tortured for whistle blowing and doing EVERYONE massive favors with nothing in return? I'd imagine it's gotta take a pretty large toll on the mind.
And his fears were obviously very valid because the first thing to happen was a court date being set for his extradition to the US. Why would you come here to poke fun at someone who needs the help of the people to fight against tyranny?

So why are you even here? To smear someone who has others best interests at heart? Wow edgy, big man. Surprised you didn't tip your fedora at me in the end.
