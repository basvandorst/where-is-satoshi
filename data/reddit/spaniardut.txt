I have been on Yobit for close to a full year now and have never had any problems with them. When Bitcoin Cash was announced they sent out the same exact email saying 1:1 BTC as well and the moment BCash was in play I had the exact amount as I did with BTC. so whatever BTC your holding on there exchange you will have the same amount of B2X in 18 hours I got the same email earlier today!
By the way this site in not a scam what so ever!

I found a way to figure it out, after you make a login and then go through the tutorial you can change the language in the settings, I did use an app translator tho just to get through making a login. so now it works on my phone just half of the language is Chinese still and of course all the other players names, but it works, I just dont know how to get the BCH now...

Sweet Thank you!

Well I mean there site is still up, so that's a good sign. You could be like me being super new to this Bitcoin thing, I stumbled on a site called bitcoinxl.org one of those sites that gives you a percentage an hour of how much you "invest" and I invested 0.5 BTC and was supposed to receive 1.5 in a month so when I finally got to that a month later. I went to withdraw my BTC and literally 3 days later the site was shut down and I never got anything back! I emailed there support and everything... still nothing. I lost 0.5 and that is why I'm so Skeptical of Mining sites now. But I want to know if Gemini is a legit site! I hope you get your Bitcoin soon!

I was told by many people that Gemini was a scam? is this not true? and if it is not, how does it really work? 
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:15:42
please elaborate on this? still learning...
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:02:15
Same here! It would be life changing for me as well!

and lets not forget the upcoming hard fork as well! I could see Bitcoin at an ATH of around $7,000 by mid January next year.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:14:09
That is truly a great letter!
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:49:19
It's actually a great little documentary
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:15:22
No problem!

I'm new as well but I've figured out to create a coinbase acct. sign up for GDAX which Coinbase runs. buy your coins in GDAX because there are no transaction fees, then get Mycelium and transfer all bitcoin to that wallet. and make sure you write down you back up key! hope this helps a little with buying and keeping them safe!

It's the after Labor Day Weekend sale!!! HODL and BUY!

Its going to keep dipping until 9/30 then be steady for about a week and a half, then start the rise again because it will repair it self, because us HODLers all know it will!

How does It work? and how do you use it the right way? and how much do you usually get from Gemini a month? if you don't mind me asking. Sorry for all the questions I'm still very new to all of this I've only been in since July been watching since June.

Mycelium and make sure you back up your HD Wallet with the back up keys. its very simple to use.

I think your friend's are very lucky to have you! trying to figure this stuff out alone 6 months ago was almost impossible for me.
