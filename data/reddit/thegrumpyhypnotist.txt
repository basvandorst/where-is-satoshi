Classic example of survivorship bias... comparing Bitcoin to Google and Facebook conveniently ignores the vast graveyard of hot ideas/tech/companies, like JustBalls.com --- Inc. Magazine's "ecommerce success story" from 1999. Yes, JustBalls.com: the internet's leading source of balls and ball-related accessories.


Well, JustBalls was well-positioned to capture a significant portion of the $2.5 BILLION ball-related market in the US... just imagine a billion+ Chinese people and all the balls they play with! The potential is enormous!!!
(Not intending to pick on JustBalls.com, and I'm actually hoping bitcoin succeeds, but come on... referencing Facebook or Google is like picking the 1 super-successful "hot tech stock" out of 9999 JustBalls.coms)

The reason they watch CNBC is to see what the suckers are being spoon-fed and getting excited about.

Just watched your segment with Fred Wilson, I thought you did a good job describing your experience so far... fair and balanced it was! I also liked how Wilson seemed like a steady level-headed fellow --- no flash. Exactly how I'd want someone who's running a thing like Coinbase. Looking fwd to more updates on the show.
