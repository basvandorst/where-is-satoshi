Stupid for people who care about money - sure. :)

So, what you are saying is that bitcoin has to either 1) take over the global market and be at least 80% of transactions or 2) grow in popularity and remain under 20% transaction due to hyperinflationary induced speculation ? (using pareto as an example it would be more complex of course)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:18:52
Faith. We've already seen big merchants (such as namecheap) accepting bitcoin payments, there is no reason it won't repeat again at a larger scale. :)

The best advice I can give you is : have a plan. If it works, good ; if it doesn't, adjust. Don't trade emotionnaly.

The filled part represent the movement from open to close. The small bar that can appear on top and bottom represent the total range of the price during the timeframe of the candle.
If you have a green M15 candle (going up) and completely filled, it means that the price didn't go higher than the closing price during the 15 minutes period. If there's a small line on top of it, it means the price has spiked higher but came back down afterwards and closed below the highest of the 15 minutes period.
If you change timeframes you'll see more details of the price (eg. change from M5 to M1). 
Also, bull or bullish means going up, bear or bearish means going down.
Hope that helps !

A currency does not encourage speculation, in the same way a knife doesn't encourage murder : it's a tool - for exchanging goods. And right now there's nothing to exchange. That's the real problem.

So greedy ;-)

The problem at the moment is too much speculation (against fiat value) and not enough usage (valuation against goods). It will go away with time and merchants adoption.

I feel you.

I didn't know this guy, he seems like he knows his stuff. Also he didn't say bitcoin is a fraud - just that he doesn't understand it fully and that people behind it seems passionate enough that it might take off.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:21:05
I'm happy for you, really.
I believe that bitcoin adoption will be found first in goods that have very high profit margin and where sellers do not care that much if they lose part of their profits - like digital products. They still have to believe in bitcoin to adopt it, and that's the toughest part, but we'll get there eventually.

How is it nonsense ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:25:59
Not if you bought ingredients for your loaves with bitcoins. The value would still be the same. You are talking about fiat to btc value, which is different.
I agree it's not stable yet, it doesn't mean it won't be in the future :)

When demand and supply levels meet (which could take a while), and given the transaction fee that will be mandatory for transactions to complete (because of competitivity), I don't see a problem with the deflationary nature of bitcoin.
Wide adoption is of course an issue, but I'm still holding on my coins to spend them when the day comes!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:38:21
I wouldn't mind if part of my profit was cut off to finance an alternative currency. And it's easier to cut off value from goods that are digital than, say, cars.
Doesn't it make sense ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:43:09
Or until it's widely adopted :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:08:18
A lot of people bought bitcoin - most of whom with their hard earned fiat. How is that different ?

H&amp;S is a trend-reversing pattern. I don't see a trend here (it wasn't really an uptrend) so I'm 50/50 on this one.
Candle patterns can be tricky oh tricky sometimes.

And that's exactly why we have a bursted bubble. Most people are rational and prefer to buy the car cheaper tomorrow, and that's a good thing because that's how we survived.
But right now we are experiencing a paradigm shift. And the price of the car will actually go up tomorrow, not down, because access to bitcoin is easier today than it will be when it's already mass-adopted.
Do you see what I mean ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:48:33
You are right, and I'm not expecting big companies to put their money behind bitcoin right now. That would be very sensational PR tho when you think about it.

Very good video
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:06:25
So you wouldn't even give it a chance ? I would, but maybe I'm a fool.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:03:14
Did you make this video ? If yes, the sound is very low can you reupload it after editing for more volume ? Thakns :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:09
And by real value you mean fiat value ?
