If you're facing "storms" like this, and expect to do so regularly, how can you call this scam a currency?

I agree mostly, but the reason people hold bitcoin is because they're speculating. If the usage for the currency is as small as you say, then the market cap should be way lower, but it isn't, the market's just speculative.

What? Microeconomic models cover bitcoin just fine. It works like most other bubbles, albeit with a surprising amount of stubborness by investors.

Government is going to get involved with bitcoin just as much as with other speculation tools, in fact it largely has. Governments don't feel the need to regulate bitcoin since it doesn't have the stability to amount to much. Blockchain definitely has a future since it speeds up the market, but the resulting volatility needs monetary regulation with a central bank similar to the world's currently widely accepted currencies. In which case, it'd be reasonable to expect fiat cryptocurriencies at pegged rates to USD or other hard currency, rather than bitcoin. Even thinking conspiratorally, people don't say the dollar is backed by the power of a government for nothing, and why would the government not use that power to demonstrate the validity of the trust the market has, which in this case would be removing a volatile, deflationary speculation tool from taking over the economy?

Pride is such a useful investment tool.

We didnt know how to time those just like we don't know how to time bitcoin. We have the same models for bitcoin, but those models have the same flaws. Textbooks are going to need to be revised, but not to cater to some unique bitcoin feature (it's just a normal speculation tool) but to reflect better economic knowledge about all similar instruments.

Other currencies have more secure systems and process transactions faster
Beyond that, trust has rarely been an issue in the digital markets. The only trust required is that in the value of the currency, which in bitcoin's case is very low, since there's no central bank to manage interests rate and reign in the market. Blockchain may have a future, bitcoin, however, certainly does not.
