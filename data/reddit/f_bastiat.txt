Congrats on your first buy and not being reckless!
Have you ever looked into union building trades? Honestly man, if you can read and write and have a decent driving record and no felonies, you could apply for an apprenticeship program and be making double what you are making now, doing HVAC or something similar.
I got out of IT and started HVAC when i was in my late 20s, i knew NOTHING about HVAC, the program was 5 years, was FREE, and they placed me in a job. It was the best decision i had ever made. Even here in FL where wages are pretty low for trades, a 1st year apprentice starts at around $13.50hr, and the minimum you can make after your 5 years is $25.00, some other states with stronger unions you can make $50-$60hr. Plus we get 2 pensions, our healthcare is covered (nothing off the check), i get a company vehicle, company smart phone, company tools, and pretty much make my own schedule.
Call your local union, ask when interviews are and what the pay scale is, and then ask yourself if what you are doing now will pay that much after 5 years. 
Good luck bud!

@_date: 2019-07-10 19:44:45
I look at the amount of extra money I have in my pocket, and the price of a coin, and if the price of a coin exceeds what is in my pocket then it is too expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:22:52
Because it was promotional it probably had a deadline to use. Idk if you can find the TOS but if you for example complain about service at a restaurant they may give you a $10 card that you have to use by a certain amount of time or it expires, otherwise they have to have cash on hand to compensate for all these cards being out there and no way of knowing when they will be used. This works differently than a gift card which has federally mandated rules. It sucks but it makes sense.
Here is a link on how giftcards work which may or may not apply to this situation since BTC is not USD but i just found some of the info interesting.

Ok, thats what i figured, my only issue that i figured would bite me is that i have held for over a year but ive traded hundreds of thousands over the past few weeks and essentially cycled out the coins i have held for over a year for new coin so i think id be paying on the short term gains now which kinda sucks but at the same time i'm having a hell of a time getting this much money out, im already annually capped for wire transfers at my exchange so it may end up long term by the time i get it all out anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:56:29

I dont understand how each taxable profit and loss would even matter, if you put in $100USD, make 50 trades, cash out everything for $1000USD, wouldnt you be paying 15-25% capital gains on $900USD regardless of how many trades you made up or down?

I lost about 12 BTC in the first crash and was very discouraged so i moved my coin to Bitcoin QT which i believe is now Core, it was the best decision i ever made, because i was going to sell around $1000 but i hadn't synced my wallet in forever, by the time it was synced it crashed again and i said fuck it till it got to where it was when i sold. Had i had it in an exchange or had my wallet synced, id have sold a long time ago.

How do you feel about the lack of removable storage? I often work in places that have no cell service and idk if you are familiar with Plex but i just sync media locally on my devices for when im in those situations. That being said, i can not fathom why they still wont put an microSD slot, i get removing the headphone jack, once i switched to bluetooth i cant imagine ever going back to wired, but they are killing me with the storage.
Also since you seem to know a bit about iphone maybe you can explain a work around for this, i love how my android names my pictures with the date the picture was taken in the name, but iphone starts over the naming system when i take my pics off (i think), or upgrade to a new iphone, or my backup folder has both mine and my wifes iphones pics. Its made for utter chaos in our backup folders because several pictures have the same name, and i have noticed just copying and pasting whole folders of pics from iphone to a windows computer is not seamless, it leaves pictures out for some reason, and i tested this by using multiple win 10 devices and across both our iphones which are different versions. Any thoughts?

Ouch, shoulda held. I remember buying in at $43, watching it go to $265, than freaking out and selling when it crashed back down to $60.

That's my prediction, I am in no way an expert and there's no one on this planet  that can tell you what will happen. The 3 previous bubbles were at $31ish, then 266ish, then 1242ish, if the pattern continues this bubble will pop at 12000-12500ish, it will crash 60-70%, and take a few years to rally to the next bubble. If it crashes when I predict it will, then it's a logical assumption that will be 120000-125000. Again, just my prediction.

Thats kinda where we are at, im in a high demand trade so i dont worry too much about losing my job, its more if something were to happen to me. I have long/short term disability and an overkill life insurance policy, but an injury could cause me to not be able to go back into my trade once i heal up. I think I'll just wait a bit longer, im still mentally ok with losing it all since it cost me less than 1000 but im approaching that threshold where it would bother me if i lost it.
I also need to figure out how to deal with that fork that happened a while back, its probably easy peasy bit my last sync was a week or two before the fork and i just have wallet backups on half a dozen jump drives and my BTC only laptop (running Bitcoin-QT). Not really sure what will happen if i sync up, will i be stuck on one chain or the other? Can i download both chains and restore my wallets in each chain? These are the questions i havent taken the time to figure out so i dont fuck up my coins.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:15:07
I feel ya on the crazy ups and downs, i lost like 15 BTC thinking i was a day trader and i absolutely am not, and Bitcoin is so different than stocks because of the 24/7 cycle and big events that happen within the community.

They do training modules you can sign up for, I got an invite for one that was a 101 for Bitcoin and blockchain specifically. Unfortunately my company will not pay for me to participate because it's not relevant to my trade. I was still excited to see it.

I had about 500USD worth of different coins from several years ago, a little bummed about this but i havent traded in there since like 2014. I saw the site is completely down now, i wonder what will happen to non fiat. I think i had like peercoin, litecoin, namecoin, and maybe .2 BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:34:40
I looked through it I just need to sit down and relearn a lot of this, I was really into Bitcoin like 5 years ago I'm just trying to get back into the swing of things, so much has changed.

@_date: 2017-07-31 20:54:42
My core wallet is backed up and stored in a safe place, it was last synced a few days ago but the HDD failed so I have to reload the blockchain and import the wallet which there is no way I can do that before tomorrow. When things settle down do I sync one chain or the other and import within that chain?

-Don't leave your money in exchanges. I pulled out of GOX a week before they went down, and fortunately i only had about .2 in BTCe.
-BACKUP YOUR WALLET MORE THAN ONCE. I lost a jump drive with a backup, fortunately i had 2 others stashed around my house.
-Never panic sell, I lost 13 BTC panic selling during the crash when we hit 250.
-Never invest money you cant lose into BTC. I have seen numerous stories of people losing life savings to the point that the suicide hotlines was constatly being posted in this sub.

If you have a backup of a wallet and the wallet is no longer supported by the developer you may be fucked if you can't get the last release of the wallet to run. Armory for example ran fine on my laptop 2 years ago, now I have to run it on my desktop (runs fine) because it locks up whenever I do stuff on the laptop because of the added demand over the last 2 years.

The trick is the representatives are the government. I don't need representation like I don't need taxation. I spent all these years yelling and screaming and getting arrested at protests which in turn probably made the state bigger. Come to find out and all I had to do was invest in bitcoins to contribute to the fall of government. This is a protest for me and I wouldn't have any representive of the government lay their hands on it. Respectfully, imho.

i love it, i got all my currencies out of MtGox right before it went down for maintenance and sent it here, been messing around on this ever since.

Words of advice. Don't ever contact the police, they are not there for your protection and will waste your time and money far exceeding $80. Bait him into another meeting and say, "you took my bitcoin, now I'm going to take your life." Thrn follow through with your promise. Chances are you'll go to jail forever but you will do so with your integrity. Or you could just cut your loss and learn from your mistakes.

It's a legit check that they tell you to cash and than keep whatever percent and wire the difference back. If your bank is dumb enough to let you cash it, it will bounce a few days later and you have to foot the bill.

Its easy enough to have it auto update when you connect to the blockchain and if it were say, 5 years, it would mean you havent touched your money in 5 years and probably lost your wallet. Seems like a relatively easy solution for such a big concern with people.

I think because Reagan was very "anti-government" in his speeches and quotes. He did a lot of deregulation which cant be said for anyone after him, but he also started the war on drugs which, i cant say it turned out how he planned but than again he never should have started it in the first place.

As much as i prefer simple and clean, this is a pretty weak site man, i could have made this when i was 10 and that was in like 1995 using notepad. You need pics up without clicking an imgur link, at least half a dozen or maybe a gif. If the videos are genuine originals i get not having a lot of content but thats REALLY a small amount of content. Considering anyone who uses BTC is probably tech savvy you arent going to get many people willing to pay for something free. I can torrent entire site rips of the most expensive sites in a matter of minutes. In any case i appreciate the fact that you are investing time into BTC you just need to jazz that site up for real. Maybe have a request board??? Hire a girl to fulfill requests for btc and you split 50/50. Idk, its hard to market porn these days. Good luck though.

Not a dumb question. It is difficult but if you're using tor, your data can be intercepted. Also if you manage to get a trojan or other virus, it can render Tor useless and you wouldn't even know it. Also if your facebook account shows you log in from your address sometimes, and than Iceland others, its obvious you palalab are using Tor so you must be up to something and worth looking closer at.

Sorry friend i dont think you know what anarchy means or the foundation of crypto currencies. Please look at the side of this subreddit for links to learn about what anarchy actually is and not what the government has lead you to believe it means. I will take your rude response as you just being blinded by what government has taught you and hope you can come back with an apology later. Check out r/anarcho_capitalism specifically for some good info.

without seeing the person in front of you, probably not going to work. Once you send money you have no way to track them down. Maybe google someone doing paypal exchanges idk. That a tough one, just get verified and be done with it. Earlier you start the better off you are!

I was trying to write a guide for people who dont have a lot of computer working knowledge. I personally use Ubuntu. Even if all their stuff is backdoored and logged, if they follow the guide exactly they still wont be compromised due to the backtrack layer. I may add a reformat to Ubuntu to the next guide i put together and as others suggested as well, some basic encryption would be a good topic. Thanks for the feedback.

I once spent nearly $1300 on several Shure SM57 and SM58 mics from a seller and they turned out to be nearly perfect knockoffs from China. 5 minute phone call to paypal and my money was back in my account. The lady said do what you want with them you don't have to send them back. I was happy how it turned out but i can see how someone could take advantage of that system pretty easily.

satoshi dice and circles are a win win on their end, theres no product being exchanged and im sure incredibly low overhead, worst case scenario they cash out and move onto something else. SR has been going through issues since bitcoins hit about 50 but black markets will always find away even if bitcoin were to disappear tomorrow. Not a lot of other options and i feel like some of the companies jumping on board were probably just trying to make a quick buck too though some probably wanted to adopt it for the reasons it was intended.

Explaining what bitcoins are to a local representative is like explaining bolt cutters to someone who put a chain around your throat. This is an important step in the world developing beyond the (perceived) need for government. They are paid through coercive taxation and bitcoins contribute nothing to that, only reduce the pool of stolen loot. It will never be embraced by criminals of the state. EVER.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:07:06
If you are planning suicide please leave your backed up BTC wallet for your family so they can use it later when the market stabilizes and they can laugh about what a fucking idiot you are while theyre by the pool in their BTC mansion.

It doesn't prevent it, it just masks your location. Even if a spy logged into your computer via a trojan and saw that you are at address 123 main street, when they get there, they wont find you because that's just where the router is located. They would now need to search 1 mile in every direction for you, that's a lot of time and a lot of manpower. Hopefully by then you would know whats up and destroy your laptop if they decided to pursue it.
I wouldn't call it hijacking, its more so piggybacking because they still have complete control of their router and can reset and change the security at will. I also wouldn't expect anyone to do it unless in a situation where its warranted, but that's up to your own conscience. The guide is for educational purposes only.
You can never fully prevent what i outlined above but there are plenty of security measures i didnt include that can improve your anonymity.
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:08:59
Think about this realistically. Most people work 40 hours a week and dont want to spend the few free hours they have trying to change something that they didnt want in the first place, having to learn "the system" to do so, and the people youre going up against also work 40 hours a week within that system with the sole purpose of keeping it going. Forgetting all that, you obviously didnt visit his link to AnCap, we never agreed to these laws in the first place and need 0 of them.

Good point on textual analysis, i'll have to work that in there. If you drill through the platters of the HDD its going to sling metal all through the housing, I cant imagine it being salvageable but i have never had to do it and a drill is more of a household item than an electromagnet. I'll also add something about SSD's and look more into physical destruction.

Create a truecrypt volume, put a fake wallet file in it, create a hidden truecrypt volume in your initial volume with your actual wallet. If you want to next level the encryption use all 3 types at once. (AES(Serpent(Twofish))) using the Whirlpool algorithm. I would go as far to say it is impossible to decrypt or even know its there.
