Nah, I think it’ll all blow over.  It’s a nothing-burger and people are overreacting because everyone’s on edge with the FUD bullshit being spread over the last few weeks

This has already been discussed at length by the bitcoin community.  It’s coming but we know about it.  it’s no surprise to anyone.

Looking at the LN project from the dev side of things (check their GitHub), it looks like they still have quite a lot of issues to work out before it’s even remotely ready for integration.  And each change will need lots of testing, followed by full scale QA testing after they freeze features for a potential release candidate.  On top of that, after all that’s finally done, the exchanges and wallet software teams will need to develop support for it which could take several weeks to several months, depending on how fast they work.   I’d be amazed if we see LN even remotely close to being even partially integrated into the bitcoin ecosystem by the time 2019 rolls around.  Like many projects, bitcoin is a great idea that was unprepared to scale.  We’ll need faster solutions than the LN to get bitcoin out of trouble.

So sorry to hear about all this.  I had to go give my cat a hug after reading this story :( at the very least, I’m glad to hear you were able to recover your btc

Tom petty free fallin’ is playing in my head rn.  But seriously I think it’ll bounce back.  We were under 10k a month ago and btc has always been a roller coaster
