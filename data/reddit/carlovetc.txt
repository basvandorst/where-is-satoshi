Understood, but I'm also asking for your opinion on a disclaimer or change in wording? Is that an acceptable stop gap for the concerns you have brought up? If not, why not? If their description of the product is simply incorrect, wouldn't a more accurate description satisfy the concerns you have raised? If not, why not?

No signal. Pretty much just needs somone to develop a user friendly ux/ui and then ppl start using it. If a co like fb runs a lightning channel then we would have a "global venmo" with 2b users overnight.

Far left is about using force and violence change the world, that doesn't sound like you. It sounds like you have been tricked (like many) into believing that someone like Hitler is "far right" when really he is the epitome of big government control and violence. Non aggression priciple is one of the most consistent things our society can aspire to imo.

Voluntary is the key word with anarchism. Collectivists forcing you to do something with the threat of force is not anarchism. For example, "you are doing something we don't like so you need to leave or else we will kill you or throw you in a cage" this is the literal opposite of anarchy.

Without some sort of suggestion it is essentially just a complaint. Based on everything you have written thus far, I would say you have more to contribute than that, no?

@_date: 2018-01-18 12:37:44
No it's inefficiencies in the market due to centralized power which grants certain people the ability to green light or deny other peoples freedom/rights. The answer isn't beating the shit out of people/throwing in a cage those who take advantage of this inefficiency, the answer is not letting people take away the rights of others. People should be free from regulation to transact voluntarily.
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:48:47
Anarchist collectivism is an oxymoron. Far left is complete centralized control of anything and everything, regulations to infinity.

Please describe an extreme far left government? How does it operate? Are there rules? If so, what are they?
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:53:54
So there are ZERO taxes, zero regulations, you don't need to take care of anyone else outside the specific business, is that correct?
Also, people getting together and voluntarily giving some people more money for some work and less money for other work sounds a whole lot like capitalism. What exactly is forceful about my fishing net factory that pays managers more than the janitor?

Really well, it helps with price discovery and the legitimacy it adds to bitcoin has high net worth funds from around the world taking necessary steps to invest since we are up over 1000% since this time last year and ~70,000% since early 2013. Again, it still kinda sounds like you don't know how futures work and you do not know the long term benefits, try reading about it again.

I didn't say that they are bad countries. I am saying thst they are by farrrrr more free market than they are centrally planned market. I would not and do not consider them extreme left in the slightest. I am asking you one simple question, to please define what an extreme far left government would hypothetically look like, is it really that hard?
You are delusional, don't even bother answering, it's just going to be more nonsense and you avoiding a simple hypothetical thought experiment but then again thought experiments require thought so I guess just forget it.

I'm not talking about bitcoin I'm talking about government, like with people. How can there be rules in a Society without rulers, please explain that to me. Also the reason why bitcoin is a representation of anarcho capitalism is thst it is completely "opt in/voluntary/non aggression". The same way that a basketball game is "anarcho", because it is a voluntaryyyyy game.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:33:31
If you weren't employed do you think the universe would magically give you water/food/shelter? All of those things require an immense amount of work! Generally the reason people work is to amass a much higher standard of water/shelter/food by working a job voluntarily than trying to fetch/hunt/gather/build on their own. Let's say someone even worked a job for 5 bucks an hour cash for 10 hours in 1 day, thats 50 bucks. That can buy dozens and dozens of eggs, oats, milk and water. How much would the same person need to work if they were fetching/hunting/gathering/building? They would need to work for 80 hours probably and still be starving, they would never even get to the building part. The simple fact is that by voluntarily working a job you are buying into a lot of the automation that has occurred over the last 2000 years, you benefiting from all the advances humans have made thus far. This idea that work doesn't need to be done and resources just fall from the sky is completely nonsensical, it's a lie at best and genocidal taken to the extreme.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:09:44

Ok so the extreme left is a centrally planned dictatorship, are we saying that ZERO central planning/zero rules/anarchy is in the center!?  Where is it if it's not on the left and not in the center? What is the opposite of a centrally planned dictatorship. Now I'm not saying that an anarchist society is a great thing, it would be a mess imo, but it certainly is the farrrr extreme right on the spectrum, no? I am only bringing up all of this to call into question the idea that Hitler was anything but an authoritarian central planning violent wacko. You like Denmark?

Completely voluntary is the definition of no rules. For the record, I am not saying thst anarchism is the best system or thst it's functional, I am just saying that a collective that makes rules to be "followed" is not anarchism, it cannot possibly be anarchism. Rules that must be followed are the opposite of anarchism.

That's true. I completely forgot that people didn't used to pay a yearly fee to have a checking/savings account with a bank. I also forgot that debit cards don't actually charge 2 or 3% per transaction to the vendor, along with a yearly fee usually and chargebacks, I also forgot that those fees aren't passed along to the customer. Another thing I forgot was that a user of a debit card doesn't lose a few percent to inflation every year, so if they had 10,000 in a debit card account they wouldn't lose $200 per year on inflation alone. Now that I remember all these things it sounds like a $20 fee to join the lightning network and make unlimited p2p instantaneous transactions for years is not going to happen. I also forgot thst i opened a lightning channel and it didn't cost $20, it actually was way more expensive for $3.

Oooook so how would you rewrite the wording then. Criticism without a suggested course of action or a solution is rather illogical, no? For example:
* Alice creates a soapbox car to the best of her ability. Bob walks by and comments that her design sucks because it creates too much drag at points X, Y and Z. Alice asks Bob what he thinks should be done to alleviate the drag in those spots without slowing down the car due to other tradeoffs. Bob comments that he has no suggestion. In this scenario it's actually possible that Alice has created the perfect soapbox car (among the 2 of them)since Bob cannot improve upon it. Thus making his comments completely pointless and illogical for all intents and purposes.
So, what do you think they should write? Would you change it? Would you have a disclaimer? Do you have any suggestions at all for what can be done to remedy the situation thst you have brought up? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:52:11

You are right. I forgot that if someone closed their debit card account or their checking account then they could still be paid, obviously superior to lightning in every way, I never thought about that. I wish I could send payments to an address that doesn't exist the way that I can send money to a checking account that doesn't exist anymore. Also, once the mesh network is millions of people with infinite routing possibilities, I forgot the real possibility that 99% of the channels could suddenly be off the network and would stop my transaction from being routed to the address I'm trying to pay. I always hate it when the entire internet globally completely goes down, don't you hate that?

"that's right, but the idea is that people would want to take care of each other, even if they weren't forced to. crazy i know."

Let's say we were on an island with 4 people.
* 1 person gets water. Alice 
* 1 person gets food. Bob
* 1 person builds shelter. Charlie 
* 1 person makes a fire. Daniel 
Now let's imagine that Alice under consumes (saves) her resources for a whole month so that the next 3 months she can work on a special project that creates water all on its own. This increase in efficiency means that she no longer has to get water, there is now a surplus of water that everyone trades with her in exchange for their stuff. She also is now an extra laborer so the island now has more food since her 2nd best talent is gathering food. 
* please explain how a major efficiency boost provided by technology does not result in wealth creation?
The whole point of technology and automation is to increase efficiency in markets which then provides more water/food/shelter which then raises the standard of living for everyone which is literally the definition of wealth creation.
* what on earth are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:29:27
Right. All three nodes. Also, now you are talking about nodes closing, not someone closing their payment channel. When it first started the whole thing would cease to function if 1 node went down. In 1 week it will be even less likely that 3 nodes dropping could take out the network.

You can read all about payment channels and the lightning network on your own. To be more descriptive about the process in the future, I imagine opening a payment channel will be like adding friends on venmo, Facebook or any other social network. The users won't even know they are using bitcoin or that what they are doing is opening "payment channels". That is the actual future.

Crypto currency removes the use of force from many markets and can bring the world back to true some sense of true free trade/capitalism/volunteerism. This free trade will bring about more efficiency and pull even more people out of poverty globally. Additionally, it will help destroy the money printing schemes that governments around the world have been doing and slowly erode funding from the global military industrial complex.

1. It would then be the defacto dark net market currency, dnm is a trillion dollar market cap sector.
2. It would still be used as currency in countries where they have very poorly managed currencies. As they experience growth from the efficiency buffs that crypto provides they would then become economic power houses very quickly. This would attract new investors, new citizens and new capital, all of these people would then become users of bitcoin as well.
3. lrn2 prisoners dillemmma. All it takes is one nation domino to fall and not regulate bitcoin like Nazis/socialists.

Yes now that i think about it you are correct, all of the fields are exactly equal, all of the participants in those fields have the exact same problem solving abilities.

I now understsnd that the large data sets that comprise these groups are exactly equal and it is a very nuanced position that I am not smart enough to deeply understand but I will take your word for it.

Ok so you are not saying that they are equal, and you are not saying that stem students have better problem solving abilities on average? Are you implying that liberal arts students have better problem solving abilities on average?
There can only be 3 possible outcomes for the 2 data sets.
* A. Students majoring in STEM fields, have shown that on average they are better problem solvers than students majoring in liberal arts.
* B. Students majoring in liberal arts fields, have shown that on average they are better problem solvers than students majoring in STEM fields.
* C. Across all known data sets and studies it has been shown that both sets of students are 100% exactly equal.

How does this have anything to do with "iamverysmart"!? It really shouldn't be a shocker that people who specifically major in stem are generally smarter than people who specifically major in liberal arts, there are endless studies on this btw. Even the anecdotal evidence you brought up are stem majors with liberal arts as an afterthought (at least thats how it sounded). Again for the record, I did not go to college and I am definitely the average dummy or probably worse. However, it doesn't take a degree or that much intelligence to guess that on average there would be smarter people in a group of 100,000 stem majors vs 100,000 liberal arts majors.

1. It's not a headache at all, it takes 2 seconds to set up.
2. It seems like you have never lived in a bad neighborhood before, this is a common practice. Many people carry a smaller amount of cash on them and then their actual wallet so that if they get mugged they can throw the cash on the ground and run away or hand the smaller amount of cash to the crook and be done with it. Most muggers just want to get some money and run away, they don't want a scene.
3. The bitcoin you carry on you is not your entire account. You can have a $200 on your phone and keep large amount stored on keys that are not even connected to the internet.
4. Cryptocurrency is still very new, everyone that is getting in now is an "early adopter". When bitcoin or another crypto is a world reserve currency then it will not be a way to make money at all. It will be so widely used that it will be more stable than the dollar is today. For example, if the marketcap of bitcoin were $100 trillion it would fluctuate by less than .1% on any given day, it would be solid as a rock. So no, anyone that gets into it when it is already HUGE will not "get rich". That's the thing about being an early adopter, if you recognize a trend before others do, you are typically rewarded for it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:57:45
1. Shops are accepting it more and more, as this continues to happen it will be worth more and more.
2. The difference between a ponzi and a vaid model is that a valid model has an actual use case with actual growth opportunity. Like the difference between Bob making fishing nets (that catch no fish) out of paper mache and Alice making excellent fishing nets (they catch a lot of fish). No matter how much Bob shills his product there is no value being created, his nets are Zero Sum, the nets Alice makes are a benefit to society in that they are a tool which creates surplus value. Bitcoin is more useful every passing day, it is a "fishing net" that is constantly being improved and tweaked for maximum effectiveness. In time, you will see how effective the network can be.
3. There are very obvious ways for your family to get your bitcoin after death. It shouldnt be too hard for you to imagine this. If you really wanted to be safe you could give 1/3 of your private key/s to your family, 1/3rd to the entity handling your will and put the other 3rd in a safety deposit box that is to be opened upon your death.
3. What you are describing is called the "5 dollar wrench attack" and bitcoin has a better solution to this than cash actually. First of all you should not keep a large amount of bitcoin in a personal mobile wallet. 2nd, it is possible to set up a distress account with a small amount of funds and an actual wallet with your real funds. So if anyone came to rob you, they can watch you put your distress pin and you give them 50 bucks rather than your wallet holding "500" or whatever amount is in there.

* Are you assuming that everyone will be "equal" when automation has become more efficient?
* There have already been automation advancements and humans find other ways to express themselves, other work to be done, other things to create and other items to sell. It's human nature.
* Do you think no one will trade at that point?
* Do you realize there will still be people with more than others?

* There will still be some people with more artistic ability than others.
Your premise that EVERYONE literally EVERYONE will be EXATLY EQUAL is not only impossible, but it would be an absolute nightmare and you domt even realize it. The force/violence required to bring about  this pipedream utopia, that people like you seem to envision, is what resulted in over 150 million deaths during the 20th century. Please take some time to critically think about what the human race would really look like if everything. Every. Single. Thing. Was 100% equal. I promise you really havent thought this through, because it is a logic blunder of disasterous proportions, and deadly consequences.

"A bitcoin user!"
* Correct. ONE bitcoin user, stop trying to speak for others, especially about matters you obviously know nothing about. 
"You can be blind to the facts all you want but I️ see them for what they are. A RIGGED GAMBLING JOINT for the rich and lazy!"
* You should take some time to study the first futures contracts that existed and learn why and how they allocate capital/resources to areas of the economy that wouldn't typically have received the capital/resources.
"See, a lot of you guys are just in bitcoin to get rich quick, but not I️."
* There is so much cringe, I don't even know where to start. You are either new or very dense.
"Bitcoin’s name shouldn’t be used for scams and rich punks pushing a false agenda for their own benefit."
* Bitcoin isn't a company or a trademark or a dumb little club just for you. 
"Now these rich regulated punks want to mix the fraud in? Not going to happen! I️ definitely would not waste my time with them."
* How exactly does this affect the bitcoin protocol, please explain that to me. 
"I️ definitely would not waste my time with them."

You are misunderstanding how the consumer-facing applications running on the bitcoin network are actually operating. There are services that allow users to send "fiat" between country A and country B, for low fees+convenience. The services are actually just using the bitcoin network to make the transaction possible, the user doesn't even know they are using bitcoin, all they know is that the service is convenient with low fees. They are not aware that in the background when they send "1000 fiat" with "CompanyX", that CompanyX is using the bitcoin network to make the transfer possible.

There isn't much more to tell. There are some in the group that are nonviolent and just caught up in the nonsense, but I'm speaking specifically about the violent members. There exists a group of violent skinheads/Nazi people put there as well (not the people antifa calls Nazis which is everyone, but actual nazis) they are violent in an offensive manner just like antifa. Two sides of the same coin for sure. I'd say the only difference I see in the two groups and this is typically how I refer to them during discussions:

It isn't about taking credit or news articles, and who are you to say what a "real bitcoin user" IS, lmao!? Maybe you haven't been here long or maybe you just don't get the point, but bitcoin at its core is about voluntary action and responsibility (among other things).

"How would I️ stop them? I️ can stop them if I️ wanted to. I️ won’t get too much into that."
* You are arrogant, delusional and full of resent. Three personality traits that lead to nothing but trouble, I pray for you.
"I️ can stop them if I️ wanted to. I️ won’t get too much into that."
* You sound like a violent authoritarian or at least someone who supports that kind of thing. Bitcoin is very much NAP so I don't know where your ideas of "stopping" voluntary contracts fit into the picture. Even if you have "ideas" for stopping these people that are not direct force, there is still some sort of force or foul play in order to stop person A from making an agreement with person B. You have some serious issues at the core of your philosophy, although it seems you don't realize it.
"I️ won’t get too much into that."
* Would your method involve force/violence/threat of violence from you or others or not? Think about it. If there is no force/violence/threat of violence from you or others, how can you possibly stop 2 people from making a voluntary agreement? You are rotten to the core with resentful ideology and you don't even realize it.

It's is both.

I do understand your comment, what you fail to understand is that your analogy is poor and based on a fallacy.
You point out that if apple stock stopped trading then they would still have assets, true. These assets you speak of would have value if they could be, what's the word, **traded**. You go on to state not that bitcoin units stop trading, like your apple stock example, but that the entire bitcoin network just vanishes from existence. Convenient that your apple example just stopped trading but you managed to make hundreds of thousands of ledger copies disappear, convenient false equivalency.
If none of the apple assets could be traded at all, as in not utilized even as paperweights or homeless shelters, then their value would be zero just like with bitcoin. You assumed 100% complete destruction of the bitcoin network in your analogy but only assigned apple a stock that cannot trade, of course the values would be out of wack. Try again with a proper analogy.

Holders are not irrelevant, but assuming someone does not participate in the community in any way aside from holding say 1 LTC, of course they are going to have less involvement in the network direction. You're vote is your money which is your right to disagree with the particular direction that a chain is moving and "vote with your feet" accordingly. A "dictatorcoin" would be a chain that threatens other competing cryptocurrencies with the use of force which hinders competition which results in subpar development for the users, users lose in this scenario. The current paradigm is that anyone who disagrees with the direction of a chain is free to sell at will and put their money into a chain that is moving in a direction they believe in. This is a completely voluntary process at the moment and as long as it continues to be voluntary, development will continue to push forward in positive directions. If there are no chains that are developing in the direction you believe is "best" then you have the following 2 scenarios:
1. No one is moving in that direction because it's not something the market wants and the experts in the field have determined that it is a waste of resources to develop in a direction that the market will not favor.
2. The experts in the field are wrong and have not accurately determined what the market wants. There is an opening for someone to come in and meet the demands of the market, in doing so they will be rewarded with massive growth and a very popular project.

You still haven't given me an example of non physical violence. It's sounds like you are doing a lot of mental gymnastics to justify your use/support of violence against nonviolent people. If there is violence against nonviolent people then those people can also engage in offensive violence and from there you have feedback loop of violence which eventually decays into chaos. Has it ever occurred to you that the false narrative "it is moral to offensively attack and control others in the name of X" is what has lead to the large central governments thst exist around the world today, the large arms buildups that exist around the world, and the large scale extermination that just occurred within the last 100 years. Here you are telling me it's ok to beat someone up because someone sold shares of their own stock, has it occurred to you that it is that very train of thought which infects so many other aspects of society and leads to ruin. Consider this:
* What if force was only permitted to protect oneself or others from harm (waste dumping included).
* what if people started working to not get so offended by everything but instead worked towards  getting offended less and less by things.
* another question, let's say I invented a machine that was hyper efficient and created water, food and shelter for everyone globally.

"Jacking up prices"
* Ok cool, so you don't know how market pricing works. You can't just jack up prices, as long as there are no restrictions on competition or innovation, then your competitor is right next to you underbidding at all times. That's literally how markets work and find such efficient pricing for things even as complicated as advanced technological products. You have no idea what you are talking about.
"Discharging waste into the water."
* This causes direct violent harm to many many people and the punishment should reflect that. How is that indirect lmao!? Would you also try and claim that poisoning someone is indirect? How can you even compare people willingly selling shares of their  stock/bitcoin to a company dumping poison in water that people drink from?

Do you think traders care about the intrinstic value of bitcoin? 
* No. Traders trade based on perceived future value or lack there of, what's your point? A bunch of traders that are more informed than the public about an upcoming shortage of an item may speculate on the price which makes it trade higher because the wisdom of the trading crowd dictates that it is undervalued, that's the literal definition of trading.
I'm trading myself, I follow trends and indicators. I long when I see fit and I short when I see fit. 
* Good for you. Probably a larp but great job if not, fantastic work.
Nobody serious is holding bitcoin for the long term.

My god, it's like pulling teeth. Ok so let's be conservative and say you think it is 50.1% chance of being lower in 5 years? How does that sound? Do you think that is on the conservative guess or still too high?

My name is Carlo, nice to meet you, and yes I agree that I am still pretty average since there are so many amazing people in the blockchain community. I've never met anyone like you that is so afraid to make such a simple guesstimate, especially after the obvious bold claims that you clearly made.

The only big players are using bitcoin for trading or arbitrage, i thought that was obvious what I meant - nobody is holding bitcoin as an investment. 
* Your statement is false, I know this with 100% certainty. Lrn2 network.
Many big names have in fact publicly denounced bitcoin.
* Lol ok, many big names have come out supporting it, what's your point?
Since I think it's overvalued I believe that the most likely scenario is that it will go down regardless of time horizon. Obviously the longer the time horizon the lower chance that the bubble is still sustaining itself.
* I knew you would avoid the question and that's why I was so specific. So tell me, here comes the question 
"In 5 years exactly, what chance from 0 to 100% are you sure that bitcoin will be lower than it is today. You don't even need to tell me how much lower, just tell me from 0 to 100% how sure you are that it will be lower than $4,150." 
Are you able to answer that?

If your "club" has rules you are not an anarchist.
Lets say I was selling stock in my next invention business to 10 people in the village, any 10 people. I needed to work for 10 months on my next invention and I needed 10 months of salted fish to complete the invention but I told everyone it is a realllll long shot at success, only .01% chance probably. In return they would own 90% of the income of the machine split between them, 10% for me. They invest and I complete the machine successfully. This machine is able to provide clean water to 7,000,000,000 people every year and each of us split the profit from people that pay us in salted fish. Now everyone on the team is a billionaire and the rights to the business are passed down peacefully to their kids and the whole world peacefully agrees with the agreement. Do you take issue with this?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:35:15
Way to avoid a simple question, nice job, I'm sure you are very successful. 
If you have no idea and cannot even make a simple guess than why make this statement below?
* "Since I think it's overvalued I believe that the most likely scenario is that it will go down regardless of time horizon. Obviously the longer the time horizon the lower chance that the bubble is still sustaining itself."
Please explain what you meant by that statement. Are you taking it back? Is 5 years too short? Are you not sure that "the most likely scenario is that it will go down regardless of time horizon". What on earth are you trying to convey? Is it so hard to say that there is between a 50% and 90% chance that it will be lower in 5 years? How thick can you be?
In case you were not aware your statement mathematically translates to "You believe that there is between a 50% and 100% chance that it will go down regardless of time horizon." You are already picking percentages buddy, how about narrowing the time down a bit or is that too complicated for you as well?

China can ban it all they want, it won't make a bit of difference as to the long-term of the platform. They will just be putting themselves at a major competitive disadvantage on the global market when competing against other countries that have harnessed btc.
Another part you missed "odds". 
A risk taken that has a 1% chance of being successful and a 10,000 to 1 payoff if successfully is mathematically a better bet than something that is 99% chance of success and 1.0000000001 to 1 odds. 
Yes, bitcoin is swingy and people should be encouraged to make their bets according to their risk tolerance since it is a very volatile market.

Rewarding people who join early is literally the exact model that every single major company that has ever been started in the history of everything. Do you realize this? Think about it, why would Bill Gates or Steve Jobs start a company and say to themselves "wow this is going to be huge in 30 years, let me take only .001% for myself so that it's fair for everyone later!". That would make no sense, and because it makes no sense it never happens that way. People who were early and took the risk were rewarded handsomely for the HIGH RISK that they took. People that are buying in now will be rewarded more than someone who jumps in 10 years from now. What objection do you have to such an obvious mathematical truth?

Nooooo, as indicated I asked for your 5 year guess since you are such a hotshot trader. Based on your quote above, is it safe to assume that you think there is at least a 50% chance that Bitcoin is lower in 5 years than it is today? Do you think it is more like 50% chance, 60% chance, 70% chance, 80% chance, 90% chance? Is is that hard to make an educated guess? I have plenty of people in my network that trade traditional markets and they never have any problem making these types of general guesses, especially if they make a bold claim such as the one you made.

If you have not heard this term before or are unaware what is means in the context of this discussion then I suggest you look it up. Betting smaller amounts relative to your total pool only ensures that you approach a number closer to your expected value in the long term, it doesn't actually change the odds of the bet.

Your error is in how you are thinking about conservative/risk/reward. If his conservative estimate is for bitcoin to be minimum 500% up in 5 years but an estimated chance of total loss in 5 years at 90%, then the expected value of the investment is actually -EV and a poor investment. However if you are expecting something to have a 99% chance of failure in 5 years but would be estimated 1000x returns, then you are getting great odds even though there is very little chance of success. Maybe it was a conservative estimate because the high risk of bitcoin makes a 500% return in 5 years only a few% edge when accounting for the total loss percentage.

You missed the part where people avoid unproductive ventures because they are better off just working and getting paid in money that doesn't melt. You also missed the part where bitcoin is at the point that farmers take loans in bitcoin, the market cap would be in the trillions and because of its larger size the upward moves would be nearly flat. You also missed the part where the farmer would be getting paid in bitcoin at that point so he would not be "paying half back" and oweing more than the original loan. Either think in terms of btc or dont. I could just as easily come up with doomsday scenarios if I brought up a farmer who was taking loans here in Iowa in dollar but he was getting paid in Venezuelan Bolivars, that would make no sense though, just like your scenario.

Try that math again. Also, if you are so sure about your reply stating it "would generate a conservative estimate of zero", then I have a proposition for you. Let's meet somewhere and I will bring a number wheel that is numbered 0 to 100. I will bet $1 each time on the number 7 and every time I lose you will take my dollar and every time I win you will give me $1000. How does that sound? Are you interested? If no, why not? If the stakes are too low I would be happy to raise them.
Granted there is an assumption of 1% being a certainty in the scenario and the assumption of 1000x returns, but the point still stands. My original point is that 500% return in 5 years can be a conservative number if the investment is speculative enough to be considered only a few% edge when calculating/estimating the risk of loss.

You have no idea what you are talking about. Bitcoin is an open protocol for anyone to use however they want. Coinbase isn't a problem, what would be a problem is the government using violence/force compelling people to use coinbase or "goldmansachs base", as long as there us competition then fine.

* Replace "crypto" with "internet". This is what was said about the internet.
* Take your post.
* Replace "crypto" with "electricity". This is what was said about electricity.
* Take your post.
* Replace "crypto" with pretty much any technological innovation ever. This is what was said about those technologies too.

* "Violence takes more forms than the physical."
* "curtailing the bad works of others."
Do you even realize how nuts you sound? All of your rhetoric is just excuses to be an authoritarian maniac or support people who are. What makes you a good person for violently attacking people that have not acted violently? If you can state clearly why violence is ok and why that makes a society better please do so. What I object to is this moral superiority you think you have in supporting violence against people thst are non violent. Just come out and say it like it is "they are assholes for manipulating the market and it makes me very angry, so I support violence against them as revenge for the people that were tricked by them. I cannot control my rage which makes me a shitty person but the manipulators are shitty people too so they deserve to be attacked.
Furthermore PLEASEEEE tell me about violence that takes more than the physical? And don't try and come up with something like being threatened with a knife, that is an obvious physical intimidation tactic and is considered violent and threatening already. Please tell me what scenarios involve violence and or violent threats thst are not PHYSICAL in nature?

The market will produce competitors as it always does, everything you linked to is nonsense. There is plenty of competition for Intel out there, again you have no idea what you're talking about and no amount of rage or enthusiastic links are going to prove that Intel has 'no competition' when in fact they have tons of competition. Are they 'ethical' I mean no probably/definitely not but that doesnt mean they are able to shut down competition globally and they never will.

I see the difference. We all know the difference. It just doesn't matter. The base layer is not affected by custodial services built on top of it, that's literally the whole point.
@_date: 2018-07-03 20:36:03
We see superior protocols and technologies fail to get adopted all the time because they fail at marketing or market positioning or business partnerships.
* in reference to open source protocols, please name an example of this. I think this is where you/I have a fundamental disagreement as to how open source software evolves or develops.
Users just aren't that engaged with the technical facts and they shouldn't have to be, they are far more easily swayed by advertising than they are a technical crib sheet.
* developers will tend to build better 2nd and 3rd layer products on the best base layer. Users will not even know they are using the bitcoin network the same way they dont know what tcp/ip is. Developers chose to build on top of tcp/ip even though there were "superior" competing protocols at the time for the same reason that devs will continue to build on top of bitcoin, bitcoin is currently the best base layer without question, regardless of marketing/price.

You have no idea what you are talking about. You are just spewing nonsense shit about economies of scale and large scale manufacturing operations that you clearly dont have the faintest idea of. Please read the side bar and learn how free markets and competition actually function.

It depends on how the 3rd quarter earnings go which will determine how many developers they can hire for the windows factory. Try going to the bitcoin website and calling the toll free number, customer service lines are usually shortest on tuesdays.

There are a million places to find the exact kind of discussion you are looking for, but instead of looking you just write whiney posts complaining about everything.

I actually agree with you Now that the feds have shut down these darknet markets there is no way that these drugs will make it into the hands of people that shouldn't have them. We should also make all guns illegal that way criminals will definitely not be able to get them. I think a real discussion should be had about some of the other harmful things that exist here in the country, that way we can make them illegal and they will not exist anymore.

Let me get this straight, you want to see the end of capitalism, correct?
1. You do realize that when Bill makes 10 arrow's (he's really good at it) and trades it to Tom for salted meats that Tom hunted (he's really good at it) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;^^^^ That scenario is capitalism!
Are you actually advocating that no one trades anything ever again!? 
2. If you want to end capitalism, what interests you in bitcoin!? It may very well be the most anarcho-capitalist thing that has ever existed in the modern world.

If any company were to truly attain a "monopoly" without the use of force it just means that they are doing something extremely well and extremely efficiently, in such a way that all the employees, customers and general public are satisfied. It means that their quality would be such a ridiculous standard that no competitor has the opportunity to beat them or compete with them when they are operating at such high efficiency.
