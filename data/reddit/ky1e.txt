A large increase in demand for energy to use for bitcoin mining should spur more supply of either cheaper energy for mining bitcoin, or more energy-efficient hardware for mining bitcoin...or both. With the amount of capital flowing into cryptocurrency, and the energy constraint being so real, surely a large portion of the market cap. will go to R&amp;D into both of those things (energy &amp; computing efficiency...).

Mining hasn't been a profitable (individual) investment for around a year, at least from my own investigation. There's obviously different circumstances people have with power costs and whatnot. To get 1 BTC per day on your own, you'd need (as someone else mentioned) 38TH. That's pretty damn hard to pull off now.

Going with your thinking, if they started keeping BTC as well, then it'd be a gamble. BTC has had huge crashes already. 
It they don't keep BTC and do what TD is doing now, changing to fiat upon being paid, then you are right. there is no gamble. I was wrong about that in my above comment. But then again, there's no incentive either.

You did not mention the arrest at all in your explanation for why the arrest is good news.
Also, comparing Bitcoin to a stock is a bit harmful if you want it to be taken seriously as a currency.

I know a great deal about how bitcoin works, I'm confident in explaining it to others and I truly appreciate how revolutionary the technology is. I just don't like the Bitcoin community. I actively cheer against it. I've seen too many smug bloggers, arrogant "investors," and grandiose prophets.

So you won't be discouraging or addressing short-sellers? I think there could be consequences for the bitcoin community if you allow people to use your subreddit strictly for short-selling, or, betting on Bitcoin's price going down. Loans for legitimate reasons is a good thing, but predatory investment styles like that could hurt the community,
Maybe you should require some proof of what the loan is for. Also, you might limit the amount of requests one account can make over a certain period.

It seems like a much higher gamble for a supplier to start taking BTC. Face it, retailers like Overstock and TD primarily started using BTC as a publicity stunt. They got huge first day sales through BTC. Some supplier of t-shirts, for instance, wouldn't get as much media coverage if they switched to BTC. And, since TD has already made the switch, nobody will have been waiting to buy those shirts with BTC.

The value you are talking about applies to every single cryptocurrency, right? Each of them have the same "intrinsic value."

I'm also paid five times as much, so I don't see your point. Also, if we're talking about the value of currency changing over time, if bitcoin can half its price in a day, then it isn't really secure.

Those are good points, and I agree that there's less immediate danger to customers with bitcoin. But the tricky thing with "hacking" is that it comes in many forms and you can't expect what will happen. Bitcoins have already been stolen before, and exchanges have already had problems with their infrastructure.

To translate this graph into Bitcoin terms, the uphill part should be much smaller and the downhill part should be much larger. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:35:41
The price is going up due to a rumor that Gox is closing for good. The community has been building that exchange up as a scapegoat, and now that they have leaked documents saying it is bankrupt, they think all of the problems are gone.
Once Gox makes an actual statement, the price will go down again. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 03:54:28
Yes, but the dollar doesn't commonly half its value in the course of a day.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:09:44
It's not new, you are the 200th person to post it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:49:24
The uncertainty over Gox is now at its highest point, it's not "going." They still have made no official response. Plus, saying that they have been keeping the price back is only speculation. You can't pinpoint anything with commodities. 
And with such a large exchange acting like this, who's to say that no other exchange is going to go the same way? 
As for the transaction malleability thing, the patch for it is a long way off, in my understanding.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:01:46
Privacy? You're still giving them your name and address for shipping. And your two other pros only appeal to early BTC adopters and tax-evaders.

There was also a wallet id listed in the post. The guy was asking for donations for pizza or something. That's against rules, for good reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 22:40:12
Not 100% seriously, but still. Bitcoin can be stolen in many ways, and the current forms of currency can be stored securely in many ways. Saying that Bitcoin is a paradigm shift and will change the world because it can't be stolen is a bit silly.

Each bill has an ID number, so there's at least a minimal amount you can do with that. With all big digital USD transactions between banks, there's a hefty amount of information that the IRS gets along with it. 
I know he made other points, but the tracking is his main point. He admits that there are legal uses for Bitcoin here:


I mean, how can you say Bitcoin isn't attractive to money launderers or drug dealers? From a senator's perspective, I can definitely see the urgency in curbing Bitcoin's possible involvement with this stuff.

Also, the worst thing you can do regarding automoderating is publicly say what your rules are. That way, spammers can see what they need to do to bypass it.

It doesn't really matter what the price of 1 bitcoin is if you can spend any fraction you want, like 0.000132. I think the realistic top price is $1000. It's entering the real public eye at around that price, and that will be the accepted price point for new adopters. Then, if it still exists after a year or so, the waters will settle and it won't be so volatile.
Plus, $1000 is a nice number.

OP has clearly not seen this chart, showing that as BTC's price has plummeted from December's fever rally, USD trade volume has ALSO plummeted...
in a regular equities market, or like gold, you usually see volume go UP when prices drop like that....but those markets aren't so 1-sided as Bitcoin. 
Analysis by "chainalysis" shows that since December, a select few (keyword: "Select," as in, friends of exchanges, developers, hackers, or all 3) have spent the past 7 months ringing new "speculators" dry...


@_date: 2018-06-14 16:02:39
You're saying...unironically...that it is "impossible" to manipulate the price of Bitcoin for profit?? Not even if you are, say, an EXCHANGE who holds hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Bitcoin...not possible?

yeah, Roger Ver is so much richer than that other guy; he won!
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:42:19
Ver is so...disingenuous. 
It is disingenuous to say that, since Bitcoin's "Market share" is declining, its viability and popularity is also declining...
It is disingenuous to say that "No newcomers to Bitcoin will think that by downloading the Bitcoin.com wallet app, they will actually be creating a Bitcoin wallet"...
It is disingenuous to say that abbreviating a name like "Bitcoin Cash" to "BCash," which many would do as a matter of habit, is somehow an orchestrated social media attack...
and it is disingenuous to say that the original Bitcoin whitepaper only left room for one interpretation of the single viable coin, which is what Ver seems to believe. He repeatedly says, "Bitcoin Cash is the only coin that meets the description laid out in Satoshi's whitepaper," which is obviously a subjective opinion open to endless debate...and obviously, someone could make improvements on Bitcoin Cash and create an even more accurate coin to the description in the whitepaper...
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:01:26
You say this while the price of bitcoin on Bitfinex, the exchange responsible for ~14% of all volume in last 24 hours, is about 10% LOWER than other exchanges (like GDAX)...if all those Tether issued in last few days went to Bitfinex, it could have accounted for ~10%-15% of volume on that exchange, and could have definitely been related to the massive price fluxuations if it were used maliciously. The total volume you have been quoting is, again, meaningless, as nobody knows how that Tether is being used.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:05
can't be related to the newly minted 24,999,000 Tether tokens, right??
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:17:32
Roger Ver does
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:46
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:32
"volume" is meaningless. It's transactions on only a handful of exchanges that leads the price, and these Tether issuances have correlated with each dip and recovery: 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:14
Saying that the $24,99,000 Tether just printed only amounts to "0.2% of the BTC volume over the past 24 hours" IS meaningless, especially if you provide no link to where you even got the stat. I guess I'll just copy and past my last response, then:
"volume" is meaningless. It's transactions on only a handful of exchanges that leads the price, and these Tether issuances have correlated with each dip and recovery:
I think it is perfectly reasonable to assume that this recent spree of printing more Tethers is related to the price ballooning to $11k and then shrinking back down to ~$9k.

there's no claim that anybody holding the btc blockchain is currently liable; the point of the paper, as explained in the abstract, is to demonstrate the existence of "single instances" of illicit content stored on the blockchain, and to discuss broadly how 100+ countries may approach the issue of illicit content on a public blockchain separately...and they explain how they were able to find the content.

what a ridiculous way to rationalize Bitcoin being used to distribute child porn. The "FUD," which was [released by a team of researchers,]( describes the blockchain being purposefully used to distribute this material. Not to "randomly generate" it, you numbnuts

Or let's read the researchers' paper and discuss the recommendations that they make...
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:32:02
I am familiar with the table of elements...that is a finite list, though; the number of possible cryptocurrencies is infinite. There are only ever gonna be like 24 million Bitcoins...a lot of them remain in Satoshi's tomb, a fair amount have been lost (some in landfills...), and the mining incentive for BTC literally runs out in just a few decades...so I personally think that "Bitcoin" will be superseded by some other cryptocurrency, perhaps one that already exists, and has a higher throughput and more longevity than BTC, which itself superseded other cryptocurrencies...

@_date: 2018-03-23 01:49:20
here you go dude; found what you're asking for.
the other stuff about writing code to generate CP images from any data is still immaterial, because this paper concerns actual use of the Bitcoin protocol, by criminals, to store and distribute child porn.

Watching the heavy BitCoin investors is scary for me. These people believe that just because they want BitCoin's value to go up and up it will. They will never listen to reason or give in to moderation, and any attempt at having a discussion with them is instantly turned into a shouting match. 
I hate schadenfreude and never really partake in it, but I kind of want to see BitCoin fall to pennies again and just see how these hard believers act.
