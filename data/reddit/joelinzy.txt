John from Bitwage here. Our aimed exchange rate is in the top right corner and the spread is calculated with an algorithm. The rate has lately have been higher than US exchange rates daily high, but in the past it has been lower. We're aiming to get it lower as new developments happen. As far as the requested fee schedule, we do intend to add flat fees after we exit Beta. These will be justified by new features.

John from Bitwage here. for 1. the account and routing numbers we have for customers are from US banks only right now. If your employer/payroll provider is sending from a canadian bank they have to send an international transfer to our US bank.
2. if the payment is coming directly from the employer's bank you can just say the payroll provider is the bank's name if you know it (and give bank's website) or as much detail as you know.
