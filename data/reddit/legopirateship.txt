Because a deflationary economy is the inverse of an inflationary. 
Also, because we still in a capitalist world, meaning that companies need to increase their profits more and more each year, and not high value industries, like cleaning ladies, bakeries and the food industry in general, they'll have to cut the wages. 
In a purely Bitcoin controlled deflationary world, everything's price should decrease, including people.

Software development is a high value industry and developers have more power, since there are not enough good developers, but look at coal miners and other manual labor industries, like Amazon warehouse workers.

Wages go up too. In a deflationary economy, wages for less valuable industries should go down each year, for the same work you'd get 2% less money, but of course the prices should go down 2% too, while productivity should go up, so there is actual profit for the company. 
I don't think people will accept, that their salary will become less and less each year. Even if their purchasing power would stay the same. 
Normal people would just see: My money is less =&gt; not good =&gt; I'm angry now

Seems the keyboard on my phone went crazy and put commas everywhere �� 
Thanks for the heads-up.

Because now they can get away with just not increasing it, but if we live in a deflationary world, then they won't have a choice, and unless people make strong unions, companies can just do whatever they want. 
People will have to face the reality, that their work worth less and less and of they want to increase their wealth, then they should change to high value industries, but sadly I don't think common people are capable enough to do that...

That's not the point, if they keep up or not. People don't care about calculating if their purchasing power decreases slowly overtime. They only notice like 5 years later. 
But if their salary at the end of the year, just suddenly decreases 2 percent, while they worked hard, then even the people, who believe the earth is flat and vaccines make you autistic will notice that. You can try to explain deflationary economy to them, but I don't think you'll have too much success.

People will only understand that at the end of the year, for the same work, instead of 100$ they get 98$, they cannot understand the concept of purchasing power, just like how people cannot understand now, in an inflationary world... Sadly common people not that smart, and I think this is one of the biggest obstacles in front of bitcoin... dumb people...

BitWallet? Doesn't even asks for email, you can generate as many addresses as you want.

That's my problem too, I have no problem, buying after it lost 20-30% value, I have a problem after it risen 20-30%, then comes the uncertainty of if it's still going up or will it come back, and how much will it go up. 
After a 90% drop it's safe to assume that at some point it'll go back to its peak value at 20k, if the tech is solid and you believe in the project, 
But at 13k it's not even sure if you could even double your investment.

You cannot run out of 10%-s.

You buy and don't sell. ������

I bought bitcoin after the crash around 4000, 6000, 7500, and now it's 12000. Isn't that buying the dip? 
I think it's a good and simple idea to buy when something is low, and wait until it gets high enough.

Just invest as much money as you'd be comfortable with throwing out of the window. 
Think of the money you invested like money you lost instantly. 
After you doubled or tripled your investment it's good for the heart to remove your initial investment. Then you can just forget about it. 
Also, the maximum amount of money you can lose is the amount you invested. You cannot lose your house and stuff like that, unless you gamble with your life and mortgage... Which is not good. 
I invested like 350 dollar now I'm at 1100 and I don't really care too much about the whole thing at all. I have my normal well paying job, if I lose everything, my life won't change at all.

Because of the block size. Since all nodes have to store all of the block chain, the 8 MB blocksize will make the block chain so big, that only big data centers can store it.
