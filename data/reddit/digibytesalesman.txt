lol amen. When BTC shot up from 3k to 15k nobody in my family said peep to me. When BTC consolidated from 15k to 10k... everybody blows up my phone with texts to inform me ... pure fools. My uncles thought they were so smart, now they are poorer than me (and Im only 25!)

That is only 4/5 True OemMufflerBearings.... Taking a profit is bad when the profit could be double if you waited 14 days. Like when Bitcoin shot form 8k to 16k... major regrets cashing out .1 BTC ... if I waited basically 14 days coulda doubled... So bad time to take a profit??

Exactly. Rich Dad vs Poor Dad mentality. Poor dads want us to get a job and be wage slaves. Rich dads invest in Bitcoin so the child doesnt have to work/labour etc. 
Its so shameful being young/wealthy and coming from a poor family.

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you. BTC accelerates so fast, its too risky to attempt a drop-trade. Hoping to swap out a 19k BTC for a 14k BTC, many people have attempted that back in the 3k-8k era and got burned when it cracked 10k, they couldnt catch up with the market and lost their BTC. they lost track of the market and got caught with pants down. HODL the original BTC and you cant lose
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:00
Gamblers fallacy is how you win BIG at roulette. I'm the  Roulette Player in North America (and I dont play French board) and I win by long "gambler's fallacy". The only people who call it that are non-gamblers. If a binary event happens on average 1/2 times, it's best you correlate your bets based on previous past events (history). His-story is how you choose friends, choose partners, history is data and data creates informed choices. Msg me if you want to learn how to win at roulette
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:12:00

Yes 1 BTC is a share in a 21 Million share company called Bitcoin CEO satoshi nakamoto. Think of it that way
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:23:21
RIP FINNEY
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:19:09
That is not going to happen because there are only 21 million* Bitcoins versus hundreds of millions of overpriced homes/properties etc....
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:43
self-fulfilling prophecy. thats all this is.... the Bitcoin was brought down today by people's poverty and pessimism. We dont live in a world of infinite brilliant optimists, most people are depressed so today the BTC is depressed

That is the best line Ive heard all year. That has been my mantra since this summer and I take BTC as a serious corporate investment strategy.

Bitcoin is 70% or more centralized in China presently. Miners are highly selfish and not that altruistic anymore due to high energy costs, if Bitcoin Cash becomes more profitable to mine, bye-bye BTC fork

Here the roulette dealer says "NO MORE BETS!" and waves her hand so you cant do that late bet maneuver (but I know what you mean). If a binary scenario has a 1/2 chance of happening, and it does not appear on the 1st turn, it actually has a slightly higher chance of occurring - this is Cosmic Odds - no event is independent. All the events are interconnected. No event is independent. If you have a big enough bank roll, you can beat roulette using historical data... as I said only non-gambler "mathematicians" preach gambler's fallacy.

This issue has to do with the amount of "inputs" within a BTC transaction. The more inputs noted, the more bytes your tx occupies within the 1 MB block.

The amazing news about this is that for the first time we have a country in dire straits that has 1:1 PARITY WITH THE SATOSHI. Each bitcoin can be split into a quad?rillion smaller units called satoshis. 1 Satoshi will be $1 USD by 2020. 
1 Satoshi will cost $100 by 2025 or 2050 depending on if they increase the blocksize from 1 MB to 1 GIGABYTE for pure global bitcoin hegemony. We cannot allow market share to slip away. 200 Bitcoin ATM's are on the way to Argentina.
