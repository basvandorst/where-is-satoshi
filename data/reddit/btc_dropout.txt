Its in the ToS, which you agreed to when making an account. You accepeted an agreement that said they do not support your state, and what will happen if you send money from such state. It is 100% your fault. They are completley upfront about it, they have to be legally.

I had a very similar problem I was trying to tackle. I needed to generate the child public keys of X amount of numbers from the master parent public key. Not sure if that's exactly what you're looking to do, but if so, try this out:
    from pycoin.key.BIP32Node import BIP32Node
    xpub = 'YOUR_MASTER_XPUB_HERE'
    xpub_key = BIP32Node.from_text(xpub)
    for x in range(10000):
        print xpub_key
        print xpub_key.subkey_for_path(str(x)).address()
Enter in your xpub key, and change the range to the number of addresses (currently 10,000 in demo). Child public keys will be derived from that number, so if you do 1,000,000 as the range, it will give you the first the addresses from the master parent public key from the variables being the numbers of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc. to one million. 
If this works for you, please forward the tip to He walks me through all of this, plus has some more code related to it in [this thread](
Requires pytools.

This is what we classify as public service announcements now?

WCNForever, or World Crypto Network, which ProTip has a streamed on many times and has connection to? Your entire post history is bashing ChangeTip for ProTip. You're giving ProTip a horrible name.
Ok.

Im sure a $12M VC funded company has nothing better to do but selectivley scam and blacklist IP's from accessing their website for $170.
*rolls eyes*

Really good or really bad. That's Bitcoin!

Have fun in life with that mentality. Yup, you're right, it's not your fault you didn't read the ToS before agreeing to it.

Lol, it's clearly a glitch on your side if the website isn't loading.
"MY INTERNET EXPLORER WON'T LOAD YOUR PAGE SCAM SCAM SCAM MY MONEYS GONE"
I have yet to understand, they did not steal your Bitcoins....they're still in your account....jesus christ. 
EDIT: I read your pasts posts. No shit they're going to lock your account if you open one and fund it from a state they CLEARLY say that they do not support. Now they need to go through a regulatory process to release that money back to you. Sorry, but its your fault. They are just following the law. Read the ToS before you send money to somebody next time.

Did you have an account on bitcointalk.org ever?

As if that's their place to control what a free human being does with their money.

That's for nemonics...?

750 BTC sent.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:04:52
Awesome, thank you!
Any idea why it tells me xpub_wallet is undefined?
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:47:47
They're not random numbers, it's a number set of 0 to 6000 appx with about half of the numbers missing. I have control of 3000 wallets with a number range of 0 - 6000 pretty much. 
Anyways, I totally got what I needed. I hacked at this most recent code and got it to do exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much for you help man, I sent you a tip to your address. You're a great person!

This is awesome, do you have any way to set a custom diversion path?
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:08:24
Ah, maybe I didn't explain to well. It not the numbers 0 - 3,000 - its a list of 3000 numbers, not in any order. Do you know any short hand for putting these in?
Ex. 2412, 2351, 2616, 2718, etc. and so on until about 3000 numbers. 
Is there a school that teaches this and assigns BTC tx address creation for homework? If so, sign me up! (Check my username, not homework :P) ......maybe I need to go back, lol. 
Edit: Sent you a present as well :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:09:52
Thanks. I have another question if you don't mind :)
So I'm trying to run a specific path, which is m/0/(x) - where x is a unique number I have, and I have about 3000 of them. They are not in numerical order. 
How could I alter this code, to set the path to (m/0/(x)), and have X equal ~3,000 numbers not in any order? 
PM me your BTC address if you care to continue helping. Seriously, you've been awesome.
