Bitcoin goes up on it's own strength, has nothing to do with shutdown of US Government.

India loves Bitcoin

Bitcoin is only a road. We need service stations to add functionality and make it more usefull.

Hundreds of thousands of new users join blockchain every day. Its hard to believe we continue to plunge after bitcoin lost 2/3rd from the top but that's more likely than going back up.

When you start to doubt if you should buy then many others are probably doing the same and start to re-enter the market.

The whole internet is still in innovator stage, only about 25 years old network, hanging on a wire.

Bitcoin got big because it was good, free to use and people all over the world started to support it by themselves instead of through marketing campaigns or investments.

30% up should be possible, after that probably more government trolling to be expected.

How can he watch the game with Bitcoin on his glasses?

Think of how many people that are not a millionair want to have one bitcoin, I think those numbers are more impressive.

Bitcoin is pretty much undestructable since it's used all over the world. Regulators can create rules and laws but the blockchain will be there forever.

Banks should be greatfull that Bitcoin creator gave them blockchain technology. Not embracing it is kind of a cherrypicking culture that does not contribute towards its developments.

Banks want Bitcoin but due to regulations they can not. That's why they make their own blockchains, even intermediary banktransfer blockchains. EU wants to become the leader in blockchain technology.
