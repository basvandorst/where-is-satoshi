And sell your friend some onecoin tell him he is stupid for doing it and when it screws him over never let him live it down. It's what a good friend would do.

while you can send bitcoins really quickly there are still relatively few places to spend the bitcoins. its also a pain in the butt to change fiat into bitcoin and back.
so a week to turn cash into bitcoin, a little while to transfer the bitcoin, then a week on the other end changing the bitcoin back into cash, if your bank does not close your account.
I know small amounts you can do the local exchange thing but some towns don't have a guy ready to buy your bitcoins and very few towns have enough guys ready to buy to cover transferring large amounts.

I was hoping some one would have more incite on the topic.
I think if the economy crashes due to default bitcoin would do very well
but another option is nothing happens in which case nothing will happen for bitcoin
the final option is america if forced to balance its budget, if that happens bitcoin will take a hit. the balancing of the budget would show a stability in the US government and dollar that would make bitcoin look bad in comparison 
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:08:56
as of September usb miners are down to $35 each on amazon. with even a small hand full running you should break even before the difficulty outpaces you. and if you throw some serious money at it you might even make a small profit before the next new thing comes out and every one ditches asicminers. when I first saw bitcoin you could mine with your CPU and there where faucets that gave whole coins away. I thought "that's neat no reason to install a wallet though." then came the GPU's and the free coins went away.

like the title says if he is doing some thing illegal like stealing money and transferring it to a bitcoin account then sending those funds to other bitcoins accounts in exchange for coins the "double your money" would make sense.
like stealing money from paypal accounts paypal can see all the money went to a bitcoin account, so maybe this guy drains those accounts into his customers accounts.
I am jsut asking if any one else has used it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:04:29
yeah then they check the block and find the address it went to and take it back. you would have to send it to a ton of addresses, scater the money to the wind.

I heard about it in late 2010, I remember thinking "its like regular money only not backed by a government, I wonder if it will take off"
then I forgot about it for a year found it again and though "wow its still going, if I had money I would start mining"
forgot about it again until the big bubble earlier this year and though "fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck I COULD HAVE BEEN RICH DAMNIT DAMN IT DAMN IT"
then asic miners came out and I waited until the price for those dropped and ordered a few. I could order two more with my mining profits right now. but I am making more money from deflation than I would get from the extra miners.

If I had invested say $100 in 2010 knowing me I would have held onto all of it until it doubled and I had $200 then I would have sold $100 of it to maintain my initial investment amount. then the money that was in there is "free" and I would have kept selling $100 at a time every time it doubled. once services showed up to buy and sell items via bitcoins I would have started gifting myself things on the investment. the market highs and lows do not matter my profits do. say its rising and I can sell $100 worth a couple of times on the rise. that is better than trying to time the perfect moment to sell and make more money.
right now I have not broke even mining yet. once that happens I will think about selling or buying things with the bitcoins but as it stands I am just helping keep track of every one elses transactions for fun. I do not have a serious amount of money yet.
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:09:09

you could play any currency exchange as a stock, trading american dollars for yen and then into pounds and then pesos and back into dollars timing the trades to make a profit in one of the currencies. that does not make them less of a currency. I am making more purchases with bitcoin every month. from christmas gifts to movie tickets. 
playing the exchange to make a profit in dollars or pounds is like the native americans trading land with the white man for more and more beads. it is the land that will have more value later.

more bitcoin is always better.
