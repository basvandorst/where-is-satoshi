There isn't any easy of native way of doing it through Mint which is disappointing. Maybe we could get them to add blockchain.info support like they did with coinbase (blockchain has the ability to add watch-only addresses). Or we could try to get coinbase to add watch-only addresses, though that might still take some changes on mint's end as well.

You tell everyone, "stop riding Bus 1 and the bus driver won't have a job anymore, Bus 2 is better and goes along the same route!", but alas, people still ride Bus 1. 
You try to forget about Bus 1 since you made the switch to Bus 2, but one day, Bus 1 has broken down yet again and blocked every lane, causing a huge traffic jam. You and all the other buses are stuck in this jam now. Yup, even long after you stopped riding that horrible Bus 1, it is still is affecting your commute.

I send my landlord a check with the id 001 and "Rent" written in the Memo. The mailman takes my check and crosses out the memo and writes "Mailman Rules!" instead. I check with my bank to see if a check with id 001 AND memo "Rent" has been cashed, they tell me they don't have a record that matches those two criteria.
The simple solution is to instead only ask if the check with id 001 has been cashed, because you know that tricky mailman might have changed your memo to prank you.

There is a lot of demand for exchanges in less popular currencies. Once every country in the world has an exchange to convert BTC to their local currency, then Bitcoin will really start to succeed.

I think they should use a variable fee that increases as they get closer to 50%. 0% miner fee at 20%, 1% at 30%, 2% at 40%, etc. Pool operators will receive more profit if people flock to them while also discouraging their service with fees. It's not a long term solution but it would be a responsible thing to do while also providing some benefit to the pool operators (more profits for them).

I feel like the author doesn't really understand social media. ChangeTip is inventing a whole new type of economy. ChangeTip will empower content creators, charities, etc, not only through easy of use, but through the power of social media.
These days, people are taking to the internet, creating content for free, and earning money in ways no one ever imagined. 20 Years ago did we think random teens would be making millions of dollars off YouTube videos? Did we think people would be streaming video games full time to support themselves? Did we think people would be recording podcasts that would become cultural phenomenon? And all these things are provided for free, usually supported by ads, sponsors, or donations. 
I think ChangeTip will enable this kind of new emerging economy in ways that probably none of us can even imagine.
Just look at At first I thought, the idea was dumb. Then they started generating some sizeable progress. I though, wow this is a cool idea actually, and only possible because of this new social internet. At the same time, I also saw how drastically Paypal failed them. 
I feel the author is too focused on how things are now and not open enough to how the internet is evolving and what new things Bitcoin will enable. 
The whole point of ChangeTip is that it's social. If you don't like that or are concerned with privacy then just use Bitcoin instead.

When a transaction is made on the bitcoin network, a miner will see it and if the fee is above a certain amount (that they decide), they will include the transaction (and any others it finds) in their blocks, which then confirms those transactions. 
So basically, you are paying the miners to confirm your transaction.
This fee can be changed to whatever you want (though some wallet software wont let you). However, keep in mind, that if it is too low miners might not include it in their block, which means your transaction could sit for a very long time without ever being confirmed (possibly even forever). Generally, using the suggested fee by the wallet is your safest bet.
 
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:12:41
You must be under the assumption that running a secure, highly efficient exchange that also complies with international law is cheap. Fees will go down when the market becomes more competitive, right now the exchange market is not very mature.
As laws become more clear, you will see more exchanges pop up and fees will decrease. (Assuming the laws aren't worse than when things were unknown) If you want to see some changes, we should be pushing harder for governments to officially clarify their stances on bitcoin.
Right now, its not worth the risk for no profit. There are many potential legal issues with running exchanges.
@_date: 2012-09-20 00:27:28
Using Bitpay would be using traditional currency though. You can put the price in a traditional currency (USD for example) and have the user pay the bitcoin equivalent of that price, and Valve will receive USD in their account.
The only reason I think online retailers don't accept bitcoin is because services like Bitpay are still very new. They don't have a reputation yet (even bitcoin doesn't have much of a reputation yet), so it isn't worth taking the risk. Services like BitPay need to build to build up users and reputation before larger companies think about taking the risk. That and the legality of Bitcoin is still in the grey area (Until there is some kind of clear decision large companies won't take the risk).

I like to think of it as a "meta-currency". Its good for businesses because they anyone can buy bitcoin with their currencies (hypothetically at least) and everyone can accept bitcoin. Its extremely useful as a translational step or layer of abstraction for global and digital purchases/transfers. It is definitely similar to a commodity, but I think it can be more easily translated into fiat/local currencies faster due to the digital nature and lack of regulations.
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:31:04
IMO it doesn't need to be. If you ask me, Bitcoin is actually the least useful for mainstream 1st world consumers. Bitcoin is most useful for moving large amounts of money enough and giving it's users full control of that money. Things like remittances, currency exchanging, and stock ownership(colored coins), storing savings, and online transactions or micro payments are places where Bitcoin is most useful and often more efficient than the legacy banking system. For buying a cup of coffee, credit cards and cash are already sufficiently efficient and secure.
Also, many of us on here are in 1st world countries, we have credit cards, bank accounts, and it is relatively easy for us to store and spend money. In many countries though, access to credit cards and banks are limited. For many people, Bitcoin can do those things more efficiently and more securely than the available options in their country. Also, I can then accept a random purchase from someone in a third world country, and not have to worry about exchange rates, or whether or not their method of payment is trustworthy or not.
TL:DR; In an increasingly connected world, Bitcoin is more useful as an efficient and secure "glue" between the variety of global monetary systems, than for every day purchases.

It's understandable that people are disappointed with the pricing, but if they were actually profitable for miners, more people would buy them immediately, difficulty would increase, and they would soon be just as unprofitable. 
People will always be disappointed with miners, because your hardware is constantly going to become less profitable and obsolete. Sure you can preorder from some other company for a price that seems profitable, however when you actually get your miner a year later, it probably works out about the same way anyways.
That's why miners are becoming more of a novelty than an investment.

Most likely, after you initially get Bitcoins (say by trading USD for them), if they increase in value and then you trade them back into USD, you have made a capital gain and will have to pay capital gains taxes on it. The gain is only realized when you trade back into USD however, if you stay in Bitcoin you are fine I think. 
If you hold your investment for longer than a year, it is considered a "long term investment", which is taxed at a lower rate. Technically though, if you hold your BTC for at least a year, and are making less than 36k a year (including the bitcoin gains you withdraw), the tax on the gains part is 0% (If you have an income you still need to pay taxes on that). If you are a real BTC baller though, it is possible that you could quit your job (meaning you have 0 income) and withdraw 36K a year in gains and pay no tax (0%).

I was at the bar with a friend last night and he remembered me telling him about bitcoin back when it was $4. He said he heard on the radio that the price of Bitcoin fell a lot to $120. The fact that it fell in price didn't phase him at all, he was just super impressed that it was worth around $120 now and said he wished he had bought some back when I first told him about it.
The point is, sure the "bubble popped" but most people are just impressed that this weird thing they never heard of is worth over $100 to begin with. It makes them interested in the whole technology.

My assumption is that if a site like Amazon did accept bitcoin they would use a service like bitpay. They have a price in USD, get the current Bitcoin equivalent to display, people buy using their bitcoins and amazon instantly gets the USD via the serivce. With bitpay you can accept bitcoin and receive USD with virtually no risk.
People keep saying to not think of your BTC in terms of other currencies, but I think they are wrong (for now anyways). For now bitcoin's value is widely unstable, it would be foolish for any real business that accepts bitcoin to not use a service such as bitpay to have the bitcoins instantly turned into a stable currency.
Still, the more places that accept bitcoin (even if they receive a fiat currency on their end), the stronger the bitcoin economy will be.

I really can't tell you how many times I have been interested in buying songs or albums off of bandcamp but didn't because I was too lazy to enter in all my info.

It's going to be increasingly difficult. ASICMiner may have up to 1000TH/s alone by the end of the year (the current entire network power is ~65TH/s). Not to mention adding BFL and Avalon into the mix. CPU's and GPU's just can't beat out ASICs in a cost effective manner.

There was that one bank that is going to give users both a Bitcoin and a Fiat balance, I think that could be huge here. Imagine your bank allows you to easily convert between them. Suddenly holding fiat at 1% interest doesn't look as useful in your account as holding BTC which currently has increased about 742% since last year. Even just holding BTC in your savings as a small portion, "high risk high reward" investment for your portfolio would be more appealing.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:10:00
The answer is no. There are a number of things that could happen to bitcoin that will leave your wealth worth nothing. It is still very new and not worth that kind of risk. There are still too many unknowns (in terms of government policies at least), about bitcoin. I would suggest diversifying though, you could put a small chunk into bitcoin, and see how it goes.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:08:55
A better example would be you giving cash, not a check. Bitcoin isn't a replacement for things like checks and credit cards, though similar systems could be built for these kind of services on top of bitcoin. Bitcoin is more like cash, except with the ability to transfer it to anyone almost instantly anywhere in the world.

IMO since there are better ways that don't expose buyers to volatility during the purchase it isn't really a problem. Once you have the coins however it could be a problem, if the price starts to fall. However, generally the price of bitcoin seems to increase (though not always). Eventually, I hope, through growth we may be able to reach a level where the price cannot be easily manipulated.

I think 5btc is overpriced, but I think between 3 and 4 is right as long as the company remains stable and trustworthy. You can think about it like any standard "high risk" investment. It depends a lot on what people think is a "good" return. Let's say for example a 20% return in dividends alone is good to most investors vs the risk. At 5BTC/share, that would mean each share would need to return 1BTC in dividends a year. 1BTC /52 Weeks = .0192. So if you want a 20% dividend yield on your investment, ASICMiner will need to pay out an average of .0192BTC/week.
I personally think they should only be able to manage an average of .013 as a conservative estimate. Which means for a 20% yield the price would be around 3.38.
That's why I think 5BTC is definitely over valued.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:42:33

All ASICMINER shares are bought, sold, and managed privately through the bitcoin talk forums, so a passthrough is just a place where people can publicly trade them instead. Right now shares are being traded publicly on BTCT.co, Bitfunder, and now Havelock Investments. On BTCT and Bitfunder, buying one PT share is the equivalent of buying one ASICMINER share, and you can transfer out of a PT share and swap it for an ASICMINER share whenever you want, and vice versa. They are currently trading at around 1.46BTC/share with a weekly dividend of about .01BTC/share. You receive the dividends from BTCT or Bitfunder instead of from ASICMINER directly. They basically forward the dividends to you.
On Havelock 100 PT shares is equal to 1 ASICMINER share, so you would receive 1/100 of the dividend of a normal share, but it works out about the same (it is just more divisible). If you bought 100 shares on Havelock you could expect about .01BTC weekly. You receive the dividends from Havelock instead of from ASICMINER directly.
Basically passthroughs are just a way of representing real shares so they can be traded publicly easier, all the ones out there for ASICMINER currently allow you to redeem the real shares if you so chose.

It's simple:
It's very hard to get money out of Mt. Gox, making Mt. Gox dollars worth less than dollars on other exchanges, this means higher prices. As the price increases due to people trying to "get out" a gap grows between the prices of Mt. Gox and other exchanges. As this gap increases, more people are willing to take the risk of buying on an exchange with a lower price, and then selling on Mt Gox (and hoping they get their money at some point in the future). This is makes the price on other exchanges increase.

This is so true. Know what is a good way to not make bitcoin grow? Talking about how the governments will be overthrown or how some anarchist is deciding he's not paying taxes anymore because of bitcoin.

I think if we want a quality exchange these aren't really a problem. Bitcoin will have to become more professional if it wants mainstream acceptance.
Imagine if we were letting 24 yr olds who are novices mysql and php (bitcoin-24) run our stock market trading systems? It would be disastrous, just like it is with bitcoin.
When a competent, professional, funded, organization decides to build an exchange using industry standards instead of a magic the gathering trading card system, the whole bitcoin community will be better off. And part of this is a company not being afraid to get some lawyers and funding.
The question is how do we get there?

I agree. Plus to an outsider, if I say 1 BTC is worth over $120 they are like wow that is valuable! And they will most likely get interested. If I say 1 mBTC is worth $1.20 it doesn't sound impressive at all, why should I look into something that is similar in value to what I am already using? That doesn't gain my interest at all. An outsider doesn't know the difference between BTC and mBTC.
When I told my freind my Bitcoins were worth $5 each he was a little interested, when he learned recently via radio that they hit $260 and then dropped to $130 he was amazed that they were worth that much now. If I had told them they were worth $0.05 each and then said they are now worth $1.20, most people wouldn't register that fast enough to significantly gain their interest.
The whole idea that BTC instead of mBTC creates some psychological effect is nonsense. Both sides have-trade offs, personally I think BTC does more for Bitcoin's publicity than mBTC will do for whatever other peoples arguments are.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:26:25
I just want to point out one of the arguments against Litecoin. If ASICs are developed they will likely be more costly and have lower margins than Bitcoin ASICs. This is because Scrypt uses a balance of memory and processing power, (where as Bitcoin mainly uses processing power to brute force) meaning Litecoin was developed with GPU miners in mind, GPU's are already fairly efficient for mining Litecoin. This may sound nice, but then come in botnets. Botnets can use other people's computers to control large portions of the network and profit off them by mining. This is makes the Litecoin more vulnerable to botnet control (51% attacks) and exploitation(zombie mining) than Bitcoin, where ASICs can secure the network more effectively. Some say that Litecoin was only created so that botnets and gpu miners could continue to make money after Bitcoin goes ASIC. 
One more con, I have heard that Litecoin has less active developer(s), I think it is only one guy working on it his free time? I could be wrong on that though.
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:22:57
If you are making 5x as much money with Bitcoin, put enough away in something more secure and less volatile than bitcoin first if you are going to quit your job. Keep your job and keep earning with Bitcoin until you have enough money to create a diversified portfolio of assets to live on. If you have say 500k, invested in a large diversified portfolio with an average gain rate of 6%, you can gain about 30k a year, and pay 0% tax if you make no money at all with Bitcoin. As long as you hold the assets for at least a year. Then anything you make with Bitcoin on top of that is just icing on the cake.
Bitcoin's future looks bright, but it is still uncertain. I would hold on to that stable paycheck until you have amassed enough money to not have to worry about if Bitcoin dies a week from now. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:33:17
The advantage to a passthrough is you can quickly make trades if the price increases or tanks. Without a passthrough, you would need to make a post saying you are selling/buying shares and hope for offers, then you would have to have the person send the BTC and you would have to tell friedcat from ASICMINER that this new person now owns however many shares you sold them. Passthroughs make it so trading is seamless and instant instead by adding a layer of abstraction.
The downside to passthroughs could be that owning real shares and doing trades through the forum is more private and you don't have to worry about the site you are trading through shutting down.
Passthroughs all have good security though and regularly (daily) send friedcat of ASICMINER a list showing who owns what in case the site goes down. So if they do go down, you will get the real shares anyways. There isn't much to worry about. Just make sure you enable some kind of two factor authentication.

It is dropping from DDoS. Most bitcoin related sites are experiencing DDoS today. Whenever mtgox has trade lag it generally tends to upset the market, in fact it seems to happen at least once a week. The difference is this time it isn't just general trade lag because of a lot of people selling. It is the combination of DDoS lag causing panic which then caused a lot of people to freak out and sell (thinking the bubble is popped), amplifying the lag. You will notice the price was at $260 before the DDoS hit, then it spiraled downward. 
People commonly refer to gox lag messing up the market as getting "goxxed".

Always go with your gut instinct. I was thinking about getting a BFL miner a few months back and decided against it, now I am so glad I didn't. Instead I put my BTC into ASICMiner and since then share price in ASICMiner has doubled. Not to mention the benefits of not having to worry about maintenance, electricity costs, hardware issues, etc. It maybe be less profitable to go with ASICMiner in the short run vs Mining, but it is also less risky. With mining, you are basically investing in a single purpose machine that may/may not be completely useless in 2months to a year, depending on what happens.

That's why ASICMiner makes a lot more sense to me. 
They are mining themselves, but when they control too much of the market(hashing power), they sell some devices. Owning more than 50% (or even 35-40%) of Bitcoin's hashing power would make people lose some faith in the currency and destabilize their profits. 
Therefore it is in their best interest to sell some devices, they get money from people who buy the miners, and then get to increase their online hashing power (and therefore their dominance) without worrying about owning too much of the network. It's a win/win for them. The amount of BTC they get from mining stays about the same, but they also get BTC from miner purchases ontop of that.
This is also one of the reasons most people get their miners from them within a week of their order, they have no reason to take any longer than the minimal amount of time to deliver.

Bitcoin works as a digital currency because it is decentralized and open source.

The same can't be said about a close source program run by a corporation.
Google could not do better. Facebook DID try and make their own virtual currency system and I can't say I know a single person who has ever heard about it or mentioned it. Furthermore companies can be regulated by governments or influenced by investors, and not always for the better. Just look at paypal.

It is a bad time to get into mining honestly. You can try to buy or preorder ASIC rigs but you won't know when you will actually get it or if it will ever be profitable by the time you get it. I wouldn't touch mining until companies start to regularly ship machines on time and at reasonable prices. 
Alternatively you could buy about $10,000 worth of bitcoin and use it to buy 25 shares of ASICMiner and make ~$200/mo from dividends, but that is a pretty big investment for just trying to make some money on the side to help pay the rent (though on the flip side the investment isn't lost like it is with buying mining equipment, you can sell your shares at any time and get out if you want).

You are making a few wrong assumptions. First, that 8% is only what they are solo mining. They are also mining in the BTC Guild and a few other pools. From hashing along with the percentage they have, the estimated dividend per week is usually between .015 and .012, so for TAT that would be .00015 and .00012 per share. But it is more complex than that, they are also selling huge orders of asic devices, and the BTC from those sales are included on top of the profits from mining. Two weeks ago they sold of $1mil worth of devices in only a few days. Not to mention you don't need to worry about electricity or cooling costs, and you don't need to worry about your device becoming obsolete as ASICs advance. Lastly, there is the possibility your shares increase in value, where as if you buy mining hardware, it will only depreciate.

These ideas don't make any sense. You think the government is going to bring down bitcoin by participating in its economy buying or selling? Altering the blockchain? Why would anyone agree to do that based on a government just using Bitcoin the way it is meant to be used. Throwing away private keys? Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, that would have 0 affect other than making everyone who has Bitcoins much richer.
I can give you a real example of how a government could mess with Bitcoin instead though. A government could buy or develop a large number of Asics all at once and try a 51% attack. It would be very bad, but all nodes could always agree to "rollback" the blockchain, it wouldn't completely destroy Bitcoin. Attacking this way wouldn't make much sense though, it would cost a ton of money to do (and will cost an increasingly large amount as power increases), and it would just piss a bunch of people off. Still could happen though I suppose.

Wow a single Bitcoin is worth over $100? Maybe this is something I should learn more about, maybe it is a legitimate thing after all.
Few outsiders turned their heads when a Bitcoin was worth around $1. Switching to mBTC is a good way to kill interest with outsiders and thus decrease the value of Bitcoin. Do you think there would of been all that media attention and buzz if Bitcoin prices reached "$0.266 per mBTC?" If I knew nothing about Bitcoin I would laugh at that price, sounds like a made up currency worth pennies.
500 Amazon coins is $5? Amazon coins sound worthless. It costs 500 Amazon coins to buy something? Sounds expensive. 0.04BTC is $5? Bitcoin sounds really valuable. It costs only a 0.04 to buy something? Sounds so cheap! It works both ways depending on the perspective.

Warning: Not an accountant or tax expert. If you hold your asset for less than a year it starts at 10% of the gained amount.
If longer than a year (long term investment) then its if your combined income+gains is under $70,000 then the rate is 0%, if its over then the rate is 15% on the gain, if the combined income is more than $400,000 then it is 20% on the gains.
Note these are affected depending on whether you are filing jointly or single, I listed single rates.

It has always been like this. Bitcoin is an extremely interesting new idea, but that doesn't mean it is fully matured. If you can afford it, then sure investing a small portion into bitcoin could be a good part of a diverse portfolio. Who knows this new idea might just become something big one day. 
I roll my eyes however when I read posts about people putting all of their money into bitcoin, they must not of been around that week where the price dropped to about $1-$2 or during any of the previous exchange hacks. Bitcoin still has a lot of "growing pains" that it will need to get through before it can reach its true potential.
It used to be about security, exchanges were getting hacked all the time. Security has increased to a pretty good level now. Now the problem is server infrastructure for bitcoin services and the ability of anyone with enough money to manipulate the market. In a year or two it will be something else completely. My confidence in bitcoin is determined solely on how the market handles these hurdles, not whether it maintains parabolic growth for weeks.

If you encrypt something with a public key, only the person with the private key can read it, however if you encrypt something with your *private* key instead, anyone one with your public key can decrypt it. This proves you own a public key without people knowing your private key. You can prove your ownership of a public key this way.
* I take the message "I own this public key" and encrypt it with my private key.
* Now it is encrypted and looks like a bunch of random letters and stuff, I can send that encrypted message along with my public key.
* The message is sent to my peers, they use my public key to decrypt the encrypted message I sent and see it now says "I own this public key".
* It is verified that I am the owner of that public key. Because only someone with the private key could have created an encrypted message, that when decrypted by the public key read "I own this public key".
Since in Bitcoin funds are sent to public addresses, you only need to verify to the network that you are the owner of said public address in order to access those funds and do things like sending BTC.

1. Yes it is too good to be true. If you could indeed get a 50GH/s miner right now before everyone else it would pay off that kind of money, but BFL hasn't shipped yet, and the queue is sitting at about 20k+ orders. Originally they were supposed to have all their orders shipped back in October or something, but they keep moving their estimated shipping d ate further and further. I looked into getting one back in February and they said the first orders might start shipping in March, well now it is almost June and nothing. I think if you ordered one now, you probably wouldn't get it until September, but that is a hopeful guess, the people who ordered a year or more ago might not even have theirs by then. Plus BFL has continually proved to have horrible PR, incompetence, etc. At this point I wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole, there are too many unknowns at this point and they are pretty bad at articulating what's going on to their consumers.
2. Multiple reasons, it is a better business for the companies selling them because there is far less liability, sell the machine that is in extremely high demand and get your money, no need to worry about if bitcoin dies tomorrow, or has a crash, electricity/datacenter costs, etc. Another reason is to secure the network. Bitcoin gets it's power from being distributed, if one entity gained too much of the network power, it would destroy some confidence in bitcoin as a whole, which would then ruin their earnings, therefore it is better to have ASICs in the hands of many instead. Also there are some companies that are running them themselves. ASICMiner is one company that runs around 25% of the network currently, all their profits are then paid out to the companies' shareholders on sites like [BTCT.co]( recently they decided to get into selling ASICs as well, because like I mentioned, they don't want to run too much of the network because it will destroy confidence, plus they are way ahead of both Avalon and BFL in terms of production. ASICMiner is one of the few companies that you can actually buy ASICs from and get them within a few days (when they hold auctions for their machines that is), however the auctions for these machines are held on the bitcoin talk forums because they don't have a website yet, their prices are also much higher than the ones BFL lists, because there is a high demand.

They can also send faster I think if they are using a green address, which you can look up (I don't know much about it myself).

This is more ELI20 but anyways:
The Bitcoin network/protocol is basically a distributed peer to peer "cloud" that holds an automatically agreed upon (semi-anonymized) public list of who owns what and who has sent/received what (called the Blockchain). To add to this list aka by sending Bitcoins to someone, you use your private key to "prove who you are and what you own" and tell the network you want to send Bitcoins to an address of someone else's public key. Then for someone to prove they are associated with that public key address you sent to and receive access to that money, they will use their own private key. All this happens automatically and under the cover with Bitcoin clients, so it is much easier than it sounds.
Since there is no central authority, a transaction needs to be processed by the network in some way, so it can be agreed upon by the network as valid or not. Therefore transactions are "confirmed" by the "miners" who are essentially loaning their computing power to the network to perform the mathematical computations needed to confirm the transaction. For doing this miners receive a small transaction fee which is sent with along with a transaction when made by a user.

Sorry, but I don't think you understand how stocks work.
5 years for a normal stock to break even on dividends? Let's take PepsiCo, a company that is considered to have a high dividend yield for example. Last year they paid out a total of $2.12/share, with the current share price of 82.99, it would take almost 40 years to double your investment (or what you are referring to as "breaking even").
Furthermore, the way you are saying "break even" makes it seems like your investment is lost or something. If you buy 1 BTC for $100, that doesn't mean you "break even" at $200, you could sell your 1 BTC for $101 and you will have made a gain. It is the same when trading shares and BTC.

I would his advice with a grain of salt. I don't think he fully understands what he is talking about. For instance he talks about how they must have "massive reserves from their IPO", Their IPO generated roughly 17000 BTC, and that was over a year ago, when 1 BTC was only worth roughly $14. Meanwhile, they earned 10000 BTC this week alone, that's about $900,000 at the current rate. And they are earning near that every week pretty consistently.. 
He also talked about "old hardware", but from what I have read, that hardware was sold to miners long ago and swapped with newer more efficient machines. They are also always seem to be working on developing new hardware. I also believe friedcat (founder of the company) said they are working on 1000 TH/s by the end of the year. 
He was right on some parts though, currently they are selling mining hardware at very high prices due to the demand (they are the only ones selling pretty much), these profit margins will be unsustainable once more competition enters the market. Still, ASICMiner is way ahead of the game. They should be able to easily run 30-40% of the Bitcoin network, which should net you roughly 0.015btc/share every week. Any profits they get from selling mining hardware is just icing on the cake. 
ASICMiner has competent people and the money to stay on top, but the profit margins they are receiving from selling hardware is unsustainable once competition enters the market. However you should note it was never their plan to sell hardware in the first place, they just do it because having more than 30-40% of the network would hurt Bitcoin, so when they get too ahead in mining they sell some hardware so it isn't being wasted sitting around. 
Another good thing about this approach is you don't need to worry about maintaining hardware and can sell your shares and get out whenever you want (easier than trying to sell a mining rig).
He is right though if you are going to buy a lot of shares, it is risky right now since share prices are most likely inflated a bit since they have no competition in either mining or hardware sales.
If you have a near unlimited budget, I would buy a bunch of shares of up and coming mining companies instead. For example AMC (Active Mining) or Cognitive, put a chunk into a few different ones, if any become even mildly successful you will probably see share price double and could be receiving a steady cash flow from dividends. ASICMiner shares were worth 0.7btc for the longest time, now they are worth ~4.5btc/share. Could easily happen with the other up and coming mining companies.

Therefore, bitcoin creates its own market and worth, by being a better and more powerful system. The only think banks have on bitcoin is existing infrastructure and compatible systems already in place (atms, debit, credit card systems). Give it time though and bitcoin might just catch up.

According to that, if you're a miner and selling/exchanging less than $1000 a day you should be in the clear then right?
@_date: 2013-08-21 14:58:21
Yes, though I don't fully understand why, at least for assets like ASICMiner that are paying steady dividends (shares become worth more in USD but that also means the dividends are worth more, so I figured share value would stay the same, not decrease). 
Anyways, the last few times BTC vs Fiat price has increased, the majority of assets listed on BTCT have fallen in value, at least temporarily. I remember discussing it over at a few weeks back when the price jumped over $100 again.

If you get verified throught MtGox and have a Dwolla account with connected bank account for 30 days you can transfer with 0 fees (at least I paid 0 fees when I transfered 3k to gox this way). It's the most lengthy process, but also the most worth it if you are going to be transferring large amounts of money.

They are experiencing a large amount of trade lag most likely due to a combination of DDoS and panic (from traders like yourself).
When the DDoS began the trade lag was about 17 minutes, that was near the beginning though, causing the nosedive, I imagine with all the users panicking thinking the bubble has popped that the lag is even higher now.

You can designate prices. I can put my bitcoins on sale at $90 but until the price moves up to this point, no one will buy them.
Example, say there are 3 sell orders, one at $70 one at $75 and one at $80. One person buys the one bitcoin for $70, now the next lowest you can possibly buy a BTC is $75, moving the price up to $75.
Now say there are 3 buy orders also (for one BTC each). One at 65, 60, and 55. If I want to sell, the highest I can sell my 1 BTC is for $65. After I sell my 1 BTC (automatically filling that order) the highest I can sell for is now $60. If I sold another it would be $55.
This happens on a much larger scale, and the market is pushed one way or the other depending on how much is bought and how much is sold.
So if I put in a sell order for $1000 each for 10 BTC, it won't be filled until the market reaches that price (making my order the lowest price in the queue to buy at).

How long does it take a credit card company to confirm a transaction? 2 or 3 days maybe?
For small purchases, accepting 0 confirmation transactions (which most do these days) is fine, or an off-chain transaction could be used. 
There are ways to minimize risk of double spending when accepting 0 confirmation transactions. It is also very difficult to pull off a double spend, and risk is very low for something like a cup of coffee. Most double spend attacks rely on having a large % of bitcoin's mining power, which would be way too much effort for getting a free cup of coffee. For larger purchases it is still smart to wait for confirmations however.

Lost? What do you mean, I have the same amount of Bitcoins that I've always had. Unless you are buying high and selling low, you haven't lost. Bitcoin has a history of volatility, and frankly the community seems quite used to it by now. Right now demand is lower than supply, it's driving the price down, everything is working how it is supposed to be. There is no one to blame because of trade engine lag or exchange seizures. There really isn't much to discuss about it unless someone has some extra info that the community doesn't already know.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:13:53
Like 2 days ago at around $190, the next day it was $230, so I guess I got lucky. While its a risk to buy in so "late" you may also risk it never coming back down, which to me is an even larger risk. Though obviously don't spend money you aren't prepared to lose.
Personally I've had that kicking myself feeling far too many times and decided to just go for it. I remember when it was at $2.50 in fall of 2011 and then went up to $5 and I decided to wait. Looking back I really regret not even just dropping $100 then. I knew if it hit $500 I would regret not buying in even at $250. I also only invested half the money I originally planned though, just in case the price does fall, I can buy more.

It is kind of tricky actually. I think upon receiving them, he will have to pay income tax on the received amount in USD (at that time), however if he holds them and Bitcoin goes up say $10, the gained amount will be treated as capital gains in addition (but only when he exchanges it back for USD).
Basically the initial amount received would be income taxed by the amount of USD it was worth upon receiving it, but if he decides to exchange that BTC for USD at a later point, and the price of BTC has risen, the difference gained would be taxed as capital gains in addition.

These aren't really hurdles. The first are just psychological and not backed by any real data other than what 'some' people have heard other's perceive. There are equal arguments to both sides of the "units/decimals" debate, neither is a "clear fix", but I would say it makes more sense to stick with what we've got. I've had opposite experiences to yours, I tell people that 1 Bitcoin is worth $100 and they are impressed and see a Bitcoin as "very valuable", and instantly become interested in it/want to learn more.
Hardware wallets(Trezor) and Online wallet services(Coinbase), should solve problems for anyone too technologically inept to use bitcoin, as these become more refined, the better it will be. 
I don't think many people have said "I really want to buy $0.10 worth of Bitcoin but its too hard to get!", you would find trouble buying almost anything for 10 cents. I don't know anywhere that sells something for 10 cents except maybe a hardware store selling nails and stuff. If you want to play around with it try devcoin or an altcoin.

BTC per block shouldn't decrease any time soon. It's supposed to half every 4 years. I read somewhere that from current Jalapeno orders alone it is estimated that difficulty will rise by +30mil. In addition there are the other miners that BFL sells, Avalon's Miners and Chips, ASICMiner's reserve (about 200TH/s), KNCMiner, etc. It is extremely hard to estimate. By the time you get a miner from BFL, it could be "obsolete" or become "obsolete" in the time you think it will take to get a ROI. Since you aren't worried about electricity though I guess even if you are earning a dollar a day it may be worth it to you.

You can get it same day or next day with a cash deposit through many services (you bring cash to a location and they send it along). I haven't done it myself yet though.
You cannot buy bitcoin with paypal or credit/debit because of charge backs. Bitcoin has no regulating body and all transfers are final once sent and confirmed, which makes paypal/credit/debit too risky for bitcoin trading businesses.

Not sure why you are being downvoted, obviously some people don't understand risk. There are plenty of things that could happen that could cause bitcoin's price to dramatically fall, making your savings worthless, its only been around what, 3 years? Anyone with real savings (not a teenager working some part time job), would be extremely foolish to but their savings in bitcoin, not because bitcoin isn't great and growing, but just because there are way too many risks and unknowns. That said, if you aren't in a country with a large stable economy the risks might not be as bad in comparison.

Just a note on the risk of an exchange going down:
BTCT sends friedcat of ASICMINER the details of shareholders every 12 hours (I think), so in the event of BTCT going down, shareholder's shares would still be safe and honored by ASICMINER. I don't think bitfunder does this though.
The only real risk is something happens with ASICMINER, however they have been proven to be pretty trust worthy so far (frequent and transparent updates, delivering on promises, actual competency compared to companies like BFL)

My thought is: Get taxed now while your Bitcoins aren't worth as much. If I mined/earned $1000 worth of Bitcoins, I'd rather get those income taxed and be good for the future than wait till they are worth $100,000 and be taxed at a higher rate/try to explain that to the tax agencies.

Great post. I agree these are all things to address. I just hate when people act like Bitcoin is "too flawed" to make it as a currency. All other forms of currency have their problems too. Many of these problems can be fixed though, Bitcoin's strength is it gives everyone a choice in how it adapts to defeat problems. I hate when people act like Bitcoin is just "a stepping stone" and that a "Big Player such as Google" is going to come along and create the currency of the future.
Unless someone can create a currency that is fundamentally different from Bitcoin (in a way that Bitcoin couldn't just add the changes to it on the clients/protocol) and still have all the advantages Bitcoin currently has, I don't see Bitcoin going anywhere anytime soon.

Also if the company builds more reputation and more trust it could make share price rise. Currently shareholders are getting a 30% return on dividends alone (not even counting gains from share price), you would have a lot of trouble finding that kind of return with any normal stock. Since it is so risky though, 30% is reasonable. As it becomes less risky though, people may be willing to invest and receive only a 20% return for example, which could easily rise share price above 6btc. This will happen overtime if they can keep a stable position.

I will probably get downvoted for suggesting this, but this is why I think web based wallet services will need to become a thing in the future, at least for spending in person. Otherwise it would be like giving an IOU for 10 minutes from now. A trusted 3rd party could be used for the transaction instead. Just like a debit card, a bank knows how much you have, McDonald gets the money from the bank (trusted) via your debit, the bank deducts it from your account. A service could exist that could hold a small amount of bitcoins in an account for you, and you could do the transaction through that trusted service for purchases made in person.
It acts as a layer of abstraction so that confirmation time is instant and trusted. Like if there were a VISA for bitcoin or something.

I would wager that even if someone bought in now they will be fine for a couple weeks and could even make a good profit if they sell then.
I also think though that once ASIC's really start to hit the market in full force we will see the price drop, or at least a slowing down of the rate. Some people will want to pay back their invested amount to minimize the risk they take with purchasing an expensive single purpose machine.

Agreed, that's what I said in my post. I think ASICMiner is great and probably the most successful bitcoin company to date, but it would be stupid to invest in anything at a peak. Buy low, sell high. Though I doubt they will stop paying dividends, a fall in share price will likely happen.

A lot of people are forgetting a few things:
* AMD has been having financial troubles for years now, this probably isn't the kind of risk they can afford 
* If the PoW changes at any point, all the machines they are working on/created/sold are basically worthless instantly. That isn't good for business and could create angry customers. 
* Similarly, vulnerabilities, 51% attacks, government interference, manipulators, could all make bitcoin worthless in a short period of time, which would also be extremely damaging to the demand of the product.
It's just way too risky for a big company like AMD to enter this market considering both AMD and Bitcoin's current positions. Other markets: Desktops, Smartphones, Consoles, are much larger, and much more stable than Bitcoin, therefore it makes a lot more sense for AMD to develop hardware for these markets instead.

As long as you don't sell, you haven't lost any money yet. Let's assume that in the future bitcoin has an exchange that is competent and good, this whole bubble burst would of been avoided.
I think the only thing that can really kill Bitcoin is if either 1. A huge exploit is found rendering the technology useless. Or 2. The US government decides its people/businesses aren't allowed to use bitcoin anymore. I say as long as those two things don't happen, just hold on. In 2011 I felt like bitcoin was never going to get back up higher than that $30 mark, it seemed unreachable for the longest time, fast forward to 2013 it hit $260. I don't doubt that bitcoin will beat $260 sometime in the future.

I meant when you don't exchange for bitcoin, but when you get some from mining or sales for example, that is income taxed, better to have those taxed when say 100 bitcoins are worth $10 each than wait till they are worth $1000 each and try to explain that. You still need to pay gains if you exchange them back to usd at sometime. But if you only exchange a small amount at a time (up to 36k/yr if you have 0 income) you could effectively pay 0% tax rate on it.

"Recoup" and "cost" makes it sound like the money is lost. It is an investment, if you buy a share for 3BTC, receive a weekly dividend of .02BTC and then sell your share for 3BTC, the price you bought it for, you now have 3.02BTC, which is more than you initially had. 
In addition, an investment that is paying out the share price in dividends alone after only a single year likely doesn't exist, if it did, everyone would just easily double their money each year by investing it.

Yes. The development of ASIC Miners are the main reason for the recent increase, but right now we are still at the "tip of the iceberg". BFL and Avalon both have 100s of TH/s in development that the community expects they will be shipped to customers in the coming months. On top of that ASICMiner (this time referring to a company, not the machines) has about 200 TH/s to add in reserve once other companies/people add to the network so they can maintain a certain percentage. Right now the network is like 109 TH/s so it is going to increase by a pretty huge amount.
Still you could probably make *some* money for a few months, depending on how much your electricity costs are.

If you can get it tomorrow then yes. If you can get it in 6 months then no.
(Just to be clear: no, if you order now you won't get it until months from now)

People have been complaining on here about Bitinstant LONG before coinsetter was announced.

Did you only read half of my comment?

Meme pics and price announcing posts should be banned.

ASICMINER has already delivered on their promises on multiple occasions. They are always clear on what they are doing and already have a large (and growing) fleet of ASIC machines. I would trust them 100x more than BFL or rushed out Avalon machines.

Wasn't there talk of some bank in Germany that was going to give account holders both a fiat and a BTC balance?

There is definitely a market for it but you should work on your fee structure. 10% flat seems like a lot, it would be nice if there were alternative options. If I could pay a one time membership fee, or have diminishing fees over time/purchases, or put up collateral btc in my account until a waiting period has passed, alternative options like that would be cool. I don't know I'm just spitballing ideas.

It's not shady, ASICMINER is one of the most reputable companies in mining and hardware in Bitcoin out there. There are passthroughs on Bitfunder and BTCT too where 1 share = 1 ASICMINER share, that have been successfully running for a few months now (and getting dividends).

Yes and no. They also need to be proven and secure. There used to be many exchanges, they all got hacked, including MtGox. What we need are more exchanges with proven security, operating within the law, sufficient server infrastructure, and a general level of competence. Just running alternatives sites that don't do all of that will just hurt bitcoin further.

Remember you can always sell your shares though, it doesn't need to double your money for you to make gains. 
If I have 10btc and buy shares at 1BTC/share and then make 4BTC in dividends, and then sell your shares at 1BTC/share again, you now have 14 BTC. You can sell your shares at any time.

Hire a lawyer(s) and work within the law. 
Make sure the bank being used know what you are doing with your account and business. 
Hire penetration testers to try and hack your system BEFORE you release and again later/after. 
Have a plan for scaling up your operations (EC2/cloud/etc). And a plan for mitigation if a DDoS happens.

More often than not, there is nothing that stands out to me about a waiter/waitress if they do their job right. They ask what I want, bring the food, I eat, and then I give them a 20% tip for doing their job. It doesn't really make sense to me. Seems like restaurants just want other people to pay for their employees.
