i remember this vividly as I took as a sign that I should buy in right then and there
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:29:15
Yr math is off duder. Valued at same level of fiat market cap in multiple trillions means it will be worth MUCH more. We would just be dealing in much smaller decimals of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:54:26
This guy knows the deal
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:20:25
My MAN right here!
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:30:22
Currency represents value not vice verse
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:53:04
Have there been many problems with gemini?
My experience with them has been great
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:49:49
Nah this is the status quo bruh
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:43:02
I mean, im on the horse cause i love to ride. Catch my drift?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:11:30
No, bitcoin has utility. No stock does. The business apple does. You have *faith* that the stock represents a holding of apple. With bitcoin the utility is built into the actual product.
What exactly dont you get here?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:45:01
and yes the *intrinsic* value would be the same because of the same utility.
that is to say that currency is supposed to represent value, and not that value should all be estimated as represented by currency! 
c'mon, i know you can get this
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:33:49
He does own it because people *believe* he owns it.
The fact that bitcoin is a cryptographic public ledger capable of tranferring data does not change with peopkes belief. That is exactly what it is, it always will have the value of that quality 
.......c'mon dude, its a relatively easy concept to understand
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:18:14
you just repeated what was already said.
i dont disagree that any of this is true *excepting* that cryptos have intrinsic value because of the technological utility they offer while fiat and stocks do not inherently posess the same value, or any other value.  All fiat and stocks have value because of the *belief* in their value, they don't have an underlying function besides that belief. Cryptocurrencies, each and everyone of them, do.
Like I said, you have it backwards.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:38:38
You keep repeating yourself
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:05:57
Gemini is the best
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:44:35
You have refuted nothing I have said. Stocks have NO intrinsic value, their value REPRESENTS a partial ownership of a company and that is FAITH based. Cryptocurrencies very existence is that of intrinsic value because each one performs a function as a matter of course. In order for it to exist it necessarily has to own the value of the function it performs. This function is a part of its existence whether or not it is ever actually used.
...seriously.... Goodnight and good luck with your bet against technology. Bye
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:41:52
You seem to have some misunderstanding of what belief and faith are.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:01:35
Each coin offers different forms of cryptographic exchange. Some with very finite parameters, such as bitcoins public ledger, and some are veey abstract, such as ethereums "decentralization of everything" approach.  
Each and every crypto performs some function inherently,  its new technological territory and its great
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:44:32
Each and every crypto currency *PERFORMS A FUNCTION*, it is no more a batch of numbers than you are "just" strands of dna
this is inherently of value, it is built in to it.
Much like nutrition is built in to food, even if it doesn't get eaten the nutritional valueis still there.
This is what stocks and fiat do not have
Edit: typos
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:06:22
youve got it backwards. currencies and stocks are people simply agreeing.  bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually provide *real* utility.
I agree bitcoin itself may seem ineffective at its purpose currently, but the foundation of its economy is its utilitarian and technological value.
Bitcoin was the first, and it has a stranglehold on the market, and perhaps it will have the best innovation and stay on top for quite a while.  There are many alt coins that serve bitcoins initial purpose better than bitcoin at this point.....
Anyhow the point is that cryptocurrency's value has a *real* foundation while fiats value, and even stocks(as they dont directly serve a purpose, merely represent an ethereal ownership of a company with which most people can do nothing) have less intrinsic value than any functioning crytpocurrency. in the future i imagine most finance will be hosted on any number of blockchains.
good luck betting against technology, the apocalypse is your only hope.
EDIT: i can't understand why this is getting downvoted w/out being rebutted
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:59:08
The company is not useless. The stock represents the belief that one is part of that company, or owns part of it. Which is contrary to the truth, it is faith based.
Also, you apparently dont understand how bitcoin works... Which is beside the point. But the ownership is inherent to the currency.
These new bitcoin futures etc... They are *also* faith based.
You keep saying the same things and failing to rebutt my point

@_date: 2014-10-29 14:19:54
Yeah, I have two factor authentication turned on.  It makes sense to me to have it. I think when I invest more I will dive into putting it on my own wallet. Can I keep a wallet on a jump drive or sd card?  How do I spend this stuff as well? Is there any word of being able to spend it at amazon or ebay in the future?
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:48:01
well, they can just trade for it if they choose.    I think most people are interested in it anyhow, just dont have a clue at all how to do it. Also, like I said, it is for people who I would be buying a tie for otherwise, or socks.
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:59:00
"A dollar has intrinsic value because the US government says it does" is an oxymoron
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:44:30
Ok I just got started with coinbase and now I have to wait a couple days.  Does that mean I also have to wait to get that $5?
@_date: 2014-12-04 13:42:37
Great thanks guys!  I thought it would be something along these lines, so blockheight is just a portion of the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:07:28
I just dont know what this is, is this some kind of scam?
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:45:45
OK so my biggest problem understanding is public and private wallets. There is a downloadable wallet that keeps all of my bitcoin on my hard drive? this is what I should use?
@_date: 2014-10-29 17:09:02
Whoa 
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:17:27
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:21:34
hahahha, clever.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:32:28
Ok so a huge help to me would clarifying what ETF 
Means exactly .
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:09:26
please tell us how, we're out here trying.  imagine having to fight the dragon while sitting on its shoulders. real tough
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:12:21
Really? That would be difficult.  
How do you think I can become sleazier?
What money should I use instead?
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:02:54
I hear that! I bought one bitcoin at 300.....  I ve been waiting for a drop for a while, wasn't sure if it actually would.  Once it hits 100 I am buying more.
@_date: 2015-01-18 19:52:59
ah this is great! that was part of my dilemma, I WOULD want to keep some as bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:02:09
Well, I guess i have had a different experience than most folks, because whenever I have brought up the technology it has generally been cause for intrigue and discussion, maybe yen would be more practical, but it wouldnt be as interesting. THis would give folks something to check out and play with. I can always give cash if I want to, and I can also buy someone a tie, but this is money that is also at the forefront of a new technology which a good majority of the people I have spoken with have found at least worth a bit of investigation. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:07:23
100 is my mark.  I agree with the use, we as a community need to use it more!   The more it is used, the more intrinsic value it will hold.  
Cryptocurrency is here to stay, there is no doubt about that.  Will bitcoin remain the dominant force? Nobody really knows, but I believe it enough to invest in it and so did everyone else here!  It has more support than any other electronic currency available and a larger and more complete infrastructure to boot.....
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:04:51
I feel like the entire hype has only been positive and either decision would have had its own, unique benefits.
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:20:36
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:51:39
it is great! they just need more people using it. im on there, but it's more or less a ghost town
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:19:00
waiting for the correction to buy MORE

Alright, this is lame now isn’t it?
It is, it *really* is
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:00:08
That’s what they were called! I couldn’t remember
@_date: 2019-02-06 12:19:20
Ha I started at 2400 and then didn’t upgrade until 28.8. Used to love the old text based rpgs you could find on bulletin board services
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:36:27
I have thought a lot about this, and i really think what would be the most approachable form to change to is simply bits. Value individual bits and track value as such.
It rolls off the tongue, and is mentally easily connected to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:41:10
I already have
@_date: 2019-02-08 01:53:13
6 years of this talk
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:57:33
I eventually made a decision to buy based on the fact that i wanted to support the technology. I love the idea of gaining wealth for sure, but id take universal p2p adoption over luxury any day of the week.
Its about the technology and the spearhead of a shifting paradigm
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:32:18
Bitcoin, cryptocurrency and the associated technologies certainly should not be viewed as financial powerhouses.
However, when the topic moves to applicable technology the cartoon becomes infinitely relevant.
And then as the spearhead of a shifting paradigm.... Wellll i suppose thats just a matter for us to see
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:56:27
This is awesome, everything i read about the winklevoss twins makes me like them more.
I still feel like im supposed to hate them though.
Whats up w that?
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:21:57
Welp, if 4000 isnt enough proof that people are *actually* interested I think we are just looking at a future full of geezers questioning their day to day reality
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:49:29
yep...bought mine at 250 after gox....been hodling ever since.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:50:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:35:32
yeah  like i said, this isnt the advice im looking for. 
and just to be clear  I mean investment like I would refer to anything of value. so food is an investment, a car, a couch a video game. just about anything I in some way would trade time for
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:43:39
I own gold and bitcoin, but only because I found the gold. hahahahahhaha.  Bought a house and there was an ounce of gold left in an old box in the basement, pretty wild.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:30:42
I am never selling
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:17:19
1 coinomi
2 Jaxx
buying a nano ledger s soon
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:24:36
The more the paradigm shifts toward p2p, the less likely a giant cyber attack is.
Proliferate bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:01:58
Thanks, now ill buy some more
