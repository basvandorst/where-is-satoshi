Because scammers are not nearly as prevalent as you might think. Stay away from selling high value electronics and you'll be fine.

Index funds/mutual funds/ETFs can be very broad and so are very difficult to predict but say you are looking at individual stocks, then you can have a pretty good idea of what's a good investment and what isn't. Things like the P/E ratio can show you whether or not the stock is undervalued. This ratio is very important for those who want to get a good deal on a stock.
10k annual reports provide detailed info on the direction a company is heading. Let's say a company is reporting strong earnings, in most cases that stock price is going to go up and vice versa. 
If a company stops paying dividends, that's a pretty good sign that something is wrong. If a company is buying back it's stock then that's good because it will increase the value of that stock.
If you look back at the companies that have failed over the years, many of them share a trend. They had very high debts so if you see that a company you want to invest in has a large amount of debt then you would probably want to stay away from them. 
All this is just an intro into the things you need to be aware of. You would be surprised as to how many people have made good money just studying the market by themselves and making good decisions. You aren't gonna get rich overnight though, good investing is a long process. My advice is to start early and never invest more than you are willing to lose if you are concerned about risk. I can't help but cringe when people here say they've got over 50% of their net worth into bitcoin, it is incredibly stupid to risk that much money just because people are clamoring that they will become millionaires. When it comes to investing you'd be much better off making your own decisions. There's several podcasts where you can learn about investing if you're interested, i'd recommend the Money Tree Investing podcast to start.

That's not really true at alll you know. I mean if you just open a brokerage account and start throwing money at stocks then yes that is no different than gambling but a good investor will do hours of research and going over a companys financials prior to investing. Doing this will dramatically lower any risk so I wouldn't consider that gambling. Bitcoin is different though because it is so voloatile that It doesnt matter how much research you do.

Whatever you do don't take out a loan to buy bitcoin based on this.
