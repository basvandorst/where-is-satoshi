Very unintelligent letter. Of course, all of his "arguments" about how bitcoin can be used in illegal transactions can also be said about cash, or any currency, or silver or gold. Plus, bitcoin has a relatively small market cap-what about the trillions in derivatives frauds? He seems to see the fact that bitcoin might appreciate as a disadvantage (?), and he carelessly (for a Senator) confuses the word "weary" with "weary".

"Weary" for "wary". Minor, true, but it does not help his "case"....

This is a very good and more successful strategy, IMHO. Stay positive, and avoid ideological attacks on well defended powers, except when absolutely necessary. Great user name too!

Yes I do. The effect is the same. Gone is gone. It's an analogy.

It needs to be said over and over. The arguments that politicians and corporate types use are getting worse and worse. I don't think that bitcoin has a  monopoly on illegal activity. Any currency, silver or gold can be used for illegal activity. Where is Manchin on the trillions in derivatives fraud, which threaten everyone's assets? They just think the public is dumbed down. People need to wake up and think!

Plus, let's not forget the 46 billion pounds of taxpayer bailout money that the Royal Bank of Scotland lost. That dwarfs Mt. Gox. Should we ban the pound too?:

So totally true....
