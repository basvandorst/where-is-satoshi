Rule of thumb for software development: if you haven't already coded up the feature, don't act like it's easy or simple to do. There are *always* complications and corner cases that you haven't considered.

IMO, it requires (political) education. To citizens of developed nations with strong banking services and "stable" currencies, the only benefit of Bitcoin is its decentralized, cryptographic, peer-to-peer nature. If you love the Fed and you trust your bank, Bitcoin is a non-starter. People have to be convinced that (1) they should want to manage their own wealth, (2) they should want a non-managed deflationary currency, and (3) they should not be okay with government ability to seize bank accounts and otherwise restrict financial freedom. I think there a quite a few people on this subreddit who don't believe this - and they're probably just interested in bitcoin for speculative profit.
There are still abstractions and tools to be developed that make bitcoin easier to use and more approachable, but we shouldn't strive to meet traditional banking 1:1.

Well, if people stopped mining, it would lose all its value. Also, I think a lot of value comes from having competent developers who are working to solve the problems *we know* are going to happen in the future. If the developers go away and no one takes their place, Bitcoin's value will dry up.

I believe that institutionalized theft is incredibly damaging to society, especially when the expropriated funds are used to wage war and imprison swaths of marginalized people for committing victimless crimes. Your argument for taxation is that you like the things that the state does. My argument against taxation is that I hate the things the state does. I'm not going to to convince you of anything here, but don't act like you have the moral or rhetorical high ground.
As far as bitcoin goes, I see it as an important tool for building grey and black markets and generally promoting agorism. In the short term, we've seen that people will eagerly pay their taxes on bitcoin transactions in a misguided attempt to legitimize bitcoin. In the long term, bitcoin may facilitate an increase in the number of transactions that can escape state surveillance.

Basically impossible if you're running an up-to-date browser and a modern OS. Just don't run any suspicious executables that are downloaded.
EDIT: To clarify, it is possible. I was able to find a few examples of zero-day browser exploits in the past few years that allowed attackers to run arbitrary code simply by serving malicious javascript. However, these exploits are rather difficult to code, and so the vast majority of malicious sites you encounter rely on you being ignorant (e.g. phishing or running random executables). Also, a given exploit tends to only work on a specific operating system and if other specific vulnerable software is installed. So from my point of view, the risk is negligible. 99% of virus/malware prevention is not being an idiot.

I partially agree with this, but I think the community has made it clear that changes to the fundamental economics of bitcoin will *never* be accepted, for good reason. It might have been good to bake in some perpetual inflation from the start, but it will also be interesting to see how a perpetually deflating currency behaves, as I don't think it's ever been tried before.

There are actually a few different cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin, so if vulnerabilities were discovered in one it could be phased out and replaced with a better one. For example, if attacks were developed for SHA-256, this would bypass mining difficulty (allowing attackers to dominate the block rewards), but it wouldn't affect the ECDSA transaction signing method and wouldn't expose users' private keys. As noted in other discussions about this, vulnerabilities are usually not catastrophic. That is, usually people discover a preimage attack that requires less (but not zero) work.

But if you want to manage your own wealth and not have your livelihood subject to whims of banks and government agencies, bitcoin is the answer.

I get the idea, but I don't think adding abstraction would really lead to more adoption. IMO, the primary attraction/value of Bitcoin is that it can be used without relying on banks and other corruptible parties. If you take away that aspect by promoting off-blockchain layers that try to mimic our current system, then there's really no apparent benefit compared to using USD. For citizens of countries with stable currencies and good banking services, the only benefit of Bitcoin is in its decentralized, cryptographic, peer-to-peer nature. Citizens of less developed countries may benefit from being able to use a better currency, but overall education is necessary to show why Bitcoin is worth using.

A prepaid card is basically like a gift card that you load with cash and then use like a debit card. I guess it's a way to have the convenience of a card without having a bank account - but no credit is actually being extended.
Another option is a secured credit card where you have to put down collateral (e.g. $1000), and then you get credit equal to that amount. These are intended for people with poor credit to improve their score by making regular on-time payments. I'm sure OP could use either of these options.

The probability is not just "ultra low." It's on the order of walking through a wall due to quantum tunneling. If it actually happened, it would either be exceptional luck (unlikely) or (more likely) evidence of a faulty RNG that the software developer should be made aware of.

Theoretically, when a block is invalidated by an attacker, its transactions should just go back into the mempool and wait to get included in another block. Therefore, the transaction would not be reversed but just delayed until such time the attacker no longer has &gt;50%. What you are calling reversal is just prevention.
Although, in reality, the mempool is limited so eventually these transactions would be dropped and transactions could be reversed if &gt;50% is maintained for a sufficient period of time.

By convention, 6 confirmations is often considered "final" since that's what the reference client uses. According to the [wiki]( this is based on the analysis that an attacker with 10% hash rate can still double spend with 0.1% probability after 6 confirmations. But from your point of view as a customer, the transaction is final as soon as you send it out to the network with a tx fee - it will eventually be included in the blockchain. It's the merchant that has to worry about double-spend attacks by the customer, and this is solved by waiting for sufficient confirmations.
A tx with n confirmations just means that it's been included in a block that's n deep in the blockchain - that is, (n-1) blocks have been mined after it and covered it up. The system is designed so that a block takes 10 minutes to mine, so each confirmation should take on average 10 minutes. However, since the hashrate has been increasing so quickly lately, blocks are only taking about 5-8 minutes to mine on average.

If you both use Coinbase, you can send bitcoin to an email address. 
Of course, integration with Namecoin is the superior solution in the long term.

One problem with this is that unlike bitcoin addresses, names and emails do not have a built-in checksum. Human-usable addresses are subject to human error.

I completely disagree. Bitcoin is not as complicated as you seem to think. The key innovations relate to distributed computing (i.e. byzantine fault tolerance). There is no special knowledge needed about cryptography or math or economics. Proof-of-work and many other facets of the protocol build upon previous attempts at cryptocurrencies (which had been unsuccessfully attempted for years prior to Bitcoin). SN would have only needed a practical working knowledge of cryptography to implement Bitcoin - there are no innovations in that field. And any libertarian (with or without any economics background) would have structured the money supply in a similar way. I find it totally reasonable that SN is only one person.

It can be a gradual transition. Businesses accept BTC because of reduced fees and counterparty risk. Then they want to pay their employees with BTC to reduce currency exchange fees.

The early adopters will certainly end up with more wealth, but that's their reward for taking the early risk (dealing with high volatility, unscrupulous companies, and security risks).

You haven't explained what are the unfixable flaws in Bitcoin that make it difficult to use. And you haven't explained what features a new currency would have that makes it superior. You're basically assuming that some company is going to introduce a fundamentally superior currency. Why haven't they already done so? Why can't a non-corporate entity develop the same thing?
I don't get why a company would be interested in promoting a currency. If it's decentralized in the same way Bitcoin is, then they would have no reason to prefer it. If it's not decentralized (or it's integrated/tied to services in some way), then it would be fundamentally inferior to Bitcoin and no one would use it.
And you still aren't understanding my first point, which was that the new currency would have to be fundamentally superior to Bitcoin to gain *any* adoption. It would have to once again change how we think about finance in the same way that Bitcoin did. This is because the network of users and merchants and services is already in place and makes it vastly more valuable than similar competitors.

The "audit" consisted of checking one Coinbase-supplied address to make sure it had the funds it was supposed to and was controlled by Coinbase. There was no code audit and no verification that their on-paper operating processes were actually followed in practice. Andreas was clear that it wasn't comprehensive and shouldn't be given too much significance. It's basically anti-FUD to suggest that the audit really meant anything.

I think bitcoin ATMs are a silly idea in general. I don't understand who their target user is. New users are not going to invest in a volatile startup currency just because they see a box on the street. And established users surely have better, faster, cheaper ways of purchasing bitcoin (e.g. Coinbase). Even ignoring the fact that they require intrusive amounts of information, I don't think ATMs are useful outside their novelty.

A node is any system connected to the network that has a full copy of the blockchain and helps relay information (blocks and new transactions) to other users. Most users have no need to run a full node, so you don't need to worry about downloading the blockchain. Look into simple payment verification (SPV) if you want to know more.
The blockchain size (and block size) is a real problem in the long term, and definitely one that needs to be addressed before bitcoin can reach mainstrean adoption. There are several academic proposals to solve it, but nothing close to implementation as far as I know.


Your intuition is reasonable. It's unlikely any altcoin will ever displace bitcoin, so I don't think users will have to worry about switching on a regular basis. The winner has already been chosen, so any improvements will have to be integrated into the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:25:32
As others have noted, the system described in this paper differs substantially from Bitcoin. From network structure, to the notion of a "coin," to double-spend prevention, to the method of quorum, there are large differences that make it unlikely the two systems are directly related. Bitcoin was only the most successful of many different attempts to design an e-cash network.

The scenario you described is somewhat plausible, but it's also very niche.

Well, it's not bad but it will never happen. There's no reason for anyone to use a currency marketed toward a specific country, when bitcoin is worldwide and already being used by far more people (and is therefore far more valueable).

It follows the same rules, halving every 2140 blocks or whatever the number is. Since the blocks come much faster, the schedule is compressed relative to the main network. They also occasionally reset it (currently on testnet3).

The idea is that the operating system should never have been connected to the Internet (not that the physical laptop remained unconnected). Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems for a variety of reasons. But by putting it on a removable drive, you can have easy access to a completely fresh (unconnected) OS on any laptop or desktop. This can't be done with some OSs (e.g. Windows) due to their bloated, inflexible nature and strict licensing.

Network effect. Unless you're interested in technical experimentation, bitcoin is far more valuable then any altcoin. If you want to buy stuff, or sell stuff, or just save, bitcoin offers far more possibilities than any altcoin, which makes it the most attractive. Causal users don't want to take the time to study different currencies, they want to use what their friends are using and merchants accept, which is bitcoin.

I've never used a prepaid card, but I believe you can just go a store (e.g. walmart) and buy it off the self. Since you don't need to go through a bank, literally anyone should be able to get one and use it to buy stuff online, which the OP is claiming he is unable to do.
Most people should also be able to open a checking account with a bank and get a debit card connected to it. As long as you have enough money to keep a minimum balance and pay the fees (if applicable), the bank shouldn't care about your credit or employment.

As it says, those files are the chainstate so you can't delete them without going out of sync. Either your copy of Bitcoin Core is a malicious imitation, or the virus scan is a false positive. Can't say without knowing how you installed the software and the general state of your computer.

1. How are you mining? What pool, program, hardware, etc? In some shape or form, you have to designate a payout address before starting to mine.
2. Please read through any/all of the links on the sidebar. Credit cards are basically the financial opposite of bitcoin. In order to use bitcoin, people give you their address, and you use your wallet software to send them some XBT.
3. No, it's not normal. What kind of hardware do you have? If it's just a CPU, be aware that you will never see any payout from mining.
4. Yes, I believe you should still be able to see incoming transactions to your wallet addresses. If you don't want to wait for the sync, download the blockchain bootstrap or switch to a light client.

Use a real exchange, where you can place a limit order. Exchanges will also typically have lower market prices than Coinbase and charge lower fees.

No other coin will gain acceptance unless there is a serious flaw in Bitcoin.

I don't really get your point about steady growth (since Metcalfe's law says nothing about growth), but that's not important. Quadratic is not "near" exponential, so please do not conflate the terms. The are not close. Quadratic functions are approximately as far from exponential as zero is.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:12:12
You're right, I used confusing terminology. To clarify, Metcalfe's law says the value (in an subjectivist "economic" sense) increases with the square of the number of network participants. By growth, I was referring to this quadratic value function.
You seemed to be using growth to refer to the number of participants (and possibly the price value). ML does not make any inferences about how the number of participants increases with time (and certainly none about the market price of products like bitcoin). Such predictions may be plausible, but additional arguments must be made.
Regarding the quadratic/exponential comparison, analysis is usually performed asymptotically. As the number of network participants grows very large, my comparison was reasonable. See [this graph]( Even with only a thousand participants (bitcoin has far surpassed this), x^2 and 0 are indistinguishable compared to 2^x . No matter how the constant factors are adjusted, this relationship holds asymptotically.
Regarding my thoughts on bitcoin generally: well, I've become more bearish lately. I don't think it has many merits as a payment system relative to existing banking services, and there are serious protocol changes that have to be made before mass adoption is even possible. (The politics of bitcoin are what interests me.) Tons of people in the community are obsessed with making "to the moon" predictions and many believe that altcoins are a serious investment, which together tell me that bitcoin is probably overpriced. It seems like most people don't understand why they like bitcoin.
