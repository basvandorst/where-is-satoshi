Adding Bitcoin currency conversion.  Did you not even read the title?

As someone of Hispanic origin, this slur saddens me.

Did you just space out your post to make it sound more dramatic?

I see your point, HarumthurRanados.  I am a local manager for a division within a company and I have too seen suspicious Bit Coin activity.  I have started filling out the required paperwork to terminate the offending employees.  I simply can not have my sector under the risk of drug trading and pot smoker activities.

"Conspiracy" is kind of a strong word for what's most likely some guy getting a laugh out of how naive this community is.
I personally think the reactions to his posts are hilarious

He's obviously Spanish, I know it seems simple to tell sarcasm in your native language but its much much more difficult in another, even if you're fluent.  I don't think I could tell Spanish sarcasm despite speaking it near fluently.
Give him a break.  ~~Cunt.~~ Inconsiderate person.

It's like Christmas all over again when the neckbeards gave paper wallets to relatives in order to preach Bitcoin to them.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:37:02
Bitcoin sucks and will always suck for brick and mortar purchases.

@_date: 2014-02-27 17:35:39

@_date: 2014-02-13 17:07:02
I'm very sorry I hurt your feelings
@_date: 2014-04-09 02:00:50

@_date: 2014-07-25 01:55:26
No shit dumbass, what did you expect?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:28:31
Not accurate enough.  Need more sig figs.
@_date: 2013-12-25 08:29:33
Quite deserving of a gentle nod of my brimmed headgear, I should say ;)
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:50:45
It was a reasonable "lol".  I understood the meaning behind it.
