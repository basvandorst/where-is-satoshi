The U.N does not believe it's own science based releases. In 1989 a warning was provided via the U.N that we had until around the year 2000 to correct CO2 emissions or we would pass the "tipping point". In 2018, the U.N seemed to have disregarded their prior warning and provided a new warning with the same basic claim except the year is now 2030.
Nasa has openly and consistently modified various historic temperature graphs. I could elaborate on this, but will refrain. I was recently on a Nasa webpage where you could hover over the changing historic charts. Nasa does not even trust their own historic U.S based data.
The EPA seems to have have left their U.S heat wave index graph intact, thus is pretty much contradicts what NASA try to promote (1998 record heat!!). [

You surely don't live in the most populace Islamic parts of town. The true working class do that. I care not for the gracious Islamists I know, in the context of an Islamic dominated society. Just this year I spent a lot of time with one Islamist introducing him to cryptocurrencies. Big deal. Individual cases matter not. I usually don't dislike Islamic individuals (how could you insinuate that!). It is the overall composition of Islam within a society and what that amounts to as the population percentage increases. Britistan is slowly building. The laws and regulations will change to favour Islam. To say something negative about Islam may mean penalties or arrest (it is already heading that way). 
I've spent time in Egypt. Like most POC countries, they are OK to a certain extent, but you get sick of the open corruption after a while. I thought I was going to be executed in Cairo. Life!

I care not for the nuances. The big picture sees Islam becoming a major force across Western Europe. We are still in the early stages. Breeding and ongoing muslim immigration are going to wipe out Europes diversity long term.
I've spent time in Egypt (actually thought I was going to be executed there). Besides that, I was spent time in Cairo with a hard core SJW who wore mini skirts there and was allegedly nearly raped either in Morocco or near there on the west side of Africa.
Even here in Australia I see examples of the effect of Islam as it grows in strength. The most prosperous societies have existed with Christianity as a core to those societies. Currently, we are eradicating Christian values and breaking down nuclear families, as we follow the intersectional feminist "equality of outcome" nightmare ahead.

All of the people on this Earth today come from tribes that will have survived horrible conflicts with other tribes for land area and resources. Just like the further animal kingdom, some species don't last. Many human tribes will not have survived the centuries. Human's are hierarchical creatures whether we like it or not. The problem with power, is that it leads to corruption. As resources change alone, it will lead to future conflicts. Most people on the planet don't want war. At the moment, Islam is taking on a lot more power as it takes Western Europe. Once Islam takes full control of Western Europe and full control of the nukes, things are going to light up.
Some nations on Earth may want to have some sort of welfare system for the mentally disabled and those who truly can't work to afford the modern luxuries that keep them alive. A nation can't do this unless it has protection of it's borders. Economic sustainability. This applies to your own home. You can't just open your home up and offer everyone a meals and shelter. It is economically not sustainable.
Generally, there is no "equality" within nature. Look within your own home or family! We can't all live in mansions by the seaside for many reasons. Plus, some mansions are going t have much more spectacular views than other mansions. Nothing is equal. Envy and greed are a part of human nature.

'Fascist' has various facets to it. Some left, some right. Like everyone else I come across, I would not be totally opposed to some aspects of fascism. As per all inhabited continents, the Aboriginals fought for territory between tribes. The settling of Aboriginal lands by European's was a form of conquering, not unlike the conquering of European lands. Take the numerous conquering of England for example. (White slav/ic slav/es) The raiding of Europe and enslavement of somewhere around 1 million white under North African muslims comes to mind. Anyway, I am definitely not opposed to Aboriginals having their own regions, and personally would like that. I do not seek to persecute Aboriginals from one tribe who massacred another tribe in the past.
I currently regard most of western Europe including Britain as practically conquered by Islam. So be it.

For many painfully obvious reasons:

* One "multicultural" planet would be as boring AF. Already, western run "multicultural cities" are becoming same same clones. A variety of nations assist for a variety of cultures.
* Who is going to run the global nations govt and how big is the govt to be? Are we going for some Marxist "equality of outcome" global hell hole?
* One nation with one set of laws. If you can't see the issue with that, ask Binance why they moved to Malta, or Coinjar, why they moved their base to London. Ask Chinese crypto exchanges why they relocated out of China!
* One government means you can't compare govts around the world for functional policy vs dysfunctional policy. No choice!!! The average millennials utopian dream!
Nationalism is still required by a global nation. Without it, the nation is at risk of breaking back down into diverse nations.

Ive'spent cryptocurrencies across nations.   I was in India at the time they banned the $500 &amp; $1000 rupee notes (2016)...which actually caused some real inconvenience, although nothing to the level of many poor Indians.
I spent Dash on iced coffees in HoChiMinh prior to Vietnam's ban on the spending of cryptocurrencies on goods. Like China, Vietnam carries the communist legacy to this day, and thus it is of zero surprise that these countries are among the first to clamp down on cryptocurrency use.
The value of having decentralised nations as we currently have, is that companies like Coinjar relocate nations to stay alive. Binance has apparently done a similar thing with relocation to Malta. 
Some things are globalist: Atmosphere, Internet (almost), cryptocurrencies, satellite TV stations.....etc.
Cryptocurrencies are a passive option for worldwide participation, they are not a globalist government presiding over a global nation. There is a massive difference. Governments typically utilise force to rule. Decentralisation of nations and government on this Earth creates for valuable governmental diversity. A single government could easily do as Vietnam has done, and ban cryptos in the way they have done, with the punishment as death. There would be no other nation to compare the global nation to.

Australia. My political ideology would embrace the need for diversity of nations rather than one global nation. Within those hundreds of nations, Japan can stay Japanese, and South Korea mainly Korean, as they see fit. I have no issue with citizenship for Africans only in Liberia. I have no issue with "multicultural" nations for those who prefer them.
Personally, I would want to live in a nation that is capitalist based, with a majority of people of European heritage for social cohesion matters and values. I would probably wish for national regulations that actually eject Marxists from the nation. I am not opposed to nationalised health care to a certain degree...and other social safety nets.
I currently consider that most western nations are dying due to multiple forces. These include, globalist media companies, Marxists in education especially, intersectional feminism, socialists etc. So the current models don't work long term. I am no social engineer and don't have all the answers.
4 out of 5 of America's majority minority states voted for Hillary. The democrat party is pretty much pro-globalist, along with the wish for no borders. People of non-European heritage won't care as much for European societal legacy (fair enough). Londonistan, as I call it, is already under an Islamic mayor, with a population would also vote for open borders (thus globalism). One nation. No choice.

All walls and fences are borders. House and business walls are borders. Tribes across the continents over thousands of years have had borders and tribal grounds. Due to the hierarchical nature of human beings, you won't have a world free of nations. At best, you will have one global nation, requiring nationalism. With no nationalism, the nation would break back down into multiple nations. Tribal groups yearn to create their own rules, borders and destinies. This creates diversity of cultures on this Earth.

China and Vietnam have the communist legacy. Both have outlawed the use of cryptocurrencies as payment for goods.

When it comes to cryptocurrencies, America along with other countries with a strong capitalist European legacy have been much less oppressive. Thank goodness we have diversity of governments.
There are less environmental restrictions in Vietnam and China to my knowledge. I've spent months in China and visited Vietnam 3 times.

If one truly wants multiple cultures &gt; Bring back tribal stonings, spearing, scalping, gang rapes as punishment, beatings, sacrifices to dieties etc. Then we have multiculturalism. Tribal groups need their own lands. That is how culture survives.

ANZ pays women $500AUD extra per year. I never mentioned anything about getting paid weekly (where did I mention that? Quote me. oh!). You have already falsely accused me of lying.

ANZ is favouring the "weak" if anyone. ANZ is suggesting women need extra assistance and is giving it to them. ANZ's practice is similar to the 'diversity hire' situation, where I find myself looking at some employees and assuming they are possibly favoured as an employee because of their race and/or sex over their ability and talent.
With over 25 years in the workforce, I never dreamed a company would start paying one sex more than the other for exactly the same work. Stunning!

The ANZ policy pays women $500AUD per year extra. It goes into their retirement fund. If a man is working the EXACT same standard job and providing the exact same outcome for ANZ, he gets $500AUD less than a woman performing the EXACT same job.


1) Please quote what I have claimed that is intellectually dishonest.
2) Where are these businesses that pay men more than women for EXACTLY the same work? Please name the companies.
3) I have never encountered a work place in Australia or New Zealand that pays a woman and men at different rates for the EXACT same role. If I had ever come across such a situation I would have been shocked and appalled. I was astonished at ANZ's sexist stance.
