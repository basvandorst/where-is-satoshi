That's true of US$, but US$ is unusual in this respect
In most countries they introduce new notes (bills) from time to time, as anti-counterfeiting measures improve, and when they do that the old notes are withdrawn from circulation.
If you gave me a £50 note from 1980, I wouldn't be able to spend it.  I would, however, be able to send it to the Bank of England to exchange it for a current £50 note (which I would then be able to spend, of course).

Yes, this.
As I've said many times, miners are free to charge what they wish. It's quite possible - perhaps even likely - that miners will offer a smaller fee discount than 75% on witness data.
EDIT: Intersting aside: if miners choose to independently set the fee per byte for block data and witness data then this will make fee estimateion substantially more difficult.  If miners make full use of their freedom in fee-setting (and if different miners make substantially different decisions) this problem could significantly impact the development of an efficient fee market in the event of full blocks.

Electrum supports it - and it works with Trezor or Ledger.  They just don't let you create a *non-hardware* one yourself - at least not easily.
There is a workaround, but it's horrible:  create a BIP39 mnemonic using some other tool, then import it into Electrum, and **manually** specify a derivation path of m/49'/0'/0'.  Electrum will notice you're using a BIP49 derivation path and enable the P2WPKH-in-P2SH form of segwit.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'scalar' here.  But I think we're in agreement that we don't want to start hitting persistently full blocks.
My feeling is that setting out an agressive 20 year plan for blocksize increase, even if well intentioned, was always going to be controversial.
The way I see it is that we will make conservative hard forks every few years.  This keeps humans in the loop, and reassures those who are concerned about the risks of runnaway increases in block size.

Is there any evidence that Gavin disagreed with the approach adopted, though?  BIP101 is his baby - to call schenanigans you'd need to convince me that this was done against Gavin's wishes.  For all I know Gavin *wanted* to do it this way...
I don't think BIP65 is controversial, and I'm not aware that Gavin or Mike is against it.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:55:50
The real problem is that BIP101 tried to (kind of) use version bits - although I don't really understand why they picked 0x20000007 (maybe it makes sense read in the context of an earlier version bits proposal?)
The core developers could have chosen a version bit for BIP65, but they decided that version bits wasn't ready for deployment yet, so did it the old way - incrementing the version number to 4.
I'm perfectly happy that the core developers chose to be conservative here, rather than rush version bits out.  Version bits is important, so it needs to be right.
The current situation with the nVersion field is a bit of a mess, and there is no good solution.  The point of version bits is to fix this kind of mess.

It's difficult to tell what the community thinks, given the amount of confusion between opt-in and unconditional RBF in the 'debate'.
@_date: 2015-12-23 00:02:25
It's more about governance than expertese.  And to a lesser extent communication.  I'm sure that Core could get its act together, but will it?
The outrage about RBF by a large number of people who misunderstood what had been merged is a good example.  Why the hell weren't the plans being clearly communciated rather than people having to draw (often incorrect) conclusions from github?
The answer, AFAICT, is because far too often there are no clear plans to communicate.
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:01:16
But the exponential increase is one of the things that is scares some people off BIP101.   A linear increase like this is a much more conservative approach that should give us adequate block space in the medium term without allowing the scary (to some) exponential growth that is one of things that made BIP101 controversial.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:02:42
XT is not planned software.  It is an implementation of a Bitcoin node that exists now.
@_date: 2015-12-18 19:56:08
+1 for linear growth as a compromise.  This grows at 1MB per year, so it avoids those scary multi-gigabyte blocks that BIP101 will eventually allow.
But I'd really prefer the growth to be 20 bytes per block rather than 20 bytes per 10 minutes - it's much simpler for miners, since once the fork activates the block size limit becomes a simple function of block height.
@_date: 2015-12-15 21:31:11
You're right, I was confused.  But there is no ideal way to do this without version bits (which isn't deployed yet).  You want to be able indicate BIP65 support and BIP101 support independently, and as the two BIPs stand you can't.
AIUI the solution adpoted takes BIP101 support as also implying a BIP65 support.  Taking nVersion=0x2000007 as indicating that the miner did *not* support BIP65 would surely be worse as once we hit 95% adoption for BIP65 it would render all BIP101 blocks invalid.
I guess what you want is to regard nVersion=0x2000007 as a vote against BIP65 for the purposes of triggering, but to still enforce OP_CTLV transactions in BIP101 blocks - but only once BIP65 hits 95%?  That risks a lot of confusion as to whether BIP65 rules should be enforced for version 0x20000007 blocks at various points in BIP65 deployment.
I'm not sure I see the advantage, particularly if Mike and Gavin *wanted* to support BIP65 anyway - the solution adopted is much simpler - and therefore much less likely to result in implementation bugs.
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:39:46
Because the idea of hard forking to a much higher limit than we need - on the grounds that we could always soft fork lower again if it was felt desirable - is clearly not going to get consensus.
@_date: 2015-12-22 20:27:45
Core is definitely the most productive team, but it lacks any organisation behind it that is capable of setting policy and engaging with users.
Rather than having Core decide what it was doing and then clearly communicating its plans to users, we had a year of institutional paralysis, and even when core does make decisions it fails to communicate them.

Because small changes in the paramters can result in huge changes in the outcome?
The point isn't to say that block growth shouldn't be exponential - it's to say that setting that exponential growth into motion with a 20 year plan and then just stepping back is too dangerous.
I much prefer the idea of keeping humans in the loop - the question remains as to whether we'll be able to make regular decisions without the kind of uproar that this one is causing.
@_date: 2015-06-14 09:56:35
Yeah.  You probably can't win a war with less than 50% of the hash power, but more to the point, why would you want to?  If you succeeded, you'd just have created a coin that was eminently 51%-able.

For small amounts you might consider using an ATM, if you're close to one.  The fees are often quite high (5% is typical) but since it's a percentage it will still work out cheaper for small buys than paying for a SEPA transfer or wire transfer to an exchange

Just guessing, based on skimming some of Peter's posts, but perhaps the problem arises in the future should BIP101 actually gain a supermajority?  In which case an SPV client wouldn't be able to tell whether the block was mined by a BIP65 miner, creating a risk of believing a block mined by the original XT client (supporting BIP101 but not BIP65).  So a non-BIP65 block on the BIP101 chain (which would at that point be the longest chain).  Of course, the non-BIP65 block would be invalid, and rapidly orphaned, but the SPV client wouldn't know that.
EDIT: I'm not thinking straight.  The above applies even if BIP101 never triggers: an SPV client still wants to know whether a BIP101 miner implemented BIP65 or not
Just guessing - would love to know if that's the true reason.

Doubling every two years for twenty years?  That's ten doublings from 8MB which would take us to 8GB blocks!
I'm sorry, but committing now to 8GB blocks is just insane.  It is neither possible nor sensible to try to extrapolate the non-law known as Nielsen's Law that far out.
EDIT: If you want a framework that will last us for twenty years, then it needs to be something like BIP100 (i.e. something with human input) rather than lighting the blue touch paper on an exponential and just trusting that you got it right.
EDIT: To be fair, maybe we shouldn't worry _too_ much about setting the long-term block size too high, though.  We can always reduce it again if there's consensus.  Remember, reducing block size is a soft fork, so relatively safe and easy.  Similarly, cancelling scheduled block size increases is a soft fork.

If a universal quantum computer turns out to be feasible, and if it is eventually built, then it will result in pretty much all currently used public key crypto (including ECDSA) being compromised.  At that point we may be glad that the public keys are obscured in this way until we figure out how to transition Bitcoin to post-quantum cryptography.  That's a long way off, though, if it's even possible.
So yes, at the moment the only benefit is to save space (and AIUI that appears to  have been Satoshi's sole intention).

+2.1✕10^7 (because +1 just isn't emphatic enough :)
I like this proposal a lot because it gets to the crux of the problem, which is the inability to see far enough into the future.  Any attempt to decide now what Bitcoin will need many years into the future is fraught with difficulty - which I think is a big part of why consensus has been so hard to achieve.  So a mechanism for allowing those decisions to be deferred until they need to be made is definitely the way to go.

A cartel of &gt;50% of miners can always force a softfork (such as limiting block size) and not only would defection be disadvantageous, but there would be strong incentives for miners outside the cartel to start enforcing the softfork rules.
EDIT: I'd never really thought about it in these terms before, but given that soft forks are easy, why the hell are we arguing so much about this hard fork?  Reverting it would be a soft fork, meaning it would be (relatively) easy to go back to a 1MB cap if the community at large decided that was the best course of action.

You don't understand how the consensus code works.  Every node has to agree on the result of evaluating the scripts in the transaction, otherwise you'll get a fork.

Yes, with Bitcoin Core (also known as Bitcoin Qt) you need to make regular backups.
For privacy reasons you're generally encouraged to make new receiving addresses every time you ask someone to send you bitcoins - but even if you don't do that, Bitcoin Core will normally need to create a 'change address' every time you send bitcoins.
The software always keeps 100 new, unused addresses to hand, so you don't need to backup *every* time you do something that creates a new address - but you should back up regularly - and an absolute maximum of 100 transactions between backups would be a good rule of thumb.

There are quite a few Robocoins out there that have had the General Bytes retrofit applied.  It's a new General Bytes computer system you install internally, but you reuse the Robocoin housing, display, note acceptor, note dispensor, etc.  Ends up being functionally equivalent to a General Bytes ATM.
EDIT: Of course, the acceptor and dispensor in the Robocoin (as in all ATMs) are off the shelf.  AFAICT basically the only bit of the Robocoin that you end up reusing that *isn't* a third-party peripheral is the box the whole thing is installed in :-)

Makes a lot of sense, I think.  In particular, what they *didn't* do was offer a software solution that ran on the existing Robocoin computer hadware.  This way, the platform is much closer to the standard General Bytes ATM from a support point of view.

It depends on the wallet.
With Bitcoin Core, you need to make regular backups (at least every 100 transactions).  With some other wallets often a single backup will last you forever if you're not doing anything complicated.
If you tell us what wallet you're using I'm sure there are many here who can give you a precise answer for that particular wallet.

Prestel was V.23 IIRC. **TL;DR: Read the bit in bold**
V.23 was designed as a standard for a 1200 baud half-duplex modem (i.e. could only send in one direction at a time) with a 75 baud back channel (a simultaneous slow secondary channel that worked in the reverse direction, and which wasn't really _intended_ for carrying data, but more for line turnaround protocols - i.e. for the receiving station to request that it wants to now become the transmitting station).  Modern echo cancelling techniques didn't exist at the time, so full-duplex modems had to carve up the frequency spectrum into two distinct channels, and were limited to 300 baud, or a quarter of the speed of V.23.
Prestel realised that 75 baud was _just about_ fast enough to carry a user's typing, so they used the back channel as an actual data channel, allowing V.23 to be used as an asymmetric full-duplex modem, with 1200 baud down and 75 baud up.
Autodialers existed, but they were expensive, and manual dialing (as shown in the broadcast) was the norm for home users.  So home modems were actually essentially analogue devices;  without the need to handle dialing, or the need to implement line turnaround, these modems were quite simply just turning voltages on the RS232 line into tones on the phone line - and back again.
Back then what a modem did was simply FSK modulate a carrier directly from the RS232 serial line - complete with start and stop bits - so 1 character per second corresponds to 10 baud (1 start bit + 7 data bits + 1 parity bit + 1 stop bit, or alternatively 8 data bits and no parity).  So you divide by 10 to get characters per second - so 120 characters per second down and 7.5 characters per second up.  Taking characters as equivalent to bytes that gives you **120 bytes per second down and 7.5 bytes per second up!** (although arguably when using 7 data bits with parity it's really equivalent to 105 bytes per second down and 6.5 bytes per second up).  At these speeds a typical videotex-format page (24 lines of 40 characters each) could take up to 8 seconds to load!
Also, there was no error correction - parity sometimes provided rudimentary error _detection_ - so line noise could (and frequently did) result in lost or corrupted characters in either the display or the keyboard input.
Also interesting to note, the equivalent US standard - Bell 202 - used a 5 baud back channel.  Just about adequate for a simple line turnaround protocol, but at 0.5 bytes per second, way too slow for this hack to have been usable in the US.
The Prestel hack (i.e. 1200/75 baud full duplex) became quite commonplace for BBSs in the UK (and quite probably in the rest of Europe, although I don't know).

The network supporting segwit is not the same thing as the majority of wallets supporting segwit - and network support (i.e. node and miner support) gains us nothing in itself.

That's not what's meant by a _settlement network_, though.  A settlement network is one used to settle netted out transaction values _between financial institutions_ (who themselves settle end user transactions).
EDIT: Ok, so in the Bitcoin world that might mean managing payment channels between Lightning nodes - which aren't (necessarily) financial institutions.  But the point remains that a settlement network is a back office network that is used behind the scenes to make end-user financial services work - but it is a network that pretty much by defintion does not provide direct end-user financial services.
EDIT^2: This isn't necessarily an absolute (and in the Bitcoin network is unlikely to be so).  So it's perfectly possible that the Bitcoin network ends up _primarily_ being used to manage Lightning payment channels but continues to be used by directly by a small number of end-users for very high value transactions.

Given that pools are well connected to each other via private peerings and the relay network, and also well connected to the P2P network, it's not readily apparent to me that either the 8 or the 30s are appropriate for calculating the minimum acceptable bandwidth for a non-mining full node.

Am I right in thinking segwit can't be safely used until it hits 95%?  At 75% old blocks are still valid so if someone attempts to claim the pay-to-anyone tx they are likely to succeed (as their attempt will eventually be mined by one of the non-upgraded miners)

@_date: 2016-06-15 23:33:00
Huh?  You can't use segwit to somehow get a 'discount' on sending to a traditional P2SH address; such a transaction will have no witness data and hence it's not a segwit tx (and it will have no discount).
It's true that P2WPKH and P2WSH can both be nested in P2SH, and that the address in that case begins with '3' just like any other P2SH address, but that's about as far as the similarity goes.

Wouldn't Unicode regard these variations as a font issue?  I would have thought that the Unicode approach would be to just define a BITCOIN SIGN and not concern itself with the fact that there might be variations in the appearance of the glyph.
EDIT: Thinking about this a bit more it's pretty clear that whether you use a double line or single line - and whether the line(s) go through the character, or merely protrude from the top and bottom of the character - are just stylistic issues.  The dollar sign can be written in all these ways (do a Google image search for dollar sign) and yet we don't have a problem agreeing that it's still DOLLAR SIGN regardless of which way it is written.
I don't think the fact that a (relatively rare) stylistic variant of the bitcoin sign is visually identical to the common represetation of the Thai bhat sign should be a problem - it seems fairly clear that THAI CURRENCY SIGN BHAT is the wrong thing to use when talking about bitcoins so I would hope this shouldn't prevent the proposal from progressing.
I'm somewhat unsure whether the form of the bitcoin sign with the stroke to the lower left should be considered to be the same character or not.  Of course, the proponents of this form want to use the ready made LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B WITH STROKE - they chose the symbol precisely because the code point already exists - but I still think it's the same character.
Assume we get BITCOIN SIGN included in Unicode, and imagine that at some point in the future, a different form of the bitcoin sign becomes more popular, then the reality is that font designers would almost inevitable start to code the new, more popular glyph at the BITCOIN SIGN codepoint, whether that be the b-with-stroke version or some future stylistic variation that's yet to be devised.

As long as the validating fork wins, then usual softfork behaviour applies, and there's a strong incentive for miners on the wrong side of the softfork to upgrade.  But I agree we would want more headroom than that.
Ok, let's be a bit more conservative.  Say we want 60% of blocks being built on validated blocks, and we want this to remain the case even if block download/validation times increase by 20% (e.g due to Internet links in some parts of the world becoming more heavily loaded).

Someone selling goods and services are, unless there is any provision to the contrary, allowed to choose who they transact with and under what terms.
So if they enter into the contract on the stated basis of payment by some other means than cash you're on pretty shaky ground to claim that a debt has been inurred which you can settle in cash.  Truth is, you violated the terms of the contract by refusing to pay in the agreed way, and they can just declare the sale null and void and walk away.

Which means this isn't an argument against (modest) block size increases.
It can, however, be used to set an upper bound on safe block size, assuming that rational miners will always apply this strategy.
Essentially, the average time (weighted by hashrate) for a miner to download and validate a block needs to be less than about 7 minutes (10ln2 minutes) since that corresponds to a 50% probability of having found a block.
As long as miners are downloading and validating blocks quicker than that, &gt;50% of blocks will be built on top of an already-validated block.
EDIT: Actually, "average time weighted by hashrate" isn't quite right - it's the probabilities of building on an unvalidated block you need to be averaging, not the times themselves.  In practice though you'd probably want to simply ensure that all major miners are able to download and verify in comfortably less than 7 minutes.

There certainly are countries which have the death penalty for drugs offenses but I'm going to hazard a guess that you're from the US and as far as I'm aware the US doesn't have such a penalty at either the federal level or in any state.

Ok, I'll give him one brainfade so let's move on to the next.  I'm not an expert in radio, but I'm pretty sure that railway lines don't work well as antennae, at least in the shortwave bands. You've got a horizontal conductor a negligible distance (in terms of wavelength) from the groundplane (which is the, well, ground).  How's that going to work?
Ok, let's ignore the railway line and go with the razor wire on fenceposts which is at least a plausible antenna, assuming concrete or wooden fenceposts (metal fenceposts really aren't going to work that well).  Yes, radio hams do communicate with each other over a distance of 1,000 miles, but they also put quite a lot of work into their antennae. I'd love to hear from an actual radio ham just how plausible this setup is.  My guess is "not" but I'll reserve judgement for now.  (Remember, also, the transmitter has to be portable.  I'll take as a given it's something luggable powered by a car battery rather than a matchbox-sized device powered by USB from the laptop.  But even so, I'm not convinced it's entirely realisitic.)
But even if it works, presumably you'd have to be using a well-known frequency (or chip sequence, or whatever) which could relatively easily be jammed.  Yes, information wants to be free, but your examples suck.

Unfotunately it's complicated to implement.  It can be done, and it's called FSS-RBF, but it's complciated by the fact that in Bitcoin you can't tell the difference between the payment and the change.
So you can't reduce _any_ output of the tx - i.e. you can't just increase the fee by accepting less change.

Ok, so you envisage a world with multiple independently operated instances of the relay network?  Sure, that would at least help with availability - although I had understood there was a desire to retire the relay network.  (EDIT: But surely connecting to multiple relay networks would eat into the efficiency gains that you claim it has over xtreme thin blocks - so maybe I'm misunderstanding your point?)
But let me rephrase my question: do you know if it would be possible to implement the relay protocol in the P2P network, with no reliance on other servers (i.e everything done in the Bitcoin node)?  Efficiency aside, it's still an interesting question because a bitcoin network that relies only on nodes and a bitcoin network that requires nodes plus additional relay servers are architecturally different.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:39:50
Agreed.  If the object is a fee market where transactions regularly have to have their fees adjusted then CPFP would be wasteful to the extreme.
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:43:48
But the relay network, in it's current form, relies on central servers, and AIUI it has on occasion had downtime.  I'm sure all major miners/pools do use it _when it's available_ - but during relay network outages they have to rely the normal P2P protocol (albeit no doubt in many cases with direct peerings between miners/pools).
Is the current relay protocol amenable to a fully decentralised implementation?  (Genuine question: I'm not familliar with the details of the protocol.)

(Sorry for the belated reply)
It depends on what you mean by a quantum computer.  Obviously it's not how a quantum annealing computer works (which D-Wave may or may not be able to make).  But a universal quantum computer (aka a quantum turning machine) is a proposed class of quantum computer that can solve a class of problems in a complexity class called BQP in polynomial time (to a bounded degree of error).
No one knows for sure whether such a machiine is actually possible, of course, at least on any scale that is useful, but many people believe that at least it might be.
We're not talking about brute force attacks here.  As I udnerstand it (and I'm no expert in this area) the eliptic curve discrete log problem (on which ECDSA relies) just happens to be soluable in BQP but not, as far as we know, in P (or BPP) - meaning it can't be solved in polynomial time on a conventional computer but **can** be solved in polynomial time on a universal *quantum* computer.
The reason this is important is this: *if* we can build a quantum computer that solve real-world-sized problems in BQP in polynomial time, and *if* such a computer ever gets fast enough to break practical ECDSA, we may very well have a big problem: we can't anywhere near as easily just increase key size to fix the problem, as we have over the years with RSA and DSA (and an assumption that our adversary doesn't have a quantum computer).  Because that fix relies on the fact that increasing the key size hurts the attacker far more than the user.  If we ever find an attack in polynomial time, then that margin is, at best, eroded significantly.  Public key crypto can currently be performed on typical low end consumer hardware with keysizes that are proof against even the most well-funded opponent - and that's what quantum computers threaten to change.
Note, this isn't fundamental to pubic key crypto - it just happens that factorization and the discrete log problem have solutions in BQP.  We continue to use them because they are well studied, have relatively small key sizes, and no one really believes that a universal quantum computer is imminent.
But there are other public key cryptosystems which can't be broken in BQP - they're just not widely used atm.  This field of study is sometimes called post-quantum cryptography.

Potentially.  It's not intrinsically clear whether CFPF is being appled to the recipient's output or the change output - although you may be able to infer from context.
RBF has a similar problem, though.  By increasing the fee and reducing (or replacing) the change output you again identify which output is the recipient and which is change.

I haven't seen a £50 note in years.  You used to sometimes get them when you withdrew cash at the bank counter, but who does that anymore?
ATMs in the UK generally only give out £20 and £10 notes, and of course you're not going to get a £50 pound note in your change, since it's the highest value note in circulation, in England at least (I think one of the Scottish banks used to print £100 pound notes - don't know if they still do).
I'd be curious to know who actually uses £50 notes these days.  Even back when they were in more widespread circulation, many shops wouldn't accept them.

Right.  So basically if you're a PayPal merchant and you say the following on your site you'll probably find you're not a PayPal merchant for much longer: "We suggest you don't use Paypal.  We really don't like it.  We only support Paypal because some of our customers insist on paying that way."
Try accepting Bitcoin through a processor like Bitpay or Coinbase and see how long you survive if you put up a message rubishing them.
Use them, don't use them, you have a choice.  And payment processors also have a choice as to which merchants they do business with.  It's basic business commonsense that you don't publicly disparage the companies you do business with (at least if you want to carry on doing business with them).

I don't think there's as much contradiction around the 'bankruptcy' as you think there is.
Bankruptcy does not mean simply running out of money.  Bankruptcy is a particular legal status in insolvency proceedings in certain jurisdictions.  The way you become bankrupt is by filing for bankruptcy.  I believe the Foundation when they say “The Foundation is not bankrupt nor have there been any discussions regarding a potential bankruptcy.”  I think it is clear they are not bankrupt (i.e. I'm pretty sure they have not filed for bankruptcy) because if they were I'm pretty sure we would know it.  I also believe them when they say they have not discussed filing for bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy is one form of proceedings in certain jurisdictions that is used when an organisation is insolvent.  But, insolvent doesn't simply mean running out of money, either.  Insolvent means that you are unable to pay your debts.  It seems that the Foundation believes it is not insolvent - probably mainly because it doesn't have many debts.  Instead, it seems likely that the Foundation is simply running out of money and will therefore have to stop spending money.
That is not bankruptcy.  That is not insolvency.  That is simply running out of money.  It is perfectly possible for an organization that runs out of money to wind itself up in a responsible manor, without ever being insolvent (i.e. without incurring debts it can't pay back).  It happens all the time.
The fact that one of the directors hyperbolicaly used those words to emphasise the lack of money doesn't mean that the foundation is actually insolvent or bankrupt (although of course it _might_ be insolvent).  But probably it just means it's run out of money.

I believe Andreas Schildbach has experimented with transfering a BIP70 payment message (which contains signed transactions) over Bluetooth and even in QR codes, precisely to support this use case.
Unfortunately this is all experimental, non-standard stuff - the usual ways of using BIP70 still require an Internet connection.  There is some experimental code in Andreas's Bitcoin Wallet for Android, but AFAIK this scheme isn't interoperable with anything else atm.
So in the future, it's likely this will be possible, but at the moment your best (and probably only) bet is to provide wi-fi to your customers, I think.

By convention, names of currencies are never capitalized in English.  Most people advocate following this convention when talking about Bitcoin, too.  But when talking about Bitcoin as a technology, a network, etc, it's quite reasonable (and common practice)right and proper to capitalise it.
So it's 'bitcoin' when talking about the currency and only 'Bitcoin' when talking about the system as a whole.
So should definitely be 'bitcoin sign' with a small 'b' (unless at the beginning of a sentence) since this is a sign for the unit of currency rather than a sign for the Bitcoin network.

I think 80th percentile is too high a bar for block size reductions, given &gt;50% can always force a soft fork to permanently reduce the block size, and then we'd have to go through the whole hard fork argument if we want to increase it again.

Here in the UK banks all major banks pretty much pulled out of the safe deposit box business years ago.  They decided long ago that they are no longer in the business of running big vaults, at least at branch level.
Independent safe deposit box providers still exist (and by all accounts business is booming) and if you're in London you have a choice of multiple companies offering this service.   Outside London, you'll be luck to find anything, although a few big cities (by no means all) do have a company providing the service.

You are right though, I think, and it is a good point.  A majority of miners could invalidate blocks with votes they don't like.  That could be an argument for just using the median vote in all cases - for increase and decrease
EDIT: I think there is a qualitative difference, though.  A softfork to invalidate blocks just because they contain votes you don't like would cause a massive community backlash.  A softfork to reduce the 32MB BIP100 cap would be far more likely to be seen as a legitimate proposal.  After all, soft forks are perceived to be the normal, legitimate (and outside of BIP100, only) way of reducing block size.  e.g. if we adopt BIP101 and then later want to halt future increases or even reduce the block size, a soft fork would be the way we'd do it.

No, the sophistry is in the original post.
What the OP is doing is taking something that was said in a board meeting and (at least potentially) misinterpreting it to draw conclusions that (while in no way impossible) are not in any clear cut way born out by what was said.
A board meeting is a meeting of human beings.  They express opinions.  They disagree.  They even have arguments and they even make mistakes.  After a discussion, particularly a heated one, it's not unusual for people at the meeting to come away with slightly different understandings of what people's positions were.
I'm sure this is *exactly* why so many people in real organisations are opposed to full transparency - it's because trolls will analyse every word that was said.  Transparency turns board meetings into the equivalent of bitcointalk or this sub.  You can't just say what you think because if you express the half-formed idea as it comes into your head, then you know you'll be torn to pieces by Internet trolls as soon as the minutes are published.  So it's safer just to not participate in the meeting at all.  And, of course, that's incredibly counterproductive for the organisation.
[Edited for clarity]
EDITED TO ADD: And of course, the reality is that if you were in a meeting where your every word would be trolled, what would you do?  You'd just spend *more* time having informal chats with the other board members so you could try and reach some kind of concensus *before* you ever start the board meeting.  Because everything you say in the board meeting risks being analysed and misinterpreted.  Result: move all the *real* decision-making out of the board meeting and actually _reduce_ transparency.

The comparison is with domestic euro transfers, not with domestic local currency transfers.  As long as they don't charge more for a SEPA transfer than a domestic euro transfer, they're fine.
Most UK banks offer consumers domestic _sterling_ transfers for free, but domestic euro transfers are a speciality service (since the euro isn't our domestic currency and very few people here would have a euro bank account or want to use euros for a domestic transfer anyway).  So there's little demand for euro transfers from consumers (as opposed to businesses) and the market pressure to offer them for free just isn't there in the UK (at the moment, at least).

Bitcoins are fungible - that is they are, de facto, traded without regard to the identity or provenance of particular UTXOs.
What you are saying is that the design of Bitcoin can't guarantee that this will always remain the case - but it surely is currently the case.
Pork bellies are fungible on the commodities market.  There's nothing about the nature of pork bellies that guarantees this - pigs have DNA so society could choose to threaten the fungibility of pork bellies.  But they happen to be currently traded as a fungible commodity.  As is (currently) Bitcoin.
You can claim that Bitcoin is not fungible but only by redefining fungibility so narrowly that, AFAICS, nothing in existence is fungible.  What you seek may well be a useful goal, but please choose a new term for it - calling it 'fungibility' is confusing.

What, so if Euro notes are stolen in a bank robbery, and the serial numbers of the stolen banknotes are known - you assert that the authorities cannot act if they find stolen notes?  This seems implausible.
It _is_ the case that most jurisdictions will not act against someone who unknowingly, through no fault of their own, is in possession of a stolen banknote - and this is indeed a deliberate policy to maintain fungibility.
But the authorities can and will confiscate the cash and lock you in jail if you were a party to the bank robbery.

I'm not sure I believe it.  If it had activated with a miner minority, then it would have been easy for someone to force a chain split (which clearly didn't happen).
BIP16 stated it requried 55% miner support before it wuldl be activated and AIUI the flag day wasn't set until they had achieved 55%.
Yes, it was controviersial, but in the end I'm pretty sure it activated _with_ miner support.  But it was a long time ago - not sure I remember the detail too clearly now.

What?  The Gmail money transfer is not new technology, it's just a layer on top of the same old legacy bank transfer system.
I'm just commenting that in the UK there wouldn't appear to be a huge market for this service because the legacy bank transfer system is actually pretty accessible and usable already over here.  (And those people who insist on using email addresses to initiate legacy money transfers are pretty much all using Paypal already.)
In the US, as I understand it, direct access to the legacy bank transfer system is not available to private individuals.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that most Americans can just log in to their bank account with a web browser and initiate an ACH transfer to anyone in the country at the click of a button.  Hence the market for these services in the US.

Ah, the other side of this is that the merchant really, really needs to have an Internet connection anyway.  There's no solution to accepting bitcoin without an Internet connection and there never wil be - without access to the blockchain, you wouldn't be able to validate transactions at all.  One day we might be able to get away without the customer needing Internet connectivity, but the merchant will always need it.
Given you need Internet in order to _accept_ Bitcoin it's usually not much extra effort to make it available to your customers, too.
Of course, your use case might be a bit of an exception, if your Internet connection is low bandwidth and/or you pay for data (e.g a satellite Internet link).

EDIT: Cut-and-paste error - I quoted the wrong para of your post.  Now fixed.


Problem with that is, if I were Satoshi - or indeed if I were anyone with multi-million-dollar long-term holdings of bitoin - I'd have the keys split into multiple portions using Shamir secret sharing and split between multiple safe deposit boxes in different cities (or even different countries).  I'd want it to be as hard as possible for me to access those keys at short notice, in order to provide me with a level of protection from being forced to move the coins at gunpoint.

I've always thought that ASICs are one of the things that gives Bitcoin its security, and hence its dominant status and resulting value.
Right now substantially all the hardware on this planet that is capable of usefully mining Bitcoin is already mining Bitcoin.  That's not true of any other blockchain, and it won't be true after a PoW fork.

The problem with that logic is that, _at worst_, any or all committers _might_ be acting to undermine bitcoin.  I'm not saying there's evidence of that (as far as I'm aware there isn't), but we can't disprove it since we don't know what their hypothetical malicious plans might be.
So, by extension, all committers should have their commit bit revoked until they all _prove_ themselves to be trustworthy, not just beyond reasonable doubt, but to a mathematical certainty.  Which is, of course, impossible to do.
EDIT: Since I'm being downvoted here - I'd like to clarify: I'm just demonstrating here, _reductio ad absurdum_, that considering the absolute worst possible case isn't helpful.  You need to consider what's plausible.
In a formal risk assessment, you weight every possible adverse scenario by estimates of both how much damage it would cause if it came to pass and also how likely it is to come to pass; worst cases scenarios considered in isolation don't tell you much;  you can almost always construct an incredible damaging but incredibly unlikely "worst case" - and focussing a disproportionate amount of effort on an extremely unlikely "worst case" does not generally result in an effective approach to managing risk.
I fully accept, though, that intelligent people can disagree as to how likely different scenarios are.  Just saying that it requires more analysis than just an exhortation to "consider the worst case".

It sounds like EUR-denominated withdrawals can currently only be processed if they are to banks within the EU, due to intermediary banks refusing to handle the transfers.

Well, clearly a grocery store could do that.  Maybe in certain jurisdictions a grocery store is not permitted to do that, but they clearly _could_ do that.
In order to prevent this attack on the fungibility of banknotes, it would be necessary to remove serial numbers from the notes.

~~I never thought about it at the time - but that message could be interpreted to mean that there were several people behind the Satoshi name (which has oft been speculated).~~
~~i.e. "we (the members of the original Bitcoin team) are all Satoshi"~~
Working theory: Wright, Kleiman and Finney (and possibly others) were part of a team that used the Satoshi pseudonym - they are all Satoshi.  If Wright were the only surviving member of the Satoshis, maybe he would feel that to justify his claims that he *is* Satoshi.  ~~But, in my interpretation, "We are all Satoshi" would imply it was from one of the other Satoshis - implying there is still at least one other surviving Satoshi in addition to Wright.~~
EDIT: nm, I should have remembered that the message had been debunked.  Looking at the message headers it is pretty unambiguously a forgery.  I still think it's possible Craig Wright was one of the people behind the Satoshi identity.  I rather suspect that he may be overstating his role, though, now there's no one left to contradict him.

There are very few miners who earn only a small return over their electricity costs, for the simple reason that such miners would be making a loss overall once hardware costs are factored.
Of course, this might prompt miners to switch off some of their older kit, but in the main miners need to be getting a substantial return over the electricity costs in order to fund the frequent hardware upgrades needed to keep up with increasing difficulty.

Bitcoin mining hardware is generally priced at what the manufacturers think the market can stand, based on ROI.
Back then, most people were mining on hardware that had been priced to ROI at a much lower price point.  Of course, difficulty was going up rapidly too, but not as quickly as price.
So those people who bought miners when the price was low did very well for a brief time.  (Of course, they'd have done just as well, if not better, by buying coins when the price was low, but that's just the way it goes.)

Armory is still maintained.  The new maintainer is goatpig - who has actually been the de facto maintainer for quite a long time.
Disclaimer: I haven't used 0.94 yet - I'm still running 0.93.  But since you can still uses the old 0.92/0.93 version for the offline node - indeed there is no 0.94 offline component yet - there would seem to be no risk here - at least for cold storage use cases.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:40:24
Why would you say that it's 'iffy'?
Remember that by design the offline node doesn't need to trust the online component - the whole point of solutions like Armory is to protect you from a compromised online system.  And goatpig recommends that you continue to use etotheipi's 0.92 or 0.93 release on your offline node.  So you don't need to actually trust the new goatpig releases just yet, as long as you carefully verify the transaction information displayed by the offline node prior to signing (as you always should).
etotheipi used to recommend this approach too: be conservative with upgrades to the offline node.  The trustless nature of it protects you not only from compromise of your online system, but also from bugs in the Armory running on the online system.
EDIT: Of course, if you're using Armory for online wallets too, then you do need to trust goatpig's code.  A wallet bug could theoretically result in coin loss for online wallets.  Historically coin loss wallet bugs have been pretty damn rare, though (and I'm speaking about wallets in general, rather then specifically Armory).  Of course, there will undoubtedly come a point further down the line where new features will necessitate breaking compatibility with the old offline code, and you'll need to upgrade your offline node - this happened at least once under etotheipi, too.  But for now, it's not an issue.

I take your point.  My feeling is that miners are busy upgrading to 16nm technology, and therefore probably ditching older miners simply because they don't have enough space/power/cooling in their facility to keep them running.  So the proportion of miners that will be underwater post-halvening might really be quite small.
But you're right, you might imagine they still have enough of these running that you should see _some_ effect on the hash rate.  The reality is that it's too early to tell - you need more than a day's worth of blocks to get a good idea of the hash rate.  Maybe there has been a significant drop, and we just haven't really seen it on the graphs yet.
It's also _possible_ that some large miners are keeping loss-making equipment running for now because they judge that a hash rate drop would reduce confidence in Bitcoin, and that it's in their interests to avoid that.  If they switch it off gradually over a period of a few weeks - indeed, they may have started doing that pre-halvening - then it will be masked by the general rise in difficulty due to adoption of 16nm technology...

It's a bit of a myth that SEPA transfers have to be free.  The actual rule is that a bank can't charge more for a SEPA transfer than it does for a EUR-denominated transfer between domestic bank accounts.
As a result SEPA transfers within the Eurozone are usually free (since in most countries domestic bank transfers are free, and they can't charge more).  But it's far from a universal truth.

Most people join a mining pool - which works just like a lottery syndicate - the pool claims the winnings and splits them amongst the members (in proportion to how fast their mining rigs are).
Any reasonable sized pool will solve several blocks per day on average, so members get pretty constant payouts, with very little element of luck.
That way you earn a few dollars every day rather than earning (probably) nothing, and gambling on the chance of winning a block and keeping the entire block reward.  Although some people do choose to do this, too.

This doesn't really have anything to do with Brexit, except perhaps that the downturn in commercial property can conveniently be blamed on it.
The problem is taking illiquid assets  - such as big office blocks, which take a very long time to buy or sell - and packaging them up into a mutual fund with the promise that investors can trade daily.
It was always going to end like this.
EDIT: A normal mutual fund, which typically owns shares and other similarly liquid investments - simply cashes thoses investments in when investors want their money back.  In a fund like this, they can't do that, obviousy, so they have to keep cash reserves on hand to fund withdrawals.  But obviously they're limited in how much cash they can keep on hand, because what the investors are paying for is to have their money invested in commercial property.  It was always a precarious setup.
