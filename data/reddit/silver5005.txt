because 10k was its biggest most talked about milestone and also when the daily news began to pick it up and discuss it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:20:45
you know how many people with weak stomachs who got in at the top are ready to sell sub 10k?  
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:51:02
It was worthless at 19k, which is why its 10k right now.  (:
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:06:20
Im short CME futures at 16k.  No hindsight here buddy just got sick of people bragging about "free money".
lmao @ buy at 19k tho, thats gold Jerry.
I love how its okay for the bulls to suck each others dicks every other day when its on the rise, but when it gets taken to the woodshed everyones gotta stay hush hush or scream HODL like some kind of retard.

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:26:18
which is why buying a bubble with the idea that theres a "greater fool" out there who will pay a higher price is a shitty investment strategy.  Anyone who bought past 10k deserved the loss imo.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:13:15
CME futures are backed by the SEC and they have never defaulted on a contract.  Theres no fucking way you can say the same thing for these ICO cash grab shady operations that you cant even access in times of market turmoil.
Seriously try to be less fucking stupid.
If you think silver or gold is easier to manipulate than the small market cap of crypto youre a fucking lunatic.  Theres popular reports that a single trader was responsable for bitcoins rise from 100 to 1000$.  Find me a commodity one person can move 1000% in regular markets.  Oh wait you cant.
In what world are listed futures the ponzi scheme and bitcoin is the sound investment?

@_date: 2019-07-30 17:36:07
It sounds like you're suggesting the driving mechanism behind price is cost of production instead of stock to flow.  Even if this is the case, then theoretically bitcoin should always rise over time because of its difficulty adjustment mechanism on the mining process.  More and more electricity cost every adjustment.  
The only argument for a decreasing bitcoin price at that point is we somehow find free energy.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:04:46

Thanks so much for the reply.  I listen to Andreas a lot and he spoke of the amount being an issue and zero knowledge proofs and similar concepts developed to fight that.
Hypothetically, would 10$ that's gone through 10 coinjoins be any harder to trace than 10$ that went through 1? In other words does the effect stack at all?

He gave you the best answer you will get.  If you cant do the math for the efficiency of your asic and the electricity cost in your area, discounted by the value of a reward block; then you dont need to be mining.
Simply googling "bitcoin mining profitability" in no way means you have the skills necessary to mine btc profitably
@_date: 2019-07-30 18:10:18
I agree 
I have a research paper looking into the correlation between price and cost of manufacturing and iirc they had an r-squared in the high 80s.
Bookedmarked on PC at home I'll link later.
Bitcoins difficulty adjustment mechanism is its secret sauce, not stock to flow or halvings.
edit: 
for those interested, this is a great read on finding bottoms in bear market corrections using mining break even (cost of production), not my research.  Best r2 metric ive found in the space.  And the furthest their model has been off was like 3x the predicted price in peak 2017 mania.  Most models are orders of magnitude off.

Because comparing btc to tulips is something only non informed talking heads on CNBC do in 2015.  Even the talking heads arent stupid enough to say that shit in 2019.
Tulip mania and all actual "bubbles" defining characteristic is the bubble pops one time and it's done forever.  Btc has been tested for 10 years and has had multiple "bubble pops" and yet it just keeps coming back.  This is very obviously something different.
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:45:22
Thanks.  I think people have a hard time believing that one day consumers may end up being paid to borrow.
Some how it makes sense to them Govt's can do it but they dont realize the only difference between governments borrowing and consumers borrowing is credit risk.  If we ever see -3.00% rates on govt bonds you best bet that mortgages will be at 0% or lower.
If fiat becomes toxic to a banks balance sheet to the extent of say -3% per year itd actually be profitable to lend the money out at -1% per year.

@_date: 2019-08-03 05:44:01
When you're doing the lending, yes.  Now think of it from the borrowers point of view.
When you lease a car at 10% APR that's a 10% tax for the priviledge of borrowing money.  What happens when that rate goes negative? You're being paid for borrowing. 
Consumer lending might not be at negative yet, but AAA corporations essentially have negative rates and consumer mortgages are barely at 2% for a 30 year.  Governments and corporations are being paid to borrow today, soon its consumers.

You wanna hear something fun?  I work at a fortune 100 bank that provides pensions for every non profit (school, i.e 403b plans) in North America.  To give you an idea of the size of our annuity products we pay out more than social security each year in fixed payments.  2nd biggest owner of real estate.  &gt;1 trillion assets in management.
We have a product named XYZ traditional which is a guranteed 3% interest rate, no matter what, no questions asked.  It can only be liquidated however over 9 years, because its in 'illiquid real estate for a higher yield'.
When learning about this product I asked how we gurantee a 3%, and I learned its currently done at a loss; subsidized through the profit of our annuities in which the beneficiery dies before the payout is made in full.  Any money not paid out benefits our companies general account which supports this unsustainable rate.
I asked what would happen if rates went negative in the US.  First I got laughed at, then I was informed our company would go out of business; but not to worry because that wont happen.
So ya, look forward to that.

US, pretty new customer.
@_date: 2019-08-03 07:25:17
That's one side of the trade.
You can also borrow money as a consumer, and as the cost of money decreases because the supply continually increases, it will drive the cost of not just government loans to negative but also corporate (which it already has) and then lastly consumer loans negative (which is next); in the order of their respective credit risks.
Both sides of the equation are true.  Maybe it was wrong to imply consumers were getting paid to borrow just yet.  But were certainly on the way.
Just look at the corporate rates (also negative) and mortgage rates (0 if you subtract inflation i.e real rate) and you'll see what I mean.

you joke but this is the business model for one of the largest banks in the US, fortune 100 with &gt;1 trillion assets in management.  We pay out more fixed payments than social security with our annuities.
Our core annuity gurantees 3% a year and can only be liquidated over 10 years for obvious reasons.

If you believe this is a sound way of investing; sure.
There are things you can buy/invest in however that have a tangible, countable value to them which arent made up of 100% speculation. (ex.  You can see the revenue brought in each quarter by a company you like.  Bitcoin has no fundamental underlying value, when you buy it you're just betting there will be someone else out there willing to pay a higher speculative price than you at a later date.)
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:29:03
I actually dont regret not playing it at all because it doesnt have listed options which are my forte.
It appeals to most of you people because you dont know what derivatives are or how to trade them so you like the volatility you get out of bitcoin.  I can achieve the same volatility with options on an underlying that isnt a speculative bubble, which im fine with.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:52
Yes; this is essentially the same for stocks except the borrowing cost for bitcoin is comparatively much much higher.  Then theres counterparty risk.  Thats why people dont short it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:24
Nice trade
@_date: 2019-06-08 02:57:43






how funny.  I was trying to explain this exact thing to my mom earlier today who I convinced to make her first crypto purchase.  Im 21 years old.  What are the chances some random reddit dude and a 21 year old who lives w his parents can understand this and the phds at the fed apparently "dont understand" where the inflation is.
Its so obvious they're blatantly aware of whats going on.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:44
Like I would "invest" in either ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:50:07
And multiple idiots in this sub tried arguing with me just yesterday that its not public yet.
When my moms asking how to buy bitcoin its definitely public.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:51:03
Katy Perry also wanted Warren Buffets take on the matter.  If you people think you're still in some niche area of the market that no one knows about... Lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:35
are you idiots actually specualting on litecoin on the basis that people like to own round numbers of stuff.  Jesus christ.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:30:55
It doesnt change the fact that there were people with bitcoin who were unable to sell or buy  during wild price fluctuations.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:37:19
I tried this but coinbase makes me wait literally like a month and a half to transfer cash (USD) to coinbase pro.  Says unavailable for withdraw.
BTC moves way too much to bother waiting to save on fees unless im missing something.

Find me another investment in history that has gone from a penny to 100,000 USD in 24 years, you'd be hard pressed to find one that even made it to 10,000.  Sure it could go on longer, and you might be able to sell it to someone else at higher prices; but that is by definition the "greater fools" theory.  I have no horse in this race either, I just think its amazing to see the madness of crowds in a real life modern day example.
"When acting in accordance with the greater fool theory, an investor buys questionable securities without any regard to their quality, but with the hope of quickly selling them off to another investor (the greater fool), who might also be hoping to flip them quickly. Unfortunately, speculative bubbles always burst eventually, leading to a rapid depreciation in share price due to the selloff."
Just a thought.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:36
Lets just think about this.  Its not unforseeable to see its value cut 60-80% in the event of an eventual correct.  To see that amount of profit on the upside youll have to see BTC trading at 16,000-18,000 a coin.  Good luck but it sounds like your only reason for buying is fear of missing out.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:52:43
Jesus and that doesnt worry you people.  Lol I can't wait for an actual down move.... good luck with that 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:59:58
The fact that you're not the only highschooler he's discussed this with is all the signs we need of a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:54:32
im saying that to my understanding, if you wanted to liquidate at the peak of activity today some weren't able to because the coin suppliers network infrastructure couldnt handle the traffic.  If you could and im wrong then thats great.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:30:48
I love how idiots here are actually arguing with that statement. 
Tell me again how this isn't exactly like the 99 dot.com bubble or the housing bubble.  You people are fucking nuts lmao.  Or you're 14 and you've never seen anything but a bull market and dont know how to read a book.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:24
You people are actually delusional from gains huh
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:33
Read a fuckin book jesus
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:28:58
Its much harder to short sell bitcoin than it is to buy it.  Which isnt the case in most listed markets.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:11:28
Can't access investment as price fluctuates 20%, rationalized somehow that it's a good thing.  You people are truly amazing ��
I can't wait as it heads to zero for everyone to flock to log in at once, unable to get out until sub 1000.  Have fun :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:42
this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:40:57
Sure thing.  So basically no one managing significant amounts of money wants to speculate in bitcoin because it carries something called counter party risk (you can read up on this on investopedia or something, but its basically your risk that the firm you do business with goes under)
So futures are cleared by this group called the CME Group, who back every transaction (i.e you dont have to worry the person you're trading with can't deliver on their requirements).  This eliminates a majority of the counter party risk.  
Also fees on futures are much much smaller as a % of the notional, with much more leverage for actual speculation and liquidity 24/5.  Now we get to short selling.
Up until now the only people selling have been people getting out of long positions.  No big player has had any interest in shorting bitcoin, mostly because this requires going to firms that have even higher counter party risk than the ones you can buy bitcoin with.
I think it will be interesting to see when futures come what the "true market" is when there can be sellers just as easier as there can be buyers.  Thats all.  I know 2 money managers personally that are waiting for the Dec future launch to initiate a short position.
Short selling is just betting an asset will go down in price.
They are called futures because they are contracts that settle at "future" specified dates.  They are commonly used for hedging if your business is in commodities, or speculating if you're a trader/degenerate like me.  Hope that helped.
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:19:04
Jesus what a fucking idiot.  Just because something was envisioned doing one thing doesn't mean it can't unexpectedly be much greater at some other thing.
Redditors are so dense.
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:11:01
Sounds like someone doesn't know anything about fractional reserve banking
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:31:24
Wrong.  The vast majority of people will find it impossible to sit on 10x, 20x, 100x gains.  Trust me as soon as you are in that position you will see what I mean.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:19:01
I see.  How did them dumping a 6k market buy order OTC not cause a bump in the price on exchanges though? 
edit: nvm I guess it did bounce a few bucks as that trade went though, just a muted reaction.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:20:19
Oh it was profit taking and not the value of the short position.  Gotcha, thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:57:43
precisely.  im usually in the cryptotrading subs so I was surprised to see this sentiment here to say the least.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:04:08
How do shorts get rekt like this when BTCUSD is down over the last few hours?  what am I missing?
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:07:21
jesus you're a literal retard aren't you?  tough draw pal.
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:06:30
how the fuck do you read this and come away with "poor people are the problem" and not the elite running the show.
so dense.
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:13:22


this comment has convinced me to start acquiring crypto immediately.  sorry for your situation.  fuck central bankers.
@_date: 2019-04-14 23:03:51


Though it's worth noting they will take your gold as well at the drop of a dime if they feel so inclined.

damn you no coiners are really reaching huh.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:04:50
It sounds like you're living in denial and don't know when to lock in profits, see you at $1k.
I find it interesting you're so insecure about the future of bitcoin you had to dig up these old messages to tell me about how great you're doing.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:32:41
It literally printed in the 5k handle before my prediction date.   You people are hilarious.
I love this buy the dip mentality refuel though, letting me in at better prices (:
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:56:13
thats what the 5k handle means, pal.  I realize the sub 5k failed, but I was a single digit off and none of you had the balls to make any predictions
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:27:57
Are u dumb.  Bitcoin has done nothing but go down since our argument and hit the 6k handle once already, a hair off my prediction.
But of course you're gonna some how pretend you were right.  You're not actually still long that garbage product, are you?  Parties been over pal
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:21:36
is everyone in this sub 12?

@_date: 2019-09-19 22:01:26
I just disagree with the fundamental underlying assumption of most economic programs, which teach undergrads that the 2 unquestionable assumptions of economics is that
1. We need inflation
2. The government should be the one in charge of deciding that amount of inflation
Look into Austrian Economics and the concept of hard money.   A great introductory book to this that ties in with bitcoin is "The Bitcoin Standard"
@_date: 2019-09-12 21:19:31
The fuck does this comment even mean
@_date: 2019-09-03 13:14:34


idk it sounds like OP cant even get the coins and he is indeed himself.

I'm at work on a mobile lmao.  Theres a reason I havent bombarded u with links
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:17:32
Im a hodler, so I dont mind at all.  Its a great intro model and got me into btc before anything else.  I mainly looked into more papers on the subject out of curiosity I dont trade.
lmk what u think of it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:18:02
Theres plenty of antidoctal evidence as well, such as the fact that Switzerland was the last nation to drop the gold standard in 1999 and unemployment never once went above 2% until they did that and they had never experienced a single "recession"
Queue entrance of a federal reserve and the pumping of credit bubbles and they now have regular recessions like every other unsound money nation out there.
Plenty of other interesting facts like this as well, but you dont sound like someone who's actually open to changing their mind so to each their own.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:58:33


I see the maxis are out again in full force
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:08:52
This is the second most credible model I have found, and what initially got me into BTC.
I come from a background of algo trading and reading trading papers, this is the best price prediction related paper to BTC ive found.
Issue with planBs model is it only gives you a large time frame trend idea, its not granular enough to really be of assistance in taking profits or buying dips.  It more just says "you should buy this cause in 10 years it will be higher"
Paper I linked is more granular in practice.  It uses cost of production as the predicting factor, I.E hash rate of network.  It also makes nice logical sense that bottoms of bear markets would coincide with a flushing of all but the strongest balance sheet miners. (cost of production &gt; market rate)  See this pic that shows respective break evens for miners during each of the last 3 bear markets and where btc bottomed at: 
If anyone has any thoughts on this stuff id love to hear

@_date: 2019-09-07 04:12:40
the arrogance and pretentiousness and downright cowardlyness of feeling the need to invalidate every competitor from maxis in exactly why I invest in ETH.
Keep spreading FUD.  Read friedrich hayek denationalisation of money and get back to me when you're educated.  The founders of this ideology promoted the idea of multiple competing privately issued currencies.  You're both ignorant.

LOL no.  you should check numbers before randomly throwing arbitrary guesses out.
gold has a beta of -0.01, closer to BTC than your random guesstimate.
