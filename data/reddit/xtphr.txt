Thank you! dogetipbot is getting quite a workout today, isn't it? :-)

Here, add this to the legal fund.  Godspeed.

Dogecoin's inflation starts at 5% and decreases every year towards 0%. How is that hyper-inflation?  I keep hearing this repeated, but that's an inflation rate that's arguably less than bitcoins for a very long time.


I think that's thinking that's based not on economics but an ideological desire.  The USD has so much backing culturally, economically, politically and militarily, there's very little that could take it down, least of all bitcoin and crypto's.
Instead, cryptos are wealth creative.  They're definitely disruptive, but not destructive.

Are you sure that analogy works? I mean, Bitcoin doesn't represent objective, scientific truth.  It just represents potential economic activity. And economics is a group activity, so if Dogecoin is growing rapidly as a group, then it's not a matter of science v. faith.

I don't think we're in agreement as much as we aren't in gross disagreement. But I think we're definitely talking around each other.
I think dogecoin has already built a vibrant creative labor economy, something that no other crypto coin has. In terms of a practical economy, I don't think that anybody has built that yet.

You talking to me or Spats_McGee?

It could be, sure. But do you think that's likely?

Here's your answer: It was a joke, but it became a social experiment. Now it's fun, but no longer a joke.

People are selling because people are selling. You'll notice the drop is a slow, steady decline, not a massive drop. Dogecoin has had nothing remarkable happen, and people seem to think this is a bad thing and that Dogecoin should adopt super-new-technology-x asap or else it will die forever.
The reality is that boring is good when it comes to currencies, and slow and steady wins the race. If you want to know the true value of dogecoin, there simply isn't enough data yet to do anything but speculate.
For me, I'm waiting to December. For the time being, I'm grabbing some bitcoin on the way, and day trading that, but dogecoin is what I'm really interested in long term.

In even questions in that have been asked a million times before still have a handful of upvotes and a smattering of very helpful replies, and a half dozen tips to get people started.
I remember back in the day, dialing into bbs's on my 14.4k modem, and asking simple questions, and being told to "rtfm, n00b". It was really alienating, and yet  I ended up adopting that same attitude for a while. But has made me rethink that, and consider how important it is to patiently explain to the new users the basics of how things work.
I think taking a tough love approach to people already have a solid foundation and are just being lazy is fine. But when you're trying to build something to be big and popular, you can't act like that to people when they get right in the door.

I know, my last tip took about three hours. Maybe we should donate to dogetipbot for an upgrade.

Well, there's plenty of ways to see if some large user was just mindlessly moving coins back and forth. On here, you can easily find users who tip 10, 20, 30 times a day easily. But also, keep in mind that it's way bigger than Reddit's 35k userbase. There's also tip bots for Twitter that are very active, and there are a ton of faucets (Although less now with the price spike).
Not only that, but transactions for dogecoin have always been high, because it was never a currency that lent itself to speculation. So you'd have to subscribe to the idea that someone started their transaction bot a long time ago, with the idea that eventually it would pay off by creating the illusion of a false economy. That's just a little too unlikely for my tastes.
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:50:15
Yeah, but that's similar to being close to your credit card limit and having a monthly subscription.  It's just up to the user to make sure the funds are available.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:23:03


All of them. I mean, how do you define a good or a service? Most of the transactions are tips for content that the sender appreciates. Which means that labor which creates content that others value results in a transaction.
You would have a point if the transactions were simply moving from point a to point b and back again with no catalyst. But that's not exactly what's happening here. There are catalysts, although they  may be non-traditional.

This is, I think, the biggest failure of crypto currencies before Dogecoin. Economics _absolutely_ is about community. All economies are a numerical representation of social activity. Like all social activity, you move or you die. If your economy is based on hoarding and speculation, you are setting yourself up for an epic crash. If your economy is constantly moving, you have a healthy economy. I'm not a Keynesian, but this is something the Keynesians have understood that the Austrians haven't. Whether it's redistribution through taxes, incentives for investments and spending, or whatever, you have to move your economy, and the more it moves the better.
There are [more dogecoin transactions per day]( than all the other cryptocoins _combined_. This is the sign of a healthy emergent economy, not the price of a single unit.
The dogecoin culture of tip/spend/donate is what it will base it's success on. Even if a single dogecoin never goes above $0.01, because long term viability has nothing to do with per-unit price.

That's very reductive thinking, and does not accurately represent the many and varied positions of those who criticize deflationary models and unregulated markets.
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:19:26
I think it would be better if the wallet software had a "recurring subscription" option instead, instead of requiring online wallets.

It was pointed out above, but it's relatively trivial to move that Bitcoin code these startups are writing over to use Dogecoin as well or instead.  That's something that needs to be kept in mind for any alt coin.
