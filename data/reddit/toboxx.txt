Maybe some free users don't care. But serious uses do care. I don't think dropbox will user Sia. But I do think dropbox's competitors will.

The average users and the enterprise users should care becasue on Sia the hosts don't control the files but on dropbox the host control the files and can peek the user's files. Actually dropbox should care too because if a business like dropbox is built on top of Sia, its operation cost can be much lower and its security will be much higher and it can guarantee its users that it will never peek their files because it can't.

Serious users=users who pay for the service.

Sia is a crypto platform to provide an industry level crypto application/solution in live production. For Sia at this moment, price is a less important thing. The more important thing is to have more people to lease out their spare space to be able to earn money and cheaply store and back up their stuff on Sia platform.

If you can't answer this question, you should worry about the market position of your favorite crypto-coins. Eventually each crypto platform has to become an enterprise to be used by or related to ordinary people in their daily to generate a revenue stream to be sustainable. It can't be tech toy forever.
