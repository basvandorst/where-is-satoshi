I'll do it.

Cool idea. 2 thoughts:
1) A bitcoin address corresponds to a public/private key pair. Isn't there a way to send the user a password encrypted with the public key, and use that to verify ownership of the address?
2) If you sent 2 small transactions, they would be publicly visible in the block chain.

I'm being serious. Like losermcfail says, I was just sort of hoping there'd be a bar-owning redditor that'd be up for it. I have my own laptop and wifi, and would hang out drinking for an hour if necessary =)

An altchain with more frequent blocks, and by extension a higher hard-limit on transactions/hour could become useful. Or we might never need it.

If the market decides that BTC transactions are scarce and therefore expensive, couldn't some traffic move to the other blockchains that are better suited to more transactions anyway? So long as the other currency isn't competing for mining resources (e.g. LTC), could this be a good thing?

Any more promo codes?

Here's my attempt: "Underpinning the value of Bitcoin is that you can send value (priced in BTC, USD, gold, or anything else) anywhere in the world nearly instantly without the help of a trusted third party."

That sounds like a floor to me, and I bet you're good for it. Though I suspect people with tens of thousands of dollars tied up in mining hardware might make a better offer.

IMO it's not so important that it's "ASIC-proof". The important thing is that it's not competing for compute-resources with BTC, and therefore can't be 51% attacked by a big BTC miner. Most (all?) of the other alt-chains don't have this going for them.
