Haha OK. How many txns have you made? How many channels did you open? How many people % wise owns bitcoin? How many of them use LN? How much is your channel and how much would the fee be to open and close it on chain? 
It's like u bought a telephone and there is nobody else to call. Like zero
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:51:02
you just glossed over everything without a real response. typical Core head. and you used your magic wand, aka Lightning to magically blind yourself from the problems. 
lol ok. i will deal with it.
Also, yes. the nodes have to run the code, but they get dictated what to run or lose out.

not sure if this will work.... but it's worth a shot?
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:57:00
U know u still have to open and close payment channels on chain with fees. So how are there no fees? Do on chain fees not count? Seems like mental gymnastics to me. 
How much coin do you have? If btc went to $50k how long would that channel, last? A year? Month? Are you going to buy more just to LN the btc when you run out? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:46:01
Dude. Am I crazy or are these guys completely irrational at times about hodling to zero? It's a trade. Not your child. They have to stop being so emotional and see the facts.

@_date: 2018-01-26 03:51:25
Your response says everything I need to know about you. It's painfully obvious you uneducated and poor.  You will never admit it, but you know I hit it right on the nail. 
And to your point, Google is just an algorithm, right? Why do 0.6% of wallets hold more than 80%+ of all the BTC in existence? I think you meant to say "blockchain".

Why? What's your reasoning to keep it? When did you buy?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:02:49
he said it in the context of DoS and compared it to HST, where you get multiple intermediate transactions, and you just replace the intermediate transactions using the "IsNewerThan" value until the "nLockTime" is closed. 
That's the way I read it. It just seems like a stretch because it is out of context. He is not talking about 2nd layer nor facilitating transactions. He is talking about preventing spam.
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:11:56
Like I said, mental gymnastics. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:42:05
$3? yeah right. 
and again, why would I pay 1% at the exchange and $10 (actual average fee on the network) when I can pay 0% using my debit card? 
WHY? Do you not like money? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:59:29
triggered? i'm just asking you for an original thought. I can easily google all the stuff you sent me. 
oh, "literally" zero merits? it's convertible on Coinbase and many other exchanges for fiat to pay your rent, food, car. It has like $0.01 transaction fees. it's accepted on Dream market. It has everything BTC has, but larger blocks. Bitcoin doesn't even have merchant support anymore. Are you really this blind? 
Bitcoin is a business. No CEO? Yep, but somebody controls it. 0.6% of the wallets hold 80%+ of the coins. Do you really think it's decentralized and their goal is for the "greater good of mankind"? You are seriously delusional. 
And play with me? You haven't said a single intelligent counterpoint yet. Just copy and pasting nonsense.... Come at me bro.

@_date: 2018-01-24 18:37:04
Also, do you not see that we are centralizing the LN nodes by having to go through an exchange, just to avoid the fees? Who is going to have enough BTC to open a viable channel? 
If LN takes off, you are going to eventually see the Visa LN node and the MasterCard LN node because they are the only entities that have the resources and the motivation to make these networks viable. You will be issued a "Bitcoin Visa Card" that goes through these nodes, and we're back to a centralized network. If you think you and your buddies will pool together your piddling 0.1BTC and make a channel, you are straight up delusion.  
How does this not register with you people? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:17:32
LOL you're just making shit up...... I call bullshit, but let's run with it. 
so the 1-2 stores you might know that do not take credit card or have a Square account, will take Bitcoin instead and charge their customers $10-30 more? You are either delusional or lying. Good luck in the modern world. Where do you live? an Indian village? Cambodian jungle town? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:57:23
im starting to see that LN is just a way for the whales to cash out tax free. they keep pushing this issue onto the algae (most hodlers) to propagate their vision of a tax free way to spend all their BTC without ever answering for it, even though it will never benefit you. Why won't it benefit you? Because there is no way the typical person has enough coin to justify parking money into a channel, or buying coin with their salary to park it. Do you not see all the friction and road blocks along the way for LN to work? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 09:08:32
Considering the alternatives (Telegraph) definitely. But we have like at least 25 viable "telephone" networks right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:57:47
if you don't think BTC is centralized.... 5 pools control 62% of the network. 0.6% of wallets control 87% of the BTC in existence!
again, you are just delusional and wolfing down a lot of propaganda.

@_date: 2018-01-24 18:25:27
OK. let's try this again...... Forget the whales for a minute. 
Hypothetically, if I had ZERO bitcoin (Most people have like $1000 or less), Am I going to buy bitcoin at an exchange for a 1% fee, transfer it to your LN payment channel, even if it's "free or virtually free" via LN? Am I going to spend $30 to open that channel to use LN and park my $1000 in Bitcoin on the channel to spend? Why would I do this? How does this make sense in any way? 
Or you can just whip out the debit / credit card and make the vendor eat the fees and not have to park any of my money anywhere? 
It's not my narrative. It's just common sense. Who in their right minds would use this network? Why would you buy Bitcoin with fiat to spend it, when you can just spend the fiat, which is accepted by EVERYBODY, including your little mom and pops? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:41:11

@_date: 2018-01-26 06:08:56
If you think $5 is a lot, how can you possible think bitcoin core is going to work for you? You will spend 2 month salary on fees or wait like 4 days for the TX to go through. You might starve waiting for the transaction to go through.

@_date: 2018-01-24 17:15:11
sorry. i just had to answer this one too. Yes. they absolutely need third parties right now, during the transition phase pre-Lightning, because no business is going to be able to jump through the hoops of the bookkeeping and issues that come with accepting Bitcoin without a third party processor... right now. Even if LN does come online, they will again, have to go with a LN provider because, how is Mom's Bakery going to set up a LN on their own? Do you think we jumped from dial up to LTE without DSL and cable? 
They would also be committing tax fraud for not reporting properly and obtaining 1099s from their buyers. F the govt, right? Too bad it's still very much a reality. Gloss over much?

* create new code to add to it (not really, unless you want to fork, or part of the Core dev team)
* permission-less (OK, but so are most other coin)
* borderless (Sure, but so are most other coin)

* Derives value from no authority (yes, so where does the value come from? speculating it?)
* fixed supply (OK)
You make some good points, but I think Bitcoin does not monopolize the features you mention. Yes, there are bad coins out there, but not every one of them are terrible. 
Hypothetically, if you have zero Bitcoin now, why would you buy Bitcoin (from where? exchange) and then bury it into a LN payment channel? What's the point of that? Why not use cash?

Yes. I am arguing that Bitcoin is no longer special.
Your fellow genius above is saying "it's being used by somebody" but the amount spent on commerce is a trickle compared to the speculators. Monero and BCH are also accepted now on the dark net markets. they too are vehicles for speculation, but faster and more private.
So how is Bitcoin so great again?
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:39:03
do you have anything new? Anything original? Anything about this conversation about Hearn's email? Is your argument just copy and pasting links, with no thoughts at all? 
We've all heard this already, but it doesn't take away from the problems BTC is having. Instead of standing up on BTC's merits, all you do is trash BCH. 
Kind of weird how you crap all over Bitmain for giving themselves an advantage when Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon all have the exact same strategy. Bitmain is a business. Bitcoin is a business. It's not a millennial charity that gives away lambos.

Core nodes mine Bitcoin. They are one in the same. 
What news? merchants are dropping it because of fees and transaction times. nobody uses it for anything other than speculation. Drugs, hitmen, and ransomware can only go so far.

@_date: 2018-01-01 18:45:51
why is switching currencies not as easy? I can easily sell one coin for another. I can also convert to (gasp) fiat and pay my bills and rent. 
What do you use Bitcoin for now??? Speculation? Do you plan to wait until LN to spend your coin, even if it's worth like half of what it is now? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:44:13
ok, i concede. it might be real. but I still think the OP is reaching that HST = LN argument. Do you HST when you pay your phone bill? LOL  
I swear. If there was Mental Olympics, you guys would sweep the gymnastics medals. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:30:38
i'm just pointing out the OP is reaching with his conclusion that the LN / payment channels was part of Satoshi's original vision. His original vision is on the WhitePaper. If he felt it was important enough, he would have included it or at least mentioned it.  
Also, the context is all wrong. OP is trying to connect a statement about Anti DoS to mean  payment channels, when he was just talking about superseding transactions during a DoS attack. That's all... 
And if Hearn is telling the truth, Satoshi added 1MB block as a hack and was open to increasing the block size as the blocks filled up. 
I don't know if this is true. Just saying, if we are going to believe the OP's post, we should also believe the medium blog post. 
And I agree. Let the better chain reign supreme.
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:41:51
based on the context on the email, he was trying to prevent DoS attacks, not create payment channels. I think this is a bit of a reach. Hearn also said Satoshi wanted bigger blocks explicitly and was holding back until it was necessary. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:21:45
he also mentions that Satoshi wanted to expand the block size. 
He explicitly says it on medium. I think you guys are reaching. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:41:17
LOL another genius at work. I actually think you might be a little smarter than At least you stick to what you know. Nothing... 
how is it not a business? Mining gear manufacturers make money from selling mining gear. Miners make via block rewards and then selling the coin. Exchanges make money on commissions, fees, and margin traders. the real "hodlers" (i.e. not you) make money by selling you something that cost them $0.00 - $0.003. The only group not making money are people like you. That's why you cannot see it...

so let me get this straight. you are going to get paid at work, buy bitcoin and then send it to a Ukrainian LN node because you do not want to know who paid your phone bill? Do you even have 1 BTC? 
That is laughable. 
And stop associating all the benefits of blockchain to Bitcoin. It's like lauding pets.com because the Internet is great. We all know the Internet is great. But pets.com was not. These so called "payment streams" you speak of are not going to happen on Bitcoin or LN. The only way this works is with zero fees. 
Do you remember paying for email until Gmail came along? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:59:58
LOL sure it is.... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:06:40
right. just like how the BTC / LTC mining worked out so well for the little guy in the long run. Most people, 99.9% of the world hold less than $1000 in Bitcoin. Pooling and coordinating millions of poor people to stake their Bitcoin in a payment channel pool? Let's look at the average savings rate of most people. How much money do people actually save, and then extrapolate that rate to what people will with staking a Lightning node. 
You are talking about vapor in a bucket. The only thing that will happen is more centralization due to an artificial speed limit (1MB block size) that will force people to look at Lightning as their savior, when it will evolve into the ultimate enslavement tool. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:40:20
It seems like you are creating a problem by putting coins on a Ledger or something when you claim to be an active trader. It's like putting cash into a bank vault and getting it every time you want to "take advantage of wild price swings" in the market. 
The coin insurance policy and custodial account status on Coinbase is not good enough for you? 2FA to trade is not secure enough? 
The fact that you cannot use the Bitcoin protocol effectively to move Bitcoin (!) is a glaring red flag for me. It seems like you are saying, "look how bad our UX is, so we have an ridiculously complicated second layer solution to fix the terrible UX. or eat our fees!". This def sounds like the future to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:05:47
Agreed about reddit, but there is quite a lot of hysteria here. I am just bored after selling my stake. Maybe I should tone it down or held some for shits and giggles. 
Let's think about this in another way. 


How many can have more than $1000 in Coinbase? There are 13M Coinbase accounts and 142M American adults over 18. 
The system is set up so that the companies with the most capital will be the ones running the nodes. Your node will not be able to compete. 
Issues: 
- setting up the node. How technical are you? 
- getting people to connect to you
- securing the node against hackers
- maintain the networking and hardware / cloud server
- deposit bitcoin to create payment channels to probably a branded LN node like the Visa or Amex Node to be viable
- eventually, all the nodes point to a Visa or Amex type node because it facilitates transactions for the mom and pop node
- Centralization
Yes. Centralization is rife with potential for corruption, where absolute power corrupts absolutely. Imagine a future where regulation dictates that certain addresses no longer be allowed to be accepted on the LN. If the money is no longer allowed to enter the LN because custom LN software deployed by banks (yes, they can do this) and do a query for a bad address, or an address with restricted inputs, will be blocked from creating payment channels with any LN. This would make the coins dead because the centralization authority via LN will allow this. This was not possible with on-chain transactions.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:39:46
You are giving them far too much credit. The core code for on-chain transactions is basically the exact same thing Satoshi wrote 8 years ago. What was the major improvement of Bitcoin since Satoshi? These developers have done NOTHING so far except hodl bitcoin and impede progress. 
Bitcoin is basically controlled by a company called Blockstream, who intentionally limit the transaction flows to force transactions onto a centralized Lightning Network, run by the big banks we were supposed to replace. There is still money in developing these Networks, but this is assuming the masses follow Bitcoin. That seems less likely now, considering how complicated this new setup will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:23:15
You cannot dump that many shares and not pummel the price. How do you know they moved to Monero? Just making stuff up?
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:24:19
why do we automatically assume we cannot scale on-chain? Why do the Core devs think that the only way out of this problem is to centralize the network and trying to hide the fact that centralization is a certainty? How many Bitcoin Hodlers can you cobble together to compete with a really well funded LN node from Citibank? How many of those people will probably start withdrawing because they live paycheck to paycheck? 
If you route a Lightning payment through a third-party node to pay somebody else, that payment is recorded by the third party. The most likely operator of a LN node is going to be a big bank or a VISA. Trust is not decentralized because if the exit channel is centralized (LN), you can start blocking addresses. 
Nobody is forcing the opening of said channels, but if this is the only way out of the network to transaction commerce, these LNs become a big problem. What if the government, under the guise of preventing terrorism, starts mandating blocked addresses and blacklists? These coins are essentially worthless and will be destroyed by regulations. How can you destroy bitcoin?!? They found a way. 
Mining centralization is not a concern because mining is still literally a guessing game with no guarantees of finding a block. Any fraudulent manipulation by the miners would undermine the system and destroy their sunk capital costs. That is not going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:57:57
as a long time hodler, and a recent seller, i have to say that I was in an irrational state of mind. I was blinded to the flaws of Bitcoin because of all the money I made. If you did an apples : apples comparison of Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash or segwit2x, the only thing that bitcoin original has going for it, is exchange support and branding. do you remember lycos? how long can this last? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:11:54
you are making some massive assumptions: 
1. Most people hold less than $1000 in Bitcoin. Like 99.9999% of this world. 
2. Your little channel will eventually have to hook up with larger nodes with more channels to be viable, and the centralization issue keeps popping back up. what's to stop the LN system from blocking suspect addresses in this case? Or blocking addresses rooted from a certain address forever, and essentially destroys certain coins in circulation? 
3. Privacy conscious? I think the vast majority of people do not care about "privacy". Facebook has like 2B users (LOL), and Bitcoin has like 30M. Most people are poor. and they will favor lower fees and prices, despite your claims on people caring about privacy. 
4. You are assuming people are going to buy into Bitcoin @ $10K+ as a transactional tool and medium of exchange. 90%+ of all Bitcoin transactions are for speculation purposes. 
5. Data is the most valuable commodity and these LN will become data sponges. They will be run even at cost, or below costs for that reason alone. Will you run your LN at cost for just the data? This can even be folded into their already MASSIVE IT budgets and amortized better than any LN node pool can ever imagine. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:04:17


You mean speculators.... 


Doesn't change the fact that you will have centralization based on the number of payment channels opened (i.e. most capital deployed) and all roads lead back to the biggest network with the most channels. 


From 


So Bob is Citibank's LN node, and Alice pays me (Carol) through Bob, Bob knows everything! This is how things are going to work because you need more payment channels to make the network robust. And what makes you think we do not have to register for these LN in the future with real names? A little blockchain analysis can track you down using the LN. And this doesn't stop blacklisting, if there is an industry blacklist that all LN must follow to operate. 


So chicken or the egg? The beauty of Bitcoin **was** that the ecosystem and infrastructure built out on its own (miners). When did we have to start building stuff? Who is building all this stuff? It's not the community. It's mostly Blockstream selling business side chains for Lightning transactions, which is being forced because of an artificial speed limit imposed by Core. This is what you mean by "Now we're building infrastructure". 
When you say "we", do you mean you? Are you actually doing anything? Is that how you know so much about this?


Please see above about Bob, Alice, and Carol.

it's funny how you think the "bank holds it", but it's always going to be there. it's legally mine. What don't you get? my "hostage money" can also be spent without permission as well. When did a bank ever tell you, "Sorry sir, you cannot spend your money". Do you hold more than $250K? If you do, then I agree with you. 
Otherwise, this is a moot point and you are just throwing red herrings to try and make banks look worse than they are, to make bitcoin look better by comparison. Bank accounts are not the worst things in the world. I am sure you have one. If my bank says $10K today, it will be $10K tomorrow. Unlike my Coinbase account. 
This whole idea that Satoshi advocated payment channels is unproven at best. It was a third party account from another developer's supposed conversation with him, so there is nothing solid here. There is no email threat from him on record. If we are going off of that, I am free to say that Satoshi told me you don't know what you're talking about.
This Lightning network is exactly what Bitcoin was fighting against. Centralization of financial systems. Now, people with the most Bitcoin can park their funds and run a defacto bank their through node run by Visa or Goldman Sachs. The ones with the most Bitcoin (i.e. not us), will be running the same system with a different denomination. But who cares, right?

right, so we would just be back to using Visa or Mastercard, or a BofA Lightning node? What exactly changed? How is this the revolution? 
Right now, I can make any amount of transfers I want to these so called "digital transfer arrangements" in fiat. I do not have to lock up any amount of money for any amount of time like you would on Lightning regardless of amount.  
Also, you realize most people live paycheck to paycheck? How would this work for them?

perhaps the proper term would be centralized defacto institutions with enough capital to open multiple lightning nodes and payment channels to facilitate transactions through the existing financial infrastructure. 
I wonder who can afford to do this??? Perhaps a bank? or an incumbent payment processor? We are giving up freedom and decentralization to speed up an artificial speed limit (1MB block size).

OK. I'll give you that. 
It might be more secure than I previously thought, but doesn't change the centralization inevitability, does it? Nor does it stop the censorship due to the centralization.
This is also assuming people will be paid in Bitcoin to deploy on the LN or convert their money into Bitcoin to transact on the Lightning network in the first place. Most people (99.9999%) own less than $1000 in Bitcoin. Most people buy it for speculation. How can this end well? Why would anybody do this?

From Wikipedia : 
Electronic Mail (email or e-mail) is a method of exchanging messages between people using electronic devices. Email first entered substantial use in the **1960s** and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email.
Why are we talking about email anyway? Back to Bitcoin. 
So what is the purpose of Bitcoin vs Monero and Zcash? Speculation?

Transaction times are fast, but confirmation is slow? So if a fast transaction is not confirmed, did the transaction even happen? Does the speed matter if the transaction is not confirmed? Would you part with a good if the confirmation is not there? 
It's like saying you won a race, but you show up dead last and ask for your prize. You compare Visa and Bitcoin, and through some mental gymnastics, you come up with 30 day confirmations. I ran a business that took millions in credit cards. Chargebacks are a part of life (&lt; 1%). I would not start accepting Bitcoin over credit cards because of your weak argument over chargebacks / reversals. 
and let's not forget about the transaction fees! $30 to send any amount of Bitcoin seems a little ridiculous, but I'm the asshole who cashed out at $19K after buying under $500. What do I know?

I was all in on this, until I saw the flaws of Bitcoin. I was the biggest Bitcoin bulls, and now I am not. There are better coins out there, but your argument of

if this does come to fruition, these nodes will be run by the large payment processors (VISA, MC, AMEX) because they will have to integrate the legacy systems, and these companies will need to deposit large amounts of capital to make use of the LN. It will no longer be peer-to-peer because the payment channels will be centralized to LN nodes that have the greatest economies of scale, and the lowest fees. This "lowest fee" marketing will be an indirect way to centralize Bitcoin transactions to the legacy infrastructure. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:48:19


No matter where you send to and receive from, your phone bill or your rental account is the end point, and that is associated with you no matter what. why would you even do this when you can just pay cash anyway? Why is this better? Where do you conjure up 1/700000 of a penny? it's more like 1% to 0.1% and these are just numbers pulled out of the air. 
And Lightning's fatal flaw is a greater than $0.00 transaction fee. Why would anybody want to build on top of a metered system, regardless of how small you think this fee is? Why do you think the AOL's hourly dial up died out in favor of all you can eat dial up and then broadband? Why do we all have unlimited calling plans now? We all want more for less. A revolution does not happen without more for less. Can you think of a single revolution where we got the same thing for the same price? 
We are getting about the same or worse, for the same price. Lightning is not a revolution.

I think they have like 15 guys working on lightning. i guess you have a point? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:45:58
Well, how many payment channels would you need to open as a node to be viable? 300? 1000? Bofa? Chase? Paypal? Whole Foods? Or maybe there is some "Bitcoin Lala Land LN Node" that connects to all of the companies mentioned above. In either case, with millions or billions in revenue, you would need to commit proportionate amounts of capital to make sure the transaction flow can be met. 
That would mean billions would be enough to run a real node that will be competitive. If you have like $1M in BTC in a node to like 5 channels, how much economies of scale do you expect? Not as much as what Visa can set up. They can open up $10M to each node without blinking and eventually starve the little nodes out of existence. 
You can say that people might flock to the "grass roots" nodes, but when they start feeling it in their wallet, they will switch over to the cheaper, identical versions run by banks solely based on price. Look at Amazon, Walmart, etc. They crush businesses and use money as a weapon to destroy competition. Do you think this will turn out any different? 
This is assuming you can actually educate poor people about Lightning. I can barely educate people on Bitcoin, wallets, keys, and now they want to add more complexity to an already absurd abstraction? Nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:27:09


wow. you are so deep and thoughtful. I am so enlightened now by your educated and thought provoking rebuttal. is this really your counter argument? 
HODL til you are broke? LOL
So how is LN not a centralized network, that will be run by the richest of BTC holders and incumbent payment processors or banks? how much bitcoin do you have? prob not enough to run a real node. 
Currently, I can send any amount I want without restrictions, plus a ridiculous transaction fee. In the future, if these nodes get really big, they can start blocking addresses and payments and not accept them on their LN. How is this not censorship? How is this not centralization and control?  
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:20:29
why was this downvoted? ostriches.... last year, i was paying like $0.50 / transaction and I thought that was a bit excessive. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:02:47
Yes. It is parked there until you spend it. In a bank account, you hold it until you spend it. You would have to think about what you spend and convert it to Bitcoin? How is that going to work? 
Scenario 1:
I send $100 in BTC to my Starbucks LN. $30 fee, $100. What about $1000, so that $20-30 fee gets averaged down. Does this work? Not really. Who would do this?!
Scenario 2: 
My employer earns revenue through Bitcoin, and they in turn, pay part of my salary in Bitcoin. I deposit my Bitcoin in a LN micropayment node channel (probably run by Visa, Mastercard, or Chase LOL). So I have to pay rent, utilities, car, insurance, food, etc through Visa or Mastercard or whatever side chains BlockStream is planning to sell to businesses. Doesn't this go against what Satoshi envisioned?

@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:49
If it turns out to be centralized? 
The basic economics of LN shows, the rich get richer, and only the rich can set up a realistically economically viable node. You cannot set up a robust node without many channels opened (i.e. lots of deployed capital). But what about the individual Hodlers who can pool? Do you think the abysmal savings rates of the US or any country is going to translate out to them "saving" money by parking it into a node? Only the big holders are going to be in this market and the little guys will be crushed by the billions in capital deployed by incumbent banking systems. 
Yes. the use is optional, but isn't this just another version of net neutrality, where the stake holders control the transaction flow? wasn't bitcoin supposed to be this decentralized dream, where money flows as easily as emails? So we are given a choice between paying fees, or inevitably centralizing the network, and going against the very thing we opposed. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:50:33

@_date: 2017-12-28 04:32:41
Isn't this just another checking account? Aren't we centralizing all Bitcoin with LN nodes instead of banks? Isn't this everything Bitcoin was supposed stand against? 
what if i don't want to park any money? don't you think that the banks will eventually have to operate full LN nodes to integrate into legacy systems more efficiently? They are the only ones that will have enough money to park in different payment channels to make this work economically. Not regular Bitcoin users with their puny 1 BTC or less. 
- What's the difference between this and our system now?
- Why is this a revolution? Because it's in Bitcoin instead of Dollars? 
The Satoshi system is peer-to-peer, without compromise. This "Bitcoin" has been compromised. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:31:21
The regulation isn't set for LN. The software is open to tinker with and modify and certain nodes maybe be coerced to stop taking transactions from certain inputs if they want to operate in a region. 
The cost of opening a single channel is not big, but opening up multiple channels to link payments to make the node viable (i.e. many interconnections), it will cost a lot of BTC / capital to open those channels. I think your fallacy is that you assume the nodes will be cheap to operate, or they will be economical to run without a certain amount of scale, but look at mining. You would need a certain amount of channels opened (scale and capital) to make it work efficiently.
Let's see how this all plays out. That is, if we even get there at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:48
OK. Please enlighten me. What would you consider the major commits this past year? What do you consider the most important code commit to Bitcoin ever? 
Moreover the future of Lightning is still up in the air, but do you really think you can change user behavior this much? Opening payment channels if you have like 0.25 BTC? You have all the incentive in the world to lease out your coins if you are holding a significant stake, but most do not. Do you really see the user, not a hodler, buying into this? 
Please note: I was buying into this in early 2015 and held a significant stake. And rode the bull all the way up and cashed out around $19K after reading about Lightning. I believed in Bitcoin before the BCash fork, and now it's just a clusterf**k. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:50:03
Economies of scale will centralize LN. That is assuming Bitcoin is used for more than speculation in the near future. 
Like most people probably have less than $1000. Where are they going to get more Bitcoin? I think one company in the world pay salaries in Bitcoin. So most people would have to convert dollars into Bitcoin to put into a LN payment channel. What if the government has your address blocked and your entry into the LN is dead on arrival and your coin is worthless because nobody will take it, even in the black market?
Who would you do this???? WHY? Because it's cool? It's Bitcoin? To the moon? 
What if I just sent money, directly to another person, peer-to-peer. What a concept!! I hate to say this, but Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin. I was opposed to this concept for a while until you start seeing the major flaws of Bitcoin Core and their roadmap. 
This is coming from a seriously Long time Hodler and Bitcoin believer, who sold after seeing the truth. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:14:18
I LOOOVED Bitcoin. Head over heels in love with it, until it was vandalized and corrupted around August (Bitcoin Cash is Satoshi's Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core is Blockstream's Bitcoin). I am here because I am trying to find out more information about the general sentiment of Bitcoin holders. I sold when I started seeing stupid memes on the front page and people with absolutely zero knowledge posting things that actually make it to the front page due to sheer dumb hype and stupidity. Apparently, we're going to the moon....... As if 10M people are going to be billionaires buying Bitcoin. It was an obvious sell signal to me. 
Don't get me wrong. Bitcoin can still go up for all the wrong reasons, just like Herbalife. Some scams are so big, it becomes a public company! But I am not high on that prospect. Look at Friendster, MySpace, Lycos, Alta Vista, Yahoo, AOL, Tumblr, and the list goes on and on. They all had cutting edge tech of their time, but the cracsk in their foundation were overshadowed by valuations and hysteria. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:26:46
example : nicehash hacker's bitcoin address
if this address get blocked on the future Visa or Mastercard LN node due to regulations, these coins are basically dead. anybody with this address associated with their inputs (blockchain is open to query), the coins will not be accepted into the network by some external blocking protocol they build on top of Lighning (Open source). Anybody that has coins from a particular wallet will be considered a criminal and will not be accepted on the network. The perils of centralization. 
Any future transaction from this wallet will have some taint on it, and excuses for the government to start blocking at the centralized chokepoints (Lightning Nodes)
And then, when it comes time to do an actual fiat exchange, there will be plenty of trail to sniff around and question you. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:11:48
OK. so you got me! The intermediaries do not see the transactions. OK, so next question. Who is going to be able to afford to layout millions of dollars to make viable payment channels? Are you going to trust "Bitcoin LALA Land Lightning Node", or the "VISA Lightning Node"? Who do you think most people will trust? This still goes back to centralization and censorship. And what makes you think you will not have to register with your real name on these Lightning nodes? 
Also, how in the world are you going to get millions of people to buy into this??? Normal people do not own much Bitcoin, and they definitely do not spend it. 
I genuinely believe that the early holders of Bitcoin are trying to create a way to maximize their wealth and earning powers by imposing a lot of things that go against the original principles of Bitcoin. How can you cash our $150B is their only motivation.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:58:26
LN is Big Banks 2.0. Big banks or Visa are the only ones capable of deploying massive capital (payment channels) to make them economically viable and then make the transaction fee income. The larger the LN network, the lower the fees, and this will stifle competition. Do you think a puny mining pool or LN pool can compete? 
This post has no substance and is the mindset of the typical BTC investor now. No clue about financial infrastructure, no clue about crypto, gobbling up hyping and thinking they have an actual substantive opinions on the matter, when they basically say NOTHING. 
How exactly is this system better when we cannot even scale transactions on the main Bitcoin blockchain protocol and have to give up our freedom and decentralization for lowering artificially high fees through the absurdity called Lightning. Good luck with your DUD. I'll push FUD, AKA cold facts. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:12:21
Major benefits of bitcoin that no longer apply: 
- anonymity : false (Monero is better, Zcash, Dash)
- low transaction fees : false (Litecoin, IOTA, Ether are better)
- fast transaction times : false LOL
- micro transactions foundation : false, even with lightning.
- store of value : false. talk to the guys who bought at $19K LOL
- accepted everywhere : false. The lambo / condo dealers convert it right away and it only works on high value transactions. 
Good luck buying groceries and then paying $25 in fees. Or locking up large chunks of cash / Bitcoin in a Starbucks Lightning account and then taking it out $5 at a time.

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:31:06

@_date: 2017-12-28 21:42:55
transaction time is when your transaction gets picked up and included in a block that will be added to the chain and all the transactions for that block divided by the 10 minute blocktime. 
Confirmation time is the time it takes for another block to be minded on top of your transaction block. most exchanges require 6 confirmations, or 6 blocks on top of your transaction block to be finalized. So 60 minutes is right with 6 blocks / confirmations @ 10 minutes each (bitcoin protocol block time)

It's strange how you cannot accept an opposing view of a seasoned Bitcoin investor, despite my argument being well thought out and fact-based. I am not here to start a fire. I am here to see if my prediction was accurate. And based on some of my threads with these so-called "investors", I think I made the right move.

but if this is the future of money, how can you not make a simple transaction like buying coffee??? 
That's your excuse for such Bitcoin having such a bad user experience? It's only used good for large transactions? The dream of Bitcoin was the stability of gold and ease of sending money like email. Bitcoin is not there and has taken a nose dive in the opposite direction of its intended purpose.
You are saying Bitcoin is basically useless without Lightning. Lightning will become a centralized network of payment processors with banks, corporations, and large BTC holders who can afford to open up large payment channels and collect fees.
Wasn't Bitcoin's goal to break the grip the large banks have over the system? Ironic, huh?


So you're telling me, "you can see pictures from across the world on my computer" in 2001. I am glad you find this whole permission-less value transmission, non-inflationary money thing fascinating, but Bitcoin has been around since 2009. I think a lot of cyrptocurrencies do this now, and much more, without fees.

so hypothetically, everything vets out, and we get the Lightning network. Are you really going to start opening payment channels with Starbucks? Or maybe your landlord? Or maybe Amazon? 
And if you do not have one of these channels, opened, you must reroute your transaction through another Lightning node, and all this magically gets settled. Bitcoin is already a fairly complicated concept for most people. Do you think this will actually gain traction? 
Opening up a Starbucks gift card type channel with everybody you interact with? 
How is this the revolution of money? 
Also, what has really changed since the beginning of bitcoin other than the price and difficulty and supply? Fundamentally, the core code is basically the exact same thing as it was when bitcoin first came into existence. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:28:48
I sold because of lightning. Fud to rebuy? You think I can move the price by talking smack on some reddit post? I wouldn’t buy bitcoin for anything less than $1000 with LN attached. 
Actually LN is all shit.  It seems like other currencies can make on chain scaling work with low fees. Not bitcoin. And that’s why the price will continue to fall.  Yahoo of crypto
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:56:25
Lastly, have you ever actually "used" Bitcoin for anything? Made a purchase? If you have not, you will see that Bitcoin is quickly becoming the Herbalife of Tech. 
Bitcoin's value is not going up because people are using Bitcoin for transactions (i.e. Herbalife products). Instead you make money by creating a network (i.e. Herbalife Health Clubs) and hype them up with teenage millionaires (Herbalife President's Club). It's like buying into Yahoo, Excite or Lycos in 1997. They were cutting edge and amazing back then. But now, Google is looming over the horizon and people are still talking about Yahoo and pumping the stock up to illogical highs. 
After reaching $4000-5000, I believe we reached maximum utility value for Bitcoin and everything on top was a bubble. There was an actual use case back then, but the fees absolute fees (fees in BTC), and the relative fees (converted dollar value of the fees) are just too high to support commerce. Their idea of building the Lightning network on top is akin to putting a garbage dump on top of a landfill. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:40:05
so your assumption is that "big companies would not set up LN nodes", but why not? They get fees, interest on money, guaranteed returns? They would need to be the interface between the existing and "new" financial infrastructure. This is unrealistic to assume they will not set them up for financial gains and just basic integration if this takes off at all. 
So Bitcoin Core is no longer peer-to-peer, is it? It's becoming this convoluted Lightning network that requires a third party to transact or get raked by fees! That goes against the very essence of Bitcoin. 
**Abstract.** A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online

right. he mentioned it, but he didn't think it was important to include it into the core code. also, Satoshi mentioning payment channels is some third party hearsay account from some email.

so we are reinventing basically the same exact thing we have now. what's the point of that? why would users change their behaviors if it's the same thing, but more complicated? 
people don't even spend bitcoin anymore. They just hodl with a "greater fool" mentality. How is this going to work, even if LN is implemented? When nobody spends, and just hodl? 
Bitcoin is not useful because the fees make it useless to everybody but miners. This LN is vested interests (early holders, miners) are trying to maintain their profits by using all the BTC they already accumulated to run LNs and also extract maximum fees from on-chain transactions.

Those funds are never "locked" up because it's just a credit balance that I can potentially spend, not money you put in to spend. Under the "new system", you are choosing to lock up capital you actually do own in order to gain returns, but how does this relate to your idea of "credit availability that you are locking up". These are totally different concepts.

In the short term, all the coins move with Bitcoin as the main driver, but some have their own merits that will show up as value in the long run. 
Most governments are too vested in deficit / debt driven economies for any government cryptocurrency to have much more value than utility face value. They will be cryptocurrency in form / function, but will not likely have a supply cap like Bitcoin that gives it a perception of scarcity driven value. There might be innovations in transmission of govtcoin money, peer-to-peer, via government wallets, but this will be subject to monitoring on the blockchains.

I think Enron and Worldcom also had brilliant people working for them until the very end. I am not sure how these two issues have to be absolutes. 
Bear Stearns had smart people working for them until the very last day. What's your point? And have you seen the price lately? You don't think they're already bailing now?
Please note: When you sell a Bitcoin, it goes through a market matching process, of finding the best match for your offer and vice versa for your offers to bids. If you offload 1000 Bitcoin on a market order, it will fill everything in the order book until it completes. If there are no bids on the way to fufill this order, the price will plummet. These guys are not going to do that. You can milk cows plenty of times, but you can only kill it once.

Most of these developers have huge stakes in Bitcoin and it is in their best interest to code with their huge stakes's interests in mind. This means setting up a network, where the rich get richer and the transaction flow becomes centralized like the current banking system.

And why even have a layer 2? This is how the current banking system works now. You have to go through intermediaries, just like the Lightning network. The entire idea behind Bitcoin was to subvert the incumbent systems and transmit peer-to-peer, yet, we are devolving back into the very system we were trying to replace! =/

Even if you went on chain to swap addresses, the blacklist will persist because of the black listed input transaction and you will not be able to spend that coin. It will be essentially destroyed, not even salable on the black market. 
Lastly, off chain scaling is not "unlimited". I don't even know where you would get this information. It is proportional to the amount of resources a company or node collective is willing to put in, meaning capital, networking, servers, etc.
