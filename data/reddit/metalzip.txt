For example the currencies like B2X (by Jeff Garzik) for example was made with the idea, and for the purpose, to destroy Bitcoin's development team. It was implemented by removing any replay protection to make it harder to just dump one coin.
Also some coins like "bitcoin cash" have marketing team, created by their centralized leadership (Jihna Wu and Roger Ver) to try to pretend to be "the" Bitcoin.

In the public protests, we have many incidents of violence by left and aforementioned leftist terrorist organisation.

you seem to mix up some things here, "public business" but "private organization" - what?
Usually the division that can make sense is:
- public service
- private business
In public services that are provided by country after country forcefully took everyone's money (taxes) - yeah well should be to everyone, since you can not opt out and it is the biggest monopoly, and everyone has to pay for it.
Private business you do not have to pay. Both people agree then you transact, if not then no.

IOU would mean that you hope someone will pay, but they can refuse.
Instead, in Lightning Network, the balance is already yours, just that it is not yet claimed on-chain, and short of the other party attacking you - the money absolutely IS yours.
Other party would have to active defraud you by publishing older state, which can be countered by watchtower.
So the states in LN are not just a promise like IOU but are cryptographically yours (though if you expect all your watchtowers to be offline for long time, all at same time, AND your LN peer is a fraud, then it is safer to finally move it on chain)

Their best friend is a **convicted** pedo,  (  )
(ok, convicted for hebephilia not pedophilia, to be exact, Im using "pedo" as a mind shortcut)
In June 2008, after Epstein pleaded guilty to a single state charge of **soliciting prostitution from girls as young as 14** ,[25] he was sentenced to 18 months in prison.
They and Clinton (housband) 20 times took the pedo-plane (lolita express) to the island where Epstein lives (lived) with underage girls, and has painting for example presenting a sex trafficing victim that was murdered in rape, in the pose in which she was found bounded by the police. For some reason.
Interesting that pedo Epstein had orphans on his Lolita Express (for obvious purposes) and on his island, and that Clintons run Haiti orphanages. Yeah Im sure they do it totally for altruistic reasons :D 
p.s. to clarify, one same principle, we probably can not be sure how deep is the connection, until she/they are locked up (after a fair trial and with good evidences), how ever that is super shady, who flights freaking **Lolita Express** plain, **20 times** and leaves his bodyguards behind, only for this flights, each time. ������  
&lt;/redpills&gt;  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Even leftist sources like Wikipedia has enough clues and facts on this.


Unlike Clintons pedo-friend Eppstein, no evidence, no conviction, nothing besides some random gossip. The one with walking in on naked woman's room is so random that never ever seen it pushed by even his total enemies.
And btw, FYI, many boys do that (not that it is perfect ;) but please do not collude such silliness (rooms of starts at set have locks, btw) with things like rape, or child prostitution to which Clintons have connection at least.
Anyway - exactly as with the PsyOp against the gun guy - random bullshit based on slander.

Btw, **Taxation is theft**.  (same as you should be able to just buy own food, instead central gov taking everyone additional 1% of income and buying everyone "free" oatmeal that you hate).
(yees roads too and shit, guys investors exist and build even larger **private funded** projects, you buy entire cinema complexes, shopping malls and other private things just by then buying in them daily stuff - sad become so mainstream that this needs to be explained to supposedly **cypherpunks**/**ancaps**/**self-independent** people. Yes central army, and very few other things might need to be centrally paid - but that is like 2% of country budget, easily covered by opt-in land tax, instead of **spying on each citizen, questioning what is income and what is profit and then punishing for being profitable**).
So if you made a lot, why not take the route that some millionaires make and just move to other country?
* kingdom of Monako (located near France/Italy) has 0% income tax (need around 1 million $ to become citizen)
* there are few other high quality (not "wild") countries that have that. Bermuda. Hong-Kong and Singapore practically have no tax. Many other countries make it really easy to pay no income tax (which is a theft) if you set up company properly (get pro accountant for that),  and then you just pay an opt-in (so not theft) tax like for buying land to build your company/home on.
* many of "wild" countries are not as bad as they paint it, no not just Somalia ;)
* there are dozens of 1st world countries "just like USA" that still do the theft but at least are less hostile against citizens when stealing tax, e.g. do not hunt them all around the world so aggressively
If bitcoin would go to 100,000$ or 1,000,000$ and (many of us) would be multi-millionares that easily can buy house and travel weekly in/to another country, would you then?

We need to allow people to opt out, **in given country**.


We talk about a law/tax system in a country. Replying "anything is possible, just get out of the country" moves the goal post and is not the topic.
In addition
* it's quite impractical
* world is almost out of places that allow that  (there are very few places with 0 income tax, and no free places)

 is a better word.
What a retarded thing to nit-pick on in my post.


Not sure what you are ranting about, but in case of Epstien he was found guilty, on good evidence and on own admitting guilt.  And close ties of his hebe-related (or as everyone calls it: pedo-related) activities to Clintons are documented with hard evidences, like flight logs (whooops).

Volountary tax in exchange for something, like leasing land.




You can build the society you  want based on such freedom. You can not do that when the base is country that takes half or more of your income and regulates everything, and for example bans guns for self-defence, or recreational drugs.
 


Because that is the problem.


Yeap, that is the country that "federally" doesnt have taxes nor regulation, and locally people invent more restrictions (laws) that match their needs.


socialism is regressive, as it takes away freedoms (see above)


That component is socialism, when you promise people free money for nothing, they will get dependant, and the problem is that you eventually run out of other people's money to spend on the ones demanding it.

What is "fair share"? Is that some codeword for "come commrades, let's steal from the damn rich"?  And if they refuse the gulags?
That is true that biggest players are the ones avoiding taxation, but going more into socialism only worsens this problem of course they will always find a way.
Level playing field is when there is no mandatory taxation, other then people exchanging goods and services, voluntarily on free market. If state much take something, if it would be that we can not ourselves defend own borders, then this can be done still without income taxation.
UBI is regressing and will require massive income tax, if the UBI is ment to allow a person thrive without any other source of income and no matter how many people choose this way of life.

I see that bcash shill already replied with same lies,  so let me post here replies - because some vocal minority of altcoin users is often repeating them so it is good to know why it's false.


Lightning Network is more decentralized then Bitcoin. People here are not buying into your Bcash propaganda, go away to with such nonsense.
LN is more decent., because once a miner grants you the opening channel, you then do not need permission from a miner, you can do what ever amount of transactions you want - at much lower fee, or even for free (depending only on you and other users of LN that you choose to go through, not depending on will of miners).


Another fat lie. LN is trustless.  No one can steal your money there  (if you use it in recommended way).

The article claims 2 vectors,
1) one seem to be: bootloader copies all storage to RAM -&gt; the chip used has a pin that dumps all RAM (e.g. to USB?).
The firmware update will NOT FIX this, IF I am correct in understanding that the firmware-updater code has same flaw (it copies all store to RAM), and that firmware-updater code can never be updated itself.
I am waiting for reply to this in 
2) There is a suggestion that there could be another way of attack. No idea about it.
The first one seems real, that this non-secure chip indeed includes such a backdoor of a pin that dumps RAM.

How many sub-streams of Bitcoin can fit there, at current block speed per 10 minute, like 2-4 right?
So while 1 stream transmits the newest blocks, there would be substream  that is same but delayed say 1 hours (so if you miss one block you will catch-up on the retransmission 1 h later),

Centralization of mining in China (or any 1 country) is bad in case if
- their gov orders them all to censor given addresses (and any txes trying to spend them etc)
- if they are one entity they can collude (or their gov can step in and ask them) to do things like orphaning all blocks that would try to go around the censorship of payments
- they could also collude to rewind chain by few blocks and double spend. Such things already happened, e.g. rewinding block to set the result of "random" "fair" casino games (it took only &gt; 50% for that to happen)
and many other things, mining should be decentralized if it's all done by 1 entity then all things fall apart.

Current problem is that BTC transactions can take few USD per one,  though in upcoming months/year the Lighting Network should solve it.
Until then, you can just buy more in one bigger transaction - and then spent some on things were getting VISA is even more work/cost, and leave the rest as possible investment/speculation.
Btw for smaller shopping, there are various cards afaik, that you can buy for say 50 or 100 USD in one go and then spend it for like 1 USD purchases many times.
Maybe  - for Amazon shopping (didn't test it).
Also Steam - buy wallet 50$ charge once, and then spend on like 20 small Indy games ;) or hats :)

@_date: 2017-08-28 10:26:21


* 8 MB blocks in time = less ordinary users running validating nodes = less audited money
* they instead propose to blindly trust the miners, and some biggest exchanges and corps to validate
* even more centralisation in hand of 1 group (the miners) instead ballances and checks between 2 groups of power (miners and users, both fully checking each other)
* also this means centralisation in one country / political group (China)
* no support from the most experienced and biggest developers team
And also
* no good support for Lighting Network in trustless mode
* so they will not get the x1000 scaling and instant 100% confirmed transactions
* they lack SegWit, they do plan something to replace it (and allow LN) but it doesn't seem to be at all developed, and again they lack developers
* much of their user base hates LN anyway and wants only on-chain scaling

The same force that determines value of 1 hour of "tutoring math", or 1 gram of gold, or of one used i5 CPU.  Free market.  Some people want to buy at given price, if they are buyers then this is the price.


Well price is decided by people who choose to buy.
You could ask about supply, why doesn't someone increase supply - well you need to do very complex math calculations that take specialized hardware, to be awared a bitcoin - and this calculation results are checked by every other user (running bitcoin node), if you would just cheat and try to spend bitcoin that you didn't earn (or didn't got it from other legitimate owner) then all other nodes, users, would just ignore you and would not honor your claim.

I actually do not see false advertising of Bitcoin, or false FUD about it's forks and alts, on . At least not on main page nor in comments. What would be an example of that?  Even if, it seems to happen to at most be very rare, while there it is the standard.


From technical perspective, (besides just not "I don't like their reddit") I would say:
1) seems some of the toxicity of their main sub will leak a bit into their karma, so still that is a small minus, from business perspective.
2) their solution to scaling is dumb and not a way to scale to VISA levels
3) they prefer to give up self-validation of the coins by the coin users other then biggest players - bye bye trustless money
4) they clearly are centralised over miners (see above), and in particular now around the Chinese miners, and in particular around Jihan and Roger Ver
5) Their EDA is leading to over-inflation (over supply of new coins) which long term must kill the coin (unless it would be incredibly successful by other means first)
6) Also they are now in the Oscillation of Death (also EDA).
7) It's probably first fork/alt that does not play sort of nice, but is designed to just shit on the Bitcoin. That will piss off lots of old timers and we wish it dead the sooner the better.
For all this reasons, I would say dump it (like 80-90%).

Right, this is an actual big complaint. They really should add this function ASAP!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:35:25


Oh, seemes I replied to wrong post here by mistake.


Yes I know people do not do that.  (I mean some people do, but not enough).
This is why we need systems built on greed.
Bitcoin is one system. Greedy miners do what is in their best interest, and system still works.
Greedy users seek lowest fee - and system still works. That is good.
As for political systems of a country - just do it as you do with any other system for masses done commercially.
E.g. with cinema. Replace "road" with "a cinema" (or shopping mall) and you have all the answers:
Price of building the cinema is incorporated in each ticket, and paid upfront by the investor.


Well he still has to pay the ticket.  (e.g. roads could have a fee to pay for them, you can pay onetime or buy weekly/montly/yearly ticket).  Btw this is working like that in many countries (payable highways are one example; private parking spaces are very similar example).


Investor pays to fix and maintain the cinema / road,  and later retakes his costs in the price of tickets.
As for city roads, there should be also some auctions system where investors bid to manage the road for next say 5 years, and at same time the citizens can pre-buy the ticket for next 5 years (or at least set a constant price) so they are not left without any viable road there.

I will use crypto because it's more control, because it grows in value long-term, because I do not want to depend on banks, and it's nicer to use.

Any groups trying to steal Bitcoin name doing various forks, will be rejected, until they bleed out of money and die out.

It is good for both.
Just buy a bit now, or monthly like for 30$ or something like that (using totally spare money) - and never sell it before it goes to like 10,100$ or more. 
Also, never sell all of it, sell at most half or you will regret it if one day it reaches 100,000$.

They will speed up, yes. But after 12 hours BCH will artificially lower it's diff to be profitable to mine, then again day of slowness, and again 12 hour pause.
Continue until high inflation kills off BCH, and Bitcoin Judas and/of Chinese Gov runs out of money to subsidise the exchange rate.
After BCH takes everyone's money will slowly die down, like most shitcoins/altcoins.

Yes. Bitcoin is not like, the coin to send every possible micro transaction by every human to every other human.
Replacing all VISA would take 60 TB / year,
replacing half of all fiat overall probably like 90000 TB / year, no one without a large datacenter would do it.
Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless, I want means to verify if my Bitcoin is valid. Even if it means you can't send some small transactions unless you wan to outbid the ones that send more.

Now SegWit has like 1% adoption. When updated wallets, exchanges, merchants will default to the SegWit format addresses, the effective tx/h can go up by around +70% (other factors remaining the same).
And make sure you are giving people the new address, not the old one.
When you are given address by a merchant or person, ask them to give you SW address.

I created a sub to list and logically refute such points that are (imo) incorrect.
Right now discussing exactly that, and they say there is no need to validate blocks (by regular users, except for large like exchanges) because it's not realistic that miners would try any attack ever on SPV users.
Please take a look, or maybe even join - logical civil discussions, that allow "both sides" (but excessive repeating of same unsubstantiated claim without arguments for it, or other spam, still gets moderated away; mod log open)
; and also high-five, for node operators :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:17:35


At smaller delays you have some chance of mining "in time" - but you just lose money. 
If block takes 10 seconds to propagate and verify before you mine on it, you lose (on average) about 10/600 = 1.6% of income.
Mining is very competitive, let's say 80% of what your income from mining goes to costs (electricity, hardware, warehouse, staff, repairs, security etc), so 20% of income is your profit, so you lose like 8% of it.
Seems like good incentive to mine near the current biggest cartel.
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:20:52


If you must sell btc because you think it will "burst", then at least do it to gold :)  But yeah if you just want to re-buy very soon then maybe not.

**Taxation is theft.**
That is even more true for taxes based on income or profit - they are literally the punishment for not being a looser / for working and making something for what others want to pay.
There are countries that try to have only opt-in "taxes" (which is moral), like the **Liberland** (new microcountry in Europe).
And there are dozens of well established countries with no income tax.

If channel is open for next 1000 blocks, and e.g. Alice receives BTC on block 900, then she has the transaction that gives her and Bob the correct current amount - for example Alice 55 BTC, and Bob 45 BTC.
She could give this tx to a bot, and instruct the bot that in case if she appears offline then before it's too late (e.g. before block 950) the bot should publish it.
That is the same as she would close the channel with the current ballance, except, it will still happen at the right time even if she would suddenly fall offline and miss the deadline.

Open questions to developer/CTO and (paging - for clarity,
because neither the attack article, nor the trezor logs are fully clear on this:
* Does current Trezor (up to 1.5.2) store the not-encrypted **seed words** in the permanent storage of Trezor? (as opposed to e.g. **AES encrypting** the seed data with the PIN)
* Does current Trezor (up to 1.5.2) store the not-encrypted **device label** in the permanent storage of Trezor? (as opposed to e.g. **AES encrypting** the device label with the PIN)
* Does current Trezor (up to 1.5.2) store not-encrypted, not-hashed **PIN** in permanent storage of Trezor? (as opposed to e.g. storing there only **hash of** the PIN; EDIT: the SALTED hash, of course)?
* Does the hardware used allow to dump the permanent storage of Trezor quite easily, that is, by attaching to some pins (after opening the case)? The article suggest it just needs to connect pins with a paper clip and can be done in few seconds
* ... and does it allow to dump the RAM of the device?
* Does the hardware copy the PIN, the label, and the seed from permanent storage to RAM on start? - was it the case before the recent update (&lt;= 1.5.1) ? Was that what got fixed in 1.5.2 ?
* Is/was there a method, for this hardware (running original firmware) to make it dump it's RAM and/or storage, **without opening the hardware** case (without breaching the hardware)?
* What does the CONFIDENTIAL attribute do? Does it prevent some methods of dumping such data?

well, just before BIP148 ultimatum, non-segwit had around 70% support.
And the Bitcoin Core seems to be taking the neutral position, the "no change" position, and this no-change is the "winning" situation, so even more so I doubt hashrate will do much to fight it.

I hope in a year bitcoin will be capable of even 100-1000 more payments especially for reoccurring things (e.g. daily shoping), and fees will be &lt; 0.10 $,  in some cases even &lt;0.01 or less (e.g. small group of few parties that trade with eachother can run a zero-cost per tx channels network, and only say monthly pay like an USD to reopen the channel on-chain)

@_date: 2017-08-28 23:03:20
This is not how LN works, there is no kind of "double spend".
You have a signed TX. Ther bot can only publish it for you. It can not e,g. change the recipient, or amount of money or anything.
@_date: 2018-10-22 23:00:47
Also, do your trades on Lightning. When searching for a service - try picking one that supports that.
It means INSTANT payment and very low fees for you (by default 0.01 sat/byte if it would be calculated by normal byte size). Can possibly go even 100 times lower!
So you pay around 0.03 or even 0.001 or 0.0001 USD per entire transaction.

Yes, they are getting sexually harassed and raped on daily basis, thanks to socialism - the idea that people who contribute nothing have some "right" to parasite or rob everyone else.
Socialism incentives being lazy - why work - someone else will give you all basic needs.  So of course such people come there.
Capitalist countries with low or no taxation on the other hand incentives being productive, making something that other people on free market freely want to buy from you. So this is what kind of people it gets.

But that cost is linear, and can be small, anything starting from txcost * 10 probably makes sense (better *100), so like 1000 USD is very good investment already, and 100 is doable.

Easy solution for it, would be Uber-wallets. You buy a coupon for say 50$ and then keep spending from that.
If you just buy directly with BTC, then you get a coupon allowing for say -2$ discount when buying the 50 USD wallet (so you pay 48$ for it), so that it's still very profitable even with not-trivial fees.
And in future just directly switch to lighting network :)

* read various sources, sites, podcasts
* critical thinking, there's lots of silver tongued con artists who want your BTC. E.g. the censored subreddit pumping up BCash, and Roger Ver in general.
* run full node (pruned)
* for bigger amounts, use offline computers, cold wallets, Trezor, Ladger and mixture of this. Fo really big ones use multisign address
* prepare a "last will" to leave BTC to family (share seeds, perhaps as multisigned and distribute signatures, on paper in many safe copies)
* it is more likely you will lose the passwords then that you will be hacked. Still be safe, but make many backups of that passwords/seeds. Even of that "just 10$ of Bitcoin" hard-drive, one day it can be worth 100,000$. Backups of the data, and backups of the passwords to it. Multiple copies, different locations / people.
* imagine war comes, you move to other city and to other country. You forget about "that 1000$ in BTC" amids all the fighting, fires, floods, bombings.  Locations are destroyed. Some people die. When you came back after 10 years, do you have the data/passwords/seeds to claim your now 1 million in BTC?

Problem with oversupply is for example following: miners who want money, and dump coins they mined (as we assume almost all do), now can claim few times more USD per month, then on Bitcoin.
So the much much smaller ecosystem of BCH and their buyers, much provide more money for their miners in total per week. This can't be sustainable, Roger Ver could con few Korean guys, maybe Chinese Gov given some money, maybe Jihan Wu drops some money to shoot at capturing control of Bitcoin and pump demand for his ASICS they are selling... but eventually this money will dry up.

Well depends on the length of it. I guess most users go there with actually "a word" or something.
If it's a 20 character random string then sure.
But still, it would be better if trezor would calculate that and only Trezor would ever see this 25th word (in case if computer is compromised) after a blind-keyboard input.
Actually, even better, would be to calculate half on trezor and half on the computer (so that trezor device will never see such, say, 26th "word", in case if there would be exploit on trezor related to this, e.g. leaving the word in storage somehow, or in case if the USB cable you used was hardware-backdoored and transmits/store the data).

It's good to waiting a moment for software to be deployed, before looking at results.
SegWit was activated less then 24 h ago. I would look at it in a month.
Would be dissapointed if by end of the year the situation would not resolve itself, e.g. in form of paying each few months something like 5 USD and in return getting access to thousands of micro-transactions per day per user, each costing below like 0.1 USD (hopefully more like 0.01 USD).

If you have less then 300 GB of free disk space then edit options and add option prune=1000 (duckduckgo it).
If you have less then 150 GB of network data per month data cap, then instead install a light client - Electrum.
Then buy bitcoin anywhere, say at  (from a high reputation buyer) or on some exchange.

It was lock-in of the "let's now everyone vote on segwit" :)
Now as result of that, 100% of blocks voted on segwit (&gt;95% at least), so now segwit is locked it.
as result of that segwit will become alive in 2 weeks
in 2 weeks we can use segwit on real BTC network
in month(s) lighting network will in fact work on BTC network, and we can do millions of transactions for USD (when sending back and forth in pairs of 2 users)
and later - on global network (probably with some additional, but small, cost)

"They are stored in plain text as seed words. Instead of storing a 250-bit number they are storing it as 1000-bit extended plain text with a lot of redundancy. "
yes, that is pretty fucking stupid.
any comment, why not store just the pure bytes?
Also, in the flash memory, why there are literally the words instead their binary "compressed" version (with maximum entropy) the current situation all kinds of attacks easier (e.g. if you can read SRAM/flash around 75% of bytes without error, then it's easier to correct the read errors).


in the new ones, the seeds duplicated to RAM are in fact overwritten now due to that CONFIDENTIAL attrib that moves them to first few KB of ram tha is also reused by bootloader, right?

But you will never able to do it on-chain again (cheaply) because - **free market**.
Look, if Bitcoin is reaaaly successful, do you want to store information about EVERY cash transaction in the world, every coffee machine, every parking TICKET, everyting, done in any point in ENTIRE TIME, stored on EVERY BITCOIN NODE in the entire WORLD - stored FOREVER?
There will be like MILLIONs of people wanting to store their THOUSANDS of MILIONS transactions in each of hopefully THOUSANDS of computers, computers who currently volunteer their rising costs.
That is just insane. Also, a privacy violation.
Therefore way forward is to have 2LN layer scaling (fast easy and private), and in the central WORLD-WIDE public ETERNAL ledger store more important things, like the monthly or yearly summary of your funds (channels open/close).

Yeah and something being open-source, or Bitcoin, does not mean it is not owned by someone.
Bitcoins are very much owned only by their owner with private key.
ASICs are owned by someone. They are not being handed out 1 to each 1 person in the world.
Bitcoins are owned by people who paid or traded or mines, not given out 1 to 1 person per 1 year. Do you think they should be? It would be a horrible currency probably, and I would certainly not like to use as much as BTC.
 


Sure, you might decide to exclude yourself from **copyrights**. Or maybe even remove copyrights and patents all together. That could be interesting, yeap.
But now even with your cars someone will be owning the actual car, will be paying for gasoline used, for repairs.
if you think Linux or OS implies some form of communism then you are very, very wrong for above reasons.
btw open source like Fire Fox costs millions of USD, and the owners of Mozilla org are/were making a fortune on it.
 






Ok but then again we are back at the same thing: you plan to become a millionare owner of large fleet of cars.  Or if you mean it that lots of people will give make their cars join the cers, then millions of such people, will just refuse to fund any socialist ideas like "basic income" - they will keep the money from themselves.
And people who do not have a car, will not get such income.

* data sent are tiny for each transaction, network b/w is not important if you are small player. 
* it scales: if you do millions of txes per minute then yes you will invest more into servers and network... but this scales with the income. While mining blocks, it's always 1 MB (or ~4MB, or 8MB in altcoins, up to like 100 and more) to be received no matter how small miner you are (you need entire block)

I didn't read too much on his story, and the quick wikipedia reading is too vague "inhuman treatment" it seems can nowdays mean anything from getting PoWs to drink water from normal plumbing system that is normally used in civilian prisons (but some crazy representatives cry about it),  putting them into too crowded rooms, as well as in torture and random heavy beating.
But I would just not use "war criminal" before I know the details;

Of course, everyone agrees. But renaming "Bitcoin" to some new name just because someone tries to take over it, is a bit confusing.
What when fork Bitcoin Silver comes along and splits from Bitcoin (BTC), will we have like Bitcoin1xSilver and Bitcoin1xNormal?
What if someone gathers 1% of support and proposes to give x5 higher reward to miners in each block, will you rename bitcoin1x to bitcoin1x1x vs bitcoin1x5x ?
Of course, best option could be to just go with Bitcoin / B2X, AND give user option to customize it if he cares.
Then vast majority for which Bitcoin is Bitcoin BTC is happy, and few B2X fanboys (where are they, anyone seen'em?) can edit it to "the only true Bitcoin" too.

Then new one is:
algo(x) = algo(i) mixed-with algo(j), and randomize 2%
Then this paper says, that this is also genetic algo:
algo(x) = pure randomness 100%

Yes you can, for example 200 byte transaction can cost less then 200 sat. It could cost 1 sat in total, so 1 sat / 200 byte, so 0.05 sat/byte.

You provided no arguments, besides your opinion that this is "idiotic".
I have argument though - most complex utilities, like the Internet - and Internet in every country, are largely privately funded, and where they were public-funded this become source of problems (like monopoly in USA) and people now wish it wouldn't be this way.
100% privately owned luxury ships are no problem, despite costing even for example 500,000,000 $ - people just fund them from the tickets.
There is no reason why city infrastructure, that costs less, wouldn't be funded in same way. People pay per amount of land used for example.
Actually, this is already how this is done.
Already cities (or some small governance units) are funding via local tax, which usually (or at least in many countries) is fair flat price, like a ticket.
Not an income tax.
There is no problem in paying for utilities or funding them together by a group of people. Just that global and income-bases taxation is immoral and bad way for it.

That is nice, how ever with main stream media the biggest problem is that they totally lie about what someone said.
One example could be when that guy who attacked kids for being white catholic smiling man, was reported by MSM (probably incl CNN) as "Vietnam veteran", while that guy was never sent to Vietnam and he said he was a "Vietnam **times** veteran".
So we will have a timestamp... on a fake quote, twisted by today's journalists.

Not bad, though in ancap no one could tell you e.g. you will go to prison for doing drugs. Or at least, you might be forbade that in some city, but you can find or even start new city (a village rather) that allows that.
States of USA in theory are kind of like that, but in such ancap (or to be exact: in city-states) the law is far more local, and there is basically no federal law (nor federal taxes).
In place of federal law, you have universal law that is really minimal, that is the NAP principle: "do not attack others" in general.

Bitcoin is doing just fine.
Segwit2x was planned to stop the fork. But fork happened (BCash).
Doing Segwit2x now will not prevent a fork. So it's pointless.
It will only create a 3rd fork now.
Why you support this attack "divide and conquer"?
Yeah we can masturbate and virtue signal like the bitcoin Judas how "any miner can do what ever so not 'an attack'", whatever, but **strategically - dividing into 3rd fork and then pushing unaware users there - is certainly weakening the Bitcoin and eroding trust in it**.
Hopefully users will learn and will now always verify they use the Bitcoin, the Core's Bitcoin.
And you will be remembered as the guy who helped attack it, and people will lose tons of money in the process. Is that really needed? What do you think you will accomplish here?

EU is, as soviet russia, getting rid of private ownership and forces public-ownership in many branches, but not all.
It certainly applies central planning, like soviet russia, EU imposes, for all countries that joined it, central limits of productions; For example in farming they centrally plan how many milk can each country produce - LOL is that free market? :D
Other laws then set min/max price of this milk - also free market right? :D

The Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Republic of the Marshall Islands — In a move that, for anyone following the progress of cryptocurrencies, was truly inevitable, the world’s first country has adopted a digital asset as legal tender. From the Associated Press (AP):
“The tiny Marshall Islands is creating its own digital currency in order to raise some hard cash to pay bills and boost the economy."
“The Pacific island nation said it became the first country in the world to recognize a cryptocurrency as its legal tender when it passed a law this past week to create the digital ‘Sovereign,’ or SOV. In the nation of 60,000, the cryptocurrency will have equal status with the U.S. dollar as a form of payment.”
The Republic of the Marshall Islands (R.M.I) plans to distribute the SOV sometime in the near future through an initial coin offering (ICO). R.M.I. will cap the number of tokens at 24 million, representing the country’s 24 municipalities.

And they are right - communists, socialists, are indeed idiots. And it will fail as each commie experiment in history.


But there are many articles all the time, about fire-fighters, medics, refusing to enter the Arab's districts, because when they do, they are attacked with thrown stones.

No, CNN is the most fake media, while Breitbart shows information that CNN will hide for ever.
For example this Sweden's gifts of free houses to ISIS terrorists, can be confirmed by googling from tons of other media outlets, probably you can as well find the official gov's statement on this as well.


We're not talking here about some citizen stealing two apples from neighbour,
we talk about murderers and terrorists. It takes a mentally ill person to take them back in, instead of hanging them.


There is huge gap between blindly attacking someone's homeland literally thousands km away from your border, and inviting in terrorists and gifting them houses.


What, murderers? I do not want to change them, they should be hanged.
I suppose some cucks, if they see a guy who murdered their parents, would gift them free house, and stuff, and would invite the murderer to live next door, but that's generally a mental illness. If you are "that guy" then probably I'm wasting my time explaining anything.


Btw, that is communism. (Or socialism/statism; how ever if we take this approach further then soviet russia did, then I'm pretty sure it's communism in this area of life, otherwise we would conclude no country did "muh true communism" - the no true scotsman fallacy).


They are NOT from a war zone.
Also, it's not one incident, this happens always, anywhere they go.
This is just their civilisation.
Again, this is one thing to "judge" every Arab or every Islamist, or every nazi solider or every German (in around 1940) and shoot them on sight. This is too much. E.g. nazi soliders were better captured, and their leaders put on trial for war crimes.
But that is insane to say organize post war program to invite ex SS leaders and gift them free shit.
Some countries did that, but of course in secret, simply in exchange for gold, and they harbored the war criminals. Now sweeden goes into that direction but openly from citizen's tax money, LOL. Communism gets weird.


Above approach is communism. If you defend it, then you might not call yourself it, but you support communism.
Actually, even Russian soviets were not that insane to gift stuff for free to freeloaders that were not even their citizens, that's some new level of stupid.

Or: reset trezor Spare1,  WRITE DOWN IT'S SEED  !!!   and create address on it.
Init: trezor Spare2 with seed from Old1. Use it to access old funds and send all to the NEW address on Spare1 
Then use same device Spare2 but reset it and init with seed from Old2. And do the same.
If you can not init a trezor with old seed (not 100% sure how it was working) then instead just use Electrum or something.
Do not lose money by moving it too fast, check if you have proper backup of new seed.

It is, and that's why sane people say EU is run by lunatics and Marxists - look up any statistics on crime.
This information is heavily censored, so look a bit deeper.
Moderators here are asking to limit offtopic, so we can discuss elsewhere. But where, entire Reddit joins EU and UK in censoring any news..
You seen news about today attack in UK? The media already try to paint it as car "Accident".
To discuss, see other side of debate, like  or  (or daily stormer, but it was censored on DNS and IP level - seems you got a bit too much of that thinking there, citizen - though is on Tor).
Anyone interested can look a bit deeper for the statistics that government hides from you.

Well the point is also to protect YOU.
You should do all bitcoin transactions on such node, or you risk money being stolen (other wallets might accept B2X as Bitcoin - SPV wallets).

Trezor is quite unprofessional about privacy in many aspects.
They approach Tor users as second-level citizens too, no .onion, and you need to solve the stupid captchas, and if you do not then it just fails without any notification.

1) Many people avoid the theft (taxation) by using Bitcoin, compared to regular bank accounts.
2) The system itself, is mostly free of taking taxing it's users - there is money supply, but more of deflation then inflation. And anyway it is opt-in and known in advance, opposite to what happens with FED taxing every USD holder as they please by printing.

Not at all.
1) You at most lose ability to receive more Bitcoin (downloading new blocks of blockchain), and to spend it - but it is there waiting for use.
2) Since this year, you can now use Bitcoin without Internet - by using a satelite, there's a special sat transmitting Bitcoin blockchain.
Setup cost is around 200-400 $ in parts.
3) To spend a transaction you need just to send like 200 bytes of text. You can even post it, or SMS it, or write on piece of paper.
Actually now there are also services where you can in fact SMS a bitcoin transaction and they will send it to Internet for you.
Btw, there would be a problem if ENTIRE internet would be for ever destroyed and humanity would not rebuild any such information network ever - which of course is not happening, unless we're all dead.
In all scenarios "my country lost internet - due to heavy war" are solved as above.

God I hope we can buy up and replace the Reddit by 2021.
Fire cuck u Spez - the CEO of Reddit, who's notorious for impersonating Reddit users, breaking into their accounts and **editing posts this reddit users had written** (server DB access) which he did to attack his political opponents.
Fun trivia: 
Reddit CEO did that, e.g. to people on reddit who were investigating rumours and leads about child-abusing sex ring related to politicians, e.g. the convicted child abuser - sentenced for soliciting 14 year old girl[s] for prostitution - [Jeffrey_Epstein]( and his ties to Clintons (esp. Bill Clinton whom took the private plane with child prostitutes with Jeffrey to his private island around 20 times).
Reddit didn't liked this topics (in subreddit now banned), so they started fighting, and then CEO stepped in to impersonate users.
We really need a distributed (not censored), and also secure (signed posts) version of Reddit. How can we use it for anything serious, like Bitcoin discussion when content of no post can be ultimately trusted.

No one claims **100%** of the time they refuse to enter **100%** of areas. 
Only that would you refute by providing some example where they in fact are not afraid to enter.
Do not move the goalpost, I said that **some of the time** (anything over 1 incident per year is cause for alarm), they refuse to enter **some of the areas** (the real no-go zones).


You think getto zones how low crime? Or that they kicked out their hosts police / do not snitch to them and instead solve things inside own society?

If people make less transactions because they now like charge some merchant-wallet in 1 onchain tx and buy from that 20 times,
instead of doing 10 onchain tx for each, then use is rising not falling.
We have a healthy number of transactions, so that at max load on daily cycle it fills mempool, and later it drains to zero "over night". Very nice.

 There is now counterfeit fake-Bitcoin, called "Bitcoin Cash" (Bcash, BCH)
BCH is not BTC. It has over 10 times lower value, and keeps falling since it's "creation".
It's a mostly dysfunctional currency, that can not even produce blocks in reliable manner and fails every few days where entire networks hangs for few hours for half day - look  (the speed should be smooth line, best around 1.0).
 Also there is another counterfeit coin that tries to name itself "Bitcoin" - the B2X (or "Bitcoin Segwit2x")
That B2X is completely different and incompatible with real Bitcoin Segwit. ("Bitcoin" now includes technology called "SegWit", and the fake coin is named "Bitcoin Segwit2x" or "Segwit2x" or "B2X").
Many large popular exchanges will start selling you fake-Bitcoin "Segwit2X" under name "Bitcoin" ! Read the warnings on 
B2X is also failing, it's evaluated at below 25% price / support of real Bitcoin right now -

They still each few days post lies, e.g. that money in SegWit addresses is not safe and that anyone (or in other version: any miner) can steal all this money easily, because this addresses are of "ANYONECANSPEND" type (completely ignoring fact that all clients updated in last years, have a rule, that changed meaning of this type of address in case if segwit is activated via miners vote, and it was activated that way thanks to BIP148).
Also, they keep trying to confuse / steal the name "Bitcoin", by constantly popping up with topics "Let's call Bitcoin-Cash just Bitcoin".
In adition they randomly use BCC ticker - which is again "stolen" from a long-existing established other altcoin: BitConnect.

@_date: 2017-10-06 01:16:08


No one said anything to the contrary.
Turn off your "omg racism" trigger, and read what actually was said and you can avoid such nonsense.
I said that the situation is, for **what ever the reasons might be** that certain races on average do not make good workers for e.g. STEM fields.
Btw, same goes for genders.
Tell me this: do you think most IT companies have &gt;80% man (at least before artificial "correcting" it by hiring **based on gender** to "correct" the problem invented by leftists) because IT guys can't stand working with a woman? Or because like 90% of job applications are from males, because females are not that interested in this field usually?
P.S. Bitcoin developers seem to be &gt;80% male, and also &lt;20% of Negro people (some are anon maybe, but from the ones that we know about) - is that because...
1) Bitcoin Core are sexist racist rednecks who hate working with females, and hate working with black people
or maybe
2) It is more rare for female, and for black person, to be highly qualified developer, and interested in such a bit nerdy crypto technology?
So which one is it?
Btw same goes for Bitcoin conferences from what I've seen (eg regarding male/female).
So should Core hire a diversity officer, to write ads that we will hire Bitcoin developers, as long as they have boobs and dark skin - this is the main qualification needed, because gotta show the world we no racist)? Should they? ��
This was my point in first post, that companies (and projects) anyway hire based on merit, and any imbalance between groups exists because: **some groups are actually not equally identically good for the job (for what ever reason)** - before you triggered white knights jumped in, eh.
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:29:45


You can't justify your position.
Trump is a winner - yes, he is the president, he won presidential race.
Same as Bitcoin is the winner (market, also hashrate, also organic nodes and users).
Your logic/rbtc logic: "but reeee he isn't a winner, that doesn't count, do not loook at market, market is confused, do not look at hashare, it all doesn't matter because $reasons" - see same logic "do not look at election, it doesn't matter, voting mechanism is bad, ree reeeee".
Trump is a racist - well everyone is a little and that is cool, but is he a "racist" like libtards see it, e.g. the next Hitler or shit? Nope, every LEGAL citizens is free to stay, and have the same rights, regardless of his race (despite what some libs said).
So that's a lie.
Show me one **racial law**, or Executive Order that mr. Trump introduced, or you're a lier, ok? (or apologise and correct this misinformation).
Same like rbtc / bcashers daily spread lies about SegWit, same you, an anti-illectual, parrot libel you herd on probably some CNN or other fake news like "omg he is racist" - but you can not explain your position. Why is he "racist"?
Based on this two examples, we can see that rbtc is like CNN - ignoring clear victory of "enemy", and posting crazy libel that does not make sense.
Do not be like bcash/r.ver cult. Do not be a lying cuck like they are. Provider arguments of your crazy allegations or consider reviewing your position.

You said, few posts above, that the "problem" is that some kids do not know basic shapes because they didn't learn them.

For "some reason", Asians have best score (also sorted by household income), White medium, Negro worst.
Look, all this "racists", the damn racist reality.
Also, if that would be true, then all profit-seeking companies would hire, randomly, almost equal number of all races, at high-tech positions, and no "quotas" or "diversity officers" or "99 genders consultant officer" would be ever needed.
Fact that cold, profit-seeking corps, end up with certain groups of people more, and others less, is evidence that certain groups are less often good IT hire. That, or corporations prefer to reject larger income and instead "be racist" with no objective reason to it.
So will you keep being triggered of someone daring to put facts above fell-feels, or can you do some research?
p.s. No one cares if this comes from genetics or from other factors, what counts is the hiring market. On the market, workers for jobs that require high STEAM skills, have not identical level of average competence between the races. This leads to companies choosing to hire from the best group. And then "diversity officer" is bring in to hire people from less suitable for job group, just to virtue signal to idiots that think that hiring by merit "is racist".

But in this particular case:
- it's really a very not-kind move to miss-credit someone, just do not pretend you're the author... community should opposer such behaviour imo
- if it's true that this guy [EDIT: the other guy there, JJ] promised to not publish details until there is time to normally release fixed version in normal release cycle, and then does otherwise, then it's breaking a promise

Bitcoin is anarchy. Get out if you're leftist/socialist.
 


even if not for the rapefugees, all other criminals also do not respect laws. That is why they are criminals.
 


EDIT: you pay up 1 million in taxes over life, and then gov "generously" gives you back 0.2 million for health care, what a deal!  Alternative is that you think:
1) bureaucracy operates at negative costs :D
2) that central planning is better then decentralisation. in such case quit bitcoin, use VISA/invest in VISA companies shares
3) that you will get money from the rich. But the very rich are best at avoid taxes, always can move away, and anyway are too few to steal from them (not even mentioning morality of robbery aspect of forced taxation)
 


Or to not get a job because of minimal wage.
I would rather do some shit with Bitcoin for 5$/hour (e.g. support staff) then do official burger king jobs for 10, thanks to assholes it is illegal. How dare you deny me opportunity to work?

Uhh? The topic of this post says "give out free cash",
the wikipedia says "A basic income [...] is a type of program in which citizens [...] receive a regular sum of money from the government. A pure or unconditional basic income has no means test".
So they receive monthly/yearly some money from govnment for NOTHING, on NO CONDITIONS.

It is nature, who forces you to work (or gain food somehow), not "me".
You can check this easily by imagining you're the only person on Earth, things that you still MUST do are then natural ("earning" or getting food, shelter etc),  things that you suddenly do NOT have to do were enforced on you by others (paying for war on other countries, paying for war on drugs, paying for SJWs - and all other things taxes go to, minus the things you would want anyway, like a road).

State Police? **mostly** no. They harm people by enforcing crazy laws, for example anti-drug laws. (the really needed "feds", well, smaller city-states can fund from their budget - which can be gathered without income tax, and without involountary tax).
Or they SWAT our Lopp, lucky that no one got killed, just because some idiot makes a phone call.
They often, especially in USA, go way on the brutality line.
How ever a local police, where you can actually decide what law they enforce, hire/fire police chief, and that would be *actually* serving you, as paid servants - sure.  Many things can be done without forced tax.
As for things that could use general "federal" tax, like army to defend borders - there are taxes that are not income tax, nor VAT/business tax, and are opt-in and therefore more fair.
For example tax when buying or renting land from country.
There already exist several countries with almost none, or totally tax none income or related tax, and some prosper very well.
TL;DR:  forced income tax is immoral;  Voluntary, local, opt-in tax is much better.

We indeed get 2 tokens, as with BCH, but there is zero protection:
* both use same address
* they have no replay protection - when you make a transaction where you send to Bob 10 BTC, Bob just has to re-broadcast your transaction back to B2X network, and then he gets also 10 B2X - even if you never intended to do it
You can do a split, but it is a bit complicated.
Most users will not do it I'm affraid.
Also, many SPV (edit: typo) wallets, like Mycelium etc, can by mistake move to B2X without even warning you.
Tldr: after the fork, wait few weeks for things to clear up and ask here and see  to be sure, before sending any coins that you hold in anything else then in full Bitcoin Core wallet.

Stealing sticked comment to paste warning about counterfeit-Bitcoin, like "Bitcoin B2X" and "Bitcoin BCH" that uses same address format "1..." and that many businesses are trying to sell as "the Bitcoin", but it is totally incompatible other coin, with much lower value.
- be aware:
* Bitcoin - Bitcoin Core - Bitcoin SegWit - BTC - BT1 - is the real one worth over 5200$, homepage:  ; home sub * Bitcoin Cash - BCash - BCH - BCC - is the first fake Bitcoin.  below 7% of value of Bitcoin. Home subreddit r_btc , home page: bitcoin dot **com** (instead .org) - run by same guy Roger Ver.
* Bitcoin Segwit2X (with the 2X part) - B2X - BT2 - is the second fake Bitcoin. Below 25% of value of Bitcoin.
(**BCC** is also a name of unrelated, real, established, 6 month older altcoin: "**BitConnect**", but BitcoinCash stole its ticket name and also tries to use "BCC" though community seen through this phishing attempt and names BitcoinCash as "BCH" instead; Yes, conman Roger Ver running sub r_btc and bitcoin dot com also supports this phishing and supported name "BCC")
***the real Bitcoin is for clarity named "Bitcoin Core"*** and is the one that has wallet "Bitcoin Core", it's homepage is as always  . Do **not buy fake Bitcoin** that is "Bitcoin Cash" or "Bitcoin Segwit2X" (or "Bitcoin Gold") by mistake!
Also watch out for **phishing sub-reddit** "btc" run by known conman Roger Ver (Bitcoin Judas) as a way to promote his bitcoin dot com website and the fake-bitcoin (he is co-creator of one of the fakes, the Bitcoin Cash), where they constantly push propaganda and lies about "SegWit" technology (part of Bitcoin).
 1) There is now counterfeit fake-Bitcoin, called "Bitcoin Cash" (Bcash, BCH, BCC)
BCH is not BTC. It has over [10 times lower value]( and keeps falling since it's "creation".
It's a mostly dysfunctional currency, that can not even produce blocks in reliable manner and fails every few days where entire networks hangs for few hours for half day - look  (the speed should be smooth line, best around 1.0).
 2) Also there is another counterfeit coin that tries to name itself "Bitcoin" - the B2X (or "Bitcoin Segwit2x")
That B2X is completely different and incompatible with real Bitcoin Segwit. ("Bitcoin" now includes technology called "SegWit", and the fake coin is named "Bitcoin Segwit2x" or "Segwit2x" or "B2X").
Many large popular exchanges will start selling you fake-Bitcoin "Segwit2X" under name "Bitcoin" ! Read the warnings on 
B2X is also failing, it's evaluated at below 25% price / support of real Bitcoin right now - 
**Do not get conned.**
 3) There is one more fake-Bitcoin coming up, called "Bitcoin Gold". But everyone ignores it anyway.
So be careful, ask around.
Ask if you are buying the real Bitcoin, or full name "Bitcoin Core" (see  - the homepage of Bitcoin).
Always get few sources of information, e.g. phishing subreddit r / btc - is writting and hosting every day on home page obvious lies to discredit "Bitcoin", they even say Bitcoin doesn't check digital signatures and that anyone can steal anyone's money, lol.
They post this lies in order to promote "Bitcoin Cash" altcoin (and try to call it "Bitcoin" to confuse new users).
Well, some users might be even there genuine users, who got conned by others, are conspiracy nuts, or are simply jealous of Bitcoin / Bitcoin Core developers success and want to replace them with own self.

So there is profit. Btw, HDD is one thing, network connection is another. I know people for whom this was the reason do not run, only SPV.

then is there any hope of recovering that money at all?

Ok then simply looking at prunned node versus SPV node.
Prunned full node gives higher privacy.
There are users that would prefer full node (especially when this benefit is promoted more) - but due to network usage constrain they have issue.
The more we increase the size, the more of users will decide to not do it.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:31:08


And yet people do not choose full node (except devoted bitcoin guys)
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:56:52
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:18:55
It's logical that if you demand bigger blocks, precluding even more users from running full node (even prunned one, if the slow network is the problem for them) - then you are not satisfied with LN.
Alternative is that you are fine with LN, but you just want to needlessly increase block size for no good reason.

@_date: 2017-05-14 20:16:06


Full node gains privacy (over SPV).
Doesn't full not-prunned node (over prunned one) allows you e.g. to query some information about blockchain?
Plus it's for your own good if the community is stronger.
Plus you might selfishly want to connect own prunned/SPV clients to your node (e.g. higher anonimity)

@_date: 2017-07-21 01:30:21


Yes. We do not want enforcement of bip91 that includes 2 MB blocks, we want the segwit only. Therefore bip148.
In addition, running rushed btc1's code is insane.
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:54:38


What is?
@_date: 2017-05-15 00:07:23


If you propose even bigger blocks, then number of full nodes will go down (even prunned full nodes, because network use) - and with low nodes count it can start to be point of failure (even a simple DDoS).
Also, when users turn to SPV (because of network use), then they have to put more trust in the server they connect to, and also trust that it will not leak/sell their privacy.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:17:04


No, because:


No, activation of 2x is meaningless, it's not enforced by any of users nodes.
Here Peter explains it more

And I want full node on my computers with just ~150 GB to spare for near future.

@_date: 2017-07-21 01:06:09


No, that is the software trap created by miners team, the team that we are fighting to get SegWit.
Instead, run BIP148 nodes. Miners can ignore their signalling, activation of SegWit2X means NOTHING at all, only activation of SegWit itself is checked by nodes.

Force - as in that large chunk of users will stop accepting not-BIP148 (not-segwit) blocks (starting august 1).
And if miners see that their economical base starts ignoring them, and new chain forms, they would be economically pressed into supporting this chain where the users really are. Assuming the BIP148/SegWit chain is important enough and they realise it.

SPV nodes can feed you invalid information, or blocks created by miners could be in theory invalid (at least that's what claims).  They claim that as a reason to e.g. not run SegWit, but actually without SegWit also problem exists.
So best solution is to run a full node. A thing that big-blockers / bitcoin "cash" will have more trouble with.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:32:32
CSharp, really?
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:43:28


If you use SPV, then your spv server can't tell you certain coin you just got was not double-spent, while in fact it was?
Perhaps it requires cooperation of a miner, so costs around 30,000 $ per one invalid block (with many double spending etc) - but at certain point, if people use rogues SPV serves, it will start to be profitable.
For one example of crazy hacking, remember when a &gt;51% miner(s) cabal + a hazard website doing bitcoin bets, managed to scam and have unfair randomness (e.g. dropping a block who's hash would say that the "house/casino" lost, and doing another "random" block)?

So ban bitcoin paper wallets and such? Because it's off chain exchange of bitcoin ownership too.

@_date: 2017-07-24 21:02:43

Just fucking run a full node. How hard it is?
Not everyone needs to, but the big players should - so that no miner would dare risk separating his chain from the chain with big economical players.
And yeah on your phone for coffey and such, use SPV.  (Or maybe SPV and connect it to a trusted SPV server or such to be more sure even with it).
And this potential **problems steeming from choosing SPV instead a full node** - also **have nothing to do with SegWit** but they are just the known since years problems with SPV.
Same, miners can choose to "SPV Mine" and not really check blocks, this is the situation with or without SegWit.
But they will not, as such invalid blocks (that would fall to invalid SPV check) are rejected by rest of miners, because they know economical players will reject it and they will lose tons of money.
SegWit does not change it.

It means that Miners are only claiming they will support SegWit. There is absolutely nothing in blockchain rules to actually enforce that (in users nodes).


No - if as above miners will not follow up on their promise and simply not signal 90% support for SegWit after BIP141 is active,
then only BIP148 will forced them to do it.

so what - what that has to do with medium of exchange used?
you can rise or lower price, and then transfer given amount of wealth using gold bars, diamons, Yazid sex-slaves (like Islamists from ISIS), USD, liters of petrol, grams of uranium like Clintons, boxes of used AKs like russian generals - or what ever else.
This two topics are totally independent.
except in extreme case where during shipment value of money could drop x2 like Bolivar over few days  (but Bitcoin does not have that, it rather fluctuates, anyway no one brought THAT thing as a problem).
No one yet was able to show any example how choosing medium of exchange of wealth somehow dictates your export policy (low/high prices).


Hmm what?
Country (or whoever) emits such currency by selling notes (or better - digital tokens) with serial numbers, and if they emit 1,000,000 of it then they promise they hold in vaults e.g.
* 300,000 USD
* 300,000 gold milligrams
* 300,000 silver grams
* 100,000 of milli-bitcoins
If you redeem the token of currency then you get back 0.3 usd, 0.3 gold mg, 0.3 silver g, 0.1 milli-bitcoin . 
People should audit if country really has such reserves by seeing it all "at once" from time to time (very easy with Bitcoin).
I guess you could then say tokens  to  will be issued in paper form (harder to audit, but if you would see two bills with same ID ever then this means someone cheated).
Im not saying above is better then investing in Bitcoin.. well, it IS actually investmnet in BTC as country needs to buy the reserves. But just investing and holdig it by gov, or by the people, ofc is fine too.
How ever this is incorrect that
1) medium of exchange used would dictate setting low or high wealth price for exported goods - this is separate topic
2) that above couldn't be done for some reason

Not really - just look at the case of Covington Catholic student, who was accused of smirking at a native indian at political protest and them mass media - CNN and alike, jumped to dox and lynch him.
Turned out entire story was false and based on lies, now CNN and other leftist MSM (main stream media) are being sued for millions in harm they done to the kids and their family.
RT was one of the media that was more objective - simply by not joining the MSM frenzy.
After a week it turned out their balanced reporting was more correct, and anyway entire story was faked, and the native guy was a hoax kind of like Craig Steven Wright -  he pretended to be a Vietnam war veteran, but he was not;  he pretended he was attacked by kids - he was not.

Just read logical arguments, at the bottom there is source code and math, hard to argue with that.
Some things can be a preference in the end, e.g.:
* do you want miners (centralised over 1 country) to have large control over network
* or do you instead want people to keep miners in check against any incorrect behaviour by validating the blocks they mine - running a full node
If you want to validate and have more power - then you prefer smaller blocks, if you want to give up that and just trust miners, then you want huge blocks and run SPV wallet for everything.

I suppose most secure and private might be to
1) use full node, and use some wallet that plugs into that - this is possible on android - but maybe not so user friendly 
2) or probably easier:
on  trusted home computer run bitcoind, attach to it the electrumX server (perhaps listening over tor hidden-service address)
and on phone use Electrum and tell it to connect over tor yo only your electrumX node
If done correctly then both methods should be very private, and also secure as long as the divces are not hacked
as for very easy solutions, I guess Electrum is quite ok. Dunno about others.

If Bob decides to withdraw, then he either:
a) does it in honest (cooperative) way, tells Alice he wants to close, they both sign on it, Alice gets her money on-chain, and Bob gets his money on-chain.
b) does it honestly but not-cooperative: without talking to Alice he just closes the last ballance to onchain. Alice gets all her money, and so does Bob.  The difference is that they can use their ballances after waiting the configured (eg 144 blocks) time.
c) tries to steal - that I explained in other post here: if any of watchtowers sees it and reacts during the configured time (eg 144 blocks) then bob will lose ALL HIS MONEY from channel as punishment, it all goes to Alice. It takes just 1 of N computers to be online at some point during e.g. 1 day, and this computers can NOT steal your funds in any way. So it is really easy to achieve.
And Bob has no idea, just a huge risk to even try to do it.

If you open your node RPC to internet, then anyone with easy replay-attack (so your ISP, ISP of your phone using that node, or any ISP in between or hackers attacking them) can easily steal your nodes funds.
(Your node, probably not from the Samurai wallet itself).
Because Bitcoin RPC is not encrypted, and not cryptographically-safe authenticated.
Also this damages any privacy, as said ISPs (so also NSA, FBI and everyone) will see what your node talks about with your main node.
This was idiotic decission to use RPC like that.
They should just connect using P2P to own safe node, then all this problems would be gone. Or maybe you would need to run Electrum server, depending how exactly this works.
But telling people to expose their node RPC to Internet is a terrible idea.

 Do not enable RPC connections over the public Internet. Although Bitcoin Core's RPC interface does use authentication, it does not use encryption, so your login credentials are sent as clear text that can be read by anyone on your network path. Additionally, the RPC interface has not been hardened to withstand arbitrary Internet traffic, so changing the above settings to expose it to the Internet (even using something like a Tor hidden service) could expose you to unconsidered vulnerabilities. 


tyzbit opened this issue on May 8, 2018 · 0 comments
The Issue
As I understand it, if I am to use a full node with Samourai, I must also give Samourai full control over my node via the RPC commands. This means the wallet can:
    ban peers
    shut down the node
    adjust runtime parameters
This is too much access to give what should functionally just be a relay and block explorer. Also, if I am to use my own full node while travelling, I need to be able to access it which meains naiive users might expose their full nodes (and their RPC ports) to the Internet, or users must set up complicated VPNs for this functionality.
How to fix the Issue
Allow users to specify their own full node and communicate to that node on the standard Bitcoin port(s). This will protect user's security and privacy.

Liquid is not fractional reserve, it is cryptographically 1:1 pegged. How ever that is the system in which you need permission from others (part of a federation) to exchange money back.
In LN it is both 1:1 pegged, even better it is 100% exactly Bitcoin transaction - you just delay it - and also you need permission from no one to give it to miners to be onchain.

No. YOU are the controlling entity. YOU batch transactions. YOU submit it to be mined on-chain (when you want to close channel, or when Bob asks you to close because he wants out).
If Bob doesn't cooperate then YOU do it yourself, then you need to wait that set time e.g. 144 blocks.
Only difference with Bob is that if he DOES cooperate and you need money onchain for some reason, then with Bob's cooperation that can happen in 1 block (+delay depending on txfees you want to pay).

Only exception would be if ALL miners refuse to confirm that transaction in that e.g. 144 blocks (but this grace period can be increased), or when Bob would try to exploit Alice by submitting old chain state - which is easily countered by any watchtower (now they cost typically like half usd per 50 channels - or you can just run one or your other computer and also ask a friend).
And bob would be foolish to even try such attack because when any watchtower notices it, then Bob loses ALL his money from this channel.
Also, watchtowers are trustless (besides trusting that at least 1 of N will reeact) - as in they can not steal your money - so you can run them even on computers of people that you do not know that well.

It is not true.
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:22:07


Same as in previous reply here, you do not understand LN.  You do not know apparently that no matter what Bob does, is he malicious or hacked - still Alice WILL move her Bitcoins ON-CHAIN, even without Bob's cooperation or even against him, all her account she got in LN will be hers.

But it was 400 people, not 1 or 2 (1 or 2 is really a small sample size, obviously prone to random noise in statistics).

I live in Europe. Yes is correct. Over half of the countries are going totally to shit. This countries used to be quite safe, but that ended in recent years.
Stop just watching CNN and try walking alone capital or biggest cities in Germany, France, Sweeden or UK.  Some districts are still ok, but in some that is suicidal.

By definition.
Capitalism means Alice and Bob agree to exchange money (e.g. money for services).
In socialism money Alice is ordered to give up some money or to go prison for tax avoidance. She has no option to declining that. She does not negotiate with Bob what she gets in returns.

Well it's not a drink, there is no problem in listening to someone and then judging each ting on own merit.
As for running a fundrising platform, I think he will at least stop this abusive deplatforming of anyone not being full blown marxist SJW using funny pronouns. I hope they will use BTC and LN.

Actually the V4 countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia) are resisting the social engineering done by Marxists and the mass import of people hostile to our culture and to "western" life style (e.g. we do not stone woman who put out before getting married).
Migration will be probably there in part.
As for Russia - it really has lots of own problems.

* for you - it is important to run a full node to be sure you are getting actually Bitcoin, not some altcoin like segwit2x (the coin that tried to attack Bitcoin, created by former Bitcoin developer - Jeff Garzik) and for privacy (when used along with tor connection at least).
* for the Bitcoin ecosystem - if people with money are like you, that is run full nodes, or delegate that (e.g. to an exchange and they keep money in a web wallet) then this money is guarding the security of miners. It guarantees that miners can not that easily do tricks and produce false chain (that SPV wallets would see as valid chain).
* also it has some impact on p2p connectivity, avoiding simple bans (like national firewalls) and helps bootstrap new nodes that also want to start validating chain

Wtf are you talking about?
Are you on drugs?
There is no "entity in control of the system".

There are hardware hacks, one was monitoring power use on USB (now fixed), others are topic of upcoming defcon.
Can't have any side-channel in that case where it's offline (airgapped and more) anyway.

They are recommending a way of using node that puts the user at security and privacy risk.
Not sure why you keep defending such bad behaviour, maybe you are paid.


Samourai is responsible for their idiotic decision to use Bitcoin Core RPC over internet, while documentation clearly says to not do that, Bitcoin Core RPC is intended to be used locally - or if over Internet then with external good encryption, which Samourai wallet did not do.
It is their huge security and privacy mistake.

I hope you're correct, but we shall see. No one can *guarantee* such things (or they're being foolish)

Be careful, they are very far from perfect, or from being trustable - see 
Of course, Mycelium also was bad, with the huge delay and pushing some scam ICOs.
I guess Electrum is sort of ok? Last time I checked they didn't had [good? at all?] support for hardware wallets, but I hope it will be improved.

Bitcoin was associated with drugs etc - because mostly people rejected from other platforms must seek alternatives. Yes that effect exists.
Too bad, but we can work through it.

So anyone in every LAN / WiFi he happens to use, knows this guy has a trezor?
If that is so, then would be good to not do that call-home.

According to researchers and activists, countries typically associated with acid assault include Bangladesh,[35] India,[36][37] Nepal, Cambodia,[38] Vietnam, Laos, China, United Kingdom, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Pakistan,[39] and Afghanistan.
LOL - 10+ shithole countries, AND UK. Nice.
I hoped China would be not so bad in that regard, but I guess they counted it overall, not per-person, so China just being large is a factor. (Maybe also India).

Why it took so long?
Couldn't you at least clearly say SegWit is priority on roadmap, so people do not think you are paid off by bcash to not include SW, as BitPay is doing?
