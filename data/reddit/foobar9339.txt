The general rule of thumb is that if you have been compromised, you need to wipe the whole system.  Nothing can be trusted.  This isn't so easy to do on a phone.  If you think you might have been compromised, you should send your coins to a new address that was never used on the phone.  It's the only way to be sure.

Honestly, no one knows.  So pick a target price and go with that.
Also, make sure it's not an "error" coin where the text on the sticker says "casacius" over and over instead of "casascius".  If it is, you can actually sell it to a bitcoin millionaire for multiple bitcoins.

One question I had, are there any thresholds for when you need to report?  If for example, I received $100 in capital gains and am normally just filing a 1040-EZ, do I need to fill out a detailed 1040 just for that?  Does getting one cent in capital gains mean you need to report?

It could be a bubble, or the price could be rapidly accelerating to fit the actual price of something that has the same value as the world-wide supply of gold or a major countries currency.  I can't say which one it is.
But it's possible that this is like the big bang.  In the beginning there is an insanely rapid growth of the universe, then with time it slowed down.
If (once again I'm not speculating, but talking hypothetically) the true value of a bitcoin is $10,000 or $100,000 or a million dollars, we won't get there at a slow orderly pace.  That would take 100s of years.  There would be a rapid expansion of the price, but then it would slow down.

One anecdotal data-point, amagi metals always hits record sales and needs to hire temp staff to keep up when we hit record highs.
There are two kinds of deflation in bitcoin.  One is the block reward halfing.  This is predictable.  This encourages saving.
The other is the rapid deflation as the price goes up while we're in early-adopter/price-discovery mode.  This is unpredictable.  There's no guarantee the price will go up 20% every day.  Because it's not guaranteed, some people will take advantage of what they think is a high price or a top, and others won't.  But in this case, due to the unpredictability, you can't just assume that holding is rational due to deflation.  It's not predictable or a gimme.

Even if you ignore the price manipulation, diamonds aren't fungible so they don't make good money.
A two karat diamond is worth more than 2 one karat diamonds which are worth more than 4 half-karat diamonds.  If you break a diamond in half it loses value.  You can't just combine two diamonds into a bigger diamond, so they get exponentially more expensive as they get bigger.

Good advice, but I'd say not your own instinct.  Your own instinct backed by your own research.
You need to start with "Wow, this bitcoin thing is really revolutionary I should look into it."  Then you need to decide what you think it's worth on a fundamental level, not what it's worth because THE PRICE CAN'T DOUBLE EVERY MONTH.  You need to find your own numbers that show bitcoin is worth X if it's a replacement for paypal, Y for western union, Z for a new global reserve currency.  Then you need to decide how likely you think all these scenarios are and how much risk you're willing to take.
After that it's pretty easy to decide if you should buy or not.

If you bought the BTC at $5 it's an unrealized profit as long as it's sitting there.  When you swap it for an LTC, you've realized the profit.  $500 - $5 = $495 profit that's a taxable event.  Sell the 100 LTC for $500 no taxable event.  Sell it for $600 that's $100 realized profit.

Can you provide a more concrete example of how a futures contract would really help a typical merchant?
All futures allow a merchant to do is lock in an exact BTC price for a given window.  For most merchants this doesn't make sense.
I lock in a BluRay player at a price of 2 BTC for a month when BTC/USD is $150.  That's nice.  I don't need to update my website for a month.  But now customers will only buy the BluRay player when the exchange rate is $150 or less.  They just won't buy it when the exchange rate is $160.  Then they'll take arbitrage opportunities.  The rate goes to $75, they'll buy the BluRay player, sell it on ebay, send the money to dwolla, and buy more coins.
And if I don't lock the price, then I just need to buy a futures contract for each sale I make, in which case it isn't any different than just converting to USD the way bitpay does.
Now a future could be useful for something like butterfly labs which is more like the agriculture example.  Instead of taking pre-orders, you agree to a price at a given date and time, but don't pay until they're ready to ship the unit.  But in this case if the price of BTC goes up a hundred-fold a customer could just default on payment, so butterfly labs needs to get the coins up front anyway.
I guess a futures contract would allow you to lock in a BTC-only supply chain.  You don't need to restock your materials until a month from now so your supplier buys a future to lock in the price.  That's all well-and-good, but it doesn't provide stability, it makes the exchange rate completely irrelevant to your supplier, just as if one of you guys converted to USD ahead of time.
Also, once you get into options, volatility is included in pricing calculations.  Bitcoin is so volitile it makes options prohibitively expensive.

Well the actual encryption is AES-256, which even the NSA trusts and recommends for top secret documents.  So it's safe assuming you use a sufficiently strong password that you don't use anywhere else.
But, no offense, you probably won't choose a sufficiently secure passphrase because us humans are really, really bad at that.
It might also make you a target.  If a malicous actor sees a wallet.dat when your dropbox is compromised, he might try to target you and your machine in particular since he knows you have bitcoins.

Now on to learning about fractional reserve banking.  I hope your head doesn't explode.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:21:45
Regarding the algorithm:
1. The actual signature algorithm that is used to spend bitcoins is ECDSA.  The algorithm is published, has been reviewed, and is even considered secure by the NSA.
2. The bitcoin specific stuff, such as the reward of 25 bitcoins per block and difficulty settings, are coded into the client software.  Even if the creator wanted to make a change, he would need to convince the entier peer-to-peer network (or at least 51% of it) to agree to the new changes and use a modified version of the software.  If he just makes a change and no-one else agrees, he will start running a 'forked' blockchain, which no other users will consider valid.
Fluctuating value and volatility isn't great for a currency, but will hopefully become more stable over time.  At this point we're in price discovery and people are trying to decide how much a single bitcoin is worth.  The question isn't how much is it fluctuating now, but how volatile will it be and what will it be worth in several years.  If you think bitcoin will be worth significantly more in the future and be more stable, and another currency will be the same value or less due to inflation, you might want to get bitcoin now while they're (hopefully) cheap.
Bitcoin is backed by math.  This isn't completely accurate, but math secures the transfer of bitcoins, and math controls the supply rate.  This provides a base set of expectations that can be thought of as backing.
The pie-in-the-sky goal is indeed to be a global currency that is beyond the control of governments and central banks.  But even if it just settles for being a paypal competitor it will still be very useful.
Yes, it's hard to get into bitcoins now but things get better every day.  Think of it like cell phones in the 80s.  One guy sees a Yuppie bankers with one and complains that they're bulky and cost thousands of dollars a month and they only have a 30 minute talk time and you can't use them unless you're in the financial district.  Another guy says, "Yeah, but in twenty years they'll fit in your pocket, be affordable, work everywhere, and even your teenaged children will each have their own phone."  One of these guys bought stock in cell phone companies and the other one didn't.

A Ponzi Scheme is not something where early adopters profit off of newcomers.  If it was both Apple and Microsoft would be Ponzi Schemes.
And a few people brought up value creation, but that has nothing to do with the definition of a Ponzi Scheme.   Tulip Mania, in all of its excesses, never met the criteria of a Ponzi Scheme.  There was no Ponzi-scheme style fraud involved in that.
A Ponzi Scheme, by definition, is a scheme where:
1. Money isn't actually invested as the operator of the scheme claims it is.  It is fraudulently kept by the scheme operator.
2. Fraudulent profits are paid to early investors from funds obtained by new investors that also aren't actually invested in the method the scheme operator claims.
Neither of these two criteria are met if you buy and take posession your bitcoins:
1. The person who sold you the bitcoins actually physically (or virtually) delivered the bitcoins to you.  They didn't fraudulently take your money and claim that they're holding on to bitcoins for you.  You have them.  You posses them.  They exist.
1. When you sell your bitcoins at a profit, they are actually physically (or virtually) delivered to the person who bought them.  There is not a scheme operator who takes their money, gives you some, and just says "Okay you own bitcoins now" without actually having any bitcoins.

Right, but if you decide bitcoin is too risky you didn't 'almost invest'.  You made a tactical calculated decision that the potential upside wasn't worth the potential risk.
If you stuck with the S&amp;P 500 because it produces a historical average return rate of 8% and is more stable, and bitcoin hits (hypothetically, not a price target) $50,000,  then you didn't make the wrong decision.  You made the right decision for you at the time, assuming the stock market doesn't self destruct, and you got that 8% average return.
And you can't write off the person who put money into an extremely high risk investement that paid off as someone who just got lucky and you as unlucky.  They just made a different tactical decision that made sense to them at the time.

It's a practical matter.  It's not a hypothetical.  It's not ideological.  It's because many real people actually have been ripped off of large amounts of money trying to do deals with paypal or credit cards.
Yes, it would be nice if credit card companies and paypal changed their policies to make it easier to convert to/from bitcoin, but no one here has any control over that.
You can throw out the hypothetical gold example, but that just demonstrates that "In theory, there's no difference between theory and practice.  In practice, there is."
No one would complain if you were able to convince them to do so.  No one would complain if you started a business that sold bitcoins for paypal.  But chances are, in a few months, you'd be one of the many people screaming DON'T USE PAYPAL!
[I'm not trying to be all "Well if you want one, why don't you set it up yourself!!!" Just saying that people are speaking from experience. Today, given policies, rules, and regulations, it's a bad idea.]

Conventional investing 101 advice, which for legal purposes shouldn't be construed as investment advice, and you really, really, really shouldn't take investment advice from strangers reddit:
How liquid do you need the money to be and what is the time horizion to spend it?
1. If you need it in a year or two, you just leave it in a crappy savings account because it remains liquid and accessible.
2. If you're thinking 'well I'm going to need a new car in a few years' or 'college in a few years' (not sure how young you are) you invest in safe bonds so you don't lose money to inflation.  This makes the money less liquid though.  You might have to take a loss to get to it into an emergency.  And it pays less than investing in stocks or mutual funds.
3. If you're saving it long term, for say retirement, a safe bet is an S&amp;P 500 mutual fund.  This will return (on average) 8% a year which means your money will double every 9 years.
That's what someone who doesn't know about investing should do.
After that, you're trying to beat the market, and trying to pick something that outperforms a generic stock investment.  By getting a higher percent return than 8% your money grows faster.  But it's more risky as well.  You need to know about investing or you're really just gambling.
Bitcoin is extremely risky to the point where you should just assume any money invested is lost.  100% gone.
At the extremes:
If it was money built up through 16 hour days of back-breaking work, you probably want to invest it in something more safe and reliable.
If this is some inheritance money you got from your Great Aunt Hester who you didn't even really know, you have some disposable income in your budget, and you want to treat it as free money and let it ride, Bitcoin might be as good a gamble as any.  It has probably the biggest potential upside you could find, especially since you're not an accredited investor and can't invest in something like an internet start-up that will offer the potential of double-digit percentage returns.

So what you're basically saying is, the reason coinbase doesn't take credit cards is because they don't like making money. ;)
If anyone can build a system to do this, they'll make millions of dollars.  I can't quote specific rules and regulations, but I once again assume there are practical reasons none of the major exchanges of buy bitcoin sites take credit cards, and that they've at least done some basic investigation into it.

Two different issues.
Miners control the free-market rate.  bitcoin-qt needs to guess what will be a good match to the free-market rate via a heuristic.  They need to guess something that miners will accept.  This has nothing to do with setting the free-market rate.  It is an attempt at price matching between the sender of coins and the miner, so that you don't pay more than the miner wants or less than they'll accept.  They are not dictating what the correct or allowed rate is at the protocol level.

It's probably advisable just to buy bitcoins.
At the moment, there are many people who ordered mining rigs in the distant past, paid in bitcoins, and had to wait an extended period of time to get their miners.  By the time they got them, they couldn't mine enough bitcoins to recoup their initial investment in BTC, but still want some bitcoin so they run the rigs to try to break even.
Basically, because they got stuck with a sunk cost, they need to run the miner to get some of their investment back, even though in hindsight it would have been better just to keep their original bitcoins.

The lesson to learn isn't "I can't call the peak so I should sell now and not even try."  The lesson is not to got all in and all out.  That's still a **trader's** mentality, not an **investor's** mentality. You're always left kicking yourself because you sold too early or too late, and because you bought back to early or too late.
I'm generally bullish but am happy to take profit.  But I don't understand why you'd just sell it all now if you're generally bullish.  I setup stops where I cashed out some of my coin.  That way as the price kept going up during the last rally, I still had plenty of bitcoin to sell, I made back my initial investment, then some more, and still had plenty of bitcoin for whatever the future held.
On this upswing, I'm happy to have sold a small amount at 200, won't regret it if the price goes to 300 or 500 or 1000 and we never see 200 again, and will still have the cash if the bubble bursts and we crash to sub 100 dollar amounts.  And I'll sell some more if the price keeps going up.
But while it is going up, there's no way I'm going to be left with ZERO bitcoin to sell.  That's just crazy if you believe the ultimate value is 1 or more orders of magnitude greater than the current price, even if you don't think we're getting there this year.

I don't think it's a question of eventually, MtGox probably has a million dollar wallet.
This sounds counter-intuitive, but if you have a critical passphrase, you actually should write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe deposit box.
On one of the encryption mailing lists I hang out on, one guy fell off of the top of the mast of a boat, had severe head trauma, and needed to re-learn how to speak over the course of six months.  He of course forgot his gpg passphrase.  There was nothing important in this case, but it just goes to show that no matter how vigilant you are, you could end up losing your 'brain wallet'.
I haven't used it myself, but I hear armory also supports Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.  This lets you break a file into X parts, distribute them to different people, and require Y people to cooperate to put them back together.
So for example you could keep one part, your wife could have one, and so could your best friend, and you would require two parts to rebuild the wallet.  No one person can steal your bitcoins, but you do need to worry about your wife running off with your best friend.
(Then you could also distribute to yourself, wife, best friend, mom, and dad and require three people to cooperate so that even if your wife and best friend took off they'd need to get your mom in on the scam.)

They essentially sign off on a bunch of transactions so that they are approved by the bitcoin network.
If you believe in bitcoin, then this solves a useful societal problem because it prevents a single party from taking over the network and forging payments.

The proposed changes do let the sender and market choose.  It looks at the going rates by examining current transactions.  It then suggests a transaction fee based on the going rate and what you're trying to send.  You choose to accept the suggested rate or not.
The only thing that's centralized is the algorithm, but there's really no simple way for an average user to do these calculation on their own.  How would you come up with a rate right now off the top of your head?  You can't.  It's a hard problem.

Right now you can already buy or sell silver.
What you're proposing is that instead of peer-to-peer trades, everyone ship all of their physical silver to a centralized location so they don't need to go through the trouble of taking possession if they're playing the market.

Unless you're taking a briefcase of cash to another country, at some point in the chain of getting money from you to your bank to the exchanges bank to the exchange the AML laws will kick in.

So what is the optimal invesment strategy?  Buy low, sell high?  Fair enough.  Is the price right now low or high?  If I have $25,000 should I just buy now at $80?  If not, what price should I wait for?  Can you provide an actual concrete strategy and price targets that isn't simply, "Well be smarter than the market."?
DCA isn't debunked.  It simply isn't an optimal strategy, assuming your sole criteria for your strategy is maximizing profit.  But once we start talking optimal, we need a strategy that would have allowed someone to predict that $2.50 was the bottom and $266 was the top.  Who nailed that one?  What strategy did they use?  Was there a non-zero risk with said strategy?

I don't think anyone expects it to dethrone gold.
If you look at the reasons a stereotypical goldbug buys gold, it's because (1) they take physical possession of it, and (2) it's resistant to manipulation by governments and central bankers due to the finite supply.  You're taking control of your wealth.
These two characacteristics basically apply to bitcoin, so if you're holding gold for those reasons, you might be interested in bitcoin.

There are two theories:
1. The misprint coins are becoming actual collectors items due to an extremely limited supply.
2. They're being bought fraudelently, chargebacks will follow up, and the fraudsters will get the bitcoins.
Still, over on bitcointalk it seems you can sell the misprint coins for 4-5 btc because some bitcoin millionaires are nostalgic.  (Imagine the day in 2038 when that's on the Antiques Roadshow...)

Well in that case you can't use the traditional mining reward.  You can only generate a coin when someone has deposited $1 into the system.

I actually don't object to Bitcoin being called a fiat currency, but in this case it's value is determined "By Decree [of the people]" rather than "By Decree [of a single government]"
In that case the value is that it isn't controlled by a single government that sets policy to suit it's own interests.  It can't be used to impovish Cuba or Iran.  The supply can't be manipulated to suit a single central bank's policy, which changes on a whim.

Pirate is one thing because he stole bitcoins.
Other "early adopters" did do something of value.  They invested time, energy, and money on bitcoin when there was no guarantee it would be worth anything.  They bootstrapped the ecosystem.
The guy who bought two pizzas in exchange for 10,000 bitcoins demonstrated that they could actually be used in commerce.  You could argue that's not worth a 2 million dollar reward, but then you might as well argue that the Apple I was a really shitty computer.  It didn't even have a case after all.
Regarding deflation (which isn't exactly true, the rate of production slows down, but every year until 2140 there are more bitcoins in existence) by the time that the rate of growth of the number of bitcoins is less than the rate of growth of inflation/wealth, causing the value of an individual bitcoin to go up, the value will only grow at the rate of inflation.  ~2-3% a year is hardly a way to get rich.

Rather than call what it will be, I try to establish the floor.  What is the least it will be worth, not counting 0 because it crashed.
My back-of-the-envelope math...
Lets assume that Bitcoin doesn't take over the world and become a new one-world currency bringing up an age of world peace.
Lets assume it just corners one niche market, but does it very well.  Lets say that it becomes really good internet money.  That is, a worth competitor to paypal and paypal alone.
Lets exclude Western Union, credit cards, banks, world reserve currencies etc.
Paypal's total value of transactions in 2012 was 145 billion dollars.  (Source 
Now that's the max amount of money that was transferred, but that doesn't take into account money velocity.  Person A sends person B 100 dollars, person B sends person C that same 100 dollars.  That's 200 dollars in transactions.
Their revenue in the same timeframe was 5.6 billion.  This is the actual money extracted via fees.
It stands to reason that the actual amount of money that went into the system is somewhere between these bounds 5.6-145 billion.  Divide that by 21 million, and for that use case alone you have:
$266-$6904 per bitcoin!
Now with that as a base, start thinking about the value when it replaces other things like Western Union, Visa, Mastercard, international money transfers, etc.
TO THE MOON!.

Of course it's not.  But as the market cap grows it becomes more expensive and thus harder to manipulate the price.  It was much easier for a millionaire to manipulate the price at $1 than it is at $840.  You also can't **guarantee** successful manipulation.  You can attempt to manipulate the market and it can backfire.  This also becomes more expensive and risky as the value goes.

No, you just need a higher interest rate on the loan than the value of deflation.  How about a loan at 10% interest with deflation of 5%?
Why would anyone invest money in a high-risk startup company when they can get (on average) 8% return by just throwing money into an S&amp;P 500 fund?  Because some people want to outperform the market.
Its not unreasonable to think that someone with no capital will want it now, and someone with capital won't be happy with an growth rate that simply matches inflation.
