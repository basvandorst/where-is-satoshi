I bought my first bitcoin when it was still in double digits. Go fuck yourself, you don't have a clue homie. I've probably given away more bitcoin then you'll ever own in your life.
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:13:23
It was only like 50,000,000,000 wasn't it? Peanuts in this space.

Does your life depend on 10% of your paycheck?
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:13:57
Bullish AF!
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:06:00
Been here since double digits.
Still never know wtf will happen during these rodeos. Last night was the first time in a long time I sat in front of the charts cheering like a school girl. LETS FUCKING GO!
It doesn't matter when you got in. There is only 0.003 BTC to go around for every person and if you have 0.28 or more you already are the 1%.
Vegeta-bles to the moon!

Good story but 15 minutes? maybe to get out of the mempool.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:57:17
If this shit is going to scale and be used for anything beyond a store of value we can't be expecting people to bust out their fullnode on their laptop and check the mempool size.
I guess there is sites online you could use but the bitcoin I was selling was inside of the BRD wallet and their interface and feel selection is rudimentary at best.
I will try and consider that next time but I still don't think this should be a mandatory step for a p2p digital cash.

With the amount of meme's about moon today you'd think the price was actually moving.

He was willing to pay 70 pounds to the bank. He mentions a few pounds for a BTC fee. 
I've seen fees ranging from a $2 to $15 recently. Last time I went to the Bitcoin Atm near me it took 2.5 hours for me to get into a block and I had to leave before I could actually withdraw my money from the ATM. Had to then make another trip back on a different day just to withdraw. It was a pretty frustrating experience   
I guess I should have payed a higher fee?

Are you even reading the guys comment? He said 10% of his paycheck into crypto and he's also still tending to his traditional investments. Perhaps it's another 10%.  
Are you the guy that believes traditional markets will just continue to go up and up and up forever? At some point that ponzi scheme has to break. Hopefully your also hodling some sats at that point.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:32:31
Good chat. Not sure how this became about me but I digress.  
I don't disagree with you but I also have trouble buying into the "traditional" proaganda that it's sustainable for things to continue to climb for ever.   
Then again I bought my first sats in the double digits so meh? How much money does one really need?

I was actually reading a post from Omar that said the one thing he noticed as he reviewed peoples videos is that the majority of the ones being removed were ones that had referral links to exchanges or other types of things. Onces that didn't have such things were less likely to be removed.

Can speak for all browsers but inside firefox one of the first things I do is go to the three lines (top right or ctrl+shift+a) and then to gear icon (again top right) and untick the "Update Add-ons Automatically"
That being said I also really enjoy the following add-ons:
* [ublock origin](
* [disconnect](
* [https everywhere](
* [no script security](
Also of course DYOR I'm just some guy stuck in the mempool named Ed.

How do we expect the lazy masses to use Bitcoin instead of ZuckBucks though? 
Perhaps you are comfortable doing this and I am comfortable doing this but trying to explain that to my grandma is going to be quite the challenge.

I'd be happy to wager all of CSW's bitcoins that in 2099 bitcoin will be more then $5.00

Agree he's pretty bad ass for going long so ling ago I hope. Plus he's got all them silk road bitcoins!
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:39:37
He's talking about mining BTC. He literally has a plug right there. Why isn't there an asic plugged into that thing my dude? Missed opportunity here for utilizing free power from the arena!

Might want to look into what college costs now a days. I think 0.014 BTC is way over paying!
