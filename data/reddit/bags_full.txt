Yes, send me a PM. I could put you in contact with the right people depending on what you need.

Yes, generators have become a trend now despite the risk it implies to order them and worse if a thief/collective hears it and decides to take it by force from you. Tap water is not ok to drink, desperation escalated so badly with the country not having water that people had to drink from sewers.

I want to thanj you for you selfless and brave initiative to help my people, we sure need more people in the world like you pal. Well I would first advise you to be careful with crypto funding, most of it are scammers. 
You would create a more positive impact on our society with donating food and medicines. 
this is the only website that is verified that delivers food at the moment:
From there I know you can pick and choose where to send it. I know for certain the most dire ones are hospitals in Venezuela, all of them are having food problems and medicine (patients only get 1 meal which consists in a small portion of  white rice and black beans) 
 I know for sure you can send it to any Children's Oncology department where mothers and childrens would bless you for it.
Here is the address of one of the most important hospitals just in case;
J.M de los Rios in Caracas Venezurla address
"Avenida Vollmer, Caracas 1050, Distrito Capital, Venezuela"
In any case, you rock! 
keep making this world better friend.

Your statement is slightly incorrect friend, venezuelan here. Caracas does not have 24 hours of electricity, my area has 8-10hrs and there are still several areas of the country that have reported 2-3 hours a day including Zulia.
 Yes, it's very depressing and chaotic, many have taken to leaving the country through the border or contemplating suicide. Still, thanks for the space.
