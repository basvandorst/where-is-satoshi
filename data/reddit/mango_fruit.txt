"Why would you want to do that?"
... not just for testing or graceful upgrades of the core.
It can be a complement to the core, as well. A significant one. Not every good feature needs to be in the core if it lives perfectly in the sidechain.

That i wouldn't worry about ... if you've read the detailed description of courses "COMP-531 Digital Currency Programming" and "COMP-530 Cryptographic Systems Security", I got the feeling there will be quite a deep dive :)

Agreed. Unfortunately, many banks strictly speak only about "virtual" currencies.

This is to be expected and progressively more so when TPTB start to understand the technology. Wait and see what R3 CEV will come up.
Now, what was that old thing, that we don't speek of, yeah, Bitcoin, supposed to be? Oh, right, P2P. So what about that?
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:20:10
It is very simple: if they make a law order, you have to accept it. Or suffer the consequences.
Regarding "virtual" versus crypto-currency, I've had the same problem. But this wiki explains it nicely:
"A cryptocurrency is a particular type of a digital currency, and both are virtual currencies. The reverse does not hold, since virtual currencies don't have to use cryptography."

Same here.
The first course should start TOMMOROW and still no information as to when/where/how!?!
Also, I wonder how time consuming this will all be (being employed etc.).
@_date: 2014-12-12 06:58:31
Very nice idea!
It'd be great if you could state it clearly whether this is for developers already experienced with blockchain (you mentioned it is "serious"), or will you start for the participants who will query the blockchain for the first time.
Also, will it be by any means possible to participate remotely?

That is, IF you need or want banking as it is nowadays. You might as well invest your wealth to other things.
Why would an average Joe keep his money in a bank? To get interests from it? I doubt it ... I guess many people pay more for account costs than ever get back from interests.
To keep their wealth secure? That is a very expensive way of protecting few hundreds of dollars (taxes, bail-outs, inconvenient use etc.). Many many people live very good lifes "protecting" other's people money.
I'm saying, if you have some little money, can't you just keep it safe with cryptography and a little responsibility? ;)

Also, in banking, a scheme is a common term used to describe for instance a payment protocol. E.g. SEPA direct debits have two schemes: B2B and CORE. There's nothing negative with the word.

What's disturbing me the most is people in Cyprus losing faith in bitcoin, after what banks did to them earlier. 
Cyprus would be such a perfect garden for bitcoin to grow as an effective alternative to banks. But now, having been targeted with Neo &amp; Bee ads daily only to get screwed again ... 
Also, the first MSc study of digital currencies starting in Cyprus next month ... ow!

Wishing there was some global awareness campaign for U2F or some better way to inform people of its importance. Otherwise we will still be a helpless prey because we must use insecure services (khm, banks).

For instance, an election of ED never to be such a shock like this last one (not that I don't support you personally, it just came as quite a huge surprise to most people).
Second idea, when BF publishes goals it wants to pursue, make them public, don't hide them somewhere on the website no one would look, and then provide report on achieving them. Present THAT at conferences, besides usual stuff. 
Keep reaching to the community just like you did today. Don't be silent in times of some issues - that's when people like to hear you most.

The sentiment is still very biased (oh, the risks, the horror!), but perhaps slightly less then it used to be. BoE reports are much more open-minded then what ECB/EBA produce. Slowly, slowly, the choo-choo will come to the old, rigid and frigid EU bureaucrats, too.

Good read, I just have a comment regarding:






I am a bit tired of hearing about "old mainframes" ... not every bank still has dinosaurs in the basement. Actually, I know of some shiny metals chugging txs along.
2nd, local databases and networks will always be highly protected. Even if a bank would use blockchain, it cannot open all transaction details of every John Public, right? OTOH, end users protecting their own keys ... I can't wait to be in full control of my money and I'm ready to accept the responsiblities that incurrs. I am sure, however, that many people couldn't care less about protecting their keys, phones, online identities etc.
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:19:08
Decentralization and/or miners would _probably_ still be required due to security (mitigating single point of failure). Otherwise, imagine what an enormous incentive an attacker would have with only one target to attack.

+1 for Digital Gold, but take it with a pinch of salt.
Also, just go through bitcoin's whitepaper references and do some research about authors, it will be rewarding.
