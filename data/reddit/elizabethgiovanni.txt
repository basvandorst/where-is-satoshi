This is not true. Bitcoin doesn’t have to do anything. The market is quiet now because only true believers and people who did their DD are left right now. But that doesn’t mean it has to go to 1800 to start a new uptrend (and in truth, on the long term log chart, it’s still in an uptrend, which will only break around 4K. I don’t see it going below that level at worst). People who believe Bitcoin = 1800 before the next uptrend are not factoring in how far the market/crypto has progressed over the past few years or are people who just watched a YouTuber say this is necessary for the market to progress. Meanwhile, the truth is, it isn’t necessary and the people waiting for 1800 or even 3k will likely be left behind.

Please do some research on the manipulation of gold mining. It’s interesting stuff.

So you’re saying they’re going to maliciously include code to make their publicly announced DEX effectively a non-DEX? Ok...
I don’t even have any OMG, but take off your tin foil hat and think about what you’re saying. The code will be formally verified and sifted through accordingly by the community.

I don’t think it’s going to be a Bakkt token. To the end user, for all intensive purposes, it is BTC, only it is a credit for BTC, not physical possession (shifting the burden of managing/holding private keys to Bakkt). This centralized/managerial role played by Bakkt allows BTC to be used as a form of payment without all the fee/verification issues we saw last December—I.e., crazy transaction fees if BTC skyrockets again and/or likely a reduced lag time for the transaction to be added to a block.

I don’t, I prefer to get my info straight from the dev meetings and reports, but lots of other lazy people love reading and spouting things from these articles as if they were fact.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:54:50
Exactly. Neither one has to “win.” They will complement each other.

They’ll probably be the first major publisher to embrace blockchain-based gaming items/currency.
@_date: 2018-10-14 22:22:56
Facts. People falsely equate: everyone was talking about bitcoin to “everyone of those people bought crypto and got burned.” Imo, the last bull run put crypto in the mouths of the masses without 99% of them really understanding or thinking deeply about it. The next run will make those same people stop and actually think of the benefits and applications (I.e., bitcoin does not equal all cryptocurrencies, or also that crypto-“currency” is also not the sole purpose of all of these coins).
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:39:07
Agreed! They need to give more specifics!
@_date: 2018-10-23 14:55:41
That’s true but don’t act like a US stock market crash won’t bring the world stock markets down with it like it did in 08. That was the dude’s point.
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:14:49
They recently joined the Blockchain Game Alliance and have been exploring blockchain tech in the past.
I haven’t heard of any other major publisher publicly acknowledging an interest in crypto, yet. Maybe they’re exploring privately and will save it as an announcement for one of their games or a conference call, but that’s all speculation.
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:58:12
What chain will they use?
@_date: 2018-10-29 02:05:29
Nope. Punt to Feb. like all the last ones.
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:16:59
It’s more realistic to envision bitcoin as a reserve currency, and national stable coins to be built on ethereum (imagine that!).
@_date: 2018-10-14 22:28:46
None of those things are necessary to see 20k again. Even if every one turns into a short term negative for btc and crypto, the progress being done every day isn’t changing. The devs aren’t just packing their bags and going home because bakkt didn’t work out, or tether implodes, etc. Even if any of those things don’t go right for crypto, they’re nothing but bumps in the rode to mass adoption.

@_date: 2018-10-15 13:39:30
Or they are short and want to spread unsubstantiated fud. Every time I ask someone to further explain why the fall of tether won’t be a good thing for crypto and won’t result in a market collapse never gets answered.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:53:26
Could the company holding your gold run away with it? Can you go visit and see with your own eyes the gold you’re buying? Do you even know how much gold is under the earth surface? Do you have certainty that the gold miners won’t start mining more of it and deflate its price in the future?

It’s insane people still read and share the articles on these websites. They’re mostly all terribly written, have anonymous “sources” to back up their story, and are filled with speculation.
As a community, we should demand higher quality crypto news sources.

The sky is falling!!!!!!!
Btw, what are you talking about with “interest”?
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:52:46
Even if btc has only one use case (as a digital gold), it can reach 50-100k+. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:51:49
Yes and Bakkt claims it will 1:1 own the amount of BTC being purchased through its service.
Also, because they are a sidechain of sorts, they will process the payments of BTC in house and then periodically buy/sell to the main chain as needed.
@_date: 2018-10-08 20:38:42
Idk I haven’t seen any specifics about how the wallets are going to work (whether we can transfer btc into the wallets or if you can transfer the btc you buy from bakkt out of their ecosystem).
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:20:12
Lots of BTC scaling discussions lately.
@_date: 2018-10-19 03:07:35
You don’t think they were shorting all through 2018? At some point they will load and go long. There’s money to be made on both sides and no one can debate the adoption and potential upside on deck.
@_date: 2019-02-17 21:25:19
I 100% agree with you.

The recovery was delayed by the economy issues and wars in the early/mid 2000s.
Also, now, we all actually have a ton of great devices and tools to help us progress the tech faster.
This bear recovers much sooner than you and other doom and gloom momos want everyone to believe.
Until then, throw your feet up and accumulate.
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:56:06
So Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:12:16
Great so you bought a bunch of shitcoins...
Why no BTC/ETH?
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:48:45
The only way a twitter alternative will over fake twitter is if it integrates its decentralized service with twitter. Meaning, you have an account that posts to this decentralized service always, however, there is also an option that allows you to post to Twitter too (but people see what platform it was sent from).
That’s the only way I see Twitter folks migrating away from it.

Great, intelligent, and thought provoking response. Thank you for the amazing discussion. �� I’ll assume you have no logical response.

Hypocrisy. As a BTC holder and believer, you’ll have 0 confidence in the ETH team and vision and instead say ETH POS is a long drawn out unachievable thing, as if progress on the LN and BTC advancements happen all the time and overnight with 0 delays.

True, with MUCH shadier entities.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:58:00
But if they get to POS, what’s the argument against ETH then? 
I think it’s crazy to not hold BTC, but I also think it’s crazy to bet against Vitalik and co. that they won’t eventually get the ship to POS.

But all of your concerns are temporary problems for ETH that they are working to solve with Serenity. 
Do some research on your current issues and you may find that there are solutions coming down the pipeline.
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:17:13
So true. Use DEXes and buy hardware wallets people.
“Centralized exchanges in crypto act like old world stock markets exchanges. These are old world solutions placed on new worlds. We don’t need old style centralized solutions to make a trade. The risk of having these centralized exchanges take custody of your money is not only high, but unnecessary. One of the reasons why exchanges make terrible custodians is because it’s unclear if they are fiduciaries towards those who park their money. Custody should be a segregated function in my opinion. Most exchanges are not even insured. So you lose your crypto if the exchange gets hacked. Frankly, the trading world should be aware that they can make trades using non-custodial decentralized exchanges. There is no need to rely on centralized exchanges to make trades. Once the world is more familiar with this, there will be what I call ‘the great liquidity migration’ away from centralized exchanges, Sam Tabar, AirSwap Strategist, told me.””

If you think crypto peaked in 2017, you’re in for a very rude awakening in the 2020s. Lol.
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:30:55
Where you think it tops out at and why?
I don’t think it goes straight back there. It’ll take many peaks and valleys, but eventually ATHs are attainable. Crypto is not a less than 1T market cap asset class in 5 years. Not a chance.

Past performance doesn’t equal future performance, only informs it. Thus, all the crypto experts staring at the last halvening pattern/chart/set up will be waiting for it to begin, but once they see the run starting, if a little earlier than expected, they may decide it’s better to be in and bank on the halvening pump than miss the run entirely and get in when btc is back above $10k and eth is nearing $1000.
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:06:08
So the value/price of this tech will stay down forever and ever just because some shmoes want to short btc futures? No. It doesn’t work that way. It’s still a market and people will eventually stop shorting it when catalysts/adoption/demand dictates it to.

Why do you think it’s going to follow last cycle exactly? Everyone and their mother is expecting the halvening bull rally 6 months after like last time. Thus, it’ll likely happen earlier than the halvening this time because all the fomo buyers who will chase as they see price rise faster and sooner than it is supposed to, according to the script in their head.

@_date: 2018-12-20 17:31:16
Everyone is expecting a massive bull run 6 months after the halvening. So what happens when everyone knows this and is expecting it? There’ll be tons of fomo if people who are waiting for that set time period start to see the price rapidly increase.
Thus, imo, the halvening hype/bull run begins before the halvening and leads into it.
