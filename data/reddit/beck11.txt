Most would argue that if everyone agreed that violence is never the answer that this would be a more dangerous, poorer society?  I mean, I guess you're right, because that is what they argue.  Doesn't seem like a consistent argument to me.  But you're right, I don't know for sure.  We would have to try it and find out.  That is one of the main reasons Bitcoin is so exciting.  It's an opportunity to try it out.  If freedom turned out to be as much of a complete failure as the current system and there seemed to be a better idea then no, I would not still advocate it.  I am honestly searching for the solution that will offer the most prosperity and peace for everyone.

It is not arbitrary in the sense that if society were to adopt such an ideal the society would be a safer, more prosperous one.  Since I think that is the goal we should be aiming for, I again claim that this societal ideal is not arbitrary.
Government is the natural and spontaneous outgrowth of a society that has never known anything besides hierarchical power structures.  Government is a reflection of society's belief that we need someone in charge of and controlling things, and that such control is even possible.

No. Accepting money from customers who are voluntarily paying for a service is not stealing.
Just because the state sometimes claims to do good things that people want like clean the water doesn't mean that the market wouldn't do a better job.  In fact, it would, because the market is made up of competing entities trying to solve problems most efficiently to increase profits, whereas the government has no such incentive because it is a monopoly.

There's a perfectly good reason for a colluding member to break away from the pack. If everyone is colluding to charge $2/gallon for milk, the moment one breaks away and charges $1.90 guess who gets all the business? This is the nature of competition. You are competing for market share. If you can grab more of it by lowering prices to the point where the increased demand overcomes the lowered price, you will do it because it means more profits as long as there are no legal guns involved.
I say "legal" because yes, illegal violence is incredibly less effective at accomplishing its goal than legal violence. Illegal violence gets you thrown in jail. Legal (or legitimized) violence, like that of the state, gets you power.
Again, one entity monopolizing a precious resource still needs resources itself. It cannot function without cooperating with the rest of the market for the resources it needs. That's the beauty of a truly free market. It ties all of society's self-interest together so that my best interest is your best interest. Legitimized violence does exactly the opposite of this, pitting different entities' self-interest against each other leading to war and other incredible inefficiencies.
I'm not trying to "guess" anything. I understand the nature of human self-interest. This one entity that is effectively trying to enslave humanity through its dependence on water is going to find itself in a war against the whole of society. People are not just going to sit around and say "well, I guess we gotta pay this company exorbitant amounts of money for our water". They're going to do whatever they need to do for their own survival, and they're going to cooperate with the rest of society to do it, unless they believe that what this entity is doing is legitimate, which is the spell our society is currently under with regard to governments.

I do not want to be in control of the government, I want the government not to exist.  I don't feel the need to be in control of things.  I think that the problem we are having is that a lot of people do feel the need to be in control of things, and do not believe that real freedom could ever work, and are not willing to try.  Bitcoin is the laboratory for real freedom.  It is opt-in, so only the people who want to try real freedom need try it.  But, I do suspect that it will get pretty popular :)
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:25:06
They will. Human beliefs are everything in the free market. What prevents the rich cartel from becoming a government is the fact that people would not believe that was legitimate and they would not allow it to happen. Whereas, currently, with the government, people believe its use of force is legitimate so they allow it to continue to exist. Once people wake up and see that having a badge doesn't give you special rights no one will be able to get away with enslaving people ever again. It will be illegal because the people will believe it to be so and will make it so in the free market.

@_date: 2013-12-23 22:28:37
Absolutely. I want a competitive private company without the incentive to take advantage of their position of power to use violence to deter violence.
Although the laws may not be intended to cause violence, they often do. The drug war is an excellent example of this. Laws may seem to be written with the best intentions, but when they are written and enforced by an easily corruptible monopoly on violence, outcomes don't tend to be what was intended.

There is nothing free-market or laissez-faire about pretty much every market in the world today.  So when we get little tastes of it in the form of lower taxes and better protection of property rights it's not invalid to suggest them for use as case studies for more economic freedom.  I have not said that Singapore is economically free, I have said that it is freer in some aspects than most places.
Now, whether academics attribute the growth to more freedom or the things the politicians pass into law, entrepreneurs go there because they observe that there is more freedom there.

How does the company come to own all of the reservoirs? As the supply of purchasable reservoirs decreases, the price for buying them increases. So this will get very expensive and as soon as reservoir owners suspect that someone is trying to monopolize they are going to become very reluctant to sell. Now assuming that somehow we get through these difficulties and end up with a single supplier of fresh water, as soon as the monopoly starts charging overvalued prices people with other resources that the monopolist needs are going to cut them off until the monopolist is forced to charge what their product is actually worth. When someone in a free market tries to monopolize a resource and overcharge they are effectively going to find themselves in an uphill battle against the entire free market, which is simply not a winning proposition.

@_date: 2013-12-23 18:06:53
No, a starving person would indeed potentially resort to violence.  Society believing that problems are not solved with force does not prevent all violence.  What it does is prevent institutionalized, legitimized violence.  If enough of us agreed to stop using that kind of violence then that kind of violence would disappear, just the same way that the violence of slavery disappeared when people finally stopped upholding it because they realized that it was immoral.  There would still be violence, but it would be much better handled by competing private firms than by a monopoly whose incentives are easily distorted by bribes from big businesses.
People naturally cooperate when the incentives are aligned properly.  They naturally collude when incentives are aligned the way they are now.
Honestly, I'm not an expert on these countries, but it's true, the richest countries have strong safety nets and lots of regulation because we have never known any other way of doing things.  They might just get richer and happier if they did away with those things.
@_date: 2013-12-24 15:41:53

It's a hypothesis that when you stop legitimizing violence in society and giving special rights to people who wear badges things get better. Bitcoin will be the starting point for testing this hypothesis because it does not incentivize violence like governments do.
Just because things have always been the way they are doesn't mean they always have to be that way. We're headed for some major changes whether we like it or not. One of the many implications of Bitcoin is the obsolescence of hierarchical, centralized authorities. Like the government.

Yeah, I actually looked a bit into taxes in Singapore once and it was clear that they are much less significant than here in the US, but they are, indeed, a far cry from what I want (none).  They're still ahead of the pack, though, and reap the benefits of being so.

I think Bitcoin is still in its infancy.  It is too early to draw any conclusions about what the implications of this new technology are.  People did not get scammed, they took a risk.  Some of them learned that they took more risk than they could handle.  Others are very pleased with the calculated amount of risk they took.  This is what a new currency-technology market looks like.  I wouldn't call it a scam.
All laws created by a monopoly on violence are acts of aggression because they force the consumer (at gun point, though the gun may not be obvious until you disobey) to behave in a certain way that may or may not be in their best interest.
Are the people who are happy with the amount of risk they took somehow hurting those who aren't?  Is it the fault of the people who are peacefully chasing a goal, or is it the fault of those people who got in over their heads in a volatile new market that they didn't understand?  Please do not make the rest of us pay for the failures of some.  I am sorry that they failed, but I hope they learned something valuable from the experience and will do better next time.
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:15:37

But when I argue I stick to principles because the rest is just castles in the sky.

At one point people seem to have thought that space exploration was one of these special things that couldn't be provided by the free market. Then Musk came along with SpaceX. There are also plenty of private toll roads that work just fine. And now with Bitcoin we even have a private competitive currency. I think it's clear that one-by-one we are checking off the list of things that can't be provided by the free market and showing that not only can they be provided by the free market, but they can be provided at higher quality and lower cost. Why this is surprising when we are talking about competitive private companies versus a monopoly (the state) is beyond me.
The state has neither the knowledge nor the resources to provide us with anything. They simply have the power to force others to provide you with things, which rarely gives the best result, and leads to stagnation in an environment of no competition (how much has space shuttle technology improved since we went to the moon? Since Musk's SpaceX came into the picture that flat line has sloped significantly upward).

Ok, so let's say all the reservoir owners collude to raise prices. At that point a huge opportunity will arise for either a new person to enter the market at a lower price and take the market, or for one of the colluding members to go rogue and lower their prices to take the market from the colluding members. You just can't avoid competition without the legitimized guns of the government protecting a monopoly. If you're overcharging, someone's gonna come along and undercut you unless you're legally pointing a gun at their head.

The government is the largest, most dangerous monopoly of them all.  It is the monopoly on violence.  It is the monopoly out of which all other monopolies grow.  You cannot maintain a monopoly without aggressing against those who wish to compete for position in the market.  Even in the case of land.


Should it all be publicly owned?  The government should own all the land?  Or some should be privately owned and some publicly owned?  Or should it not be owned at all?  If it's not owned at all then we come back to the question of who is responsible for its care?  Who has the incentive to make sure barrels of hazardous waste are not being dumped into publicly owned water sources?  When people own things they hold stake in seeing those things flourish and create wealth for them.  This is part of what we are seeing play out before our eyes with the Bitcoin ecosystem that is rapidly developing around the original investment.  It is being built by the people who are invested in it, because they have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin flourish.  When people own things and have property rights, they have incentive to take care of and enhance property.
Out of curiosity, what do you mean by "natural monopoly"?

So the problem is that the government is in a position to initiate violence against peaceful people (drug laws, taxation, etc), where a private enterprise would have no incentive to do such things because their customers wouldn't put up with it and they would have no legitimate means of obtaining funding if their customers left. The government has guaranteed customers whose money they just take, whether they like it or not. There is no way to keep this monopoly on violence in check except with more violence (hence the 2nd amendment). If instead we stopped saying anyone has the right to initiate violence against peaceful people we would not have a megalithic monopoly forcing us all to do the things that are in its best interest instead of ours.

Sure, the government is supposed to be accountable to the people, but in practice it is clearly not. If it was we wouldn't all understand that politicians are liars who are just trying to get votes. If we held Bush or Obama accountable for their actions they would be on trial for war crimes. Instead, we give Obama the Nobel Peace Prize.


Yes, there is always power in numbers. But if the majority stops pretending that it's ok for them to impose their will on others then things would be different. Anarchy requires a change in consciousness. It cannot just be imposed on an unprepared people (like in Somalia). Minds need to change first.
Additionally, we understand from recent experience with insurgents that it is very difficult to apply fatal force to a decentralized entity. You have to attack individuals and you end up killing innocents in the process and not killing all the targets. We also understand this from the evolution of file sharing to BitTorrent and from Bitcoin. Decentralized means more robust. A centralized power will always have a very hard time forcing itself on a decentralized power.


That sounds nice but we have seen with our own eyes that this is a utopia. Governments are not transparent because that is not in their best interest, and populaces are not educated because that's not economically efficient for them.
As far as determinism, we understand that it implies that all future events were determined when time began since every event is merely the outcome of the events that came before. If this is true (which I currently have no way of knowing and don't claim to) why does it make sense to try to control the actions of others? We will not be able to affect results. If people change their minds and see that violence does not solve problems then that will be what was determined as the path of humanity at the beginning of time. Why is that such an impossible scenario to imagine?
P.S. I am not arguing with Wikipedia, I am arguing with you. If you wish to continue doing so, make your own arguments, don't just say that I don't understand something and point me to an article. My argument is that you don't understand these things as well as you claim to. If you want to prove me wrong you have to make arguments out of your own thought processes, not external sources.

By any reasonable objective measure the government is not accountable to the people. Politicians lie to us. About everything. All the time. And then they spend our money on wars we don't want, and inflate our purchasing power away from us. And we let them because we operate under the false assumption that they are a "necessary evil".
If you don't accept free will and believe in determinism then having a government makes no sense because no matter what it tries to do to equalize outcomes, they will be whatever they were going to be anyway. Government is an attempt to control our reality, which is in direct conflict with determinism.

Ok so you're either spending all your money buying out all the competition that pops up ad infinitum which will ruin your reputation, and only serve to push customers to the new competitors that pop up, so then you switch to spending all your money hiring people to kill your competition which will ruin yours and the killer's reputation? That business model only works if people think it's legitimate and allow it to continue instead of prosecuting you for murder. Unfortunately, it's exactly the business model of governments and people do think it's legitimate because it's the government, but the moment Walmart started doing it they would be held accountable for their actions.
For some reason people have it in their minds that everything the government does is legitimate. After all, it's the government, so it's here to serve the interests of the people instead of its own self-interest. There's no way an entity besides a government would be allowed to behave this way in society because they would be damaging the fabric of the very society in which they live, which would not be in society's best interest, nor the business' best interest. This behavior will only ever be in a government's best interest because people have yet to figure out that government violence is no more legitimate than violence carried out by private people.

So this is the "The problem with freedom is that eventually there will be slavery again" argument.  And maybe you're right (though that doesn't seem to be the general trend of the evolution of human consciousness to me).  But it seems to me that if people want to try it, they should be allowed to as long as they are not forcing their will on others.  And then we could know for sure, and that would be progress.

So because there is a lot of state intervention and their economy is still successful then less state intervention would be bad?  Their economy is still successful despite the intervention.  Not because of it.


I actually reconsidered my programmed socialist beliefs and came to voluntaryist principles.  But I appreciate the suggestion.

I don't trust the government that is removing more of my human rights and freedoms every day.  If you want to, that is your prerogative, but those of us who don't shouldn't be forced to.  We should have options.  Bitcoin is a great one because it is decentralized and therefore more difficult for an untrustworthy government to force itself upon.

Anarchy does not mean no laws. It means no rulers. The situation you just described with a gun company is exactly what the government does. However, the sole reason that the government gets away with it is because people mistakenly believe the government's violence to be legitimate and do not punish it like they would if it was someone without a badge committing the same deeds. When you give people with badges special rights you're asking for tyranny.
We should be aiming for equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. We all have the same rights. And if we don't you can count on the elite making the people subservient. This has been shown time and again throughout history. The worst atrocities have always been committed by people with badges enforcing the law, in the name of protecting the people.

So you can prove that government forcing people to spend their money in certain ways is superior to allowing people to make their own choices?  I suspect if you can that would end this silly idea of freedom.

Or we could let them actually be responsible for the decisions they make as free people.

I really didn't know what you meant, but I did suspect that the goal of the comment was to bash all of libertarianism in one hyperbole, I just didn't assume it.  I was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you might have been saying something that I was missing.
I'm still not sure why it's so unreasonable to suggest that it might not be a coincidence that Singapore is ranked highly by some measures of economic freedom and has the highest number of millionaires per capita.  Seems like an idea worth exploring instead of just completely writing off.

The same way everyone else does. If someone is building a business they are going to want to construct a road so that customers can reach them. At that point they will turn to the market to select a road builder. They will look at ratings by other customers and maybe do research by looking at the work of various companies and decide which is best for them.

Sounds great.  What's the plan?
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:13:58
That's true.  I guess then that we should have the taxpayer meet all our basic needs and then there will be businesses popping up everywhere?  Maybe that doesn't quite add up.

It seems like what you do is observe that a small amount of government has failed and caused misery and then make the point that more government is the best way to avoid these problems in the future.  There is the possibility that less government would be more effective at reaching your ends.  Isn't it worth a try?  Especially if you can do it opt-in so that only those who want to try it need to?  Or do you insist on forcing your conclusions about reality on the minority of us who disagree with them?
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:18:01
Absolutely.  I agree with you on that.  You know what offers the freedom from that worry?  Insurance.  Not stealing from other people.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:16:34
Arbitrary ideals like not forcing your will on others?
I'm sure that there is plenty of evidence of state-sponsored programs spurring growth (at least in the short-term) in the context of a society with a government.  The suggestion is simply that this does not imply that not intervening will not be an even better option.  But we're having trouble testing that hypothesis because people keep insisting on intervening in the affairs of peaceful people.
