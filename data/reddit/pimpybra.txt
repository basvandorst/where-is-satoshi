No shit?  I was there years ago, and thought I recognized it, thought of Port Jeff, and am now surprised how small of a world it is.

If you're using KeePass on windows, it can use a [Secure Desktop during master password entry, and Two-Channel Auto-Type Obfuscation](
It just isn't enabled by default.
Nothing is 100%, but I think it would help at least.

If you have the bank account, credit card, and personal ID verified, you can do instant buys (for up to 1BTC per week)
  
It's not much, but it's something to start with.

I'm with you man, I just bought my first .5 BTC today.  Cheers!

Yes, I've seen the 2nd error below on this subreddit, and Olaf from coinbase support comes on, fixes something, and says it's all good to go.
We can hope for the same.

This time it actually seems full-on DOWN, returning an Application Error, but showing a blank page for me.
If you do a view source, [there's this page]( which just says they're aware of an issue, but that's likely generic.
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:57:35


Dumb question: why is that?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:03:14


From [Digitalocean's pricing plans page]( it looks like their cheap plans only give you one core...
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:39:56


Can't you just create a Coinbase account and transfer the BTC from MtGox to there,a nd then cash out?
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:26:30


Doesn't Google Hangouts provide this?

I checked 2 or so hours ago, and the instant 'counter' was gone.  However, I just checked again and it is there again.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:20:06
Nice, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-12 18:07:56
Ah, ok that makes sense.  I was thinking MD5 and signature were the same, but obviously not. Thanks

Oh, I'm relatively new to the bitcoin scene, so I'll openly admit ignorance: what's this To the Moon guy?  
I see the little guy, but is that just speculation that BitCoin value will skyrocket and go super high?
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:12:04
I just bought with them for the first time a few days ago, after it took a few days to get my bank account verified.
I bough just a little bit, and I was surprised it will take 7 days to process.  Ok, fine, I can wait a little bit.  Then I went to buy more today, but I can't buy any more while the first one is pending!
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:30:08
I don't know.  In the past, they've 'yelled' at you with just a message/email warning you of the limits.  I know they've closed other ppl's accounts that have ignore those limits though.  
But you're right, you'd think that they would have some note in their system.   Maybe try to call back again and see if you get a different answer?
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:53:23


Ok, dumb question, but if there was a compromised version of electrum (or any software), couldn't the link/text for the MD5 sum be compromised as well?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:04:00
Ah, didn't know that.  Can you go into or call your bank and have them mail one?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:37:38


Not doubting you, was more curious if you got in with Digitalocean before they changed plans/cores/policies around.
I might give it a look/shot tonight, thanks.

Would you have exceeded the monthly number of savings account withdrawals as mandated by federal law?   6 per month, and for ing/capitalone all of your savings accounts count as one.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:05:47
I just did this for the first time today, and got $40 to avoid a fee, and test the system w/out much risk.  You have to do a cash deposit at a bank (Wells Fargo or Bank of America).  Got my BTC in ~2-3 hours maybe.
Similar concept at  (which I have NOT used yet)

I tried this a while ago, but on my POS laptop it isn't worth it, unless they made it run faster.   I have a Nexus S which is 'newer', but the SIM contacts are jacked up so it's a Wi-Fi only device.  I'll have to dig that out.


I don't even have 2btc yet, but ehhh I'm trying to save money.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:51:06
I think more of it depends on what you got that first btc for when you sold it at $530.   
I know with capital gains, if you bought that at 500, sold at 530, your gains are $30.   If you then buy at $200 even, that's the start of something new, and then if you sell that for $400, you've got gains of $200.
That being said, I'm nowhere close to a tax expert, just a little experience with stock in the past.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:03:00
I've used them twice, ben happy with them.

That 7 days to get your first BTC from Coinbase seems to drag on forever!  Mine just posted today, and I bought more, but hey, that's only a 6 day wait this time!
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:16:41


Booo!  I'm not familiar with coinsetter, but I was hoping to have a solid alternative from Coinbase.  I don't think I'd do enough 'trading' to make this viable.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:56:26
How did you tell you had it, apart from it crashing your browser and losing your tabs?
I feel like that recently happened to me.... hmmmmm I've been due for a fresh reinstall anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:55:29
Yeah, I've been using the VPS's for about a whole day now, and I've only earned 0.6 XPM.  That's using a mix of 2 or 8 CPU machines.

Well I have been looking to start buying some BTC... lower prices would help.

That's fair, or at least use more modern design guidelines.   I'm usually pretty bad at any 'design' aspect.
Bigger problem is my main phone is an old LG Optimus T with a small screen and Android 2.2, so I was just trying to cram what I could in the space.   I at least tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S Blaze, which made me realize I had to use DP/SP for fontsize so it's at least 'relative'.
The background is from the official App Widget Templates pack, so I got that going for me.

Did you ever get a reply from CampBX?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:35:26
I see that error, but I just created my coinbase account and don't have my bank account verified yet, so not that I can buy any anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:48:04
Well, it looks like they bill you at the end of the month, and now that 11/30 is over for them, they have an invoice for me where I owe them $16 for services.
So if you've been running many hours with the many processes, check  - you might be in for a nasty surprise.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:02:07


I got the 2fa code on my phone, but when i put it n, it said it was invalid!  The login was very slow, so they're just getting hammered.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:10:18
I waited 7 days, and I got mine maybe 30-45 minutes after their estimated time today.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:51:46


Can you just print that to a PDF and send that to them?
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:55:32


Dumb question: why is buying BTC at Gox bad?  Is it because their prices are high compared to other sites?

Of course, you can easily 'avoid' this security risk by changing your bank password to something, using that for instant verification, and change your password again (either to your original if they let you, or another new one) once you are verified.
Also, depending on the bank, they don't always ask for a user/password.  For Capital One 360 (previously ING Direct), they ask for a unique ID that CapOne360 can generate for you, specifically for external bank access.  This is how Mint.com can access your CapOne360 account.  Again, you can verified, and then revoke that ID, and generate a new one for your needs.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:56:43
Ohhhh, I thought it was literally asking "blank" like it was some weird pattern recognition.
I just completed my verification today, after 3 prior attempts, so yeah I know what you're talking about now.
