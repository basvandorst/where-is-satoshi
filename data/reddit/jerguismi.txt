Or debt instrument &amp; fractional reserve. Also it might be that in wars the people haven't voluntarily adopted fiat, but because they haven't had an option for anything else. Bitcoin doesn't make it impossible to force fiat on anyones throat. For example in my country bitcoiners are already forced to pay taxes on their bitcoin transactions in fiat to governments -&gt; creates demand for fiat.


I don't think welfare is ultimately a bad thing, in fact I think in rational society it makes sense to pay the poor so they don't resort to aggression.
Of course almost everyone wants to end wars, I don't have any solutions for that. I'm just saying that the "bitcoin will end wars" sounds quite dubious to me, and I bet will sound like that to 99% of normal people as well.

Segwit doesn't increase the blocksize. It allows separating the signatures outside of the chain. The block size limit as it is currently understood will stay, segwit just allows cramming more stuff to a block. Of course you need to store the signatures as well out-chain. Can you stop spreading bullshit plz.

Well, later bitfinex can buy them out of the market with their profits. I think it is better to have something instead of nothing. Now you can trade those tokens with someone who believes bitfinex will pay. It is better than not being able to trade those.

The question is "what would be the best way for bitfinex to compensate their customers and continue forward". Whether bitfinex is illegal, scam, run by crooks or operated by jewish reptilian overlords is totally irrelevant to that question.

Well he kind of left bitcoin already in 2011... There were lots of talented developers flocking to bitcoin, so if you wanted to have a say in development it was probably better to move elsewhere. I think the same effect happens when founders leave startups, when things become too bureocratic.
AFAIK he isn't ripple developer, but they plan using ripple for something in their current company.

Well you can work with probabilities, similarly as with coinjoin. The transaction amount on monero blockchain seems to be quite low so that also increases the research surface. Of course depends on the single use-case how well identifiable the transactions can be.

@_date: 2016-08-17 11:34:09
Whether it makes sense or not depends quite heavily on the transaction volume. Credit cards etc are a lot of hassle, but if 99% of customers want to pay with that method, you are willing to deal with it. However even if bitcoin is only a little hassle, it doesn't help much if only 1% of customers is willing to pay using it.

With what logic you will make any money that way? The fact is that 60 million USD of customers money is gone. There is no way they can make that missing 60 million appear somewhere magically. The only way you can win as a customer is trying to gain advantage over other customers (debtors), and I don't know if suing is a good way to achieve that.

I'm not commenting on whether it is bad or good. But I think it is quite universally agreed, that fractional reserve makes money supply look bigger than it actually is. Banking is also a business type that seems to consolidate, so when there is strong centralization it is easier for governments to get involved. So I would say fractional reserve banking increases tools for governors.


Nah, I'm very old bitcoiner so I've heard this same stuff a lot from libertarian bitcoiners. Just this time decided to put up my two cents, usually I'm just listening.

I didn't have any funds in bitfinex, thank god... I'm just observing the comments here. To me it seems like whatever bitfinex would do, people would still be angry.

Not much companies in the same situation, though? It is quite rare to lose this kind of sums. I guess the only ones in bitcoin are mtgox, bitfinex and maybe bitcoinica. There have been some smaller services hacked, I think in majority of those you lost 100% and don't have a change of getting the money back.
I don't know if mtgox ligitation was much better for the customers. I don't know if still people have gotten any funds from there? I doubt it. And even then, I doubt they will receive very much. Lawyer bills etc pile up and eat half from the assets. Anyway, I would be happy to receive 70% this week, instead of 50% after 4 years.

"there is no prior history"
That is just plain bullshit. There has to be history to be able to avoid double-spends. Monero still has inputs and outputs in the transactions. However because of ring signatures tracking the coins is more difficult. I still wouldn't say it is impossible. I'm not that familiar with monero so I don't know exactly what could the possible pain points be, but I'm pretty sure it isn't a perfect system.
But anyway your "no history" claim is just proven bullshit by visiting monero block explorer: 
@_date: 2016-08-29 08:00:09

Hmm, I'm not so sure about the logic of this article. Proof of work, cryptocash, and ideas like that have been around for quite a long time. Hashcash was proposed in 1997. In certain circles these ideas have been circling around.
"Look, Nick actually laid down all the ideas necessary for a functional system: proof of work for scarcity, need for secure decentralized title registry, smart contracts. All pieces of the puzzle were there, just not arranged as needed."
Well... In my experience in software dev, ideas don't have much value, but practical, usable implementations can have tremendous value. There is always a lot of ideas floating around, and most are just worthless without execution.

Well... As far as I know, bitcoin has fees as well. But of course everyone has free access to it, so in the long run it might be cheaper. Who knows.

Equity? Do you mean the shares of the company? For them to be worth anything, they have to be running the business.

@_date: 2016-08-15 12:42:57
Depends on what that exactly means. With bitcoin I don't need to check on system level on nothing, once the transactions have confirmations you have the funds. And if you sent erroneously there is no way reversing that transaction. You can mostly focus on other aspects of the trade, and you need to worry only a little about the bitcoin transaction.
With paypal for example you need to be careful also after the transaction, because the sender might attend chargeback or could have usen stolen funds. Less optimal IMO.
With LN I have no idea, since the system doesn't exist yet...

For small amounts exchange might be better, since the bitcoin network transaction fees might take quite a big part of the savings. For example, if you buy $50 worth of BTC from exchange, you first pay withdrawal fees to your wallet. Then when you want to sell, you have to pay bitcoin network fees when you deposit the funds to exchange. Those can easily be in 10$-30$ range nowadays and might cost considerable portion of the savings.
Instead if you hold an amount like $50 in the exchange, you don't need to pay the fees to move the bitcoin to and from the wallet. The whole picture is quite complicated and there can be many risks.

Also, we can think about the scenario where Bobby is having his own chain and the other exchanges are having their own. Let's call the chain with &gt;1MB blocks chain A and the other B. Miners on the chain B can sell their coins on bobby's exchange, and receive fiat. However, when arbitrators buy on bobbys exchange, and to try to transfer the coins to other services, they will fail.
So, if Bobby is the only exchange protesting, he would hurt his customers pretty badly, and I wouldn't see the situation working very well for him. No matter even if 80% of the miners are supporting them. As long as there is some amount of miners supporting the chain A.

Who cares, when they can't sell their mined coins from the wrong chain on any exchanges, they will quickly switch to the BIP101 chain.
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:36:15
Assuming a scenario where coinbase, bitstamp and other exchanges would switch to BIP101, why would I do that? If only let's say 30% of miners would mine on the &gt;1MB chain, blocks would still be made and transactions would still be confirmed, just a little slower.
It would be inconvenience for a while, but it wouldn't be the end of the world. The transactions would still go through, and within a time the difficulty would readjust or more miners would join to the &gt;1MB chain.
The miners mining in the old chain however would be fucked. Exchanges wouldn't accept their freshly mined coins, because they are in the wrong chain. So they wouldn't be able to convert their "btc" to fiat, pay their expenses etc. I think they would switch to the exchange-ruled chain pretty quickly.

I'm not sure about that. There are people who complain about miners fees. But, that crowd is very minor, majority of bitcoin users I know couldn't care less. They care more about bank transfer fees, trading fees, etc. Those are usually way more than miner fees. So no rational person would complain about miner fees, but instead focus on other financial fees that they are paying, such as service fees.
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:46:35
I think the influence  of bitstamp + coinbase is more than btcchina's. Of course everyone has very strong incentive to be on the same chain that the majority is.
However, the point was that the miners opinion is worthless. Consumers don't care what is the "longest chain". By the same logic people would switch to the altcoin if it had more processing power than bitcoin - doesn't make sense really, does it?

Nah, practically all banks do fractional reserve. They are not illiquid or insolvent, that means a different thing. When bank does fractional reserve, it can have for example 50 times more debt (deposits) compared to its assets (central bank money). It still works because their assets never go to zero. Illiquidity event is when a bank has zero assets, and can't do basic transfers to other banks.
In cryptocurrency world, it is the same situation but in addition to central bank monies there is altcoins and bitcoin. Which is similar asset, except nobody can pull it out from thin air. So if illiquidity hits you, there is no one who can save you. So you have to be much more careful if you do fractional reserve with cryptocurrencies.
At least that is the common definition for illiquidity/insolvency AFAIK.

Well to be exact it isn't 75% of miners, but having 75% of BIP101 enabled blocks in the latest 1000 blocks. So yeah, it means that some amount of miners are needed to be mining those BIP101 blocks.
But this is more like the merchants giving the power to the miners voluntarily. Other kind of rule could be setupped as well.
In that sense it is true that it is difficult to see BIP101 taking off. I hope some alternative blocksize-increasing BIP comes in to play.

Satoshi was not perfect genius and didn't think through every single problem that there is. HD wallets have been under development for quite a long time, but bitcoin core develops slowly. And of course, you can create pull request yourself if you think it is a big enough problem. Or use other wallets, which are HD wallets.
(Meanwhile, raising the memory pool default is probably one-line change, and would take something like 10 minutes. Developing the HD wallet is a lot more work and requires a lot more testing.)

Probably the relevant classification is whether the activity is business-like or not. If you sell some saved coins to cover your personal expenses, or sell bitcoins that you get as salary, it is probably slassified as a personal sale. However, if you trade back and forth, making arbitrage etc, then you highly probably classify as a business. (Disclaimer: personal guess, do your own research, etc).

As I understand, the dispensaries can't get bank accounts. So they could be interested in having a service, where they instead have the cash in BTC (of course they fear the volatility risk). I don't know how they currently handle the cash. Maybe also offer additional services, where the dispensaries can tie their btc to other assets.
I'm pretty sure that most of the customers aren't very eager to pay with BTC on-site, so that is a more marginal problem.

Similar risks than with depositing your fiat to a bank, and getting interest. Of course bitfinex is something like 2 year-old company, run from hong kong, and little is known who owns it etc. Your bank is probably 100 years old, run by well known people, publicly traded etc.

Yeah, but regarding this single change they are promoting... Of course other scaling work can be done as well.

Remember also that chinese exchanges have their 0% fee, which skews the volumes. And many ppl doubt the validity of their data otherwise as well. So it is not really comparable.
"To be clear, if the majority, and by majority I'm talking 95%+ of the hash power is not going to adopt BIP101 and the majority of exchanges, that account for 90%+ of the global trade volume are not going to switch, then pray tell, how are you going to convince the protocol to change?"
Why are you talking about hashing power again? I agree with you, majority decides. But the miners don't. I don't see why a rational miner wouldn't just mine the chain that brings best profit. And with that you have the liquidity requirement - you have to mine the chain that is worth something. It doesn't matter if the chain you mine has the most processing power, if the exchanges won't accept it.
On the BIP101 topic, I haven't researched it in detail. I will personally convert my nodes to BIP101, and have heard from the exchanges at least bitstamp and coinbase supporting it. Maybe others oppose it, but I haven't heard about that. I see only a little risk converting the nodes to BIP101, because it won't activate the &gt;1MB blocks until there is 75% mining power.

The debt instruments you have at coinbase are still tied to btc (if you wish). Normal banks don't allow that. I see benefit for myself for not having to use any fiat-tied instruments.

Well, might make sense. In that case they are creating the invalid transactions to practice a ponzi scheme. However I don't understand why to create massive amount of invalid transactions for that, they might as well say "our updated KYC, AML and other security policies require up to 2 week withdrawal times for certain bitcoin transactions" or something like that.
I personally believe that gox is having liquidity problems on the fiat side, and is using similar tactic to delay fiat withdrawals. There is also evidence that much fiat has been confisticated from mtgox. However I don't see why they would have liquidity problems on the bitcoin side, unless some of their employee has been stealing the coins.

You can quite easily find buyers/sellers who are willing to pay for example 5% premium on services like localbitcoins or OTC markets. However, most people don't go through the hassle of putting the advertisement, because it requires extra effort to be the market-maker. The fees are there because the services charge for the effort.

Hmm, seems like social engineering scam. If you use the escrow, you don't need to provide the bitcoin address to the seller, and it works like automated system.

If you fear that the price is going up, you can hedge on bitfinex. The rate per one month loan is around 1,2%, if I calculate right. So if you think that the price rises considerably above that, it makes sense. Then when you receive the paycheck, you can buy the coins and remove the position.

This is like saying "it is not's golds fault that it can be filled with tungsten"... Well, technically of course abstract things like bitcoin and gold can't be blamed. But if gold is bad tool for something or bitcoin is bad for another thing, then you can say in common language "fault", I think.


I think this claim is simply false, or at least heavily disputable. Currently bitcoin software is still very difficult to use, and many people use exchanges for storing their BTC. Also it is quite common to see "I lost my BTC" threads here, so on practical level losses seem to be happen.

Well, it could be made as well with traditional credit cards. However no credit card company would allow you to build that kind of thing. With bitcoin, you don't need to care what the payment processing companies think.

I'm very well aware of that. You don't seem to even read what I am talking about it. Of course it is very easy to prove that the exchange has certain amount of BTC, either by singing a message or by moving the btc. However, with *the balances in internal accounts* it is impossible to prove either way, no matter the tech involved. I don't believe you even understand the problem space here, but you still throw around unsubstantiated claims.

Mpex isn't that big actually. For example their trading volume today is 804 BTC, and 698 BTC from that comes from S.MPOE stock. Means that 86% from their volume comes from _trading their own stock_. To me this sounds ridiculous.

You really have quite a strong bias, and I'm myself bitcoiner. The fraud detection/prevention from coinbase and circle doesn't protect the consumer, but the business of coinbase and circle.

The problem more generally with SEPA transfers is that it is nothing new. Essentially everything coinbase is offering in europe has been already there for quite long time.

Now coinbase offers SEPA trasfers which have already been there for long time, but with limits, lol.

It is always very safe to buy, because of the escrow. However it is not always safe to sell, because all traditional payment methods can be reversed (some easily, such as paypal, some are more difficult but still possible, such as bank transfers). So if you are selling your bitcoins on localbitcoins, always check the reputation of the counterparty.

How can you know that? As far as I understand, there is no theoretically solid way to prove that.
Of course there are audits, but I think there can't be one which is 100% bullet-proof.
For example, all the Chinese etc exchanges have provided more than 100% reserves. They provide list of internal accounts to the auditor, and compare that to bitcoins on cold wallet and hot wallet. But how does the auditor know, that the list of internal accounts is valid? There could be some ways to proof something, but the service could quite easily just leave some accounts unlisted, and there would be no way for the auditor to know that.

The bank they use most definitely is doing fractional reserve, because all traditional banks do fractional reserve. When they "hold" USD, they actually have debt USD assets from their bank, not actual USD. So because they are working on top of a fractional-reserve bank, they are themselves also subject to fractional reserve banking.
However, they can also very easily just own these USD-debt-assets less than they owe USD to their customers. AFAIK coinbase doesn't report their USD balances etc publicly, and don't do audits on that side.
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:02:32
So? People have probably also made big wins using margin trading.
Of course everyone should know, that margin trading is very risky (I already said that already two times in the howto). But what is life without risk? Boring shit, if you ask me. Of course it is up to personal preference. At least it is smarter to gamble in an exchange, than to gamble using satoshidice or some other gambling game, where you are surefire to lose money. And you also don't need to gamble all your savings, personally I'm betting less than 2% of by btc holdings.

The hard cap is artificial, as is Bitcoin itself (and the 21 million cap). However as far as I understand, raising the cap required hard fork, which is not trivial.
Anyway, whatever the cap is, if transaction volume goes up I suspect transaction fees will as well. I myself don't see this as a problem - essentially the user is paying for a storage in a distributed ledger, and that shouldn't be free (every node in the network stores that information).

Well, I'm the founder of localbitcoins. For localbitcoins it took about a year for it to start making money, and it has been profitable after january 2013 (and of course at the beginning not many people believed in the service or business model at all). Because we also utilize the escrow model, I think it is viable and I also can estimate somewhat how this kind of service would work.
I'm very busy at my current job at localbitcoins, but I think this service idea is good so I wrote it down here for others to get inspiration from. I think developing really basic MPV would start from 2 weeks to 1 month from me + some freelancers from elance. The development time of course varies depending who is doing the work etc.
On localbitcoins our escrow fee is 1%, on this kind of service the fee could be easily something like 15%, since the service itself adds much more value. Also you could compare the prices to local escort services.
Server costs are at the beginning very small, since you don't need much capacity to handle the miniscule amount of users. The good thing is that the revenues grow (hopefully) with users, so you should have money to invest in the service when the userbase grows.
I would guess this kind of service could start making money in about 2 years. It is not sensible to calculate ROI for this kind of project IMHO, however it could be explosive if executed succesfully.
The most tricky part would be marketing. I think at beginning 1) look at area, where bitcoin is used most 2) try to employ local escorts to use the service. I think bootstrapping the idea would require you to be escort yourself and sell using the service, or some good connections.

Well it can be a trade between the inviduals or invidual-to-business or business-to-business, and in each case be perfectly legal. If the counterparty is business and trading over certain volume a month, it should pay the GST/VAT if applied, do the necessary compliance etc. In Australia the legislation is a little bit stupid, because it favours consumers doing small transactions between each other, instead of the businesses. Estonia and Australia are the only countries where I've heard that GST/VAT is applied to selling/buying bitcoin.
Anyway to my understanding for consumer-level transactions it is always legal in almost any jurisdiction out there. Except maybe some countries like Venezuela, Bangladesh etc where often this kind of legislation is not enforced in practice.

@_date: 2014-02-02 14:22:18
Well, it is quite possible to cause this kind of problem, even without any fractional reserve, depending on which kind of setup do you have.
For example, if you have 2 separate bitcoin daemons running, with some subset of same keys (there are legimitate reasons for that), it is quite easy to cause tremendous hassle for the service by spending the same outputs simultaneously. The other bitcoind created failed transaction, _without knowing that it failed_. This results in an unspendable output for the change. Then the bitcoind does additional transactions on top of that undpendable change output, because it allows spending change outputs with zero confirmations. This can result in a massive amount of invalid transactions in a web wallet.
The fix? Add some option to the core bitcoind, that disables creating _any_ transactions with less than 1 confirmations. The zero confirmation tx's are desirable for small, personal wallets but can harm web wallet operators tremendously.
(Disclaimer: I don't know if the thing that I've described is happening with gox, it is just a theory.)
Additionally: the fact that a web wallet is creating invalid transactions is not a very strong proof that the service is practising fractional reserve banking IMHO. Majority of the coins are in any case stored in cold wallet in any sensible service, and it is quite easy to do fractional-reserve without it any way affecting the main operations/wallet of the service.

You have them in paypal, which is the same company AFAIK. It is basically an escrow, just so fluent interface that it doesn't look like an escrow (disputes are done via chargeback).

I just think the risks have been stated numerous enough times, I personally state the risks 2 times in the OP. It is clear that the people trading with margin are gambling. Now, what about letting them lose their own money freely?

I think bitpay rates look quite fair. But to be honest, I never actually checked them while buying them, I have just trusted them.

Thank god no one forces you to use their business. It is pretty common for escrow-offering sites to enforce this kind of rule, and I'm OK with it. Never had any problems. And you don't need to store all your funds there, just the amount needed for the trade.

But that said, I implied in the OP that the problems are probably legal, so no need to iterate that point ten times.

Yep. However the ATM prompts if the code printed properly or not. We might fine-tune that process.

It is still useful, because of their massive merchant/user-base. People just complain about everything, which is there mostly because of network effects. I'll guess after Bitcoin is mainstream, they'll complain about it (naturally). It is just that changes are slow on any kind of innovations which rely heavily on network effects.

I don't see much point for day-to-day transactions, unless you regurarly buy cars etc. As the article states, doing transactions is still a hassle, so unless your security/convenience preference is really high, you would settle for something more usable for day-to-day transactions.
For cold storage, however, this is perfect.
@_date: 2014-09-09 08:44:47
Well, whatever the participants decide to do is not dictated by the service. Maybe they could as well change the escrow amount and discuss about specifics before meeting.

No. The merchant pays the fees. The merchant makes the decision about accepting amex, eg. the fees are something in 5%.
The merchant can of course raise prices for everyone, but the price is usually the same whether you pay with visa, amex, cash etc.

I think you don't understand the problem well enough. Yeah, if you sell flower deliveries online, it is very likely that chargebacks are less than 1%, because what does the scammer do with flowers? However the more hard and quick asset you sell, the more fraud will happen, and bitcoin is the hardest and quickest of all forms of assets. Except big, big problems if you are selling fungible, almost anonymous, valuable stuff with credit.

Why would autonomous devices have different economic rationale than humans? They would also need to spend resources efficiently, even more than humans. If putting mining chips on human-operated devices won't make any economic sense, I'm pretty sure it would make even less sense on autonomous devices.
This bullshit 21 thing is just about "imagination" people waving hands on some stupid uneconomical ideas. To me it looks like just greate VC scam, or the actual business model is something entirely different that they actually describe. Such as putting those chips on household devices and leeching the electricity from consumers, and keeping the mining profits in the company.

@_date: 2015-05-18 09:13:03
What does the GBTC annual fee mean? Does it mean that if you own GBTC, they will lose value compared to BTC, or what? The XBT model is nice, because the fee is in the market maker spread. Meaning it could make sense for long-term holders, and the after-market speculators can compete with the official market maker.

Sorry to interrupt the great circle-jerk, but what about the block size limit? Soon the transaction cost will start increasing.

Well, they make the mistake trying to feed the same bullshit they feed to their investors to the public...

Well, bitpay still employs many people (around 60 in 3 different offices, I heard somewhere), so it definitely has expenses. I think the business model could be something like:
1. Play fractional-reserve on the floating funds. I hope they don't do this, I don't think this could be sustainable.
2. Speculate on bitcoin value. There is a time-window between the fiat payment, while bitcoin comes instantly in. So theoretically bitpay can have 1-5 days before they liquidate the bitcoins. If BTC keeps going up, lots of free cash. If it goes down, oops, lots of losses.
3. Sell bitcoins above market OTC. Basically do some kind of arbitrage.
I don't know if any of these is very reasonable strategy, Anyway, bitpay has received $32 million venture funding, so they have some cash to burn anyway.

There has been forks on other cryptocurrencies, because of different reasons. In those cases the value of both chains work freely. With ethereum there was a split, and the minor chain is called ethereum classic. Ethereum classic value is about one tenth from ethereum. It is quite likely that the less popular chain would have marginal/diminishing value, and people would call the winning one Bitcoin.


I think "random" fork event with bitcoin has near zero change of happening. Talk about splits is mostly just fearmongering IMO. There could have been splits in the history of bitcoin, if some small group would have wanted to reject some change. But that has never happened and I think it is very unlikely to happen.


I don't think it is at all likely that you could lose that much that easily via fork event. Probably just some FUDsters or some other people with weird brains or some weird agenda are spreading this bullshit.
Ofc bitcoin value can change drastically for many reasons, but I think for example exchange hacks, regulation etc pose much bigger risks than uncontrolled hard fork.

Care to elaborate how? You are throwing around one-sentence claims without any proof. I think there is no way to prove that, in the end it is based on some kind of trust.
However there is one pretty easy method of making sure that bank run won't hurt you, just withdraw all the coins to your personal wallet after you've done the trading continuously. Works on all exchanges.

I can understand the viewpoint, but I would still say Bitcoin makes a difference, although it might be a minor one. Bitcoin isn't a silver bullet. It could however help in some cases. Tangible property is illiquid and handling it is often pain in the ass for goverment bureocrats, therefore they resort in seizing it more rarely. Also, sometimes the goverment officials can use their powers against the law, at least in less civilized countries. Having the final control of your own intangible assets might be a great help there.

@_date: 2017-02-08 07:48:00
Even with slight nuances in development there are parties that benefit from the change, and those who benefit less, and maybe those who just get extra work and not much benefits. While probably for everyone wants bitcoin to get more adopted and more used, the changes to the protocol can have vastly different effects on different actors. For blockstream it looks like they are invested quite heavily to SegWit and want it to go through quite badly. Sucks to be them, since it looks like that is not going to happen.

That is simply false. You are either lying intentionally or just don't bother actually studying the statistics. For example slush pool allows voting on changes. It is one of the first mining pools originating from Czech Republic. User base is probably western or diverse. It has sizeable amount of votes for Bitcoin Unlimited, which doesn't support SegWit at least for now.
Also this talk about "chinese miners" sounds borderline racist to me as well. In reality there are people with differing stances from all countries.

Yeah, I would say it is more like the internet supports that act. You can create pointless scripts and publish them on github. That's a great thing. However I don't think Bitcoin has much to do with it.
From bitcoin user perspective this is just a way to get your transaction confirmed slower. I don't think even the writer of this script will end up using it in the long run, after he/she realizes how pointless it is.
Theoretically, of course, if people start using this script it will have effect on the non-segwit miners. But get real. Nobody is going to use this script. It is totally pointless.
Edit: and no, it is not a powerful act. Nobody will care.
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:23:22
However if you think about it, if there is something like 10 000 smaller exchanges or brokers, it is already quite decentralized. And you don't need to store the bitcoins on the exchanges, so you risk your funds only during the trade.
I think new exchanges are always welcome. Absolute decentralization is the ideal, but semi-decentralization is a good compromise.

Forks shouldn't cause much worries to HODLer. For those who do business with bitcoin they are a more problematic, but even then most situations are manageable.
Basically when forks happen, you have your coins on both chains. If you HODL, just wait till the situation settles, you can sell your coins on the chain you believe less etc.
For exchange operators, the best way is to implement some processes so that people can redeem or trade the coins on the other chain. If business stay alert enough, there shouldn't be much problems. Forks should be quite predictable in a way that you can see the adoption as a miner vote etc. Just freee transfers if situation is unclear, and once it is more clear be just careful on which chain do you accept deposits and send withdrawals.

But you don't need specialized hardware to have bitcoin interface, you just need basic memory/storage and cpu. Why would any sane person (or autonomous AI, whatever) put bitcoin _mining_ chip on battery-enabled device? The whole thing looks like the 21 guys are totally living some fantasy land...
It is entirely different question whether we should have bitcoin wallet on every device. Why not? It is already doable on some basic microcontrollers etc. On mobile, you can use the already existing chips on the device. However that is entirely different thing than having bitcoin mining chip on device, which doesn't make economic sense.

Hmm, why is BU is related to this discussion (segwit adoption)?
"And the majority wants Segwit."
How do you know? I think this is very difficult to prove. There is no way to get good solid data on question "what do majority of bitcoin users want".
@_date: 2017-02-06 07:42:12
Your analysis doesn't sound very solid, mostly because miners have very low incentive doing orphan blocks in any case. In fact the incentive of not doing that is very high, because it is direct money loss.
I'm not familiar with BU but it sounds weird that somehow miners would now start doing willingly very risky 5 block orphan chains because some algorithm change. They wouldn't be that stupid?

Well, I'm very sure that my "estimatefee" results jumped very high after this. Now they're already gone a bit lower from what they gave earlier. If this kind of thing can be triggered with some effort/money, there is clear financial incentive for miners to get the fee pumped up.

Yeah very unlikely mining pools would be doing anything special with those transactions. They'll treat and broadcast them as just normal transactions. It makes sense to devote their developer resources toward something else.
In fact, I think it is in their incentives to have other nodes to have the same transaction set as their own, so the blocks will validate and confirm the blocks faster when they find a block. I have heard that pools are already using some kind of "overlay network" to communicate over the block data faster. That'll decrease orphan rate and will mean better businss.

With finance services it is not very good advice to rely on only one experience.

Even if 98% of the bad services users would be happy, you wouldn't still want to choose that and take the risk of 2% change of losing your money.
@_date: 2017-02-08 07:25:57
"well supported and not controversial"
According to miner adoption, it is not well supported. In fact the support seems to be going down. For exchanges and services it makes sense to be prepared to it, if it activates. For those supporting segwit doesn't not necessarily mean that they are in favour of segwit. You are looking at the wrong metric.
@_date: 2017-02-26 08:25:15
Why to not have the getinfo as well is in the software and not deprecate it? Why not to have it around, as so many people are used to it and it is probably used very widely by existing code? This is pointlessly making it more difficult for people to upgrade.

Yeas, you can save on your transactions 30% or something, when you are transacting with others who support segWit. However when you transact with those who don't support segwit you still have to use traditional transactions.
Yes, you can upgrade but don't except significant benefit in short-term. Even in long-term the benefits are not that great.

If you are traveling and don't have ATM access then you have to get cash from somewhere. That means going for bitcoin atm, local exchanger or selling btc for moneygram or WU transfer. I'm quite sure that the fees with the bitcoin route are quite high, unless you know the market and are willing to be a market maker (eg. set up an ad to localbitcoins and wait). Typically ATM's have 5-10% premiums and local exchangers even more, or at least the limits are high (you have to exchange a lot).

At least argumenting with tx fees is stupid, because developer time costs easily more than you can spend on the tx fees. Unless the developer wage is very low (it is possible that the dev is paid something like $2/hour, but well..).
And of course typical dev invests to many tools/services as well, I think the tx fees will be only a drop in the ocean compared to typical other expenses.
For me it just seems that many programmers can't just compare costs to their time... Which leads to irrational investment decisions with their time.

@_date: 2017-02-15 07:56:53
My theory: I think it's an issue of trust. The miners don't trust core. They want a blocksize increase via hard fork, so that it follows technological progress for the foreseeable future. I think their fear is, that if segwit gets activated, core devs are happy and won't do anything after that regarding blocksize increase, and will instead focus on some 2nd layer scaling issues, leaving the 1MB limit to stay in place.
I think one reason why the mienrs don't trust core, is that blockstream has lots of technology/products developed around segwit, and they seem to have very high hopes regarding it. However for miners segwit doesn't mean much regarding business opportunities. So they are sceptical.
@_date: 2015-01-28 09:55:48

I have never understood much bitching about this. I have developed a lot of bitcoin software, for 3 years now, and in total I have spent to btc transaction fees about $100. For that amount, I can probably hire a software developer for two hours.
At some point I tried setting up and using testnet, but the time needed to set it up etc took easily more than two hours. Sometimes some miner overmined testnet so that no new blocks were coming, etc. For me it makes much more sense just to test with small amounts with real btc. The amount you lose in tx fees is much smaller than the effort needed to play with testnet.

Well, BlockStream can already implement SegWit on top of their favourite altcoin or they can just fork the bitcoin and implement segwit there as well.
One thing to take into account is that with bitcoin you actually need shitloads of mining power to actually maintain that minority fork. That was not the case with ethereum (ETH-ETC) fork, which readjusted difficulty each block or so - the minority chain would survive pretty well even on small mining power.

That doesn't make sense. Whether it would result in a disasterous hard fork is questionable, also it is questionable if the price would plummet. However in that scenario those who are holding biggest amount of btc would be biggest losers. Bitcoin mining business would suffer but it is very short-term business anyway - there are always better chips coming out and it easily becomes unprofitable to mine along time. What would matter in that case is what they do with their profits.

Depends what you mean by "not working". Cloudflare DDOS migitation uses PoW AFAIK, and it works to some extent. However of course any attacker with endless resources will always win. The question is about making the attack costlier for the attacker, not about making theoretically perfect system. If the cost/benefit ratio of the attack goes up, it will make things marginally more difficult for the attacker, and help deal with the attacks.
I think simple PoW could help with tor, at least for a short time. It is much, much more easier to implement than a bitcoin wallet to the browser AFAIK. Therefore the cost/benefit ratio for implementing it would potentially be smaller.

They probably would, if there is a chain fork, and otherwise it is possible, I think there are quire few "ifs". First, creating an altcoin isn't BU's goal. In fact, such altcoin strategy is stupid, since you "premine" to current btc holders (as a altcoin founder you could as well premine to yourself only).
Also a thing to note is that with ETH/ETC the difficulty adjusts each block, while with btc it adjusts each 2 weeks. And block speed is with ETH 15 secs, while with BTC it is 10 minutes. This would mean dramatically slower block speeds for the losing chain in BTC.

If satoshi moves his coins to a new address, and nobody knows who that new address belongs to, why it would make frontpage news? I at least would find that pretty uninteresting.
Satoshi can just create one-time-use addresses, move his coin around, tumble through different services/mixers/coinjoin/etc, and after sometime use the coins somewhere. Users would notice the initial movement, but soon lose the track.
Edit: also, there are privacy-oriented altcoins such as monero (ring signatures) and soon zooko's zcash. I don't know how these work but at least they are advertising anonymity. It would be very effortless for satoshi to just sell his stash slowly to monero or whatever, hold for some time and then sell back to bitcoin, using shapeshift and similar services. And of course 7 layered VPN proxies + TOR.

Keep in mind:
1. no any significant service has said that they support BU. In fact, there is only one small service which has announced BU support, and this is the first time I've heard about them. Without exchange/service support BU doesn't matter.
2. Signaling for BU doesn't mean hard fork or that a miner would actually mine invalid (forking) blocks. Signaling can be done just for politics, trolling or whatever, and it does cost only quite minimal effort. You can signal BU and still run actually something else, in fact miners have been running custom software for quite long to my knowledge.
So, in the end my opinion is that don't pay attention to this bullshit. Both the BU folk and the people against it are just making a big fuss over nothing.

SW is good, similar way as bzip is better than gzip, since it offers better compression ratio. With SW we can stuff more stuff to the blocks (+ some additional benefits).
However raising the block size doesn't prevent SW or lightning network. And vice versa, developing SW via soft work doesn't prevent doing the block size hard fork as well later.

I think it would be great if bitcoin users had some other way to vote than just mining power. I have never myself mined so it would be great to have some proper tools to voice opinions on that.
However with this style of voting I just think it is pointless, and there will be no one using that system so it doesn't make sense. Of course in the future it might happen that this gets but I think the likeliness is pretty much close to 0,01%. So if you know any proper prediction markets which have bets on that topic I would be pretty willing to put some bets. 
There are some other voting type of systems which might or might not work out in the long run, but clearly everything I've heard before makes sense more than this idea. For example:

"much easier", lol no, this is very theoretical scenario. Why would miners take any changes mining the losing chain, that would be burning money. It should be very clear after couple of blocks which chain has more mining power, and miners would switch to mine that.
But anyway this is theoretical on so many levels, also because it looks very probable that BU isn't going to be adopted.

This is a good question. I don't know if I'm really concerned about it, but I think Bitcoin would be better with increasing block size. Image our technology developing forward. Ten years ago I had 100Mbps connection at home, and it was bleeding edge and expensive. Nowadays I have 1Gbps. And hard drive sizes went from 250GB to 4TB.
Ten years from now, I could have 10Gbps connection at home, and 40TB hard drives could be standard. Isn't it laughable, that Bitcoin block size would still be 1 MB?
I'm not that concerned, because I'm pretty sure that some better cryptocurrency will take over in the long-term, if there is no block size increase.

Well, some kind of LN should be possible without segwit - funny that there is something like 8 implementations (I heard), but not a single one thought that segwit wouldn't go through and maybe implement first basic one for current network?


LN isn't the only option for solving those issues, any kind of offchain transactions are.


Law enforcement will probably be interested if you route others peoples money, no matter which way it is done.


How many persons are willing to do something like this? Essentially running a service over tor and trying to stay hidden from the authorities. There should be significant stakes for that.




Yeah, of course if you invest to btc it ties your capital to btc and you can't use the capital for USD-only payments unless you sell the btc. Similarly as you stated LN ties the capital to the LN network. I guess we have the same definitions for that word now?


Well currently no LN exists. There will be probably quite a long time for a first usable implementation to pop up. Not even altcoins have implemented anything like that, even though it would be probably much easier to them, because no need for segwit etc.

"Though some of the supporters may not fully realize it, the current move is effectively firing the development team that has supported the system for years to replace it with a mixture of developers which could be categorized as new, inactive, or multiple-time-failures."
I don't think so. The core devs are not employed by the users, and the users are not customers or in any kind of other relationship with the core devs. Core devs don't have any responsibilities for the end users, they can just do whatever they want with the core development. Equally no one is obliged to run core teams software. They are free to do so if they want, since the software is released for free.

This is very false claim. In Visa you have the company (2rd party) watching over the transaction. While many find the chargeback process unjust, there are some rules they follow.
In Bitcoin there is no chargeback process and no 3rd party who handles the transaction, just the bitcoin network. It is not equivalent to chargeback, not at all. That claim is total bullcrap.

Bitcoin can't be destroyed. Maybe development can be stalled but that isn't destroying it, the protocol will keep working. 
To me this sounds very lousy conspiracy theory. BU guys probably just want bigger blocks, their goal isn't to destroy bitcoin or profit by some weird market manipulation. Profiting via market manipulation is very difficult anyway, it doesn't make sense to pour tons of work and money to something and the profit scheme to be some slight market manipulation strategy. But blockstream employees propably have hard time understanding this, since their only income is VC funds.

Before uber even existed, I sometimes took unregulated cab rides from strangers. In my country the taxi system is heavily regulated, there is only limited amount of licenses, so at many times there are not enough regular taxis even when they are ridiculously expensive.
I think some people exaggerate this a bit too much. I've never been scammed by a random stranger offering ride, in my country or elsewhere when traveling. Just have to negotiate the price beforehand. However I have been scammed by regular taxis where I have assumed fair price, and after the ride the price turns out to be something else than fair.

Your post is biased. In addition to the amount being wrong, also you are letting out important details. Such as the fact that it will be probably quite a long time before services actually migrate to segwit transactions. I'm in favour of segwit but I kind of understand those who oppose it, because it seems people want it so bad that they are eager to tell half-truth/half-lies all the time to promote it. That kind of activity is irritating.

What FUD? LN is just an application on top of Bitcoin. Either you use it or not, the people who don't use it shouldn't have no problems with it since it doesn't affect them. LN is not a protocol change like segwit.

Well, it should be very unlikely. Sharing private keys is generally discouraged. You should never see the private key or get it out from the wallet, only sign stuff with it.
I think the issues related to private key copying are related to cases where the wallet is corrupt, wallet software is working or something like that...
Edit: I've very rarely heard people sharing private keys, and usually those cases are related to paper wallets.

You also have to count in the other transaction costs. It is not only the price, but also the time and hassle caused by stuck transactions and fee estimations.
Also, people will always complain to some extent, because value is subjective. So no price will be low enough for some.

I bet banks would like to be less dependant on central banks. In theory. In practice they have huge lock-in to the central banking economy, so the cost of switch is very expensive.

1. Mt. gox was a "bitcoin bank" holding the private keys for the customers money. When you have a balance at mtgox you don't really have bitcoin, as you don't own the private key. You have promise from mtgox that they will deliver bitcoin when you request a withdraw - a promise that they failed to keep.
2. Mt. gox wasn't decentralized in any way. It was a centralized service offering bitcoin as a deposit/withdraw method. It had actually pretty little to do with any decentralized technology. You only have to hack the centralized database to cheat the system in that case.
Most bitcoin services are very centralized, so if you have balance there, you don't actually have bitcoin but a promise to get bitcoin. It makes sense to run a wallet (electrum, bitcoin core, breadwallet) and withdraw all your btc there from various services.
Rule of a thumb is that if it is a website, then it is a service, if you run a client software, then you hold the private keys and own the bitcoins. (There are some exceptions to this)

You don't need to agree with LN and similar networks, because they are market-adopted second layer technologies.

I don't really grasp what you are trying to say. Miners run a code that activates it on 95% miner support threshold (specific rules which you probably know pretty well). Whether that means miner decision or not sounds a bit irrelevant rhetorics to me. My point is that it means only little what the other nodes or economic actors do. The new blocks are valid to older versions as well so following the list of supporting services etc is a little off focus IMO.

@_date: 2016-11-13 09:20:30
But how can that kind of arguments be valid in the long term? If bitcoin usage keeps growing the fees are not going to be 20k satoshi per kb. Also, an average consumer values predictability, which bitcoin offers most of the time but sometimes you have spikes.
I mean, you can always argue that if you use the right wallet, fee algorithm, whatever, you can get pretty good fees. However I think it is not a valid thing for an average joe to keep tuning the fees all the time.

@_date: 2016-11-13 09:18:00
The claim isn't exactly true, but it also isn't that far way off. The more expensive it is to move bitcoins, of course the less attractive alternative it it to some other value transfer methods. But also the fees go up because more people are using bitcoins. It is quite a complex dynamic.

@_date: 2016-12-02 06:42:03
Well if there is sudden boost in usage in the bitcoin network, the transactions will stay unconfirmed, and the usage should go down pretty quickly because you can't actually use bitcoin (eg. the network is congested). The dynamics aren't that simple.
IMO it is quite irrelevant if these spikes are spam attacks or not, they have been happening now randomly for couple of years and it doesn't look like they are going away. So it makes sense to be prepared for them somehow.

Yes, proposals have been made, but for example this implementation hasn't been evolving much (eg. no pull request with implementation etc).

Well, paypal fees aren't exactly cheap (2,9% or something). But for example EU bank transfers are practically free AFAIK. And how do you exactly hard fork a centralized database? :P
Usually investments have some time-span. I don't think it is very likely that Roger would lose much of his investment even if he managed to pull off hard fork to bitcoin.
Also, it centralization vs. decentralization isn't a boolean variable. Let's say there were only 500 bitcoin nodes around the world unlike the 5000 around now, it would still be quite difficult to attack in any meaningful way. I don't think that for failing altcoins the node count itself has ever been problem, but other factors.

I think calling it just a transaction spike or network congestion is fine. I don't think it is relevant what is the source of those transaction, as there is no way of preventing from someone creating loads of transactions, if they want to.

I don't know about your line of business, but where I work 9 month ROI is a very good. However, you gotta bake in the risks associated (biggest probably is, that the company is not going to ship on time), and also the fact that mining has diminishing returns over time.
I wouldn't personally mine, it is not my kind of work, but I can definitely see the appeal for people who have time to tinker etc. 9 months payback-time is not bad. For example, if you buy a small apartment, on typical scenario (last heard) you invest 20k your own money, lend 80k, and the payback-time is something like 8 years when you rent. Of course the difference is, that the apartment probably has more liquid aftermarket...

Well, the parties who do the atomic swap determine the rate? Essentially there is no guarantee of any exchange rate at "system level".
Anyway, the value added is quite marginal compared to let's say escrow-based approach. It requires less trust, but many are willing to trade trustlessness for convenience.
The huge promise of sidechains is a guaranteed system where you can change btc to sidechaintokens at some defined rate at protocol level. For example, if you want to swap btc to protocoltokens, 1 BTC = 0.99 sidechaintoken, and when converting back 1 sidechaintoken = 0.99 BTC. (the fees go to miners or something). At least that's how I would've understood the system based on the marketing here on reddit.
If the rate floats at market, it is not very interesting - transfering value from one cryptocurrency to another is already very easy.

One more question, from the sidechains paper: 
On the section 3.2, "symmetric two-way peg", there is talk about "special output". However, I can't find any explanation how this "special output" is formed.
Is there anywhere explanation, how the transaction carrying value to the sidechain is composed? And how the transaction from the sidechain back to the mainchain is composed?

Hmm ok. I'll see how they handle it this time. I would guess their best interest would be to guarantee that the money goes to the solver.
About tax implications, if you want to receive money, you have to pay taxes. In practically every jurisdiction, and there is nothing a service like bountysource can do about that. I guess it is possible to say "no" to the bounty, if receiving party thinks that the hassle of dealing with the tax implications is greater than the amount received.

Well, because BTCROW guys are probably stupid. However providing that kind of information isn't recommending the service. They literally said in the same email that you should use another escrow service. They didn't recommend sending the btc without escrow.

I don't like the idea of having to do a transaction after each trip. That would reduce the value of uber to me, because much of the value of uber is in the effortlessness etc.
Uber already has gift card system, but it only works in the US and its usage is quite limited. I hope that they open the system, so that people would be able to sell uber gift cards for bitcoin. That would be good enough system for me.

Netherlands might be a place where SEPA transfers are blocked very rarely. However in many other EU countries I've heard SEPA transfers reversed/blocked quite regurarly (or the assets frozen, whatever, essentially you don't have access to the money in some form or other).
"Sepa can be used safely to receive money."
For common/normal use, yes. For bitcoin trading, I wouldn't agree. I don't know if it makes sense to argue about the topic because it is pretty much up to your and my personal empirical information.
@_date: 2015-07-07 08:43:42
That is a different discussion altogether. My point was just that your calculations are essentially wrong.
Regarding block size change I don't have strong opinions on the big picture. It would certainly cause hassle for me personally, since I keep quite a many full nodes. The rising tx fees are not a problem for me personally, since the tx fees are still so low that they are very minimal compared to the value transfered. It is possible to get old low-fee transactions confirmed via child-pays-parent (or something, I don't remember the exact term, but means basically that you create new high-fee tx on top of the old low-fee tx, and a miner has incentive to include those both to block.)

Depends on the culture and country as well. And of course on individuals.

Like communists for example, "to everyone according to their needs".

Yeah, to my knowledge OKPay is very difficult to chargeback, much more difficult than SEPA. However it is still technically possible if OKPay guys decide that they want to reverse some payments (they try to guarantee you that they never want that). With bitcoin chargebacks aren't techically possible. My point was to demonstrate the difference, as the marketing speak often doesn't make the distinction very clear.

Being "segwit ready" might signal a wrong thing, since even old wallets will work after segwit is activated via miner activation. Only old wallets won't see the new segwit transactions instantly, only after 1 confirmation.
I guess some people might somehow get the idea that segwit is backwards-incompatible, because people talk about so much about wallets being "segwit-compatible".
In fact, it would make sense to differentiate what is meant by "segwit-compatible":
1. the wallet is capable of seeing and relaying the segwit transactions at zero confirmations, or
2. the wallet makes segwit transactions
And because segwit also has possibility of having new address format, it might make sense to explain if that is planned to be used.
@_date: 2016-02-10 16:41:31
The benefit is just to save on transaction fees, not to make transactions quicker. I don't know if that is very useful currently, however the situation might change if transaction fees start to rise.
"If the funds are essentially owed to the other services anyways, why would it matter that the protocol "ties less capital"?"
I would guess that still from operational aspect the size of hot wallet matters, and most bitcoin services use hot wallet / cold wallet setup to migitate the risk of an attack. The smaller hot wallet you have, the better.
"services running a fractional reserve i.e. spending money they owe to other people? "
It is up to the services that use the protocol to decide how do they use it. The protocol doesn't really add much value to running fractional reserve as far as I see it. It isn't recommendable for receiving service to consider the funds arrived unless the batch transaction has multiple confirmations, the same as for normal btc transactions.

The concept of public-key cryptography is easy to understand, the implementations (ECDSA, RSA, etc) are more difficult. Or I don't actually know how difficult they are to understand, but most people don't bother learning about them since they trust scientists that they work good enough for now. Same for hash functions.
I don't know if this is good analogue for payment channels / LN though. There is no "deeper math" involved as far as I understand, just shitloads of different offchain transaction for various scenarios. Maybe we'll see if someone can put this in usable form.

Trust works in weird ways, there might be endless reasons why people don't trust the core team and don't want to upgrade to segwit. Maybe someone doesn't like what some core dev said, etc.
But these various things such as litecoin adoption might improve the situation and convince people. I'm pretty sure what won't convince people is this endless argumentation on reddit. The basic argument seems to quite often be "people are stupid because they don't upgrade", which I'm pretty sure actually moves people away from trusting core.

On the other hand, if you don't update your wallet, you shouldn't lose any coins.

However you will see the funds once they are confirmed.

This is true, the fees won't cover even the server costs. However I want to at least enable the bitcoin network transfer fee, and this is why some small fee will be there always.
Since the service generates lots of bitcoin addresses, it might be possible that bitcoin network transaction fees are enforced because the transaction takes too much size. If there weren't a small fee, the wallet could theoretically achieve a negative balance.
Additionally, I want to enable the network fee because I want as fast as possible confirmation for my transactions.

Many people don't test their software at all. Some devote to testing 5x the time they devote to development. It is quite invidual thing what everyone thinks to be necessary.
With changes to bitcoin, I'm pretty sure the more a feature is tested, the happier miners/users are to activate the feature. I don't think there is so such thing as on/off variable for "properly tested".
With litecoin vs. testnet you can argue that litecoins have actual value, while testnet coins don't have value. Because of that I think many see the tests with litecoin as more valuable, since attackers have an financial incentive to find vulnerabilities and problems.

I find bitcoin/cryptocurrencies thousand times fairer than the existing fiat currencies, you don't. You can keep using your fiat money, I can switch to bitcoin. No problem.
Additional advantage to cryptocurrency fairness: nobody forces you to adopt it. With fiat, not so - you must always pay taxes in fiat, even if you trade with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is considered form of barter in most countries, to my understanding.

Well, the two key concept in understanding Bitcoin is private keys and bitcoin addresses. These can be pretty well demonstrated using paper wallets.


If paper wallets are generated offline and stored safely in a safe, they are pretty secure. Of course the key to this is that people understand that the private key is the money.
What is your proposal then? Storing bitcoins on average windows computer infected with malware and viruses?


The actual fraud rate matters, not theoretical. Bit-pay accepts zero-confirmation payments, and there have been no double spends (at least as reported by them).
@_date: 2012-11-19 11:07:48
It has some useful properties:
- Explaining the concept to newbies - private key vs. bitcoin address
- Easy concept, while still secure - print the notes offline etc., store them in to a safe location
- Trade using these in high-trust environment (friends &amp; family)
- Maybe even pay with them in the future - merchant scans the private key, and sends the cange to your new btc address. You throw the paper away after using
Edit: however this particular note has the drawback that it doesn't have the bitcoin address with the note.

I have thought about the idea for some time. The marketplace operator could take something like 30% cut. Any private invidual could sell their internet connection to the chinese and earn some bitcoins in the process.
There could be some rules which could stop the chinese goverment from knowing which IP's operate in the market. For example, someone could buy certain VPN/IP address recurringly, and others couldn't purchase that specific IP - that way the goverment would have no way to know how that specific connection is used.
And of course, bitcoin isn't very easy or well established payment method - bring in the resellers/market makers from china. These could (with some easy to use software/API) resell these VPN's to the chinese inviduals.

You don't seem to grasp even the basics of the concept. Bitcoin isn't alternative to taxation. You have to pay taxes the same way, whether you are having income in bitcoin or dollars/euros/whatever your currency is. Only that with bitcoin you have to convert the money first, since you aren't allowed pay taxes using bitcoins.
Most money in the fiat currency system is created from thin air by private banks. And of course printed by central banks at will. You think that is fairer than bitcoin? I heard fed is printing $40 billion a month with QE3. Bitcoin market cap is something like 150 million.

We are developing a new site as a clever way to accept bitcoins as a merchant. This utilizes the Electrum client model, and you can only accept payments using this service - even if the service is hacked, your bitcoins are safe (you can store them on separate computer, offline or even in a brainwallet).
Also, for vending machine use and possibly also for small giveouts/cash selling of bitcoins, I have started developing "coupon" feature for easywallet.org (hosted wallet). With this, you can create coupons nomitaded for example in dollars: at the time of redeem, the amount is converted to bitcoins using 24h weighted average.

I see no potential in these. Mobile phones are going to be used for bitcoin payments, if any.
Already you can get basic mobile phones with 20 dollars. Add basic camera to that, and you have 30 dollars. Then you can send and receive bitcoins using QR codes. And you can already buy the cheapest android smartphones for about 80 dollars.
I don't see the battery as the problem - every storeowner usually has electricity, then you just need a charger if customer has run out of battery. You can accept payments by just providing basic wifi connectivity (doesn't require much bandwidth).
Mobile phone companies could create their own altchains and include the basic software to their phones by default, and then make all their franchises exchangers = own the 3rd world. I guess this kind of move would be the only saviour for Nokia :D

Bitcoinica offers interest on your bitcoins, and that is something I trust - because it is pretty obvious how they are making money with those bitcoins. They are lending them to gamblers, and because gamblers gamble within their system, they can't lose the money.

1. go to easywallet.org - a new secrect URL with a new bitcoin address is generated for you.
2. paste your bitcoin address to the web site
3. funds will appear in your wallet as they are donated
4. (optional) You can also add link as explained by nickname "gox"
I think that in the bitcoin world, buttons aren't needed...

Depending what kind of contracting do you do, you can slowly use more time for bitcoin projects and allocate less time for contracting.
I'm kind of in the same situation as you, I'm financing my bitcoin projects from savings/freelancing. I highly doubt that I will make any money from bitcoin projects anytime soon, but because I believe in the project, and I'm passionate about it, I'm willing to risk my standard of living for it. Of course my girlfriend probably doesn't like the idea :D
I have also raised my freelancing rates. My clients approach me now only when they really need me, because it costs more. So I have a little bit less money, but I also work much less hours.
Also it helps to not just think about developing bitcoin projects as a contractor/open source/etc, but as a startup businesses as well. Bitcoin might as well enable new kind of business models, you just have to be creative. Perhaps you have to step a little bit out of the programmer viewpoint, and try to understand marketing/business as well.
And finally, I usually encourage people to try different technologies as well. In my opinion, it is not good for technologist to limit himself/herself to a certain technology, such as java. Better to think first what kind of problem you want to solve, and then choose the technologies afterwards.

What kind of product are you selling? If I understand right, you are only going to accept bitcoin as a payment method for your software? That doesn't sound like a very good strategy. After all, bitcoin users are so small group currently, most of the people don't even know about bitcoin yet.
However, if your software/product is related or directed towards bitcoin users, it might make sense. Maybe you want to tell more about your specific offering.
(btw. it might be a funny marketing strategy to offer "bitcoin coupons" alongside your product, eg. bitcoin private keys.)

- You can use a real exchange to correct the situation (eg. deposit cash into bank, wire the cash to mtgox, or sell the bitcoins at mtgox, and get the cash from ATM).
- You can reflect the demand situation in your pricing: if there is too much buyers, raise prices and vice versa.
I added a paragraph to the guide, tips for this kind of situation.
And remember, while there might be not much demand in your area right now, the situation might change, and you would be the first guy in that market ;)

This is a very old topic. You should price your goods in dollars/euros/whataver stable currency, and then paying with bitcoin uses 24h exchange rate or something. Almost every webshop etc supports this. I also don't see what is the big deal with this. It is pretty fair method.

What wallet are you using? From which software are you sending and on which are you receiving?
On the receiving side, it is natural to require confirmations before you can spend the funds, especially with web wallets. With standalone wallets you can usually spend the money instantly.
On the sending side, the funds you send become unavailable at the moment you send them. The rest should be untouched &amp; spendable. What you describe sounds really weird behauviour, I haven't noticed anything like it. myself.

The inflation rate is very high, like 35% annually right now. However, there is "promise" of diminishing inflation, which is built in to the system, and which anybody is unable to affect. So the currency in circulation won't never exceed 21 million. Time will tell, if bitcoin is able to keep this promise.


It is like stock, the price is based on supply and demand on free market. And because bitcoin is something we have never seen before, the valuation is impossible to predict. Bitcoin has several advantages over other currencies:
- No central bank, new money is generated at a known rate
- Easily and cheaply transferable in milliseconds all over the world
- No one can seize your funds
- Strong anonymity &amp; privacy (however requires additional tricks to ensure this.)

Bitcoinica.com offers interest for your deposits.
Also look at the bitcointalk.org forums (Lending): 
Actually, there are lots of bitcoin lenders. Bitcoinica lends bitcoins to offer leverage for speculators - for them it is safe bet, since they can force liquidizations, so they don't lose their loans. Also all "loaned" money is kept inside bitcoinica.
Other loans usually are high-risk and high-interest. In fractional-reserve-banking money is created when new loans are made, this makes interests low and loans cheap. With bitcoin this is not possible, since the money is hard. This doesn't make lending impossible, just more riskier.

Not really, there is this software called bitcoin client (actually multiple of these), which makes the process really easy. Just type in the exchanges bitcoin address and amount and press send.
However with really really small bitcoin transactions (0-5 USD cent range), the bitcoin network fee might be pretty big portion of the payment. If you want to enable micropayments on this scale, you might want to use something else than bitcoin, like your own private database on top of bitcoin. And even in this case, using less bitcoin addresses doesn't help at all - it is the transactions which take the space, not the addresses.

Of course you can fairly easily download the blockchain data then again, if you happen to need it for some more advanced purpose.

If you want to accept bitcoin payments, the most hassle-free way is to use bit-pay/paysius and take fiat to your bank account. Or even if you take bitcoin directly, the problem is pretty trivial - just use the market rate for determining bitcoin value.
However, if you want to sell bitcoins to your customers, that is much harder problem. Mining hardware is trivial, but with bitcoin there are some problems, like VAT.
In my country (Finland), companies/people have used couple of tactics to solve this problem:
- Special taxation for used commodities: you pay VAT only from the profit in certain types of goods, where you buy and sell the goods primarily from inviduals.
- Selling a service, which buys you coins from an exchange. This way you only have to pay the VAT from the service itself.
Probably not much help, since it is entirely different jurisdiction. Anyway, good luck for your ventures.

I have played with electrum, I will probably migrate to it once it gets more stable and I'm more confident about its situation (dev lead left the project some time ago).
If I had larger amounts of BTC, I'd probably use brainwallet as well.

I haven't done any calculations myself, but if the miners who want investments have special knowledge/expertise/etc about mining, and there are benefits of scale, it might be worth it. However additionally you are also trusting the guy running the mining operation pretty highly.
It would seem to me that running your own mining operation is the most sensible choice, since there are no middlemen. However I haven't done any calculations and haven't even done any mining myself...

The thing with bitcoin in the first place is that you shouldn't risk big amounts until you really know what you are doing. First learn to play with small sums, and later when you get the concept, you can actually start using it.

a) This might work in the longer term, but not in the near future, since user base is pretty small
b) This might work as well, but free competition already exists (use free services or code your own, in addition I've heard mtgox is planning something like this)
c) Why would people use your wallet, when free alternatives exist without this cut?
d) Probably won't work, I don't see any advantages for exchanges to work with a wallet provider, since they like to be wallets themselves. Of course user acquisition with affiliate marketing is possiblity, but slim.
Just my opinion. In terms of business I think there exist numerous opportunities for bitcoin, but wallet services are not very convincing in my opinion.
It might be that many bitcoin projects are bootstrapping or are in stealth mode - I know at least one project which has pretty solid funding, and is in stealth mode.

I assume you mean "encourage spending". I don't see spending as something that needs to be encouraged.
@_date: 2012-02-25 23:04:16
I think that the biggest potential in the near-term future is different financial services, such as exchanges. Or maybe similar, more specialized services, such as service that allows paying your bills with bitcoins. Or debit/credit cards which you can load with bitcoins.
The thing is, if you are developing a traditional business, the payment methods don't matter that much. As a business you just want to accept as much payment methods/currencies as possible. And then you convert the payments to currencies you value most, be it dollars, euros, bitcoins or gold.
Outside "financial services" (which some bad-mouthed guy would consider "money laundering services"), I see most potential for services which utilize micropayments and marketplace-style business models. Bitmit.net could become really big. But there could be also other marketplace-style business models, such as selling/buying bandwidth/storage/computer power and microtasks.

One method for this:
1. Go to 
2. "Save page as..." to your hard drive
3. Disconnect your computer from the internet, disable wifi, ethernet, everything
4. Restart browser, clear private data, etc etc (other paranoid methods also here)
5. Open the html file from your hard drive
6. Generate the addresses
7. Print the private keys to paper wallet, and store the public addresses somewhere on your computer
8. Delete everything: private data, the html file etc., restart your computer + other paranoid methods here again
9. Done
You can also generate BrainWallets using this html file: "Wallet Details" -&gt; enter any passphrase in to the "Private Key" field, and press "View Details". The html page will take SHA256 of your passphrase and use it as your bitcoin private key.

These new payment systems are great, because they make also trading bitcoins easier. For example Dwolla helps with this.

How much actually mining creates value? I think that miners don't really create value in itself, the value was created by the bitcoin developers when they defined the protocol.

Even if you totally hate the concept for any reason, bitcoin is a really cool technology - it is really genious setup built by skillful cryptographer. I would recommend to research it to any computer scientists, even when many of them will oppose it because of economical/political reasons. The cryptography/technology side is just fascinating.
For many, bitcoin offers something politically andr/or economically intriguing - removing the power of the ever-expanding state/public sector by taking the currency monopoly away from the state. However I think this is pretty minor reason why some are interested in to bitcoin. But the libertarians/liberals who dig bitcoins, are usually very fanatic about it.
Then there is the "boring" business reasons. No chargebacks, low fees,  no account freezes. Easy and quick to implement, low barrier of entry to the market. Also by accepting bitcoin some businesses may be able to gain some kind of press and free publicity - basically free marketing. Just don't except loads of bitcoin-paying customers anytime soon :)

I guess many investors think that if bitcoin gets used more, the value will grow. Also businesses naturally benefit when there is more bitcoin users. The bitcoin user benefits if there is more businesses using bitcoin.
Most people value liquidity... I think this all is quite obvious. Some hippies like their currency to be small or used only in certain ways, but I think that is fairly small minority.

Some feedback:
- Why to generate real bitcoin transactions? You could save money with transaction fees, if the bot just made internal transactions. Real bitcoin transactions are only needed for depositing and withdrawing.
- I would remove the public message, and only send private messages. Less spam, and the receiver will still know that he/she received money.

Should the society reward the central bankers then?
After all, it is not only the currency bitcoin. It is the bitcoin technology - a way to keep any kind of decentralized database. So anyone can also start their own currency. Open source. Just fork it and start hacking.
Sounds about thousand times fairer than any existing system, if you ask me.

If it is your money, why can't you spend it as you will? If you waste actual money, it is much better economic lesson than this positive-only bet. Try to tell that to your dad :)
The only problem I see, is that BFL probably won't ship those new devices on schedule, therefore it is difficult to estimate when you would receive the device on time. Otherwise just creating a simple script which gets the exchange rate from mtgox, and estimates your daily payout from the difficulty will suffice. Shouldn't be too hard. I think you can fetch all data programmatically from bitcoincharts.com.

I don't know if bitcoin really needs Ver that much. He likes to be a public figure and likes to write political stuff and have speeches, but I kind of doubt that is a critical part of bitcoin adoption. And there seems to be no abundance of people willing to fill that kind of role.
I like the idea where people put their money where their mouth is. At this point it seems quite clear that getting the big blocks done through hard fork seems very improbable. I mean, most core devs apparently don't want to do that at all. So if Ver believes that it is a critical requirement for bitcoin to become more widespread, he should move his wealth elsewhere and I applaud him for that decision.

This is incorrect. The colored-coins concept allows centralized exchanges to work within the system, which allows HFT and other innovations. Of course it is centralization then, but those who want to go long on a stock/asset can manage their asset themselves if they want, those want to do HFT can do it in the exchange. Like a bitcoin web wallet: while your bitcoin private keys are on the server, you are still free to withdraw your coins any time to your private bitcoin address.

Yeah, with domain names it is pretty different from cash.
With bitcoin early adopter rewards + scarcity works, with domain names I'm not so sure. After all, namecoin is just a shared bookmarking/name system, which people need to install and use. What are the incentives to actually start using something like namecoin? There aren't many, unless you are squatting the names yourself.
With bitcoins however, the benefits are pretty obvious. It is already pretty well-established "currency", and there is a lot of various infrastructure built around it, unlike other cryptocurrencies.

Making a business real-time financial information public is very stupid. Competitors can directly see your revenues, pricing, etc. real-time. No a business would do that.
It makes much more sense to generate a new address for each paying customer - and after all, addresses are cheap to generate.
Of course currently a one public address is ok, because probably bitcoin revenue is so small and there isn't basically any competition. But generally privacy is pretty important.

I'm actually just currently developing a new feature for easywallet.org, which allows you to send bitcoins via email in a secure way:
1. bitcoins are sent from the easywallet instance
2. unique easywallet is generated for the recipient
3. after certain period of time, if the new easywallet instance is not visited, the funds are returned to the sender wallet
This protects against email delivery problems - funds are not lost, if the email is filtered as spam or something like that. Also it allows anonymous sending of bitcoins - you don't need to specify "from" address. This allows you to send bitcoins as a donation to anyone anonymously :)

I don't agree with the title.
Quote (Greenspan): "(Under a fiat system), there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation… If there were, the government would have to make its holding illegal, as was done in the case of gold."
Gold has been legal pretty much all the time, and goverment is not hunting gold holders very actively. Most people can purchase, own and sell gold pretty peacefully, without fear. I suspect that bitcoin won't change that.
Eg. if we follow the same logic as the writer, gold ans silver would be banned now and goverments would be actively hunting the owners of gold and silver. That is not the case, at least AFAIK.

Do you know how bitcoin web wallets function? For example, when web wallet transfers "bitcoins" from user A to B, no actual bitcoins are transfered - transaction is only done in web wallet private database.
The centralized stock exchange would work in the same way - the exchange would "own" the actual crypt-stocks, and when user A mades trade with user B, only internal database is changed - no actual bitcoin/crypto-stock transaction. This protects from DDOSes and allows HFT. Only real crypto-stock transactions would be the incoming and outgoing transactions.

You don't have to create account - the secret URL is your account. Just keep it at least in two different places, because if you lose it, your funds are gone.
When you want to transfer the funds, just type the bitcoin address (or email) you want to send your funds to, and press "send". If you want to change the bitcoins to dollars or some other conventional currencies, you have to get the bitcoin address from them (and you have to create an account there). Or you can try selling your bitcoins on localbitcoins.com :D

Fiat money loses it value. Goverments will collapse. As in democratic societies usually 30-60% of the people are directly or indirectly employed by the public sector, chaos will ensue. The militaries will collapse as well, and turn in to different private armies, which you can buy security from with bitcoins.
And since militaries own shitloads of guns, which they no longer can afford to upkeep, some opportunist will buy them cheap/steal them, and sell them again on TOR network for bitcoins. This means cheap guns for bitcoin users, wohoo!

Guess the company needs to make money somehow? They offer easy and hopefully reliable service.
However, if you are a cheapskate and want to save money, it is pretty easy to code similar system yourself and save money. For example with mtgox:
1. Set up an mtgox exchange account, and take the bitcoin deposit address, print it out as a QR code
2. Set up sell order at 99999 BTC @ 99999 USD
3. Code a simple script which monitors your mtgox account and sends you an email everytime balance changes. (you can probably implement this with SMS using some external service). 
4. Now you need only to move your money from mtgox to your bank account/dwolla/etc now and then. Maybe even this can be automated.

And if some place accepts bitcoin payments, I'm bringing my money there. Now it is pretty easy to accept bitcoins, even if you don't know anything about them, so perhaps this can push bitcoin adoption a little.
However, if a merchant trusts in bitcoin as a store of value, then he can just use some android mobile wallet, or standalone bitcoin client. That way there is 0% fee.

It seems more like the bitcoin.org maintainers think that it is dangerous to attract users at all. My theory is that because bitcoin.org doesn't care about marketing for "casuals", the people will enter the bitcoin economy via some other routes, which makes it easy for them. In the end it will be irrelevant if bitcoin.org makes it easy or not, because no one will visit that web site in the first place (but the original nerds, of course).
Edit: that said, I also think that SPV mode is great solution. The sad thing is that with the current development pace it will take something like 3 years for this to develop.

Hi, developer of easywallet here. Easywallet has a fee of 0.002 BTC per transaction. This also includes bitcoind transaction fee. I will state this more clearly in the future updates. I am sorry that this was not stated clearly enough on the site.
So if you deposit 10 BTC, you can only spend 9.998. If you deposit 100 BTC,  you can only spend 99.998 BTC
I developed Easywallet because I wanted several features over Instawallet - such as multiple deposit addresses, which clearly improves privacy &amp; anonymity. I see no privacy/anonymity benefits of the green address feature, although I haven't researched the question in great detail.

I agree - bitcoin is a very risky investment. Maybe just buy a little, and then use them for fun, sharing pizza costs with friends etc. When you are more confident about the technology, maybe then think about investing. 
However if you still want to invest in them, I recommend automated investing with dollar-cost averaging. This can be accomplished somewhat easily with recurring deposits (your bank/dwolla/etc) and the bitcoinbuilder.com service.

It is a free world, anyone can create their own cryptocurrency if they want. Maybe some will try to scam people with them or something, but I think that generally alternative currencies are good, and in the longer run will benefit bitcoin as well.

During bitcoinica bitcoin value was very stable.

The problem with this kind of schemes is that if you are really able to generate 5% daily risk-free profit, why would you waste your time marketing this to someone else? People probably won't believe it, and you have hard time acquiring investors. Instead you would invest all the money you have, and probably take a huge loan. Since you are able to generate 5% profits daily, you would pay the loan back pretty quickly.
However since you really aren't able to generate 5% daily, you aren't willing to take the risk. Instead you try to scam investors by telling that you are able to generate 5% daily and take their money, inventing a ponzi scheme.

"Services that let all their customers withdraw all their funds within hours are the ones you should **not** trust, cause those are the ones that have all funds in a hot wallet with zero checks in place, ready for hackers to grab and run."  
Allowing customers to withdraw their funds is different from actually processing the withdrawals... What I know exchanges keep typically 1-2% of the funds in hot wallet. If lot of customers process withdrawals processing the withdrawals is just delayed until cold wallet is accessed.

This concept is essentially the same as casascius coins, and for some reason people are more eager to promote the casascius coins than paper wallets. It is the same idea, just more cost-effective.

Not really. i think for majority of bitcoin users it is just a tool. People don't care about EUR, USD or other fiat currency, but because it is the best tool (liquidity, official status, etc), they use that. However they would probably switch if there were better alternative available and never miss using the old tool. 
Some people who write here have a strong emotional connection to bitcoin because of investments or something else. I don't think that applies for majority. Bitcoin usage for majority is not about "caring", but usefulness.
And I still think that bitcoin is the most useful from cryptocurrencies for majority, but I don't know if that status will stay.

@_date: 2019-01-02 08:11:51
For services storing the customers funds is a cost center, it adds liability and risk without generating revenue (unless negative interest is implemented, which most don't have AFAIK). So to services the optimal would be customers to keep there only as much as is required for trading.
The processes for storing the coins ins safe cold storage have to be there because of security, which means delays in some situations. It is just something that has to be there for any service serious about security.

Well, you don't redeem the bitcoins unless you need them - as I see, paper wallets are more invented for long-term storage in the vault - like storing cash in your mattress or gold in the forest.
Therefore usually the redeeming isn't a question, when generating paper wallets. However you can try out paperwallets with small sums and redeem them at mtgox - later on you can redeem them with more advanced methods.
@_date: 2012-07-01 07:40:22
Just say the estimated delivery date or something. You were talking like that it is available like tomorrow.

Good to have critical articles there as well.
The claim about anonymity is clearly erronous. It is definitely NOT easy to build profile/transaction history of any bitcoin user and track their transactions. It is actually easy for a very few careless bitcoin users. I would argue, that even when you use bitcoin somewhat normally and not care about anonymity that much, it is probably very hard still to build your bitcoin "profile".
And otherwise the article just seems to be negative for some reason, maybe the writer invested in wrong time? For example, with instant transactions, the actual fraud rate matters, not the theoretical possibility of fraud - the same what is happening with credit cards.

Everyone will still die someday and I believe for most people the goal isn't taking as much BTC to grave as possible. Money is just a tool to enjoy life, and that's it. I plan to spend all my BTC before I die, because I don't believe in afterlife. And even if you would believe in afterlife, it is quite probable that BTC won't be accepted there, but they have their own currency.

I get it. I don't however understand how the 21 inc magic box could solve this problem in *economically sensible* way. Means that if 21 inc creates their own mining farm, how would they benefit by including these microtransactions to the blockchain. Or if a customer buys the 21 inc device, how do they benefit by mining for 21 inc? (It is pretty clear that at least the customer won't benefit, since the mining on the box will be in any case unprofitable).


Well I just don't understand the economic reasoning. Eg. what is the business. Why would anyone process these microtransactions for free? They have to make money somehow.
At least they make money by selling these devices to the suckers who buy them, but other than that, it is very unclear if there is any value in this for the customer.
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:28:40
Incentivizing is very, very difficult. Most companies would probably want to incentivize about every task there is. But only very few tasks are well incentivizable, such as sales jobs. Therefore, many jobs are just on basic salary, as it is not really easily definable how much value the job brings to the company.
Analogy to bitcoin/cryptocurrencies: it was very difficult to properly incentivize processing the ledger and keeping it untouched, but Satoshi managed to design that incentivization problem. There are probably ten other tasks, that need to be done as well, but are not as well incentivizable. Such as developing the code, maintaining the website etc.

How do you know that it is regulatory pressure, instead of some internal problems? I think there is no such a regulation, which limits sending money/assets/whatever to properly KYC'd customer. It is just bullshit invented by banks who want to hold customers money as a hostage for other reasons.
I think more reasonable answer is that they are having problems with fraud, and want to migitate that risk. That would also explain why they stopped accepting credit cards.

Yeah, by putting high enough fee on your transaction. And if you want non-standard transactions, the miners are quite happy to include the transactins to BC, for standard fee. Actually miners are very happy to help with innovating with the blockchain, since bitcoin usage benefits them. 


Maybe only marginally, can you give concrete examples what? Also, maybe it will benefit 21inc, but how does it benefit the suckers who buy this $400 crap box? The main discussion should be, what value does this shitbox bring to the customer. I see none.
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:31:40
Same with about any electronic payment method, which allows person-to-person transfers. Electronic fiat payment processors work as long as no person-to-person payments are allowed. They need consumer -&gt; merchant model, where merchants are strictly regulated.
Bitcoin is of course different, because there is no central processor, it can't be eliminated.

Finance businesses tend to consolidate pretty quickly, because complying with regulations is very expensive. Probably same will apply to bitcoin businesses. In the future, there will be probably couple of megabusinesses doing fiat&lt;-&gt;crypto, and not much else.
However I don't see this will harm the bitcoin users themselves that much. Even if US goverment will want to stop an exchange operating, and throw the exchange operators in jail, they can't take the customer funds. They have to somehow ensure, that the funds end up to the rightful owners, after they close down the shop.
Those who store their crypto themselves shouldn't probably worry that much in any case.

No sensible buyer would buy with bitcoins if the exchange rate used on the shop is much higher than the bid on mtgox.
Use the rate such as MAX(24h, 7d, 30d, mtgoxAsk), then I'm willing to buy from your shop :D
Otherwise, mtgox last or 24h average is pretty fair for both buyer and seller.

They should do that by simply setting their payment processing fee to 1%. Many merchants would be happy to pay that, if they would fix the current problems.

It's not a religion, it's rational move/experimentation. Because bitcoin is deflationary currency, it's value (theoretically) rises everyday if there is more adoption &amp; people use it. In the long term it's sensible to take the risk and do the moving to bitcoin economy.
I'm talking about experimenting here. Of course if it doesn't work very well (eg. bitcoin crashes or stops working for some reason), I can always revert back to previous lifestyle. And of course I would do strict accounting whether how much i have benefited (in fiat money) from moving to bitcoin economy.
Part of the plan is usage of prepaid credit cards via Paxum. I would withdraw only smaller values frequently, so I would benefit (in the long run) more from the bitcoin deflation.

Currently fiat monies are much more stable than bitcoin (if we are speaking about purchasing power). Maybe in the future bitcoin will be more stable than fiat money, but as I see it bitcoin would then already be better accepted than goverment currencies. However that is not the reality today and won't be in the short-term future.


Goverments would issue their own crypto-currencies because they would understand that they are fighting a losing war with their fiat currencies. It would be a desperate move.


Because it is impossible to do so with crypto-currencies (a per current understanding). This would be just goverment launching their own block-chain as a desperate measure.


Well, whatever, that is just a theory not backed by any empirical evidence. Every large-scale practical currency until now has been controlled by goverment. Time will tell what will happen with bitcoin, which is first real-world example of a currency outside goverment control.
I think you missed my point: the goverment could control the initial specifications of the goverment cryptocurrency, after that it will compete with another cryptocurrencies/currencies and it will be free-market money among the others.
There already exists numerous other competing cryptocurrencies, and more will come. Of course bitcoin is most the most used currently, but that might change.
People who think bitcoin as an investment usually don't like the idea of competing cryptocurrencies. I like the idea, since the most important thing about cryptocurrencies to me is the freedom in general, not "get-rich-quick" scheme or anything else.
@_date: 2015-09-30 09:52:52
Isn't it in my freedom to choose, who do I trust or not?
And for fact, I disagree with you. I don't see any problems losing $1 testing this kind of software, or losing $100 for that matter - I'm perfectly fine losing that money. It is my money, isn't the whole point of bitcoin that I can do whatever fucking stupid things I want with it.

There were at least couple of points I want to address. The first being the "bitcoins will vanish, because gradually people will lose their wallets, and there isn't new bitcoins coming in". This problem might not need solution at all, because bitcoins are divisible to 8 decimal places, and possibly to more in the future.
Secondly, the anonymity criticism. The guy was talking about the blogger, who kept one bitcoin address at his blog, so everyone can identify him. The thing is however, that bitcoin is as anonymous as you want to make it. You can generate a new bitcoin address for each of your blog visitor. As a business, you can generate a separate bitcoin address for each customer, then launder the bitcoins etc. So his argument that "businesses won't use bitcoins because of anonymity concerns" was wrong.

It is essential, but the profitability of mining isn't essential. If mining isn't profitable, there is just a bubble in mining - probably people will stop mining, and after a while mining is profitable again.
Imagine a scenario where people would start selling truckloads of sausages for bitcoins - I would gladly buy sausages with bitcoins, but if there were too much of sausage sellers, it wouldn't be a profitable business. After a while some sausage sellers would go out of business, and perhaps couple of them would survive and still make some bitcoins.
Mining is a bitcoin-generating business just like everything else, where you earn bitcoins for doing something. Mining just isn't very good business - there aren't any barriers of entry, everyone can start their own mining operation with very little capital, the competition is global, etc. It is no surprise that mining isn't profitable venture.

Why always the focusing on mining? Mining isn't the point of bitcoin, and if mining isn't profitable it isn't any kind of a problem for bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-22 12:44:25
Miners already fill the blocks with microtransactions, if there is a sufficient fee. I don't see how having the mining chip on the device solves that problem any differently. Anyway, thanks to the 1MB cap there is certain limit how well there microtransactions envisioned by 21inc would work.
Personally I prefer offchain transactions for microtransactions. I don't see why I would need high security provided by blockchain for the microtransactions, I would much more willingly save on fees and use offchain trust-based transactions. Of course it is just personal opinion.
@_date: 2015-09-30 10:08:36

ETF is audited and regulated much more strictly, it means that the fund has to hold the underlying instrument. ETN is just a debt note, meaning that whether and how the issuer manages the value risk is not known.
In practice ETF's have much better and broader audience, because ETN's are seen as very risky instruments. For example, I was able to buy ETF's from my online broker without hassle, but when I bought this ETN, I had to confirm seprately that I want to take this kind of risk etc, by agreeing on several uncomfortable sounding clausules.

Blockchain.info doesn't do any KYC at all. Also they have been doing features such as shared send to improve privacy (however the feature sucks, but that's beside the point).
Anyway, I think the original conspiracy theory blog post is pure bullshit. It is quite natural for bitcoin services to support BIP 101, because they live off bitcoin transactions. On the other hand, it is very natural for miners to support BIP 100, because it would mean more power to them.

The goverment wouldn't be able to inflate or tax its own version of bitcoin, but it could back its own cryptocurrency with goverment fiat money. People would choose it, because it would be more stable compared to bitcoin. In the longer term, the goverment-issued cryptocurrency would be similar to bitcoin. The goverment would control only initial (pre-mined) coins.

"That would be the day bitcoin is no longer useful as money."
Well... Things are not that simple. There are many ways to do transactions. There are many different tools which people consider "money", and some tools are considered better, some worse, and there is shitloads of subjective preferences as well.
So, I wouldn't shit my pants either way. Bitcoin can be useful for some transactions even as a currently. But it is clear that it isn't very useful for some other (legitimate) uses. The question is, will it be always this way or can bitcoin develop further to accommodate more use cases, or what will happen?
The obvious thing is, that bitcoin now is very different from bitcoin 5 years ago, when you could have zero-fee transactions in the chain in 10 minutes. That doesn't mean that bitcoin is useless, but just different. IN some other ways bitcoin is much more useful than 5 years ago, for example acceptance and liquidity.

This is interesting topic. Perhaps if some flaw is found from the main bitcoin, some alternative chain like tenebrix or litecoin might survive as the nest mainstream cryptocurrency.

IMO it doesn't make any sense to implement ideas like these on blockchain level. Start a service.

Promoting bitcoin as an investment is bad strategy imho, it should be promoted as a way to do business. We need more bitcoin startups, who sell products and services for bitcoins. Also bitcoin needs programmers, who build marketplaces and tools  to make it easier to sell and buy stuff for bitcoins. That way true adoption is built.
I don't see that the adoption will be fast, it takes time and some real work to build the required infrastructure so that bitcoin can be used by the common people. We aren't very near that point I think.

No. I don't save fiat money, I save with stocks &amp; investments. I don't treat currency as a form of investment, and I generally don't keep big cash reserve (5k euros max).
And of course I still would have "emergency cash reserve", like 500 euros, which I can get by a month if something radical happens.
Saving/investing with bitcoin could be difficult, I have yet to think about that.


The idea is to calculate all the costs &amp; keep accounting if the experiment is sensible or not. You can't know beforehand if it's worth the risk. But the risk of doing experiment like this for 3-4 months is not big.




I don't see why I should help the currency. Everyone is free to use bitcoins as they will, It's a free market. However I doubt that my experiment would affect the bitcoin price much. However, I plan to blog about it, so it might :)
And if my final calculations turn out to be profitable, how I am not being rational? Beforehand you can't know, it's risky, but afterwards you can calculate if it was worth the risk. And if that kind of lifestyle turns out to be profitable, then I'm going to continue it.

@_date: 2011-11-09 08:47:57


I think it doesn't, since pricing in bitcoins doesn't help the business itself. If bitcoin price goes up, no one is buying their overpriced services. If it goes down, the business is making loss because costs are still tied to USD. Unprofitable businesses aren't what bitcoin economy needs.
If you want to help the bitcoin economy that way, maybe tie the price to longer average, eg. instead of 24h average use one week average.

Well, it is baked in the protocol and has been there always.
And the mining revenue will drop.
In the longer term the revenue generated by transaction fees only might lead to "tragedy of the commons", where there is not enough incentive for miners to do solid, honest mining, and that could make the network an easy target for 51% attacks. But this is only speculation, time will tell better.

Yeah, by bleeding money from themselves. That would be stupid business-wise. Smart way would be to convince others why segwit actually is useful idea.
For one, I don't understand why any bitcoin-based altcoins haven't implemented segwit. I guess they just don't see value in it, and it is not worth the effort. For me it is equally difficult to grasp the value, it sounds like a big change which will cause a lot of work.
I think it would be smart to first wait some altcoins to implement segwit, and after that implement it for bitcoin.

I have thought about this problem a bit. Usually everyone wants to spend the currency which is less valuable. For example if I have euros and bitcoins, I want to spend the euros first because I believe that bitcoins will hold their value better. Of course if I can only pay with bitcoins, then I will pay with bitcoins.
The solution is to move all-in to bitcoin economy. I have been planning this a little bit, eg. convert all my paycheck to bitcoins each month, and then use only them. It would just need little more places where it is approved... Meanwhile I try to convert part of my paycheck to bitcoins every month and use them where I can.

What annoys me are statements like this:
"But Bitcoin fever seems to be on the wane right now, and the number of real-world places where Bitcoins can be spent is still, to a first approximation, zero."
OK, there was a huge bubble, and it seems to be over now. But the bitcoin value is still three times it was on april, 7 months ago. And the number of transactions have been stabilized to around 5000 per day.
People actually use bitcoin every day, and the trend doesn't seem to decline any more, it is more stable now. Previously people thought that bitcoin is some kind of "get-rich-quick"-scheme, which it isn't. It is great systems to transfer money with little costs, (possibly) anonymously and without a single 3rd party involved.

Real usage will eventually drive the price higher. Promote those handy android bitcoin apps (bitcoinspinner is the best currently IMHO). With them people can use bitcoin for cost sharing, small loans etc. If you have bitcoin-accepting restaurant in your town, visit it and take your friends with you.
And if you really want to drive the adoption further, start a bitcoin-based business. Or integrate your existing business to accept bitcoin as a payment.
Write guides how to use bitcoins. How should I hande bitcoins with my business? How should I handle my company accounting &amp; taxes if I use bitcoins?
Promotion is useless, if we haven't some actual real places where people can use bitcoins.

Why would they choose bitcoin? They could also invent their own cryptocurrency by starting another blockchain with different rules.
One way I could see is goverment starting their own blockchain: goverment "premines" goverment-coins so that the amount of premined coins equals current currency in circulation, and after that it is some kind of deflation. That way it would make sense for a goverment to endorse specific cryptocurrency.

I defined the question somewhat poorly. My question was, how the transaction is *actually seen in the interface* for various clients. For example, if I use an old version of electrum, and someone sends me a segwit transaction, will I see the transaction in the interface at all? If I see something, what actually is displayed? Also for other clients, how will each client display the transaction?
I think this is relevant, because when segwit deployment starts, people with old clients will probably be very confused when someone sends them segwit transactions. So it would be smart to research beforehand what kind of problems are to be excepted at client-level (eg. what is actually displayed to the end user).

I think reality is, that in hard fork situations most people will forget about ideological bullshit and instead do what makes economic sense. And that is staying on one chain.
The other chain might live but if miners can't sell the tokens mined on the losing chain very easily, they will stop mining. And if blocks are found very rarely, it is very difficult to sell those tokens, even if exchanges added support for them.

For those who run business of course it makes sense to optimize the transaction costs more. Often you can also accept lower confirmations etc. All the transfers are probably quite similar etc.
However for casual user the case is different. You might have varying needs depending on how you are using btc. You might be buying a game from internet where you want to play it ASAP but seller requires 1conf, you might be doing physical order where it doesn't matter whether the transaction confirms in a day, etc. It doesn't really make sense to calculate and optimize the fee for each transaction, because time and hassle is valuable as well. Consumers would probably prefer it to "just work" with some predictable fee.

I would prefer some other way like bitcoin-xt, where transactions are removed from mempool in some semi-random-way. That way you could effectively limit the mempool to some comfortable size, like one gigabyte. Or ten gigabytes, if you have more resources to spare. With the minimum relay fee, it is more difficult to see what kind of mempool size it results to, and the spammer might just increase the fees and you still have the same problem.

Well they might be deposited directly to an exchange, and could go to a cold wallet... Or might continue to another exchange via a entirely different user, etc.
On a quick glance, it looks like most pools are moving the coins quite quickly away to another address after mining them. That probably makes sense even if you aren't selling, just for privacy. BTCC is depositing the coins directly to their "physical bitcoin" addresses, which will resell (recently launched product). Bitfury has balance of ~3800 BTC in their mining address.
I'm pretty sure that there is decent amount of running costs in bitcoin mining operations, so they need to sell at least portion of the coins.

"keeps your money in Philippino Pesos"
LOL, is this a joke or what? Why on earth would anyone want to hold pesos over btc? What's the point anyway using bitcoin if you want to hold pesos... There exists already many services for transfering pesos, I doubt this can compete with the easiness &amp; fees.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:40:18


At least where I live, money transmission is a cost center for banks. Profit is made with other services. Some regulations limit on how much bank can charge on money transfers.
I agree that banking will always exist, but also for the reason that many people have a preference to make their money transfers via a service.
@_date: 2015-10-26 11:21:00
I'm talking about the convenience part: developing easy-to-use, convenient, effortless user interfaces is very hard work, and those who can do that usually make shitloads of money with that skill. How do we get this "convenient" user inter interfaces for these apps?
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:26:22
Well whatever the hard part is, I think it is freaking difficult to create something like eBay, so that my mom could use it. And also network effects, as you mentioned with skype. Even if you would create cheaper and better alternative to ebay, how would people find it?
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:04:50
I would understand remittance as a wealth transfer between different countries, typically those who have very incompatible finance infrastructures. It doesn't necessarily really mean fiat. I bet typical remittance users would be happy to transfer for example gold as well, or something else valuable, if that were possible.

Someone could just start cash-to-btc service, and offer it alongside multisig etc consultation to dispensaries. I'm pretty sure that at least couple of them would start to be customers.
Of course the problem is, how to convert all that cash to btc, and then again, how to use the btc to pay bills and other expenses for the business. In EU it is very easy and cheap to pay your bills using BTC with various services, but I don't know about US.

Hmm yeah, probably most tor nodes are paid by businesses that use the protocol for themselves.

I think that was minority. The thing was that computers were fucking expensive. I'm pretty sure most would bought one if it were shitloads cheaper, and most saw the use cases.

I'm just saying this is also fault of the person who just deposits money to random account without knowing who is selling etc.
The bitcoint rader can however easily migitate this, by asking a picture from the receipt, hand-written "for bitcoins" over it. However I guess some people would be stupid enough even then to deposit the funds.

Make bitcoin extension to bittorrent. Define couple new message types, that allow requesting and sending btc between peers. No need for complicated UI or something like joystream, just modify some existing command line client and define the protocol. If markets catch on, probably other developers will also start developing their clients.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:27:53
You could also run the node as a pruning node without external hard drive - I guess that would make it even cheaper. However I don't know how useful pruning nodes are generally to the network.
@_date: 2015-10-26 11:32:30
The seeding is nowadays altruistic anyway, why would the altruistic seeders disappear once paid seeders came in to play? Also the most seeding is done by leechers anyway. No one is doing seeding professionally. I guess the biggest seeders are those, who forget to turn their torrent clients off.
I think joystream (or similar open source technology) could tremendously increase availability of niche content. That would be very cool.

Mostly that they stopped development &amp; support.
I think it is a very simple question of incentives. Many people start businesses with too ideological goals, and don't think too much about the bottom line. I think that was the problem with skyhook - their profit margin was too small, and at some point your ideological fuel runs out and you move on to some stuff that makes sense.
This ATM might have a better profit margin, but I'm still somewhat sceptical at the price point. Good luck they have support product priced separately.

The title is stupid, if bitcoin is traded then it has a nonzero price. Or any commodity/instrument that is traded has nonzero price. The bad scenario is not a nonzero price, but illiquidity. In programming term NaN. For example, a scenario where bitcoin transactions can't be made for some technical reason (I have no idea what that technical reason could be, and I'm not saying there is one).

I guess all ETF:s are different, since they hold different instruments/commodities/etc? The problem with establishing bitcoin ETF is that the regulators who regulate ETF:s have no clue what this bitcoin thing is...
@_date: 2015-02-16 09:18:59


In mainstream finance, running a fractional reserve is kind of standard practice. Very probably bitcoin ETF would be doing that as well. However, myself I don't see a problem. As long as it works, and the ETF is somehow convertible to bitcoin (at least by some limited group of accredited investors), it would be very useful.
Many banks have been around for hundred years, and doing heavy fractional reserve. Despite that, they still are up and running and still provide valuable service to everyone.
@_date: 2011-08-22 13:11:31
To my understanding, there isn't any legislation. Most countries have laws against private paper currencies, but bitcoin is a different beast.

The api is not the best one designed, but it is usable. In fact, it is pretty difficult to make very difficult api for an exchange. I would say it is usable. I have a basic bot that I use for selling, and it was not that many lines of code, and was made in few hours.

@_date: 2015-10-26 07:21:48
Of course it is a little bit of apples to oranges comparison, but the things I see currently:
1. Bitcoin is used globally in every country of the world
2. Bitcoin usage is growing steadily (at least according to the data sources I follow)
3. Bitcoin technology is very resilient, it is not going away
4. Number of bitcoin companies/startups and how much they have been receiving funding is growing steadily. Instead of single "unicorns", bitcoin has its entire ecosystem.

@_date: 2015-10-07 00:02:20
How so? Please elaborate. I have personally been using bitcoin for quite a long time, and there have been times when a) actually you make transaction, but the transactions doesn't go through as fasta as you excepted, because blocks are full and b) you have to raise your fees significantly, if you want to have the transaction in blockchain as fast as you want, for the same reason.
If usage increases significantly, I don't see any reason why we wouldn't have the same problems (eg. fuller blocks).
(btw also quite disappointed that this reddit upvotes blatant blaming with no rational argumentation...)
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:43:05
How likely it is for the bip148 tokens to have enough active mining? Will be quite difficult anyway id there is only very small amount of hashing power mining that fork anyway. Currently AFAIK no miners support bip148. So the first difficulty will be getting any blocks for the fork.

Btw how much will it cost?
@_date: 2015-10-13 11:39:07
Can anyone explain, how this improves liquidity without tying capital? As I understand, you need to send traditional btc to the sidechain, and then you can do instant transfers there. Sending btc to the other service takes the same amount of time, and ties the same amount of capital. Just by quick thought...
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:37:15
At least in finland this has been possible for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:15:55
I think you have circle logic there. To know the price, miners need the token to be traded on exchanges. Exchanges need miners to confirm deposits/withdrawals to allow trading. There seems to be neither miners or exchanges supporting bip148 tokens, so I think it will fail with a probability of 98,5%.
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:30:29
Nope, that would mean less volume probably. But usually as volatility increases volumes increase as well, because of speculation.

It would be very stupid not to pay tax, if you use regulated bitcoin broker such as coinbase etc. Those probably give a lot of information to the goverment.
I guess if you only only use bitcoin-only services, and never touch fiat currency, then it is pretty difficult to be on radar. However I guess everyone trades BTC to fiat or back now and then.

Definitely not plain and simple, the resulting behaviour would be very different for different cryptocurrencies. Depends heavily on difficulty adjustment algorithm and on block creation time. See my post above:

Coinbase doesn't not broadcast ETHC. It might have done in the past, but these talks that they are insolvent etc are clear FUD. They have not stated that they will take deposited ETHC, they have just stated that don't deposit ETHC to coinbase.
Coinbase owners might have stupid opinions, but they are not idiots. I'm pretty sure they have a grasp of the situation. For some reasons some people just want to spread unnecessary FUD about the situation.
What I would suggest is not to move any ETH or ETHC you have, until you are sure what you are doing. If you had pre-fork ETH, just wait a week or two before taking action. And if you decide to move those coins, split them to different accounts before doing anything to be sure.
(I have never touched any ETH or ETHC myself)

@_date: 2016-07-27 08:33:46
Them not crediting ETC is not in any way a proof that they are broadcasting ETC. You are spreading FUD.
It is very easy to separate the ETC from ETH using the splitter contract mentioned in the blog post below. I don't see any reason why coinbase wouldn't be doing that.

This kind of governance has existed long before fiat currencies, I don't see how that would change with bitcoin or cryptos. You just need group of people agreeing on how to use the violence, and them destroying systematically competing violent groups. Your claim sounds like some weird libertarian fantasy, little bit similar to some zeitgeist communist fantasy.

There have been reports that it was possible to withdraw ETC earlier, but not any more, and withdrawals seem not to broadcast ETC any more. Also reported was delays in withdrawals, which indicates that they upgraded their infrastructure to disable ETC withdrawals. Based on this twitter report: 
You can easily prove otherwise by pointing out a recent report where someone managed to withdraw ETC from coinbase. If you find one, please point to it. Or prove it yourself by doing a succesful ETC withdrawal from coinbase.

I wouldn't say that. Ethereum is still very different beast to BTC and the hard fork would have behaved very differently in BTC. Bitcoin has 10 minute block time, ethereum has 15 seconds. Bitcoin has 2 weeks difficulty adjustment time, ethereum adjusts it on each block. With bitcoin having similar hard fork initially, we would probably still be waiting for a second block on the older chain, and it would be impossible for anyone to operate on the old chain.
Also, many of the problems with ethereum hard fork would be very easy to migitate, for example having a version number included in transactions before signatures are applied, which would make all transactions in the fork invalid in the older chain, and vice versa.

Not really "ton of legitimate users". Mainstream probably doesn't jailbreak. And anyway it's his app, let him do as he wishes...
@_date: 2016-07-27 11:40:45
The statements simplifying the situation are still stupid. If similar scenario would have happened with bitcoin, with the initial hash rate distribution we would have been waiting 7 hours for the first block in the losing chain. This would create very different environment for using the old chain, doing replay attacks etc.
Also the comparison is stupid for other reasons as well. The ethereum hard fork was done for very dubious reasons and had to be done within 5 days preparation time (because the hacker DAO funds were timelocked). It is quite a stupid to assume that other hard forks would be be planned and executed in such a fashion. And ethereum blockchain itself is about one year old...
If we are nitpicking, the statement is true that hard fork will always result to there being multiple chains. But the harms of the many chains wouldn't be in any way comparable to the current ethereum clusterfuck. For example, anyone can fork off the bitcoin chain as well anytime, and claim that as the "real bitcoin", and maybe even mine it with big mining farms as well. That wouldn't be much of a problem for bitcoin.

Both chains would survive, but the minority chain probably wouldn't be any kind of issue for anyone.

Well your thought process just seems weird. You're worrying about exchanges suspending trading, when they haven't even added added bip148 tokens. So it looks like your whole logic is just wishful thinking.
Also please note that mined bitcoins are only valid after 120 confirmations. So it would be extra risky for miners to mine the minority chain if blocks came very rarely.
@_date: 2017-06-16 21:46:39
This is just bad propaganda. The most likely is that bip148 fork won't get any mining power. However if it gets some minority mining power, it is trivial to protect youself from the reorg risk with a checkpoint.

"By all means use bitcoin as a transaction mechanism, but if your expenses are in $ then you should hold $."
Bitcoin is quite convertible - it is really easy to convert it to fiat currencies when you need. There is slight tone in your original text implying that people should hold $ because of illiquidity.
The exchange rate risk is of course there, but I don't think that you should keep your assets in USD or BTC because your expenses are in USD or BTC. Bitcoin is liquid these days, it doesn't take too much effort to convert those currencies back and forth. Of course it created extra hassle for accounting as well, but that is different argument as well.
@_date: 2016-07-27 08:39:12
"ETC is not supported" is not the same as stating "we will steal your ETC". They don't have ETC accounts so it makes sense to ask people not to deposit any ETC.


OK, do you work for coinbase? I doubt that you know much about their internal technology. Even if they have some custom ethereum wallet, it should still be very easy to use that splitter contract. If they are not able to do that (which I doubt), they should just halt the withdrawals. I think they did that earlier since people reported delays in withdrawals.
Anyway, I suspect that I'm talking with a FUD-spreading troll.

I think not complaining is part of capitalism. Most companies welcome negative feedback. Some don't. Although fees are something people will always complain about, even if they are miniscule. You see now and then complaints about bitcoin network fees, and they are less than dollar-cent.
@_date: 2013-02-11 11:03:44
Note that also the larger the transaction, the higher fee is required. So if your affiliates collect thousand of 0.001 BTC transactions, it is much, much worse than receiving one 1 BTC transaction. When you have lots of small transactions, it takes size in the blockchain to spend those, and you have to pay higher transaction fee.

I have cold wallet, but I very rarely spend more than I have in my hot wallet. And when I do, it is probably some bigger purchase where I want to compare the prices even more strictly.
Generally speaking spending with strategy "what do I have money for" sounds stupid idea just with any currency. But just my opinion, of course everyone is free to spend their money as they wish.

Do you have any info what funding/withdrawal methods are available? And because they seem to be shouting "compliance" all along, how many ID's and utility bills I have to send to actually trade there?
To me it seems that some of these startups don't understand at all what the customer really needs. The compliance benefits typical customer only indirectly. As far as I see, the most important is the liquidity of the exchange, eg. how quick it is to get money in, money out and what is the price inside exchange.

It is very difficult to know why the exchanges have actually failed. Personally I think that running the exchange has to be solid business, since it is very risky area in every sense (regulatory environment, technological security, etc.). The "low fees with huge volume" sounds more like fantasy with no solid business sense. And yeah, VC companies like to throw money around without wanting return for their investments.

Especially in India and 3rd world countries the speculation/investor market comes first, and then the remittance market. Everyone knows how crappy/inflatory the currencies in these countries are. Also they tend to have lots of currency controls, recently India banned gold imports. So the people have appetite for Bitcoins. Knowing that you can convert those bitcoins to other property easily in western countries helps as well.
After you have the speculation market, it is easy to use Bitcoin for remittance as well.

One alternative would be to cash out BTC using OTC trades:
@_date: 2013-01-03 15:22:59
If you have mtgox account, you can jsut transfer the bitcoins anywhere from there. Just type bitcoin address, amount and press send (or withdraw, whatever it is). All bitcoin services are compatible with each other, so it doesn't matter where you buy your bitcoins, you can spend them everywhere.
If by reddit wallet you mean the reddit bitcointip bot, you just send message "withdraw bitcoinaddress amount" to the bot.

Hi, nope, the transaction service can be used without enabling the escrow. And the feedback is confirmed also if the transaction system is used.
Leo had a small mistake there, confusing the escrow and transaction service. Transaction is useful for local cash trades, and it can be cancelled by both parties at any time - it can also be easily released on the spot, so there is no reason to separately enable the escrow. Our site also says that "request to enable escrow _if paying online_" on the contact page. We have to train our staff better to know this difference.

1. Security. People are fearful, and for the right reason. It is very easy to lose your bitcoins, since secure and easy methods for storing &amp; using them do not exist yet.
2. Difficult of use. It is difficult to grasp, how to buy them in a way where you can't be screwed. At the same time buyers also want good prices - they don't know why would be a good time to buy etc.
Also with precious metals, there are also high transaction costs, difficult/expensive to check validity, bad divisibility, high transfer costs in addition to the other problems.

Nah I copied the lines from the emails and haven't edited the message.
Seriously I (or anyone else from localbitcoins staff) would never use wording "Fuck off" in a customer email. I can only see two possible explanations:
1. It was an really elaborate scam, where you were led to change emails with someone else who you thought was localbitcoins support. And for some reason you didn't receive those two emails I sent to you. That would be quite a coincidence.
2. You are making this up

The correct protection from this is not to use the escrow for local transactions. There really isn't reason for it, as cash and bitcoins can be exchanged on the spot at same time. We never suggest using escrow in our interface for local transactions. It is possible to enable escrow for trades opened via local form, because many want to complete the transaction online even if initially planning for local transaction.
The lesson learned, we have still lots to do with our interface/processes/dispute resolution/communications.

The percentages are same as elsewhere else. Mining is taxed as income (progressive taxation). Rate fluctuation gains are taxed the same way as stock eg, as capital gains (28% or something, I don't remember). However you can't deduct losses from rate fluctuations as far as I understand. You also can't deduct anything else, such as purchases on mining equipment etc.

The fact that using this service, you can only receive bitcoins, not spend them. You can receive bitcoins directly to your tinfoil-hat offline setup.

Hi, I examined your case.
In the case we had sent 2 emails asking you for further clarification while the bitcoins were still in escrow. In the first email you sent, it wasn't clear at all that you had paid the seller (it mainly consisted of you accusing us scammers right away while the bitcoins were still in escrow). Then we asked for further clarifications in two emails, but we didn't get any reply. The seller claimed not receiving any payment. After 4 days without reply we had resolved the case for seller, since we didn't get any messages from you.
Well I guess the emails could have been left along the way, or you didn't receive them. Or otherwise the texts were unclear. However we hadn't much troubles with others.

1) No, you generate new addresses for incoming transactions - for better privacy.
2) Yep.
3) Yep.
Multiple addresses are mainly used for better privacy &amp; anonymity. It is not that serious if you use only single address, if you are not concerned about privacy.

These cases seems to point to the direction that mtgox is having actual fiat liquidity problems. In other words, they are not having enough fiat money in their bank accounts, so that they play some game, processing low amount withdrawals eg.

It is pretty weird that you are the only one reporting this bug from our 50k users. However, of course it can still be theorically possible that there exists some kind of weird edge case. We are very careful with our processes, and do not bypass them on slight reasons for security reasons.
Your account was already put on holiday, so there should be no problems with the new requests.
We've had similar support case in the past - we spent several hours trying to figure out if there might be a bug. In the end it turned out that the person trying to log out had forgot that he had 2FA auth enabled, and tried just to log in leaving the 2FA auth field empty. 
We will think what to do in this case. Meanwhile, try resetting the password once more time, and also try logging in both with your username and email.

They make 1% from each transaction. If they lose one transaction because of fraud, they lose 100%, they have to do 100 similar transactions to cover the loss. I'm pretty sure losing some customers is less expensive than losing money because of fraud, for their business...

What is the long-term goal of linux community? Very diverse. Most are just using the software as a tool for their own purposes. Some are developing the software for fun. Some are developing the software for ideological reasons. I guess most are developing it because they need the functionality for themselves and then also don't mind sharing it with each other.
I don't see bitcoin that much different. Just that we have much more "marketers" than linux, because bitcoin project can financially reward the early adopters if it becomes more widespread.

There seems to be lots of newbies who have the same faulty logic for some reason, that more mining power equals more coins. That isn't the case. The amount of new coins stays constant, with mining power you can just gain bigger share of those coins. I don't know why this is so common misconception.

The answer: reputation systems.
Reputable users earn more bang &amp; buck from their servers. You can use the providers with less trust for less-sensitive tasks. Naturally the providers with less reputation would be cheaper.

There doesn't exist very good reputation systems. For example, it requires quite a time to research an online shop, if it is reputable. And even then the reviews might be faked.
Better protection is escrow service like on bitmit.net.

Primarily investments/savings and inflation-protection. My saving strategy is to pick invidual stocks and invest in my own business. However, it usually takes long time to find good investments, and keeping fiat on a bank account for a long time is bad, because of inflation. So I'll try to keep most of my money in bitcoin. It doesn't require huge effort to change bitcoins back and forth, therefore I find this strategy good.

Can you elaborate how this is done in practice? I haven't thought that this would be possible, but then again I'm not expert on ECDSA. So if you have two public keys from the same series, they can be used to generate all the addresses in the series?
Note that no master public key is published.
However, some way to combat the problem: empty the invidual tx outputs separately to a mixer, and then use them. Mix the addresses to a traditional bitcoin wallet, and then use them. Etc etc.
@_date: 2013-01-22 18:02:25
Yeah, touting the lack of fraud is somewhat misleading. Seller fraud is very common in the bitcoin economy. Escrow usage or other protection is recommended.

Nothing. You are not actually meant to to share the URL Julian702 shared, it is the private "main" page. To request payments, you are supposed to share the public payment URL: 
You can safely share that page. The main page can be used to monitor payments real-time.
However there isn't much harm sharing the public main page - just that now everyone can request payments for Julian702, and everyone knows his master public key and all the related bitcoin addresses - not much privacy. But I guess he created that one just for demonstration purposes :)

I'm not sure you understand how it works. You double-spend the coins you lost, and keep the winnings. So the satoshidice spending the transaction doesn't help. Essentially they should wait for the first confirmation and announce the results then.

That is the automatic email we send when a dispute is filed. I guess our wording is bad or something, but others haven't had that much problem with it.
We enquiry both sides of evidence. If you don't claim or communicate anything, it is pretty difficult for us to decide in your favour. If only other party is claiming something, then we are deciding for the favour of the other party. Note that there was in this case 5 days for you to reply something. You didn't reply anything.
The fact is that there are lots of people creating accounts, then buying some bitcoins with escrow, and then not communicating anything. How fucking hard is it to reply to those fucking emails? Seriously?
You are implying here, that we should freeze the bitcoins for _more than five days_ if the buyer doesn't even claim or communicate anything. That's even different from having an evidence. Five days is very long time in bitcoin land.
I take these messages as a proof that you received those emails, but for some reason didn't reply anything. Like decided that we want to scam you from the first email. We didn't have any monetary reward from this, we don't charge any fee from the escrow disputes.

I agree we made a rushed decision. We reversed the decision, since the buyer was willing to wait for more evidence and was not in a rush, like the seller. We will wait 7 more days.
Please note that we also have more evidence from the buyer, than is told here. Only the seller's side is presented here.

Well that's the problem with modern economy - traditional jobs don't pay well, because they bring less and less value for the market, the end users, consumers. On the other hand, if you start a global startup or partake in some global new phenomenon such as bitcoin, you can get insane amount of wealth with relatively little effort. That's mostly because in the latter case you are connected to a bigger market, but of course it is more complicated than that.

It is also safe, because of the escrow function.
@_date: 2013-07-31 11:57:37
We added the option there, because lots of traders were contacting through local form, and then actually doing online transaction. This caused lots of pain for some newbies, who were tricked in believing the transaction is escrow, when it actually isn't, and then the scammer seller canceled the transaction. So the button was designed to fix one problem, and ended up causing another.
We will fix this by enforcing the divide of online/local more clearly in the interface.

The escrow isn't needed in local transactions in the first place. We have designed the system in a way, where the bitcoins should be releasable at the same time always with the cash transactions. Probably our guides aren't very clear, but in this case the seller shouldn't haven't enabled the escrow in the first place, as it is for the online trade. And of course the buyer shouldn't just pay without requesting the release code from the seller. So bitcoins and cash should be swapped at the same time.

Hi, Jeremias from Localbitcoins here. I haven't yet researched the case in full detail, but it sounds like high-risk situation to us, security wise. We can't just simply provide access to user accounts on very slight basis, since it has high risk that we might provide the access to a wrong person. It is unfortunate, but our policy is to be extra-careful with this.
The support can put your ads on holiday, so you won't be getting any request (this however only if the account really has been inactive). If this hasn't already been done, send your username to me as a private message.
The login process should not take any stance whether 2FA is enabled or not. It first checks the username/password, and only after that checks if 2FA is enabled or not. So it should be the problem with passwd. I suggest trying the email reset a couple of more times using different setups (browsers etc).

Sorry for the poor communication. Currently we don't need anything from you.
I need to consult others on this case, as it is more complicated. Sorry for the delay.

I wasn't suggesting that, I just speculated that if they have decided to run with the money, why would they give one week warning at all...

research chemicals first, real drugs later?

LOL it doesn't work like that. If there were any patterns, it would be extremely easy to make money out of them. I think that even weekend dip is was more like a joke. (However I have not studied it.)

Btw, could this be easily implemented to bitcoind api, eg encrypt and decrypt commands?

I think that the best thing about Diamond Age was that it didn't describe utopia, or neither dystopia. The world it described was something in between.

What about holding $ enough to cover the expenses &amp; little extra, and keep the remainder in BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:04:54
It is more like that we currently have fiat-mania, then people will realize how worthless fiat money is and turn to bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies.

There seems to be lot of confident gox fanboys here, who seem to think that they are solvent, that's why I created the topic. I personally am sceptical that they are solvent.
@_date: 2013-09-29 10:22:42
It took me something like 3-4 months getting my order. I think the best solution is to demand refund/shipping, and wait, and never to use coinabul again.
After I tried couple of silver/gold webshops, I really got convinced that bitcoin isn't usable for consumer grade online purchases... Unless if escrow is used.
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:51:11
I'll include the email conversation here:
Your first email, the seller had disputed the escrow, and we were receiving arguments from both sides:
"LocalBitcoins is worthless if the allow members to scam others with no opportunity to give negative feedback."
Our first reply:
"Hi, the dispute is still going on, the feedback will enabled after it is resolved. This just means that the seller has pressed the "dispute" button and sent the case resolvation to us. Can you please explain what happened? Did you pay succesfully?"
Our second enquiry day after, when we hadn't received any reply:
"Hi, can you please comment on this? What happened and why you aren't happy? The bitcoins are still in escrow and the seller requested cancellation."
According to our records, we received only the first email from you. Since we didn't get any more emails, and the seller claimed not receiving any form of payment, we resolved the case to the seller.
@_date: 2013-02-11 09:44:12
The fee is optional, but if you set it to zero bitcoins, your payment might not get through very fast.
@_date: 2013-06-21 05:19:12
LocalBitcoins.com is payment method agnostic - buyers and sellers can list any payment methods there. Many use cash deposits.
Many electronic transfer methods are very unsafe for bitcoin trade, because they are reversible (and banks/payment processors will reverse the payment happily when they hear "bitcoin").
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:32:30
Well, the buyer insisted taking the case to the police, and waiting for the tapes from the Starbucks.
Edit: I didn't say that we are doing any decisions based on that. Just to know that this makes us undeciseful about the situation.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:39:23
Hi, Jeremias from Localbitcoins here. Can you supply your contact ID so I can research the situation?
edit: Also note, that nowadays all funding goes through localbitcoins wallet. So after sending the bitcoins, you have also to press the "fund transaction" button. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 03:29:52
Well I agree that asking the drivers licence/ID proof in this case was probably unnecessary. But please note that this is also first this kind of case we have to handle. You are not supposed to suppose put the escrow on for local cash trades, so we are not handling this type of disputes usually. We have kind of problem here since the buyer has said he wants to bring the case to the police/wants the starbucks tapes. So we are mostly researching if we should wait for those, and what is our liabilities in this kind of case.
@_date: 2013-08-19 07:18:25
LOL, you can't be serious. How come all the other exchanges are still below 20%? This can't be anything else than a bank run. The worse for Bitcoin that it happens to cover 75% of the market.

Well, you can't find the donation button inside the site. I actually just downloaded newest calibre, then remembered that it probably had donations, tried to search for donation button but all just took me directly to paypal. So they don't seem to link to that page anywhere.
@_date: 2013-05-11 06:24:11
How are they able to offer this kind of deal? I think this is suspicious.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:54:07
The devs. But you are free to modify the transaction fee to suit your preferences. It is voluntary.
@_date: 2013-08-26 07:05:57
BTW the idea of Bitcoin isn't that people cooperate for consensus. The idea of block chain is that either you cooperate in the rules defined by the protocol, or you are out. Reaching consensus by traditional methods is much more difficult than gaining consensus via proof-of-work.

Goverments will always find ways to tax, at least the physical stuff. Information is much harder to tax.
I don't see that goverments would lose the ability to tax and regulate the commerce in general, the commerce of physical stuff. But for IPR and immaterial trading, taxation is going to be lot more difficult.

There are bots bruteforcing almost every BTC site in existence... You should really enable 2factor for every bitcoin site you use. And even then, it might not help if you have malware on your computer.

Good marketing is always important. Just spread the word properly, if you are planning to start an event like that. Use facebook, meetup.com and other social media sites, etc.

LOL, like anyone can stop anyone from speaking on "our" behalf. There is no "us" either, deal with it. The idea of Bitcoin is that everyone cares for their own shit.

For US consumers yes. But imagine a foreign business which wants to bill a customer in US. Usually the way would be to go with paypal or SWIFT transfers.
Theoretically this kind of service could enable companies/inviduals to operate without bank accounts at all.

Come on, the demand for coin in/coin out is pretty good, you shouldn't do it for philanthropy. And after all you are supporting those who probably don't need the philanthropy. Better make some profit and give the profit to Seans Outpost :)

Hmm ok. Now it is word against word. I would not use such a wording with a customer, that would be asking for some serious trouble. I'm pretty sure that my friends, and the people from the bitcoin community (which many I have met personally at conferences etc) know that. I have not sent a single support email with "Fuck off".
@_date: 2013-07-31 06:03:34
Hi, can you please still provide the SMS messages you sent with the buyer. Even if it can be faked, it is worth providing in my opinion. We want to make as informed decision as possible.
It is fairly easy to take screencaps from the SMS messages on modern phones. If your phone does not support it, just type them in.
@_date: 2013-12-29 15:12:30
Nah, it doesn't work like that as far as I have heard. The merchant still takes the risk from a double-spend, not bitpay.
@_date: 2013-03-01 14:42:48
That is just the human nature. People will buy high and sell low.

In SGD, I don't see how this is news... Many local exchanges for small currencies are outgrowing mtgox on daily basis. For example, localbitcoins has GBP market cornered, PLN is cornered by bitcurex etc. It is pretty easy to win mtgox on small markets.

Off-topic. It is pain in the arse to have this ideological babble in every tax-related topic/thread. Most people are interested about the practical stuff, and that is the most rational strategy IMHO.

I have heard couple of times, that if you transact less than $1000/day, it is legal. However can't say if it is true.
For example the $1000 amount was stated here:

This user was using the new escrow feature, which is designed for bank transfers. However only enabled by couple of sellers for now.

LocalBitcoins.com working as usual.
