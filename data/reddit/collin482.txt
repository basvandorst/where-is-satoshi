There's no such thing as a rights respecting government. By virtue of its existence a government must enforce a monopoly through violence and fund itself through theft. Not only this but governments are and have been for some time the most egregious violators of rights. Civilian on civilian crime is nothing when compared to government on civilian crime. At the very least criminals don't generally slaughter millions of people at a time.

If you want to learn about the issue you can watch the video or I'll be more than happy to direct you to some literature, but I get the feeling that time any time I spend trying to educate you is time wasted. If for whatever reason you're only comfortable obtaining information through comments on reddit you should make a post on there are plenty of people there who will be able to answer your questions and who are far more patient than I am.

I don't have to, I could provide a relatively detailed explanation if need be but I've done this sort of thing way too much already. It's tedious providing the same answers for the same questions again and again, the video I directed you to is simply a convenient means of outlining the basics. If you're not willing to take 10 minutes of your time to understand a few simple concepts I question whether you want to understand the other side of the argument at all.
