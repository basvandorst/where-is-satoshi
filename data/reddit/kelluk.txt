When I hear someone saying those words I wonder whether they have taken the time to actually read about the technology behind crypto.
'complex code':
that could be a description for Codes all over the world describing how the financial systems should work. Try reading that being a layman!
As in the case of bitcoin - you need another person who will explain to you what those terms mean and how you should obey them.
'without accountability':
In what way? Is there anyone accountable if I use or lose a dollar? Maybe what was meant was a guarantee? Cause the state is the guarantee of the coin they produce/ maintain. Even so, the state cannot guarantee the value of the money but it can manipulate it by printing more of it.  
In the case of bitcoin - there is a limited amount and no one can manipulate that.

I wonder: what does it mean to you that the CEO of Google says that?

Makesense.org is a community (that I am part of) supporting social entrepreneurs, collaborating with governments, corporates and citizens to make solving social problems sustainable. We recently launched a global campaign to support tech solving social issues and one of the technologies is the blockchain. It s a community full of happy people that make changing the world a fun experience. Being part of the community really changed the way I see ngos, look at world and make decision what I want to focus on.

Agreed. That s why we need to educate people, spread our knowledge. I ve done this with tens if not more people in the past 5 months. And I always try to explain it in plain language, with examples, with use cases. I also say it s still in its early days but it has a lot of potential. And then I often follow up and send people good articles on the topic so they don't read all the crap that you can find on the Internet or, worse, on the television.
Let's educate ourselves and our communities!

crypto assets. In my view they are new types of assets that we are now learning how to price.
