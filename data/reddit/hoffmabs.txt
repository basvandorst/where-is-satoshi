Simply: no. You can't restore password over email on that wallet service.
This company scams people into fooling people that email is going to restore something

Since fiat cash will be paid for a product which you will deliver, its gonna work with only cheap items with initial cost less than $5 (which are usually useless to deliver because too small) - and with some motivation for buyer to pay less Bitcoins when he is agrees to keep the item.
(The person who is going to bring $5 item - already will know that his chances to sell this item is 50/50 and that he covers the amount of that little purchase on his own risk)
