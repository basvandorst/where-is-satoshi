I always go with no

Oh shit that's supposed to be cryptocurrency

Calculator finds most profitable coin and sends work to the miners.

I wouldn't be scared of coinbase. But gox have always had their issues and has never really been trusted by me. I wouldn't link my bank account to BTC-e either
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:55:54
Multipool it's the one I use, but btc guild also has one in the beta stages called scryptguild, and middlecoin. There are also a couple others, but I can't remember them off the top of my head.

the point was making one type of terminal and, no modification allowed whatsoever by third-partys... of cource hacking it will be a problem but it is a problem in other terminals too...

I can't stress that enough. Samsung also makes ugly touchwiz.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:10:38
It's a "yay" because bitcoin somehow doesn't use it and therefore dodged the bullet that would kill bitcoin itself as your private key could be cracked

Seeing as we have discussed quantum physics, different sciences and all kinds of stuff, I was pretty blown away by his ignorance
@_date: 2013-06-22 07:04:35
Yes, I did take the PayPal fee example. I even pulled the non refundable stuff.
He didn't know what inflation was, and I've done a lot of reading on the subject.
So I challenged him to look things up on the bitcoin wiki, of course that is advertisement and lies he said. At which point I'm doubting he got the whole decentralized P2P thing...
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:20:30
I'm sorry, but aren't we shooting for a decentralized economy? Why shouldn't 15 year olds be allowed to buy whatever they want?
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:34:07
He's an otherwise open person, but when I put out the Open Source, Decentralized, P2P, he just said it was a currency and that it wasn't important.
Bitcoin is the best example of everything I support. We've had discussions before but this one actually made me want to throw up...
THE ONLY thing that's the same for those two things Is that it's virtual, and have value.
@_date: 2013-03-08 21:11:30
I hadn't heard about those coins before now! wish I had some bitcoins to tip!
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:52:50
Yup, just was told "it's a currency, it doesn't matter"
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:58:50
I wasn't really pushing, I told him How great it was that we got the front page of metro, which turned him interested. And then he drew a conclusion, tf2 hats=bitcoins.
This isn't necessary bad, but when I explained all the differences, with high security, decentralization, p2p, etc. That's when hell broke loose, he denied the importance of decentralization, p2p and Open Source. 
Which have me wondering if he just can't admit losing.

I don't think all of blockchain is compromised, the thiefs left a fraction of it. two adresses was not stolen from
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:04:22
Yes, pretty much. You could work around this by sending all the change to a new address
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:23:24
Basically the random number generator isn't really random (like everything with computers) and in the code the seeds for the random is implemented. And if you know some special numbers you can calculate and decrypt the hash.
This article  is an excellent read on the subject.
It's quite brilliantly hidden as the seed could've been anything, and that that one was picked could be innocent. But it doesn't look that way on further inspection.
Luckily we don't seem to be affected as we use a completely different system

Got my key today.

There is a pretty huge difference in it
but sure! I'm oppinioneted
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:15:58
I guess it's defendable for that reason.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:11:03
It wasn't a buy/sell, more of an account issue, resolved in less than 24 Hours!
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:52:05
Good idea!

Too bad the app is unavailable in Norway
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:07:37
nope, I'm an user :P, I'm not sure how to prove it.
I was really impressed!
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:37:30
Try to buy some with blockchain.info?
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:34:12
Great! I didn't think of that! Thanks
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:13:14
Except it was open source. People just weren't paranoid enough
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:57:51
I think it coming in shouldn't be looped, but the little shine through the logo would be pretty cool imo
@_date: 2013-06-22 15:48:49
Actually, I just wanted help on things that were different... I don't know much about the tf2 economy so I was wondering if there was anything else I could say
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:50:57
I think it could use the blockchain to do this! it would check how much was sent to an adress and how much was spent!
@_date: 2013-06-22 06:50:05
He is smart, but, he isn't very tech savvy in, like advanced stuff. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:44:05
If it had spent outputs yes

If you do get a cheap android device. Please don't think it's the standard android experience. My sister did that, bought one of those really small phones from sony. Couldn't do anything. Bought an iPhone. She's now constantly comparing a 180$ phone to a 930$ phone.
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:53:59
He is nerdy, just not economics nerdy... 
Bitcoin cannot fall unless something better comes along. So I'm guessing when and not if
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:52:49
It was stolen from me
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:20:28
PRAISE DUARTE
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:14:35
In the US even! WOW!
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:44:02
as stated in the post, I too found that a smartphone would be better...

Yup, I told him. Inflation proof, real world purposes, all that stuff

I pulled the donate to EFF with hats.
I even showed him that I bought the humble bundle with them. I can't emphasize how great that is

isn't that what happen with every single card today? they get your card information and your password... also the merchant is the one who writes the data... and it's only in - values so why couldn't he trust it?
