If you don't think in the real world that the ultimate point of money is money then I don't know what to tell you.
Philosophies and ideologies really all boil down to a person saying "I think this scenario is how I'm most likely to come out on top." Markets are selfish, everything comes down to people wanting more money. No one dives into a "financial revolution" thinking to themselves "I hope I come out of this as poor or poorer than I was going in!"

They aren't telling people what to do with their money, they're simply saying they won't facilitate Bitcoin purchases themselves. 
As an analogy, if someone asked for a burger at Chipotle they would reply "we don't serve burgers here." They aren't telling that person "you aren't allowed to buy burgers ever," just that it's something they don't personally offer. 
Likewise ML is simply telling people that Bitcoin isn't a product they support with their brokerage services, they don't care if one of their clients has Bitcoin holdings outside of their account with ML though.

If the US taxed it like a foreign currency most people would end up paying higher taxes on it given how they're using it(speculation). Brilliant. 
Foreign currency tax treatment is beneficial for people using a currency like a currency, but it's worse for speculators, as long term gains under it are taxed as ordinary income which is far higher than cap gains tax on normal assets.

TVs could do it nigh instantly with video broadcasts, not just still images. And that was a tech that had existed half a century by then. Transmitting an image around the world wasn't a novel technology in the 1990s. Remember people were watching streamed video from the moon in their homes back in 1969. A system that took minutes to load a single still image was not seen as fast by anyone.

It's odd to think crypto will be much of a haven in a first world financial crisis. People tend to empty accounts to stay floating in those times like happened in 2008. It's likely that would include crypto holdings as people are forced to dump them to pay bills, mortgages etc. And since crypto doesn't have a tax deferred advantage like say a 401k it'll likely be dumped before a lot of other investment vehicles for most.

Fractional reserve banking is different than central banking. We've been using fractional reserve banking since the 1400s even when our money was based on precious metals and there were no central bank. You can practice fractional banking even with a static commodity as your basis

It has to be accepted for *debts*, not purchases. You can stipulate "card only" as a condition of entering into a contract with a person, and simply not serve them if they don't have a card thus making them not indebted to you.

Yeah? Cash has zero consumer protections and is impractical to use relative to a card, I basically don't use it anymore. I took out $60 like 8 months ago and still have $40 in my wallet.

Debit cards are really the same idea.

And again, even on debit cards they will potentially limit purchases with vendors with a history of fraud, this is in your agreement with them.

Additionally when gamers can't buy GPUs they're not likely going to building new PCs and buy all the other parts and peripherals those retailers are trying to sell. Taking a loss on a GPU makes sense if it's the only way you can move all your other components out the door.

So Yahoo Japan is an independent company that the old Yahoo(now Altaba) owns stock of. Yahoo Japan pays for the right to license the Yahoo name.

Bitcoin has no goals. It's just a tool. What it accomplishes will have nothing to do with what its creator intentioned and everything to do with what people use it for.
For example, the microwave oven, one of the most impactful inventions of the 20th century, was borne out of radar development in WWII. The researchers had no intention of making such a thing, but the market had other ideas.

State and municipal governments don't want to overly dictate market competition with sales taxes. 
For example if Store A is in one municipality and competitor Store B across the street is in another municipality and those municipalities have different sales taxes then it may unduly hurt Store B if they are required to list items with tax included if Store B has to deal with higher taxes. 
It would make it seem like Store B is overcharging on everything and would send everyone to the other place when they may in fact be charging the same and Store B can't help the tax part. They don't want the tax difference to pose an obvious competitive disadvantage. By allowing stores to list price at POS it reduces the competitive impact of different taxes

When economic productivity outpaces how much is mined? Yes, it is. Coinage based on mined precious metals was workable when the mines and distribution could keep up with growing populations and growing efficiencies from technology.
 But the industrial revolution combined with massive population growth really changed the dynamic where the economy started growing faster than we could find the stuff and yank it out of the ground. That's why a few decades after said revolution people began transitioning away from commodity based standards, it became impractical to mine at rates equal to economic productivity jumps. 
Gold production has tripled since the 1930s. Human productivity on the other hand has exploded. For example one of the most highly skilled industrial jobs of the 30s was a tire builder making heavy truck tires. They could assemble a few dozen a day that would last 50,000 miles. In a modern factory a "tire builder" oversees 10 machines that can churn out hundreds of semi truck tires that will run for 300,000 miles. And similar advances happened across all industries. Gold never had a chance to keep up.

How does an exchange argue that bitcoin is "their" service. These protections only exist for services actually owned by someone. **No one owns the bitcoin code.**
"It hurts my business" isn't itself a legal argument. That's called competition. They only have a legal argument if they can say "it is unfairly infringing upon something I invented/own"

All currencies **ARE** assets. That is not a "one or the other" distinction.
Many federal agencies freely use the term "currency" to describe cryptos. 
I have a feeling you are getting confused by tax treatment. For the purposes of taxation Bitcoin is treated like standard property. It does not get **foreign** currency treatment because it is not a **foreign** state issued currency. The only type of currency US tax code grants a special tax allowance to is **foreign** currency. No other types of currency are called out in the IRC thus the rest all get standard treatment.
The fact that bitcoin doesn't qualify as a **foreign** currency doesn't mean the US doesn't recognize it as a form of currency. Every US agency that has issued guidance on cryptos has used the term "currency."

You are missing the point that lending **any** amount of reserves creates a fractional reserve. My example is absolutely fractional reserve


And they can use the exact same financial techniques to do the same thing with a crypto if that was the unit of account. 


In my country(United States) we've actually written reserve requirements for banks that dictate liquidity ratios that must be achieved. 
But again, this is all immaterial since in a hypothetical world based on a cryptocurrency there would be little to stop this practice so long as it's a fungible unit, which bitcoin is 
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:27:38
I literally explained to you how it's possible to have fractional reserves with bitcoin.
If I deposit 100 Bitcoins into a bank and they lend out 30 of it that's a fractional reserve. In that situation they would have a reserve of 70 which is a fraction of the 100 bitcoin liability I pose to them. 
It really doesn't appear you actually understand what fractional reserve banking is...
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:45:28

"What makes one the right one and the other the wrong one?" is a question you probably don't want a court to decide.
Again, there is no legal defining authority for bitcoin. The current version *you personally* think is the "real" one is actually several distinct forks removed from the actual original version. 
I don't think you appreciate that what you want to happen, which is regulatory authorities defining which version or fork "bitcoin" is, is opening up a giant can of worms where you now have given government legal power to influence future development. If they can dictate which version is afforded legal branding protections then good luck getting bitcoin exchanges/services to ever promote forking to anything away from that protected version. Congrats, you just either crippled it or handed government the reigns.

The money multiplier effect is an artifact of the reality that the overwhelming majority of loans are actually issued between institutions and never actually cashed out. So they can build up debt by swapping ledger values instead of cash.
For example Bank A customers may have $1 billion of outstanding loans owed to Bank B. Meanwhile Bank B customers have $1.1 billion of outstanding loans owed to Bank A. Between the 2 institutions there's $2.1 Billion of debt, but they're able to settle it with only $0.1 Billion since most of the debt actually cancels itself out. $2.1 billion of debt out of $0.1 billion of cash.
This can be done with any fungible asset. We used to do it with gold even though banks couldn't invent more gold at a whim.

Gold is a scientifically defined element. There are legally recognized standards bodies that have it defined all the way down to the atomic structure.
Bitcoin on the other hand doesn't have anything like that. There is no legally recognized crypto governing body and no law saying exactly which crypto chain is a bitcoin.
A better analogy is the "escalator." The people who slapped the name "escalator" on their specific brand of moving stairs ended up failing to protect the term and now literally any company can use it for their own version. 
Part of the issue of a "decentralized" network is there's really no one to trademark and protect the term for usage on only one crypto chain. Ver has no legal hurdles right now for obsfucating the term and gerericizing it forever.

I can cite the definitions of water and urine used by medical licensing boards that are deferred to by government in licensing MDs to prove the difference.
There is no body recognized by the government that can do the same thing as far as defining what fork "Bitcoin" applies to. It's a brand term, not a scientifically defined material. The current iteration you think "bitcoin" is is actually several forks removed from the original. 
Do you really want the US government defining which fork is and isn't afforded brand protections for the term bitcoin? Because if so you just handed the reigns of future development to them!!! YAY

Clearly there is given the fact that we've only been able to triple production in a century despite it remaining a highly sought commodity. Mining gold still comes down to finding very rare veins, buying all the land above them, and physically cutting down to it all. Gold has a number of physical properties and geologic issues that simply limit how much we can get practically. It's not like coal where there are literal mountains of the stuff or oil where you can stick one pipe in and slurp up miles of it. Veins are limited and difficult to get to.

This would require bitcoin to be legally defined as one single fork, or trademarked by a single authority. How do you go about doing that? 
Since "bitcoin" is a non-trademarked increasingly genericized term it's going to be hard to argue what Ver is doing is illegal. The same legal tenet that allows any company to slap the term "escalator" on their version of moving stairs also applies to bitcoin. Just because the term "escalator" started off only applying to one company's version of moving stairways doesn't mean they get to forever keep it they don't successfully maintain the trademark for it. Likewise without a trademark enforcing authority the mark "bitcoin" legally can be slapped onto anyone's version of crypto.

Person A deposits 100 Bitcoins with a bank trusting their security and insurance is more ideal than worrying about it themselves. 
The bank has analytics that suggest the average Person A will only ever dip into a small percent of their holdings at a time. So knowing that the bank takes a portion and loans 30 of it out to Person B. The bank bets that Person B will be able to pay back the loan with interest before Person A ever needs to be paid out 100 bitcoins all at once.  
And when Person A looks at their bank account the bank will still report their account is valued at 100 bitcoins even though the bank took part of the pile and lent it out. 
That's the highly simplified version of fractional reserve banking. You can swap out the word "bitcoin" with dollars, yen, gold, Stanley Nickels, shriveled monkey heads etc etc and it still works. The unit of account really isn't critical **as long as it's fungible.**
