The government represents the voters. If you do not vote at every phase that you possibly can, you are not being represented by the government.
Do I think the government represents the voting public? Yes.
Do I think the government represents america as a whole? Probably not. However, we must ask. Who's fault is that? The government? Lobbyist? Corperations? 
Not really. They can maybe skew ads against us, but in the end, if we push hard enough, the government responds.

Lol, Lobbying also has nothing to do with this either.
This government wants this bill pushed through. The government can't lobby itself. I can't think of a single business entity that would be for a bill preventing encryption, unless the government was putting internal pressure on the company. The overwhelming opinion of the public is to keep our privacy. A company, who relies on public image, would never do something so self-destructive. 
Hell, if anything, companies that need a good public image would probably lobby **against** this, in order to look good in the future with the public, which ultimately, the shareholders are responsible to. Nobody invests in a company that the public doesn't buy things from.

The question is, what part of the government actually gains power from this? The CIA or FBI? Maybe. Ultimately however, what do congress members gain from this? Nothing. If the public were actually against this the same way reddit was, we'd already be introducing legislation to prevent further attempts at banning encyption.
There's a reason an entire half of our founding fathers wouldn't agree to anything without a bill of rights. It pre-emptively stops bills like this for passing. We need to vote in legislation. If we keep stopping these things, eventually something will slip though our fingers. 
Free encryption.

If all fiat failed at once, it would be every society enduring a complete economic meltdown at the same time. That to me, is more melodramatic. 


You'd be holding gold if you were hedging against the dollar. Holding gold to hedge against all of fiat currency (Every country in the world is fiat now, except for 2 obscure nations with low trade power) is absurd, because you can't hedge against the entire economy at once. Frequently, other nations currency' (especially ones on float in the forex) will run parallel to gold reserves, in comparison to the US, which tends to run inversely to gold reserves. 
You literally can't hedge all fiat, because some fiat currency runs inversely correlated to other fiat currency. Can you make a play using bitcoin to hedge against the dollar? For sure, I agree with that. You can't on the other hand, hedge against all currency every where, with any commodity.

The diverse knowledge on the sub is part of what makes it great.
I know almost nothing about programming or crypto, but I'm in finance. I've learned so much from these comments and debates. At first it was hard to tell the good information from the bad, but in the end, it just makes it more rewarding every time something clicks.

Huh? Real money has no risk? That's completely absurd. A huge part of our financial system runs purely *because* money has risk. 
Literally, US government bonds. Every time you buy one, you are essentially paying back the government's institutional debt. You are taking on the risk of losing your initial investment, in order to make 3-5%. The odds of you losing your money in bonds is low, which is why the Rate of return is also low. If the government and it's currency had 0 risk, you couldn't make a return by holding it. 


Why does this blog assume interest rates will continue to decrease? That's not the way the Fed works. A firm would instantly forgo the safety of a US deposit if the delta between returns was 13% sans inflation (assuming a stock investment for a big cap can hit 10% average a year ROE). In turn, the interest rate would rise, in order to slow the unsustainable growth we would experience from companies investing their short term assets into different vehicles. 


Why is this a meltdown in the making? An export based economy relies on the price of it's goods being cheap. Devaluing your currency is helping this goal, not hurting it. If you argument was that China is trying to shift towards an import based economy, you could maybe defend it, but you can't defend devaluation as a negative in an export economy, because it by definition, isn't. 


Quantitative easing is NOT printing money. Holy shit, that's bad. [Here's an article on balance sheets, and what QE actually does to a firm](

What? Hayak would never agree with anything you're saying.
Bitcoin has a hard limit, and is infinitely divisible. Due to this, it acts exactly the opposite of a federally backed currency. Deflation to bitcoin does exactly what inflation does to the US dollar. 
Your mistake is comparing bitcoin to the US dollar. Bitcoin doesn't behave like a currency, at least not economically. It behaves like a commodity.

Perfect analogy.

This article doesn't even mention what kind of money laundering bitcoin is good or bad for.

If you are trying to get your legally earned money laundered from the government to prevent paying taxes on it, bitcoin won't really help you.

The government can track the amount you are being paid through your employer, so even if you can fake your personal income, it will be immediately obvious when other sources claim you should have more money than you say you do, and no amount of hiding it will do you any good.
You must create a paper trail saying you officially lost the money. through "bad" investments. You will still pay income tax, but that's nothing compared to payroll and capital gains. Ever wonder why CEO's frequently have $1 salaries? Here you go.
Now the other thing. Say a friend of a friend (let's call him X) really had some crazy cash he needed to keep hidden. I begin accepting bitcoin transactions at my magic club. I pay for some of the shittiest champagne you can possibly buy, $4 a bottle type shit. We charge $1000 a bottle, and we pay some chick $20 an hour to serve it. 
X pays his buddies to come in and buy bottles all night with his own money. All they have to do is have a crazy good time, pick up the nice ladies with all their money, and not tell a soul it actually doesn't belong to them. 
ever see random guys spending more on a bottle than on their entire wardrobe for that night? Friends.
Now we have taxable income created at a club we are renting from people we "don't know.' I don't why all these drug dealers keep hanging out in my club sir, but I promise it's only because we're swanky.
Also, there is the added benefit of people who genuinely acquired their currency trying to keep up with the laundered money(pride and all that), causing you to actually have 996$ profit margins on LEGITIMATE transactions. Nice people, those guys.

I personally don't think you need a degree to display knowledge and skill, but a bank, the only place he could acquire such information in a reasonable time period, generally requires a degree for employment.
Obviously we can't rule anything out, but I think the chances are better than not that he has some sort of STEM degree to facilitate working around general ledgers. And not just data entry bullshit, I mean really being responsible and seeing their inner-workings.

We are ignoring one of the strongest indicators for who Nakamoto is. 
It's not his coding that was brilliant. His coding was good, but not great. Hell, the idea that led to the creation of the block chain was already around in the form of torrents. 
What he had, that other similarly skilled programmers didn't, was an absolutely obscene amount of knowledge regarding banking and finance, as well as the way general ledgers work. 
These disciplines very rarely cross paths. Even great algo-traders don't typically have banking knowledge. 
There's very little doubt in my mind that Satoshi must be at least 2 people. someone with knowledge of programming and cryptology, and someone with both knowledge and experience in high finance. 
Does Craig really fit either of these descriptions?

Hedging against Fiat? Not all currencies react the same way in every circumstance, hedging against all fiat is like hedging against society.

just the possibility that a million coins could be sold so quickly would automatically cause bearish investors to either short or sell their long positions.

According to who, or what? You'll have a very hard time finding literature to support this. In fact, the opposite is true. [Getting off the gold standard was the catalyst that began recovery from the great depression, (Which actually happened in 1933, not 1979)](
[What you are mentioning from 1979 is the treasury failing to pay T-Bills due to an inefficient system, and then not wanted to repay the interest accrued over the 14 days they literally forgot to pay back.](


So has every other country in the world. There is exactly one country still on gold backed currency, and they are currently facing insolvency. It has nothing to with sovereign debt.

It doesn't make sense because a monopoly is not the same as monopolistic power. 
A firm has a tendency to exhibit monopolistic behavior when they capture at least 25% market share. It doesn't really make sense to make business decisions in response to the market, if you are a small cap. Your business decisions will instead be in response to your closest competitors. 
The question is, in a market that has no way of preventing other competition through unnatural means, is having a monopolistic share really that bad? I think the answer is no.

You can't inflate away debt, it doesn't work that way. 
Inflation is a function of economic growth, but it can grow regardless of GDP increasing or decreasing. 
[An aggregate shift in demand will cause both GDP and inflation to rise](
[An aggregate shift in supply will cause GDP to fall, but inflation to rise](


This isn't a surprise or problem, it's exactly what you would expect from inflation.

Please actually read my links, if you don't read, you won't learn. 
[Our dollar was no longer exchangeable for gold as of 1971. This is not the same as the value of our currency being tied to gold.]( Again, read the above links. They are important, and if you don't understand the difference, you will be laughed out of any room where people actually know what they are talking about.


Again, read the sources I posted. the fed rate was fluctuating rapidly after 1933, not 1971. Because the dollar value was no longer tied to gold, we could encourage spending like we couldn't before. This action brought us out of the worst depression in US history.


You need a source to make dubious claims like these. Just because you think gold is sound money practice, doesn't mean it actually is. 




Non of these metrics support your argument. Also, why did you use 1980? That's pretty random considering it has nothing to do with any of your prior points. [Unemployment was at 25%!]( during the great depression of 1929 (When we were still on the gold standard) was the highest it's ever been for our country. Since our currency stopped being backed by gold in 1933, Our unemployment has never been even half of that.


Good job, you understand economics. Boom and bust cycles are in every economy, ever. So in 1980 we shrank, in 1990, we grew, from 2004-2008, we shrank, and from then to now we've grown. Basic economics 101. Unfortunately, that has absolutely nothing to do with gold. 
 &gt;rapid expansion of the monetary base in an effort to prevent total collapse or hyperinflation.
No, that's not what that means. The fed rate doesn't change the total supply of money, it didn't on gold, and it certainly doesn't now. The fed changes the % of money that is available to debtors.


Source. It seems like you don't know what a centrally planned economy actually is. 


Interest rates have been a free market fundamental since the east India trading company. Right after mercantilism ran it's course. 
Also, QE is literally the government buying securities. Do you except the free market to not react to a giant entity buying millions of shares of almost everything? That's not what free market means.
