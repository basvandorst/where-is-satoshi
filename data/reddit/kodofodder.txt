I expect half of the ASIC preorder companies to ship. Likelyhood of shipping and on time listed below in order. I believe we will see a massive run-up of the difficulty. The first device up and hashing will ROI, likelihood of every device after that drops of perciptiously. You better be in the top 10% for these preorders.

And I'm not buying these products for bitcoin because I value my coin more then my fiat in future purchasing power
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:08:10
Well I do hope for everyone's sake you can get most of these coins back..... I've pretty much given up hope at this point, and can't afford a lawyer because....money. Anxiously awaiting more news.
Also if they do pull through with this "gox" rebrand I feel they may just throw out all the bitcoinbuilder coins based on some ToS violation or some other BS. Easy money is never easy. An expensive lesson learned this week.
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:35:11
Well technically based on his prices there really isn't even a deal here. Normalish prices for all these vapes. Source I own most of them.

I bet Ver knew about the malleability leak, as well as Karpeles. Infact I believe it was a planned backdoor exit strategy. Its all been siphoned to thousands of 5 bitcoin accounts that Ver and the fat fuck will live off for years. Claiming oo it was stolen......I like story time. Whose next?

These folks are planting roughly 500 litecoin worth of trees in Madagascar. A donation project set up by r/litecoin because we feel bad about all the juice we use to mine.

I heard he was the CEO of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:54:33
I actually hold him in more contempt as he knowingly fleeced a fledgling technology and torpedo this fresh adventure that is bitcoin, more than once. This guy hoped to get away with it because it was unregulated and he thought he was some magical fux who could make it all disappear.

I was not referring to any dev in particular. To whom  specifically do you refer?
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:27:15
For rooms and food only, not table games or slots. And the Local BTM is usually not taking coin, only selling. May have changed recently, but as of 6 months ago. No. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:57:02
Sorry for your experience, but they did offer you a refund. However what it sounds like you want to complain about is their customer service. They did not process your order in a timely fashion, and took no steps to alleviate the issue they put you in by not shipping on time.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:33:12
SO lets get some more numbers on purse.io purchase's and growth. Just adds more fuel to the fire, retail can and does work as a BTC use case.

It is some what true though. I will concede we would be losing talent, and more importantly historic tribal knowledge of these individuals. On the flip side, one dev does not make a team, any single code contributor can be replaced. The core issue here is the solution is not being discussed properly. Censorship et al. BitcoinXT  I view as a forcing maneuver. It may not be the best option, but it will force discussion and hopefully bring a better solution to the forefront.
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:13:27

Cant tell if sarcasm or serious......
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:30:24
Well that's a bit disingenuous. They give you a refund in the form of store credit. I see no issue here, you get a faulty product ask for a new one, you dont like the new one, get something else.  
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:08:59
Correct, larger market cap, more liquidity.
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:15:57
I think he meant in Bitcoins, only 21 million avali, less if you get rid of those lost forever.

It is a cryptocurrency backed by bitfinex, there have recently been some concerns around it regarding solvency, and they are currently undergoing an investigation by cftc I believe, but by and large the market has decided they are solvent. Tether was developed as a hedge against the volatility of Bitcoin, allowing the user to continue to hold crypto assets, without being exposed to high volatility. It kind of allows you to enter and exit crypto positions without actually cashing to Fiat. There may be other uses, but those are how I have viewed the product.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:12:44
I don't think it will ever stabilize in the standard sense of a currency, because it is different from currency in that no more can ever be printed(well very unlikely, code changes plus agreement of basically everyone invested) it was designed to be anti inflationary, so it just doesn't behave like normal money, tether on the other hand, that is a lot like the dollar....because it is pegged to the USD on a 1:1 ratio
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:17:42
I went to the D just about a month ago to cash out .5 bitcoin and do some gambling, but the ATM was not buying. So my experience is less wow, and more meh. My girlfriend was also not impressed.
