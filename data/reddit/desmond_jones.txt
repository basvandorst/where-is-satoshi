I'm confused. How do these forks get created if they are "scammy?"
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:15:04
Yank out the *principal* with no fees or penalties. Any profit is different. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:24:39
Wow. I had no idea about that. 
I guess my next question is why is that a thing? Like what is the purpose?

He eats McDonald's everyday for breakfast. The documentary didn't go over any other meals.
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:21:32
How long does it take to get verified? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:40:44
Howd you end up broke in the first place?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:16:41
"We are verifying your identity and will be in touch shortly. Gemini is currently experiencing extremely high application volume and there may be delays as the compliance team completes the review of your application."
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:34:15
What is your salary though?
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:43:46
Isn't that what I said?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:31:25
Wow. I'm not claiming to work there. 
Thats the message you get when you try to verify an account. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:06:05
Yeah I agree, I guess.

I use xn--eectrum-9hb to hold all my coins!
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:15:21
What would prevent me or anyone from sending some bitcoin to this address?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:16:24
Yeah. I love Gemini. 
Hope to use it sometime this year.

He combined a government cipher SHA256 and a public/academic cipher RIPEMD160. That way if you don't trust the NSA you still have a public cipher and if you don't trust the public cipher you have the government cipher.
Here is the real genius:
Suppose RIPEMD160 was broken. Suppose you can instantly reverse an address to it's SHA256 hash.
Great. But you still need to reverse the SHA256 hash into a public key. There will be on average 296 public keys that hash into the address. So you still need to do a brute force search through 2160 keys to find a private key!
Now suppose both RIPEMD160 and SHA256 are broken. You can reverse an address into it's public key. That's great but you still cannot recover the private key without solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem. Or you can brute force private keys but that is 2160 work!
Birthday Paradox collision attacks are also futile from an attacker's perspective.
He also chose the secp256k1 curve which is NOT a NSA curve. In fact there are no magic numbers in this curve which means it's very very VERY unlikely to be backdoored.
This leads me to believe Satoshi is somebody from the cryptography community. You need to be a real expert to come up with such a secure scheme.
Also I know ECC is not quantum resistant but the address scheme is still secure when addresses are only spent from once. Even today nobody builds quantum resistant systems so we shouldn't expect Satoshi to 9 years ago.

It's not that hard to understand. Basically he's saying a lot of so-called "experts" like to criticize Bitcoin's design, in particular the way addresses are hashed from public keys.
The truth is Satoshi was a genius when it came to cryptography.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:02:16
Did he glue real bitcoins to the painting??
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:27
How long have you been waiting for verification? 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:38:30
Is it a sat or a satoshi?
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:18:57
    Needs more Jpeg
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:45:41
Oh Dogecoin?
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:14:32
Explain like I'm new to bitcoin please.
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:46:33


your honor.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:23:42
how do invest??
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:36:37
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:42:22
That was me December 2017.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:25:43
Which was better?
@_date: 2019-06-21 20:12:08
But then it goes up 3x!

50 UPVOTES = BROKE THRU 5,000
SMASH THAT UPVOTE BUTTON GUYS
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:21:06
Can you make it go past the current price?
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:57:52
ricegum lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:26:19
Don't let go of your dogecoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:51:25
Bank of America is your friend. Wait...
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:16:15
Wait for the 11 year challenge. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:20:37
Yeah bitcoin will be obsolete in about 12 months and Garlicoin will take over. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:30:36
Sucks for whoever paid when it moons in 24 hours
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:13:19
HOW DO I SHORT???? /s
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:47:39
BUY THE DIPPPPPPPPPPPPP
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:36:16
uhhh what did I miss with eth?
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:45:58
Story doesn't say they got the 3000. If the story is real.
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:46:30
Well *I* only check my wallets via tor being run on a burner laptop I destroy afterwards. My .0004382 bitcoins are safe.
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:31:06
Hey its me your bitcoin guy. Please resend me your private keys.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:48:11
dude it LOST 500 POINTS!!!!!

I love cryptocurrency subreddits.
