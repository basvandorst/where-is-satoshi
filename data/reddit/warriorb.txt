Not much of a trader here. Just registered to buy some ETC. I left it one day and I ended losing 1500 usd (I had 10k there). After losing with ETH, ETC and LTC, I'm done trading shitcoins and will hodl only BTC.

Wow now I think I know where you're from ;)
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:13:59
Would like to see the transaction

Or what Netflix did to Blockbuster? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This is a very cool business model and I really liked their monetization channels. However I believe that for something like this to generate interesting returns as a content publisher Bitcoin has to have a significantly higher level of adoption. 
Also the prices they put as an example could work for the US or European countries, but I consider them rather high for less developed countries.

In my opinion the ATH is $1250. I know it's not the "real" ATH since it was in Mt GOX but just to see BTC higher than that would be my milestone. 
Hope to see that soon :)

And when will this be available? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:41:26
I see this upward pressure for at least 3/4 months. Source: my imagination (or not?)

Got the same mail. Btc is the only payment I use to hire freelancers. I will no longer use them 
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:07:52
Best representation ever 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:20:44
Ahh the drama. Much needed in Bitcoin community when price is growing 
@_date: 2017-01-28 15:45:55
Yes I'm checking that one from my Netscape browser 
@_date: 2016-11-13 21:41:29
This did not reflect the BTC price the last couple of days. Even Trump´s election generated a larger buzz
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:54:04
Yes this is true. However not all the freelancers I work with accept bitcoin. Believe me I have tried to convince everyone, but some feel "safer" with fiat

@_date: 2016-11-13 21:40:24
I actually recall this very well, 20 GB
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:02:09
Hey good luck on your new venture. It sounds very interesting and the bitcoin community definitely is in need of new companies that provide a good service. 
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:35:20
So many things happening in the bitcoin space. Glad to see your recap. Please continue doing this every month I really enjoy it. Here is my upvote ;)

same here, just bought some very "expensive" air tickets at a special "discount" ;)

I’m a citizen of this earth and Bitcoin user. I agree with this message 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:02:21
Totally agree. I’ve had so many issues with banks, specially this year 
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:41:46
If you’ve been in crypto for some time, when something like this or even worse things happens with banks you really know eventually this will happen.

This gave me a huge laugh :D
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:48:57
Is there any way to back up GA? I had this issue every time I change my phone 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:26:21
Is this good news? Or is it another potential conflict? Serious question 
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:06:15
Holy shit if this is actually you I own a fraction of your ex stash 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:47:21
I can't upvote this more. Every newcomer should know this! 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:35:35
When I read the original medium article these 2 questions came into my mind. I honestly can't believe all these companies are willing to such compromise without the consensus of the whole community. 
IDK, I'll just be sailing this ship seeing what happens 
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:50:30
I know the people from  and they have considered this. Besides this development is almost already done. Their main issue is that the btc or crypto users are still very small. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 10:18:15
The next few days are going to be a roller coaster (both ways). 
Long term, I'm still bullish

Would love to have an AMA with one of these TSA agents in this sub

@_date: 2016-07-09 15:57:05
It's happening, it's happening, the "halvening" ahhhh
@_date: 2016-07-11 14:56:20
What is necessary for Bitcoin to become mainstream? And how much time do you think that will take? 
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:22:54
Please explain for a non technical person why increasing the block size limit is not a good enough solution for scaling Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:53:24
I've been using them for over a year and it has been working fine. Actually taking a trip this summer with the family to the beach paid 100% with BTC
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:06:55
