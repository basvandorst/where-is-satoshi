To talk about the miner, this (embedding miner in a website for site revenue) has been done before, and this is even much less practical now (ASIC miners did not exist then).
20kh/s/user = 20Gh/s/million users. What this means is that if your website has an average of 1 million simultaneous visitors (hint: it doesn't), you will get around $2.50 per day at current difficulty and exchange rate.

Fees are necessary to prevent spamming. Without fees, one person can generate thousands of transactions per second.
Fixed reward for mining decreases over time and therefore will rely more and more on transaction fees.
The Bitcoin Core (formerly Bitcoin Qt) developers decide on it. You can actually set the fee to anything. The amount of fees will determine the likelihood the transaction will be included in the next mined block. The decision to lower the fees mean that the miners will include lower fee transactions to the block by default.

The way Bitcoin works is you hold a secret key to access your bitcoins instead of holding bitcoins themselves. Normally, this secret key is stored in your computer and your wallet program uses it automatically. Instead of doing this, you can just print your secret key on a paper. This is called a paper wallet.

Since there are people who are getting downvoted (including OP) because they are not understanding, I will try my best to explain differently.
Let's say two people are betting against each other infinitely in a fair game. Since there is randomness involved, no matter what the expected value is (which would be 100% for both in this case), your capital will sway up and down depending on your luck.
Because you are playing infinitely, it is [almost sure]( that there will be a point in time where you will lose all the money you have, due to an unlucky losing streak. It is almost sure because the timeframe is infinite. When you lose all your money at one point, you cannot play anymore; therefore, you are broke. The other person now has all the money.
The problem here is that house basically sets the rules in a way that it effectively has infinite capital. The best the gambler can do is match that. However, it is obviously much more likely that the gambler has far less capital than the house. This means that the gambler is, if he were to bet eternally, going to go broke at some point.

All new addresses are generated by first generating a random and long private key and then using a set of computations to get a public key from it. Your client basically stores all the private/public key pairs and keeps track of them on block chain in order to know how much bitcoins you have.
The wallet.dat data file actually stores 100 extra keys so that you don't need to back up your wallet every time you generate a new address or send a payment. So when you generate a new address, it pulls a pre-generated one from wallet.dat and refill it to still have 100 extra addresses.

Do keep in mind that by using this service, you lose control of your money.

Wallet stores private keys and addresses with no information whatsoever about bitcoins. Blockchain stores transactions. Bitcoin clients use blockchain to figure out how much bitcoin exists in each address in wallet.
So you can make as many copies as you want, and any future transactions are irrelevant to the wallet.dat as it doesn't contain information about bitcoins anyways.
Do keep in mind that Bitcoin client dynamically generates new addresses when sending bitcoins. You need to back up at least every 100 sends.

Something like Paypal can do exactly the same thing Inputs.io does, and it has shown it is very stable, processing huge volumes of money every day.
By the way, I am still very surprised how quickly things changed on r/Bitcoin. People were very cautious about trusting any third party, telling people not to use exchanges as wallets, not to leave Bitcoin on mining pools, and emphasizing the power of Bitcoin to be trustless not a long time ago. "Be your own bank," a popular phrase on r/Bitcoin, was thought as one of the biggest benefit of using Bitcoins, but I guess things change.
I think the best role for Inputs.io would be to be like a physical wallet. You normally carry small amounts of money in your wallet but keep the most safe in banks. Likewise, Inputs.io wallet should have a small amount of Bitcoins to be used conveniently while keeping the most safely on your own.

Public keys are basically generated from a one way hashing. You can think of it as if a random key of selected from a pool of all possible keys is assigned to each private key. Theoretically, each public key has an infinite number of private keys that can be used. However, the second shortest private key might be 10 million characters or 99 billion characters long long, meaning you basically can't find another private key from a public key.

GUIMiner is just a front-end. It can run many different miners in the back-end. You probably used POCLBM when you used GUIMiner, which is a very good miner.
I find CGMiner to be the best one around--fastest (although it can depend on some factors) and richest in features. If you like GUIminer, you can run CGMiner in it too.

There is no such thing as sent from address in Bitcoin trasaction. Well, there kind of is but it's not exactly how you would imagine. You don't really get to choose which address your bitcoins will be sent from.
Reading this article might clear things a bit for you.
By the way, your client did not say you received transactions from that guy. You just have that specific address Satoshi Dice sent bitcoins to labeled that way.

Yes, it's normal. It doesn't happen a lot, but there is nothing out of the ordinary. Look at the pool luck. It's been unlucky in both 1-day and 7-day period, but it has been lucky in 30-day period. (105% in 30-day period is actually very high because variance decreases as time increases.)

1. You are misunderstood in how bitcoins are stored. Blocks simply record transactions. What you have in your wallet is, basically, what is left in your wallet after all transactions were calculated. For example if 3 transactions regarding a bitcoin address has happened, 50btc mining in, 25btc spent, and 5 received, only these three transactions are stored in the block chain. The client knows it has 30btc because 50-25+5=30. Wallets do not actually send and receive coins--they read transactions from block chain and generate new transactions.
2. It is probably because you are using a client that forces some transaction fee. Standard transaction fee is somewhere between 0.0005 and 0.01 (unless it is a huge transaction in terms of byte size), so the math checks out. These transaction fees go to the miners who mine the blocks and validate the transactions.
3. I do not really understand your question, but the number of bitcoins generated is a fixed number. It does not matter there is high demand or not.
4. A "satoshi" is 0.00000001btc. So unless it goes to the point even one satoshi is too big of a unit (which isn't going to happen in a forseeable future) it is not a problem. Also, even if it does happen, developers can change the protocol midway through to allow more decimal points.

It doesn't look like a competitor at all. Ripple simply works with existing currencies and make it easier to send and receive. Bitcoins can be sent and received on Ripple too. Ripple itself isn't really meant to be a currency.

This was not even a month ago from Josh. They shouldn't be so confident if they couldn't meet their original goal not by days nor weeks but by months multiple times.

Even if you can mine at no extra cost at all (such as electricity, internet, and hardware), the effort you are putting in is not worth the bitcoins you will be making with your CPU.
Regardless, you probably do not have whatever miner you are trying to use. GUIMiner is just a front end. You need to provide back-end yourself (although it does come with POCLBM by default).

High variance, not great for ASIC, full client required (unless you trust some other person's pool which makes it more like centralized pool), lacking detailed user-specific statistics and features, such as email notifications and per worker management.
So no, it has many disadvantages among advantages, and there are reasons to use other pools, just like there are reasons to use P2Pool.

Not true at all. You need an IP address for connection, and that cannot be spoofed. The only way to truly hide IP address is to use things like proxy or VPN to route the internet through a different network. While you should not rely on IP address for security purposes, there is absolutely no reason for MtGox to get IP address from the header rather than the actual connection.
@_date: 2013-02-23 21:07:04
You are describing a proportional pool. There are not that many big pools that work exactly like that due to pool hopping, and proportional doesn't work well if it is not big (very high variance).
Score based works in a very similar way but tries to solve pool hopping. It's not 100% hop resistant, but it does work well enough. Slush's pool is, afaik, the largest of them.
All other systems like PPS and PPLNS work differently--they don't pay you when a block is discovered but per share you submitted.

They are not capable of handling large volumes at all and has some issues, but they are perfectly willing to fix any problems. So while not everything may not go smoothly, you probably won't lose anything using it. It does usually cost you more than using a real exchange (due to higher fee and spread), so that's something to think about.

Like the support said, the address did NOT expire. You have misunderstood the problem despite the support trying to explain it to you many times. It was a shared address from the beginning. The "FROM" address of CampBX was never tied to your account.
A huge problem, however, is that their support seems extremely slow. And I do think CBX should return the funds to you. It will be pretty obvious the money came from you (sign a message that verifies you as the owner of 3BTC) with some simple investigations, and they can charge like a small fee. ($120/hr is ridiculous).

There is 0.0005 transaction fee.
Price multiplier with less than 64000 is 1.004x so you lose money even if you win if you are betting such a small amount. Pick something with higher multiplier or bet more bitcoins.

The good thing about Blockchain.info wallet (in contrast to other web wallets like Coinbase or Inputs.io) is that you actually own the private keys for your wallet.

You can sign any message using an address you own. They are signed with a private key but can be verified by public key. So I was thinking maybe you could sign "[your CBX name] is the owner of this address that sent 3 BTC". Since you deleted the app (and probably the private key), you cannot do this anymore.
It's too bad that CBX isn't willing to help you. While they have no obligation to honor this type of error made by the user, it really is a fixable problem with human intervention.

I haven't used Mt. Red, but being a PPS only mining pool for BTC, your description of either score based or proportional mining pool does not make sense.

Bitcoin is money, so you don't really "buy" bitcoins. It is hard to use credit card to buy bitcoins for the same reason it is hard to get hard cash from credit card. Sure, you can do it, but you will be restricted in amount and fees will be involved.
I don't really understand why you are so mad about it because while it really would be better if there were easier ways to get bitcoins, it's not like people are making it hard for you on purpose. Just calm down and wait for the bitcoin community to grow. There is no reason to be mad. No one is stealing your money.
