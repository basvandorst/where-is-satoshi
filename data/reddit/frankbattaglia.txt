Hire an accountant because it seems you don't understand how capital gains taxes work.

All it takes is the taxing entity recognizing it as a currency (e.g., Japan).  But as of right now in the US, yeah it doesn't really work.

Would you rather have 100 BCH or 100 BTC?  QED; they are not exactly the same thing.

Sure, but that's *also* not really using those instruments as a "currency".  Contrast with: (1) exchange USD to Euros, then (2) buy a car with those Euros.  If the EUR/USD moved between (1) and (2), you are not taxed on those "gains".  Currently this is impossible with Bitcoin, as step (2) is legally treated as "sell your Bitcoin for USD (capital gain) then buy a car with USD", regardless of how the transaction is actually executed.

You are somewhat correct, although the personal transaction exception to sec. 998 is based on the size of the *gain* (must be less than $200 USD) rather than the size of the transaction.  Which is to say, one could buy a $20,000 USD car without having to report / pay gains if the EUR/USD moved by less than 1% between (1) and (2).

Tax avoidance (i.e., structuring your finances to minimize the tax you owe) is legal.   Tax evasion (i.e., transacting in ways that hide the transaction from the IRS) is not legal.

If we’re talking “bank account” bank accounts, the only reason for a wealthy person to have money there and not invested is deposit insurance (e.g. FDIC in the US), thus each account will only hold up to that amount.  Yes, that means if a billionaire has $10 million in deposit accounts, they might have 40 “accounts” with $250,000 each.  There’s no reason to not structure their accounts that way, and they will be paying an accountant to take care of those details.

Wasn't the the initial idea of Bitcoin?  Micropayments without an expensive mediated transaction fee?  Seems things got a bit off track...

What you describe is a "tax event": You sell BTC e.g., for $13,000, with a cost basis of same $13,000.  Required to report and include on your Schedule D, but zero realized gain so zero tax due.  You then are buying the altcoin for $13,000, which will be the basis when you sell the altcoin.  The fact that you traded BTC for ALT directly with no fiat step inbetween means it **might** be a like kind transfer, which still requires reporting but would delay the tax due (in this case zero so it's kind of moot).

Opinions differ.  The "level one" answer is that any transfer of ownership is a "tax event" for which you must report, calculate, and pay capital gains taxes.  The "level two" answer if that coin-coin transfers may qualify as "like kind" transfers, which require reporting, but delay capital gains taxes.

Sure, as you say that’s how most exchanges currently work as far as we know.  But that’s not really at all equivalent to fractional reserve lending, where the “created” money leaves the bank and enters the external economy.  E.g., yesterday there was $1 in circulation, today there is $10.  
With a misbehaving exchange, the number of bitcoin in circulation never changes; it’s just not where everybody thinks it is.  What you describe (spending money supposedly held in trust for customers) is more like embezzlement / breach of fiduciary duty.

As I understand it, any fractional reserve lending would need to be off the blockchain, as the blockchain does not support creating new coin without mining / proof of work.  So while I could write out a bunch of IOUs backed by my bitcoin, I could not give out more *bitcoin* than I have.

"more or less"
Almost every sitcom has "developments"  E.g., Lucy and Ricky had Little Ricky and moved to LA.  It's part of the formula.

Individual stocks are high risk.  Baskets of stocks (when chosen appropriately) are low risk.

They would also not have anybody willing to accept the IOUs.  With fiat currency / fractional reserve, I don’t know whether the dollar you are giving me is “real” (i.e., originally issued as sovereign debt) or a fractional IOU.  They are completely fungible.  Thus people accept either.  But if every dollar was tagged as “real” or “not real,” how many merchants would accept “not real”?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:57:53
Again: why would any merchant accept the IOU instead of requiring  bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:16:48


I feel like that’s the *least likey* long term outcome.  As far as I can tell it’s only “a store of value” right now due to speculation / belief that it will eventually be in demand as a day to day currency.  If it ever becomes clear that it won’t work as a currency (or that some alt coin will win that space), why would anybody care who owns which bitcoin?

Not by any reasonable definition of “high risk,” no, and not compared  to many other available options.  That article you cite merely indicates that the market is not “safe,” i.e., there is *some* non-zero finite risk, regardless of time horizon.  No shit.  There is some non-zero risk of the Yellowstone Caldera going off and obliterating most of North America.  But that small (but non-zero) risk does not impact my investment decisions.  
The risk of the entire market *losing* significant, real value in the long term, while finite, is quite low.  As compared to e.g. bonds or CDs (theoretically very “safe”), I would say the chance of double digit inflation in the future eating away at fixed rate returns is significantly higher than the chance of the 2037 S&amp;P (inflation adjusted) being under 2,500.
