Bitcoin's minimal transaction fees are great for micro payments (my startup is planning on integrating bitcoin payment soon), but I feel like the average bitcoin user (young tech-savvy males) won't have much interest in pay to win games. That idea might have to wait until bitcoin has become more mainstream.

I'm not a developer, but I don't think our app has any permissions that would allow it to do that. I understand your concern though, is there anything you think we should do to make tTap seem more trustworthy?

Haha, thanks for checking us out. Best of luck to you too.

Wow, I didn't even realize it was my cake day! Thanks!
I admit that this is a shameless promotion for our app, but we're actually really interested in bitcoins. We just want to gauge interest in bitcoin payouts before implementing it.

Unless I'm mistaken, Locket only rewards $0.01 the first time you see a new ad, then it doesn't reward anything.
With tTap you earn 10 points/unlock, limit 3x an hour. We have a tiered reward system: 1500 pts = $1, 20000pts = $20, 48000pts = $50. If you save up to the highest tier you get paid 11% more for each unlock, compared to Locket.

Unfortunately bitcoin isn't that widespread yet. You and I may use bitcoins, but your next door neighbor would probably prefer the PayPal option.

I've been playing this for the last hour and a half instead of watching the bitstamp graphs. What have you done...

If you have PIN or pattern lock enabled, tTap will show up before the PIN. So you'll have to unlock your phone twice, but at least you're getting paid for it.
