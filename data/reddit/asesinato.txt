The internet will surely still exist, even with EMP and nukes.

Because it won't be the Fallout 4 scenario you imagine. There will still be countries and laws and the internet and bottle caps will not be the currency.

Why the hell would you put this in the Hilltop....? Just asking for a crackhead to rob you.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:12:13
This is worrisome.

Just use the "Found a new one". All it does is include the full zip and format it the way a post office would.

Countries don't turn into forced labor camps when they go to war...

That's because it's a satire website.

Why is everyone saying partner instead of gf...?
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:37:11
Watched. Decent analysis. Thanks for the input.

Nodes are vital to Bitcoin. Why would you shame someone trying to set one up?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:20:51
Hahaha, I saw this as well.

Orcas are not whales.

Cool pins! Pick me!

I would be weary of keeping any kind of significant amount of crypto on a phone. Maybe a hundred dollars or so to use as cash, but cold storage is the only way to go.

Lambo is the unofficial BitCoin moon vehicle.

He traded it for shitcoins, obviously, lol.

One needs to analyze positive and negative aspects of anything to make a correct assessment. I lurk. Quit being a retard.

I don't use reddit a lot... What is the point of karma farming?
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:19:53
Probably shouldn't give someone your private key for a purchase...
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:43:57
Not here.

Stop being concerned about the price. Start being concerned about how we can help push adoption.

Not trying to FUD, I'm genuinely interested in what you guys think of this article.

He touches his face so much during this interview...
That's a sign of deception, or at least that he's not quite sure about what he's saying. 
That said, I'm still bullish.

So the restaurant I was looking at doesn't accept it, but it's cool that this new criteria is there!
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:49:34
Lol, I FOMO'd too. Got it at 7700 when I was contemplating 6800 last night. D'oh!
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:35:03
Nice try...

Never kept mine on the exchanges to begin with.
