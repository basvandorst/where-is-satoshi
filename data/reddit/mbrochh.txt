Lightning will ride us to 100k. The following death of 80% of all other crypto will ride us to 200k. The new world order that will now be possible to be built (micro transactions to Africa and between machines) will ride us to 400k. That will trigger the Singularity and after that nothing matters any more. Some of us will live a decadent life in a citadel on the moon, playing god while an AI manages our finances but then this Rastafarian dude transports this street samurai into our villa and he breaks through our ice and fucks everything up.

Same happened to me when I bought a Trezor, but at least they give you a ticket number and when the transaction finally arrives, they still count it as paid.
Ledger can clearly see on the blockchain when you initiated the transaction. The fact that they deem the transaction invalid just because a few hours passed, is outrageous. Clearly a bug fault in the way they handle payments.

BCH is a scamcoin solely made to preserve ASICBOOST. It's 8 MB blocks will lead to total miner centralisation. It's non existant developer pool will lead to it's eventual catastrophic failure. It's main "spokesperson" is also the main attack vector and another reason why this coin cannot be considered decentralized.
Decentralization is the only thing that gives a cryptocurrency actual value.

Everything that you say is wrong.
1. so what? due to volatility it will be worth a little more or a little less but it is indeed guaranteed that that it is still worth something around the same. stop splitting hairs.
2. how long it will take to transfer is irrelevant. a bank transfer on a Friday will take at least until Monday, an international wire transfer to some shit country can take a whole week. I have made hundreds of BTC transactions, not a single one took longer than 24 hours.
3. what currency it is, is irrelevant. what the fuck are you even talking about? the currency is BTC.
4. The amount is irrelevant. The point was: I could send you even a BILLION dollars and _no one_ could prevent me from doing it.
5. I'm making transactions every single week, since four years. I *always* chose a 10 sat/byte fee. That's a $0.80-$1.20 fee for a billion dollar transfer. I think that's a pretty good deal.
6. The whitepaper talks about the endgame scenario. There will be no more conversions to fiat.
7. every technology ever invented took years upon years before it was refined enough to enter the mainstream stage. Do you have any idea how unbelievably shitty the internet was when the first normal households started getting it around 1996? It was already more than 10 years old by then. Look what we have now. 
Fees are too high, the mempool can be spammed too easily and there is not enough anonymity on the blockchain. For all these problems we will find solutions in due time.

They should discuss how to securely store coins. 
They should discuss tax implications. 
They should discuss autonomous corporations. 
They should discuss the imminent death of the nation state and the total global chaos that will ensue. People will die.
They should discuss the pseudo-anonymity and it’s consequences.

At some point the protagonist hangs out with some punk who works at a movie theatre.

@_date: 2017-12-12 16:32:50
I think my reasoning is manifold. TL;DR is I'm probably simply a BTC maximalist.
As I said, I'm not really into it to get rich quick, but for the social change.
I have been earning money in software development for almost 20 years, I have read Andreas' books on bitcoin, I have spent reading about bitcoin on reddit/Twitter for averaged 2-3 hours per day for the last five years, I have been deeply involved with open source software for 10+ years. I'm not good at math, so I can never be a true cypherpunk, but I fully understand how the technology works, and it works great. I don't see the need for any alt. I just don't see it.
I also have actively witnessed the Internet to become what it is today from horribly slow baud modems giving me access to usenet and IRC (sitting on my dad's lap, enjoying to slap H4ckerB0y75 with a big large trout) to streaming 4k movies on iTunes and now witnessing the rise of AI -- Anyone claiming that bitcoin has unsolvable scaling problems and that bitcoin is dead is a god damn fool in my opinion. These people are either greedy, impatient, stupid, or naive/unexperienced.
There is no other coin out there that is as anti-fragile and decentralized as bitcoin, and this feature of decentralization, to me, is THE ONLY feature that truly matters. Bitcoin might actually never scale, but that's OK. I have always been able to buy a latte, with cash, completely anonymously. That's not a problem that bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) really needs to solve. I have never been able to experience financial freedom, and that's a problem that bitcoin has solved perfectly.
Charlie is a smart and super nice guy, so I respect him, Vitalik met Putin, so I don't respect him, but that doesn't matter - both are single points of failure with hidden agendas. As a consequence, their coins are worthless. Furthermore, there is TONS of innovation on the horizon that will render 70% of all alts obsolete. I don't have the time to monitor progress on all these fronts to pull out my money from alts when they inevitably experience their death blows.
Finally: Bitcoin is truly a work of a genius. We have what, 1200 altcoins now? Come on man, what are the odds that Satoshi somehow created the spark of genius everywhere in the world and everyone is a financial and mathematical genius suddenly. The reality is: 90% of all alts are simple scams. And while I might be smart enough to ride the pumps and dumps to make a fuck tonne of money, the reality is that this would be another full time job (basically being a day trader) but I already have a fulfilling (and more meaningful) full time job, so I simply can't be bothered.

Would it make any sense for such a manufacturer to sell these miners to anyone? Why not use them themselves until the difficulty rises and then sell them off?
Is it simply because it's a more stable business model? They don't want to earn BTC while it is uncertain how the BTC price might develop?
Or is it that electricity in that country is simply too expensive and people elsewhere will pay crazy prices for these miners because their electricity is unfairly cheap?

I personally hold my coins because I am certain that one coin will be worth 1mio and more in the near future.
In that regard, I'm in the get rich quick boat.
On the other hand, experiencing financial freedom... well, it is an exceptional experience that I have never experienced in my 35 years on this planet. The fact that I know that my hard earned saving (and believe me, I work *hard*) now will at least retain it's value, or might even grow in value, is just unbelievable.
I went from living paycheck to paycheck and the permanent fear that just one misstep in life would basically end my life (healthcare bills, or bank accounts frozen) - to being a free man. I'm already a digital nomad. If this country outlaws bitcoin, I can immediately settle to another one. I have ultimate freedom. This "utility" of bitcoin is simply put: priceless.
I'm also a privileged white male, so I earn more than I deserve, more than I really need, AND YET, thanks to bitcoin, I'm saving every penny. I finally stopped living from paycheck to paycheck and started proper budgeting so that I have more left over at the end of the month that I can move into bitcoin. I have stopped being a mindless consumer and started being a mindful consumer. I don't buy useless shit any more. I hear that many people experience this and the insane culture of consumerism that is currently killing the planet has been concerning me for years. Thanks to bitcoin, I feel no longer helpless. This thing might actually fix the planet. Companies that produce useless shit will simply go out of business in the next 10 years.
Let's get back to the "get rich quick" thingy. I have this suspicion that bitcoin will reset the global balance sheet. It will suck up all money supply like a black hole and during hyperbitcoinization, an event that will probably occur in 2-6 years, the nations that have actual strong currencies will be able to buy more bitcoins, the nations that have worthless currencies, will not be able to buy many bitcoins. In the end, we will have a new world order, but I guess the powers will probably still be pretty much aligned in the same way like today. Asia will be much better off than the western world.
The notion of "how much is a USD worth" will become completely meaningless. On paper, thanks to bitcoin, I will be fantastically rich, maybe in the trillions of USD, but that will be completely meaningless. Today's ultra rich will still be tomorrow's ultra rich (except the stubborn ones who dismiss bitcoin until the very end). Today's poor will still be tomorrow's poor (except the very ballsy ones who bet all their savings on bitcoin in 2011, correct - now is too late already). I will still be some small fish somewhere in the upper-middle-class. Because I was an early adopter, I will be elevated one social level higher than what I would have been able to achieve as a normal part of the work force, but that's it. 
My actual buying power will probably not be much more than what it is today. And the world will be thrown into utter chaos as mankind tries to adjust to a new currency that seemingly came out of nowhere like a Tsunami. If you only own 10 bitcoin, psychologically, that sounds like a very small number. You better cling to it for life, How am I supposed to decide what is a fair value for a loaf of bread when my total wealth   is only "10"? I'd be scared to even spend 0.0001 on a bread (and I couldn't, because of mining fees, haha).
So yeah, I'll be much richer than today, but I'll probably refuse to spend it until I die. I will be rich, but my life will not change much. So in that sense, I think I'm more in it for the social change and not so much for getting rich. I love my work and I wouldn't know how to spend great riches anyways.
I just want to be free.

We have one at hackerspace.sg near Lavender MRT at King George's Avenue.
Last time I checked, there was an error message on the display, though, and the guy who is running it is currently overseas, if I'm not wrong.
If this is urgent you could send an email to the hackerspace.sg mailing list and ask if someone can tell you if the machine is currently operational.
If the person in need stays a bit longer and has a work permit and local bank account, fybsg.com is the easiest way to buy bitcoin in Singapore.

Checked the description:
At the demise of empire, City of London financial interests created a web of secrecy jurisdictions that captured wealth from across the globe and hid it in a web of offshore islands. Today, up to half of global offshore wealth is hidden in British jurisdictions and Britain and its dependencies are the largest global players in the world of international finance.

If bitcoin works, hyperbotcoinization will render your grandma's retirement funds worthless in about three to five year's time. She is too old to fully understand this technology, let alone embrace it. She is also too old to take a risky step and move her funds into bitcoin. Therefore, she is trapped in a shitty situation. All she can hope is that bitcoin will take just a bit longer to break into mainstream so that she won't live to see the consequences.
She has a good reason to be pissed.

When it ran to 1200 it was because of MtGox and when it crashed, that was also because of MtGox, We don't have a MtGox any more so the situation today is completely different.
I agree that it will trade sideways for months until LN generates real organic demand, but I very strongly doubt it will drop to 3k levels.

EDIT: Turns out he might not be wrong.
Pretty sure what you are saying is wrong.
The word list doesn't matter at all. You can even type in your own words if you want.
These twelve words are nothing else than a key with A LOT of characters. Compare this:
to this:
eat meat heat my
both are 16 character keys, but the latter is SO MUCH EASIER to remember and to type in quickly and without typos.
The wallet software now takes that key and uses a special algorithm to create your wallet keypairs based on this key. The magical thing is: Every time that algorithm creates keypairs from your 12 words key, it creates exactly the same keypairs in exactly the same order.
Therefore, as long as your wallet software uses the same algorithm to create keypairs based on the initial key, you will always get back access to all accounts in your wallet.
So it's the algorithm that matters and your 12 words key, not the total wordlist.

@_date: 2015-01-28 08:04:09
But aren't you talking about the process of deriving the words - which you only do the very first time you setup your wallet?
When you get a new computer and want to re-install your wallet, you don't need to derive new words. You need to enter the old words in order get back your old wallet?
I still don't see how the word list matters in this case.

Create a contract with her:
1. She will give you a small amount that she doesn't mind losing, let's say $20 per week
2. You will work for it. Let's say you wash her car, mowe the lawn, walk the dog, buy groceries, repair the broken bulp in the cellar - anything!
3. You invest the coin and every week after you invested you show her the balance and the current value.
After 12 weeks she will see that her investment went up 30%. Now you ask for more per week (ie $50), but you do the same amount of simple housework.
After 6 months the investment will be up 90% and you will have a non-trivial amount of profit. Now you just take the money every week but don't work for it any more.

Small difference, I guess. Both can be stolen. But if your gold gets stolen, it's gone for good.
If this gets stolen, I have a small window of time where I can get to my second one, initiate a new wallet with it and move my funds before the thiefs do it.
Also: If it gets stolen I can at least watch on the blockchain where my money moves to, which might help the police a little bit.

My business puts 10% of all profits into bitcoin every month. We have to pay 17% corporate income tax when we realise any gains, but hey, I'd gladly pay that and take 100% gains every 8 months vs. just letting the money rot on a business bank account without any interest at all.

Some people deny climate change and they end up becoming the POTUS, which is prestigious, powerful and profitable as fuck.
These people, against all common sense, simply succeed because some other people with infinitely deep pockets are heavily invested in oil and war and such things.
This debate is not about logic and has never been about logic. It is about people with deep pockets pushing their agendas. There is no amount of logic, facts and good arguments that will convince the deep pockets.

As soon as Google figures out how to embed ads in the blockchain, they'll be all over it.
Where the heck is Google's self driving car?
Where the heck is Google's VR/AR glasses?
Where the heck is Google's social network?
Where the heck is Google's global free internet from high altitudes?
Where the heck is Google's OSS code hosting platform?
Google is an ad company.
If they ever do anything with blockchain, the name Google won't be anywhere near it, it will be one of the Alphabet companies instead - maybe they already have one?
I think Google is much more interested in AI and focuses all their efforts on that.
And who knows - if Bitcoin was really invented by a secret think tank, I think a group of global mega corps would be behind it - those companies have the biggest interest to erode nation states because they will be the next runner ups for wielding massive power.

@_date: 2017-08-27 10:23:21
It's quite obvious (I think): Block reward is halved, mining this coin becomes unprofitable, miners switch to BTC, BCH difficulty drops dramatically via EDA, miners come back to BCH.
Repeat. 
All coins will be mined much much faster that you would think, the inflation will make the price drop even further, making the coin unprofitable, dropping the difficulty even further.
At some point, the difficulty will be so low, that some rich guy will point some data center at the BCH chain and perform a 51% attack and kill the chain for the lulz.
So obviously BCH will have to hard fork again and change their algorithm somewhat to prevent all this.

I don't understand that logic. The reward halves. So the price only needs to double.
And it will already be priced in during the years leading up to it, so at the moment of the halvening, nothing much will happen.
EDIT: Looking at the charts, I was wrong, it was priced in in a bull run the month before
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:20:41
As far as I understand it, when you get your salary, you would move it into a lightning channel and then keep spending for whatever you need during the month.
So most people will probably get away with just one transaction per month (but that one transaction will have some hefty fees).
I don't quite understand how people in poor countries are supposed to take part in all this. If opening a channel is already more expensive than a month's worth of salary for them, it's all pointless.

This only works if you had BTC BEFORE August 1st and if you had them in a wallet where you control the private keys (i.e. Electrum or Trezor).
1. You create a new wallet with a new seed (i.e. electrum)
2. You send your entire balance from your old wallet into your new wallet
3. You install Electron Cash ON A DIFFERENT computer and enter the seed from your OLD WALLET. Electron Cash will show your entire balance, but now it is BCH.
4. You create an account at Kraken and send all your BCH into Kraken.
5. You sell all your BCH for BTC on Kraken
6. You withdraw from Kraken into your new wallet
Done. You can delete your old wallet, delete the Electron Cash wallet and forget your old seed.
I made $15k this way.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:53:19

Whatever you put in now will DEFINITELY 2x in the very near future, most likely 10x within 3 years and, if no other coin eats BTCs lunch, possibly 100x in the next 8-10 years.

@_date: 2017-08-25 06:00:19
There are a few such subreddits that attempt just that and they are all super low volume and basically pointless.
You would also have the same issues that you have here (sockpuppets, trolls, vote brigading, hidden agendas).
The hilarious thing about bitcoin is that it solves the problem of "trust" in a technical manner, but seemingly no one involved in the project can be trusted :)
Reddit is not a suitable medium for a highly manipulated and highly polarising topic like bitcoin and I think this will eventually be the downfall of Reddit. They haven't touched the look and feel of the site in ages or added any new features. So what the fuck is their engineering team doing, other than ensuring 99% uptime (which is kind of rocket science in itself, of course). If I were Reddit, I would put all engineering into mechanisms to prevent trolling and manipulation, but we all know that this will never happen because investors love those crazy high activity stats.
I'm afraid, if you want real info and real discussion, you need to wade through shit here or get one level deeper and dive into the dev mailing lists or the older bitcoin forums.

The blockchain is tamper proof because every block is cryptographically signed with a hash that depends on the block before.
But this is still an interesting question. What if someone wrote a virus that just erases the blockchain files on everyone's computer?
I think the answer is: There is no way that such a virus could spread so fast that no one has time to react. People would notice this immediately, then update their virus scanners, problem solved. Those that got affected simply download the blockchain again from those who protected themselves in time.
Also: There are probably tons of nodes that just run silently in someone's basement and are not used for anything else. Those people most likely run Linux. Unlike that virus for Windows XP, I have never heard of a Linux virus that is able to spread to other Linux machines *just because they are online*. It's not like those node operators are sitting in front of their terminals and downloading random shit from porn and warez sites.
You might be able to put the virus into the core client on github and make everyone upgrade to the latest version and then activate it - but it's damn near impossible that this would pass code-review (and that's another reason why a fork like BCH or SegWit2x will never succeed). And even if you somehow managed to sneak that malicious code in, people simply don't update their clients in a timely manner. You would have to wait possibly years for everyone to upgrade before you could be 100% sure that everyone runs your malicious client before you can activate the wipeout.
I can't see any possible attack vector. Decentralisation is a wonderful thing.

$20 / week goes into bitcoin. This is my retirement money.
3 monthly salaries stay in my checkings account, this is for  sudden bills, vacations, gifts, whatnot.
Anything that I need in less than one year stays in my savings account, because I don't ever want to pay capital gains tax when moving coins and I don't want to put money into BTC today and when I urgently need it 3 months later, it might have just have had a sudden 10% drop.

I live in Singapore, which is often cited as one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world (and from my experience living here, yes, it really is). Vitalik even lives here. The government is quite pro-crypto. My bank here hasn't closed my account despite me pumping tens of thousands of dollars into ctrypto.
And yet: You will not see a Bitcoin logo anywhere in the wild here. I have heard of a micro brewery that accepts bitcoin, three years ago, but I never went to see if it is actually true. There are some ATMs, for example one at HackerspaceSG, but last time I visited it showed a blue screen of death.
Many people have heard about it, but almost everyone doesn't understand the concept and thinks it is a scam. No one I know actually owns any, except my closest friends and colleagues, because I bought coins for them.
Mainstream feels different. But we are getting there. I don't mind having another slow three years of a head-start, to be honest ;)

I was there at the last halvening, F5-ing the shit out of my keyboard... nothing happened.
Just checked the charts again. I guess you are right, though. It was priced in the month before (JUN), went from 400 to 800. Then went sideways at 600 for a few months and shot up to $1000 in December (probably not related to the halvening any more, though).

Correct. Owning a car is only for status symbol or when you have kids - but even with Kids, just riding Uber would be much *much* cheaper than a car and you'd only really need it for the first five or six years.
And no, the trains stop around midnight, btw, it's not 24/7. But yes, they are extremely clean and safe and piss easy to use. And cheap. A five year old can literally manage to travel the entire country with the MRT system here.

As an even better investment you could do is: Read this book: 
Spend some time changing your diet (it's gonna be more expensive, but worth it), find some sports activities that you can build into your daily schedule (just walking fast enough so that your get slightly out of breath for 30 minutes a day can be enough) and get rid of that overweight! That will also solve your blood pressure problem and reduce heart attack risk by as much as 70%.
Fix the problem at it's root!
If all that sounds horribly difficult, see it as a way to feel young again, do something crazy, treat it like a new hobby.

It is best to also buy a Cryptosteel and put your 24 word seed into that, then store that in a very secure location. 
IDEALLY you should even get two and store them in two different locations, but you'll get more paranoid the more money you have in bitcoin (and then these kind of investments are peanuts to you anyways), so you don't need to worry about that right away.
In the beginning, having a Trezor and storing the seed written on paper, possibly laminated, and storing those papers in two secure locations, should be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:19:27
So you sold your reddit account 19 days ago? How much was it worth?

This is a very good comparison and even as a big Trezor fan I have to say that your security concerns are sound.
I'd be curious to hear the Trezor team's thoughts on this and if they plan to make it possible to enter everything on the device with the upcoming Trezor 2.0
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:43:36
I don't know how this list came to be, but they are on it:

How? Block time is still 10 minutes. Mempool is still full. How does SegWit help with payment times?
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:28:30
In the end it's all just energy and the CPU wastage on your device will cost you electricity cost and those will be higher than than the tiny fraction of a bitcoin you will earn from it.
I do believe it's kind of the end-game for 21.co, though.

True, but they should allow us to set the fee manually. When I transfer money out of an exchange, I almost never need it immediately. 
Hell, in 99% of all cases I'm transferring into my Trezor so that it can be HODLed there for 5-10 years, I really don't care how long this transaction takes.
Also: Doesn't the fee go straight to the miner? Coinbase earns nothing from this, or do they?

If we can somehow prevent the 2x of SegWit2x in November, then I would expect a bull run to 5-6k.
If the 2x part indeed forks off with 90% of the mining power and "core gets fired", then I'm afraid we are in deep deep shit, we will get a POW change and basically have:
1. Bitcoin (with SegWit, but no hash power)
2. BCash (irrelevant by then)
3. BitcoinSegWit2x (with hash power)
4. BitcoinNewPOW (with SegWit and super decentralised but possibly with economic consequences that no one can forsee)
In that future, all four options are shit.
Someone please correct me and tell me that I'm talking out of my ass.

stripe.com allows to collect bitcoin payments - I have never used it, though, so I can't say if the user interface is nice. My bet would be that it is very nice, however, they convert the coins directly into dollar for you, so if you want to earn BTC, this is not a good option.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:39:55
It's probably best for the devs to remain silent. If just one of them starts with something like "yeah well, I would have preferred the blocks to be small, but it looks like doubling them now really is the compromise we all need, I gonna keep coding on the new repo if I really have to" - THEN the 2x motherfuckers will suddenly have a lot of confidence in their own plan.

Yea true, but I would assume that there will be much more fees to collect from the pool of SegWit transactions vs. the pool of legacy transactions, so at some point, miners will have to pick them up or operate at a loss.

If the hardware wallet breaks, you just buy a new one and type in the same seed.
It's always the seed in the end, even with software wallets. You need to write it down and store it age/water/fire/theft-proof at two geographically different locations.
The seeds are generated from a standard. You can use the same seed with any wallet that supports that standard. So if your Trezor fails, and you need super urgent access to your coins, install Electrum and enter your seed there.

Why would a company want to sell their goods for a currency that goes down in value if they could sell it for a currency that forever goes up in value.
The consumer will simply have no choice. There will be an equilibrium where goods have discounts on BTC prices that are simply too good to ignore for most consumers. 
This will drive adoption, more consumers will move their fiat into bitcoin and fiat will de-value even faster. I cannot see any other way other than reaching a point of critical mass where bitcoin will become like a black hole that sucks up all fiat in a shockingly short time. I expect that this will happen when the bitcoin price will do it's final bull run from $100k to $1mio, probably 8 years from now.
Once everyone only uses bitcoin, the "why would you spend a deflationary currency" argument becomes moot. People have to eat, so people will spend. Simple as that.

Almost all exchanges require that you send in documents to prove your identity. So if privacy matters that much to you, you are going to have a hard time.
Localbitcoins can be considered an exchange, yes. You can meetup people in person to make your transactions and that is probably the easiest way to transact truly anonymously.
I think there are also P2P exchange, i.e. bisq.io - they are probably the future of bitcoin, but I have not gotten around to using one yet.

I told him, I'll keep those and when he has his own wallet I'll send them to him.

Let's say LN activates and suddenly you can buy latte at Starbucks.

You try again tomorrow. This time for 0.000001 BTC.

Been doing this since the peak in 2013. $20 every week. The price went down for the whole first year and then up for the whole next year and now my investment is up 161%. I started at the worst possible time in bitcoin history and got a 161% profit.
This is the most risk-free and worry-free way of doing it. 
The upside is: You will most definitely make a profit. The downside is: You'll be putting in such small amounts that it will probably never turn you into a millionaire - or if it does, you will be so old that you don't care about money any more.
I often day dream and fill in phantasy values into my spreadsheets like "what if 1 BTC would be $100,000 and even in that scenario I would JUST barely be a dollar-millionaire. Which makes sense. I don't see why I should suddenly be super rich just because I dumped the tiny amount of $2000 over the course of three years into a highly speculative investment.

You should not fear to sell one too early because it might go up. You are already a millionaire and your current stash will likely turn into a billion if you wait a few more years.
You should fear of selling the wrong coin and the one you are left this dies and you lose everything.
So the best thing to do is: Just keep all fork coins and don't worry about the FUD. Take no risks. You already made it and you will end up with 100mio sooner than you think, there is absolutely no need for you to gamble.

The idea is to type in a seed in front of their eyes and then it reveals a balance. You give them the money.
But then, you could have entered that seed with one additional word, your passphrase, and that would have opened a completely different wallet with even more money in it.

dude, what the hell are you doing? just do dollar cost averaging and buy every week whatever amount you could just as well flush down the toilet.
are you a smoker? stop smoking and invest that exact amount in bitcoin every Sunday.
I have been doing this for three years now and my investment is up 152%.
If you only have such small amounts to invest, you have to invest for the very very very long term. Hoping that the price doubles and you can turn $200 into $400 is stupid. It might work one time, but it WILL fail some other time and you will turn $800 into $200 and you will feel stressed out about it like hell. You should invest, knowing that you will NEVER turn it back into fiat. Wait 20 years until you can buy a house with BTC and suddenly you realise that you have amassed 10 BTC and it's actually enough to pay for a whole house.
Just buy $20 every week. Don't even look at the price. Just buy.

Everyone will try to do this and you will need balls of steel and some serious market insights to time the top and the bottom.
The reality will be this:
It will shoot through 100k. At 140k you shit your pants and sell.... only to see it shoot through all the way to 350k. Now you are freaking out, you are sitting on a lot of cash but your BTC holdings are down. Is this thing going straight to a million? Should you just buy back in? 
Luckily, the next day it finally crashes, but with that ATH, what is the bottom gonna be? Surely not 20k... maybe 40? Hell, even 60-80 seems reasonable? At 50k you just wanna play it save and buy back in.
In the end, you sold at 140 and bought back at 50. Still awesome, but not as good as you projected.
And that's THE BEST CASE SCENARIO. What is more likely to happen is, at your perceived peak, your marketplace is gonna crap out on you and you can't sell when you want to. Then, if you finally sell, your funds will be frozen and you will have to show proof where you got all those BTC from, then your government will try to fuck you over and squeeze some sweet sweet tax money out of you, if you move the money to your bank account, you will lose your bank account, if you leave the money on the exchange, you will worry every single day that the exchange will get hacked, then, at your perceived bottom, if you managed to unfreeze your accounts, you can finally buy back, only to regret it the next week when it tanks even more and you realize that you could have bought back later.
All this fucking hell ride will take place over a timespan of 2-3 years and you will basically have to observe the charts day and night.
Just work hard, take extra jobs, earn bitcoin through work, accumulate as much as you can and then do this crazy gamble with 10% of your holdings so that you can at least approach this with somewhat of a peace of mind.

All good questions, but so many, it's hard to answer them all and create a focused discussion.
1) bugs are always possible, but given that bitcoin had 99.9% uptime in the last 10 years and given that the number of contributors to the source code is steadily growing that possibility is getting smaller and smaller every day. I'm not concerned about that at all.
2) Fuckups can and will happen. But that's why new features always take ages to really get activated. First the code is watched by dozens, maybe hundreds of skilled devs, second, they have a test suite to run locally during development, third they try new features extensively on the testnet first, and lastly once a new version with a new feature comes out, these new features are pretty much always backwards compatible, so it takes months or years for miners and wallets to slowly embrace those features. If a major fuckup, against all odds, made it all the way into mainnet, only the first few pioneers who upgrade quickly will be affected and then a patch will be rolled out quickly.
Yes, big blockers are just bullshitting. Segwit has no downsides. Decentralisation is THE ONLY THING that counts for bitcoin.
3) Mining pools are a point of weakness at the moment, but we got this far and survived takeover attempts by the most powerful pools. As we reach the physical limitations of how small mining hardware can get, the half-life of the hardware will get longer, the hardware will become smaller and get cheaper. That is when we reach a new era of bitcoin where mining will become truly, mind blowingly decentralised, as every device, like all our smartphones, fridges and toasters will mine coins with idle CPU cycles. Also, as the price rises, miners have lesser and lesser incentive to try attack the very thing that made them unimaginably rich. Game theory is amazing.
4) Even in 2019, we can be quite certain that 90% of all companies that accept btc use payments processors that immediately convert btc to fiat. I don't see anything bad about this. What counts is that btc is used and in circulation so that liquidity goes up and volatility goes down over time. Of course these companies would do better to hoard the coins, but that opens a can of worms (security, tax implications, unclear regulations) that most companies are not equipped to deal with.
I'm a maximalist, so to me the endgame of bitcoin is to become deeply woven into the fabric of society, just like the internet is today. I think that our planet can only sustain one blockchain, so all other chains will always be inferior because they are protected by less hash power. All other chains will also become useless as more layers on top of bitcoin will enable the very same things that these other chains are trying to solve.

I recently signed up for an account at DBS in Singapore. I did this while on my phone at the backseat of a car on the road from Malacca to Singapore.
I had to fill out a little questionaire on the DBS website m which took me about 5 minutes and at the end I got a message that I will receive an update soon.
That update came three days later: I had letters in my letterbox with my new account number, my new debit card and the pin for my new debit card and some token device for my new account.
At no point did I speak to a human or entered a bank building. I thought this was pretty damn awesome.
Still doesn't beat bitcoin, of course - but some countries are quite progressive.
Also in Singapore, I can now use an app to wire you money instantly just by typing in your phone number. It's called Paynow and PayLah. It's another thing that always feels like magic to me whenever I use it. It's another reason why no one in Singapore feels like anyone really needs bitcoin as P2P money - the banks already did it and the UI/UX is much better than bitcoin.
Of course I personally care more about the whole scarcity thing and the whole decentralized thing - but 99% of the population doesn't give a shit about any of this.

It only went this high because a few billion in market cap moved from altcoins into bitcoin in anticipation of the fork. Now that the fork is cancelled, those billions are moving back into their altcoins.
Just relax and wait for the next country to embrace bitcoin or the futures market opening or an ETF being announced or SegWit adoption rising (and fees falling) or BCH or ETH fucking up due to their incompetent developers or Amazon announcing BTC support or Lightning Network taking off or other awesome innovations happening in BTC or whales deciding that there is no more downward pressure and therefore starting the next media campaign to pump BTC again - and the price will shoot through the roof again.

No it's not. Merchants already tried BTC three years ago AND THEN ABANDONED it because it sucked. A few dollars more in fees every month is not gonna be painful enough for these merchants to lick their wounds and give BTC a second try.

1. Almost no brick and mortar shop accepts bitcoin, so someone like your aunt will have a difficult time to spend the coins
2. Cashing out into old school bank accounts is getting more and more difficult as most banks are starting to become really defensive against bitcoin. The risk of getting your account closed because you wired money to and from and exchange is going to get bigger (I had my Standard Chartered account closed last year).
3. Protecting and securing your coins is really really difficult for the layperson. So you have to chose between two bad options: Leave coins on exchange and hope exchange doesn't get hacked or store coins privately and hope you don't get hacked/robbed.
4. Taxation might be difficult and time consuming or even unclear depending where you live.
5. This is a long term investment. There is no getting rich quick. An aunty putting in money today should be prepared to not touch that money in the next eight years in order to get any amount of noteworthy gains. My parents for example are aware of that and for that reason they don't bother. They prefer to spend their money today as long as they still are healthy enough to do so. They don't see the point of missing out on experiences today but then sitting on a million dollars when they are vegetables in some old folks home.

Nothing of what you said has anything whatsoever to do with security.
If they get hacked, there is no reason to assume that they will just pay you back your coins. They are not philanthropist.
The fact that BTC is small change for them, is actually a reason to worry that they haven't figured out their security properly because there isn't enough at stake for them.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:29:22

@_date: 2017-11-19 10:34:08
Yes. Every time when you turn one coin into something else, you have to determine both item’s value and report on your gains.
What does it matter if it’s a pokemon card vs a magic card? 
Would you ask the same question if the magic card was a house? You are using the current value of the coin to obtain some other thing, and if the current value has changed, then you need to report gains or losses.

Hodler since 2014 here. The little dip in BTC didn’t impress me, I zoomed out to the 1w chart.
The insane pump of BCH scared the shit out of me, though. So glad that it is crashing as usual now. I suspect this wasn’t their last pump, though. They now know how much it costs to move the price. Next time they will bring in 10x more money.

Miners only switched to BCH because they knew that they could get many more blocks per hour, therefore, although the BCH price was shit, they could still make a profit by just selling loads of BCH.
When this ends, the BCH price will still be shit, there will be next to no fees added to the blockrewards, and they will only get one block every ten minutes. They will leave hundreds of thousands of dollars per day on the table if they stick to mining BCH. They will also eventually be desperate to sell their BCH to pay for electricity and since there is no one in the market except pump’n’dumpers and con-artists to create any kind of demand, their selling of BCH will create a massive downward pressure, tanking the price even more, until they reach a point where it’s not even enough to pay for electricity.

Would it be different this time, though?
Back in the days, only a couple hundred of basement dwellers knew about it and even considered wasting their time setting up the hardware and sucking away their parent’s electricity. These guys are running the show now, so kudos to their entrepreneurial spirit. By the time everyone else came on board, “forget about mining, just buy the coins” was already the common mantra.
This time though, after a POW change, millions of people everywhere on earth would set up their mining rigs at the same time and then stay in competition with each other. If the big whales wanted to compete with a few million people, they could try, but it would be a big gamble.

No one at BCH is showing even the slightest signs of making any efforts to overcome these barriers. They *want* these barriers. That is the whole point of their endeavour. They will get rich in the process, with with essentially criminal activity, but BCH will become a footnote in history.

But 75% or so is already mined. The last 100 years it could just as well be as if there is no block reward any more. Fees will make up the miner’s income.

It has survived one hostile takeover attempt (BCH),
Japan declared it an officially accepted currency. 
China banned it, but that somehow drove the price up. Confidence boosted: No country can ban this shit.
A futures market by CME Group is coming very soon.
It currently looks like it will also survive the next, much bigger, hostile takeover attempt.
China seems to be back, soon.
Before a BTC fork, the marketcap is sucked out of all altcoins, proving that all altcoins are worthless shit, only good for speculation, thus strengthening the confidence in BTC.

Yea. I know all that and I know past performance doesn’t predict future performance.
But Bitcoin is pure math. Fractals are pure math. 
I don’t think we are going all the way to 100k in a linear fashion from here.

I think the general idea is: If your thing kills the environment so badly, the number of concerned human beings will rise, these will leave your investment, they will create negative PR campaigns against your investment, they will try to physically destroy your investment, they will try to outlaw your investment and ultimately, they will out-science your investment and make it obsolete.
So in a very long timeframe, being bad for the environment will eventually kill your investment.

Not your keys, not your coins.
You might have heard this phrase before.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:28:23
I never really understood why this metric exists. 
Let’s say there are 100 coins and each coin costs $1, so the marketcap is $100.
Now I sell 1 coin and find a buyer who agrees to a price of $0.90 - I earned ninety cents, but the new marketcap is $90 - somehow $9.90 of marketcap have just evaporated into thin air.
So whatever these marketcap numbers are, there doesn’t seem to be any way to know how much actual cash could be cashed out of this system. Some catastrophic event could happen, people lose trust into the system, and the marketcap disappears over night just like that without any real value actually being moved.

@_date: 2017-11-06 23:44:01
OK so after all this drama, I still have not fully understood how a user can lose their coins?
If I don’t care about B2X because it is a worthless shitcoin, then I also don’t care about replay protection, right? I move my coins as usual on the BTC chain and I simply don’t care that they *might* also be moved on the B2X chain, right? I simply pretend that the B2X chain does not exist.
Furthermore, who gains from replaying a transaction on the other chain? Do they literally replay the same transaction with the same inputs and outputs? If yes, let’s say I send coins from one of my addresses to one of my other addresses and that is replayed on the B2X chain - does it matter? I still have all my coins there, don’t I? 
Let’s say I send BTC from my wallet into a receiving address on an exchange - yes, in this case I can imagine that the exchange web interface does not show me the same receiving address in the B2X wallet and if someone replays that transaction, then those B2X coins are indeed lost. But if the exchange has the keys for that address on the BTC chain, it must also have the same keys on the B2X chain so if I made enough noise, they should be able to eventually reveal my B2X balance, no?
If all the above is correct (which I’m sure it’s not), then it sounds like only the people who want to dump B2X are at risk because when they make B2X transactions, they might also move their BTC and if the exchange is being dishonest, they could refuse to show me the same addresses on both chains and just pocket my BTC - which surely would result in riots and law suites, so I still don’t really see the risk here.

A fool-proof way to pass on your coins to your heirs that doesn't involve a crazy treasure hunt that could fail if just one piece of the puzzle gets lost and that doesn't involve the need for third parties like banks and notaries (which can't be trusted) to safeguard the keys for decades.

You seem to follow the wrong people. I have been curating a Twitter list of Bitcoin people and I'm reading it like my newspaper almost every single day.

Let's assume, over time Bitcoin is used for EVERYTHING and has a marketcap of all other currencies combined.
To the moon, right?
I just can't wrap my head around this scenario. To a certain point this will work as it SLOWLY becomes mainstream. But after a while, don't we reach a tipping point where it rivals the use (and therefore liquidity and therefore value) of all other currencies?
Sure, the demand would grow and grow because everyone wants to get rid of their worthless dollars, but doesn't this mean that not only bitcoin appreciates in value but at the same time the other currencies DEPRECIATE in value (because nobody wants them any more).
Since the value gap would exponentially grow into both directions, we would end up at insane BTC values (like a hundred million dollars), but those values would be meaningless from todays point of view because you would also have to pay a thousand dollars to buy a piece of bread, right?

You are the early internet adopter. You got a modem and an email account and figured out how to subscribe to a mailing list on USENET.
And now you are writing long posts on the mailing list and you tell everyone how you love this technology but you are still cautious because this thing can’t possibly scale - if everyone attached cat pictures to their emails, the entire internet would be filled up and downloading the entire mailing list for one day would take longer than one day because the modems are so slow.

That depends on your home country. US people are taxed for their world income no matter what.
Germans can be taxed in Singapore and will then not be taxed again in Germany IF you spent more than 180 days or so in the other country. This works with countries that have a double-taxation-treaty with Germany.

If scenario 2 happens, I’ll end up with 100mio dollars worth of BTC maybe 4-8 years later than planned. I’ve DCA-Hoddled through a two-year bear market once, I can do it again.

Stripe.com allows to accept bitcoin and their UI/UX is generally very good.
I'm not sure if they take the same fees as for credit card payments - that would probably be a bit stupid.
I also don't know if they immediately exchange the BTC into your currency, that might also not be optimal for you, if you actually want to earn BTC.

If you want to trade crypto assets globally you still need to submit a fuck tonne of documents. This will change, but for now, I doubt it's much easier than trading traditional assets.

Bitcoin is as impactful of an invention as the world wide web.
Today, we can't even imagine in what ways it will disrupt life, just like in 1980 nobody thought that something like Netflix would replace cable TV.

I'd like to add one: Come up with an idiot proof way of handling death and pass on my wealth to my family.
I haven't thought too hard about this issue, yet, but everytime I do I end up in some chicken-and-egg problem.
I feel that this can only be solved by entrusting someone who is likely to survive my death (so my family is out of question, if I die by an accident, most likely a plane crash, they will all die with me) with my private keys.
I could either tell MORE people about this, which is crazy - as much as I love my parents and closest friends, I don't want 10 people on earth in three different continents running around having theoretical access to my wealth.
So that leaves us with banks or notary publics or something to store my keys... and well... why would I trust them? Bitcoin might kill banks (and all kinds of middle-men), chances are that they won't be too supportive of my cause.
tl;dr: I don't know how to hide my private keys and only release them to the correct people when I die in a foolproof way.

Just check if your printer model has internal storage and keeps saves of the files that you print.
If so, no idea how long those files would remain in that storage - probably until it's full, so in that case you should figure out how to wipe that storage or at least make sure that no one ever steals your printer.

But then they reach their work places and no matter how mundane the job is, let's say being a traffic security guy at the exit of a parking garage at minus ten degrees, they smile right at your face, they bow, they give you a wink to cross the street with such enthusiasm that crossing the street in front of a smelly parking garage exit itself becomes a tourist attraction.

As far as I can tell, we don't have any good marketplaces here with very high liquidity, so even if you sent me (I'm in Singapore) the coins, I wouldn't know how to quickly turn it into fiat and at what rate. An international bank transfer is likely the cheaper option. 
If you would somehow trust me and if you would send the coins, I would send them to my coinhako.com account and turn them into fiat there (coinhako takes 0.9% fees), then withdraw into my bank account, which would take 3 business days, then wire them to your desired local bank account, which would take less than one business day via FAST transfer.
So it would take at least 3 days and cost at least 0.9% of the coins that you would send.

Well... TV in this day and age is for stupid people only and is ateocious in pretty much every country (see "Hartz4-TV" in Germany). I haven't watched TV in 15 years :)
And SG now has more than 800 public basketball courts. I love to search them on google maps satellite view and then head down and play with the kids there - there are ALWAYS kids playing. I play almost every single day between 9pm and 11pm. And because I play so much, I don't sweat as much any more... 
I keep forgetting that my German friends still sweat when  I plan sightseeing-tours for when they come and visit me :)
I was concerned about the "iron fist" of the law here, but I have come to fully embrace it and love it. Death penalty for drugs, fines for spitting and chewing gums, no alcohol sales after 10pm, caning for molesting women or vandalizing places with graffiti - I love all of this, I'm a 204cm tall monster and don't really need to be scared anywhere in the world but nowhere feels as safe and perfect as Singapore. If I need some slightly more chaotic nights in my life, which is like three times a year at max, I can always hop to Bangkok or Hong Kong.

It will go below 3k because that would still be 3x higher than last year before the bull run.

[Coinhako.com]( seems to be the biggest player in the country. But you also need an [Xfers.io]( account. You send money to [Xfers.io]( first and then use that to deposit to Coinhako. Of course, everything is stricktly AML/KYC, so there are all kinds of deposit and withdrawal limits, but to moderately accumulate coins, it should be good enough. I used these services for a few years, then Coinhako/Xfers lost their bank account. They recently "re-opened" operations but I haven't tried them since.

I would get two cryptosteels and deposit them on two different continents and none of them in your own house.
But you will get to that level of paranoia once your holdings get big enough.
Even better would be three cryptosteel, then use shamirs secret sharing to create a 2of3 seed, then deploy the seeds on three continents, now you don't have to trust the people who hold a fragment of your seed (and these three people should not know about each other so they can't conspire against you).
Then the final problem is to find a way to inherit your coins, you could achieve that by setting up a dead-man's switch on Gmail that sends the three names to your attourney if you didn't check the switch for longer than 6 months (because you died). In your will you instruct the attorney to get together two of the three people whose names will be sent to him at some point after your death so that they can unlock your seed for your heirs.

If we actually reach that number, it will probably be after a fiat meltdown and therefore be meaningless because no one will accept USD any more. Who cares if it is worth 1mio of worthless USD? We will have to re-think what the true value of goods is when paid in BTC.

Here is what you should do:
1. Buy $50 every week, or at least every month. Don't look at the price, just buy i.e. every Sunday. DON'T obsess over the price chart every day. It's an utterly pointless activity. You can't influence the chart by staring at it and the money you are investing is a mid to long term investment, so this week's, month's, quarter's or even year's price movements are completely irrelevant to your life. Don't make grand plans about what you will do with the money because you have no idea how high it will go or how long it will take.
2. Once you have accumulated $500 of value, research about hardware wallets (i.e. Trezor) and Cryptosteel and buy those.
3. Once you have them, move your funds from the exchange into the hardware wallet.
4. All the time: Read about fractional reserve banking. Read about quantitative easing. Read about the "adoption S-curve". Read about Metcalfe's Law. Read about the average life span of a fiat currency. Read about the devaluation of the USD since inception.
5. Now you have $5,000 accumulated and you realize it will soon be worth $50,000. Find a way how to truly secure your funds (i.e. split keys, at least two Cryptosteels in two far away secure locations), learn how to inherit your wealth in case of a sudden death (this is a largely unsolved problem, as you can't trust anyone, especially not banks or notaries, so you have to be inventive).
6. Once you have made a 10x profit, cash out 10% and get back your initial investment and buy something nice. From now on, price swings no matter how bad won't scare you any more. In fact, when the price goes down, you will be happy, as it is a great opportunity to buy more.
7. Never read bitcoin dot com or  on Twitter. It is controlled by a criminal who is trying to highjack the bitcoin brand and trick people into buying "Bitcoin Cash", a worthless altcoin also called BCash. Speaking of altcoins and ICOs: Ignore them all, unless you have money to throw away or you are addicted to gambling. Yes, they make fantastic gains, but 99.9% of them are worthless scams, the gains are made by whales who simply buy and sell all coins at the same time to pump and dump then. You will eventually end up being a "bag holder", didn't manage to sell quick enough after the last dump and the next pump might never happen. It's truly like a casino. Without being extremely well informed and staring at the charts 24/7, you won't win this game. Better focus on your real job. 
8. IMPORTANT: When reading this sub, 
* ignore all memes! have a laugh and move on
* ignore all posts that predict "price will go to XXX this year"
* ignore all posts that say "country XXX banned/legalized crypto"
* ignore all posts that say "bitcoin soared to XXX because of event YYY" - these "correlations" are always utter bullshit
* ignore all posts from people like you, announcing that they just bought/sold XXX amount if BTC
All the above posts are FUD and FOMO posts that are manufactured by content farms and are used by "whales" to create a certain mood in order to help with their pump and dump operations. None of these posts have anything whatsoever to do with bitcoin and it's underlying technology, they are usually full of lies or unverifiable claims and are only designed to make you emotional. One does not invest with emotions. When this sub seems overwhelmed with posts of the same kind (usually: fees are so high, can't use BTC for anything any more), be aware that these posts are not made by real humans, but by bots and sockpuppet accounts. This sub seems hyper active and bustling with life, but you will soon realize that the signal to noise ratio here is insane. If you find one good and informative thread on any given day, it was a good day, otherwise it was simply and uneventful day.
* Read only posts where people discuss new technology (Lightning, Bulletproofs, MAST, Schnorr, Rootstock - if it has a word you don't know in the title, it's probably a good post)
* or posts where people ask for help, so you can learn about ways how other people fucked up and avoid it yourself.

1. If you lose the hardware wallet, you just buy a new one or install a software wallet that also supports 12/24 word seeds and initiate the new wallet with your existing seed - that's why you need to store the seed bomb secure in a cryptosteel.
2. If stolen, a thief cannot easily access it because they need a pin to enter the wallet. However, with an electron microscope or something they can extract your seed and once they have the seed they don't need your pin any more. To mitigate that attack vector you should use a "passphrase", which is a 25th word that is not even stored on the device.
3. No full blockchain download is needed. So to some extend you have to trust the Trezor web-interface but I don't see any issues with that.

No, for us. When the fork happens, you can sell the other coin for BTC. This will reduce their price and make mining less profitable. Those 80% of miners will quickly withdraw their support when they see that mining the original BTC is twice as profitable.

Hmm not sure about that. Clickbait is sometimes hard to argue. If a user spams the same post into 20 subreddits in one minute it's obviously a bot and we should ban the user.
If a post has "Bitcoin surges/drops XX%" in the title, it should be deleted. We all know what the price does and we can set price alerts on Bitstamp etc, these posts have no other purpose to change the mood of the sub and trick a few hundred thousand noobs into feverishly buying/dumping coins, which usually never ends well for the noobs.

You buy them at an exchange.
bitstamp.org is quite good. You wire transfer money into the exchange, then you buy BTC.
You store them in a wallet. electrum.org is good at the beginning, once you have invested more money and get more paranoid, you should move them into a trezor.io and get a Cryptosteel (google it).
You can buy many things with them online, however, it seems to be a much smarter move to buy them and “just HODL them”, as a hedge against a looming catastrophic economic disaster that would render traditional currencies worthless. If you really spend BTC to buy goods and services, you will want to buy back the spent BTC as fast as possible.
There are very few physical stores that accept bitcoin, but if you have some in your area that you frequent, you will want a mobile wallet (i.e. breadwallet) and then you load a smaller amount into that mobile wallet, just like you withdraw small amounts of cash at an ATM into your fiat wallet every week.

They don't. The NYA was made behind closed doors between a handful of people who are all on the payroll of the same entity. It's a scam and a charade to create the illusion of consensus or support.
If and when the fork actually happens, the market will decide and there is no way in hell that the majority of people who have invested into bitcoin for years, who have invested non-trivial amounts of money and who have done their homework and read about and understand bitcoin, people who are looking forward to all the innovation that is lined up, soon, will suddenly say:
"yeah, I got 1000% profit from my investment, and the current team of developers really did a nice job so far, but why don't we, just for a change of scenery, let these two (!!!!!) other developers give it a try and fire the current ones. What could possibly go wrong?"

It's not obvious. Why waste time and effort buying with bitcoin when I then have to waste extra time and effort to reload my BTC balance - I will most likely even make a loss because the BTC price went up after my purchase.
This is only obvious when the merchant gives a hefty discount for payment in BTC - a discount much bigger than just the 2.x% payment gateway fee from VISA.

My parents live in a townhouse. It is connected to 5 other houses. The street in front of the house belongs to some rich motherfucker who owns most of the land in that village. He is too stingy to fix the road in front of those houses. So we tried to make an effort and raise funds from all five parties who live there and fix the road on our own. No luck, for years and years and years there was always at least one party too stingy to cough up the money. As a result, the “street” in front of our house has been a shitty brown patch of dirt that turns into a brown river when it rains for my entire life.

It fades, burns, gets wet, crumbles - even if you laminate it - if you print it, you need a printer that doesn't save what you print in memory, if you hand write it, you need to be god damn sure you still can read it 20 years later.

German here. Nothing of this will actually happen. Germany is "digitally" and "technologically" so far behind, it will never recover from ignoring technological advancements of the past two decades.
This is the country that forces every single website owner to have an "Imprint" even on their personal blog and enforces the rage inducing stupidity that is the "cookie law".
Running businesses of any kind is a bureaucratic nightmare in Germany, taxation is insane, it is the country with pretty much the slowest internet speed in the whole of Europe, even behind countries like Ukraine or the Czeck Republic, and an abysmally low amount of tech entrepreneurs. Most of my "IT friends" form university time back in 2001 STILL don't know what github is and they all still use Windows. 
If you find a tech entrepreneur in Germany, it's probably a Silicon Valley hipster who rented an abandoned loft house in Berlin because the rent and food is cheap in our bankrupt capital. In fact, if you uttered the word "entrepreneur" to a random middle class stranger on the street, he would look at you confused and tell you that he doesn't speak French.
I left the country for Singapore. After eight years in Singapore, whenever I go back to Germany, I'm hit by a reverse-culture shock.

4 billion for a global phenomenon is like 1 million people investing $4000 each. That's fucking peanuts. And that's one million people who acted on their own, against all warnings from the media, hopefully putting in money they can afford to lose. Politicians would gleefully let it fail just so that they can say "I TOLD YOU SO!"
And if it goes away over night, no crucial infrastructure is lost, no significant amount of jobs is lost, as far as 99.99% of all people on earth are concerned, nothing at all would change.
Bitcoin is far, far, far away from being too big to fail.
EDIT: I was retarded and read that as "4 Billion" and not "Point four: Billions".
I still think the establishment would love to see it fail and not deem it as too big to fail. It's still peanuts we are talking about. Make that 100million people investing 6k each, globally. A drop in an ocean.

They might show up in the app near instantly, but until they got a confirmation, the transaction is not done. 
Depending on our fee, it can take between 10 minutes and 72 hours for your transaction to get confirmed - or if your fee is too low, it will never get a confirmation and eventually disappear from both your wallets.

I would never ever give my private key to anyone.
What if your coins suddenly move? Your chances to prove that your notary robbed you are essentially zero. Your notary will claim that you yourself must have made a mistake and lost your key to a hacker.
The only way I could imagine this, is to let the notary create the key himself, like creating a paper wallet and naming you a receiving address and then you just move coins into that address. If those coins ever move, the notary has clearly fucked up. But now all the burden of securing your coins is on the notary and I have my doubts that there is a notary alive on this planet today who has the technical knowledge to keep coins secure for the long term. Also: If you ever needed to access your coins, you’d need to make a trip to your notary and he would make you pay for wasting his time.

BCH is still there and eager fuck things up. They could change their EDA algo and stop the crazy hash rate oscillations and suddenly become a somewhat useable alternative to bitcoin. Add in a little pump by deep pockets to push up the BCH price and it would start siphoning away hashpower from BTC again.
That would scare the shit out of BTC holders and would put an abrupt stop to the current bull run.

At least when you use a Trezor it also seems like you can send and receive anything from/to anywhere:  (see headline Cross-compatibility summary)
I think the problem is, when your exchange does not support SegWit, then you probably need to be careful when you want to cash out, you must not provide a SegWit address, but one of your Legacy addresses.

1. Be in it for the long run
2. Only invest trivial amounts per week that don't affect your life at all (money that you could light on fire for the lulz)
After a few years, you will have invested 5k, but when you think about it, there is no need to cash out at all. That money did not affect your lifestyle at all - you still got your vacations, you bought your smartphones, you ate at fine restaurants, you bought birthday gifts, you saved some money for cloudy days.
Why would you cash out those 5k? You don't need them. You would end up leaving them lying around in your bank account and eventually you'll just use them to buy even more bitcoin - and in that case you should never have cashed them out in the first place.
BUT: If you invested 5k and it's now worth 50k. Then I would cash out the 5k and use that as play money to diversify into other coins or try to time the market. If you lose THAT money - well, we have already established that this money never affected your life, so fuck it.

I was the happiest in my life when I left Germany and relocated to Singapore, 8 years ago.
I literally put everything I owned on ebay and sold it all over two weekends. Since then, all my belongings fit into one backpack and one big luggage.
This is the closest I ever got to the feeling of true freedom. I do not ever want to own anything physical ever again.
The future is the sharing economy and micro-payments anyways. I will rent a Tesla, when I need it. I will rent a  bicycle, when I need it. I will rent an AirBnB, when I need it. The era of owning physical things is over.
While my Bitcoin stash is substantial and currently makes up 90% of my liquid assets, I have much more wealth in shares of the startups that I have founded and co-founded.
I will never be cash-wealthy enough to buy 100 BTC, so doing real work and creating wealth that way is the more realistic option for me to start an empire (it’s also a lot more fun, more rewarding, more interesting, more challenging and simply more human than just sitting around and trading).
So that’s what I will continue to do, until I die. All I need for my work is in-ear headphones a seat at Starbucks and a fully charged MacBook Pro.
If bitcoin goes to the moon, the ones who really profit from it are my clients, because I can work pro-bono and for shares only, and my children, because they will be set for life. My own lifestyle will likely not change.
And of course, I’ll never exit. Bitcoin will obliterate fiat. Where we are going, there is no exit.

Isn’t it that the node count doesn’t really matter? What matters are economic nodes, i.e. nodes that broadcast actual transactions. Those would be the nodes of the exchanges and of users who actively use their nodes as wallets.
Nodes that are spawned in the cloud are meaningless. All they do is push a narrative, which can be abused by media and propaganda to lure uneducated people to believe that this war has been won: “See B2X has 10x more nodes, we truly have consensus”.
As long as both sides have a handful of nodes, these nodes will uphold the rules of their blockchain and that’s it. Adding 1000 more nodes to the other chain doesn’t limit the capability of the handful of nodes on the first chain.
At least this is my understanding from reading this sub for a long time, if I am wrong about the network effects of the nodes, I’m happy to learn more!

I disagree with both your arguments:
1. Anyone can create a new coin and remain completely anonymous.
2. The wealth distribution is probably much, much worse than with fiat. Early whales who mined with GPUs have all the coins, now a handful of miners have all the coins. The average Joe will never even get close to obtaining 1 BTC. You will have the exact same 0.1% elite owning all the wealth, just like we have today.

Because hard forks give clarity about who are good and bad actors. This allows investors to focus on the good actors with increased confidence. They also proves bitcoin’s anti-fragility and generate more trust into the system.
People also sell all their alt-coins to increase their BTC balances so that they can get more air-drop coins at the fork. This pumps up the BTC price. This also shows that all alts are merely speculative assets to toy around with for traders and have essentially zero value, which in turn increases the confidence of everyone else into bitcoin.

You can easily transfer coins to your Trezor and you don't need any other equipment.
I recommend a Cryptosteel, though, for storing the seed of your Trezor wallet, but for starters you can just do with a piece of paper and store that at two different locations (not in the same house/neighborhood).

True but in such an event, the combined value of all forks will be lower than today’s BTC value. If a crypto currency can be taken over by a bunch of CEOs, then humanity is not ready for this invention and this was a failed experiment.

It’s piss easy to fire up nodes in the cloud. It will also be glaringly obvious when the S2X fraudsters start doing it because there will be a giant spike in the historical node count charts.
So their propaganda will be “See? Overwhelming consensus!” and our counter-argument will be “What? 5000 new nodes in three days? That doesn’t look like organic growth driven by real humans”. It would backfire on them, Streisand effect and all that.
You can also create cleaned-up charts and filter out all nodes with IP addresses in the known ranges of AWS, Digital Ocean and the likes.
I think, worrying about inflated cloud-nodes really is the least of our problems.

I won't bother to do some research to tell you exactly why your coin is shit but you said that it is "free and instant" so I can already tell you with great confidence that nano is a shitcoin.
To answer your question generally:
We don't really care about zero fees and instants payments.
The only thing we care about is working towards maximum possible decentralisation (still ways to improve) because that ensures bitcoins antifragile, immutable and censorship resistant nature, which in turn ensures it's value.
As a secondary goal, we obviously try to get fees and transaction time as low as possible but WITHOUT compromising on the main goal.

You will never be able to buy a billion $ worth of antminers because they are always sold out in advance. 
It would also look very suspicious if all those miners went to the same buyer. If it can be traced back to you, you would probably have assassins trying to kill you or if you are a government, you would face sanctions from other governments. 
So you would also have to create a large network of buyers distributed to many different countries and somehow get the entire next batch of Antminers just for yourself - which is impossible because they simply don't produce more miners than 50% of the current hash rate in one batch and you simply won't be able to buy an entire batch for yourself.

You will need to “taint” your coins with a newly minted coin from a new block on the original chain after the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:48:37
My guess is: The same amount as today. Thinking in terms of “millionairs” will be meaningless, though.
Some time in the next six or eight years we will witness a chain reaction of hyperbitcoinization - one bitcoin will be worth a million dollars, or even much more. But that is not because bitcoin becomes more valuable, it is because people will percieve fiat to be less valuable.
Everyone will move their buying power into bitcoin, but no matter what the bitcoin price is, the buying power will remain roughly the same. Those who got in earlier (us right now) will be rich, some stubborn of today’s millionaires, who refused to get in until hyperbitcoinization begins, will lose most of their value, so for every bitcoin millionaire made, a fiat millionaire will be killed.
The people who will suffer the most are the elderly and uneducated who are not following the news and those who have all their savings in fiat only (what’s that? maybe 60% of the population?). Pretty much over night their savings will become worthless before they even have a chance to convert it. I think (and hope) that society won’t collapse: these people usually live off of monthly payments from the government or pension funds, so after the financial apocalypse they will simply receive their next payment in bitcoin and still survive, but the little they had saved to give to their heirs, pay for sudden healthcare bills or even their own funeral will be lost.
The number of total millionaires will be the same, but we will not call them millionaires any more. 
The only potential true millionaire left will be Satoshi.

Yes but losing all core developers and replacing them with an anonymous hacker is probably a bad thing.
I wouldn’t be surprised, though, if this is actually Core’s hedge against B2X - imagine... what if B2X against all odds gets more hashpower over a prolonged period of time and eventually has more marketcap than BTC and suddenly the maintainer of Bitcoin Gold gives commit access to the repo to all current Core maintainers and removes himself? Genius move. I’ll hold my Bitcoin Gold for a while after B2X.

I paid $46 when I moved four years of dollar-cost-averaged bitcoin purchases from electrum into my Trezor.

Reaching $61k is not a certainty. This could take another 6 years. The banks might succeed in destroying bitcoin.
And you might fuck up and lose access to your keys.
I’d say: No. Too risky. Buy one whole bitcoin now, then put in small amounts every week. 
Establish a frugal lifestyle (use a budgeting app like youneedabudget.com - seriously this shit works, the app helped me put an additional 10k into bitcoin when I usually was broke at the end of each month for my entire life). If bitcoin works, it will be the end of consumerism, so why not learn to get used to it today. Any cash that you have leftover at the end of the month: Move into bitcoin.
You will end up having 3-5 bitcoin three years from now, which should be really nice given that you had almost zero risk with that investment.

Yea it's waiting for confirmations.
When you initiate the transaction, you broadcast your intent to move some money into the so called "mempool". There are thousands of transactions in there.
Every 10 minutes a few of those transactions will be "put into a block" and they will be "confirmed".
So as soon as some miner puts your transaction into a block, you will see 1 confirmation there. After 6 confirmations (1 hr) it is considered super save and truly irreversible, but you can theoretically already spend the coins after just 1 confirmation.
So how do miners decide which of the thousands of transaction to put into the next block? That's where fees come into play. Coinbase attaches quite a hefty fee to each transaction (so when you withdraw your BTC from Coinbase, you actually receive a little less than you had before because you paid a fee). The miners pick those transactions first that have the highest fees.
Very often you don't really care how fast your transaction moves. Let's say you had a beer with a friend and want to repay them, it doesn't matter if the money arrives after 10 minutes or 10 hours. Unlike Coinbase, Electrum allows you to set your fee manually and you can chose a really low fee if you want, but that means it might take much longer for your transaction to confirm.
This website is awesome to see the current size and fees in the mempool:

I guess I would transfer my own coins out of that address and into an exchange, then back into a new address of mine. That should be reasonable enough obfuscation - the fucker wouldn’t know your new address any more.
Then wait it out. If the authorities ever knock at your door, just give them the key to that old address and say you want nothing to do with it.

Giving up my data sucks, of course, but that was a small price to pay for the chance to get into bitcoin early.

No, it's a fork, where everyone who owned BTC before the fork now owns the same amount of SHIT after the fork.
If the security and privacy risk doesn't concern you, you may then try to send SHIT to a shady exchange and sell it for BTC, therefore earning seemingly "free" BTC.

* Several domain names
* On and off, a VPN account when I needed one (before I got the ProtonVPN)
* A book in Berlin, four years ago
I will continue to buy with bitcoin whenever it is offered, especially for online payments. I have a stash of bitcoin that is separate from my hodle stash that I would spend mindlessly, I'm paying into that stash monthly, just like I pay into my hodl stash weekly.

Get two Cryptosteel and put them into two locations far apart from each other (ideally two different countries).

To this very day, he has never witnessed any bitcoin transaction happening at any physical store in public and not a single person at his work place (BAYER AG) owns bitcoins, most older people don’t even know about it, no one ever really talks about it.
I’m still very bullish because of Japan, but when you just read this sub, it seems we are getting a slightly wrong picture here.

Most exchanges and cryptowatch show the price right there in the browser tab title. So just open that tab, you don't need to actually look at that tab.

When you change the PoW, you create an alt-coin as well. People will be very shocked, scared and confused. They will pull their money out of crypto and observe how the new coin with new PoW will compete against the Segwit2X coin that has no developers. We would be in a year long bear market.

Twitter engineers have a decade long history of not implementing what the platform needs the most, especially if it's a trivial change that needs like 20 lines of code.
Now, fighting this crypto scam bot infestation is probably not exactly a trivial change, but a company with Twitter's resources should be able to fix it in a month or two anyways.
It's really NOT HARD at all to identify these bot accounts. Twitter just doesn't care.

I was JUST wondering today:
Back in the days, five or six years ago, threads about Trezor and Cryptosteel and all these things where on the frontpage here DAILY. Everyone was asking how to secure the coins.
Today: Nothing. I can think of two explanations:
1. The community didn't actually grow that much and everyone has their secure storage in place by now.
2. There are good articles at key entry points for beginners (websites, blogs, wikis, youtube) and beginners don't seem to need any help - although I find this extremely unlikely.

@_date: 2017-09-03 03:31:28
In a Trezor wallet, they show Segwit addresses as your default and show the old ones as "Legacy Accounts". You just have to send your entire balance into a Segwit address and you are good to go.

Don't shop. Keep buying the same dollar amount every week for the next five years, whatever you can afford.
Ignore the price, it will go up, it will go down. Just zoom out, set the chart to weekly candles and chill.
Don't tell anyone you are into bitcoin.
Once you have bought $1000 worth of BTC, buy a Trezor and two Cryptosteel and move all your coins out of the marketplaces/wallets where you bought them and into the Trezor.

There is one flaw in your logic: If people woke up and decided to ignore the government, the government will send the military and give you a not so gentle reminder on who has the power and who has not.
You would think that "the military" is also just "the people", but usually, they are the most brainwashed, so they "wake up" last.

We are already living in so insanely inflated times, 1mio is no longer a desirable amount of money. In China, a new billionaire is made every two days.
Being “a millionaire” today means nothing. If you are smart, you keep on living exactly as you do right now and use that million as your pension fund. If you survive another 20 years, travel the world, drink expensive whisky and pay an exponentially growing amount of healthcare bills, that million *might* last until you die, if you are lucky and if you die soon enough.
To answer your question: Bitcoin will produce significantly less than 21mio new millionaires. This will be on the expense of a few billion poorly educated people who did not manage to convert their savings into fiat fast enough. Their savings will become worthless over the course of a few weeks when hyperbitcoinization kicks in. Our current millionaires will be fine (around 30 million millionaires at the moment, I think?) - I don’t think they even have any meaningful amount of wealth in cash, so on paper, they will be just as wealthy as before and we will add those “less than 21mio” new millionaires to the list.
So we will have around 40 million millionaires. Business as usual.

You plug in a USB stick, the offline system creates the signed transaction, which is really just a text-file, you copy that text file into the USB stick, then import that transaction on your virus-infested-online-computer that runs Electrum and let Electrum broadcast the transaction into the intertubes.

I think your idea of "adoption" is a bit too narrow.
Last week my bank closed both my personal and my business accounts because I regularly buy bitcoin.
Laws are constantly tightening to make transactions with large cash bank notes illegal.
In many countries, taxes for gifting money to even your closest relatives are absolutely insane.
Doing a wire transfer for a small sum like $10,000 which is a ridiculously small and unsubstantial amount for most people in the developed world (i.e. it doesn't even buy you a good car, for instance), money that you have earned, that you paid taxes on, that should be truly yours to command over - will trigger all kinds of AML alarms and banksters actually gave me phone calls to interrogate me about such transactions.
I have experienced ALL these issues in the past three years. And I'm far from being a rich person, but my hard earned cash is de-facto worthless. I know that some motherfucker at the government could make a decision and I would wake up tomorrow and be completely helpless, no access to my money, not able to move, commute, eat, transact, do business, survive. Just like that.
If I had enough bitcoins, none of these things would be of any concern to me. I can send money to anyone anywhere anytime, no matter the amount. I can walk into any sufficiently developed city, find a 2-way bitcoin ATM and draw some cash and survive for the day. I can offer my services anytime anywhere online and receive money for example just for using my graphics design skills or programmig skills. If it wasn't for bitcoin, I would be terrified about the state of the world right now. But I'm not. Bitcoin gives me complete financial indipendence and it gives me this right now, today. That's all you need as a usecase. The barrier of entry is tiny. The more the global situation worsens, he more people will buy in a little bit, just in case, as a little insurance. As a result, the price will go up significantly, as a result, all the people who got in early will be so rich that they don't care about HODLing any more. And they will start spending. And there will be people eager to offer their services.
It's inevitable. You will see.

A transaction is really just a bunch of text.
For example:
SEND 1BTC FROM ADDRESS-A TO ADDRESS-B
Usually, you will have your BTC as thousands of little amounts in thousands of different addresses in your wallet. So if you wanted to send 10kBTC, the text would become something like this;
SEND 1000BTC FROM ADDRESS-A AND 5000BTC FROM ADDRESS-B AND 4000BTC FROM ADDRESS-C TO ADDRESS-D
As you can see, that is much more text. As you know, any text file on your computer takes up some space. Short text like above is just a few bytes. But it takes space. That's the size of the transaction. we only have around 2MB or so space in each block.

Because 1. Coinbase is run by a technically illiterate evil CEO who is currently colluding with other banksters to destroy bitcoin. You shouldn’t give them any business.
and 2. because every exchange out there will eventually get hacked or shut down by the government - leaving your coins lying around there is “counterparty risk” - you don’t truly own your coins until you transfer them into a wallet where you control the keys.

8.5 million. That's like one small *city* somewhere in rural China and they have hundreds of those cities and there are hundres more countries with thousands more cities... or in other words: there are more than one fucking billion Android devices and no end in sight and I guess their endgame is to have a chip in every device on the planet, including your fridge, your toaster and your self consci.. I mean self driving electric car.
Their chips would probably become better with each iteration as well and since most people throw away their phones every two years, I'm quite sure that if they reach their end game, they will have by far the biggest mining pool on the planet.

I agree to your concerns, which are certainly valid. That makes it all the more exciting to see how this episode in Bitcoinland will turn out in the end.

I just have a hunch that 21 is up to something and that their whole business model is derived from first principles (math and physics) and that their math will check out in the end.

Every other asset out there can be inflated in supply and is therefore a bad store of value. Bitcoin is the only asset ever known to man that has a fixed supply. It is therefore the best store of value mankind has ever known. 
You can bitch about it as much as you like - people have always naturally put their money into the best store of value that they could find and people will therefore naturally eventually put their money into bitcoin. Intrinsic value has absolutely nothing to do with this discussion.

They won't. I'm always happy when someone creates a thread in this sub about this problem and I have even asked this question myself in the past, several times, but I have never gotten a good answer to this.
I'm buying coins every week for three years now and to this very day, I have not found a good solution to this problem. I don't want to trust some notary or bank. I don't want to create some elaborate treasure-hunt that involves three friends on three different continents - hoping that they are all still alive and didn't succumb to dementia or something... I don't want to carve stuff into some kind of stainless steel kryptonite that can withstand 10000 degrees celsius before it melts and then pay money for a bank deposit box (they are the bad ones, right? I'm not supposed to use a bank vault, right? That would be pure irony, right?).

It’s when some idiot creates a fork of bitcoin. Then you have, let’s say 10BTC and another 10 of the new coin. Everyone then exchanges the new coin for BTC, so it feels like you got free money.

At $100,000 new users will be forced to come in no matter if they like it or not.
$100,000 would be a sign of mass adoption and therefore most shops would prefer to receive bitcoin and in most situations it would be more convenient to pay with bitcoin.
Also, at $100,000 you still have a chance to go all in and wait for it to reach $1,000,000 and 10x your money.

I'll bite.
* If you don't provide enough fee, your transaction will be stuck in limbo for days and eventually not be completed. Furthermore, if you don't wait for a confirmation, the sender can attempt a double spend attack.
* Nothing is unhackable. And nothing is 100% secure, and never will be. Someone can accidentally guess your key out of sheer luck, in theory. A government or thief can and will torture you to get to the key, which is MUCH easier than to get to the money that is in your bank. Truly securing the key is so fantastically difficult, if you are up against a very strong adversary, I can guarantee you that, unless you have been a true cypherpunk for the last 20 years and maybe even worked for a three letter agency, your very own bitcoins are not safe right now. Lets go look at any of those threads where people discuss how to best secure coins. In 6 years, I have never ever seen an answer that is actually good.
* Downtime is not impossible. But yeah, very unlikely. However, unless we live in a post-fiat world, we all rely on exchanges, and they are down all the fucking time.

It's a digital token with a billion dollars in hardware investments sitting in the physical world, securing it, with further billions of dollars spent on electricity costs.
Besides, your argument is pointless. What do you think any fiat currency is? You think for the trillions of dollars that exists, there is a paper bill backing it up? Fiat money is a digital token as well.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:48:21
The world's products are only priced in fiat because the government forces you by law to use fiat as the legal tender.
People would NOT USE IT if they had a choice. That is the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place. It exists outside of the reach of the government and finally gives people a choice again.

OK so this is the second thread about "dust" on the frontpage but the first time I have ever heard the term during my three years here...
What's with this "bitcoin is infinitely divisible" idea? Whats the point in buying very small amounts when I can't transfer them anywhere due to fees?
I'm using Electrum and so far I have always only send coins into the same address. How can I check if there us "dust" and how can I avoid collecting dust?

Alts have absolutely nothing to with this discussion. We were talking about the bitcoin price here. There is only one bitcoin and there will always be only one bitcoin. All of your alts are worthless scams and will eventually drop back to a value close to or equal to zero.
Paper money has no intrinsic value. Seashells had no intrinsic value. All those forms of money that were used by primitive tribes had no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is not a property that the medium of exchange needs to have. All it needs is 1) to be hard to acquire and hard to inflate, 2) to be easily divisible into smaller units and 3) to be easily carried around across space.

A rising price is a prerequisite to make something a desirable store of value. And in a world that does not have any kind of sound money any more, a store of value is something that every person on the planet desperately wants. This alone will cause mass adoption, as in: every person on earth will earn a fraction of a bitcoin, simply to store long term wealth.
Once the market is saturated, the price will not rise as violently any more and then we can start using it as a medium of exchange.

This is true, but memorizing the seed is extremely difficult.
Also: I have to type in a password when signing transactions so that Electrum can decrypt the private keys and create the transaction. This is something you should not do on a compromised machine - and I assume that EVERY machine that had access to the internet is compromised.

Yep. I decided what amount of money I could flush down the toilet every week without impacting my life in any way and then started to buy that amount every Sunday.
I started doing this when the price was just going to the moon because of Mt.Gox. So for quite a while I bought at insane prices. Then the price crashed down hard and I WAS HAPPY about it because now I would get a lot more BTC for each transaction.
Now I'm waiting for the moment when I can buy my cappuccinos with BTC at at least two or three cafes near my office. I would take that as a signal that mainstream adoption is around the corner and then I need to come up with a sound plan on how transfer a lot more of my liquid assets into bitcoin without exposing myself to too much risk because of volatility. Probably something like: For each cappuccino bought (or any other item), I reload twice the amount back into my BTC wallet that same day. Or: I usually have some money left at the end of each month that I put into a savings account. I could put half of it (or more) into BTC instead.
After that I'll wait for the moment where I can buy a plane ticket, fly to another country, rent a hotel and take a taxi and do this all with BTC only. At that stage I'd assume that the market cap is so high that there will be no more crazy price swings and I'd put my whole salary into BTC every month and live off that only. I'd also gradually transfer my fiat savings into BTC.
That's probably a very very slow and risk averse strategy and when I'm 70 years old I will hate myself for not simply buying 100 BTC right now. But then again - I think I started all this early enough. If one BTC will ever reach 100,000 USD, I'll be very happy.

My biggest issue is security.
Everyone says "just print a paper wallet and put it into a safe" but to me that's a load of bullshit. If you do a little bit of research you will quickly find out that there are a million caveats:
* ink might fade
* paper might disintegrate
* printer might secretly store a log of everything it prints or even phone home
* you have to pay for a safe somewhere
* you have to trust that organisation (let me guess, it's gonna be a bank? be your own bank, they say. put your stuff into a bank safe they say. contradicting much?)
I have never ever in my life put anything into a safe. Bitcoin will be the most useful for very very mobile people (think digital nomad). Having something locked up in a safe will never be an option for me because I'll never know where on the globe I'll be at any given time.
So currently I have a RPi with a Logitech mini keyboard. This hardware will never be connected to the internet. I run Electrum on that machine.
* it's small and portable
* if the hardware fails, I'll just buy a new one and set it up again, thanks to the mnemonic phase I'll get back all my keys
* I still need to remember the 12 word mnemonic phrase
In the end, it seems that there will always be something complex that we must not forget. As a result I have uploaded a truecrypt folder into a cloud provider like dropbox. That truecrypt container contains a textfile with my menmonic phrase.
OBVIOUSLY the password to that truecrypt container is something that I can remember. 
And obviously, this is the weak spot in my defenses. If anyone gains access to that truecrypt container, they only need to bruteforce that password and then they will have access to my bitcoins.
This seems to be a general problem with crypto. Crypto only works because we are juggling super long keys so that no one will ever be able to bruteforce then. But in order to move our keys around we encrypt them again, usually using a much weaker password.
I COULD, of course, make sure that this final password which is my last line of defense, is also really really long so that no one can brute force it, but then I am prone to forget it. How do I not forget it? I use it for many things (i.e. login screen of my MacBook). Those everyday things are obviously all connected to the internet and therefore, typing in that password often would mean that I could fall victim to a keylogger (or really just a thief sitting behind me at Starbucks).
After writing all this, I guess one way to solve the problem is to make the password of the truecrypt container super difficult and then use my offline RPi once a week and try to decrypt the container, for the sole purpose of memorizing the password and always keeping the memory fresh. Sounds like a pain in the ass to me.

I have a question that you might be able to answer: As a German, I have to pay tax on my "world income", so anything that I earn anywhere in the world.
EXCEPT when I live abroad for more than half a year, then my income in THAT year MAY be taxed under the foreign countries laws, if that country has a double-taxation-treaty with Germany.
For normal salary income this is pretty straightforward, but now I am wondering what happens to capital gains. Say I bought stock/gold/bitcoin five years ago when I still lived in Germany, but now I have been living in Singapore for a few years and I want to cash out. Singapore has 0% capital gains tax, so does it mean that I could cash out and not pay a single cent?

@_date: 2017-05-30 04:44:56
I think you understand why the value can only go up over a long enough time frame - because it is a deflationary currency. 
I believe, what you are actually asking for (and what all answer so far seem to ignore) is why the price is so extremely volatile.
I can think of the following:
1. The market cap at the moment is so small, any high net worth individual or institutional investor can take a few million dollars and create a huge splash in the market. Same happens when some script kiddie that mined 5000 coins on their GPU seven years ago cashes out and retreats to the Bahamas.
2. Media, sock puppet/troll accounts, and hype. If you are a large institutional investor (or, for example, a Chinese government official) and if you have sufficient control over the media (simply owning bitcoin.com and posting news that drive your hidden agenda is priceless), you can create hype just like that. The community is so small and it communicates on just a few places on the internet, if you want to push a certain agenda you can just thrown few thousand dollars at it and create whatever narrative fits your goal. Very few people have the technical expertise to validate *any* of the claims that you can read here or on "the other sub" or in a news article, so you can write pretty much whatever the fuck you want and thousands of people will suddenly get FOMO and start asking their "nerd friends" how to buy a few coins, quickly. Once such a fabricated bull run loses steam, you cash out, which crashes the price and then you use the media to create FUD, so even more people cash out and the price corrects drastically, until only those people are left who truly understand the technology and don't give a damn about the price. And then you repeat. By the very nature of bitcoin, most people invested into it are "digital natives", we are glued to our screens and it makes us extremely vulnerable to getting brainwashed by online media campaigns. Few other assets allow for such cheap and easy mass manipulation.
3. Actual innovation, geopolitical events. Sometimes, actual innovation happens. If we can activate SegWit on August 1st, for example, I wouldn't be surprised if the price tenfolds in just a week. Of course it will eventually crash down half of the gain, like it *always* does, shaking out weak hands and greedy people. Likewise, Japan just announced that Bitcoin will become normal legal tender in Summer, suddenly you have 127 million people getting exposed to it over night.
4. The halvening. Every four years the mining-reward is cut in half. This usually creates a period of hype and uncertainty and therefore creates crazy price fluctuations. Experienced people will know that nothing is supposed to happen at the moment of the halvening because the lower block reward has already been priced in during the four years leading up to it, but many people are naive and think "oh, so if miners suddenly earn half as much, but have the same electricity cost, surely the price has to double", which is total bullshit, of course, but it's an easy narrative to spin, so some people pump it and then cash out.
5. Alt coins. We get like one new alt-coin every week, most of them are scams, but some really try to threaten bitcoin by doing one thing better than bitcoin. The inventors usually pump it up, people get scared: "what if this coin takes over bitcoin and I miss my chance to convert all my BTC into ETH and I end up losing everything? Better buy some ETH now" - this creates FUD and FOMO at the same time, people do what they always do: they freak out, et voila, you got massive price swings again.
@_date: 2015-03-09 02:25:08
Correct, but the same is true for a paper wallet. Leaves me with the same problems as stated in my initial post.

Yea but with Patreon I quickly get into the situation that "I already paid for enough stuff this month" and I usually can't even remember how many Patreon projects I'm alrady paying each month, which makes me even more reluctant to quickly pay for yet another one.
Flattr is just better. Because it is so easy to integrate, the main hypothesis probably is that people who were merely consumers at first will also start attaching flattr buttons to their own content (whatever that might be) and thus start earning a small passive income, which in turn will make them even more grateful for the whole system and more willing to up their monthly tipping budget.
The only real problem is gaining a critical mass of users.
It has become pretty big in Germany at some point and a few of Germany's best bloggers / podcasters manages to earn a consistent monthly income that was big enough to quit all other jobs and do their thing full time.
And with flattr ot doesn't really feel like tipping any more. It's more like a like-button. You can just click it and you don't have to worry about the money.

Yea I didn't push them. I said: You decide how much money you can flush down the toilet every week without affecting your lifestyle at all - because this might all go down in a fire and we might lose everything, so chose an amount that is so low that you won't have any regrets afterwards.
And that's what we did. Now we all have regrets that we didn't put in more, LOL.

That's a pretty wild theory.

This sub has taught me that reddit is a cesspool full of sockpuppet accounts.
I also got some helpful responses on how to prepare for the upcoming split.
I learned about Electrum and then Trezor and Cryptosteel here on this sub.
I learned about the names of some of the core developers (and highly value it when they take time to post here).
I also learned about the names of some people who are hurting the ecosystem.
I have no idea if I'm getting brainwashed by the wrong bubble or not, but my investment is up 390% and at this rate, about six years from now I will be set for life. Also, my understanding of the protocol as a software developer of 20+ years in the industry tells me that this is the right sub, but when you read the other sub for a while, you really don't know what is real any more. I guess most of all, this sub has taught me, that the human race needs a web 3.0 where brainwashing through bot accounts is no longer possible.

Because they re running their miners with ASICBOOST and are potentially earning $100mio per year more than usual. SegWit would prevent them from doing that.
As a greedy human individual, you don't give a fuck about a technology that could make the world a better place for generations to come if you have the option to delay is just a couple more years and make hundreds of millions extra.
You could just as well ask why the hell there are climate change deniers existing on this planet. It's the same thing.

I do think, though, that bitcoin is inherently anti-consumerism - and I consider that a *good* thing because what we are collectively doing to the planet right now is simply not sustainable.
Personally, I will refrain from spending bitcoin as long as fiat is still worth something. I would never buy clothes with bitcoin because clothes usually don't last very long. If I would ever buy anything with bitcoin, it would be something that lasts and (even better) appreciates in value or ads to my personal freedom (like art, some land, or a house).

Your wallet is just a list of addresses. Those  addresses are just cryptographic keypairs (private key and public key).
The seed is just a super long string that is easy to type in for a human without making mistakes. It could just as well be a super long string of random characters and numbers.
The seed will be put into an algorithm and that algorithm will start spitting out addresses (keypairs) based on that seed.
The algorithm is built in such a way that it always returns the exact same addresses in the exact same order when given the same seed.
So when you install the software for the first time and enter the seed it will generate a few addresses based on the seed. 
When you install the software again on another machine and enter the exact same seed, the software will generate the exact same addresses again.
The seed doesn't need to communicate with any server. It's all just math.

The advice that I took was to get all my coins into a wallet where I control the keys. So I moved everything into my Trezor. I will wait it out after the split. By the time a clear winner emerges, it will be too late to dump my remaining "loser-coins" for the winner coins and not be worth the effort.

Not bitcoin related but flattr.com solved this problem of "tipping people for their content" about 5 or 6 years ago.
As a user you can upload any amount of money into your account (say $10) and then just click at flattr buttons all over the net whenever you consume something that you like. The cool thing is, your 10$ will be split among all things that you flattered.
So you can decide for yourself how much your "social flatrate" will cost you.
They never really got mainstream and I don't know why, probably because they are not a US startup and don't have big VC funding.
I still think this is by far the best way to pay for content on the net, even better than showing bitcoin QRcodes next to your content because you don't even have to think about the amount you would like to give.

The miners have to sell their coins because they have to pay for electricity. There will always be circulation, no matter how little.

I don't know. Creating ASICBOOST is not against the law. Once you have let that ghost out of the bottle and you realise that you could make 100mio in one year just by stalling bitcoin innovation, you would totally do that. What is one year in the grand scheme of things? It's peanuts. And it's not even illegal. You will tell yourself, if the ecosystem can't cope with someone like me, it was always bound to fail anyways, if I don't do this, someone else will attempt this. And 100 mio for yourself, that's stupid amounts of money. You, your family and you children will never have to work again.

I think right now it's just Goldman Sachs riding it up and down and milking it as long as they can.
And as long as we haven't avoided the looming hardfork to 8MB / B-ABC, I think the price will just randomly go up and down like crazy.

I would really like to see some investigative journalism and learn *exactly* how this entire ecosystem works. How do you contact these people. What do they offer. How much does it cost. How do you pay. How do you control the messages they are supposed to spam out?
As a society, we must understand how this shit works so that some bright mind can go ahead and build counter-measures against it.
The likes of Digg and Reddit were all nice and all five years ago when bots were too stupid to overcome a simple Captcha, but today we are in a completely different situation, Reddit has largely become useless for the un-initiated.
We need a Web 3.0 and it needs to be 100% decentralized, 100% encrypted and have some strong features to prove your humanity and your unique identity - without losing all your privacy.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:23:40
I think people immediately understand when you tell them they can buy fractions.
But then an even bigger problem gets on their minds: How could it possibly rise any higher when it is already so valuable. You can tell them that one coin might be worth 50k. If they got in at 3k and bought 1k, it would be worth 16k in maybe 5 years? Most people would somehow dismiss that as a not so spectacular investment ("doesn't make me a millionaire after all, I'm too late already").
Now you have to tell them about how the Federal Reserve Bank and the World Bank works and how a global economic collapse will render the dollar worthless and THAT should be the reason why you would want to transform all your current fiat into crypto so you are prepared when the economipocalypse happens. But that's not exactly an elevator pitch.

It produces something very profound: The chance of financial freedom for everyone on earth. You need to learn a lot about how the Federal Bank System works and you need to understand that no matter how much money you have in your bank account, if you piss off the wrong person (or government), your funds will be frozen and you are in deep ship, immediately.
Bitcoin also makes banks as we know them obsolete. If you compare the energy wasted on Bitcoin with the energy wasted in all those massive bank towers, and their server centers, and their vaults, and their security firms, and their money trucks, Bitcoin is actually better for the environment.
Since Bitcoin is all about getting energy as cheaply as possible, it will also trigger an arms race for discovering the best and cleanest sources of energy. It will probably create a huge demand for solar cells, which will turn out to be good for the environment. Besides, we can create energy quite cleanly these days. What kills the planet is not the creation of energy, it's the reckless exploitation of our natural resources and the massive over-production of goods that no one needs and that then pollute our environment.
Bitcoin solves that problem as well: It is deflationary, so in the long run, the price can only go up. If you can spend 0.001 BTC on a pair of Nike shoes today, you will not do it, because you know that you can get an entire vacation trip for the same price, in three years. You would rather save your hard earned bitcoins. You will only buy things that last very long (like very good leather shoes, made to measure), that appreciate in value (like art) or that are truly important to you (like an unforgettable trip to Iceland, or a life saving operation).

I have my salary in fiat. I have 2 month's salaries in fiat on my savings account. This is for unexpected expenses, i.e. a sudden health care bill. 
Things that I am saving for, that I need in less than 1yr (like a plane tickets back home for this Christmas) are also in fiat, because I don't ever want to pay capital gains tax, so all my coins always rot for &gt;1yr before they get used.
Everything else that was fiat before is in bitcoin now. 
However, that's far from 90% of my wealth, because my house will be by far my most expensive asset for quite some time and I have been an entrepreneur for the past eight years, so my real wealth is locked up in my businesses.
If I were to cash out of one of my businesses and suddenly had 6-figures to spend, I really don't know what I would do. My wife would want to upgrade to a nicer condo (which will cost 1.8mio+) and we could earn about S$3000 / month rent from our current place, but I guess it would be smarter to put everything into BTC and wait 4 years for it to double and THEN buy a bigger condo.

If the market would follow the best code, no shitcoin would have any value, and yet, hundreds of shitcoins are soaring.

You are not supposed to make sense of what he says, because it actually makes no sense. He is a figure that was planted by whoever, just like Donald Trump. Every time he opens his mouth, some unbelievable bullshit drops out and it has several effects:
1. It binds the time of experts, because they have to read it, try to interpret it, and then publicly debunk it. This time is then forever lost, the experts were prevented to work on what really matters.
2. It opinionates gullible people who don't have technical expertise and don't know who to trust. These people will then move on and repeat the bullshit they have heard, binding even more time of the experts because now they have to reply to all these idiots as well, because if you don't counter them, less gullible people with equally low technical knowledge will start to believe that what they see everywhere repeated on social media and so on is the predominant opinion.
3. It frustrates the experts, drives them crazy, pushes them to give up. Imagine, you just want to write AAA code for the most important innovation of mankind since the invention of the Gutenberg press. You wake up in the morning and check Twitter and Reddit and another shitstorm broke loose. You know you have to fight it, so you lose an entire day with debunking obvious bullshit. What we often don't see are personal insults or even physical threats that the experts will then receive from troll and sock puppet accounts. Even if you KNOW for a fact that these are all not real people, it gets to you, no one has such a thick skin. 
tl;dr: Craig Wright has been planted to be the Donald Trump of Bitcoin. You cannot make sense of his words, his only purpose is to utter nonsensical bullshit to bind productive energy of people who want bitcoin to succeed.

Bitcoin is like a database, think of it like a giant Excel spreadsheet. Now this special database is not only saved on your computer. It's saved on millions of computers. That's what we call "decentralised". 
Now, you would try to be a smart ass and just open your version of the file and increase your balance by one million bitcoins, because you always wanted to be really rich.
The cool thing about Bitcoin is, the network will reject your version of that spreadsheet, it will say "No man, in our version, you are not a millionaire!".
You will say "But I really am, I didn't cheat, I swear!"
The the network will say "Sure, man, prove it".
In order to convince the network that your version of the file is the truth, you need to get your computer to solve those math problems. They are only there to make you waste energy, the results are not meaningful in any way, it's really just about wasting energy, because energy is precious and expensive. So if you want to cheat and make your version the truth, you need more than 51% of the global haspower and you need that for an extended amount of time, so it would be really, really, *really* expensive to buy so many computers just to cheat and it would also be extremely obvious that your are trying to cheat.
So we are solving math problems in order to waste energy, and we need to waste energy in order to make it astronomically expensive for anyone to try to write untrue transactions into the database.

Yes, for my goals, it is the best in space.
My goals are: A decentralized, immutable, deflationary store of value that has a large ecosystem (wallets, hardware wallets, exchanges, plugins for online payment processors), is 100% open source and is being peer reviewed by many and good developers and members of the scientific community.
Bitcoin meets all of these requirements. It would be awesome if it was more anonymous, but I think it is too early for that. Governments would freak out and kill it immediately.
It would also be awesome if it would allow for microtransactions (and that needs lower fees &amp; more throughput), but all known trivial solutions for this problem (such as increasing the block size) go against the first three goals. Second layer technologies are attacking this problem now and I think this is the only way to move forward in the scaling debate without sacrificing the first three goals.
I value the first three goals above all, because I am convinced that sooner or later a global economic collapse will happen and trigger hyperinflation for all known fiat currencies. A decentralized, immutable and deflationary public ledger is my hedge against that possible future.
We got this far because of uncontrolled greed by central banks and we have exploited and wrecked the planet in the process. This is all nice and cool for us privileged people in the first world, but globally, this is not sustainable for much longer, so maybe a Bitcoin with those first three attributes is a good alternative way of running the world.

Do DCA (dollar cost averaging).
Decide how much money you can flush down the toilet every week without affecting your lifestyle, then invest that amount every Sunday, ie $20 every Sunday.
Doesn't matter what the BTC price is, you just buy $20 without thinking. If BTC is high, you are happy because your investment is worth a lot more. If BTC is low, you are happy because you can accumulate more with your $20.
Do this for a few months. At some point you will have invested $1000 or the price skyrocketed and your investment is worth $1000. Now is a good time to use your BTC (or better your fiat, actually) to order a Trezor hardware wallet and two Cryptosteel. Slot your Trezor seed into the Cryptosteels, and hide both Cryptosteels at very secure locations, ideally in two different countries (I'm doing three different continents). Then transfer all your funds out of the exchange and into your Trezor. 
From now on, whenever you buy more, immediately transfer it into your Trezor, never leave stuff lying around on exchanges. People here say "Not your keys, not your coins" all the time for good reasons.
After 6-12 months, you should understand BTC very well. Read the whitepaper. Learn how the blockchain works. Learn how mining works (don't attempt to do mining). Learn about fiat money vs sound money. Read "The Bitcoin Standard". Learn about how to secure your coins. Learn about how to pass on your coins in case you die (very difficult, largely unsolved problem with no good mainstream best practices or tools in place).
At this stage, you will understand that owning bitcoin is not a risky investment, but having too much of your net worth in fiat is. For practical reasons you should always have three months salaries worth of fiat in your bank, but anything on top of that should be invested elsewhere, for example bitcoin (but really any kind of investment would do, never leave money rotting around in bank accounts).
So you might decide to either increase your weekly DCA amount or to keep doing DCA but at the end of each month any money that you earned and didn't waste, will be dumped right into BTC as well. At this stage, you will be protected in case hyperbitcoinisation ever happens, because you have made sure that most of your net worth is transferred right into bitcoin.
The good thing about all this is: There is basically zero risk for you. Even if you do this for four years and then against all odds some genius comes up with some new tech that makes bitcoin obsolete and bitcoin goes to zero (almost impossible for this to happen, not only for technical reasons but also game theory, network effects and psychological reasons), all you would have lost is $20 per week, which you already decided would not affect you in any way.
The ONLY bad thing that can happen is that after six years you will have invested $6240 and it will be worth $100,000 and you will hate yourself for not putting in a lot more six years ago. BUT DO NOT DO THIS.
This entire shtick only works because at all times you are putting in money that you don't really need. If you put in $20,000 today, sure, your potential gains in 6 years might be astronomical, but you will need balls of steel to sweat through the crazy market movements and what if you suddenly fall sick and need that money to save your life but you can't cash out because we are currently in a bear market? You will suffer a giant loss. DO NOT INVEST ANYTHING YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE, no matter how sure you are that bitcoin will rule the world in 15 years. It most likely will, but your own life circumstances WILL NOT go as planned in such a long timeframe.
Also: If you DCA small amounts for just 3 years, you will likely experience 10x gains. Then you can cash out 10-15% and basically get your entire investment back. From now on you are in an amazing psychological position: No matter how much bitcoin crashes and how many of your colleagues give you smug comments like "eh, btc not looking so good huh!", you know that you have not a single cent to lose because you already got back your initial investment and more.
When you survive your second bear market (8 years from now), you will look at 100x gains and NOW you can cash out $40-60k (which is again just 10-15% of your holdings). Suddenly you have some fuck you money that you can gamble with extremely high risk. This will be your once in a lifetime chance to attempt to sell at the top, wait for the 80% crash and buy back at the bottom. If it works, you doubled your holdings, if it didn't you lost 2-8% of your holdings but that's OK (at least you got the money that you cashed out).
 tl;dr: do DCA, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, don't expect to cash out in the next 8-10 years. Get rich quick times with BTC are long gone.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:37:00
The main difference is that BTC has a major event every four years baked into the protocol. Would gold have something similar? 
With gold I would think it should actually be the reverse, every four years the theoretically mine-able amount of gold should increase as mining technology gets better and better and we get better and better at finding new gold sources.

You named Biccamera in Japan, the one shop that everyone on this sub knows because it was reported in all the blog spam here over and over again. So one shop accepts BTC.

Durability doesn't really matter. You will never find hardware that will last you a lifetime, so these are throw-away goods by definition. You might even want to upgrade to better versions every couple of years, just like people like to upgrade their smartphones.
If the devices breaks or gets lost, you just buy a new one (or install a compatible software wallet) and recover from your 24 word seed. 
The only thing you really need to worry about is storing that seed on paper at several safe locations.

I guess there will an extremely huge global incentive to go all into renewable energy and provide every single human's power-needs with self sustaining solar power equipment (like those huge batteries Tesla is building). That way, the general population will not suffer from high electricity cost, because they simply make their own electricity.
Nation states, or what is left of them, would funnel all their other massive power sources into mining pools for securing the network and essentially be forever bound to a cold war / arms race to not lose too much hashing power. They will do this because that will essentially be the only way left to "collect taxes". By mining coins (or later just collecting block rewards) they get their hands on some funds with which they maintain their infrastructure, pay government workers, give out funding for startups etc.
Just some random thoughts while on the train.

There might even be ways to install Ubuntu on a bootable USB stick, if you don't want to dualboot your computer.

I think the fiat value of bitcoin will go up, but that will be meaningless because fiat will get into a hyperinflation and be essentially worthless.
Our entire global economy is essentially built on the Federal Reserve System, which just prints money out of nowhere and then loans it to entities that are too big to fail, then these entities can't pay their interest, they would fail, but they get bailed out by the government. Inflation goes up by 2% and the money that has been printed out of thin air will thus be taken back from the general population. The loans however, are still outstanding, they will just be rolled over and extended and whatnot, so the failing entity is still failing and the cycle will forever repeat.
This, pretty obviously, cannot continue infinitely. We are creating money out of thin air, so that we can fund venutures that would otherwise not have been funded if the money supply would have been tighter. At some point the economy will collapse and we will realise that we have created tons and tons of businesses just because there were cheap loans and not because these businesses were viable or useful.
All these businesses will go out of business. Hundreds of thousands, or millions of people will lose their jobs.
Bitcoin will be the only useful currency left and the way how we put prices at goods will have to be reset. We will no longer think in terms of "one bread costs $5 and thats 0.00001 BTC" but we will think in terms of "one bread costs 0.0000000000000001 BTC today. full stop. there is no USD equivalent price any more".
Those people who have bitcoins now have the task to create new ventures and hire people and thus get their bitcoins into circulation. These ventures must be very useful, though, because no one of the general population would be so fucking crazy and pay a part of their tiny balance of 0.001 BTC for something stupid like a cable TV subscription or Netflix or whatever, because 0.0001 BTC will be their entire net worth because they got in too late during the hyperinflation phase.

I have no idea man. Yes. The price will drop hard, on both chains, but I wouldn't dare to buy "cheap coins" - how to decide on which chain?? THAT would be gambling, because if you bet on the wrong one, you lose everything. Whatever you buy now is yours, no matter what.
Once it becomes obvious which chain is going to win, I expect the price to shoot back up to what it is now so fast, you will likely miss the opportunity to buy in low. So you can just as well buy now.

NO ONE uses crypto here for anything.
Good friend of mine just came back to Germany after three years in Osaka. NO ONE in Japan uses crypto for anything either.
China? They are already addicted to Alipay. No one uses crypto in China.
Friend in Hong Kong? She wasn't able to figure out a safe and legal way to buy crypto to this very day due to legal uncertainty and fear of losing her bank account. I urged her to buy about two years ago already. After the price tanked, she lost interest, and why would she care: No one in Hong Kong uses crypto for anything.

Let's say I have 10 coins now. Let's say they will be worth 100k in 30 years. Thats $1mio.
Let's say I want to maintain my current standard of life and need $3000 / month. I'll survive 27 years on $1mio. That won't be true 30 years in the future, though, because the dollar will have lost most of today's buying power. No idea how much, so let's assume 50%. So I'll actually only survive 13 years.
I'll be 64 in 30 years, good time to retire, actually, but 13 years later I'll only be 78 - pretty good chance I'll still be alive AND I'll probably have a fuckton of medical bills every month and might still rot away for another 10 years if I'm unlucky.

If you don't have a physical replacement device, you can install a wallet software that is compatible with that kind of seed and just use that until you get a replacement device.
This is risky, though, as the computer you will use with that wallet software could be compromised, so that should be a deperate measure if you really really really can't wait until a replacement device ships.
We will soon live in a world where you can buy those devices at every 7/11, though, so don't worry about that.

When you want to sign a transaction with your software wallet, you need to enter a password to decrypt your private keys. If your computer is connected to the internet, you must assume that it is compromised and has trojans and keyloggers, listening to your inputs, taking screenshots of your screen and downloadig your wallet.dat file.
Therefore, when signing transactions with a software wallet, the only sane way is to do it with a computer that has never been connected to the internet, ever, and never will. So you could buy a RPi and and all the needed peripherals, like a small keyboard, SD card, a case, USB charging cable - and you will end up spending more than $100 for a Trezor, having a device that is quite ugly, wasting space lying around in your home. Bot to mention, signing transactions on that offline device and then exporting them to a USB stick and then importing them into another wallet of yours to broadcast them is just fucking annoying and too difficult to do for the average person.
A Trezor solves all of this.

I believe most of the hateful content that makes the internet unbearable today is ALREADY PAID FOR. Troll farms don't operate for free. The bad guys are already paying to produce content. The bad guys are also paying to plant ads and fake news.
I would guesstimate that 60-80%% of the worlds money is in fact controlled by bad guys already, there is no way that "us normal people" can outpay these bad actors.
You would have to drive up the prices a lot to make operations for trolls unfeasible but when you do that, you also drive away all good people.

@_date: 2017-06-21 16:38:30
Nobody really knows what would happen in a society where bitcoin is the world currency.
The good thing is, people will stop buying useless shit or shit that immediately loses all it's value (like cars) or shit that is designed to break after a year (like sneakers).
It would stop consumerism as we know it, and in extension, the reckless exploitation of our environment.
The bad thing is, no one would ever invest into anything that sounds slightly risky or even fantastical (like colonizing Mars, or curing cancer), so technological advancements would probably come to a total halt.

I think this is a big problem that no one really thinks about right now. It doesn't even have to be a robber. It's more likely the government putting you into a cell until you reveal all your coins.
In the simple robber scenario, though, Bill Gates would truthfully say "I don't carry my Trezor on me and I obviously don't know my seed by heart, but I have $5000 in my wallet on my Smartphone here, which I wanted to spend on a nice dinner, tonight, I can send you those $5000 and you have a nice dinner, instead"
For kidnapping and such situations, I really don't know. Bitcoin seems to be the best thing ever, handing over the the money has never been easier. The crooks just broadcast their address and when they get the money, maybe they are nice and don't kill the victim.
I guess we would end up in a world where we would have a long list of addresses that were funded because of crimes, that need to be observed on some kind of blacklist and if the funds ever move, the police needs to try to follow the money. I'm afraid, though, the technology to "wash" your coins will always be one step ahead of the technology to trace coins.
This thread has mostly shitty responses, but in a world where cryptocurrencies have killed fiat and the banking system, this is a gigantic problem for which I see no solution.
If you kill the government, the solution will simply be: Defend yourself, or die.

The common advice is: After August 1st, DONT transact at all until the situation is clear.
Therefore: Buy as much as can now, because after August 1st it can take days, weeks or months before it is clear which chain is safe to use. You might not be able to transact for weeks. You'll want to put your money in right now.

Every time someone accidentally says the word "mining", suddenly 10 people pop out of nowhere and eloquently suggest that mining is impossible because you would never make back your investment and you would be better off to just buy some BTC.
That is true, of course. 
But the point here is that I am my own bank, isn't it? That is worth A LOT to me. I already paid $99 x 3 for three Trezors and $50 for a Cryptosteel and I would gladly pay more $ for whatever it takes to setup a small miner or at least a full node somewhere in my house. Making money is entirely not the point, decentralization is the point.
If we truly believe that Bitcoin will usher in a new age of crypto anarchy with maximally empowered individuals and destroy nation states as we know them, who is going to provide our infrastructure? WE ARE.
And it's gonna cost us something.
I don't need an aircon in my house, but I pay electricity for it anyways, because I like it cool.
I don't need a miner in my house, but I would pay the electricity anyways, because I like my freedom.
Unfortunately I'm too stupid to do math and I don't have the relevant data at hand, so my question would be:
What if there was a $100 commodity hardware that would be fast enough for a year or so? What if that would suck up $100 in electricity cost per year? What if 100 million people would use that. I would lose $200 a year but if that the price to no longer be a slave of my government and in extension to banks, maybe that's a price worth paying?
Has someone done the math? Would that still be such a small amount of collective hash power that it won't make a difference at all in terms of decentralisation?

I think what would happen is, that pretty much all funding would take place via crowd sourcing. Surely, no one will invest 100mio into a risky venture, but maybe 100mio people would invest $1, even if they know that this dollar would be worth a bit more in the future.
Also: Right now, bitcoin basically tenfolds in value every two years or so... this will probably stop once everyone is on board. It will still go up in the very long run, but would you really hoard $1000 just because 60 years later it will be worth $2000? I wouldn't.

would it lead to a drop, though? I would think that most people will HODL and wait it out, so supply will suddenly be extremely limited. at the same time, though, demand will probably be equally limited because investors will really want to know first which chain will survive, so maybe nothing will happen.

When recovering, you have to type in the seed words, but Trezor will ask you for the different words in a random order.
If your computer is infested with a keylogger, the hacker will know the words of your seed, but not the correct order. They could now try to brute force every possible solution, but even if they would use the processing power of the entire bitcoin network, it would still take them more than three years. If they have less than that, it will take them hundreds or thousands of years.

As Russian hackers get even better at meddling with elections or Roger Ver with brainwashing the internet with his propaganda, we will no longer be able to decide which account (and opinion) is real and which is bought or scripted.
We will no longer know which product review on Amazon is real. We will no longer know which movie review on IMDB is real.

Singapore is a tax haven. It's a tiny city state that is desperate for outside talent and investment money to further develop the country.
For Germany, I'm actually quite amazed that it is like that, myself. Maybe it is because German tax are already god damn freaking high in the first place.

In Singapore we have Red Mart for grocery deliveries and you can ask them to drop the bag in front of your door in case you are still on the way home after work. Maybe suggest to them to implement a similar policy?

Yes of course, but isn't that why you connect to a mining pool? Would 100 million people connected via a mining pool make a difference?

Yes, on most, if not all marketplaces, you can sell your coins and then wire transfer the fiat back into your bank account.
Once you fully understand bitcoin, though, you will probably never want to sell. It's better to keep them until you can buy all your everyday stuff wit them without using fiat at all.

bitcoin.de has no special privacy or security, though. You have to send in personally identifying information just like for any other big bitcoin exchange.

If you think that your BTC is worth more tomorrow, you will ask yourself "do I *really* need to watch Netflix this month? I mean.. *really*?" If the answer is "No, not really", you won't waste your money on something you don't really need. Win!

The coins are not "in" some device. They are in the cloud. In the blockchain. The device is unimportant. The 24 word seed that you used when initiating the device is the important thing. You need to write it down on paper and store it at several secure locations.
If the device breaks, you buy a new one and initiate it again with the same seed.

By the time a clear winner emerges, the price will have skyrocketed so much that you probably would buy back in at a higher price as when you sold.
If you would attempt this, you would have to sit in front of the charts for days or even weeks 24/7 and really really know how to read them.

I have been doing this with 20 EUR every weekend for 2.5 years now. If I sold everything now, I'd make 52% profit (last time I checked, that value changes all the time, of course).
One far away day I'll hate myself for not putting in much more but this is a super worry-free way of doing it and as long as I can't buy bread with bitcoin I'll leave it at that amount.

If he shows you two addresses, one for the payment and one for the tip, doesn't that mean that you have to do two transactions and thus have to pay the transaction fee of 0.0005 two times?
It's probably a stupid question. I haven't yet understood who decides on this transaction fee. In my client (Electrum) 0.0005 is set as the default but it seems that I can change it to anything (including 0?).
What are the consequences if I change the transaction fee to something else?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:29:41
I made 10 transactions with bitcoin.de - no problem at all. There are many downsides, though: 
1. You must buy a minimum of 0.1 BTC - after fees you will end up having 0.0995 BTC which is not enough to sell them again. It's total bullshit.
2. When you want to withdraw to your wallet, you must withdraw at least 0.05 BTC. When you withdraw they set the transaction fee to 0.0005 which is quite hefty.
3. Trading is not instantaneous. When you buy you get the banking information of your trading partner and you must initiate the payment within 60 minutes. Once your partner confirms that he got the money, you will get your bitcoins. So that means if you buy on a Friday, it's very likely that your partner will only see the money on the next Tuesday - sucks if you need some coins quickly.
If I remember correctly, you have to verify your account in the same way as on most other exchanges. I think they send a small amount of money to your bank account to verify that it is yours.

Just write the seed into a textfile, GPG encrypt it with the longest possible password and put THAT file on as many cloud services as you can. 
that's the whole point of electrum as far as I understand so far (and I have asked them several times on IRC). just backup the seed, forget about the rest.
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:31:36
Or there will be much more transactions in one block and thus miners will get much more fees?

Raspberry Pi is a cheap creditcard-sized computer that is perfect for your purpose. You have a portable and cheap machine that you can utilise for your offline needs - no need to waste money on a real laptop or netbook.

So what should we use instead? bitcoin.de is crap and fybsg.com looks just as shady as mtgox (albeit I have had no problems so far and my emails are always answered promptly).

Upvoting because it works great, but currently the 0.1 minimum amount is a huuge hurdle for people who just want to spend their first 10 EUR to get into it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:13:28
They advertise these accounts when you login to bitcoin.de - they say you can open them now and when they are ready you would be able to finally do realtime trading. I started to open up one, the web interface looks all nice and flashy but I can't do the final verification step because it requires the postident procedure and I'm currently not living in Germany. I guess I'll open my account in March, when I'm back.

I have been setting 1sat/byte for all my transaction since 2 years now. No problems at all. Granted, I don't care about settlement speed.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:00:39
The minimum amount for sending BTC out of bitocin.de into your own wallet is 0.05 - that's even stranger.
I had 0.0996 or so left, then I created my first own wallet and wanted to try my first own transaction. I bumped into the 0.05 minimum, so I just sent that. Now I have 0.0496 left which are trapped inside bitcoin.de because their fucking minimum is 0.05 :)
Next time I buy there, I'll transfer everything out and keep the balance at 0...
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:25:31
They would still see a chart below that number that clearly went up all the time since years.

I don't like that their minimum amount is 0.1 - I want to buy 20 EUR of Bitcoin every week. Not possible on bitcoin.de

Would love to see this upvoted to the front-page and properly discussed.
I'm not smart enough to argue against this guy but from the research that I have done in the past few weeks I have the strong guts feeling that his whole argumentation is based on a wrong understanding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:49:28
Interesting, both exchanges that I use, bitcoin.de and fybsg.com set the transaction fee to 0.0005 when I want to withdraw into my own wallet. Should I bombard them with emails asking to lower the fee?
Who decides what "the current fees" should be like?
EDIT: Had a look at  and  - lot's of information to digest but 0.0001 seems to be the minimum required fee...

tar.gz is like a zip archive. run 'tar -xfvz filename' to extract it. Inside u usually have to run './configure' and after that 'make &amp;&amp; make install'.
This often only works if you have installed build-essentials. Check 
I'd say it's quite hopeless to install everything without ever going online. If you suspect that your adversary has setup a fake internet behind your router and you are installing spyware infested open source software when running apt-get, I'd argue that you are already fucked beyond repair and should go offline and leave the country as soon as possible.
I'd say it is OK to setup a raspberry pi, for example from a public terminal or another person's connection that has no strong ties to you, after that, never connect that machine to the internet again.
Of course, don't use the same keyboard that you use for your desktop PC. Use another one that you hide in a vault together with your RPi.
