You can quote me on that.

Sell for what? Paper that will be eventually deemed worthless and relegated to the history books?
This is the future of money, there's no such thing as selling, only throwing it away on monopoly money.

Bitcoin is teaching an entire generation to be fiscally responsible, and is therefore already changing the world.

No, interplanetary latency would be prohibitive were we to colonize even a nearby planet such as Mars. 
The most logical solution would be predominant blockchains on each planet in which they were used, and use of atomic swaps as a means of exchange. Settlement layers are a possibility, but that would require substantial changes to the consensus algorithm to deal with the latency.

Backtesting the sell strategy to the BCC fork, you'd have to execute PERFECTLY to make a nominal gain. Sounds dumb and probably not worth it in fees.
Just dump your 2x for BTC, you'll be better off at the expense of some 2x bagholder.

Never. 
When it succeeds, it will be the standard of money so there'd be no point in selling it. 
This is the only reason to suspect it will have a higher future value, if you don't believe this, then Bitcoin is pointless.

This guy gets it.
Bitcoin will replace fiat, that fiat needs to become Bitcoin somehow. There's always the risk that Bitcoin collapses, but how likely is that relative to the 100% certianty that fiat will lose 90% of its value?
The real problem with fiat is also the state, so if you're 99% certain that Bitcoin won't completely collapse, you're better off bankrupting yourself in terms of fiat to be rich in terms of Bitcoin. 
I'd rather have millions worth of BTC and a shit credit score than a good credit score and just a comfortable amount of fiat.

Slim and none, this has happened many times before.
Just don't do any transfers for a few days after it in case of replay.

You use their service for the same reason you use any non-core wallet, that wallets added features.
You back up your wallet with a mnemonic, so if their servers go tits up and you can't access their wallet software or 2FA mechanism, you can recover your coins in another wallet.
The "online" part is just how you execute the code, the code runs on your computer- they never have your keys. You just download the wallet from a webserver each time as opposed to storing it locally. 
Get a clue, you have no idea what you're talking about.

CU's still have to hold substantial liquid assets, those liquid assets are products of the big banks. Not only are they using your fiat to buy big bank products, fiat itself is a big bank product. You're delusional if you think you can avoid being a cog in their wheel.
So long as we still require some fiat exposure, take your heart out of it and get the best deal you can.

No one has a crystal ball, so the future is uncertain. 
However, there's no reason to suspect that Bitcoin is anything less than the protocolization of money. It solves for all the problems with gold and fiat, being superior in every way. 
I'd leave him with the question, when has vastly superior technology overtaken the status quo? Not often, and it doesn't look like this is one of those times either.
As for his theory about banks, he's clearly misinformed about Bitcoins features and benefits... so you probably need to educate him on the present to change his vision for the future.

That's not true, there are online wallets that don't hold your keys and you have the ability to restore without their service.
I'd suggest OmniWallet in the short term, op.

You can't have an efficient market with government involvement, this is why fiat needs to and will die.
