Dunno if you're joking but yeah... 
Somebody hacked my email, used that to reset passwords on various other accounts, somehow swiped my authy account, and transferred a not-insignificant amount of BTC out of my coinbase wallet...
I'll get a post together once I figure everything out...  
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:32:48
Nope.  I use lastpass...they were all different...although I hadn't changed my mail.com password in years, tbh
I asked mail.com for:
-  the ip of the hacker
- how was the password changed (did they log in normally and change the password?  Did they reset the password with my secret question?  Did they contact customer support and have them reset the password? etc)
- there were obviously some emails sent and received from my account that were deleted... can they be recovered?
- What happened to my email forwarding?  Normally when I log into that account the inbox is empty...everything just passed straight through.  Now I'm building up emails in the account starting early that morning.  
The forwarding feature that I pay them $20 a year for (for over 10 years now) is no longer there... instead, I can set a filter to forward mail once it arrives in the inbox, but then it still sits in that inbox.  
I could probably set up another filter to delete the mail after forwarding, but I can see bad things happening with an auto delete filter...if I forget to renew my premium account or my credit card expires, in the past, the mail would just stop forwarding and accumulate in the inbox until I give them a new card number...
It seems they completely redid their web interface, but haven't gotten around to implementing everything from their previous one.  It's possible that just logging into the new site cancelled my forwarding.  Their customer support is playing ignorant...they just tell me about the filters and "more features are coming soon!"...sigh...
As far as info about where and how the attacker got in, they can't tell me, because "security"
@_date: 2014-10-28 01:59:28
I thought you meant phishing for my mail.com password, since that's how they got in...
No, I've never logged into coinbase by clicking on a mail link...
@_date: 2014-10-27 22:29:57


Yeah, and efficient as well... I can't be the only one this guy has hit.


No idea.  Maybe there was a bitcoin forum site that got hacked?  I'm not on many.  I don't make it a secret that I own bitcoins, but I don't really talk about it all the time.  


Doubtful... as I said, I only use mail.com as a forwarding service.  I initially thought that my gmail was hacked first and that's how they got all the info on me (my phone number in my profile, search email for "bitcoin" to find all the sites I have accounts on, etc), but looking through the timestamps, my gmail password was only reset *after* the coinbase account was emptied.
Oh my god... It just occurred to me: **Butterfly Labs**
My account on BFL has my mail.com email, along with my phone number and address and an implicit connection to bitcoin...
Anybody heard of BFL being hacked?
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:10:47
Not saying I had the *tightest* security controls...obviously I got hacked. 
I'm still not sure exactly how they did it.  I do use *reasonable* security measures.
I use a password manager with different strong passwords on all of my accounts that matter.
I use https logins whenever possible (if not, I basically that account like it's public)
Somehow they got into my account at mail.com.  I only use that for the address, it forwards all mail to gmail, so I never log in there (probably last time was over 6 months ago)
Next thing I'm not sure of is how they got my phone number (mail.com didn't have it)...  They tried to call into customer service but couldn't get past the security screen (last 4 of social).  So they reset my password at att.com. 
Now, AT&amp;T claims that you can't set call forwarding from online, you need to do it from the phone...nevertheless they somehow set my phone to forward to a different number.
That's all it takes to defeat Authy 2FA.
From there, they reset my password at coinbase and swiped the bitcoins.
They tried the same thing at bitstamp and btc-e, but bitstamp uses Google Auth instead of authy, which requires a password to unlock your tokens.  I actually *didn't* have 2FA set up on BTC-e...but they don't allow withdrawals for 48 hours after a password change, so I lucked out there. 
So...lessons I took away:
1. Your *email account* needs to be locked down tight...not just your bitcoin accounts. I moved my account contacts from mail.com to gmail.com.  mail.com doesn't do 2FA...they do support SSL, but not by default...Since I never log in there my suspicion is that it was hacked by social engineering, but maybe I fucked up and accidentally logged in through the default form at some point...if so, it was a long time ago so why did I get hacked now?
1. Authy is not as secure as you think... It depends on your phone account... I added a PIN to my phone account (basically a secondary password that can't be reset through email)
2. Added GA 2FA to my gmail and btc-e accounts.
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:37:51
Just got robbed myself...
I was using 2FA, https, good passwords... Only wish I'd taken them offline :(

Not sure if trolling... do you really wanna hear what happened?

Cuz look at the original?

I was referring to your last point, specifically.  
The layperson can't be bothered to manage their own wallet...it took this incident to get me to make my own.  I knew I should have before, but Coinbase is easy, so procrastinate...
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:28:04


Picking up a 4 month old conversation... :)
I'm pretty sure now that my mail.com account was victim to an exploit.  If you're interested, there's a new article up about my bitcoin theft: 
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:57:56
Apparently this is something that authy *can* do, but didn't...because the android device accessing my account was in Long Beach, not Russia.
Apparently didn't matter to them that my phone was still active in  New Mexico at the time.
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:52:35
I don't know why I'm even responding to this troll, but:


This is kinda the point of the article.  Not everyone is a security expert, but sometimes bad things can happen even if you think you've taken reasonable security precautions.


Irrelevant and false.


Also irrelevant and false. (My windows machine is pretty much gaming-only)


Also the point of the article.
@_date: 2015-03-06 01:49:32
Oh yeah, making it an optional setting would be fine.
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:47:31
I'm guessing I was on a list.  I never announced anything...
They knew my phone number already, which makes me think it was a customer list from somewhere I bought something using bitcoins.  
I don't think they went through a staggering amount of work...it seemed to me more like they were running through a well-versed procedure.  It took them exactly 15 minutes from first resetting my coinbase password to defeating authy and logging in.  I really doubt this was all aimed at me personally... they were too efficient.  Judging from timestamps, it looks like they spent about an hour on me and all my accounts.
The article doesn't mention the details, but they first called AT&amp;T customer service, but couldn't answer my security question.  Then they went to my online att.com account and hit up the support chat.  Told them I had lost my phone and needed it forwarded.  In the chat, instead of asking my security question, they verify you by...sending a verification code to your email.  (There's an obscure legal reason why they can't ask your security question online)
BTW, I've since learned that you can set up a secondary PIN on your AT&amp;T account.  You need to enter it even if your password is reset, and you need it to chat with customer support.  I highly recommend anybody using AT&amp;T set one up if you haven't aleady.
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:10:40
Nope, Authy supports both its own native tokens and Google Authenticator tokens.  I use both.
If you reinstall authy, you need to enter the "backups password" to access your GA tokens, but native authy tokens come right up as soon as it's installed.
This isn't mentioned anywhere in the docs, as far as I know...the only reason I know is that I had to reinstall authy because the hacker kicked my phone off the account when he installed it on his.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:48:11
My tanks are fine :)
Actually an officer in my clan got hacked a while back and they cleaned out the clan treasury...
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:55:44


That is how I felt about authy once I tracked down what happened.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to clone an authy account.  I mean, *it has a password*, they just don't use it!
GA is much more secure, IMO.  They couldn't have gotten past it with just my phone number.
Although...when I thought about it more, it would still be possible to bypass GA by hacking Apple ID and using it to restore onto another iphone, with GA tokens intact.


Or, to the layperson, more realistically:
* Don't use Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:24:03
GA is safer, yes.  Authy is *exactly* as safe as the text code, since that's what they do to verify your authy install.
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:02:06
Good for you!
I'm glad somebody is treating this as a wake up call rather than telling me how much better they are than me at internet security...
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:16:37
I disagree...and I've told coinbase this...
I think a 2 day delay on password reset is a fine tradeoff for the security it provides.  
Password resetting is not an everyday thing.  Anyone actively using their account won't be doing it, and I can't imagine there is a large percentage of your customers who haven't used coinbase in months and have forgotten their password, but need to spend some BTC *right now.* 
Next time, they'll remember their password.
On the other hand, the ability to reset the password in the middle of the night and empty the account immediately is a *huge* convenience for BTC thieves.
I considered using the vault, but the mandatory 2 day delay is too inconvenient for me...  If I want to buy or sell BTC, it's probably because of some large fluctuation happening right now.  *I know my password.*  I'd much rather protect my account from people who *don't* know my password.
Maybe if I had hundreds of BTC, the vault might be worth it, but I only had 10 on coinbase.  Normally, I have more money than that available in my checking account...
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:25:49
Ouch.  That's just a mean-spirited hack...
I lost some money, sure...wasn't my life savings or anything.  With the bitcoins I have left, I'd guess I'm still around even overall.
I back up my macbook regularly, but just losing my entire gmail history would be devastating... I would assume google has the capability to roll back an account and recover it, but how would you even ask them to do that?  Gmail has no human-manned customer service that I could locate...
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:50:20
Just noting that I *did* have Authy activated on coinbase... That was one of the weak spots.  I use GA now...
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:43:59
I was pleasantly surprised by BTC-e.  I was also impressed with Bitstamp.  They request KYC information when you set up your account, so they had a picture of my photo ID.  When the hacker asked them to reset my GA token, they said they would only do it if I sent them another picture of my photo ID from a different angle, which is good because then they couldn't just find it in my sent mail history.  
Hmm...reminds me...time to delete all ID photos from my sent mail.
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:45:07
1. Did *you* know mail.com had a vulnerability?  I didn't.
2. They don't.
3. I was using authy on coinbase... part of the problem, actually.
4. I've fixed that now.  Even so, that's not really the point... what if I'd only had half of my bitcoins online? or 30%, or 10%? I *still* got robbed.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:26:44
Probably pretty short...
"This is AT&amp;T...for verification purposes, may I have the answer to your security question?"
...hangs up
@_date: 2015-03-04 22:43:45
A few things:
I am not denying that I made some mistakes... The reason for having this article written, I think, is as a warning...maybe it will help prevent an attack like this in the future.
"Eve" could have done a lot worse to me with this access.  As far as I can tell, none of my bank or credit card accounts were accessed.  The Twitter thing was just cheeky...I barely use it anyway.  Facebook would have been another matter, simply because of the number of sites that I have linked to that account for convenience...
As far as my mail.com account,  I just liked the simplicity of the address.  I'd had it for 15 years or so... I was paying them $20 a year just to forward mail.  Honestly, it never even occurred to me that it could be an attack vector.  I never logged in there and there was no email stored there (the article was incorrect there)...it was basically out of sight, out of mind... 
I'd never heard of any vulnerabilities at mail.com before.  Their customer support refused to tell me *any* information about how my password was reset "because security", so I got suspicious.  It actually took a while to find that there had been well known (in some circles) exploits for resetting mail.com passwords.
Since all this, I've discovered that mail.com does not support any 2FA, and in fact, makes it pretty awkward to even use SSL (not on by default).  Way back when I got the account, nobody had 2FA, so I didn't miss it.
So I had what I thought were *reasonable* security precautions in place.  I don't claim to be a security expert, but I'm not some chump who clicks links in every email claiming to be from my bank.  My gmail got hacked a few years back and sent spam to all my contacts, so I changed to a more secure password and set up 2FA... I didn't think it warranted going all out with Google Authenticator...just the SMS code, thank you.
Authy was a huge disappointment.  I was using authy over GA because of the backup feature.  I had heard stories about people getting a new phone and losing all of their GA tokens, but authy backs them up for you, protected by a password.  What they *don't* mention (and the article didn't explicitly mention, either) is that *only* GA tokens are protected in Authy by a password.  That means that all native authy tokens are accessible once somebody installs authy on any device with my account (verified with email and phone number, both of which they had).
Coinbase only supported authy when I first set it up.  They support GA tokens now, but the security page still recommends I "upgrade" my security to authy instead.
Oh...the bitstamp part in the article is actually incorrect...I was actually using GA 2FA on bitstamp and when I got my mail.com account back I saw an email from them replying to a request to reset my GA token "because I got a new phone".  They said they would only do that if I sent them a photo of my drivers license... KYC FTW :)

True dat. 
I keep the majority of my remaining bitcoin in a paper wallet now.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:31:16
I guess I can answer that now that I have my own PIN on the account.  
By default the security question is the last 4 of your SSN, and apparently for some reason it's illegal for them to ask your SSN online, so for online chat they verify you by sending a code to your email.  Not optimal.
