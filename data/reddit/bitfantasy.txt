Nic game.  Thought i'd also mention my bitcoin RPG (also web browser based) which lets you trade items with each other for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:03:01
Good luck, sometimes you have to work on what you really find interesting :)

Hi, trial server is now here :)
Thanks for your interest!
@_date: 2014-02-21 22:51:01
By popular demand we've created a trial server for our game. 
 * The trial world has only some of the quests and you can't leave the castle walls. No Bitcoin prizes are payable.
 * No items or experience you gain can be carried over to the full server, to prevent disrupting the economy
 * Players can buy from each other using bitcoin on the trial server, however this is for testing purposes only - you will not be able to transfer any items you buy this way to the full server.
 * The Magpie trading network is switched off(this is a way of placing bids for items you want, and have them delivered to you).
 * We may delete old inactive accounts/properties/items or have to reset the world.
 * In the full game everyone has a constantly generating set of turns (to make the game fair) but in the trial these turns don't regenerate, you have a day or two's worth of play in turns in the trial world depending on how you play.
 Remember this game is still under development and by signing up you are helping us to keep improving it, Thanks!

I disagree, smartphones have malware. I for one can imagine buying one of these.

Hey... i'm late to this (and I know it doesn't do the mining) but my indie RPG has a lot of the aspects you mention:   :)
@_date: 2013-09-28 22:09:48
That one is a must-watch, really took my interest to another level when I saw it.
@_date: 2013-02-23 18:29:29
Beta access is in the next week or two. It is a large amount of work but I develop software for a living so i'm up to the challenge :)
@_date: 2013-02-23 15:15:57
..or even decrease if BTC rises a lot!  It's going to be interesting seeing the dynamics of this.  Since BTC is an internet currency I should theoretically not change the entrance fee but in reality it might need readjusting.
Free access for testers - I would be happy to but I still want the bitcoin connection for new accounts (for reasons stated above) i'll give beta testers early access and they will definately be rewarded for getting in early.  For one thing property and locations are ownable so it means getting first dibs on some property, and also items that might not be available later for balance reasons.
@_date: 2013-04-23 06:52:39
The site suggests they just mail them in the normal post (postage is very low), I would be wary of that.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:57:45
Maybe Payment Request Protocol would be a better name (based on my understanding of it anyway).
In theory I guess you could ignore the "protocol", look inside it and manually send to one or more of the addresses inside. The receiver may balk at that though :)
I see this spec as a formalisation of what already happens in various ways- you can already generate unique addresses yourself and display on your SSL secured web page for people to pay to, and ask them to provide a return address.  The spec enables other niceties to be expected as standard, like a message and way of defining refund addresses so code can deal with it easier.

You'd rather bankers do it, as with fiat? 
@_date: 2013-09-03 10:21:31
Thanks, it's really hard work but worth it!

+tip 0.01 BTC verify 
More for you to spend without transaction costs eating most of it - and if you still have .01 BTC in week or two then when it's released you might like to play [my game]( :-).
@_date: 2013-09-02 19:51:00
Cool.  There is - you can click on the edit icon next to an items GP or BTC price when looking at it's details. (Have to admit the edit icon isn't obvious, must change it).
@_date: 2013-02-23 18:17:21
Oh, 0.01 BTC is more like 30 cents isn't it now. Tracking prices will be "fun" :)
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:25:00
It is, more stressful though :D
@_date: 2013-07-31 07:44:34
Wow, so glad I didn't go with Kickstarter now, every time I saw some new project on there I wondered if I should, I'm doing my own open beta + crowdfunding instead (people fund in BTC not fiat) and glad I did, I don't want to be at the whim of Kickstarter.
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:21:35
Brilliant, bitcoin is a perfect match for Indies like me!
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:18:21
 Nice. Now I crave Pizza though.
@_date: 2013-02-23 18:29:59
I think you are probably right there, i'll have to keep an eye on it.
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:17:27
oops,  hehe - sure just PM me the address you paid to and i'll get one sent back.
@_date: 2013-02-23 15:09:00
I forgot to mention, for anyone interested you can see a small work in progress screenshot on the site here  , the game interface is pure HTML.  You can follow us at  too :)
@_date: 2013-02-23 15:10:51
It's a good idea, I did think of that, it introduces a lot of complexity and risk though (I have to reliably track pseudo-financial transactions and cash out to bitcoins etc..). Perhaps at a later date.
@_date: 2013-07-24 17:06:30
To anyone unsure, I can confirm that spideroak is awesome, I like the control over folders compared to dropbox.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:34:11
I'm fine with metric but agree with OP. 
On the bitcoin symbol, I'm not keen on any of them entirely. The uppercase one looks somehow lopsided with just one horizontal dash.
Maybe we need symbols for the subunits
Ⓑ  for bits :) You can just type "b" on a mobile phone
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:37:31
The problem is that the "trade crunching" can only be done with stale (albeit nanosecond stale) data if you do it in parallel. i.e one of the other threads might be trying to take the same bid as yours. 
I do think there are improvements to be made and I don't think the single threaded approach is very forgiving for server admins to manage.  
I have a background in financial programming so it's a tempting problem to work on - however the real problem would be that of holding/transferring large amounts of money through the bank without being shut down, I don't think the technical stuff is that difficult.
On the main subject. Well done, its a good idea and needed. I'm not convinced by node.js though - I worry about exchanges built on loosely typed interpreted languages (PHP too). I would use Java as something boring but predictable and it has a wide skilled developer base.
@_date: 2013-02-25 11:10:39
I think it's a nice idea.  An alternative approach is to develop an in-app purchasing API so that developers release their apps for free in the Play Market but they can be unlocked to varying degrees using BTC.  Not sure what Google would make of that.
@_date: 2013-10-17 10:53:38
Yep, playing with JS and bitcoin too, in a slightly different way :)
@_date: 2013-02-23 18:24:53
+tip 0.01 BTC verify  
Thanks, I want to test the tip bot and also this is a symbolic "free access" for when it's up and running :)
@_date: 2013-09-09 19:22:30
Indeed, I've found kids like my game (doesn't have any gambling) and they can sign up directly with bitcoin instead of needing a parents credit card.
@_date: 2013-10-17 10:57:42
It makes sense when it's for use between players (rather than a pay-to-win type thing),  that's what i've strived for in my bitcoin trading enabled RPG over at  
The bitcoin benefit is you pay the other players directly to their wallet when you buy items from them, no "cashing out" and no fees.
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:10:55
This seems like a really good idea, nice work.
@_date: 2013-09-08 22:22:43
I think he says you need a coinbase account *or* a bitcoin address, so it could be optional.
@_date: 2013-03-30 07:33:54
I may be wrong but I don't believe the problem is coding (it should be fairly simple) but being able to deal with fiat currencies.
@_date: 2013-03-02 09:25:16
I know what you mean but it will get better, there *is* a nice experience to be had though - if the first thing the public saw was   that would be much better for adoption I imagine.
I'm trying to get a new bitcoin web site out there (a web based RPG game) and it's a really tough choice between trying to make it look good and releasing it in a timely fashion so I do understand it from both points of view.
@_date: 2013-09-09 13:52:30
Yeah it's maybe a bit of both, I assume anything below a certain amount has to be off the blockchain and a lot of that type of clicking-for-money work is (I assume) very small amounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:12:11
Would this work?  You have X amount of USD in MtGox, you own Y amount of MtGox coloured bitcoins which indicates you own X amount of USD to any third party who recognises those colourings. So far so good.
Then you then spend that USD in MtGox leaving you with NO USD yet you still own the coloured coins and i'm lost as to the purpose of these coloured coins.
As I read back my message I understood how it works - you have to use the coloured coins to buy the BTC, not USD. I think the real problem then would be getting every exchange to accept every other exchanges new currency.  You'd need a standard one, something like bitcoin ;-)
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:05:37
Bought the Humble Bundle package.
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:09:38
Thanks! Trying to keep improving every aspect.
 There's a new item (the Autopot) which does what you suggest (I think), it creates as many of one meal as it can.  
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:00:13
Wow :)
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:59:09
Thanks :)

Supporter's inns will have an innkeeper who can partially heal you, and other handy things. We are still implementing them to be honest, so they will get better :)
@_date: 2013-10-17 14:26:27
This is mine, an HTML5 RPG with bitcoin trading.
@_date: 2013-09-06 23:19:47
Great video and inspiring lifestyle.
+bitcointip 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2013-09-02 18:08:58
Thanks, I respect your self restraint. I have to do the same :)
@_date: 2013-09-02 10:15:34
You may remember I mentioned this idea some months ago.  Well I went for it and have been working full time on this since then.  It doesn't have microtransactions, doesn't nickel and dime you - it just **enables** you to directly trade virtual items with bitcoin - your payment literally appears in the other players wallet.  You can play the game entirely without paying any more money, but you can actually win bitcoin too :)
It's constantly being developed but from the closed period people seem to really like it.  We didn't go down the Kickstarter type route and instead are hoping people will help fund us directly, and with bitcoin,  so.. support us, support bitcoin and play a fun game too :)
try "reddit" as the promo code :)
@_date: 2013-08-20 10:23:12
+1 on the QR code (linked to MAC) - It's a much nicer user experience.
@_date: 2013-03-01 11:44:55
I totally agree,  new tech bubbles under until there is enough use for it and then the feedback loop really gets going.  
It's an opportunity to get into an as yet uncrowded space for creators. I'm working on an app for people to spend some of their internet currency on (even if it's just 0.01 BTC) -    it's a RPG game. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:13:49
Dragon has reminded me to say that we'll be improving crafting in general in future, with variable ingredient quantities :)
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:58:36
I understand your point about informed decisions, it's perfectly valid, reviews and videos will come with time.  Minecraft wasn't actually unique though, it was heavily inspired by a couple of other games.  I ignored minecraft at first too when I saw notch post about it on the tigsource game dev forums, I saw the screenshots and dismissed it.  I ended up getting in at beta stage, I rarely play it now because of addiction and time :) 
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:54:38
It was invite only until yesterday, we are in the very early days, it's still very playable but I understand you want to wait until you see more information, that's totally natural.  We have someone looking at doing a video now :)
@_date: 2013-02-24 09:47:33
Thanks for your support :) I'll try to contact everyone who expressed an interest, if you use twitter that would be a good way to stay updated too:  
@_date: 2013-03-04 20:53:12
Either in game gold pieces (it's an AD&amp;D style RPG) or bitcoin can be used to buy items from other players. Bitcoin transactions can be done directly between players, it's not against the TOS.  You earn GP as in any RPG, through quests, battles etc.  A couple of quests also end in you winning a genuine (though digital, of course) shiny whole Bitcoin :)
I'm hoping for an open beta in a week or two, it really depends what level of roughness i'm willing to accept just for the sake of getting it out there.
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:51:07
Thanks! Yep very happy with the bitfantasy logo I commissioned through :)  
@_date: 2013-09-02 11:11:54
Yes that's right, either you could win a prize or (more likely) you can sell items to other players.  I haven't checked recently but at least two items have been sold for real bitcoin using the in game escrow system.
@_date: 2013-09-02 17:49:03
You actually never need to do that, if someone trades with you for bitcoin then the bitcoin you earn goes directly to the bitcoin wallet you specify when you sign up.
You can't cash out Gold Pieces to Bitcoin, in a future update we'll probably allow player to player gold/btc trading though.
@_date: 2013-10-16 20:29:03
Very nice combination of technology :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:31:51
Sorry I missed the diagram - it does look like a sensible approach.  I wonder where the real bottleneck is for places like MtGox because, really it's not that much effort comparing two numbers. 
If their front ends are impacting the matching then it's just naive architecture that's the problem.
