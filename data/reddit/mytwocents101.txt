This seems like it could be a game changer.  Sometimes I forget that the whole crypto world is pretty small in the big scheme of things. Entering the Nasdaq puts everything in with the big players!

While true, the price absolutely matters. It is what determines how many sats I can get for my USD.

So many problems with this comment...
\ - Just because the BTC was gotten through a Ponzi scam doesn't mean that the criminals who got it have different motives than anyone else. TONS of people are selling at around $10k (and every other price point). Maybe the criminals need some extra cash to fund a vacation. Or to pay debt. Or to invest into their next scam. Their reasons for selling at this particular point will be no different than anyone elses. (of course, they could believe that BTC is going to $0 and that is why they are selling, but that doesn't imply that they have more knowledge than anyone else. It is just their investment strategy). 
\ - A bunch of their co-conspirators were caught and jailed. The others involved may be getting nervous and just need some money to hide or pay off police or whatever. 
\ - They may fear that their BTC would get blacklisted on exchanges at some point, so they wanted to sell what they can for as much as they can. 
I'm sure many other reasons. This 'logic' in the post is ridiculous.

It is fun to make comparisons like this to see how much more upside bitcoin really has. That being said, however, it isn't like the success of bitcoin is certain. When talking to friends/family who ask about it I typically say that in 10 years, bitcoin will almost certainly be either $1 Million + OR less than $500. 
There is massive potential for reward, but also very significant risk. Tons of ways that this could all go south. Invest in bitcoin whatever you are willing to put into the very high risk category of your portfolio and hope for the best. Personally, I think the chances of success vs failure are approaching 50/50 at this point, but that is just a guess.

About 5-10% Crypto (of which 70% is BTC). 90-95% Stocks. This is primarily because stocks are in my 401(k) and I can't control that. I also can't withdrawal without paying large penalties. And on top of that, I keep dumping into the 401(k) because company matches 7% on my 6% investment, so from the start I am over 100% up on ROI, which is hard to pass up. 
IF my 401(k) let me do crypto I would prolly be something like 70% crypto, 30% stocks right now. This is mostly because I think we are at or near the top of the longest lasting stock bull run ever (though I've been saying that for a year or two now).  In a more 'normal' market I would want something like 50-50 I think.

Step 1 - Ignore the 500 messages you are going to recieve where people tell you to give them your private keys (or send you the BTC) and they will send PayPal directly.  Even if they send first, they can reverse their transaction tomorrow and you can't!. 
Step 2 - Sign up for some type of exchange (even CashApp will work fine).  Send the BTC there, sell it for USD, Withdrawal to your bank account. 
Step 3 - Prepare for the depression that will set in over the next 3-10 years as BTC goes to $1 Million+ and you sold at $6500, you idiot. 
Step 3 Alternate Ending - Prepare for joy that will set in over the next 3-10 years as BTC plummets to $500 or less and you sold at $6500, you genius.

I'm a freelance writer. I'll gladly take Bitcoin.

I just got an apple watch, and I'm using "Crypto Pro" (The free version so far). 
So far, it seems to work pretty well. Only been using it about 48 hours though, so can't give a full 'review.'

Well, that's it boys. This is the death of Bitcoin. Sell now while you can! /s

So...What if 1 sat does eventually = $1.  
Can Bitcoin be divided further than Satoshis? (without a code change and potential fork that is).  I think 1 sat = $.01 would be much more convenient, not that we get to pick and choose of course.

Thanks for the advice! How low will it go? And by when? 
(I like watching these types of posts, especially if they make specific predictions, to see how spot on, or way off they were.)

Yes, one of those. Or perhaps sideways. 
I'm confident it will be one of those three.
