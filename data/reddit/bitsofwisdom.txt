Why use this crapwallet when there is Coinomi ?!
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:14:02
My point is rather simple really. Hold your coins in a wallet you control. Ideally, use Monero, instead of the PUBLIC ledger that is bitcoin.  
Screw Marxist gubments!

If you read a bit deeper, you will find out that you are greatly mistaken. Monero is the new boss of anonymity.  
Bitcoin is history, unless you fancy having all your transactions being public knowledge for eternity.

...nor decentralised, nor unmanipulated... but shush, lest they learn that Monero is now all of that.  
The King is dead, long live the King!

I agree with you on the crypto pyramid, but at the same time the fiat pyramid is orders of magnitude bigger and you fail to account that apart from it collapsing (default), it could also be (hyper)inflated away...  
The return of Zimbabwe corporate bonds did not save their holders from the vortex - LOL. I have seen such a scenario first hand and trust me - the loss is quick and unforgettable to the fools who held...  
There is always a first time for everything. ;)

LOL, I hope you do not seriously believe this pure propaganda drivel.  
By debasing the currency all that the Central Bank$ters achieve is effectively THEFT from all the human animals in a tax-farm (otherwise known as a "state"), in combination with the threat of it in order to control the (so called) "government", which is (s)elected to manage the tax-farm.  
It is another form of Marxist Central Planning and THEFT, just like all the other Marxist forms of theft, only a GLOBAL one.  
It is worth mentioning that if money debasement could cause economic growth, then Zimbabwe and Venezuela would be extremely prosperous countries right about now... :-P

You must be a fortune teller then.  
Tell me the future?  
Do bear in mind that at silver $45 a few years back MOST were predicting $200/oz silver 'soon'... In 2006 Enron was the 'most stable business' ...etc. etc.  
I'd keep all my money in btc if I were you- either you get rich quick, or poor even quicker.  
(BTW I bought btc at $200, sold half at $950 - current cost basis ZERO)

I can sell you all BTC at only 30% premium on the price and advise on how to store them- ha ha!
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:55:05
You could have done this when btc was $200, but hey - why buy low to sell high, when one can do the opposite... right?  
People never learn.
One correction back to, say even $1k and you are done.  
Sick.  
I do wish you luck with your health though!
I hope you get over the illness and wise up a bit too.  
Also, if indeed, God forbid, your illness is terminal, why do you even care about making money?!

Guess what: regulations about taxation of your Roth IRA can change substantially until the time when your $1,000 turns into $1 million.   
In fact they can change to the point where the then failed / broke government of your country can either confiscate the content of your IRA or prohibit you from withdrawing, not to mention that they can carpet-tax IRA with an arbitrary amount of tax.
Do not believe me?!  
Then you need to see this:
