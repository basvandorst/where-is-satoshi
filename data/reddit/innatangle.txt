A deflationary currency indicates that the total available pool of money is shrinking, couple that with higher interest rates and this WILL consolidate more money to those that have it.
One of the great successes of our current economic (inflationary) system is that it has lifted millions of people out of poverty. Bitcoin in its current form will not do this, in fact it will entrench poverty. It's only seen as squaring the ledger at the moment because Bezos doesn't have it.
It's possible that the world could revolt against the richest people by choosing to transact in crypto leaving fiat worthless, but it won't be done by swapping to a currency that only further entrenches inequality. Also, the world won't choose to go with a currency where the cost to pay for a cup of coffee can be a cup of coffee itself.

Won't happen as Bitcoin is deflationary and therefore encourages hoarding of currency. People can hate on inflationary currencies all they want, but inflation is what helps to increase the velocity of money. Inflation is what incentivises people with lots of money to not leave it in the bank, but to go out and spend it.

Yep, that's exactly what I was alluding to. Now imagine the situation of a wholesaler. They would potentially be in the situation of buying at x and be perhaps forced into a situation where they would sell for equal to or less than the purchase price despite the fact they probably added value to the product.
The idea that the intrinsic power of a unit of Bitcoin would increase over time is true too. What we witness in today's economy is that there comes a point where having more than a certain amount of money becomes superfluous to an individual's needs, i.e. the addition of an extra $100 to a person's bank account has no real positive effect on a millionaire compared to someone who is living on $500/week.
In the case of BTC, I can foresee this effect being exacerbated because as the peasants scrape for every satoshi they can find due to lower product prices. Those who already have more than enough will be paying less for more. Trying to sketch this concept out hurts my brain, but I don't think I'm wrong in my conclusions.
Whilst BTC is an inflationary currency at the moment, it's designed to be capped at 21 million. Whilst I see it's termed a finite supply (in theory 21 million will be available to everyone all the time, therefore neither inflationary or deflationary), in reality it's doubtful that this is the case. How many people have lost their keys? How many people with BTC balances have died and taken their keys with them? In the real world, the supply of BTC will dry up and it will become a deflationary currency.
People will have to design ways of overcoming these obstacles. One solution could be to reclaim funds in dormant wallets, but the cynics would rightly point out that this would take away an individual's right to hold onto money indefinitely. The other solution is to create BTC to make up for the BTC being lost out of the system... Well that sounds a whole lot like what is happening at the moment.
As I browse many of the threads, I see many people caught between the paradox of spending and HODLing. Why spend when one BTC today when it could buy you more tomorrow? But what is a currency if it's not being used as a medium of exchange between individuals for goods and services rendered? The default position that is then taken is that it's a store of value. But it's only a store of value if there is some sort use case for it in the future. Gold can at least be melted down and used for things like jewellery, or conductors in high grade electrical components. Gold can be repurposed from a store of value to actually performing physical function, a BTC doesn't have this luxury.
I think there is a future for crypto, but I don't think BTC in its current form is it. Its achilles heel is the fact it's inherently deflationary. That doesn't say there's not money to be made at the moment, there certainly is. If BTC doesn't surpass it's previous ATH on this current rally, then I don't think that's a promising sign for it in the long term.

Gold is inflationary. Mining (the moving earth variety) adds to the total pool of gold. It's the scarcity of new discoveries that keeps inflation in check.
Lifting people out of poverty was achieved by the expanding economy. Expanding economies allow for specialisation. Specialisation is what enables individuals to be more productive at their work. An economy can't expand if the pool of available money is capped as there will always be some individuals who'll accumulate more, leaving less for everyone else. In a world of shrinking money supply, anything you buy will be worth less tomorrow as other people won't be able to afford it.

UBI doesn’t recognise an individual’s need to be valued for the responsibility they take on and the utility they provide to the community. UBI simply pays people to exist.

The problem that I have with the argument about ‘providing for the basics’ is it assumes that the current economic state won’t change. Any pragmatist knows that this is not a truth that holds water. I would happily lay down a big wager that whilst we would see short term advantages, a return to the current status quo would happen in the medium to the long term.
By increasing the supply of money, demand for consumable items would rise which would result in price increases, likely seeing everything back to where it is now; an increasing gap between the ultra rich and the middle/lower classes. An example of this in the present day was the introduction of the first home owner’s grant in Australia. The result of the increased economic activity in the housing sector saw prices climb and the continuation of the problem of housing affordability.
Finally, as I said before, UBI does nothing for the basic psychological need to feel wanted and valued. We already see high amounts of depression in lower socioeconomic areas that receive the lion’s share of social welfare. Now there’s probably a fair amount of interplay between what is causal and what is symptomatic, but the fact remains, receiving welfare doesn’t seem to help people in these mental states.
