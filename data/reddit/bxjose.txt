Still risky because you need to trust the other party (buyer, who is often less trustworthy than the seller) to complete their end of the deal
Just reread and both parties need to be trusted for this system to work. Its worse than something with a middleman, because you only need to trust 1 party. The suggestion does not move trust from people to a network, rather requires trust in all involved parties. A network of voting nodes could be used as a middleman instead, if there is a dispute, nodes could vote, be rewarded for voting and achieve consensus to correctly attribute coins. This would remove the Amazon problem of buyer is always right and sellers boosting sale prices because a loss due to buyers is inevitable.

Thats strange, you'd expect the opposite.

I think you might've made a mistake with the address. The transaction is confirmed, your wallet should show the new balance (usually recognises valid transactions within seconds before its even confirmed because the tx propagates by flooding).

Says it has 3 conf. Check address again

Readjusts every 2016 blocks based on mean block time to reach 1 block/10 min
Each node calculates the difficulty target independently and should all reach the same result using the same formula

Well the lines are clear enough. If there was a pattern like the dinosaur or bart simpson, the prediction would be even more certain.
