*Sigh*... multiple cryptographers have pointed out issues with IOTA along with security experts. 
again if you noticed in my flippant comment "Iota may increase in value" exactly because of the reasons you mentioned... it's being marketed to suits, many suits. 
they also seem to have the most fanatic bag holders - which you have just affirmed. 
yes large companies are not adverse to having their heads firmly shoved up rear ends. Volkswagen would never do a thing like falsifying documents or lie to the public... never ever... ever at all they are perfect! Bosch wouldn't help VW cover it up either? no... never would think of it. 
Again as i said (and you have also), it's quite possible It will increase in value - with heavy marketing and integration with multi-nationals.

God also told Davis that 640x480, 16-color graphics "is a covenant like circumcision," making it easier for children to make drawings for God.

this seems like an insane round-a-bout way to come up with a final figure for healthcare pricing.
do you goto the store and milk is listed at $10 then you say $2, then the clerk says $5 then you say $4. this is a completely pointless endeavour in obscurity.


no - you pay for private or are defaulted to the public system.  not BOTH.
the current government has further moved towards the US system... guess what? prices have gone up and insurance companies have made tons of money.
Every point you have brought up has been moving the goalposts switching issues.
is our system perfect ? no - but it's not the dumpster fire that is US healthcare.
time for me to move some goalposts - how bout them infant mortality rates, childhood disease rates, average lifespan - all worse in the USA. higher obesity and diabetes,  despite US citizens being gouged everytime they seek healthcare.

Ignore whos paying for a second - $2000 for a dislocated shoulder or $1800 for conjunctivitis is what happens in a healthcare system like the usa.
if you compare the raw cost of surgery, medication and hospital stays - the US  always has inflated prices.
we have private healthcare in Australia - also you can always see the "cost" price even if you pay partially for it or its covered by as you yankees love to call it "the single payer".
**We are shocked not that we have to pay when travelling - it's that the prices are much higher than in Australia, even ignoring what is usually covered by your insurance or public coverage.**
say you have happy happy "**non** socialist -  i'm a capitalist, SOCIALISM SCARY healthcare".

In australia your PRIVATE healthcare company will be charged $350 (this is removing any """SOCIALISM"""' or government payment from the charge)

"Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory
"Cultural Marxism" in modern usage refers to a conspiracy theory which sees the Frankfurt School as part of an ongoing movement to take over and destroy Western culture.[55]"

/waves hand over head. 
did i say capitalism was evil? I'm pointing out that putting "evil" or "good" is pointless to economic discussion and around finance. 
it's like saying "nuclear power and radiation is evil". well some may think this until you need radiation therapy. 
Edit: i'm a socialist, capitalism is not inherently good or evil, socialism is not good or evil.

Satoshi Released bitcoin under the MIT license one supported by the FSF (fsf.org) 
think about that for a second.
Satoshi even supported the GPL license for other purposes. 
Satoshi 2010 - 
"If the only library is closed source, then there's a project to make an open source one.
If the only library is GPL, then there's a project to make a non-GPL one.
If the best library is MIT, Boost, new-BSD or public domain, then we can stop re-writing it.
I don't question that GPL is a good license for operating systems, especially since non-GPL code is allowed to interface with the OS.  For smaller projects, I think the fear of a closed-source takeover is overdone."

Bingo you got it. 
Unfortunately this is how all fiat money works as well. the difference is that the "backer" is the us government promises that the USD is mandated to be accepted as currency in shops, taxes etc.
All money is only as good as the grand delusion. 
bitcoin is also apolitical like gold. there is no "bitcoin government" or "gold government" forcing anyone to use it as currency. 
this "intrinsic value" argument is so freaking annoying. NO fiat money has intrinsic vale. 
ALL fiat money looks like a ponzi scheme... however do we really want to go back to trading 1 chicken for 1 horse saddle?
this is why bitcoin is so powerful it's apolitical internet money it speaks to those that Jerk off over Ayan Rand books while screaming "THE FREE MARKET SOLVES ALL PROBLEMS" 
and Also socialists who are like me and say "fiat money is abused by large governments", "reducing the power of the government over the money supply is a good thing".  (some may argue that it's a sort of "check and balance to just turning on the money printers).

Forks play games with new users in a not obvious way, it's fine for you and I, try explaining the Bcash debacle to your grandmother. 
Bcash is fine, call it that... own it,  BCH being deceptive and now this satoshi vision garbage. 
It's akin to buying some chinese knock off, sure maybe the new "xiomi 8" is great but selling it on ebay as a "iphone x"... that's deceptive and shitty and bcash and bitcoin forks are guilty of this.
Say we both know a good new shitcoin, "shitcoinx". "Shitcoinx" is good we get people to buy it, some people dont and that's fine too.
Now bitcoin, we do the same and now hundreds are buying "roger ver cash big block edition 7" and "shit vision satoshi 3". 
At some point its not just gullibility its scam artists being scam artists

fine disagree but don't be a chicken shit... especially not when write an ENTIRE FREAKING BOOK. about being "tough" with people and standing up for your values. Boot straps. speaking truth to power. the importance of "enlightenment" era discussion.
the dude is a half witted spineless pseudo-intellectual coward. If you want someone with a half a back bone and a piece of intellectual nous, dig up Christopher Hitchens decaying corpse and stick a drink in his hand he would make Peterson look like a dumb fucking sophomore parroting Ayan Rand. 
sorry the man shits me more than warranted... he's not even that bad when it comes to clinical psychology. 
But him talking about anything other than clinical psychology and he looks like a lobotomised lobster. [ba dum tst](

* sounds like Fractional Reserve on steroids. 
* Im sure during historical periods this is what was used - except it would have been pre-capitalism ~Fuedal/slave periods -  so it would be hard to use this, as pro/cons to a full reserve system V others. 
* Full reserve system you would have to pay the bank to hold/protect your money, not the other way round. how would a bank pay interest?
I still would be interested to see a Gov/Society try it however, but I would bet on it failing miserably.

He's a Marxist Economist, not a "neo-marxist postmodernist" (something that doesn't even fucking exist) 
Christopher Hitchens, Noam-Freaking-Chompsky. (two people that are completely on the opposite end of the spectrum ideologically and in respective areas of study).
disagree then ? this is fine. 
it's the disingenuous nature of him painting the ideas of anyone he doesn't agree with as "Neo-Marxist Postmodernism" 
without debating any of them.
even if you agree 100% with someone, don't you want to see them challenged. isn't this the hole point of his books and speeches "enlightenment", "the seeking of truth" etc. 
Christopher Hitchens debated "classical marxists" and i enjoyed it was great. (insert LOL LOL LOL Marxist "rekt".)
if you want to play idolism games with modern thinkers, Christopher Hitchens could spank J Peterson if you shot up his dead corpse with adrenaline.
or wait is Christopher Hitchens a "neo-marxist postmodernist" now?

let me get this straight...
you are sarcastically calling me out as being a "nerd" or "bookworm".

you do realise the man writes books... right? 
not just "OBILTERATORZ BLUE HAIRED CUCKED LIBERALS" on youtube...

for most people it's because he is erroneously called a "Nazi" by progressives. 
for me it's because he rambles on about how bad it is to call people Nazi's erroneously (of which he has been accused of multiple times in error) and repeats how evil this is constantly.
he then goes on to suggest Richard D Wolff is spouting Nazi ideals... -.- (  )  after dodging a debate with him. 
I'm sorry but the man is so full of shit if you gave him a enema he would fit in a matchbox. 
I wasn't so vitriolic until i found out he dodges debates and is utterly hypocritical, a certain amount of hypocrisy i can forgive but not to this level.
he also bangs on about "truth" "enlightenment values" "western civilization" importance of debate etc. 
Rambles on about free speech and how it's good to debate tough topics(HAHAHA), so I'll bang on about him a pre-Copernican obscurantist until i turn blue.

"do you play the pokies?" (poker machines) 1/4 in Australians does that. 
if yes &gt; stop doing that and buy what you would in bitcoin per week. 
if no &gt; buy an amount that wouldn't hurt if you lost it on the bus, and get a wallet / backups first.

dudes a well read clinical psychologist, he knows squat about economics and political theory.
there isn't some big "leftist agenda" - proof ? - united workers parties are all but dead in most countries, Marxists and socialists are heavily fractured, they disagree and argue more than an old couple. Multiple economists and political researchers have called out his bullshit but everyone wants to just jerk off and give the Koch brothers another foot soilder.
maybe we should just get real - dig up Ayan Rand and jerk off to her decaying face because that seems to be the extent of proper discourse currently.
