Doesn't stop it being a problem 
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:43:17
I'm sorry but you're very lucky that the instant, zero fee coins don't have the same amount of traffic as BTC because that would be the day BTC was worth much much less.
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:07:07
Yeah, everyone involved would be dead instead.
Much better.

The future

"No altcoin does anything that Bitcoin cannot do." Oh come on people.

Where did you order from?

The snow will melt when BTC hits 8k mate 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:45:16
I'll have a look into it in more detail, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:53:08
I'm a hodler but how can we expect crypto to be the next big thing if this threat happens every so often?
170k unconfirmed transactions and extortionate fees because the miners have moved to Bitcoin Cash?
This doesn't sound like the decentralised utopia we all want. It doesn't bode well for the future...
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:33:51
Nope, but don't carry on with the whole decentralised spiel after this because from what I can see, we're all still puppets of a new system that's controlled by the wealthy few.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:40:41
To be honest I wanted to see if my thinking was rational and if anyone else had the same thoughts. But no, I only invested what I was prepared to lose so I'll never sell. 
I'll ride the storm and expect it to be fine but at the same time it's risen question marks over the whole system.
Would you agree?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:59:10
Bitstamp or localbitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:23:11
I dont understand your second statement.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:58:15
You don't know. I don't know.
However, I can't see it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:34:41
You need to look into WTC and realise not every alt is a currency. You're as bad as those who say Bitcoin will fail because it's a bubble.

The network of users came from being the first mover along with the businesses and exchanges.
I'm talking if we started out with no volume. Who would win?
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:55:56
Almost... They can't upgrade to be a DAG coin with no fee
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:03:07
More than triple what I originally invested in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:06:39
Yeah that's the one. You're thinking of IOTA though with that DAG statement though. Nano has no central authorities managing transactions on the network. The block lattice DAG structure they use is actually decentralised.
Please have a deeper look into Lightning, your decentralised argument will be all but gone. Large corporations will be owning those channels.
A coin that can be mined is also centralised in the fact that all that hash power is centralised.
We wanted to get away from the VISA world in which we pay them to spend OUR money yet here we are accepting it in another form just because we can't see the person we're paying.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:01:43
The funny thing is, if you laid out the pros and cons of each currency coin without the name attached, I can't see Bitcoin being anywhere near number 1.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:04:26
Get BTC to be 100% fee-less and near instant. Like under 4 seconds instant and I'll believe you.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:17:00
I'm not discrediting BTC but you can't ignore the other tech out there either.
The first mover in any industry will rule for a period of time but innovative tech usually takes over. This could be 1 year or 10 years from now.
The market share is dwindling each year and it's due to just that, the tech.
If I need to pay for my car that costs $30,000 or for a coffee that costs $4. I want to use the same currency. I want to not be charged a single cent. I want them to receive it instantly. I want to send $4 and them receive $4. Without the electricity costs. It's all out there right now.
In the hypothetical situation of starting over with no volume, I can't see BTC being top because of the above. Wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:11:42
Some of these coins have done network stress tests to show they can handle much more tx per second than BTC can.
Granted, there's a long way to go but just because BTC is number 1 now doesn't mean it always will be. No sector ever works like that.
I think for now BTC is where it rightfully should be. It's naive to think it can never be toppled with better tech.
Take Nano for example. Let's say it's 2 years from now and there hasn't been an attack. Volume is up 10-20x where it is now and there's been no hiccups.
It's decentralised
It's fee-less
It's eco friendly
It's instant
Are you telling me that this would have no chance to overtake BTC?
Putting BTC on an unreachable pedestal is now we got into this real world financial mess in the first place.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:55:06
Okay I get that... Doesn't relate to Nano though
