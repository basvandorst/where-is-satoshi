It would be nice that the winner sent the guy who lost 42 btc his money back
just saying, not participating

@_date: 2015-12-31 22:09:22
Oh, thank you :) nobody had given me tip before
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:58:54
Happy hodldays

If they wanted to, they could charge half for doing exactly the same they are doing now, and still make profit. They don't need bitcoin for that
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:55:37
Either do it or shut up
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:52:43
i hope so
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:30:06
just the way it is, though
@_date: 2014-09-27 14:45:43
You may want to contact support
I had a problem once and they solved it, but I contacted them like 20 times before getting a solution

"and trillions earned"
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:28:54
it's gonna go up
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:17:03
yeah, im scared too, not selling either
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:16:26
I think they did it on purpose to stop the crash
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:39:55
me too

Because of my comment there is no mainstream adoption, yes, that is exactly what I meant
@_date: 2016-03-19 00:11:16
If there is a button to do so you can. sometimes it only allows for refunds
@_date: 2016-03-19 16:26:15
Yes, it makes sense, I sold on ebay and got scammed like that. That is why i was telling you to refund. I lost 180 dollars that way
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:47:07
WTF are you talking about? 
If it were like you say, I'm sure your mother would have opted for an abortion
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:35:34
It is really stupid, if you think the price is going down, why not sell the 1000 btc?
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:56:57
Every three weeks somebody comes here saying they have trouble buying because it is really a hassle for newcomers with all the paperwork, id, etc, at exchanges; but you, you are frankly stupid, coming here insulting someone you don't even know, for stating something you didn't understand.
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:29:32
Oh, I fell for it...
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:49:00
By "this" I meant because it is hard to buy, anything else you might have understood is just a projection of you being a mongoloid. Maybe your mother didnt abort you because she was too a mongoloid to notice
@_date: 2016-01-22 07:57:24
This is why there is no mainstream adoption. Every three weeks
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:41:50
Return the money to him
@_date: 2016-01-01 11:53:35
Yep, so be it
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:36:30
I am not for this pattern thing, but i agree the sentiment is like it was in the 30s. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:30:16
The law of china, which i whatever the chinese want it to be
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:54:11

Does anybody remember when the Dorian story came out that Satoshi (supposedly) posted "I am not Dorian Nakamoto"? So he did have access to that account
