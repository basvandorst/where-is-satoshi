Yes but I wait for the right moment to use the dip to buy some btc 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:40
so many action today about the BTC...
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:16:56
The Bitcoin Chart is at 15k that‘s a big dip or no?
Will it Fall lower or should I use my bit4coin voucher now? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:10:48
When you look on the Chart (I use Kraken.com) you can see the dip at this moment is not the smallest &amp; i think after this the btc will go high like always 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:55
Anyone an idea why the spread between Kraken and other sides is so big? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:20:31
Ok Not „the end“ but maybe the beginning of it?
In a Slow way but a 10% drop is much for the Bitcoin and the chart is in -  since 2 Days

Not really new I trade with bitcoins since 2014...yes fuck my life that I don’t invest at the time...but now I wanted to make a little bit money with it and the chart is falling and many news site‘s report that many people thinks it will falling down up to 50 percent 
From 0 to 17k wasn’t soo far for btc maybe from now 13,9K (€) to 0 the way is also so far?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:56:08
I think the dip is kraken‘s fault, maybe when the site is back again the prices will shoot out back again 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:11:52

Nothing Special I just beg 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:22:32
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:55:54
I think it will fall lower because the rumor and panic about the btc is now very big. Many people will sell it now in panic and this will let fall it for a time 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:46:19
