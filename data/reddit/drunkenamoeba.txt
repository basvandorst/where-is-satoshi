Sure, but it was an *exchange*, or the only place where you can exchange bitcoins for USD or other real-life, trade-able currency. My original comment stands. If something called an "exchange" can't be trusted, then this is never going to take off as mainstream. 
Again, it's not like these people were storing money in the silk road. If a bitcoin exchange can't be seen as trustworthy, then how can you ever expect people to find long-term confidence in the currency?

Speculators. Not investors.

Most bitcoin enthusiasts want bitcoin usage and acceptance to expand (most of them just so the value of their coins increases). It's never going to happen. It's never going to be more than just a niche currency for the technically well-off. Why? The average response to the Gox issue has been "well, that was their fault for not knowing Gox was going to buckle." The average person is never going to be okay with this. Most of us have no idea what goes on behind the walls of a bank - we just know and expect our full account balance to be there when we need it. 
Bitcoin is going to continue to suffer through all of the problems of an unregulated "free market." There is a reason things like the FDIC exist.

Fear. In an unregulated market, shit happens. This is what the people asked for, and they are going to get all that comes with it - good and bad.
