Don't forget the official exchange rate in Argentina is bogus.  It's 13.5 pesos per dollar or 1 BTC is 3278 pesos.   So 48 pesos is. 0.01464 BTC or $3.55.  You can't buy BTC in Argentina for official exchange rate. So using BTC is same as USD and price is much better.

This is Argentine pesos:
1 Argentine Peso = 0.07 USD 
The official government rates are fixed by the government, you can't exchange ARS for USD at government rate. You have to use the black market prices.

You can easily sell your pesos for dollars at blue Tate or Bitcoin. That isn't an issue.  People here buy and sell dollars with pesos all the time. The same with bitcoin. You can buy and sell bitcoin with pesos at dollar blue or USD. Just forget about official exchange rates that number is totally made up. Bring dollars get pesos. Dump your pesos for dollar when you leave.

Could you have used a service like Expensify?  They can generate an invoice to be paid in local currency through bank or CC but convert it to bitcoin for you.   
Seems the easiest solution is not to have clients think about paying it bitcoin or signing up for a new service but to just pay as normal without knowing its being converted to bitcoin.  
Of course there is a fee and possible delay in the payment but its probably equivalent to offering a client a discount.

True LBC creates a new address each time you receive bitcoins. I'm not sure its a requirement that they provide bitcoin volume and length of account. This seems to just be part of their trust system. Do you know which regulation would require this information and which country?  Hopefully they don't have a way to track LBC addresses other than same username. Even same username is a bit if a coincidence and hard to prove without some knowledge of which address on LBC is associated with which username.

As a trader I could send bitcoin from several sources to my LBC wallet. None of which were from Coinbase.  So Coinbase isn't breaking any laws by selling to me. Unless now they are some type of internet sleuths routing out all P2P traders for the good of society and the children.  Either it didn't happen or Coinbase is extremely over zealous in their tracing where coins might go.

The price of bitcoin in Argentina is actually the same as most exchanges when using LocalBitcoins.  Its extremely competitive here and most of the time you can buy bitcoin below market. Just be aware dollars/BTC/ARS are converted at the dollar blue price. Check a site like bluelytics.com.ar for rates.  Some people are getting the math completely wrong when converting bitcoin prices to dollars on LocalBitcoins in Argentina. /iwantathink is 100% correct about everything.  
Now having said that let me say what a complete mess it is to buy and sell cars here.  Its a huge hassle plus you need a license here to drive one.  Taxis and buses are far cheaper and less complex than what you're planning. If you must buy and sell a car just do it in dollars and with a local that you can trust and plan a block of time to do all the paper work.

I will reiterate, without use holding doesn't in itself provide value to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:01:16
What's strange is the IRS treats it like am investment but people are making purchases with their BTC. You normally don't buy stuff with stocks it wouldn't make any sense. But bitcoin can easily be used (and more likely) for purchasing.  
Its not really an investment tool and should never have been classified as such. However everyone is speculating on the prices and waiting for the moon landing.  Well the fuel that gets bitcoin to the moon is use as a currency.
I agree with OP the US has made it harder to use BTC because of regulations and classifications. You're really left with a choice, don't report purchases or hold forever.  
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:04:13
Its already a scarce commodity by design. The only thing holding is doing is creating false bubbles. It should be used and value comes from its use both buying and selling to increase demand.  The whole exchange, hold, investment path isn't a value to bitcoin and not its intended use.

The price difference depends on location. Some areas have greater competition and prices are closely matching market.  LBC also charges a slightly higher service fee of 1% which account for some of the price bump, the rest seems like gauging.
@_date: 2014-12-30 10:12:38
I use LBC and I do know how it works. My point is that LBC is choosing to post publicly the number of trades and the number of BTC sold (both in a range) along with lenght of trading time.  
They also include feedback.  LBC isn't required to post that information by any law or regulations as you previously stated. They could just use feedback scores instead of choosing to display 100+ trades or 150+ BTC on a users public profile.
@_date: 2014-12-14 01:37:12
Yes absolutely go check LocalBitcoins now for Buenos Aires.  Be sure to convert pesos at dollar blue value.  BTC has the same price ad USD in Argentina.  Buying BTC with USD or ARS fetches the same price. The price is close to or below Bitstamp price.

Look at Mycelium Local Trader. They have a rating system that excludes posing number of BTC and number of trades.  By showing the trade stats LBC has exposed the privacy of traders.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:58:41
Your argument is adoption and use benefits bitcoin less than holding. If everyone was holding bitcoin wouldn't have any value.  You have to echange it or barter it to make it worth something.  You can have adoption and use without holding but you get nothing from holding without adoption and use.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:13:10
I'm still finding it hard to believe without tracing the actual bitcoin how they determined the bitcoin purchased at Coinbase made it to LocalBitcoins and under the same person. Without proof they are basically policing the internet based on matching usernames and assuming that the source of the traders coins were from Coinbase.  Seems like a big stretch unless they have some additional information to support their claim.

Developers who work for large companies can donate immensely to open source projects. Just look at all Square has done by open sourcing their code and contributing to other projects. 
The arguments that there is a conflict of interest by either Galvin or Blockstream is ridiculous without real evidence. And that evidence must pass an extremely high bar to be legitimate.   
So far all I see are unsubstantiated paranoid statements. Developers can also hold their own opinions different than those of the investors. 
Developers of any caliber are not beholden to VCs because of money that may or may not come. They don't have to be that desperate, they can work anywhere.
To piss off developers means you lose your investment, the very resources that you are counting in to create real value for your company.  To think otherwise is just lack of knowledge how silicone valley and startups work.  There is a lack of takent and nobody is pushing developers to subvert an open source project to dismantle Bitcoin.

I agree it should be mentioned and it's obviously well known to everyone.  What should also be said is that those saying the conflict is part of a bigger conspiracy to take down Bitcoin must be provide indisputable evidence of that fact.  The onus is on them to offer proof and not just post hit pieces about any of the Core contributors past or present. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:40:16
Really, reaching all the way back to the Greeks?  OK let's make it simple. Core members, listen up, anyone without a perceived conflict of interests please step forward, all others are dismissed from the project. Nobody steps forward.  Project dead. That's your position.
@_date: 2016-03-16 08:01:29
Everyone has a conflict if interest that works on Core because they all probably either work on other Bitcoin products or hold Bitcoin and therefore have a vested interest in its future.  If that is your litmus test for being able to contribute to Core then we'd be fresh out of developers. 
It's not possible to debate if the bar to accuse someone of manipulation of Bitcoin code to their advantage is simple because they have a conflict of interest. You need proof and damn solid proof that they are actually doing harm intentionally against Bitcoin because of that conflict.
So far I only see wild and unfounded accusations without evidence of wrong doing.  How should one debate someone else if that person believes that any conflict of interest equates evil doings simply because a conflict exists. That is why this kind of rhetoric is so poisonous, because it's based on nothing yet because people hear "conflict of interest" they buy the shit being shoveled.

LocalBitcoins is also a wallet so just sending bitcoin to LBC doesn't mean anything. It's also perfectly legal to buy/sell bitcoin P2P. Some may even have license to do so in their state.
It seems likely that Coinbase would first have to prove you were not just using LBC as your wallet and in fact selling bitcoin. They would then have to prove that your account sold a sufficient amount of bitcoin over a certain time period to be considered a MSB and of course that you weren't doing so legally (which I assume they would ask first before shutting down your account).
Unfortunately LBC makes this very simple by posting  trade information to a persons public account page.  It shows length of account and volume like 100+ trades.  What it doesn't show is the price and time of each sale.  Volume and time alone don't make you a MSB, its the amount of the transaction and total of those transactions over time. If I sold all my BTC 2 years ago that has a different price point than last week.
Coinbase had to do some guessing as to how much the person was moving and the price.  Most likely they are only concerned with the volume of bitcoin transactions.  Seeing a LBC account wallet with 150+ transactions may be a red flag for them.
LBC could address this by not posting publicly user volume and time.  They could also insure that addressees are always new or that coins are mixed internally to stop tracking. LBC users could also create new or multiple accounts before volume gets too high.
It should be up to individuals to be reporting their loss or gains and require proper licensing if needed. It shouldn't be Coinbase just doing CYA and trailing users in this way. It seems like an invasion of privacy. Certainly above what my bank does when I withdraw cash from my ATM.  The downside of BTC is also it's plus, the public ledger.
Edit: I would add also that Coinbase has to prove that the coins purchased from them were the ones from your LBC wallet used for trading.  Since you could have received bitcoin from other sources as well.  Guilt by wallet address association seems to be what they are doing.  Far too over zealous.
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:37:36


This is unsubstantiated. There is no proof that the conflict (those working on Bitcoin and also employed by another company working on Bitcoin products).  
Just as there is no proof that Square is "evil" by working on and contributing to open source Android projects because Square and Google also have competing payment applications.   This is where the "conspiracy" starts and the facts fade.  Unless you have a proof that they are not acting in the best interest of Bitcoin, then the conflict isn't a real worry.  
What you are suggesting, as well as many others is, simply by being paid to work on a Bitcoin product, any contributions to Core are therefore ensync with that product.   You're also suggesting that hobbling Bitcoin is somehow a benefit to their product and they are willing to take that risk.  
What's easier to believe, they are contributing with the best intentions to Core or they are some part of a secret conspiracy to hobble Bitcoin so they can gain the rewards later with great risk to their own business.

The level of proof should currently being applied is "developer X is working for company Z, they have VC $$$, they must be evil and trying to kill Bitcoin".  That kind of crap is being shoveled all over these forums.  It's just not reality, the reality is probably so much less sensational.

If an application is using the LBC API they must ask for permission to send money during the Oauth2 authentication. Local Trader asks to send money with your LBC pin code, which is something you setup as part of your LocalBitcoins registration.  The PIN code is required to release or send money.
Currently, the LBC API does not use 2FA to release trades or send money. It uses secure tokens and the pin code.  I suspect OP had installed an application that just wrapped the LBC website and stole his credentials.

There are many posts on this sub speculating the number of hops but it's definitely happening.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:38:28
This is kind of the default response given to defend the actions of Coinbase. Coinbase is tracking up to three hops from your purchase of BTC. I don't know if this is KYC or not since its not comparable to currency.   Are they doing this because they have to or because they can?  Are they fighting it to protect privacy?  I don't know of it can just be said KYC and end of story. My feeling is they are intentionally doing extra tracing of Bitcoin after it leaves their site that may not be necessary. They so plenty enough when it comes to verifying accounts. I just think they are going the extra mile to track users instead of working to increase user privacy. What I do with my BTC, like cash I withdraw from a bank should be my business.
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:20:30
So how many hops do regular exchanges have to follow the dollars when you cash out.  They aren't exactly Apple when it comes to fighting for privacy against the government and go a hell of a lot farther than any bank in tracking users use if the BTC purchased. Are they actually regulated more or just more willing to go the extra mile to track users.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:41:55
Why can we ask Coinbase to be more responsible in protecting us from the overbearing govt instead of giving them a pass because KYC.  They have a ton of money and say they are part of the BTC community. Privacy is one area where I think all members of the BTC community feel could be increased. Hey Coinbase step up like Apple and start fighting back a little.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:05:33
That doesn't mean a company has to follow your trail after you move your BTC. Coinbase actively follows the BTC for the government. Maybe it's some requirement because BTC can be traced easier than money or maybe they do it out of the blindness of their heart. But they sure as hell don't try to deny or fight it. They say they are supporting the Bitcoin community but they looked more like they are supporting the govt.
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:23:12

This is definitely a recurring topic. Coinbase and now Circle tracking down users who sell bitcoin on LBC. 
LBC changes addresses on your account every deposit.  So how would they be tracking addresses associated with LBC.  None of thise addresses are publicly available.
So they might track user names for publicly listed advertisements but that's not always conclusive.  So even if they connected your user name at Coinbase to LBC that doesn't mean you've breaking the law.
A money transmitter's license isn't required in all states and not in all countries.  So why would they be asking users to provide a license. Its sort if up to state regulations and the person to sort those out.
Everyone is always quick to blame the person getting the account frozen because its assumed they are breaking the law. But do we know definitively ithat all states are requiring those selling and buying Bitcoin to even be licensed?
I would like to see the actual proof of how Coinbase is connecting their users to the actions of those on LBC and what criteria they are using to determine the activities require a license.  I feel like someone is sleuthing for them and directing who to freeze or not.
Coinbase certainly seems to be going well beyond what they need to do for KYC and stalking users across the web for money transmitter activities.  Someone please ask for proof of the crime from Coinbase or Circle.  
Unless they are under some type if gag I can't see why they can't be up front about how they came to the conclusion someone was a money transmitter without a license.
@_date: 2015-11-19 13:14:57
I think the only effective thing they could do is clamp down on the local trade (LBC) since exchanges are already heavily regulated.   Next up "blacklists needed" to taint the Bitcoin from certain regions or accounts.  
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:38:40
That is the first sensible information I have heard. I wonder why Coinbase cares so much about outing possible violators, wouldn't that be tipping them off.  It also shouldn't be up to Coinbase to question if someone is registered or not by providing proof. Sounds a lot like the government has a hand in this.
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:18:31
I think technically Rebit doesn't have to have a money transmitter license in any part of the US as long as they are not advertising their services to US citizens.  
Coinbase allowing their customers to send BTC to another service which operates a money exchange or money transmission may be the gray area.
I don't know of Dodd Frank applies to services outside the US that happen to be used by US citizens. Again I think as long as the service isn't targeting US citizens it may be in the clear.
What's interesting to me is how far Bitpay policy goes to ensure non of their merchants are exchanges or money transmitters but Coinbase seems to not have those restrictions or is ignoring them in this case.
For me I want some definitive answer on these questions as remittance is a good use case for BTC.
@_date: 2015-02-20 07:22:23
I've read other posts where Coinbase has shut down user accounts for selling bitcoin on sites such as LocalBitcoins because of money transmission regulations.  
However Coinbase is seemingly supporting such action in the Philippines.  Allowing users to buy BTC with USD and sending it using Rebit for local fiat.  Does Rebit have a license for transmitting money within the US as required by businesses such as Western Union.  
Is it somehow unneeded because Rebit is located outside the US or the transaction is done with BTC?  Are Coinbase users at risk of having their accounts shut down for using Rebit? Doesn't this bypass KYC rules because Rebit is dispensing local fiat to customers but the sender isn't a money transmitter?
@_date: 2015-02-20 08:05:32
It looks as though accepting payments for services like Rebit is specifically not allowed by Bitpay because of regulations. Bitpay prohibits the use of their service for any merchants that "are associated with Money Service Business activities, as defined by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury".  This includes money or currency exchanges.
I think Coinbase has the same restrictions but yet its promoting the use if such a service. I'm not saying its a bad thing but I want some clarification. Does Coinbase like Bitpay have policies prohibiting the use of their services by those associated with money transmission or exchange of currency?
Can a company use Coinbase services as a means to accept BTC for currency exchange or money transmission (remittance) or is it restricted as Bitpay is because of US law?

I sort of call bullshit on this answer as before Mt.Gox stopped dealing in USD deposits/withdrawls you could easily figure out the price based off the Mt. Gox index.  They were clearly pegging prices against Mt.Gox and not other indexes or their own stash of coins.  Also, the whole we average the index prices never worked out mathematically as their price was always matching the Mt. Gox index.  
The other indexes were at least 10% lower than Mt.Gox but Coinbase never lowered the prices.  This answer on the Coinbase support is corporate speak for we use Mt.Gox (at the time).  Now they just seem to be making up the price as they go.  But its definitely not as low as averaging all the current indexes (minus Mt.Gox).
@_date: 2013-06-29 13:59:09
Yeah I am using the API and know the price to pay.  I want to know how to set the price using something like LocalBitcoins.com.  I used to be able to work out the formula pretty easily using Mt.Gox price * 1.01 + .15.  But now I can't determine the price using a set formula.  They have to be using one of the other indexes which are all pretty standard prices, but seem to be charging 6% fees now. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 22:01:09
Now I am using Mt.Gox price because it seems to match the Coinbase price, though Coinbase usually has a small advantage.

But for buying at the price they are offering they must assume their product is for the general public who doesn't follow the different indexes.  They are offering more vendor services as well.   I hadn't thought about the premium sale price, that is a good point.

I suspect you are right.  But then if they are already adding in a bigger margin for BTC sales, why do they also tack on a 1% commission fee on top of it?  Shouldn't they just be calculating that into the price.  Feels like double dipping to me.  Like a tax on top of the already inflated index price.   They could also be more transparent about pricing.  Like hey we buy from Bitstamp and charge you 6%, but its not that clear what they are doing to set prices.  I know they are saying we also buy/sell from our own users, but cmon... 6% commission on top of the current index is a stretch.... 
@_date: 2013-06-29 14:49:07

The API doesn't hook to local selling sites like LocalBitocins.  You use formulas which are linked to the main indexes for pricing.  It's not a question of getting the price, its a questions of figuring out the price when you don't have the ability to integrate with the API.   However, for just viewing the price on refresh you can use this method.  I also created an Android application that views the price and allows you to buy from Coinbase, it has an auto refresh:
As well as the official Coinbase Android application which allows you to both buy and sell plus get updated prices:
