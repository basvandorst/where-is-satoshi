But they don't have to report the 4 billion laundered for drug dealers or billions for Bernie Madoff? I agree with what you are saying, but the reason they are required is because of the times THEY messed up, not us. They are crooks. Rules for thee but not for me.

Should have gotten in when we all did, @ &lt;$20.... Loser! Hahaha
Seriously just kidding. We were all there once , just set your goals and work towards them. We all want millions of dollars now. But we have to work hard to get there. Be vigilant, keep saving, and just remember - the really expensive (insert trendy item here) isn't as important as you think it is and won't be worth as much as it's current equivalent to btc in 5-10 years. Wish someone told me that when I was burning through cash at 16 buying iPods, pads, beats, Alienware laptops etc etc. It's all useless dick now in the bottom  of a land fill somewhere.

Ok, now I def know you work for the bank. You sick bastard. Actually my local bank is bank of America and they ARE THE ONE that got caught red handed laundering money for him and many others now they treat their customers like criminals because they were altering swift transfer and the like that were knowingly on the "do not do business with" list..... You should get your facts straight if you are going to shill for the banks. We can smell your kind from a mile away. Filth of the Earth. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 06:54:10
Yup, that's exactly what a piece of shit bank cock smoker would say. Paranoia =/= real presented facts. All my claims are on open to public lawsuits against banks. Keep shilling for banks, financial sector, whoever is paying for you to be a reality denying douche canoe.

Why can't this be asked in the daily? Does this really add anything of substance to this space? I actually hope it goes to $1700 a few times to screw people over that are only worried about the price. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:47:06
Fuck off with your false information. There is zero evidence for your claim. They are not taxing coffee purchases,buddy. They are taxing the $200,000 house you bought that only cost you $14 in 2011. People like you are why this world fucking blows.

HUH? I am black, how can I make "racist" comments. Personal attacks yes, Ill give you that. This is a throw away account I love attacking people with, but racist, you are a fucking moron. 
No, i will not apologize, The government will not come after you for buying $500 in coffee through the year with bitcoin and not claiming it. It's called scare tactics, and your pussy ass fell for it.

If you leave your keys to your Ferrari on your dining room table, and you have a shitty lock on your front door, there is a high chance your Ferrari will get stolen. What's your point? 
Likewise if you leave your word key in a place a "snooping teenager" can find it, you are doing it wrong and don't deserve the security you so seek.

Stop spreading fear to fit your agenda. I am on my third audit this year. (small business owner) IRS is rational and direct in what they ask. You are an obvious tax lawyer shill. Business is slow and you are trying to drum up fear. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:49:14
Huh, Redditor for a day making crazy claims of price prediction. Nope, no one is trying to manipulate the price a certain way. Funny thing is when you see the price go way up, there aren't as many one day accounts claiming $40,000 btc. So strange.

You don't DO anything. You just "think" you "invest" intelligently, even though as soon as there is a hint of a CEO farting during a conference call you sell everything you own and it drops 20%.

It is pretty easy. Each site has a "depth," take the number you think they will sell, look at depth... Bam you have the price... It isn't rocket science, and he is mostly right. Unless they dump it below market, which is a reckless thing to do, considering it is not his money and should be doing slow sells to sustain a higher return.

Well, I obviously wasn't trying to answer that part of his question directly, now was I, cool guy. 
Obviously it's validity as a global payment network to cut out a middle man, speed, and cost are all reflections of people, like myself, buying and not selling. There are only 4 million left. My answer is acceptable in the since of thinking outside the box. Which seems a stretch for you. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:03:40

@_date: 2018-08-02 18:25:05
You are either mistaken or overly protective. I sold my 1994 rx7 for 44k and didn't have to report it. You have to show seasoned money to the bank because they are crooks, nothing to do with money laundering. That is their money laundering laws, not federal or locals laws. They are doing that because after the crash, rich people were laundering money through poor poeple to buy houses and get the 7000$ first time home buyer credit....
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:26:34
You must be new here? That is far from the truth, "a lot" more demand is buying for future speculation. Coinbase has required verification since day one. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:56:59
I remember two years ago when it was $140 people sold and said it would take 5 to 10 years to reach $1000 again. I would tell you to ask those people, but they fucking killed themselves. Just sayin. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:39:53
This will only affect law abiding citizens. Criminals, gangs, and drug cartels not affected. Business as usual. Leave it to corrupt governments to turn innocent people into criminals. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 00:58:49
It sounds like you are focusing your energy on the wrong thing. You are either ill informed or just pro-troll. You don't have to use Coinbase at all. I trade locally on a weekly basis. Some times I buy, sometimes i sell. Never once had to give ID with my local guy. You have decided to take a decentralized asset and trade in on a centralized exchange. That comes with rules to combat money laudering. Rules that were put in place by the same people that are professional money launderers. Crooks hate competition. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:13:23
Yup, Confirmed, you are a glass half full kind of guy. Choosing set chart times to reinforce your preposterous claim. You know this time last year Bitcoin was $1700 right? YOY we are more than 4x the value. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:04:08
Uh oh semantics police. Better get my chart out. Ok, since you obviously weren't around 3 years ago, It dropped to 162 on most exchanges but some it hit even lower. I messed up and said two years. Should have said 3, my bad. But, regardless. Even when it was 450 exactly to the day two years ago people were still sayin, " Nawwww man sell it, this ain't going to 1000 in, like, years brah. I mean it was only used for drugs and thats done sooooo, derrp"
Not sure where you are from, but where I'm from I can say whatever the fuck I want, as long as I don't incite violence or take away anyone else's rights. So calling me a horrible person just makes you a moron. 
And jokes aside, people did, in fact, kill themselves because they sold/lost/got hacked/or wasted it on molly water. So although my facts hit you right in the feels, they are still facts. So, unless you bought at 19891...... or unless you invested your moms meth money, just hold. History shows you will have to wait no more than 2 years to break even.  
Not laughing at a well thought out insertion of people killing themselves makes you a pussy.  
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:43:08
Yes, good job. Now comprehend what you are reading. No where in that link does it say what you are proposing. The code is what keeps it secure. The mining just verifying it. Now if they were changing the transactions, there would be a fork. Other miners would notice and join the new, correct,chain. How is that hard to understand? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:53:06
"probably" on a pie chart is far from "evidence-based" analysis. Get lost. You a) don't understand what a 51,% attack is, and b) offer no proof that the "code" is compromised. Show us on GitHub where the code has a flaw in it that comes from bitmain changing something.

Yay, I have followers. You really are a sad person. All because you don't know what depth is on an exchange. Poor guy. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:50:32
I think you should brush on your terms. Depth is the orders on the books. If someone "dumps" 8000 btc on one exchange, you can see what price would equate to such a sale. It would of course cause other people to dump, but as I said, it would only take the price down. 1000 dollars if it was one exchange. The volume is important because you can see the average trade daily is 100k btc..... So that would only be roughly 10% of daily volume. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:18:28
Amen brother
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:10:45
Yup, absolutely no doubt you are an absolute fucking moron. Transactions have no direct link to price. If you were right, the price would have been growing in 2014 and 2015 when the price was mostly stagnant. 
Two words, professional troll. Zoom out. 
edit- By your estimation for direct link of transactions to price, we are at transactions levels when the price was $400-$1200 so we should be at that level again....
