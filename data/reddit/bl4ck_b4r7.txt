Most systems are not evil. Some People are. That's why we need a trust-less system. That's the novel capability the Blockchain brings that cant be duplicated or replaced with current technology or philosophy. That makes Bitcoin a resource just like gold or grain and makes spending resources to acquire it just as rational as mining gold and farming grain.

Transaction volume has absolutely no correlation to hash rate. Proof of work is the only way we have a blockchain that is provably fair for all participants. Proof of stake is for company's not open source software.

I dont belive Blockchain.info has "Off-chain" transactions. Any transaction you make should propagate just as fast as any other.  The issue could come from your other wallet not updating as fast but if its not done off-chain its all the same Blockchain no matter what wallet you use.

Seriously!? That sucks.... FREE CHARLIE SHREM!!!
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:43:43
The point is you cant have one without the other. Take the "Dumb Data" out and the whole thing collapses into nothing more than a convoluted spreadsheet. The current blockchain is run by people who have incentive to keep it going &amp; your so called dumb data is the lifeblood of what makes the whole thing work in the first place. Without incentives miners wont mine and the network cannot be trusted to be secure.

Yeah I just thought it would be funny to say. I don't think this post has any ill intent.

We desperately need an Ambassador not a "Bitcoin Jesus" as some have taken to calling (a misconception by some, confusing him with roger ver). I am posting this to point that out and to start a discussion to try and come up with a better more "Official" name for him. (he would have destroyed at this hearing:P) I would wager I speak for most of us in saying when Ambassador-Antonopolos is out there representing Bitcoin he says exactly what is on everyones mind and represents the community and its values well. He deserves a better name so Ambassador-Antonopolos...... THANK YOU!

This is an awesome idea. Bitcoin honeypots for malware detection is simple and smart!

Remove bitcoin from that statement and find a verb in the dictionary that doesn't fit. That's why it matters to be specific. Otherwise everything just boils down to the speed of light.


Its not a flaw If there is no other way to do it.

Again even you comment falls into the synchronicity. I was speaking with my wife about Hall when the IBC went viral. She stopped me mid sentence and said "Who the hell is Hal Finney?" "You were just talking about him like I should know who he is..."  strange man.... Strange.
@_date: 2014-04-12 14:35:05
 The "Value" has no correlation to hash rate either. Mining exists independently of Bitcoin the "currency". Sure mining will use more resources over time as the network grows but that's stating the obvious.
People who think mining is wasting energy by doing proof of work don't understand why it is needed or the function it serves.

@_date: 2014-09-25 15:10:13
Nope thats just to buy. look for a receive option and they will give you an address that you can tell change tip to send the $5 too. altho coinbase isn't an ideal place to store your coins. Defiantly set up 2 factor authentication if you do. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:57:23
Your not understanding the difference between direct and indirect causes. Just because 2 factors meet up at some point doesn't mean they are directly related. Regardless, whats your point if you don't have a better solution to suggest. We are a resource based culture and will do what we need to to acquire said resource. This digital one is no different.

No just gave you $5. Click on the collect button to claim it. For your other question about public/private they are both part of the same thing (your wallet). Think of it like an email address the public key is like your address (XXX and your private key is like your password and lets you have access to your coins. You can give anyone your public key (Your address) but do every thing possible to keep your private key (Password) private. I recommend Blockchain.info for a first time wallet and coinbase or localbitcoins to buy BTC.

What makes the blockchain work? Distributed consensus! What makes Distributed consensus work? Miners! Why do miners mine? Seigniorage! Profit motive is the only reason Blockchain technology woks in the first place. Sure you can copy the code but the code is just a framework the actual thing that makes it work are the people that run the code.
