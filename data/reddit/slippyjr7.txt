An investment. I'm not really using them. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:01:40
I'm planning on backing it up to Google Drive.  I should encrypt it right?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:22:07
Ok thanks for the explanation! It makes more sense now- I'm transferring my btc to breadwallet right now 
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:21:43
Btc mining isn't profitable anymore what is this sorcery 
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:37:21
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:05:15
How is that if it's encrypted?
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:29:28
It looks like this is safest option- as soon as I buy another hdd I'll run a full node. Thanks for the info 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:52:41
Coinbase would probably work
@_date: 2017-03-23 14:30:42
Thank you very much for this information.  My money is in a much safer place now
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:32:05
What difference does that make though?
I trust Coinbase make than me forgetting my password or my computer crashing or something. 
I don't really understand the fork- will my btc lose value of its in Coinbase vs my own wallet?

I don't have 125 gb if free space right now but I'm planning on buying a new hdd soon. What's the point of running a node?
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:37:52
Wow that's pretty sick- I'm probably just gonna write it down on a piece of paper and laminate it or something though
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:48:17
How do I know if I can run a full node? I have a computer
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:38:04
I want to save it because it'll go up. I just need to wait, right?
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:01:19
I freed up some space yesterday and I have like 1 more day until it's done downloading. My bitcoins will be safe if I love them to Bitcoin-qt?
Edit: i was doing some research and Electrum also looks good.  Is that any better than a full node&gt;
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:22:31
I'm gonna start using breadwallet
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:51:02
I'm on Windows 8 but that's still really unsettling 
@_date: 2017-03-28 01:43:01
You can try localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:46:48
I think Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:05:39
Why shouldn't Bitcoin be taxed? If people are going to use it as real money the government should treat it as real money as well 
@_date: 2017-01-17 19:25:13
Good point 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:16:34
The fees are smaller 
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:16:24
I'm in the US. Do I still need tier 3?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:25:49
Why would you rather buy from me than a trusted site??
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:21:13
No offense but I don't feel comfortable selling to a random person on the internet. I don't know enough about this to be 100% sure I'm doing it safely 
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:38:57
1 btc- maybe less
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:08:09
What bad news
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:32:43
Yep pretty much 
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:08:38
The laziest and easiest way to get info from strangers on the internet is asking for it not doing the work
