@_date: 2014-03-04 13:05:12
what I generally do is watermark my own details with some bold and clearly visible writing onto of all documents. I know it's not 100% secure but every little helps right? 
I have found though that Kraken didn't like this for some strange reason.
found an example of how I do it (no not me lol)

I might not know all the answers but a few points:
The beta was launched around this time last year. Several 100s of BTC were given as rewards for reporting bugs in their beta system. No real BTC was traded at the time. I believe Kraken opened the door back in August and has been growing ever since. (I sound like a sales person haha)
Regarding the legal gargain, I have no idea.
Fees start at at 0.20&amp; and lower the more you trade.

If you are planning on having this in cold storage (paper wallet only) then I would suggest that you follow the guidelines on the right. 
 (see paper wallet section)
if you are planning on keeping the bitcoins on the address that you have generated via blockchain then please, please, please add a 2 factor authenticator to it. While it's not ideal for super long term storage (if you change/lose your phone for example) it's quite handy for short to medium term storage.
lastly take backups, for paperwallets this could be simply taking a copy and story the public key at a trusted third party such as a bank's safe storage or a friend's safe.

-12% isn't as bad as the 85% drop we have at the bubble deflating.

@_date: 2013-11-15 09:25:45
Think of Bitcoin (the monies) as gold. When you buy gold you don't have to buy a gold bar but you can buy small gold chunks or even gold dust. The same applies to Bitcoin so you can buy smaller fraction of a full bitcoin. Up to 8 digits.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:26:29
Have you used Bitcoinfridge before? the website seems rushed but the whois information is quite close.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:54:52
It's not like bitcoin value is a stable investment either, not just because of lost/stolen details.
@_date: 2013-09-24 11:28:36
Don't invest what you can't afford to lose :) I have around £100 spare at the end of the month and spend £50 on XBT and the rest I put in my savings account.
I was going to put everything into XBT but not at the current price.

Also suppliers need to get on board.

So let me get this right. If I support Bitcoins I am basically supporting the collapse of the USA and possible resulting in the western world imploding. Civil war, World war, famine, diseases and millions of deaths...

lol yes I mean blockchain.info and not bitchain :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:39:10
it took me about 5 hours via an email to their support regarding another issue I had. 
I lost my mobile phone and thus my google auth so I had to think of all the accounts that were stored on there. To get the 2 factor removed I had to provide my details (statement and ID) which they also classed as verification.
probably not the right way to get yourself verified
@_date: 2013-08-29 12:28:11
I think what OP wants to know is, does bitpay "instantly pay" into a UK bank account.

If someone were to sell me gold jewelry I would not know if the jewelry is indeed made of gold to a degree that was advertised. As a layman I would not know how to test this and getting this checked would cost time and money.
Another plus for Bitcoins is the 0 chance of getting scammed out of "fake" coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:40:15

"1 year after you made them"
does this only apply to miners then?
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:16:58
If you want to sell them all then I would suggest you email the big exchanges directly. MtGOX, Bitstamp, etc to see if they have any big buyers lined up.
Next you will want to get legal advise to see what kind of challenges you might face. Believe me, for the profit you are making you will want to make sure everything is in order.
Thirdly talk to the buyer multiple times by phone, email and if possible in person.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:30:50

I believe that is the same reason why there are no exchanges in the UK
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:23:36
This will only work if the buyer says he never received the coins but in this case it wouldn't have worked since the buyer claimed he was hacked

1) get a refund
2) name and shame (with evidence obviously). 
3) give the vendor a chance to respond by providing them with a link to the thread. This is a valuable step everyone should take so that the vendor has a chance to explain them self.
@_date: 2013-06-07 16:50:16
Everytime I see suggestions like this I think back to the "EVE Cally scam"
you do not gain anything from storing your bitcoins with someone else.
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:49:25
Well if you look at bitcoins and compare them to gift vouchers then you should not get taxed on them. The tax is generally added to the product you exchange the voucher for so this *should* not apply.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:38:06
You can store your bitcoins where ever you want. I have a small amount on my phone - nothing much, maybe £20 or so.
I then have a paper wallet where I store most of my bitcoins. This backed up at several locations which I trust. 
then I have another small fund on my computer if I never need to top up my phone etc.
Generally I don't trust online wallets, even with 2-way authentication.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:43:17
how would hoarding bitcoins benefit the whole system? To get bicoin the attention it deserves we need to buy currency and spend it or those vendors who use bitcoins won't get any benefit from it and won't recommend this.
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:36:55
I read in another post that someone dumped a large amount and people panic sold hoping to get some cheaper coins while it dropped. (I tried and failed but only with about half btc)
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:40:00
Once you buy bitcoins and transfer them to another clean wallet they become anonymous again. The government, wherever you are, will not be able to proof that you are the holder of said wallet.
I, for one, have no issues with the governments checking my ident when purchasing btc.
Could just be that I'm too faithful.

@_date: 2013-05-28 09:17:07
One of your main arguments has to be to yourself first. You should never invest what you cannot afford to lose. I made a very small investment just before the boom and crash and got too greedy before I wanted to cash out. 
The next thing should be that you don't want to invest everything into one thing, meaning that if you parents to allow you to buy btc, that you do not go out and spend thousands of $ (if you cannot afford to lose it all).
You have to hope for the best but expect the worst.
In regards to convincing your parents: you could show them a price graph and explain to them the recent crash. This will hopefully show then that you are aware of the volatility of this new currency. 
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:19:37
$10-15 per year per domain. 
and most of the top level domains. com/net/org/co
If you do it retrospectively you will lose customer faith. Yes its not MtGox's fault however they should have expected phishing sites to pop up.

well giving them cash equal to the amount they send seems fair to me.
@_date: 2013-06-04 12:16:27
One way to make this more secure is to tell the buyer that you:
1) will create a new paper wallet for him
2) send half of it to his paypal registered address
3) email him the other half to his paypal registered email address. 
this way the buyer can't make the claim for "but I got hacked" and can be quite easily disputed. hacker would have had to have his email, paypal, ebay and be at the registered address to intercept a letter.

I'm buying BTC via  as it's cheaper than  but it takes longer to get verified.
You can use Bitpay in the UK but requires SEPA transfer, this shouldn't really be a problem for a freight agency who will most likely already deal with 30/90 day invoices (correct me if I'm wrong). The money into Bitpay can be confirmed straight away but the cashing out will take longer than when you use a UK based exchange.

@_date: 2013-05-01 14:32:37
Bitcoin is just a term used for the crypto currency.
It's not an actual coin as per say. so it can be divided into smaller fractions, similar to gold.
take gold dust for example: it still has a worth, can be smelted into a big gold bar if you have enough dust. Same with bitcoins. If you have 0.00000001 btc you can still theoretically spend it, or save it.

Bitstamp is quite reputable but I would not send a picture of my ID without sticking a big fat "BITSTAMP" across it. That way they won't be able to fake my ID, well not as easy.
To purchase from exchanges you will need to provide some form of identification as they are required to "know their customers". 
If this is not for you then I suggest localbitcoins. as the name suggest you meet someone in person but again this has some risks so take a friend or two to a public area.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:43:58
sorry that's a pet peeve of mine :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:45:57
what I meant was photo copy your ID and stick a watermark across it. That way if something does happen they won't be able to use your copy for fraudulent activities.
