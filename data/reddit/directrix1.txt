The exchange has the obligation to be secure. The thief is under no such obligation to not rob them. Also, there is always a non-zero probability that the thief is part of the exchange.

I made over 10 grand from mining my bitcoin. Anybody that thinks bitcoin is worth nothing can (guilt free) hand over their drug/prostitution/terrorist funding/worthless currency to me, and I'll go ahead and find worth where they thought there was none.

The fact that ignorant people still think their random fiat currency is worth any more than Bitcoin is absolutely hilarious. Bitcoins have an undetermined but known value. There are no unknowns in the equation for determining it's true value. Other currencies and people's understanding of this currency just haven't stabilized enough to indicate this in a consistent form in any other currency. USD, or any other currency, has a value that is completely at the whim of some mystery organization, like the Fed. Why do you brag about your ignorance? Why do you think this other system is somehow more legitimate than this when there is already plentiful evidence to the contrary?

BTW, a software bug wouldn't kill Bitcoin, but a mathematical revelation w/discrete logarithm or hash collisions could force them to rearchitect the client which would just mean a small matter of time before the system is resecured.

All currency has relative worth. This currency is still in its infancy, and its value will obviously fluctuate.

There is no inherent reason why Bitcoin will fail, and there most definitely is no reason to say it is doomed to fail. It is a burgeoning currency which becomes more resilient with usage. You have just: based your assumptions off a couple growing pains, said that the people who designed it couldn't possibly have designed something that takes into account our complex economy, and then outright declared how it is doomed to fail when you also likely do not understand this complex economy. Use your macroeconomics skillz to tell us why it will fail.

No, there will still be other exchanges.

Well, according to Jessy the hardest part is definitely not taking payments. It sounds like an industry that you either have to be extremely lucky and extremely smart (business smart, connect with right people, and tech smart) to get anywhere. The fact that she started up 6 businesses tells me it's definitely more the first one. Also, she does have a point about the fixed up front cost of getting a well designed site. You don't need a full time web dev, and it would be cost inefficient to have one.
@_date: 2011-05-08 15:53:54
No, I just have experience with using a high end GPU to mine, and I know approximately how often it pays out (not often enough mining on my own even). Also, why did you opt to do a multiple of it all? Why didn't you just do one?
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:14:07
No, people will just start finding markets where people can handle their security, and the market sites will have to take security seriously or no one will use them.

I think their first target will be Reddit usernames with Bitcoin in them.

You should be far more worried about something like that happening with your bank. I've researched this system enough to know how resilient it is.
@_date: 2011-06-20 23:55:34
Well, potentially. There is no set transaction fee to exchange it. You can sell Bitcoins in any way you want. Also, with cell phone integration of a well made Bitcoin client this will probably become far easier than credit cards even.
@_date: 2011-05-01 18:53:28
Unhealthy in what way? There is no artificial influence in the rate at which Bitcoins are calculated, why they are made, who they are going to. I don't know that it's particularly "healthy," but I know of no evidence to think to the contrary.

Wow. Just wow. Not only does he ignore what she says, he doesn't even understand what little she said that he did read. She was making fantastic business sense, and she was offering excellent and logically reasoned advice. That guy is a fucking idiot. On a side note, thanks to her I'll now have something to reply to all my nerdy friends who always try to get me to start up a porn site with them.

This is no different than any other website selling digital downloads for money. They are just going to take security seriously to instill confidence in them.

Yeah. I've never seen so many people completely miss the point of what she was saying. I mean she was dishing out advise that they could have learned from, worked with, and ended up providing a better service. Instead they labeled her a troll and apparently a fed hellbent on destroying his master plan for changing the dominant currency used for paying for porn! LOL
@_date: 2011-05-20 00:22:48
That's a realistic assumption. It doesn't necessarily translate into "existing miners will still rake in the money." That is just an temporary trait of Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2011-05-02 14:04:10
Except for all the people causing the swings.

How long did it take to show Dwolla's verify deposits in your account? I've been waiting for almost three days now. Also, did your deposit ever go through? I'm holding off using them until I can verify they are legit.

If they understand what Bitcoin is then they'd know you don't necessarily have it on you.

The free market was/is not impeded realistically. Sure private companies could have developed the tech (in fact they did a lot of it via contracts just like now), but private companies have this thing called profit motive. If its high risk, large investment, and long term then you can generally count the private sector out. We need government for science for the sake of science, because the private sector will rarely have the combination of will to go long with super high risk and the capital to follow that will at the same time. Just because the government is inefficient with some things does not make it unnecessary in others. Not everything can be contorted into a Libertarian ideal.

SpaceX is doing well because of government investment. Additionally, they are riding on technology that would not exist without a concerted, expensive, scientific, and very unprofitable initial engineering effort. You should thank NASA for developing this. Well, NASA and the military who let us use some of their tech to progress humanity instead of just kill parts of it.

You said that you paid off more debts, but then mentioned you have savings. Did you pay them all off, because otherwise what are you saving for (assuming interest on savings is less than interest on any debts)?

The current difficulty, reward for winning a block, ambient temperature, and my hardware configuration make it not worth my investment. It's an ASIC's world now.

I mined over 1500 BTC back in December of 2011. I was literally 10% of the network at the time. When it got up to $10/BTC, I sold. Friends don't let friends sell BTC.
EDIT: I guess I should say in a span of time ending December of 2011. It wasn't all in that month. I was just doing it because it heated my house up nicely and why not.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:40:02
I don't think it's a theoretical limit. I'm pretty sure it's just an arbitrary unit.
EDIT: Nevermind. You are correct in that it is a theoretical limit with the binary representation of transactions in the current protocol. I imagine this will be changing soon though.

Of course! It's just hard not wondering.
