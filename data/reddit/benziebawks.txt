You are just plain wrong.  I've seen at least 10 graphs that have squiggly lines dropping before going back up a bunch of times around this time of year in the past.  Factor in all the memes and it going up $500 in the past hour(recovery) I should have my lambo by the end of the month.  Bunch of newbs.

If you buy bitcoin through robinhood it is NOT your bitcoin.  You are simply placing a stake on the price, you cannot move it into a wallet.

I bought in two years ago so I'm still doing good, but I'll be honest, I've lost a lot of confidence in  the market.  How do you feel about the future of bitcoin and its price?  I feel like you'd have an insightful perspective.
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:53:28
Correct.  It is not censorship.  It is discrimination.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:53:22
I did.  Until one night I got high, watched some OMG BITCOIN IS A BUBBLE videos on YT and almost had a panic attack.  Now I have double my savings and will NEVER do that again.
*To clarify, I'm never putting my savings into crypto again.  I'm definitely getting high again.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:42:04
Maybe tell them that the bitcoin are on a hardware wallet locked in a safety deposit box.  Hopefully they'd give up after that... or begin to torture you endlessly.
@_date: 2018-09-07 16:11:35
Man, this is some great insight!  That is a great article as well.  I remember when Bitcoin hit $5k and I was blown away.  6 months later I was pissed off about the "crash" when it was still far beyond my wildest dreams from a year earlier.  Thank you for reminding me that this is a marathon and not about getting rich quick.  This truly revived my hope for Bitcoin.  Glad I asked!  Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:32:40
Nah, I enjoy receiving his snooty texts haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:54:20
I have a friend that will text me every time bitcoin "crashes".  Got a text from him the other day when it went below $10k.  Lol.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:31:59
I think they're missing a 0 haha
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:22
Yes, it's easy and fairly quick.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:10:53
Me too! "I don't know what it is, but it's the one from the link you sent me, right?" 
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:22:24
I didn't read the article, but one reason I could see is if I wanted to secure (and insure) a small amount of my crypto.  Let's say I have 5BTC (I wish), I could put 4 in cold storage and take the other 1 and put it into a crypto bank for day to day transactions.  Now, I understand that I could just do this myself with multiple wallets, but my parents on the other hand, have no idea or are too scared.
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:24:36

That's what the news says so it must be true!  No need to actually go listen to what he said.

EEEEVERYONE GETS A LAMBOOOOOOO!!!!
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:34:53
Yep, there's the censorship.  It's what happens when you are suspected of wrongthink in Silicon Valley.
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:43:47
Nah, it's cool.
@_date: 2018-09-22 00:28:56
Yeah but what happens when you are allowed to build and empire, then one day the rules get changed and suddenly your empire is wiped from existence? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:59:38
That is exactly it.  YouTube doesn't need their ad money.  If you go against the circlejerk, you get shut down.  Please look into it - YouTube demonetization &amp; social media censorship.  You are just as at risk as I am, regardless of your beliefs.
@_date: 2018-09-13 16:23:30

Oh I continue to invest in bitcoin, along with a few other cryptos.  I just wanted to make sure that IF it all comes crashing down (I don't think it will), at least I can still be on the up and up.
@_date: 2018-09-28 18:42:27
Yep, bought alts a few months back and they exploded!  Then, they imploded...a lot.  To the point where I'm pretty much a BTC purist.

I could be wrong here, but I think only USD is insured on Coinbase, not crypto assets.
*From their website:
"Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections."

@_date: 2018-05-14 17:10:10
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  Hopefully the event can push it over 10k and maybe we'll see some FOMO after.  I dunno...  I just want my lambo already.
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:48:12
Even better than a lambo, you got a fam...bo.  Congrats!

Watch multiple videos on YT on how to set it up.  Don't go in blind.  Also, MAKE SURE YOU ARE SETTING UP A FRESH SEED.  Scammers set up the seed and sell Nanos like they are new only to steal the crypto later, cuz.
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:16:33
I understand your concern - check my comment history.  But when you start conversations the way you did, it pushes people away from what you have to say.  Just food for thought.

That's a relief.  I always wondered what would happen if a transaction moved out of one of those wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-15 22:18:50
It's funny, a few years back I read about bitcoin.  Thought it would be a good investment so I bought some @ $800 and forgot about it.  About a year later HOLY SHIT $5,000!  Since then I can't go more than a few hours without checking the price.  I've tried to go back to forgetting about it, but I'm addicted.  Need them green candles, man.

What if he(?) is not though?  I invest in BTC, but I do wonder, what would happen if one of those wallets makes a single transaction?

Holy fuck that Newsweek article is cancer.  Completely takes President Trump's comments out of context.  I used to be a full on liberal.  Still am in some ways.  But once I realized how much the media is fucking lying and manipulating us, I pretty much have gone full Trumptard.

Nope, it's the entire media.  4AM Mocking Bird is a real thing.  Even Anthony Bourdain made a reference to it.  At 4AM the media receives their talking points.  Trump is achieving peace in the Korea peninsula?  *We can't be having that!*  So onto the next talking point - Children being separated from their "parents" at the border.  It's all of a sudden a crisis even though it was happening under Obama for years.  We are constantly being distracted.  Especially from the IG report which will be coming out soon...unedited, comrade.

Again, please point me to the quote where he literally said this.  The article *literally* makes a claim out of thin air.  I suggest you follow Tim Pool.  He is a Trump hating liberal that points out how the media uses headlines and misdirection to lie to the public making you believe things that are just not true.
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:29:55
Honest question: How?  Is there some type of wallet you use to make everyday purchases that converts it right there on the spot?  I too want to abandon USD, but it's not like I can pull up to a gas station and use BTC right now.  Or can I?

I'm probably going to get some hate for this, but I recently told my father that Bitcoin is Donald Trump's campaign in currency form.  "This is it folks, bitcoin is done."  "Is this the end of bitcoin?"  "10 reasons why bitcoin won't make it."  "Who really believes bitcoin will survive?"  "Bitcoin is not real currency."  "Bitcoin 'investors' don't know investing."  My friends get so excited to tell me bitcoin is crashing then get annoyed when it goes right back up.  Ect.

I'm very lucky that my friends were too dumb to figure out how to open a crypto account.  I'd much rather them laugh at me than to want to kill me.
@_date: 2018-07-02 05:18:30
Yeah, on Friday it jumped $5,800 to $6,400.
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:32:45
Excuse my ignorance here, but I was wondering - Let's say a large institution does decide to jump into crypto, how would they do so?  They wouldn't just one day pull the trigger and buy $10M worth of BTC all at once, would they?  Is that even possible?
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:43:56

My previous employer notified me that I had some money in an investment account that I need to rollover.  It's not much and considering I forgot about it in the first place I feel like this would be some "willing to lose" money.  Is there somewhere that I can rollover these funds to have it invested in BTC?  It would have to be a retirement account in order to avoid taxes.  Does that even exist at this point?  Any info would be appreciated.  Thank you!

Feels pretty good when people ask, "How much bitcoin do you have?"
To answer, "Not how much, how many."

I don't know about everyone else, but when BTC is on a bull run I thank the fuck out of it.

I have my wallet and the seed phrase in a safe where I live.  I also have a copy of the seed phrase on a piece of paper, laminated, in an envelope marked "DO NOT THROW AWAY" and stored in a relative's home safe.  It's not 100% secure.  My relative can hate me one day and steal it or somehow a thief get access to it and is aware that 24 words is a seed phrase.  If I had a good amount of crypto I'd probably look into more secure ways, but this should do for now.

I figured it would hover around $9k for a while so I sold some at $9,100.  For the first time ever, I was cheering for BTC to drop lol.  Didn't make all that much, but was a fun morning nonetheless.

Strong signals pointing at a btc breakout but as we've seen in the past anything can happen so we might see a big dropoff soon.
