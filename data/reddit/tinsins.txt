Even better than the dollar was wasting all their time. :D

Send me that million and I'll give you a 60% return (minus the original investment). :/

Welcome to Reddit. Use the search feature. This gets asked pretty frequently.
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:39:44
Nope, you've been caught.

$52 million seems like a lot of shorts liquidating over a mere $300 jump.

Add in another .00555555 I lost 5-6 years ago.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:11:41
Next watch them try to create B-Currency or something silly like that.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:01:01
There's no real way to time it. These are the only 2 coins I own as well, but  I'd recommend keeping a higher ratio in BTC as it will always (at least in the foreseeable future) be the dominant coin. Bite the bullet on fees and convert some over.

Or just let a grifter stab you in the liver. It's all good.

Dang, not a bad week.

That doesn't make any sense.

I'm up twelve bucks!

How in the world is the monthly min. wage equal to $3.50 when cost of living is 100 times higher than that?

I remember mcxnow exchange!!! I also lost a bunch of coins, but this was years ago before Bitcoin blew up.

No, if I recall correctly, at the time BTC was roughly around $450.

Somebody recommended Wasabi wallet to me. I don't know much about them. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:04:59
I don't follow anything outside BTC...what happened with ETH and the SEC?
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:33:00
Lol, I like you.
@_date: 2018-11-22 10:54:12
One of the best, well thought out responses I've seen on here. Thank you for the time you spent. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:51:04
Could be Coinbase.

Your 8 Bitcoins may be worth $8,500 very soon.
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:04:26
okey dokey
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:03:33
Congrats on all your new accounts!
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:37:59
lol, nailed it!
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:53:54
About $3.50
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:37:55
I prefer just to use Satoshis and Bitcoins.

You've been creating a lot of new accounts lately.

If you would read the article you'd see it is about Tether, not Bitcoin. 
Don't like facts? :D

Elon Musk giving Andrew Yang a little donation.

I'd also be interested in hearing the answer.

You have to show ID to open a bank account.

Just altcoins people like to play with, similar to Dogecoin (that was fun while it lasted). There isn't anything special about them. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:19:28
Hey guy! Have a wonderful upcoming 2019!

How is this determined?
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:09:24
Had the same thing happen to me in Aruba.
@_date: 2018-12-31 13:01:43
Hmm...maybe so. I'm in the U.S., I thought it peaked around 19k over here. Don't really remember exactly though, I didn't get back into BTC until a couple months ago.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:03:26
That is odd. Maybe it was a new customer service representative. I had a similar issue, but it took less than 30 seconds for me to access my account after I uploaded my ID on there.
