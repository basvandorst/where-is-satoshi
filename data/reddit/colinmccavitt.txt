Replace the country name with your country.  Same concept.

If the US government makes bitcoin contraband then  using and owning would be illegal and a large number of people would panic and try and sell out.  Wall Street people and Government people are connected and very intertwined.

More like financial suicide for the owners / consumers / operators of the banned item.

I assume you’ve converted all your assets to BTC by bow then. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:54:52
Government doesn’t care that criminals use dollars. It cares that it owns a LOT of dollars and BTC threatens those dollars. So in classic form they usually “ban” what they can’t keep up against (look up where encryption laws live). So I’m order to ban BTC they would need a “reason” and just having a single intercepted message from the lowest level ISIS waterboy saying “let’s look into BTC” is enough for a former used Cadillac salesman (now Congressman) to stand up and demand a ban (which they will all support because they also got caught flat footed and own $)

Very true. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:14:41
They won’t need to, they just made them virtually worthless
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:54:18
Why would “something happen”. Don’t you believe in BTC so much and it’s sound engineering that nothing could happen?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:02:28
That would the be the “pump” part before the “dump” part.  BTC value is being manipulated and eventually everyone seeking to make a buck will dump and there’s no central authority to call and complain to.

“Can be”
Until you do it, you haven’t done it.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:03:34
One big theft. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:47:41
And bitcoin will change that?

Maybe but remember the Secret Service in America has the job to protect America’s two most important assets.  
1.  Money 
2. The President. 
And BTC is being portrayed as threat to 
Food for thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:23:01
I’m talking in terms of the US (for example). Hypothetically US law makers determine Bitcoin to be illegal.  Therefore its use in the world would still go on (and even in the US) but the US use (and value) would decrease significantly because it is now illicit.

But then if the government has a problem with you then they tell the bank to not let you in. Then we’re back in the same problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:11:07
All true but if people mess with the fake US money we own your Uncle Sam  sends in Secret Service Agents to kick your door in. Theft of bitcoin or  fraud ... nobody shows up.  Uncle Sam has SEALS and helicopters to protect his concept, Satoshi has nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:42:00
Where do you use it ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:44:35
By “paying for things” do you  mean when you trade your bitcoin for an object that isn’t $?. If so, those are services or items  but not $.
Being Bitcoin rich isn’t being $ rich until you convert it to $.

My point is that he seems like an unstable person that cant control himself. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:33:42
They both have intrinsic value. But having BTC doesn’t mean anything about having $. It’s what you could have if you converted it. If you don’t convert your BTC you don’t have $. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:57:01
Pretty wild right ?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:55:45
Ok then too should feel comfortable putting ALL of your assets into BTC then. r/WCGW
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:06:45
It’s all in the code. We can all read it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:04:56
Isn’t cash harder to move? I think that’s one of bitcoins major selling points.

You mean MTGOX 2.0 ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:58
Excellent list.  Very helpful. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:25:43
Meaning you don’t TOTALLY believe that it will be implemented as an every day currency.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:58
It’s a joke 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:52:44
It’s worth watching.

Also true. I have just saved myself a $130,000 loss !!
