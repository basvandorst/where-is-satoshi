A bit of a long post here but please give it a read if you have the time:
Five years ago, someone very dear to me was forced to fight a gruesome war he did not choose, and gave his life along the way. This person meant the world to me; he was my blood, my family, and most importantly, he was my friend. This person was my amazing grandfather, who lost a war against cancer. Four years later, while the wounds from my grandfather’s death were still fresh, cancer visited my family again, this time taking my aunt with it.
We all know someone in our lives who’s been affected by cancer in one way or another. Whether it’s a loved one or a stranger, our global community changes ever so slightly whenever cancer attacks one of our loved ones. But deep down I know that we cannot be silent observers of this war – there is much that needs to be done on our side to win this war that has been going on for way too long. However, as individuals, we lack the appropriate resources to do so.
And this is why I, along with a group of 30 amazing human beings, will be running 4000 miles across the United States in the summer of 2018 to raise funds for cancer research. We will be running from San Francisco on the West Coast all the way to Baltimore on the East. Our pilgrimage is called the “4K For Cancer”, and each runner will have to raise a minimum of $5000 by April 2018. For now, my target is to raise $1000 by the end of 2017, and it would mean the world to me if you guys would support my cause by donating.
If you would like to be a part of this small but brave cause, the link to the fundraising page is down below. Donations can be made via debit or credit cards, and there is no fixed amount to donate – remember, every cent counts! Also, if you want to donate via Bitcoin, reach out to me and we can make something work!☺️

Once again, thank you so much!

To be honest, I prefer a slower increase, as a meteoric rise usually result in a violent correction ��
