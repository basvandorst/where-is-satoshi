Could I suggest an EDUCATION REQUIREMENT instead of (or possibly with) a TIME delay requirement?  
IMO the best way to make them hodl the way YOU would is to expose them to the same information that made YOU want to hodl.  Pick 1 or 2 of your favorite videos on the subject and make them REQUIRED to watch before they get their inheritance.  Something to the effect of, "I am leaving you X-dollars in TODAY money, it is YOURS to do with as you see fit... But first I want you to listen to this so you actually know what I'm giving you and why I THINK you shouldn't actually spend it TODAY."  You could also make a bigger collection of suggested readings/videos/forums that aren't 'required' but that you recommend if they take your point to heart and want to learn more.  But then let them decide from there.  
Yes, It opens the possibility they might spend it sooner. but that could be a good thing. What if the market changes in ways you didn't expect? What if mom breaks her hip? Or your sister is about to lose her house and they really need that money now, but it is locked for 3 more years?  Just food for thought.

DAMN IT! 
        I JUST told MY mom about your post because it is cute and I thought she’d get a kick out of it because it just so happened that like 5 days ago she and a girlfriend asked me about BTC for the first time EVER. They said ‘we didn’t know if bitcoin was still around, until today we saw a sign saying they accept it now. What is it?’  So I gave the very short version of ‘yup it’s still around, still uncertain but pretty strong, and very cool with big potential’ etc.  but I liked that they asked!
        PROBLEM IS, Hand-to-God, when I read this just now her exact words were “Yeah, EBT, that’s the sign I saw... that’s Bitcoin right?” 
YOU SIR have simultaneously made me laugh and yet stolen away a moment of proudness in my mother thank/curse you!!!  :-)

It’s for the same reason that when you leave the bar, you wouldn’t shout, “I’VE GOT $5000 CASH IN MY POCKET RIGHT NOW!” 
If you did, would it mean you would DEFINITELY get mugged? Of corse not. But bottom line is you just INCREASED the chances of it happening... Why would you do that to yourself? And why wouldn’t you warn others not to do it too?

Invest where you want and avoid whatever you decide, but NEVER LET “LATE TO THE GAME” BOTHER YOU. People probably felt late to the game when Amazon stock went from like $7 to $300 and they didn’t understand how ‘that internet site I’ve vaguely heard of (that I think sells books)’ was so valuable. So they weren’t on the-ground-floor, oh well, can’t time travel... but doesn’t mean for a second that they shouldn’t have learned about it then and still bought it then. It’s now a household name, industry powerhouse and worth around 7x their money now. 
Don’t worry about ‘I wish I had learned or bought in the past’.  Just learn everything you can today and place your bets on the future! For me (and many others here), I think there is still a lot of growth in Bitcoin’s future. (Btw, according to Cointelegraph, only 11% of Americans own BTC, so you’re probably not as late as you think anyways). Don’t waste time on what you did or didn’t do in the past, pivot that same mental energy into learning and deciding what you’ll do next instead. Asking good questions is a good start. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:32:22
I think this is exactly right. 
The only thing I would add is that if MY little brother actually WANTED to invest (in anything) at a young age... I’d point-blank tell him something like “I’m proud of you for being responsible and thinking about investing already. So I want to give you a bonus gift.”  Then I’d take him to lunch or give him a $20 gift card to the movies or a store he likes. Just to reward the sentiment with a LITTLE instant gratification for the young lad ;-)

Well, they CERTAINLY DO worry about those things too and/or take the necessary steps to increase their protection.
       They probably paid extra to have that nice house in a low crime area. Even then, many of the nicer houses paid even more to be in gated (or even patrolled) communities. On top of that, the cars and house also each have locks and alarm systems.  Some security cameras around the house are pretty common too.  EVEN THEN, home and auto insurance are both multi-hundred-Billion dollar industries, because even with all that precaution, your buddy with the Porsche and the hot wife STILL MIGHT get robbed.
But as to your question about what is different about bitcoin? Many things, but here are 3 for starters:
1) All the items above are insured, bitcoin isn’t.
2) it’s more attractive to a thief because it’s easier to move, hide, resell, etc. than the car, the house, or the jewelry.
3) hackers can be anyone from anywhere in the world that has internet. So the number of potential thieves is much larger than the number of thieves that could physically get to that Porsche.

@_date: 2019-11-22 09:03:22
Not being snarky, serious question. 
     How is this better than just having it direct deposit to your existing bank account like normal and then converting whatever % or dollar amount you want in your favorite exchange? Even if automation were your goal, coinbase and a few others can setup recurring transfers/purchases for you. I’m not seeing the advantage, so why pay their fee?
@_date: 2019-11-14 05:57:47
      I did a similar thing when I deployed to Iraq.  That was only 1 year and bitcoin didn’t exist then, but same idea. I definitely lost money on my gamble, but was willing to take the chance at that age and didn’t/don’t regret it. Wish it had worked differently but still feel like it was worth the shot.  
      One thing I’d recommend is to still keep a traditional bank account with at least $1-2k cash in it when you leave, just for convenience. Inevitably, there will be some bill or something you forgot to handle. Or something you can’t get in Africa and turns out you really really miss it and want a care-package shipped (for me it was under amour shirts and my favorite sour candy haha). But asking dad to pay the parking ticket you forgot about, or your buddy to pack up some stuff you’d like is a LOT easier if the request starts with “I just went online and transferred you $100, could you please...”  Then it’s a favor, not a financial challenge for them.  Can’t tell you your gamble will go any better than mine did, but I wish you luck!

What am I missing? How is this better than longitude and latitude?
@_date: 2019-11-26 07:09:39
I can see that. 
I’m WAY newer to this than you, but already I have seen a lot of the same questions asked and roll my eyes a bit at some of the more extreme posts and comments. 
I think it’d be nice if there were a few more tiers of bitcoin subreddits. Because asking questions (even dumb ones) is important to learning. I even think SOME exposure to overly-bearish and overly-bullish attitudes is probably good to help someone figure out where they themselves stand. But this sub sometimes has the feeling of taking college students, high schoolers, and first graders all in the same class. And I don’t mean in an elitist or intelligence level sense, just an experience and total exposure level. But an appropriate question (or even great question) for a 2nd grader to ask, is still going to be old news (at best) to the college junior or (at worst) seem outright annoying and juvenile. That’s why there are grades and students are devided by age and what they’ve already learned. 
... And I know the ‘for beginners’ sub exists. But a) if your like me, you found this sub first because you just searched “bitcoin” and didn’t know any better yet and b) I get the sense many people leave that sub sooner than they maybe should because, in fairness, “who wants to ask another beginner”.  But I think there should be something like “seasoned bitcoiners” subreddit that is invite only (keep in mind I personally still wouldn’t qualify, but would look forward to it). That only accepts people who posted/commented in this or the beginner sub at LEAST 1 year earlier.  It wouldn’t root out ALL  troubles, but it would certainly reduce the posts based on total nonsense and the people who are talkative AF for a few weeks, then ghosts. Just as there can still be somebody in a college class that probably shouldn’t be. There would still be very different levels of knowledge too, but for the most part, it would ensure a little more like-minded and similar commitment level. 
Plus guys like you, that are OGs could still “slum it” here with noobs like me whenever you were in the mood for dropping some knowledge! ��

If you didn’t already, CALL YOUR BANK BACK and tell them to block all future transactions to coinbase.  Otherwise the thief might not stop at the bitcoin you already had sitting in the exchange.  With access to your coinbase they could use whatever bank account or card you linked to coinbase to pull more money out of your bank, buy new coin, and send that new coin to themselves too.

That is an awesome and generous (even split 15ways) gift! Congrats!
     18 is where most people/governments consider you an adult and a significant stake invested in a significant tech/commodity is a cool and fun gift to signify that adulthood too. Best thing you can do, IMHO, is use the gift in the most adult fashion you can. To me, that means learn everything you can so you use it as wisely as possible.  It is awesome that your uncle is teaching you. A trusted person that knows more than you and wants to help  can definitely shorten any learning curve. But don’t settle for that! Read all that you can (and watch videos too) that have different opinions and takes on bitcoin. Compare ideas, good and bad, for yourself and make it your goal that in 6 months time, or even less, YOU be teaching Your Uncle things too. As somebody above warned, there are scammers and if it sounds too good to be true it probably is, but there’s a lot of real potential too.
My suggestion would be MOVE SLOW, BUT READ FAST! :-) Welcome aboard and good luck!

It does take some tech knowledge, but not necessarily by the person investing or running the investments. There are MANY entrepreneurs that sell SAS subscriptions or make money through their apps... but they didn’t write the code, they hired programmers or developers. I would image many miners have done that too.
@_date: 2019-10-29 10:21:13
They wouldn’t have any responsibility as in it’s’their fault’. They were NOT RESPONSIBLE for it happening AT ALL..... 
.....but there’s still a certain element of ‘responsible behavior’ that you would expect (or at least hope for) from any person or company, that ignoring help requests and deleting posts aren’t really in the spirit of.  Like if I found your wallet on the street... I certainly wasn’t responsible for your pocket tearing or you lazily or clumsily dropping it. But still the “responsible” (and in many places, legally required) thing for me to do would be to make all reasonable efforts to find you and return it.  I might look at the ID and see if you were still around, or turn it into the police or a lost and found.  His scenario though is more like if you were standing 5ft from me and shouting “has anybody seen my wallet?”  For me to stay quiet and keep it wouldn’t be very responsible, just shitty.  And if they continue to delete his posts asking about it, we’ll that’s worse than just blanking you. That would be like if I had security escort you out for shouting ‘has anyone seen my wallet?’
@_date: 2019-10-24 08:36:00
They still wouldn’t change the limit? That Limit is one of the fundamental points of bitcoin’s creation.
As for needing more of it to go around that will not be an issue any time soon. Bitcoin already goes out to 8 decimal places, which means even at $10,000 per bitcoin you could currently work in increments of $.0001  or 1/100th of a penny. 
Even if BTC goes back up to 10k and then 1000Xs from there, you would still be working in 10 cent increments.
BUT TO PLAY THE WHAT IF GAME: 
Even if it got up to 1BTC= $100Billion then the smallest unit to work with (.00000001btc) would be $1,000. Too much to be practical for some transactions or affordable to some people (which I think is what you are worried about). Then there WOULD have to be a change made to keep it practical. But that change still wouldn’t be to increase the supply of BTC in existence. it would probably be to simply change the system to go out to more decimal places (12, 15, 32, 171 decimal places... whatever, it could go as small as it ever needed to) and just work in smaller pieces at a time.  Terminology might chance, like you said microSats, but the name doesn’t matter. Also it is entirely possible that new tools like lightning network or similar will take over the smaller stuff and even at that massive level, the 8 decimal places might remain sufficient.  
But either way, they wouldn’t increase the supply of bitcoins because 1)there wouldn’t be a need and 2) it would just hurt the value
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:15:13
      Over simplified, it means you don’t own and hold your bitcoin, THEY do. Then they show your ‘account balance’ which is more like a credit with them than real bitcoin. It can be simpler to work with but is NO WHERE NEAR as secure. It’s more like Disney-dollars or arcade tokens that ONLY work at coin base. They ‘promise’ to give you that much ‘credit’ in theory, but if they get hacked, or go out of business, or just decide to screw you... you have nothing. It’s better to control your own bitcoins, THAT is what real wallets do.
2 suggestions:
1) google something like “why you shouldn’t leave bitcoins in an exchange” and read 2, 5, 10 articles... whatever it takes you to really understand... IT’S IMPORTANT 
2.) I suspect your real question is “what exchanges will let me buy with PayPal?”. If so, ask that. BUT only after you understand step 1 because whatever exchange you use to buy your coins is fine but don’t let them stay in that exchange.  It’s like buy your groceries at whichever store suits you best, but for God’s sake don’t leave them at the grocery store once you bought them!

      If you feel you didn’t do the 2018 filing correctly (or fully), then you should probably revisit it. Both for “do it right” sake and for your own piece of mind.  Since you have to revisit 1 year anyways, why not find a DIFFERENT qualified tax consultant and have him/her amend that year and also audit/review 2017 as well.  My guess is that adding a ‘does this seem right?’ Level review of 2017 filings shouldn’t add too much to the 2018 bill, especially If they say ‘it looks great’.  Then the small added cost should be well worth the piece of mind from a 2nd (professional) opinion on something that is clearly bothering you.  If they say ‘wow this is way off’ then your bill with the new tax firm will probably go up because they’ll want to do a deeper dive,..but again, probably for a reason that is worth getting right... especially if you think you overpaid. could actually come out ahead.

If the Trezor was never compromised, just the seed... Then why not use the Trezor to create a NEW seed and wallet and transfer your BTC there? Your issue sounds similar to this thread (and probably others). They seem to suggest the same idea.

Seriously though, my best advice is:
 Step 1: (As mentioned above) buy a Tiny bit TODAY to have some skin in the game and enhance your interest/motivation. Exchanges all have their own advantages/disadvantages but IMHO (unless you HATE the idea of KYC), Coinbase has the best ratio of easy to use/ good enough for your first few purchases. After that, as you learn more, decide if another works better for your personal needs.
Step 2: make a plan to INVEST REGULARLY (dollar cost averaging). Could be "I have an extra $50 a month" or "I'll cut back big on x,y,z and invest $1000/wk" whatever amount, the point is do it REGULARLY.
Step 3: READ READ READ ridiculous amounts about it, watch videos, ask questions etc and learn all you can.
Step 4: make your own steps now that you know something!
Good luck!

If you’re going to ‘break something down’ in a cocky condescending tone, at least try to be right. 
All you’ve done is prove the “mindless job” might be all your character will ever qualify for because all that scenario did was waste time and effort, complicate his taxes, and INCREASE THE FEES (somewhere between 2.5% to 5.5%) which means he’ll be living in that basement longer than he needed to.
1) ACHs are FREE, not $15   See: 
2) You don’t have GO to a bank for an ACH either (The A is for automated). He can do it from the basement or Walmart
3) Using the debit card is a 4% fee 
4) ACH absolutely can deposit USD, doesn’t need to be USDC. Then you can buy immediately at or wait and dip-hunt a day or two later at 1.5%
5) BONUS: If you end up waiting the 5 business days before the dip you were looking for and the deposit has already cleared; then you can transfer (Free and instantly) to CBpro instead and buy the dip for only 0.50% and save another full percent.
6) taxes are simplified and or delayed because there is no added (unnecessary) buying and selling of a stable coin, that served you no purpose
7) You also added a transaction fee and/or up to 2% “spread margin” for coinbase to “covert” the USDC into BTC for you.
Stable coins have some potential uses, but I don’t think DCA is one of them and I’m quite certain that your scenario is not one. And feel free to makeup hypotheticals if they help you ask a question... but don’t make up fees that don’t exist while ignoring real ones that actually do. Somebody looking for help might invest based on what is said in these threads, so let’s try to use facts not stories with bad numbers.

@_date: 2019-10-24 10:20:25
For sure. I think about the potential pitfalls all the time and, as I said, I’d rather have the good and the bad both be widely and rationally discussed. Partly because if a problem is real, no one should ignore it. But also (maybe mostly) because when more minds discuss a possible pitfall, they often either realize it isn’t actually a problem or they confirm that it is a problem but find a way to avoid it. I’m all for discussion over cheerleading (or at times even willful ignorance). I’m still with you on the broad concept, just felt like your wording may have fought over-blown with over-blown ;-)
Edit: But this IS the internet... maybe that’s the only way to go
@_date: 2019-10-15 02:05:54
That isn’t what I’m talking about. You can still DCA without using any stable coin. You can do regular or occasional deposits and either buy right then or wait for dip, whatever best works for you... But if you are going to wait and try to buy a dip, then just leave your deposits in USD form in your account until you buy the bitcoin if you want only 1 taxable event. Otherwise you are creating an extra (and sooner) taxable event because when you buy the BTC, you are technically selling a stable coin, then buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:58:19
I mean this as a serious question, although it’s going to sound weird....
If you are a cattle rancher and one (or 10) of your cows have a calf, is that a taxable event?  You suddenly have a new asset that you didn’t have before in that scenario too?
Seems like the sensible thing to do would just be wait till a calf or forked coin is sold.

These all seem like posters best guesses into where to invest (which might have been what you meant to ask, if so feel free to ignore the rest of this post)... But what you actually asked was best chance to have no regrets
IMHO, the best way to avoid regrets is to KNOW when you look back (even if things went wrong) that you did the very best you could do with the tools available to you. I would suggest step 1 being to sit down, crunch some numbers, look at rent, movie purchases, food, coffee, beer, car, travel etc. and first know where your money currently goes. Then figure out what you could/should tighten up on. If something is important to you (say travel) keep that or expand it even, but trim the other areas and MAKE YOURSELF A BUDGET AND STICK TO IT. 
After that this question becomes, I have X amount to invest and then do your homework read a ton rather than just asking Redditors’ opinions and decide what percentages of X you want in cash, BTC, gold, stocks, bonds, whatever you decide is the right risk vs potential for you and your goals.  
Not the sexiest answer, or the easiest, but I think best way to not regret. Good luck

The PROBLEM with this answer is that it's defense is built strongly on 'drugs are the SECOND biggest commodity, BEHIND FOOD.'
      Any decent debater that is trying to bash bitcoin would GLADLY let you make this comment. Then they'd immediately pivot away from drugs and ask well how easily could we buy the MOST traded commodity in history then with "your money"?... And that answer isn't great for bit coiners YET. When their follow up is, "if my kids are hungry can I take bitcoin to the supermarket and feed my children?"... About the best you can say is 'hopefully some day' or 'you can at a few stores and that number will go up later'. Neither of which is a great answer. Any answer that involves exchanging it first is even worse because what the lay person HEARS is, 'it can't be real money because I have to turn it in for REAL money before I can spend it to feed my kids'. This answer isn't at all wrong, but you trap yourself with this answer.
IMHO, we are better off dismissing the drug comments as what they are, over-reactionary emotional arguments. Something like, 
"all that shows is that bitcoin is valuable... And, unfortunately, people in the drug trade will give or accept anything of value for their drugs. The US dollar is still by far the most common value exchanged for drugs, but you aren't villainizing it because you know you don't throw out all it's legitimate or helpful uses just because a few criminals find ways to MISuse it. Btw, a junky will also steal your wallet, your car, or your TV because they have value too... Should we outlaw or over-regulate wallets, cars or TVs, of course not. But if you are unlucky enough that a desperate kinky does steal your car or wallet, at least you'll know your bitcoins are safe."
      Now instead of arguing their silly stance and trapping yourself, you've instead shown it as the nonsense it is and already pointed the next topic of conversation/debate toward security, where you'll win. Just my 2 cents, hope it's at least food for thought to a few people. Thanks

      Before you get a lawyer I would recommend trying EXHAUSTIVELY  to get coinbase’s attention and a REAL response from a person there, not just canned answer.  I know you have started this process and it probably already feels like you’ve done more than you Should need to, but exhaust it. Try every email address, phone number, chat helps, forums (inside and outside of reddit), Twitter, Instagram, Facebook accounts etc etc etc. literally every angle you can find and try them all 1-3 times a day for the next 4 days.  
BEST CASE SCENARIO: 
     it will feel like forever, but eventually you will get the attention of somebody that wants to make right a mistake. Might save yourself some legal fees and headache by simply remembering that most customer service is as automated as a company can possibly make it and knowing that you may have to be a very squeaky wheel (especially as a non-client) to actually get the right human eye-balls to look at it.
     Btw, as mentioned above, if they want to charge a fee for their time to correct what was ultimately your mistake... I’d strongly suggest considering that a small price to pay and marking it in the ‘Win’ column and moving on.
WORST CASE SCENARIO: 
      You will spend a few hours of googling the first day to find all possible avenues of contact... Plus another 20minutes each on day 2-4 to copy/paste/repost to each... and you will STILL get no real response. If that’s the case, then those few hours were probably still worth trying for any chance to save nearly $20k.  If nothing else, they will also give you a more substantial paper trail to show a lawyer. That might help make a lawyer more interested in pursuing it and/or give them more ammo to work with if they do pursue it.

Actually I don’t have ANY problem with thinking of a random number as safe or at least a powerfully tool towards safe... what I have a problem with is thinking of ANY “generated” number as actually random (if that makes sense). If a program or algorithm made it then there are rules to it, which is the antithesis of random.  That’s why not understanding quite where seeds come from and how their used has been nagging at me.  I feel like I should have at least SOME understanding of those rules to get a sense of the for-all-intents-and-purposes randomness. You guys are helping me a lot with that sense thanks all :-)

I guess I should have known that. It just feels like the flip side of the exponential-numbers-get-so-big coin, is that even basic computers do such unfathomable numbers of actions per second that it’s hard to wrap my head around what servers or whole arrays can crank out. Gut feeling is those two immense numbers should sort of even each other out... but of course that isn’t right, they are whole different leagues of big aren’t they.  Thanks

Haha weird post bro
I thought I was gunna be with you for the first few sentences, because even though I think BTC is brilliant and will grow, I also think overly-fan-boy rants or insanely overblown predictions don’t help anyone. I thought that you were going to make an appeal for measured optimism or rational discussion that allows the good and the bad to be heard...... THEN YOU WENT BONKERS haha... you went off the rails man and just started spitting hate instead. Been drinking tonight? haha

Right... like I said... ‘different leagues of big’ haha. Actually that does help put it in perspective. Thanks

That looks like a great link! I already read the first 4-5 sections and scanned a few more further down and I can already tell it is better presented and clearer than any of the articles or blogs I’ve read about seeds. I’ll read the whole thing in the morning, thank you.

But the risk is it backfiring.   
Your Apple example is different because people have a rough sense that apple is valuable and they understand a stock split. What they don’t understand, to your point, is that bitcoin is so divisible. 
So if we start talking in smaller units then they still won’t have learned it’s divisible ... they will just think the price of bitcoin has tanked
IMHO better to teach whomever you can how already divisible and investors-of-any-size friendly it ALREADY is, rather than trying to change the lingo mid-stride. Then each person can thing in whatever sized chunks work best for them. But when most people only know little pieces of a system to begin with, changes usually increase the misunderstandings

You also turn it into 2 separate purchases aka 2 separate taxable events, instead of one.  
And it makes one of those 2 events happen immediately every time you ‘sell/trade’ your usdc for BTC.  If you are already trading or even just have a good record keeping system that might not be a big deal... But for anyone who has ONLY been buying and hodling and planned they’d figure out the tax part ‘someday when they sell’... then you just made that “someday” come the very next time you purchase. Up to you if that is significant or not to you. But imo, when in doubt, the less complicated option usually works out better.

Got it, Thank you!
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:30:58
Thanks for the explanation. The part I’m still not grasping though is, How would those paper-40million effect the price of actual on-chain BTC? It seems like the paper-players are only betting against other paper-players. What am I missing? Thanks
Edit: typo

So, to stick with your enigma analogy (which SOUNDLY beats my decoder ring one btw), are the different BIP numbers analogous to different standards of build and/or settings of enigma machines? Ie Do any wallets using 39 all get the same output from a given input and could effectively recover each other... Likewise all 49 are on the same page as each other... but give a 39 seed to a 49 wallet and they produce gibberish?

Get a professional’s opinion is always the best advice. But I THINK what you are missing is that there are 2 separate taxes that can (and in your case probably both do) apply.
1) is Capital Gains tax. 
      This is probably the one you are thinking of where most people only have to worry about it when they sell BTC. It is charged based on how much you made/lost by buying at price X and selling at price Z.  Most people’s income is in $ and they pay their income tax on that and think of it as a separate thing... so in their minds, they only pay BTC tax when they sell.  But in YOUR situation income tax is interwoven because you are getting paid in BTC. SO 
2) is Income Tax. 
       You are paid in bitcoin, not dollars, but it’s still income. (Oversimplified, but) the IRS treats bitcoin as property. So, It is similar to if there were an electrician who built a whole lighting rig and audio/visual setup for the Kawasaki trade-show and instead of paying him a few grand cash, they gave him one of their dirt bikes for doing it.  He can take the bike as payment but he has to add the cash equivalent to that year’s income total when April comes around. Basically, your pay in bitcoin works similarly to him taking the bike as payment and you have to declare its equivalent as income. But, again, a tax professional can fill in more detail and save you a LOT of headache and worry.  My guess, it’d be well worth the price for you.

Hahaha I think most of our scammer senses started tingling... But I love that your brain was certain the old lady must be trapped in a sex scandal :-p

ALLLL that fancy school-learnin’ and only took TWO words into the post to make a spelling error/ tense-shift... tsk tsk tsk ;-)
Haha, but all teasing and nit-picking aside, good on ya for not just passively wanting a thing! Way to take action and forge a path to it bro
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:14:24
... Then you can skip bitcoin, because you've already made it, my friend. You are living the dream!

 “BUY FINE  ART CHEAPER WITH BITCOIN!!!”
The concept is great, but unfortunately in today’s world the actual practical result is that you will severely limit your pool of potential buyers. Any time you make it harder for the customer to pay, you lose some customers... 
SO STEAL A TECHNIQUE THAT GAS STATIONS USE! 
Feel free to have your Preferred method of payment. For the gas station (or some shops), that’s cash... For you, it’s bitcoin! But don’t make that the ONLY form of payment. Instead CALL it a “discount” for bitcoin. To be clear it isn’t really a BTC discount... it’s more like a fiat penalty (but calling it that would just be bad marketing haha). So you still set this price to the amount you actually want ie~$1500 for a BTC sale.  But then set a $ price too and go ahead and mark it up a good sized chunk, say ~$1800 or 2000 for example.  Then the customer can choose, or even start a conversation about BTC or simply write you a bigger check as a “convenience” (read ignorance) fee. Then you buy bitcoin with it :-)
BENEFITS TO YOU:
- You haven’t lost ANY potential customers
- You get to know you did some good PR for the community
- Might even get a higher price
BENEFITS TO THE CUSTOMER:
- Choice; They can learn something and save!... or just simply buy
BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY:
- Bitcoin gets top billing and good exposure (at minimum)
- Some people might even leave thinking ‘hmm, save money by using Bitcoin?... Maybe I should look into it.” (Even better)
- You might even be responsible for somebody buying and spending their first BTC just because they love your art ;-) 
... Just an idea. But I think it strikes a good balance. Good luck!

I’m all for more people buying and +1 if they do it on a regular basis... but, in your eyes, what does them all doing it on the same schedule add?
Asked another way, why are you taking a vote or trying to decide a specific time at all, rather than just pushing a strong case for the core of your idea that a) little bits add up for you as an investor, b) they add up even more for the community if 10,000,000 people do them SO c. Whenever your payday is setup an automatic investment. If you can make it bigger, great! But even if it’s only $10-20 per paycheck; start today and do it EVERY paycheck!!! Why make the timing a group activity?
