Yes, you can merge-mine several coins

[A Bitcoin address is a 160-bit hash of the public portion of a public/private ECDSA keypair.](
You take the public key, SHA256 hash it, RIPEMD160 hash that, slap a byte of zeros on the front, SHA256 hash that, SHA256 hash it again, take the first four bytes of that and put it on the end of the earlier RIPEMD160 hash with the zero byte on the front, then encode that into a base58 string (using bitcoin's encoding) to get the address.

"Notice: Do NOT mine directly directly to your Cryptsy deposit address."

How more uncompressed can you get than the original 256 bits?
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:53:12
I don't know why not, but for example cryptsy says not to mine to your addresses there.

I wonder if the news that cex.io hashing will be able to be directed elsewhere will increase the value of those ghs.
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:05:34
You cannot mine to exchange addresses.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:06:02
To be fair, if you buy ghs on CEX.io, someone else just sold them on CEX.io, so there is no increase or decrease in hashrate on ghash.io due to the transaction.
CEX.io is not too expensive if you sell back without much loss.  Right now if 1GHs produces 0.0003 BTC per day that is how much the price can drop before you won't come out ahead.  Its a market, though, so hard to predict.

I'm surprised no one has posted this p2pool merged mining guide:
It shows you how to set up merged mining with p2pool for bitcoin, namecoin, devcoin, ixcoin, and i0coin, and in the same manner you can add in groupcoin and bytecoin and anything else that can be merge-mined.  It shows you how to set up p2pool for litecoin as well (not merge-mined).  P2Pool does require you to have the daemons running for everything you are mining if you are running your own node, so you'll need space to store all those blockchains.  When merge-mining, the daemons for the coins handle your non-bitcoin payouts, i.e. you don't specify an address for them in your p2pool settings.

Merged mining is certainly possible! You need to have daemons running for all the coins you want to merge mine, though.

Thanks for the direction.  As for openssl, I've found how to generate an appropriate private key resulting in a pem file, and how to display that private key and the corresponding public key in hex (from which I can generate addresses).  How can I take a private key in hex that I have created elsewhere and turn it into a pem file that openssl can work with to calculate the public key?

Are you planning to release an update to allow compatibility with iOS 7.0.4 devices?
@_date: 2014-01-06 13:00:10
You could probably run a p2pool node on a raspberry pi, but you need enough storage space for the block chain (12GB or so just for bitcoin).  If you simply want to connect to a p2pool node and not run one, then its like using any other pool.

Add support for merge mining namecoin, devcoin, groupcoin, ixcoin, i0coin, bytecoin, etc.

It is possible to design a cryptographic scheme to prove some aspect of the data or even manipulate the data without revealing the data itself, however the wallet.dat encryption was probably not designed with those features in mind.
@_date: 2014-01-06 16:58:37
It has always been that way.  I suspect it has something to do with their software not reliably being able to verify transactions from mining.

What did you expect?
