Thanks for the explanation. What happens if two transactions' priority turns out equal?

This is what I saw some of my friends did:
Immediately after the Iraq war is *ended*, they started to buy Iraqi-currency in large amounts. Their bet is that after the war is ended, Iraq economy will stabilize and value of its currency increases. So, you get more in returns for your investment.
We can look at this as a master-plan: Find a weaker country with large enough population and destroy it in a war. Its economy and value of its currency will drop. After the war is ended, the people who survived will definitely rebuild the country. (Everybody wants a stable environment for their children, right?) So, its economy will come back to life. So, any investment made immediately after the war will grow huge.
Of course, this is only possible with fiat currencies.
+1 Bitcoin!!!

AFAICS the necessary condition is a total partial order that doesn't depend on the arrival time.
Arrival time cannot be included because of network delays. -- txs can arrive in different order to different nodes.

If you think about this, bitcoin, while truly is revolutionary, it won't be as big as internet.
It sometimes annoys me when people here say bitcoin is like internet in 1980s.

Hahaha. I just meant, unrestricted information-flow is a bigger contribution to humanity than unrestricted monetary-flow.

Your statement is correct, but only after bitcoin. Money couldn't be transmitted like information before bitcoin is invented.
Now, with bitcoin, we can have,

similar to

Yes, you put it in words better than me.

Exactly. Attacker pool cannot make money by disrupting the blockchain, because that will cause a crash and attacker pool has more to loose!

How about the bitcoin printed/encoded on the paper with what it is worth just like regular currency?
I am a bitcoin newbie, so I am not sure if this is even possible.

Not to dispute or anything...
Credit card transactions are tied to a Person (Bank Account or Identity), so a fear of legal issues would prevent most of the people not to mess with the system.  But bitcoin transactions are not tied to any identity and they are anonymous. So, merchants should wait for at least ONE confirmation, otherwise double-spending can go undetected, isn't it?
This is one issue I couldn't get convinced about bitcoin system.
Are there any statistics on how much time a transaction takes to reach to all P2P nodes of the network? If we have an upper bound of, say 10 seconds, then after 10 seconds we can at least detect the double-spend attempts? So, this will give lot more confidence to the merchants.

I think, it only means road ahead is hard. It would take more time but since there is inherent value to the bitcoin, it will win in the end.

Actually, the more I think about what would happen when 21M limit is reached, the more scared I feel.
I suspect, new channels around that time will be with full of news on how bitcoin would fall because there will be no more coins to be created.
People will panic and start exchanging their bitcoin into dollars. Bitcoin exchange rate would fall sharply. Some people may hold on to them though and some will probably buy more.
Value of the bitcoin would be proportional to the value of goods people want to sell *only* through bitcoins -- because of anonymity, etc.
This means, markets like silk road (and with luck any, exports of countries/govs that commit to bitcoin as the only international exchange currency) decide the value of the bitcoin. Trade volume, I guess, would be a lot smaller than the rest of the trade volume in fiat currency.
This is just a guess work; I don't want to believe this :-(

I think coinbase is a wrong choice.  They can get hacked or rogue employee may steal. We don't know how secure their backend is.
I would suggest to (1) stick to QT application (2) Enable encrypted wallets (3) take backup of encrypted wallet.dat to USB sticks or email it to multiple addresses (gmail+yahoo), etc.

Thank you, I wasn't aware that mining reward decreases overtime. That is very interesting.
Why do you think bitcoin transactions would be cheap? because huge number of transactions would be added per block?
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:55:46
Hey, I just read the bitcoin.pdf paper again and I couldn't find any references to the block-reward decreasing overtime. Could you point me to where this was proposed?
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:00:11
Wow. This minor detail seems to be very important point.
Ignoring the blockchain, is this what prevents double spent transactions from propagating up the network?
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:52:13
Here are my thoughts, but I am never sure though.
I believe, we will have fiat currency along with bitcoin in the future. This means, there will always be a volatile exchange rate.
When we hit the 21M bitcoin limit, my guess is that exchange rate would become (almost) stable.
When we reach to this point, there is no incentive for people to keep holding on to the bitcoins -- because it won't go up anymore.
So, people would start exchanging the bitcoins for the goods they want to buy. So, bitcoins would be released into the market (i hope) slowly at a pace that doesn't change the exchange rate drastically.
After some time, bitcoin becomes the just like any other currency.

Thank you again. I learned one more new thing about bitcoin.
I didn't know that each transaction includes the transaction-fee *offer* to the miner. I was thinking it was the other-way, where miner would *ask* for the transaction-fee.
Let me digest this, before I get back to you with more questions :)
