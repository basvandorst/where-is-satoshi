That's an American-specific (or rather, two-party) problem. You should change how your electoral system works (most European countries don't have that issue). Australia also has that problem but at least we have preferential voting so people can actually vote for who they really want to be in charge without having to worry about the spoiler effect.


I get that folks on believe that the gold standard was a good idea, but I'm really struggling to understand what you're saying -- every government and leader in the history of humanity has printed money. A (modern) economy cannot exist without money, and money cannot exist without someone printing it.

Civilised countries negotiate down the cost of prescription drugs (in a universal healthcare system, the government chooses which brands of medicine are prescribed by doctors and thus they have the ability to negotiate with companies to reduce their prices so that they can get more business), as well as subsidise them.
Nobody is holding laboratories at gun-point -- you don't have to pretend to be stupid to make your point. If you don't like taxes, good for you -- but I'd prefer my taxes be spent helping sick people than killing people overseas. Governments will always collect taxes, so I think it's more productive that the money be spent on something good.

I don't think you understand how healthcare negotiation works. It's not that expensive medical products become illegal or regulated-out-of-existence. What actually happens is that the government offers a limited number of opportunities for pharmaceutical companies to access the incredibly lucrative public healthcare market. But in order to get medicare-listed (which means that the cost to the public is subsidised and everyone who doesn't have private heatlhcare uses your product), the companies have to out-bid each other -- resulting in cheaper prices to the government. This is how literally every other government contract works.
The main benefit of such as system is that pharmaceutical companies cannot do what they do in the US -- where they increase costs without any justification nor recourse for the public (and insurance companies have to pay more and more exorbitant prices which results in higher healthcare costs).


People pay for prescription medicine and treatment in universal healthcare systems -- even under the NHS! I don't know what the alternative you're arguing against is, and I certainly wasn't arguing for it.


I think you're misunderstanding what I was trying to say -- the person I was responding to was arguing that taxes are only used for bad things (obvious examples include killing people overseas in illegal wars, or just run-of-the-mill corruption). My point was that taxes can be used to fund positive things, and that is what I support them being used for.

Here in Australia, the top two line items on my 2018 tax statement were social welfare and healthcare (making up almost 60% of the taxes I paid). I do wish more was spent on education (it's 4th with defence being 3rd), but I think the current distribution is already pretty clearly mostly spent on good causes. Yeah, the system could be better, but that's always a true statement.


That's a pipe dream. But more critically, the main problem with depending on individual charity for a social safety net is that when there is an economic downturn (when more people need the safety net) the number of charitable contributions will reduce. Only governments are in a position to provide stimulus packages or job programs (both of which are forms of deficit spending) -- which is the historically the only way that countries have actually been able to avoid the impacts of recessions.


If you didn't vote, then you have no right to complain -- if you did vote, then you did choose (along with the rest of your nation). If you didn't like the choices, donate to a candidate you prefer or run for office yourself.

There were recessions during the period of the gold standard -- the most obvious example is *the Great Depression*. Many economists have argued that the reason the depression lasted for such a long time was because the US government couldn't deficit spend in order to stimulate the economy (which is what has been done in effectively every subsequent recession and has helped stop the bleeding in every case where it was done properly).

The idea that the gold/silver/shiny-metal standard is where money was born from is quite simply a modern myth. In reality, money was born from debt -- the king would ask for a stick to be broken off a tree and then the value of the money was notched into the wood (the stick was split in half to allow for the detection of fraud). Thus the king had just "printed" some money -- this system was called ["tally sticks"]( and existed for an incredibly long period of time (the earliest-known examples of accounting found in archeological digs are the tracking of debts through tally sticks).


The gold standard was a historical oddity in the history of the human race, and it provably *did not work* -- the whole compulsory acquisition of gold and eventual de-coupling of the gold standard from how much gold the government actually held fiasco proves that a world economy cannot function under a gold standard. Do you think the US government took people's gold purely because they were evil? No, they did it because it was not practically possible for them to deploy monetary policies without the ability to print (or forcefully acquire) money.

I agree -- capitalism doesn't function as an economic system. Maybe we should fix that instead of changing where the money comes from. But since that is very unlikely to happen within my lifetime, I'd prefer that we use the (broken) system we have to our advantage.

I agree that teachers should be paid more, and I would be happy to pay more taxes if that happened (though the money should be diverted from wasteful military spending instead).


Which seems like a workable idea until you have Coca-Cola advertising in the middle of geography class. Also, in such a system who would set the national curriculum? You can't have a Department of Education because you just decided to no longer fun schools with taxes, so why fund a government department as well?


I don't disagree, but the solution is to elect people who don't waste money like that -- not to scrap the whole idea.

Public schools in New Zealand are very good (I'm not a Kiwi, but I know quite a few). Please don't project your US-centric views and experience to the rest of the world. Public schools are incredibly important, and not wanting to fund them is saying that children who have lower income parents shouldn't have the opportunity to have a quality education (and the quality of your early education is one of the primary factors that determines whether you will be a productive member of society).

A reminder that the Bitcoin paper was literally titled "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" not "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Savings System". The *whole purpose* ***from the outset*** was to create a system of payment that was resilient against government intervention (the first sentence of the first paragraph discusses commerce and electronic payments).








This would probably still be considered "using BTC as payment". Even in non-oppressive governments, courts take a very dim view over trying to get around the intent of a particular law.

Maybe that's how the world should work, but [it isn't]( Not to mention all of the things Edward Snowden revealed about the intelligence community.

The US has automatic copyright. This is a requirement of the Berne Convention and is a holdover of English Law originally codified in The Statute of Anne (1710).
\*However\*, the US (like most countries) has a separate system for "registered copyright". The purpose of this is to make it easier to prove in court that you own the copyrights for something -- it doesn't grant you copyright over the work. It's just used as a paper record that says "yes, XYZ registered their copyrights on ABC on DD/MM/YY". In principle you could file a copyright infringement lawsuit without registered copyrights, it's just simpler if you have already registered them.
This is different to how patents work, where a registered patent grant is the only evidence of your ownership of a patent.
