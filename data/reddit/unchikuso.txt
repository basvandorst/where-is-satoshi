I think it's more important that others *understand* bitcoin.  Once they understand it, acceptance and trust follow.
The problem is that bitcoin is somewhat technical, making it challenging to fully grasp at first.  Like you said, we have to teach others.  I find that it has more of an impact if you teach them about the significance of bitcoin rather than the fundamentals.

Yes, but i think that it depends on what you mean by trust.  Trusting companies like BitPay and Circle is harmful and not what we should be preaching.

Yes and no. Maybe better for the blockchain, but not for people. Anyone can build an op_return transaction themselves, but not everyone knows how to do that.  I could build a service that sends it on your behalf, but then you are relying on trust. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:10:49
You can spend one satoshi to timestamp data of any size on the blockchain, to prove that a statement was made, or that a document existed.  Of course you would want to include a fee on top of that to ensure confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:39:05
Peter, what mechanism/service did you use to timestamp your paper on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:28:11
I just added some more salt options.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:10:28
When brainwallet.org closed, we all had a sigh of relief.  It was known to be unsafe, yet people continued to use them with low-entropy passphrases.  When they permanently closed, I decided to roll out my own version that I believe will provide the necessary security.
Brainwallet.io uses 262,144 iterations of the time and memory-intensive scrypt key derivation function.  The personal info fields that you see are used as salts, which aid in thwarting brute force attacks.  None of your personal information ever leaves your web broser.  The only reason personal info is used is because they are effortless to remember. 
The idea of using scrypt for brainwallets was first implemented by [warpwallet]( and they get all of the credit for this.  I am offering an alternate solution that requires additional salts for enhanced security.
I encourage developers to review my code to verify the security of this website.  All source code is available on GitHub.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:04:38
262,144 = 2^18.
If brainwallet.io goes down, you'll find it on GitHub.
@_date: 2015-08-27 03:22:03
CoinCadence, here's an alternative for you.  It uses the memory-intensive scrypt function similar to WarpWallet, but with a few added features. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:03:45
The text itself is not stored on the blockchain.  A hash of the text is used to generate a Bitcoin address.  By sending bitcoin to that address, you prove that the text existed at the time the bitcoin was sent.  Our website is a public record of text that has been timestamped using this process.
@_date: 2015-08-10 05:45:44
I could add a salt and disclose it, but I feel that there would be no point to salt it in the first place.  The website is a public database of brainwallets, so anyone who visits the site can retrieve the sent funds.  
I didn't attend your presentation, but I read through your slides and I have been following what's been going on.  I think that what you are doing is great.  
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:17:33
Thanks for your feedback, Ryan.  I agree that it is trivial to find someone's name, email, phone, and birth date, but if only your email was required, an attacker could sweep through a list of bitcoin users' email addresses.  The additional info makes it so that you truly would have to be personally targeted by an attacker to be at risk.  Additionally, as minimal as it may be, having 4 salts instead of 1 can slow down an attacker because they have to try every possible combination of the ways you can format a name, phone number, and date of birth.
After giving this some thought, what I would like to do is give people the option to chose their "type" of salt that they want to use.  For example, you can chose to enter personal info, or you can switch modes and enter a username, password, and PIN code, for example.  Maybe another option would be to answer simple questions like "what is your favorite color?" (bad example, but you get the idea).  This can be implemented very easily without affecting the way it currently functions.
At first I thought that allowing blank passphrases was not a big deal since nobody would be dumb enough, but I agree with what you said.  If it can be allowed, it *will* happen.  I'll get this implemented soon.
I also love your idea of building in a random passphrase generator.  This is a great way to encourage people to use strong passphrases.  I will start looking at this in the near future.
Again, thanks for your input and keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:50:15
Yes, but the same holds true for brainwallets!  If someone guesses your passphrase, your funds are gone.
That's why you should use a very long, unique phrase that doesn't appear in literature or song.
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:33:22
If you did this, then you wouldn't be able to prove existence of the passphrase.  One must be able to recreate the bitcoin address from the text, on their own, in order to validate the timestamp.  
I'm also not concerned about brainwallet thieves for a couple reasons.  First, we are talking about a very small amount of bitcoin.  Second, I actually like the idea of the bitcoin getting "recycled" instead of being wasted.  The first confirmed transaction to the brainwallet is all that matters in this process, so we might as well allow people to claim the bitcoin after it's sent.
P.S. great job on your presentation.
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:17:20
That's great feedback and I appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:01:36
You can look at the source code.
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:18:51
Pretty much.  The text gets converted to a private key using hash algorithms.  You can see it in action at 
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:32:26
Yes, we looked into using OP_RETURN, but that relies on a middle man that you have to put trust in and send money to.  Our solution does not require you to send us any money.
@_date: 2015-07-30 04:21:28
Exactly.  You can send as little as 1 satoshi, but you also need to include a fee to ensure that the transaction gets confirmed in a timely manner.  Just by sending one transaction to that address, you prove that the text existed at that time.
@_date: 2015-07-30 04:40:31
If you timestamp a contract, a cryptographic hash of the document gets recorded on the blockchain.  If that document gets modified in any way, the hash value would change, and there would be no record of it on the blockchain.  The timestamp can be used to prove that your contract existed at the time you received it.
Timestamping is not a new concept, but we have always relied on trusted timestamping.  
By using the decentralized blockchain, we now have *trustless* timestamping.  
This idea of timestamping can be applied to any form of data, including voting.  You can validate a vote by proving that it took place before the polls closed, and you can even prove identity of the voter if the text is digitally signed.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-02-22 15:25:46
I have increased the timer to 0.5 seconds, which should allow you to type out words without it sending a hash after every keystroke.
I have considered triggering on pressing enter, but that would take away from the user experience that makes passphrase.io so unique.  As you may have noticed, passphrase.io is more than just a simple notepad.  People are having a bit of fun with it by typing out obvious passphrases and leaving behind messages for others.  There are also some messages that dynamically change as you slowly type out a word.  I'd rather keep it fun and easy to use.  People who are concerned about security can type out their passphrase elsewhere and paste it into the website.
@_date: 2016-02-22 12:52:40
This tool does not generate keys/addresses. This is a notepad. 
For an actual brainwallet, try brainwallet.io. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:11:01
I think you're generalizing the statement I made.  Of course anyone can make an OP_RETURN transaction on their own.  But if I'm building a website for people to use, I can't make the transaction on someone else's behalf unless I receive bitcoin from them, or build an online wallet that allows them to do it themselves, which relies on trust.
I understand your concern with bloating the blockchain (although technically it's not unspendable), but I believe it's inevitable that the blockchain will continue to be used for purposes other than a payment system.

I thought about this too but that would expose your passphrase so it wouldn't be secure. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:52:42
That would only be possible if you typed slowly, one letter at a time. If you type rapidly, only one hash is sent once you finish typing. There is a timer that resets after every keystroke, and the hash is only sent after the timer expires. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:54:25

Yes, but you should know that the article refers to the "classic" brainwallet that only uses one round of SHA256 to generate the keys.  I created brainwallet.io, which uses the time and memory intensive scrypt key derivation function, along with required "salt" fields that make it much harder to brute force.
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:41:53
The timer is fairly short. I can increase it if this is something that concerns people, but I also don't want to sacrifice performance. It's a fine balance.
