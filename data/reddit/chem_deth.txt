Erm, you're not putting your money into a saving's account. What you're doing is investing.
If you had bought Google shares early on, you wouldn't have thought for a second to be "saving" money. You would have been honest with yourself and called it "an investment".
You're not buying BTC to "save", but to make a profit, like most people.

A sidechain is pretty much [the logical next step]( in blockchain development, I think it's a low-hanging fruit. As always, the people with the biggest voice will get recognition. But in the end, it's the implementation that's more important. A working example is worth more than 100 papers!

OSX is BSD at the core... and their MBPs are pretty amazing laptops, however overpriced they might be. The Mavericks update was concerned with power users in my opinion, unlike what had been done since Snow Leopard. I went from 10.6 to 10.9, the in-between was fluff imho.

1. I spent all the money I could on BTCs about a year ago. That was 50$. I couldn't afford the fees associated with wire transfers - the ones with cash deposits were lower. It was easy for me to walk in a bank with a 50$ bill. Unfortunately Virtex does not allow this anymore.
2. They do not claim any fees with cash deposits. I haven't seen them written on their website, and I've looked for them.
3. It depends on which operating system you're using. Trivial to set up in Linux or OS X, probably easy on Windows too. I'm using Apple Mail with GPGTools.
4. You have to get verified to be able to withdraw and deposit fiat, but not to trade in BTC/LTC/PPC. Verification implies ID and utility bill.

Do you trust them with that much money? That's the question you have to ask yourself. I have not deposited money with them yet, only performed BTC trades. The platform seems well oiled, but there isn't much volume yet, so we don't know how it performs under stress.
It also depends on how big a part of your investment budget 100K USD is. If it represents 100%, please don't proceed. If it represents something like 5% of your portfolio and you understand the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, then I suggest you place your money in more than one exchange. You'll hedge your money against potential hacks or DoS attacks, and you'll also be able to profit from arbitrage opportunities.

BTC Capital? BTC is decentralized. There needs to be no "capital" because this means power is concentrated there.
I've never been to Berlin but I'd love to (any German BTC Patrons out there?) but I have to say both Vancouver and Montreal are great cities. Both are cosmopolitan, Vancouver being sort of a door to Asia and Montreal a gate to Europe. Although from my experience, Montreal seems to have a more diverse set of cultural communities, the city itself being almost flawlessly bilingual. Strong Luso, Italian, Latin, Cantonese and Arab communities. My experience in Vancouver was a bit less diverse. Seemed to me like there were mostly Asians and English Canadians, with some french spoken here and there.

I think the fact that bitcoins are so profitable to early adopters and that the currency is deflationary will kill it before any software bugs.
I don't think there's a doubt in anybody's mind that currencies of the future will not be controlled by central banks and governments _as they were_, but it would be silly to think that BTC is the end all be all.

I share the same goals as you. I just think that after the Bitcoin experiment, lessons will be learned, Ph. D. theses written, and better alternatives devised.
BTW, I will _not_ remove my investment if the exchange rate drops. The currency being deflationary is a security that will make it hard for BTCs to be worth nothing, at least until all of them are mined or lost.

His target audience are the skeptics and oldies. I'm sure an intelligent man like him knows what's at stake here: the realization by the masses that _any_ currency is as good as another. The realization by the masses that what makes a currency is simply "the belief that other people will accept them as payment." The bitcoin experiment is twofold: an experiment in monetary policy _and_ in social economics education. His text makes me think he finds the latter more dangerous than the former.
Nobody here claims that BTC will bring the doom of government backed money - I'm sure we're all for paying _some_ amount of taxes in order to have public infrastructure. I'm also confident that most people agree that a government backed currency is currently the easiest way to do so. But BTC fills another need. It's a convenient _tool_, just like paper money is, in its own right. And a tool has value in that it enables you to _do_ something, which in bitcoin's case is to pseudonymously, securely and _easily_ transfer wealth in a way that escapes third-party interference (i.e. banks).
Sadly, the guy sounds like an old fart. He dismisses bitcoin on the premise that it derives its value "purely from self-fulfilling prophecy, the belief that other people will accept them as payment", but then argues that USD is better _because you know you can pay your taxes with it_. Coming from him, I am certain that this apparent contradiction was intentional, to catch unwary readers off guard and give them the impression that BTC is a bad thing.
He gets some credit for being true to his "New Keynesian" self.

Well, I think it's you who missed the point. His argument is _intentionally_ flawed. A 1$ bill does not have intrinsic value other than the fact you can pay your taxes with it. By itself, it's worth nothing more than the anticipation of other people accepting it.
A bitcoin, while not suitable to pay your taxes, enables you to transfer wealth _based on the expectation that others will accept it_ (and other qualities). People want to use it, therefore it has value. Perfectly legitimate. Just like USD. But if you want to hoard it, then you will be rewarded with deflation, unlike fiat currencies. So BTC is not a currency like fiat money, nor is it a commodity like gold. It has characteristics of both, and it takes some time getting used to.


If the man was 20 years old, he would be committing logic crime. But because he's probably not too tech saavvy, I doubt he's aware of the social condition of bitcoin. Just look around the internet communities such as this one. I'm pretty sure he doesn't spend much time around here ;) There is social acceptance of BTC, on the internet. But his definition of what is social probably doesn't include internet communities.
Be honest with yourself and realize that such an intelligent man wasted a golden opportunity to broaden his horizons. Maybe he's too old. Maybe he really doesn't get it.

Yes, you can have money in all of the exchanges if you wish. But that won't help you doing arbitrage.
Say you have 10 BTC and 100$USD on exchanges A and B. Rate of exchange A is double that of exchange B, and both charge the same fees. You wish to make a profit, so you do the following:
1. Buy 100$ worth of BTC on exchange B and send the coins to exchange A.
2. Sell BTC on exchange A to make profit.
3. Send your money on exchange A to exchange B to buy more cheap BTC.
The two first steps could be done in under a minute if you don't have a bot, but you still wouldn't receive your bitcoins until much later - which means probable loss of double margin. Even if transferring BTCs can take some time, step 3 is also rate-limiting. There would have to be a way for you to transfer your fiat money from one exchange to the other really quickly to be able to make a profit.
So basically, you're limited to one cycle per ~10 minutes per wallet: sell on exchange A, buy on exchange B, wait for transaction to be officialised.
This is enough time for the markets to equilibrate.
I've lost money doing that. For it to be really profitable, you'd need a lot of cash money available at all times in more than one exchange, as well as a large amount of bitcoins available for selling. But you're still stuck with a ~10 min wait between cycles per account.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:40:54
If you want the high exchange rate, you need to sell your BTCs on CAVIRTEX.
I'm deriving a formula for the profit made by switching funds between two exchanges of the same currency (most basic scenario). I'll post it up once I'm done, and then maybe work on more complicated cases like 2 exchanges with different currencies, or three exchanges 1 currency, or three exchanges different currencies, etc.
Not trivial (for me), but I'm sure I can get a nice formula for the most basic case.

Arbitrage with Bitcoin is very hard to pull off, especially in crazy times like last week. Transferring funds from one account to another takes long enough for the opportunity to pass. To arbitrage profitably, you'd need some way of predicting price shifts.

You are both right in the sense that there indeed are people who think like that, and would qualify as bitbugs. I also agree with you concerning the impossibility of a currency "untouched by human frailty". But the way you and he framed it, "they" means "every bitcoin proponent/user". It is this generalization which is at the core of our disagreement.
Bitcoin is a tool. It serves a purpose. Its purpose is to enable people to transfer wealth anonymously, securely and without third-party influence. It has certain characteristics that make it unsuitable as an everyday currency, such as its high volatility, fixed money supply and resulting deflation (although these can be argued not to be a problem). But these are also characteristics that commodities like gold and silver have. Just like paper money, if people do not wish to do trade with it, a bitcoin shall be of no use. But it seems to have intrinsic value in the fact that it provides a solution to the problem of uninhibited, anonymous and decentralized money transfer. From where I stand, bitcoin is a hybrid form of money. But it's still perfectly legitimate money, with its own characteristics, as long as people wish to do trade with it.
Krugman seems to have a very sophisticated but elitist view of what a currency is:


This ignores what's at the core of bitcoin, other than a piece of software: there exists an online community of people who want to engage in trade with it. This community is not bound by borders or jurisdictions, race or language, religion or political and electoral systems. Bitcoin enables them to trade freely, and thus has value, _even if these people do not form a society in the way Krugman intends it_. There is no difference between paying for a hamburger in bitcoins or in paper money, or in gold. What's important is that the person on the receiving end agrees to be paid in said way, because they assume others will reciprocate.
Bitcoins may not be the best vehicle of wealth for paying your groceries and government taxes, but for online transactions, it works great. It derives its value from this simple fact.
Bitcoin is just one incarnation of a cryptocurrency, and so might not be used anymore in 20 years. But the idea behind bitcoin, the possibilities it enables, are here to stay. This is what, I think, Mr. Krugman doesn't fully appreciate. Of course there are people with differing agendas regarding bitcoin, such as drug trafficking or eradication of all other currencies. But the fact is, most people are way less idealistic, and see it as a vehicle of wealth useful in certain situations. This alone justifies Bitcoin.
Thank you for arguing with me.

Bitcoin is not:
- A currency
- A stock
- A commodity
- An option
- A derivative
- ...
Bitcoin can be a mix of these things. It's not _purely_ anything. At the moment, we're definitely seeing characteristics of stocks and FOREX markets. At the moment, it's no use in buying BTC to then buy other goods. BTC's purchasing power has consistently been going up. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't invest, on the contrary. For the time being, Bitcoin's most apparent characteristic is that of store of value. Speculation is what's driving the market at the moment.
I hope we'll get to see BTC used as an everyday currency, but I doubt that'll happen soon.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:24:27
But it is not irrational _at this point in time_. The reason you won't send me 10 BTC for free is not because you think there's value in the proof-of-work, but because you're anticipating an increase in the _exchange rate_ with USD.
At this point in time, Bitcoin's "value" is measured with exchange rates. Sure, some people believe in the inherent value of a proof-of-work effort, no double spend, public ledger and all the other things that make Bitcoin Bitcoin. But there are also a lot of people who don't give a damn about this and just want to make money. This pushes BTC to take on the role of a commodity, not a currency.
I'm convinced we're building the future, but I'm not going to fool myself. If you manage other people's money, you have a duty to pay them back. That's not irrational, no matter what investment we're talking about.
The fact that the value of an experiment wishing to facilitate the online exchange of goods and services as well as promoting economic independence from the state is measured in exchange rates is indicative of the experiments frailty and youth. It's quite normal for people to measure BTC in USD, because we have no real idea what digital proof-of-work is worth - it's such a new concept for humanity. Therefore we put it against the USD, where you have the biggest military force in the world, with infrastructure and millions of dutifully tax-paying citizens backing it. This makes things easier to put into perspective, but also forces Bitcoin to be a commodity, not a currency.
What will you do if there's a crash tomorrow? Buy more and hold, because it might jump back to 1000:1.

This is a bad idea. Bitcoins are not prime for everyday commerce. It's either too young, so the rates have not stabilized yet, or congenitally defective in an as-yet unknown way.
Time will tell if we can use BTC for commerce, but at the time being, you would be ill-advised to buy BTC just to spend them _unless_ what you want to buy is only sold/made available by Bitcoins, which would be surprising.
At least with fiat you know it'll depreciate - with BTC, you won't know how much humanity values it until quite a while. The current rates might be the biggest we ever see, or they might be a bargain. We don't know.

No matter how much absolute bitcoins there will every be, you can always try to own 51% of them. You'll drive up prices by buying, increasing demand, and therefore each buy costs you more than the last.
