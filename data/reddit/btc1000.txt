Well, I called Capital One today, pretending to be Roman, and gave them the account number and social engineered my way around a bit.  I couldn't verify his EIN because it turns out it isn't findable in my deep search engines (like EINfinder.com) and he may not even have one.  But... I did manage to get some information form the account rep, who could tell me that a."my account was NOT frozen. :) and that there were no restrictions on sending or receiving.  and b.that the account is still receiving deposits as we speak.  ie.  their account is not closed.  IT MAY BE SOON, but as we speak not yet.  :)  So get your money out by ACH if you can, while you still can.  Why the fuck else would they just freeze trading????  Why not just tell everybody to get their money into bitcoins and remove it, and give them like a month warning to do so, along with stopping accepting incoming to the bank account??  This only reeks of rip-off.  There is NO REASON to suspend trading when you're money is already there.  This is a theft.

I'd give anything for his number.  :) 
Unfortunately, he isn't findable in any people search database that I have.  There is only 1 Roman Shtylman in all the US and he's 58 lives in Georgia.  Even the S.S.N and DOB databases I have access to have no record of a Roman Shtylman, -anywhere.  EIN databases are empty for "Bitfloor, inc." in ANY state.   I start to think it's a fake name for protection.  Makes sense.  -sevenmoonsofknight
