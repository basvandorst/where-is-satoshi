Bitcoin is the exact opposite of "internet freedom". Perhaps you should look into how it works. All transactions are public and traceable. It is as anonymous as going to a store and renting a mask that requires your ID as deposit. You can operate 'anonymously' with the mask on, but there is a record of you via your ID.
Dont be fooled. Educate yourself

but why would someone work for a whole month for a bitcoin rate if at the end of the month they could be super rich or broke poor. either way their rent is due, their credit cards are due, etc. 
compound that if you have real responsibilities (a family, medical expenses,etc) and getting paid in such a speculative currency would be suicidal
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:16:14
because a credit card doesnt have the capability of the blockchain that keeps track of all transactions and movement of every bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:36:28
of course they would..they can take a fractional fee for every transaction they enable. in addition, apple could cut out credit cards entirely or partially further increasing their profits

with all due respect this is just stupid.
bitcoin is not an end all. something better can come along. then what will your bitcoin be worth? people will migrate to that system and exiting out of bitcoins. its like saying im going to be a member of myspace no matter what..then all your friends jump on facebook. the exact same thing can (and will) happen with bitcoin.
there is no 'long term' with bitcoin. why would they be. its just a technology and technologies change and are replaced
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:04:42
credit card system and bitcoin system are not equivalent.
bitcoin payments are just one application. bitcoin can also be used for authorization of something. for example - and to keep it simple - a door lock. you can present your private key qr code and the reader will ping bitcoin and authorize your entry.
these kinds of applications are not possible with credit cards..yes one can conceive that one would swipe a credit card to open the door. but thats not what that technology was used for. bitcoin would be more appropriate.
so bitcoin can do everything credit card can do plus a lot more ...and in all case its about control
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:17:42

the block chain IS the central authority. ever wonder why its called a 'chain'. 
also they can ban you from using bitcoin. they can say every single bitcoin out there is black market and you can only use the official coin.
considering the 666 is during a world dictatorship where 1/3 of the world has been slaughtered already, im pretty sure you wont have a choice
bitcoin is a precursor and enabling technology. everything about 666 can be literally accomplished with bitcoin/qr codes

what do you mean. technology enables this sytem. bitcoin is a concept in that direction. im not claiming its the end all..im claiming as of today 666 could be implemented with qr codes and the bitcoin system.
but now that i have your attention let me ask you. what is your conclusion if you have to wear a mark on your forehead and on your right hand to transact? you going to say its a coincidence? confirmation bias? someone playing a joke on christians?
and when they make you bow down and worship this 'beast' will you still be saying 'death to the christians' and laughing it off?

do you feel safe with using an iphone that has been shown to track all your moves, conversations, and phone calls?
no..what about android which does the same thing by google?
if you dont, then it wont matter as millions dont care..they want their starbucks with iCoins and they want it now.
the key here is that everyone has an iphone/android. so the adoption rate by both user and merchant would be the breakthrough bitcoin cant achieve without a central player

of course they could. nothing precludes someone from transacting without the mark. thats the whole point. either you get it and you can be in the economy or you dont and you are left in the cold. and since its in the forehead everyone else can see if your in or out.
perhaps you should see a pastor or preschool teacher. its quite clear a 5 year old can understand it

@_date: 2013-12-10 21:21:23


it also doesnt talk about the internet, but yet we know thats a global system that can be used to implement a mark system. nor are cars or airplanes or reddit mentioned. are we to think those will all disappear before the mark arrives because its not mentioned? 
bitcoins public ledger is the same - its a technology/concept that the mark system would require if you want to make everyones transactions recorded.


yes obviously we arent in a society that a mark is mandated. im pointing out that bitcoin is an enabling technology for such a system


right now qr codes represent any arbitrary data..numbers, urls, pictures, etc. so its not specific to 666. 
in addition 666 is the name of the beast. and it asks for wisdom to understand. so perhaps that hints at a calculation. perhaps there is a name/phrase that computes to 666.66666666 etc
what im observing is a mark (qr code) can be used to buy and sell via bitcoin. this did not exist in the mainstream before.

how do you setup a wallet not tied to you?
lets say you write it out on bathroom wall, and your payer writes it up and sends you the coins. fine..they dont know who you are..you dont know who they are.
but now when you go to move those coins around you must log in at some point to move those coins around. unless you do it on public computers and cash out person to person.
i just dont see how you can escape tainting this so called anonymity if your computer (and all its already established tricks to identify you) will be used to manage that public address
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:44:04


Bitcoin's design is a mistakenly thought to be against central authority. In fact, it allows for complete tracking of every transaction. every single bitcoin can be traced from owner to owner. there is no hiding from bitcoin because everything is accounted for in the public ledger.
the illusion is that its as anonymous as cash. but in fact its cash with a record of everyone who touches that cash. 
add to this the fact that bitcoin will be used for other kinds of interactions. for example the system can be used to open/close real world locks. show your private qr code and the system pings bitcoin to see if its legit. then the door opens. there is now a record of you having opened that door. think about what that means for privacy and human tracking. its much more than 'buy and sell'...its allow or deny
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:48:23


because you can buy your iCoins from an established trusted brand called apple stores and iTunes. right now its a headache and a risk to get a bitcoin (find an exchange, ids, bank link up, qr codes, etc)
apple offers the conveience and apps and network to compete. much more added value

@_date: 2013-12-12 01:03:01
really..what makes you think its not literal? there is a multitude of verses that talk about it in a literal sense (people who take it break out in boils, angels warn about it, people are killed because of it,etc)
yes there is a symbolic meaning because you are putting a symbol (mark) and visibly demonstrating it. in addition in revelations 22 it talks about those that are in the city of God have Gods name on their forehead. so its clear taking the mark is a symbolic gesture. but it is also a literal mechanism
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:03:29

the number is important as is the worship of the beast
the public ledger is not mentioned in the bible. but the public ledger is an idea that would enable worldwide tracking of every single transaction.
the internet is also not mentioned..but we now see its a worldwide system of communcations that enables absolute surveillance anywhere
conclusion: internet + public ledger + qr code/number for payment address = a mark of the beast system
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:16:55
yes i agree the bitcoin protocol can do more..and there is lots of other applications of it we will yet to see

@_date: 2013-12-17 04:04:03
you can download a copy of that website and run it off your own laptop. you can buy a new laptop, go deep into a cave with no wifi access..then load the bitaddress html page in your browser.
once you have your wallet/keys generated, you can smash the laptop with a rock in the cave. then dump parts of it on your way back home along the way.
at least thats how im doing it. and dont you dare find my cave!
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:30:15
then your problem is solved
currently you would only want to use bitcoin if you want to speculate along with everyone else. or begin hoarding costs with other peoples dollars.
if you are selling a digital good then bitcoin is ideal. doesnt cost you produce, store, send out..then btc is awesome

@_date: 2013-12-06 08:37:54
the value of bitcoin can (and does!) plummet within seconds. there is no way he can 'liquidate the amount he wants' with guarantees. to sell a bitcoin he must have someone to buy it. when price falls sharply there are no buyers. 
apple and google have immense piles of cash on hand right now..something like 40-60 BILLION of reserves. the total market cap for bitcoin right now is 12 billion?
what if google/apple came out with their own bitcoin. And back stopped its price with their own cash/stock. what if apple built it into their next iOS update. so every single iphone and every single android had a built in client . and what if they gave away free wallets with free coins of their own already..just to jump start the economy.
it would be a branded version of the bitcoin idea. so what do you do if you are a bitcoin holder and its not compatible with their system? or what if it were but their conversion rate was really poor?
see what im getting at..bitcoin is a technology. and its so new and there is so many giants and threats out there that can completely kill it.
@_date: 2013-12-08 09:28:47
dont even compare gold to bitcoin. 
gold is something real. bitcoin is something imaginary.
