I have a project that’s just getting off the ground if you are interested. 
Send me a pm with an email address I can send the white paper to
If you’re really interested in projects that will change the world, mine is a bold place to start.

There is a lot of very uninformed hit pieces being circulated by the media at the moment in an attempt to scare people away from bitcoin and cryptocurrencies....I wonder who could be funding such poorly researched and written hit pieces? Hmm...

I like the answers so far and would just like to disagree with the initial premise....even if someone where to run a quantum computer and somehow manage to generate a in use address, this wouldn’t be enough in itself to kill bitcoin....I would say generating two or more in use addresses is where there would be worry. Ones statistically interesting good luck but irrelevant good luck..the other would imply something more

You are misunderstanding two things.
First, Exchanges aren’t opting out of it. Exchanges use an internal accounting system to avoid transaction fees. This allows for day trading where one coin might trade 10-100 different hands without ever actually being traded on the BlockChain. 
Second, lightning network itself is a second layer solution so it has to be opted into by the user who has to chose to utilize a lightning payment channel. 
I don’t know anything about your second question. Hopefully someone else can help you there

I live in the us, and I know plenty of people who's premiums are fucked from the aca.....that's what socialist programs do, they fuck the middle class for the poor, making everyone equally poor....but that's besides my point. The point I was making bringing up the aca is that more often than not, a proposed bill or act or program from the government often does the exact opposite of its name. Only a moron would look at what they've done to the dollar and still take them seriously when they say they want to "help" with Bitcoin.

Without access to any of their hardware you are most likely SOL on anything unless they backed it up to the cloud and you can access that. If you do have access to one of their devices(or a cloud based copy) it should be possible to either find a GUI wallet and try to guess at the password or find a wallet file you can upload to a wallet and do the same. 
What i have described here is true of every cryptocurrency(as far as i know). 
Other than this type of stuff, Any other type of "asset recovery" would need to be something facilitated by a third party service to begin with(ex: a exchange wallet like coinbase might be able to do something for you). 
Edit: there is also a method of storing funds called a paper wallet that uses a mnemonic phrase as an encryption  method. This would most likely be a piece of  paper with a string of random words

Brand recognition....a "cryptodollar" backed by the us government and tied to the dollar would have a huge, established support base. Sure it wouldn't offer any type of decentralization or privacy, but it would be backed by the us dollar(petro dollar).

Is impossible to say, this is still a tech in its infancy. On one hand the first to the race rarely even finishes (MySpace, Friendster, etc) but on the other hand, there is a lot to be said for brand name recognition(every MP3 player was an iPod). 
Finally, we have yet to see a government backed crypto, and that's the real threat in my opinion.

You too....I do definitely see your side of it. Hopefully enough people wake up to Bitcoin before we see something like that then this whole convo will be a mute point
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:54:10
Ok, I get what you are saying, that the EDA and  transactions will keep BCH alive, but as BCH fans are so quick to point out, fees are super cheap. So as the price goes down due to the inflation in the supply of available BCH and it bottoms out at all coins mined, your going to end up with a inflated chain(all coins available means huge supply) and next to no demand(price is down due to inflation)....all of which means that miners could be earning 1000 coins per block solved and it still won't be enough to keep them as incentive because the price is at .07 cents a coin(randomly picked low number). The EDA is only a short term life support that keeps miners mining the chain and trading off the BCH for BTC.

@_date: 2018-06-05 22:12:37
I hear you on that fear, but really it’s not just Bitcoin they have to stop or figure out how to control anymore. They now face an emerging token economy that is step by step providing better alternatives to what governments claim to do. I would say research more than just bitcoin because there’s a lot more to the revolution than just BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:35:25
Maybe, but they would have to face a critical  decision like block size and also not have an official founder. Ethereum faced a similar issue after the DAO hack and I would say it went way smoother because vitalik and the other devs where there to help guide the community and where open to discussion. This is stark contrast to what happened with bitcoin because satoshi wasn’t there to settle the issue 
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:45:28
I would hardly say vitalik is a dictator by any means. Having an official founder doesn’t make a the currency magically centralized. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:50:15
That’s very true at the moment. I know it’s an unpopular opinion but I think that will change here in the future. With all the infighting in the bitcoin community and the emerging utility token  model newer crypto’s are putting forth bitcoin will really need to step up what it’s offering if it wants to remain king. 
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:47:59
I think our best answer to funding public goods lies in the work being done on open source DeFi protocols and Decentralized Autonomous Organizastions(DAO's). Now I understand that's probably confusing if you arnt familiar with the concepts but I would urge you to look into them. Start with DAO's and then look into the stuff being done over at compound finance. 
As a easy to understand short intro to the type of things DeFi makes possible(as well as how it could be used to fuel public services) check out this video on a DeFi program called Pool Together, a Decentralized No-Loss lottery based around MakerDAO's Dai token and Compound finances Decentralized lending protocol.....

The ever growing node storage problem(I.e the fact that as a chain grows more, more storage is required to run a full node) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:02:29
On a side note, it’s interesting that your problem only applies to  PoW and not PoS....perhaps this type of compression would still be applicable to PoS if it turns out not to work for PoW....

Yes, but did it help you check your privilege? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:25:55
Hmm, ok thanks for the clarification....I was under the false understanding that coins where stored on private keys which are stored in blocks when transactions are made  and as their amounts are updated those transactions add that information to new blocks making all the older transaction data solely serve the purpose of showing a record of transactions....if that where the case deleting really old information wouldn’t delete coins, just the transaction histories of them(which up to a certain point in the past everyone already agreed upon their Occurrence so that data seemed like it was no longer needed)....if coins themselves are what’s stored on blocks this reasoning no longer makes since.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:41:41
You can’t, it’s frozen....in exchanges! Lmao

Na, just seemed like the comment that needed to be there 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:59:06
That’s why all of 2017’s transaction data would remain on the new “nova” block(I like the name by the way), to retain some semblance of POW, so a bad actor would have to somehow make these adjustments to the new nova block, then add that data on top which I don’t think they could do without changing the hash of the nova block(a nova blocks hash would have to be identical to the hash of the last block it’s replacing(I.e the last block mines on dec.31’st 2016)). He would then need to push out his new update and garner 90% node approval to implement his version.
Holy run on sentence Batman! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:08:23
Well, my thoughts are that all nodes in existence hold all that information the same right? That makes  at the very least all the information about the amounts stored in wallet addresses that have been updated since dec 31 2016 redundant/useless because everyone agrees on it....to put it more concretely couldn’t a hardfork and a node update simply delete all the redundant and or useless information and just keep what’s absolutely necessary stored in this new nova block(I’m thinking things like wallets that haven’t transacted since dec 31 2016.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:40:35

Your crazy.....if anything, Ethereum is  coin to watch at the moment because it has a very real chance of being king.

@_date: 2018-04-05 04:46:47
I could be wrong but I think they are counting on the rest of the block header to keep things distinguishable. Between that and each transaction having a unique transaction hash I think blocks will remain distinguishable enough for the blockchain to remain intact 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:28:26
Your right that it does depend on the time stamp as far as difficulty, which is determined by  the last 2048 blocks average time( if I remember right)....I would imagine that if done properly( say with a soft fork) , the “y2k time” (for lack of a better term) could just be used as the beginning point for the next 2048 blocks and everything should work just fine as it’s the time differences that matter, not the time itself....this could be problematic though if the “y2k time” where to occur say, in the middle of the 2048 block period cause this would lead to a messed up difficulty for that period. Even that though would correct immediately after the next 2048 period.....it’s entirely possible I’m missing something here but that makes since to me as I understand the protocol 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:51:22
Wow that was really hostile for me making an off hand comment. You really proved your point. With Viral like that in the community I’m sure it would totally survive.
