Arb bots would most likely push the price down on bitfinex.  Also, it would be crazy to allow an arb bot to place a trade that big.  You'd most likely see a series of opposite trades on both exchanges until the prices converged.

This seems like the most likely explanation.  Someone probably wants to sell a huge position and thinks that by spiking the price they can unload gradually at a better price.  Will be interesting to watch what happens.

It's true that fees are wayyy to high right now.  However, remember that bitcoin is supposed to last 1000s of years.  In that timeframe, it's reasonable to take a few extra years to build more robust solutions i.e. segwit + lightning vs short terms hacks.

It does matter for the long term.  Bitcoin won't just magically succeed one day.  A lot of things need to go right for that to happen.  Yes, that will take time, but things like price manipulation help ensure they won't happen at all.

segwit wasn't activated via uasf.  it was activated through miner consensus, partially due to the threat of uasf.

It does actually have a design philosophy, which is to stay as similar to the original white paper as possible.  They’re whole existence is based on that.
But your right that the “community” is a small group of rich investors and paid celebrity shills.  I still have yet to meet a real BCH supporter in real life.

I'm a little confused what this is supposed to illustrate.  All I see is that neither has gained much traction and both are lagging severely to Paypal.  Nice to see that, if there's a competition between the two, Bitcoin is winning.

That's what I was thinking.  As much as I don't like the actions and positions that Bitmain has taken over the years (killswitch what?), this actually makes a lot of sense.  It's always plugged in, and connected to the internet.  It reminds me in some ways of the early vision of 21.co.

In this case, I'm willing to guess that Charlie is very wealthy also.  I personally don't find Roger Ver persuasive at all.  He's always talking over people and going on bizzare rants.  Although maybe I don't qualify as a "non-technical" audience member.
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:27:07
If you mine an empty block then it would take 20 minutes for the next batch of txs to be confirmed.  It would only make sense if there were no txs in the mempool.  Looking at the graph, it doesn't seem that's the case.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:20:31
This is fair and I appreciate your response.  I should be more respectful towards people who favor a larger block size.
I acknowledge that 2mb, or even 8mb, is a reasonable block size.  However, the network will still be vulnerable to congestion at a larger scale.  Central entities may have a economic or political inventive to spam the network to force additional block size increases in the future.
I want Bitcoin to be the financial system that dominates the next 2000 years.  Taking two years to activate segwit is insignificant on this timeframe.  IMO the most important thing to make this happen is to keep the network as decentralized as possible.
Just my opinion.  I do respect yours.
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:24:39
I've thought about this.  I'm not a lawyer, but it doesn't make sense to me that a government could regulate bitcoin if it's deemed a currency.  Of course the government can regulate dollars because they create them.  Dollars have value because they're backed by the "full faith and credit"of their issuing government.
Bitcoins are essentially just a mathematical proof.  They're not created by anyone, and their value is secured by nothing other than supply and demand.  There's nothing tangible about a Bitcoin.  It doesn't make sense to me that one government could pass one set of laws about Bitcoin, while another could impose a different set of laws.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:17:23
Yeah I've been buying through bitfinex.  Are the any alternatives?
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:01:02
It's not cheap.  The price seems low but the market cap is really high.  Not saying it won't go higher, but saying it's cheap is like saying that ripple is cheap.
It is really cool tech though and a refreshing take on crypto.  I bought a pretty large position.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:06:22
I’m getting tired of these videos.  These people clearly weren’t around in 2014 or prior crashes.  I wouldn’t be surprised if bitcoin falls under $1000 at some point.
The only thing that matters is that there’s a finite supply and if bitcoin becomes a real currency then the value would have to be unthinkably high.  There’s absolutely no way to know if this will happen in 1, 10, or 100 years, or never.  Sorry.
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:24:00
Be careful.  There might just be some point where bitcoin implements a POW change (ie UASF), in the face of a 51% attack or something else.  I hope it never comes to that, but we can't say for sure it never will.
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:17:25

The intended message of the fees is pretty clear: "BCH is way cheaper than Bitcoin".  However, you haven't implemented segwit, 40 sat/byte is *way* too high recently, and getting a tx in the next block really isn't that important for online purchases (the vendor can wait a few blocks to ship the product).  How do you feel justified in fragmenting the BTC community, which definitely stunts adoption, if you're not doing anything to reduce fees on your end?
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:21:58
Meh.  It's a little different this time.  In the long term this will all blow over.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:35:47
Yeah but for the past year the discussion here has been dominated by price discussion.  Literally all I ever saw were crappy memes about the price.  It’s good to see the dialog shift over he past few weeks.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:55:20
Have you been following what's going on?  BCH has a scheduled hard fork every 6 months (crazy I know).  CSW thinks his patents cover something called OP_DSV which ABC adds to the protocol in tomorrows fork, so he launched a 51% attack against BCH to prevent any OP_DSV txs from occurring.  It's really unbelievable to watch.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:42:14
Why?  I would keep some.  BCH has a pretty strong community.  Enough so that they’re a force to be reckoned with.  Might as well keep some on hand as a hedge.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:23:13
It's the BCH split.  Jihan said he intends to fight CSW to death, and will move BTC hash power to BCH.  CSW correctly points out that both sides will need to fund this hash war by selling BTC.  Centralized mining is a bad thing.  Who knew?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:08:22
It's more profitable to mine BTC, and as the ratio of hash/price on BCH goes up it will only become more profitable.  Jihan is only incentivized to match SV dollar for dollar to keep a 51% advantage.  Bitmain is a for-profit company, and will keep as much hash on BTC as they can through this.  When it's over, all that hash will return to BTC.  I don't expect this to change much in the long run.
@_date: 2019-01-16 22:05:38
I like the name.  Will this be decentralized and censor-proof, or is the only selling point that it supported crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:39:07
He's been making pretty inconsistent statements recently.  Made favorable statements about bcash, and advocated for a disastrous POW change that would decimate the hash rate.  He's an owner of bitcoin.org so he does have some power.
@_date: 2018-02-18 00:52:01
I agree with you, but If you suppose that CW tipped himself off then he wants people to see this video.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:15:22
It's probably just speculation and jitters (and whales trying out outsmart each other).  Bitcoin is *much* stronger than BCH.  Regardless, no one really thought CSW could successfully 51% BCH.  He's backed by Calvin Ayre, who's a billionaire.  It's not clear how much hash and money both sides will waste before this is settled.

I think that over time most altcoins will die off.  We're just seeing a boom right now because we're still in the very early days.  I see a future where Bitcoin replaces Ethereum as the "do everything" currency, and only a few altcoins like Monero and Litecoin survive due to special circumstances.

As we learning, bitcoin is really hard to change.  It's a pipe dream that you could change the POW without creating a new contentious fork.  Bitmain would keep mining sha256 and claim the new chain is an altcoin, and meanwhile the bch folks would be having a field day.
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:53:23
