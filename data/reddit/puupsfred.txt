Misery is going to happen with or without Bitcoin, it has no part in it. Bitcoin offers a way out for some and a new beginning for a monetary system after the collapse. Its like the light at the end of the tunnel. When you reach it, you have died to arrive in a better place.
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:16:50
Ok, so you are talking about a technical failure, right? How large is the chance of this happening?  
  
How large is the chance for a (perceived) conceptual failure, where half the network wants to stick with the old chain and half wants to stick with the new?

@_date: 2014-02-20 23:57:18
I would also like to stress the point that if MtGox fails only 2-3 real fully compliant exchanges remain left in the world to deal business with!  
Bitstamp has almost no known banking partners besides Unicredit and its legal status in Slovenia is unknown. Btc-e is way more shady then MtGox ever was and could be prosecuted by either Cyprus or Russia any minute for dealing in BTC. All the Chinese exchanges live on the edge of extinction in their home legislature. The US too expensive and hostile for any new start ups to grow, see the man likes of Bitinstant, CampBX, etc.. No, Coinbase is not a real exchange!  
So in any case, you better be happy if MtGox survives and recovers just in case things get ugly for the other 2.

Alright, at least its not going on anymore. Whoever started this at Gox probably also did it on the other exchanges to the same extent, only those never said anything about it and carry the same loss (if any) as MtGox right now. I wonder if their pockets are equally deep as Gox's. At least on the BTC side of the balance sheet, I doubt it (since Gox started to accumulate BTCs much earlier in the game when they were worth much less).

One thing worth mentioning is that with Mastercoin (or XCP Counterparty) you can create an asset on the protocol like "Goxcoin" and treat it like a new chain or coin. This way you could also trade decentralized (Counterparty) and receive dividends on your shares. The proposed turning of Gox into a publicly held company could be performed that way.

No its a terribly injust process: imagine you are an **alleged** drug dealer, so while the FBI is investigating the case, they seize your house, car, pets and everything else they think you have bought with proceeds of your illegal activities, while the case is still ongoing, they sell everything to the highest bidder, meanwhile your family has to relocate because they have become homeless. It turns out the allegations were baseless after 1 year or so and you get the money from the auctions but have lost everything you once had for a crime you didnt commit and all they give you back is the cash, which is probably less then what you payed for.

I actually think the whole Ethnocoin idea, basically reduced to the air drop idea of verifiable consuments, is great.

If done right, this model could actually pierce its way into mass adoption.

I liked the earlier "Bank Run" proposal in the Bitcointalk forums where essentially both set aside an appropiate amount as their "colleteral" or refund denominated in BTC, lets say 30% of the amount that is to be traded and lock that up in a n-out-of-m-transaction. If one doesnt deliver his part of the transaction he/she doesnt get his/her colleteral back. Works fine with fiat and bank accounts too and is pretty untraceble from your bank account to Bitcoin transactions (in theory).

Mastercoin (like XCP Counterparty) has a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) now, that is running on the network upheld by its users. You can trade MSC for BTC surrogates, which can be exchanged for real BTC at the issuer of the surrogate (I think they are working on it).

Mastercoin (like XCP Counterparty) has a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) now, that is running on the network upheld by its users. You can trade MSC for BTC surrogates, which can be exchanged for real BTC at the issuer of the surrogate (I think they are working on it). Dont know how far their implementations are concerning the issuance of MSC derived assets. XCP and MSC DEXes are both hard tu use if you dont know what you are doing and pend a good GUI and web wallet in the coming weeks.

I agree. The worse the collapse, the worse for Bitcoin in its current state. A slight tumble of established currencies that reveal the underlying weaknesses as we have just had since 2007 is good for Bitcoin because people are interested in alternatives and they still have money to put in those risky alternatives to the proven safe havens like Gold or real estate. If it gets worse then that, people will ditch Bitcoin which is still perceived as high risk/high yield at this state and move into gold or real estate etc. in order to *preserve* wealth rather then *invest* by taking risks in order to increase it. If it gets even worse then that, think total economic collapse/Zombicalypse/Invasion, etc. people will try to gather canned foods, cigarettes, migrate to safe places to live and maybe carry their gold with them and will have absolutely no interest to buy into such a gamble unless they live in New Zealnd and are as always just too far away from everything to be affected by this.

Ive known them since June 2011 and they have always been slow, unreliable goofs with bad communication. But they are still the oldest operational (...) exchange out there. They got hacked once and never again, covered everybodies losses and even bailed out the customers of bitomat.pl. Yes, they are terrible to deal with especially if you need fiat (was always a problem) but they have stood the heat and managed their regulatory environment like no other. So yes, Im convinced, I will see my money eventually. Just give em some time, they are not the quickest but they'll get it done.

You can in fact fake the Cold Storage balance you report. Just think of the CEO of that exchange transfer all incoming new funds to a new address. Now over a couple of weeks lots of funds come in. Do those funds all come from the proceeds of deposits and fees? There is a black box between customer deposits and cold storage that is the off blockchain transactions that soleley happen on the exchanges' servers, that you could not possibly do via the blockchain because it would amount to more then the total capacity of the Bitcoin network (around 7 tx/s) at some point. So you could never know where those funds come from that end up in the cold wallets and if the priv keys associated with the exchanges funds are even controlled by the exchange and not some wealthy bitcoin holder that "rents out" his funds to make the exchange look solvent when in fact he controls the priv keys.

~~Yes but imagine the economic world order many envision with cryptos being the dominant means of exchange. With POW you have the option to engage in the risky and expensive business of mining for it but with POS you automatically gain big if you only hold on to your wealth without any productive contribution to economy or society (like securing the network by mining). Its also completely risk free AND without automated beyond choice. Now tell me which system favours the rich more?~~  
  
Ok, I start to think POS is actually better in most regards to POW..  
The risky and expensive task of mining to keep the network secure (and therefore creating a public good that everybody can use for free but nobody wants to pay for: network security) gets replaced with forging (or whatever you wanna call it), thus reducing costs, risk and increases wellfare of user by increasing network security. But it reduces economic activity that would come from mining, correct?

MtGox doesnt allow short selling, other exchanges do that only track Gox's price and fascillitate short sales (not sure whether any exchange out there keeps track of Gox price right now as its somewhat an unusual situation). Bitfinex for example does it for Bitstamp price and litecoin, some others may do it for Gox.

Yes but mining proceeds being sold off would still only account for 10% of yearly devaluation. We are currently down 70% since the last bubble high. Much more likely in my oppinion is that general market dynamics are playing out, easy to verif by a look at former bubbles and how they played out.

Interesting, I thought about this argument for some time and I guess at the core of the argument is the idea that people keep exploiting the planet's limited reserves to increase their wealth. Yes, if people would just stop to take out more then mother earth can replenish and only use their technical prowess to grow their collective wealth by technological progress and refining of products and services, endless growth is possible. The way its been done since man first walked the earth though is rather destructive and cannot go on forever. Even right now, economic growth is reduced where resources are exhausted.

Since Bitcoin devs are rather hostile towards you and other 2.0 protocols running atop of Bitcoin's blockchain:  
What are the biggest issues you see coming up between a fruitful co existence of Bitcoin and 2.0 chains that run atop it's blockchain (like Mastercoin) and how will you try to coope?
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:09:00
Thanks for giving that answer because I think you convinced me that some discussion is better then none. I guess there will always be fearmongering about any topic that can be framed that way (just think GM food, I mean when was a potato out to kill you last time you can remember?).   
Concerning public opinion shift to the right, I can see where this is coming from; European freedom of movement has lead to quite a few influxes of foreigners (mostly EU citizens) into communities that were not used to it (like those poor German buggers into Switzerland ;). That of course creates fears, even if those fears may be baseless. Until this "age of migration" hasnt settled down after the initial of the lifting of the Schengen borders (for the eastern countries) and current economic upheaval in the southern member states, there will be no calm in the political land scapes.

This whole 2-way-peg doesnt hold up under realistic conditions as BTC "parked" in one chain will be worth more then BTC parked in other chains at one point or another, just think side chain A experiences security issues for a couple of days which makes those BTC worth less for the time being because the risk of loosing them due to theft or bugs is larger then in other side chains.

ironically they have to come by those BTC eventually , driving prices up on exchanges in the mid term. Yes, they can hold out and wait for better prices to buy those Bitcoins from Bitstamp etc. which makes it more convenient for the buyer but effect on price is only delayed. OK, I see why someone with little patience or knowledge of BTC would use this method. But why not invest in the fund they provided earlier though?

I disagree, the current system may be corrupted on all levels but its still the easiest to bring about reform according to the public opinion. All the instruments are there and in general everybody agrees that corruption is bad, public participation is good and so forth, the people only have to raise their voice and start the debate to cleanse the institutions from nefarious influences and make them transparent. Only public concern has to reach a certain threshold before anything will change. Hopefully it wont take another 170 years but Im cocksure it will.

Yes, they are. Not only minerals have value that you can measure in dollars if you want to. Bio diversity and intact eco systems also have value- and very much at that. Right now billions and trillions are spent all around the globe to repair eco systems that have been damaged by human activity, such as regrowing forrests or improving water quality. Those things cost alot of money (USD 47.82 billion for reforestation in China alone, according to:  
 )  
If you would have to provide the services that eco systems all over the planet provide for free, like cleaning air or water, protecting against erosion, etc. no country could pay a bill that large, humans could hardly survive if deprived of those essential services.
  
In addition, although kind of absurd, bio diversity can be measured monetarily as well for its actual and potential use cases as food source, pest control agent, source of medical agents, etc.:  
  
















For all we know, not on that scale though. Human interference with natural habitats grows stronger over time. Many regions have already eradicated the plethora of species that once lived in them, over past millennia. Mammoths, Moas, Dodos are all examples of species well known to us, and possibly extinct by human intervention. Is this reason for apathy? Maybe people of older times were unaware of the consequences of their actions, maybe they were under existencial pressure to hunt the last one of them. We know better today and should act responsibly with the species we have left over or today's elephants will be tomorrow's mammoths.










  
Did you read the article? Easter Island was a lush place with palm trees and rich bio diversity once, as seed samples proof. Only after people started to cut down more trees then could naturally regrow, the place started to deteriorate and population declined harshly, never to rise back up to its former numbers (according to the classical archeological theory) . The Easter Islands were a tree less island, with little diversity and starving inhabitants when the first Westerners arrived there, describing the place. Is that the kind of place you want to "adapt" to or the rich forest covered island it had been before things got out of hand?

Another issue that comes with POS is the initial distribution problem that is even harsher then with the POW approach where the money supply get more evenly distributed over a longer period of time among miners, whereas with POS initial shareholders get to keep all the money supply for themselves and it depends on their benevolence/commitment to distribute the coins evenly. A very inefficient system if large and even distribution is the aim.

Its bad news for the whole industry. The heat Gox stood to take for years now is on the younger exchanges which will have a hard time and probably falter one way or another an then nothing remains, onlylf legal localbitcoins or secondmarket for accredited investors that doesnt even sell BTC but mere IOUs of BTC.

there is no such pattern in general, it only applies (with exemptions) to things which are obviously male or female like "der Mann", "die Frau", "der Penis", "die Stute" (the mare),..  
Inanimate objects more often then not have a gender to them. Dont ask me why, it just happened to be this way.

I take your point of BTC just being a technology without a mind of its own, so its up to the people to use it for one end or another. However a lot of people see it as the tool of choice to challenge the powers that be in order to create a better economic order in this world. It is true for them as they believe it but it puzzles me that they rush to those POS coins without questioning the underlying mechanism to enrichen the rich and supress the poor.

Private markets value government bonds of governments that can actually pay interest on their bonds and are not going to default anytime soon. By buying those bonds from governments (via the second market which in turn buys more from the governments) the ECB extends money to those governments indirectly. Governemtns are saved for a bit and bonds stay valuable.

The new money will find its way into wider circulation eventually, by means of credit extended to borrowers for example (about 10$ to borrowers from 1$ the bank received through QE --&gt; money creation from thin air by private banks). What you have described is the reason why we have not seen run away inflation in other western economies with QE style money printing, like Japan or the US, the fresh money is going from central banks directly into financial products and doesnt hit wider circulation that would raise prices for common joe. Stocks are in a constant rally becauseof this but eventually the bubble will burst and massive inflation ensue.

Yep, thats a problem. There are ways to 99.9999% secure your wallet, but they are pretty hard to execute and impractical on a day-to-day basis. I would rather make 1 or 2 saving wallets and keep a small amount in a hot wallet. The critical part with paper wallets is to generate the private keys on a 100% clean system. I would therefore use a Live CD. It sais in the description to never save the keys on a hard drive, but I guess you can do that if you encrypt them somewhere else prior to saving them on a hard drive.

actually provide value or grow the market.  
  
You dont cut speculators out of the loop. What you have in mind are *middle men*.  
Also, speculators provide liquidity to the market and thus shrink the spread from ASK and BID price. Thats some value if you ask me. Otherwise the market depth in MtGox would look more like these little exchanges with huge spreads, because they lack mentioned liquidity.

To find the right business idea, ask yourself what business can take advantage of bitcoins inheritent features, like
* anonymity
* freeness as in free beer
* promptness
* independence of traditional financial networks
* ubiquity
* distributedness
* ...
Then ask yourself what service could be based on those features that can do better with bitcoin then anything that already exists. Then ask yourself why you a predestined to do it. Look around for similar ideas and attempts, has anybody done it yet, competition? If so, why would you be able to compete?
P.S.: Dont shift anymore of your assets to bitcoin pls! It will go up in long term for sure but remains highly volatile in the mid term and can drag you into a liquidity crisis if you aren't cautious. Split your assets to maintain a stable foundation for your future ventures, 180k USD in BTC will equal 180M! USD once BTC increases 100 fold (well possible within the next 10 years imo). You dont need to take a greater risk exposure, unless you feel you couldnt possibly live off 180 million Dollars in 10 years from now.

To buy now seems like the save bet. Prices will go up in the mid to long term (i.e. from 1-2 weeks from now till a couple years in the future). MOnday marks a special day for bitcoin price in the short term, when a notorious user named Pirateat40 is due to deliver on his promise to pay back lenders of a large scale operation (which kind of business he was running for nearly a year still lies in the shadows). If he delivers and lenders receive back their BTC, then price will go down short term, if he fails to keeo his promise, price will rise.

Maybe he was quite smart at five?
Anyway, unfortunately some clients (if not all of them) force you to attach that fee in order for your transaction to be processed, because in the end it is up to the miners to accept transactions or not. If one tx pays better then another this tx is more likely to be processed by some miner. The spam argument seems invalid to me, because if there are no fees attached, there is no incentive for miners to process it, the tx therefore cannot spam the network because it is never processed in the first place.

If you bought those coins up during a down trend it would be possible to not change the price at all or even have a lower price after 1M$ are converted into BTC. That would of course constitute a strong downtrend or a lenghty time interval.
How long till those coins are back int circulation?
Hard to tell, depends on what the hacker plans to do with that 1M $. He would probably try to hide his tracks and launder those coins over some days or even weeks before he would move a substantial part of it.

You mean: He has 10k USD in BTC and wants to buy 10k*$10 worth of virt. goods to double spend the money on himself, thus receiving the goods AND the money.  
  
For that scenario to happen, the attacker would need to find ~10k different sellers that he can trade with within a 10 minutes timeframe (time it takes for 1 confirmation on average). Near to impossible.

Maybe add a link to weusecoins.com or that bitcoin can be stored at home in encrypted files, paper wallets or even brain wallets and are therefore theft resistant.

An issue that seems to shimer through here alot is that you plan to change the habits of your customers (e.g. using bitcoin instead of fiat/credit card, no fiat currency quotes,..) instead of adapting to those habits to make the use experience as convenient and useful as possible. A fully BTC based concept may be the best of all possibilities the only problem is: Your average customer doesnt know that! You can lead the horses to water but cant make them drink.  
I study marketing and can tell you users will turn away because they dont want to change their habits. Only if they WANT to use bitcoin they will accept it, not if they HAVE TO. What you have in mind works for Silk Road, because it offers such a huge utility users would not have without using Bitcoin. Honestly you dont offer that added value. Its just an online bookstore (with all due respect;). Instead of going through the hassle of dealing with Bitcoin your clients would probably pay 5$ more on amazon to get that book. Pls reconsider other payment/quote-options and suttle BTC usage incentives.

From some [post]( on bitcointalk.com, a reply from currency-iso.org:    
  














Yes, I did read those "reasons" but I dont think they are justified.  
1. Well, too bad. This will never happen. Bitcoins are not issued or controlled by any country whatsoever and will therefore not have any links to that country. Gold (XAU), Silver (XAG) and to some extent the Euro (EUR) dont either.  
2. Is Gold a private currency? Bitcoin is accepted tender all around the world. So this argument hinges.  
3. ??? What, no international payments? Those people obviously dont understand what bitcoin is or how it works.  
4. Does not apply either (there is no Institution that is responsible for *the* Bitcoin, not even *the* Bitcoin Foundation). Since when do two companies decide what counts as an international currency and what does not? I get the point that a wider use will boost recognition but it should not be dependent on reuters and bloomberg alone.

The exchange rate doesnt really matter. Bitcoin as a payment system works at 0.1$/BTC today as well as at 100$/BTC tomorrow. To have stable prices (I mean same value over time), they could simply peg their prices to the USD, Gold or any other comodity and adjust the prices for games and services accordingly. In our day and age no problem.  
As long as they dont hold significant amounts of BTC themselves, they are unaffected by volatile exchange rates and have a working payment system for their products in place.

"bossless hierachy" sounds like fertile ground for bitcoin. Maybe they are indeed forward thinking enough to consider using bitcoin (it would obviously be perfect for trading across platforms and formats). The common mind set across the industry however seems to be:  
1. Create own proprietary currency  
2. Get people to use it  
3. ???  
4. Profit  
  
What benefits, if any, actually hide behind the question marks and whether the same coulndt also be achieve using some readily available open source alternative stays long unanswered or unprocrastinated. So long till the "managing" costs of that proprietary currency that failed to have the anticipated success grow without gain.

I was thinking about it (just now!):  
Suppose you go to Argentina with a lot of bitcoins, how do you convert the Pesos back to Bitcoin in the most efficient way?  
- you could send a wire transfer to MtGox from some local bank account (if you have one or use a friend/proxy), but that probably takes for ever and costs alot.  
- you could try to find a cheap Ecurrency exchanger that takes your Pesos on location (Buenos Aires, Montevideo if you have to) and trades them in for any of the [accepted]( Ecurrencies that you can then send to MtGox via AurumXchange at once for no (or low) fees  
- what else?

The only case I can think of is that some user would want to get around your 10$-restriction. If they do so: Its their own fault if they get defrauded for not adhearing the most basic security procedures (wait for some confirmations!).

No, *you don't get it*. Read my above posts, the site could never execute an order larger then 10000 BTC on a 1:1000 leveraged account (resulting in 10M tradable volume!!) because thats more then all bitcoins in existance! Even 130 BTC in a 1:1000 account would require the broker to buy MORE BTC THEN AVAILABLE on MtGox right now.

Maybe I still dont get you. Bitcoin is a push only payment system. In contrast to the push and pull system banks have in place with user induced wires and direct withdrawals (ACH in USA). No one can authorise a withdrawal from any bitcoin address, other then the user himself, in possession of the private key that goes with that address. Your concerns (if I guessed correctly here) that someone could just withdraw 10k x 10$ from anyone's account is unfounded. Only the user himself can initiate those transactions.

nope. The arbitrage opportunity arises from the difference in the official and black market exchange rate.  
  
Example (rates according to article):  
1BTC=11.70 USD  
1USD=6.20 ARS (black market rate)  
1USD=4.70 ARS (official rate)
  
--&gt; 1BTC=11.70USD*6.20ARS=72.54ARS (black market rate)  
You sell 100 BTC for black market rate (~25% above official rate) in Argentina for ARS. That equals 7254 ARS. You now convert them back to BTC by wiring those 7254 ARS to some MtGox account (or using E-currencies for that matter), at MtGox rates (1BTC=11.70USD) all additional costs, like wire transfer charges and exchange losses aside, that equals **131.91 BTC**. You just made 31.91 BTC or 31.91% ROI.  
The calculation:  
100BTC * 11.70=1170USD * **6.20**=7254ARS  
@_date: 2012-12-20 22:56:22
But is that really what happens? Cant only the Bitcoins owned by the cut off clients be spent, thus stay unaffected by the other blockchain?
(which means: After a split we have two reservoirs of coins, both never mix but stay fully functional. After a reunification the transactions in the small blockchain are nullified I think, not sure though.)
@_date: 2012-07-19 11:15:02
Wait for it to get down to 8.4$, then rebuy. If it breaks below 8.00$, find a good opportunity to sell, rebuy at 7.60$. If we break below 7.50$, dont buy and wait for a new bottom to form (probably somewhere in the 5.XX area). This rally has 12-14$ potential after all, maybe more, but aggressive pumping strategies by the major players may cut it short prematurely.

What comes to my mind:  
  
- For most txs 0-confirmations are perfectly fine, because the overhead it takes to pull off some double spending attack for small amounts (like 100$ or so) outweights the cost to pull it off by far. So you are practically save to do smaller txs because noone will attempt to scam you out of some dollars when they would have to pay thousands to do it. If you dont wait for any confirmations, every tx is distributed across the network in seconds (try sending some BTC to yourself for example).  
  
- Litecoin only requires 2.5 min on average to verify a tx, while Bitcoin takes 10 min. But again, for smaller amounts 0 confirmations are perfectly fine.

There is just so much confusion going on with unproven accusations and excuses from all participants of bitcoinica, which are also closely related to intersango. Bitcoinicas original founder and later employee Zhou Tong has been accused of hacking its former enterprise at least once, although unproven many hints point towards this direction (he himself accuses a former business partner to have commited the fraud). Also the incompetency of Intersango owners and runners to process customer claims and security issues was repeatedly exposed in at least 3 hacks after they acquired bitcoinica from Zhou. 
Add to that the obscured legal liabilities and connections to bitcoinica and its primary investor (Wendon Group) and you get the idea, why intersango has been fallen out of customers favour lately. If you want to put your money there think it over again. They have to proove that they can run a business like this, before they can be trusted again.

I dont think it would work, because wat Silk Road did was to completely anonymize buyer and seller. Drugs are sent in the mail. With sex related stuff, both customers still have to be physically present, unless you refer to things that can already by found and consumed over the internet. So if both parties are engaged in something illegal in their jurisdiction, then there is no improvement for them and hence no reason to use a Silky Road kind of thing.

How is that supposed to work? Maybe I could give access to my history by means of a colored coin i hand out to a doctor of my chosing, maybe even with an expiration attached to that coin. With that colored coin he then could "buy" access to my medical history but once he has it, he may as well make as many copies of it as he sees fit. He may also trade his colored coin for something else (money), so then some stranger has that coin and can gain access to my medical history. Doesnt sound too convincing or have I missed something?

This looks like a cool game, you only need to fill in the real estate aka Bitcoin companies like MtGox (after 10 rounds it completely vanishes and you have to put all your money through a whole in the playing field you cut out where it was before) or BitInstant (after 10 rounds you go to jail) or the 4 drug market places around the board where you multiply the fees by the number of drugs markets you already own (Silk Road, Silk Road 2.0, Silk Road Reloaded, Sheep Marketplace). Also good tokens for players would be a fat cat (her name is Tibanne), a fat cat CEO (his name is Mark), a Bitcoin, a Japanese guy, a Pirate (age: 40), a SuperNintendo (name: Lawsky), a trezor and a conjoined Twin (since one twin without the other is not obvious enough).

When it becomes apparent that the first ASICs came on, some speculators will try to sell first, before the mined coins hit the market. That may cause the price to drop further. I expect the effect on price caused by the sell off of mined coins to at least double in size, due to that.

They need to improve their assumptions if they want to provide a realistic estimation on the actiual costs of an 51% attack.    
- They currently assume that all miners would voluntarily rent out their hashing power to a malicious party, as I understand it. Thats unrealistic because a: hashing power of most miners is not for sale and b: as soon as it would become apparent what the hashing power is put to use for, most miners would just quit their contract and keep mining in the "right" fork to preserve the network and with it, their own savings value (Bitcoins)  
- To launch a 51% attack the attacking entity would have to buy their own mining gear for above mentioned reasons, so they would either have to acquire it from a currently successfully delivering company, by coercion or deception or start to manufacture their own, those costs need to be calculated  
- Additional hashing power from GPUs, FPGAs and idle ASICs would probably be untied in an event of a 51% attack to preserve the correct fork.  
- Earnings during the 51% attack could be deducted from total costs (although value would plunge)  
- Costs could be drastically reduced if the main 2 or three mining pools would be attacked and subsequently taken down in pursuit of hashing superiority. If I was to attack the network, I would hit it where it is the most vulnerable.

Basically everyone that finds a block can pull off a 51% attack for as long as he finds a block. As long as he finds blocks to add to HIS blockchain stack which has to be the longest one. So technically with only 1 block mined YOU could pull off such an attack but probably only for 1 block because you wont find the next one unless you come close to 50% of network speed. Makes kind of sense?

Just hold on to your BTCs a single year or more and they are tax free (dont you know?

You can prove that they are yours (private key), when you put them there and that they havent moved, e.g. changed ownership (blockchain). Done.

Its easy: Just start out with a few hints that make it impossible to solve the riddle. Then reveal more hints as time passes. That way the insane initial difficulty is lowered and it becomes more likely that someone will come up with the solution.  
Also choose a riddle almost everybody on earth can relate to (so no Bon Jovi lyrics or old Buddhist scrolls) or give hints that actually connect via those out of the ordinary pieces of knowledge, that way no one can solve the riddle on their own and everybody on earth has equal chances to recognice some of the hints but not the others, so collaboration is required.

@ nagdude: I think its a nice idea and we need those impulses to continously evaluate and develop the concept of our currency.  
What strikes me most true is that Bitcoin as a currency needs more interlaces with physical commodities in order to provide a stable exchange rate and improve on its overall chances of survival.  
What I cannot agree with however is the need for a purposeful backing because of Bitcoin's percieved fittness to survive as a currency on its own (like gold and to some extent the dollar). With such a measure would come dependance on the backing authority, the backing commodity (Gold et al) and a lack of decentralization as well as an attack vector for governments. All in all such a measure seems unnecessary and would maybe bring a short timed boost for trust and adoption but create problems for many decades in the future (see central backing, dependancies, etc.).

Why would they charge higher fees? They could very well charge no fees at all to BTC-businesses and instead take flat fees to cover their operating costs or loan out their deposits on the open market. If its a bank set up for BTC-businesses there is no point in not offering the most favorable conditions to them. They could even reward the businesses for higher deposits.

Because it would decrease the usefulness of Bitcoin as a currency.   
E.g.: I have a shop that sells eggs. Apart from accepting Dollars and Euros I now also want to accept Bitcoins. In order to correctly price my products I have to pay attention not only to convert to the correct prices for ONE digital currency, but to price, collect, manage and account for 10+ currencies (colored coins of MtGox, Bitstamp, Coinabul, SatoshiDice, Joe Doe,..) with different, constantly changing values each.  
If one Bitcoin is worth less then another Bitcoin practicality for daily use is drastically reduced because users may never be sure WHAT the actually hold in their wallets and whether or not they have been provided with worthless Bitcoins that are blacklisted on some merchants shitlist for example because those coins are from a competitor or have been recently stolen from them.

I guess they will make Zerocoin an optional gimmick of the Protocol. Not Bitcoin will adept itself to Zerocoin but rather the other way around. People that want to stay anonymous will have the oportunity to use Zerocoin like they have today with TOR. People who dont care or dont dare because of legal scrutiny or whatever will just use the stanard client with no additional features I guess. Also adding Zericoin to the protocol by default would make it harder to stand a fight against authorities.

They feed on berries while on land without ice, although it is questionable whether this kind of diet would be sustainable for them all year round:  
  
Some areas reduce hospitality for polar bears, others increase with rising temperatures:   
  
Global Polar bear population has actually risen over the past 50 years:   
  
Add to that the close kinship to Brown Bears (that live outside the arctics), an expected increase of biologic production and diversity of newly ice free zones with higher temperatures and the ability of Polar Bears to adept their ways according to change of conditions. Their numbers may shrink but their extinction is unlikely.

Speculators fulfill a couple of functions:  
- they find prices for things, otherwise nobody would know what Bitcoins are worth atm.   
- they provide liquidity for what they trade so you can always buy or sell what you like in large quantities   
with that comes that they close the "spread", the so called difference between buying price and selling price so people dont suffer big losses from that difference   
- they draw attention to Bitcoin when the price goes up, hate it or love it but without the past 2 bubbles only a fraaction of people that know about Bitcoin now would know about it without speculation (including myself)

I also use a yubikey almost since the beginning and I think this is what kept me save in addition to their cold storage wallets.

@_date: 2013-04-19 21:30:11
Correct, but assume you have got 60% of network speed for a couple of hours, then YOUR blockstack outgrows the legitimate other 40% of the network aboout 20% each hour, making your blockstack longer and thus staying in power, because even if the other miners find a block for the legitimate stack, it would be disregarded by Bitcoin clients all over the network, because only the longest stack in existence is regarded "legitimate". All blocks of shorter stacks remain disregarded until the stack they belong to becomes the longest one.  
In order to maintain the longest stack 51% of the network hash rate are required to always stay ahead of competing stacks.

I think it works like this: there is a public servant sitting somewhere in the British citizen registry. He offers his services on SR and has the authority to create new identities by a click on his keyboard. The freshly minted documents are then sent to the buyer on SR. He/She goes to a local supermarket with the ID+a prepaid anonymous debit card and buys something above a certain threshold. The cashier is required to verify ID if articles above that threshold (lets say 200 Pound) are purchased so she scans the ID number in her till where they are sent to some statal registry. The input and entry match so the payment goes through. The same mechanic is used for all such check ups, social welfare or voting included. Better check those infos, because I just heard from a third source and never actually tried it myself.

Although, there is [Exante](
@_date: 2013-06-29 15:23:49
It does. What you were suggesting in your earlier post is that you have your Bitcoins taxed when they are worth, lets say 5 USD. In order to do this you have to convert them to USD. If bought them for a cheaper price earlier on, lets say for 4 USD a piece, you can have your gains taxed. Only problem is that you have no more BTCs! So to profit from a rise in value, you have to change your USDs back to BTCs again, so you buy them at lets say 5 USD and wait till they are worth 50 USD a piece. To profit from it you have to change them back to USD, thus need to have them taxed again and so forth.  
Thats why I said, there are no BTCs to gamble with for any amount of time after you have taxes on them, you always have to pay again after you generated some gains with them (i.e. convert them to USD).

Much more destructable would be if they mined all 2016 blocks in super time and then just dropped out of the game leaving the difficulty after its first adjustment in astronomical hights, crippling the Bitcoin network, because it would take very very long to create another block (2016 times the amount of time it took to mine the former 2016 blocks). One block could easily take days or weeks to generate in that scenario, leaving the network useless until a mayor update, maybe fork would be issued and adopted by a mayority of users. yeah, but highlly unlikely anyway..;)

Why shouldnt the board members have their own arguments?  
I dont see how this is evitable. Even in most democratic systems different organs of the system can get into conflict with one another, even sue each other, like the government sues the congress over legal concerns or similar. In that case the highest courts have to speak justice so the two parties can lay their quarrel to rest. Same thing here.  
I also dont see how Peter would have misused/abused his power as board member against the other one or even payed bad service to the Foundations goals (to promote, protect and standardize the Bitcoin project).

btc-e.com is always trading around 10-15% lower then MtGOx.   
I think its because there is few possibility to get any fiat in if you have no Russian or Ukrainian bank account. Just have a look at their deposit methods! On the other hand getting BTC in is no problem, thus less demand with equal supply like at MtGox means higher price.

You cant measure the size of the Bitcoin economy by this instrument. What it shows you is the sheer TRANSACTION VOLUME of the Bitcoin network. Ever heard of Bot trading or Bitcoin mixing services? Those applications push Bitcoins back and forth a thousand times a day and hardly contribute to the economy. I could bloat this graph by myself. All I need is 10 BTC on MtGox and a Bidding Bot or a mixing application and I could easily make thousands if not hundreds of thousands of transactions that make this measure go up like crazy. All it proves, really, is that there is more transaction volume now then 6 month ago. No mention of its origin though.

You dont have such  great target on your back as someone who is known to have a sizeable balance in his wallet (social engineering), but you should not get lazy with you security, especially if those 100$ are rather precious for you. Always use 2-factor authentification for online wallets (oncl. exchanges) and never leave your BTC in there longer then you need to, because if you leave them in there long enough, they will eventually b stolen.

If you want to buy something from the spot, just give a new order that matches the price someone already created. Say the best ASK is at 50k XRP, just click on "New Order" and enter any number under "Buy BTC" for 50k XRP per BTC (&gt;&gt;&gt; "Price each"). Excecute and voila! You just bought yourself 1 BTC.

All of my points assume rational actors that thrive to maximize their profits. The attempt to protect the blockchain against forks comes down to preserving the value of BTC against the USD. If such attack would be successful all BTC earnings and equipment of miners would sharply dive over night

        To Easterners, a Yankee is a New Englander.
        To New Englanders, a Yankee is a Vermonter.
        And in Vermont, a Yankee is somebody who eats pie for breakfast.

Not your BTCs are taxed but your GAINS. So there are no "tax free" Bitcoins to gamble till infinity with after u payed taxed on them once! Every time you get acquire new gains with them u have declare tax on em!Sry dude.  
My strategy btw is to wait for a decent amount before I declare my gains (lets say 1M $ in gains befrore I declare them, otherwise I would loose out BIG time if I declared tax on every little gain).
