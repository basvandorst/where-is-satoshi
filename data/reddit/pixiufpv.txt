haha ok, yeah, the "yo guys..." thing is a bit rough. and i guess i just forgot that people actually do read posts on here and blindly follow the advice given ��

it's like, damn, i might not have any legs and i look like a goon with my beady eyeballs, but i'll be damned if some petty shit storm like this takes me. gotta swim to shore and get hooked up with that titanium alloy. it's what they use on the space shuttle, in case you didn't know...

i almost did the same thing last weekend! i refer to my earnings as my "puppy fund". now it's kind of become my "get a bigger apartment so my future puppy will be happier fund".

i'm confused at why this post doesn't make sense to you. it's someone telling people not to panic about the dip in btc that was happening. i'm not a btc veteran by any means, but not totally new to the game either. i still get that panic feeling when things like this happen and tonight i came here and saw this post. it was reassuring to read through and have a laugh at some of the comments. there's a lot of people with less knowledge than me and more invested, i'm sure some of them saw this and got the message OP was trying to get across.

segweet is new. it's going to be better than beetcoin and ethereem. probably worth looking in to if you wanna get rich. 1 segweet = 1 lambo

i didn't bother to run this all the way through, or code it efficiently for that matter, for several reasons, but i'm pretty sure it'll go through every combination of the words.
pretty much just stacked 24 for-loops on top of each other and said fuck it

"monero is a privacy focused cryptocurrency with very strong engineering"
"isn't that the one used by criminals"

i'm in no position to make suggestions about where someone should put their money, but personally, i agree with this statement. with the exception of btc, monero is the main coin i truly believe in. i pretty much view 99% of cryptocurrencies as a way to earn more btc, i have very little personal interest in their purpose. there's too many to keep track of these days. but monero and btc are the two i hold, regardless.
that probably didn't answer any of your questions, but sometimes the monero fanboy in me just comes out like that. my overall advice would be that if you're 24, have enough cash to live comfortably for a minute; do whatever makes you happiest for right now. you seem to have your shit together and if crypto is what you're passionate about just go for it on a more personal level while you can. who knows where we'll be in a year, or even a month from now. being naive and making naive choices is part of life. sometimes they work out and sometimes they don't. as long as you're able to look back and learn from the mistakes it's usually worth it, in my opinion. /end "grown-up" ramble

this is what concerns me most. all the drama/"scandal"/negative attention will turn off a lot of people who might have been on the edge of getting in. and the negative attention always makes headlines, so even the smallest thing becomes huge and invokes fear

i live in detroit and a few days ago i was talking with a friend who isn't in to cryptocurrency at all and he asked how bitcoin was doing. i was surprised, but i just gave him a quick update on things ie. it went down, then it came back up etc... he said he saw a bitcoin atm at a gas station in the city and this seemed to be what he needed to validate the whole thing for him. like, before seeing this it wasn't real or something, which is how i think a lot of people feel. now he's been reading about blockchain and just general digital currency stuff and kind of taking it more seriously. maybe stupid videos like this are a good thing, it just gets a simple message out there; you can buy bitcoin and get your cash out whenever you want. that might be all that some people need to get in.

when he explained how money to americans is like water to a fish i had a moment. definitely worth listening to
edit- i think he actually said something like the *idea* of money....
