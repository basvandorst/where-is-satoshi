I live in Korea and send money to the USA about once a month. I save 30 bucks everytime and don't have to go to the bank before work and hope they know English. I can write something up if you want more info.

I always try to sell my btc when i see it dropping like this. Then buy more than i sold when it gets to a stable trough. Always enjoy the ride!

Where do my coworkers send money? We all send money back to the USA. I would love to get into business marketing BTC remittance to ESL teachers. There are so many of us. So many not taking advantage of btc. Probably a huge market to tap into.

I live in Korea, can confirm how convinent buying coin is. I try to get my coworkers to stop spending 35 dollars to send money home. They are afraid of btc. I am not sure how to convince them, maybe this will help.

Ah I understand, while you are still abroad. Circle doesn't work for you? I transfer there when I am ready to cash out. Fees add up but still loads cheaper than bank remittance.

There is no local coin selling or app?

About 0.00287357 btc fee for a $1000 buy. Oh and the markup is about 2 dollars per coin for the exchange here in Korea I use.

Probably as easy and profitable as the sites that offer you free usd.
