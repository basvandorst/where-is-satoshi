Thats a great question. I wonder if there is anyone at the moment.

This is a link to the article in Fintech Daily:

Africoin would be backed bitcoin, but it would be based on a monetary union of African countries....its truly a long shot, but ZImbabwe does have the ability to get creative with their currency now...only problem is Mugabe...

Its interesting to think of what they can do here, I just wonder what they will actually do. Why not make a basket consisting of a bunch of different currencies including digital, as a trial run.

And so the war on cash begins with its first casualties: Swiss pension funds and large depositors at banks worldwide are beginning to feel the impact of negative interest rates, which have the potential to unravel the global economy.

Are you asking why Zimbabwe isn't using bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:22:01
Nice work guys!!

In a system with fractional reserve banking(FRB) many of these problems go away. If Switzerland gets rid of FRB they can take the lead in many technologies. Banks were never supposed to have this kind of power.

What should bitcoin companies be doing to make bitcoin a viable option in these countries? Or will it not be viable at all as some have posed?

Does anyone think crypto has a big deflationary problem? Especially bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-08 12:31:05
Yes it does and thats the point of it. In times of massive recession or no growth its a form of monetary stimulus, savers get punished and are forced to go out the risk spectrum looking for yields. It also helps business out by allowing them to issue debt very cheap.

I think one major use case bitcoin needs to crack: how do you get bitcoin into the hands of the poor. There is way too much friction. Being poor already puts capital controls on you first and foremost, in fact being poor is a tax. Noone will take hyperinflated toilet paper, so what's the work around?
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:37:49
Not to mention real inflation is kept out of the headline numbers. Inflation based the S&amp;P is nowhere near record highs, not to mention wages havent risen in quite some time.

I don''t think those services will be accepting hryvnya or any currencies like it. Blockchain is BTC to BTC, and coinbase I'm sure will never touch the 3rd world. I could be wrong but thats what I think.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:49:49
I didnt read your article until now.  But the thoughts are any countries that have persistently high inflation rates, mainly developing world is where bitcoin should be focusing. There are problems with this though. The rich have offshore accounts hard assets they can trade for bitcoin etc, while poor and others have their  local currencies which noone wants. SO there is friction there for them in that when capital controls are in place they need to exchange a third party as noone wants that shit currency.  The other problem is technological in many of these countries.  The store of value part is only half the problem and a problem indeed. The bigger issue is how do you get bitcoin in the hands of these people and educate them.

The Chinese have tried this too.  You know all those ghost cities. :) I tend to agree with BittBurgers comments here: 
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:38:30
Exactly presuming they can get there hands on them(USD and Euro) which is a big problem particularly when capital controls come into place, and there is always the threat of theft with physical money, private keys make bitcoin a real option, if by safe you mean less volatile, I agree and thats big problem from a store of value perspective.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:39:02
An option only for high net worth individuals, not the poor who are stuck with toilet paper fiat.
@_date: 2015-03-02 14:37:04
Not sure if thats sarcasm...but there are definite similarities and thats undeniable.

The founder the Kuna Bitcoin Agency and The Bitcoin Embassy of Ukraine, Michael Chobanian.. I have told him to come in here and discuss. Hopefully he signs up and responds, I sent him the link.

Of course after this was published the dollar strengthened and bitcoin broke through the trendline. However if USD backs off $300 is possible, but once it gets there I think it heads much lower.
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:40:45
Agree 100%. In fact USD is accepted everywhere and u dont need a tech infrastructure for it, problem is scarcity when governments instill capital controls, hyperinflationary events, start seizing bank accounts etc...
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:34:41
I think the main friction point is hyrvnia to btc.  Particularly when you have hyperinflation like now.  Noone wants hryvnia so those who have need to convert it into something else to get bitcoin. Double taxation plus capital controls. The poor get stuck holding the bag.
Other than that your point is spot on and thats why when I wrote the article I certainly think crypto has a future in countries with persistently high inflation rates, but there are still barriers to entry.

What are people's opinions on Professor Kimballs views of paper money vs electronic money and the Zero Limit Band on paper money. He also talks about how bitcoin can have a negative interest rate.
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:04:10
What do you think will happen with Tether?
@_date: 2015-03-11 13:23:41
The problem with the USD move is similar to what happened in Oil, the fast paced parabolic nature of it, when things collapse so fast or rise so fast no one is prepared for the velocity of the move, hence the ramifications of this massive move in USD are still unknown but we see what all other countries and central banks are starting to do. China is the big problem though.
@_date: 2015-03-02 00:41:14
No my question is based on a demand issue with a limited supply.  If price doesnt rise exponentially higher, thats a big problem for bitcoin, and there isnt demand and as more and more merchants accept it the trajectory isn't going in the right direction.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:00:47
The USD is the most important chart in the world right now
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:50:10
By the way its a really good article!
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:18:34
I think there are obvious reasons why bitcoin is a huge solution to hyperinflation.
