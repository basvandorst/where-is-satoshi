It doesn't actually need segwit. It needs a malleability fix and segwit is not the only way to do that. I don't see bitcoin cash implementing segwit at this point.

Why bother splitting them if you are going to keep enough pieces together to access the coins? I thought the whole point was to ensure that anyone who accesses one location doesn't have access to the full key.

I think they meant support it as in 'allow it on their platform', which is nothing to do with pushing one coin over another.

Or the price would have gone even lower because people who wanted to sell would have been able to instead of getting their transactions stuck.

But it's not a gift, it's a mistake. Where I live legally you have too send the money back. Although I doubt any authorities would get involved for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:58:12
No, even when the bank can't reverse the transfer the person you sent it to legally has to return the money or you could start proceedings against them to get it returned.

Had a quick look at this and although it is obviously decentralised in the way that it is not hosted on a central server, there is still a site owner who has full control over content so there is still a single point of failure for any site. Seems like a neat idea though so I'll keep an eye on it
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:45:11
With a bank transfer (which this is much more like) they definitely do. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:52
But surely bitcoin cash would need to have 8x as much usage to approach the levels of congestion bitcoin is currently experiencing? So they will have the same issues (but only if/when it reaches that level of adoption).

Do you know why Luke's site has a number 5x lower than here? 
10% of nodes and 30% of miners seems like quite a lot of interest. And it might be even higher if people trusted the BU developers more.
@_date: 2017-03-26 08:06:55
Yes you are correct, I was wrong in my terminology. Thanks for the correction.
I think everyone is assuming what will happen if there is a split but in reality any split will be messy and the outcome will be uncertain. Therefore I would be surprised if core merge this given that they've been preaching the importance of safety above all else for months/years now.
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:07:08
Why are you bothering to link to your own rant which contains no proof as if it proves the point you're making?

I'm not sure how I was supposed to any other meaning from that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:26:04
So you're not gonna respond to the quote from the whitepaper I posted?
@_date: 2016-03-19 21:46:26
Did you actually read the article? I get how bitcoin could easily be described as a "system of record" but other than that nothing in the article seems remotely related to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:18:27
It doesn't mean they support it either though, they may not know anything about it.
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:09:12
Still don't have a response then? I posted a quote showing why I think the way I do and you refuse to acknowledge it because it shows you're wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:40:01


Isn't this exactly what was saying? Satoshi was saying that nodes work on extending the valid chain. Today we call those nodes miners. Most nodes today do not work on extending any blocks so they can't be the same as what Satoshi was talking about in that paragraph.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:32:23
Yes but you ignored the part I quoted because it shows you are wrong.
I agree that a node currently does exactly what you are saying, I don't agree that Satoshi always meant that when he said 'node' in the whitepaper because the part I quoted above shows that he didn't (or that he saw nodes &amp; miners as so intertwined that he didn't bother to distinguish).
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:43:36
Isn't the routing problem an incredibly difficult one though? Or is there now a known solution which just needs to be implemented?
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:12:34
But BIP9 segwit requires a majority of miners to activate it, this doesn't, so there is a MUCH higher chance of this causing a chain split (where old nodes would be on the side of the miners). You can argue that the miners will give in for economic reasons but that is not certain so I fail to see how this is not an incredibly risky approach.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:43:26
Can you explain how it doesn't lead to a hard fork if a majority of miners don't signal segwit (either by running BU/Classic or an older version of core)? In that case the majority of miners would be mining blocks which are valid to old nodes but not UASF nodes (which will reject non signaling blocks). Therefore hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:03:33
The user I was replying to specifically said bitcoin was not cash. That was all I was replying to. There's really no need to be so defensive.
@_date: 2017-03-11 20:59:57
I'm guessing they think they can make enough money from customers in New York to cover the $70,000. What other reason could there be?
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:41:02
But do you think many big players will run it if not fully endorsed by core? I think a lot of them like core for the stability &amp; track record of the developers involved. Therefore it seems likely that many of them will not run an additional patch which is only supported by a few devs.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:55:11
Some people are bound to buy them though so it seems unlikely it will be as clear cut as you are saying. I agree that the majority would likely follow the segwit chain but that doesn't mean it's risk free.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:42:07
You keep saying that but every time you try to explain what I'm wrong about you seem to completely ignore what I'm saying.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:52:19
Have you got a link? Cause I've never seen any such warnings and I read this sub quite a lot.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:13:29
But old nodes can't see the transactions in an extension block so wouldn't it be better to just fork them off? They're barely part of the network if there are transactions going on that they don't even know about.
The post from Theymos yesterday made extension blocks sounds absolutely horrendous from a user experience point of view.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:45:32
Depends if you have a better proposal than the extension block shit which was on here yesterday? Because that seems like a usability nightmare.
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:25:06
I think because Segwit makes the lightning network easier and that is touted as the way to bring micro transactions to bitcoin (without them all being on the blockchain).
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:01:24


Hahahaha okay I understand now.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:37:41
I understand very well but that is not the 'work' described. The work described is the same as the 'work' in 'Proof of Work', which non-mining nodes do not do.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:31:01


Is there really any need for this kind of thing?
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:34:00
And I responded to your quotes of the whitepaper. You won't respond to mine because you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:33:01
But people used to mine using core (back in CPU mining days) so the miner and the node were interlinked. That is no longer the case.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:06:57


This seems like quite a down side from a usability perspective. Would you mind explaining why it would be preferable to a hard fork to increase the block size? Are you completely opposed to any hard fork ever?
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:11:20
I thought it was peer to peer electronic cash. Or have you not read the whitepaper yet?
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:27:57
You are intellectually dishonest if you are trying to argue that's what that paragraph means. I'm not even gonna bother any more.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:01:22
Which is why I didn't just call them an asshole. Given they haven't bothered to correct it I doubt it though.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:19:57
All interesting points thanks. Whatever happens I think bitcoin is in for an interesting year!
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:16:46
Can you link me to that? Or does it have another name I can search? The extension block proposal I have seen was completely unworkable imo and not what you are describing.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:22:28
I still don't understand what I have said that you disagree with. Does your node


? If not then it presumably is different than the nodes Satoshi is describing in that paragraph.
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:36:16
If the majority of miners were running BU (but still at 1M, or even a pre-segwit version of core) they will be mining blocks which are valid to old nodes but not UASF nodes, resulting in a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:17:32
I've never used them but I think they still deserve a voice in this.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:17:29
No, the UASF nodes are going to orphan non-segwit blocks, presumably resulting in a split if most miners don't want to go along with them (because non-segwit blocks will be valid to older nodes so if the non-segwit chain has more work they will follow that one).
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:47:22
What makes you think that is not a hard fork though? You would be rejecting blocks which were previously valid.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:48:32
Do you have a link to an article/paper explaining the solution? Last I heard there was no known solution and people were arguing over whether one was technically possible.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:40:33
Stupid but looks like it didn't last long. Weren't you unbanned before you even made this thread? Looks that way from the mod logs.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:19:01
















I know what a node does. I have run a node. A non-mining node does not do what is described above, therefore clearly when Satoshi says 'node', he sometimes means what we would consider a 'miner' and not a non-mining node.
EDIT: Formatting.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:02:25
Isn't it a lot to gamble when it's not certain though? I've been hearing for a long time how dangerous BU is but this seems at least as dangerous. Although we know that a lot of people's stated position is to prefer the core chain that could definitely change at very short notice.
Also I feel like if there are significantly more miners on the Unlimited chain then they could tank the price of the core chain by attacking it. I doubt it's in their best interest to do so but they might not see it that.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:07:03
Thanks, I'll have a read!
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:11:21
Thanks for a reasonable post, they're getting pretty rare around here lately.
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:10:47
They have every right to release a plan though, just apparently no desire to do so.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:50:51
It's disingenuous to pretend that's the same thing though - not everyone will have even read the release notes, let alone bothered to read the full details of what Segwit actually is. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:59:44
Can you quote the part of the whitepaper which explains this? Because you seem to be totally ignoring the part you are quoting.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:25:01
I think core have the most competent developers but if this gets merged then I will absolutely run a competing implementation. This is essentially a Sybil attack which seems likely to result in a hard fork. I hope no one who has been preaching safety above all will be behind this.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:18:57
That all seems to be research, not any genuine proposals people are trying to gain any consensus for. Wouldn't you say that is different?
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:53:34
Or Core would be the altcoin given that they'd be the ones changing the PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:32:52
It got removed from this sub because they didn't agree to always follow the core chain.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:23:39
I've seen the threads I think you're talking about suggesting that solo mining is a dead end but I originally thought you meant threads telling existing miners (currently making a profit) to slow down/stop their investment. I think the 2 are very different and I've seen no examples of the second type.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:19:43
Fascinating point you have there.

Then they shouldn't have entrusted it with so much money. Anyone pouring money into that thing and believing it to be 100% secure before it was properly tested has a fundamental misunderstanding of how code works.

@_date: 2017-08-25 08:56:58
It's a result of how segwit works, not something additional tacked on - segwit separates the witness data and doesn't include that in the txid. This is why it is fixed only for segwit transactions.
@_date: 2016-06-04 19:02:42
@_date: 2017-08-27 13:46:05
But regardless of discount won't you have to use segwit transactions for lightning? Because the malleability fix only works for segwit transactions.

@_date: 2017-05-21 09:23:08
But presumably they still don't have the coins to pay everyone back the same about of coins they had (or they could have done that years ago) - the value of bitcoin increasing just means that their fewer coins now add up to the same fiat value. This means they could pay people back in fiat but not in bitcoin. And really it seems unlikely they could sell 200000 coins all at once for $2000 each.

But miners not running a UASF client will still build on a block not signalling segwit if it is valid to them. With current numbers the UASF will not work because the longer chain, which will include blocks not signalling segwit, will be valid to a majority of miners and nodes. If the exchanges do not explicitly support the UASF chain before August 1 then the UASF is fucked.
