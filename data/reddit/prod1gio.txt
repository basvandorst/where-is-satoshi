Yes, it was, even for me as i said.. You just a need a little less hate/ego in your speech. "Reasoned thought" is something, and "Overthink" is another, or they are the same word too? I just tried to show that "Bitcoins" is not ugly as OP was saying..And of course your answer was a nice one.. Have a good day.

Don't overthink too much, just grammar as it means to be. In many languages "S" is added to show that you are talking about plurals, more than just a single-one.

Nice to know..where i'm from (Brasil) "S" is by all means, in any plural word and sounds super fine even in Bitcoin.. And i said many, not every language ok? You know that the world is bigger than this "english empire" Dont wanna to sound arrogant bro, just said to not overthink and that's what you did. Thanks for the knowledge..

Miners gone? Have you ever asked yourself about renewable energy?..True cryptoanarchist and Og Whales tends to use low energy costs to mine.. Dont think that whole world are USA or EU that cost 0.3$Kw/h and there are many places on earth that energy can be easily smuggled from "EnergyCorps"...
