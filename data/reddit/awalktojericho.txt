The guy had no permit.  He knew this going in to it.  That put him at an unfair advantage over the hot dog vendors with at permit- they had to pay for one, follow ordinances about locations, etc.  He probably does not pay taxes, either.  So what was unjust?

Economics isn't called "the Dismal Science" for nothing.  It's the only test you take in college where the questions stay the same, but the answers change every year.

This whole crypto vs. hard cash battle is useless.  There is absolutely no way there is enough hard cash to replace all the "value" in the US, much less the world.  That's one reason why banks fail.  The whole economic system is set up on "Mental Money" created when you lend and charge interest, etc.  So fiat is still crypto, even if it doesn't want to be.
