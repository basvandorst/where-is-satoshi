in [coinb.in]( how do I use a segwit redeem script to properly create a raw transaction there?

Lulz it's a few dollars beneath 600.00 it's WAY up, have a party. Remember when we went bats hit insane when it broke the 450 "psychological limit"? Well we did it. Market correction was sure to put a stop to that raise, but we still did it. Party it up, withdraw a bit of your bitcoin, have a beautiful time. :) 
And if you were unfortunate enough to buy bitcoin whilst it was in the middle of its big rise, which is already a questionable move financially, might i suggest you hang onto your coins until the lightning network gets implemented before you make any hasty decisions, but ultimately it's your coin. Do what thou wilt.

Good Job Flips, I has wracking my brain to find out what the purpose of the verticle and horizontal lines were. I'm not quick enough for these puzzles, but I sure am having fun. Good job and thanks for the explanation. :)

I do, I only allow traffic into ports 8333 and 80 though, using router and ipfw rules on free bsd.
Opening ports is not inherently unsafe. If your computer has no process listening to those ports it will do nothing. What you have to worry about is software that does listen to those ports. Either explicitly run by you or in the background. 
I occasionally run packet sniffing programs on my computer and have found processes in the background I installed but was unaware at the volume of communication it sent. Those I would consider security risks - for bitcoin I occasionally peek into the packets and from what I can tell nothing fishy is going on.
I for one trust the bitcoin community to make a safe and secure program I can run without opening security back doors or having a disastrous security flaw. 
If security is your main concern though and you're running a server that doesn't need to communicate to your home network, I'd suggest you make it a dmz server. That way if for whatever reason the server were to be 'compromised' your home network will be completely safeguarded by the router.
I'm by no means a network security 'expert' but I believe I've garnished enough experience to answer whatever questions you may have or at least point you in the right direction. 
If you'd still like to setup a full node and have any questions please don't hesitate to pm me and I'll try my best to set you up.

I am merely pointing out, answering a legitimate question like this when someone is on the fence of BU implementation of scaling makes you look like a *condescending ass* all the while **convincing them away from your stance**. Open discourse is a gift in this community, and answering questions with insults squelches that. If you are unable to answer the man's question, I request that you politely keep your snide comments to yourself.
Now, it is my understanding that BU isn't just about *larger* blocks, but giving miners *power over the block size*. Essentially a larger amount of control over the system that isn't completely understood could perhaps be beneficial or even benign because of "market forces" or perhaps have miners hold people's bitcoin and the ability to transact hostage by manipulating the block size. To be completely honest, I am not the most qualified person to talk about this, but Seg Wit, although complex in nature, affects the behavior of the system the least, it affects how transactions are saved on the block chain. Whereas BU affects a fundamental principle of bitcoin, it grants *control* or *manipulation* as to how everyone else can experience bitcoin.
It is also my understanding that after numerous bugs and security holes were found in BU they no longer have the source code available for review. There are many reasons I cannot support a bitcoin client I cannot review and compile myself.
Again I am by no means an *expert* in this field, and a lot of my information has come from word of mouth, so if I am wrong in any of my assertions please let the community point it out so I don't spread misinformation or FUD.

As has said - the listen flag as well as the port forwarding enables "incoming" connections. "out going" connections are generally allowed by default in devices. The 8 connections you see are still connections, but connection your process initiated.
Now say my node wishes to connect to your server to dl part of the block chain. If you are not listening for messages my connection will be ignored and I'll never receive the "TCP handshake" before a connection resulting in a rejection. 
No matter how many packets I send to you, they will not result intentional code being executed on my part because that data simply is ignored and deleted.
By listening you allowing all incoming connections, unless explicitly blacklisted, increasing the number of connections you support - also increasing your upload bandwith. As link suggests if your ISP has datacaps imposed there are ways of limiting bandwith: 
I have been running a full node accepting incoming connections for a few years now, and I have never, to my knowledge, been hit with a security breach. So I would encourage you to listen for incoming connections.
If you do end up listening for incoming connections and you are wondering if outsiders can connect to your full node, put your external ip address in the search bar here: 
It will tell you if your node is reachable or not.
-Hope I helped

I think you'll be surprised to learn that if the rate of growth in population stays the current 1.1% we have today, [there would not be enough molecules in the universe to support that many humans]( in less than 10,000 years - realistically **much shorter** than that. Also I don't think your logic is sound - I do not see how it follows that adoption is increasing because population is increasing. It is quite possible to have demand shrink or stay the same with an ever increasing population. Not that I am arguing against the adoption of bitcoin, only that your comment makes little sense to me.

I remember when it was a new thing, I was still in College... so not terribly long ago.
@_date: 2015-09-01 11:12:11
That is a very interesting line of code... why is it a good idea to restrict who you connect to based on their port? This doesn't seem necessary nor does it seem to have any benifits. Only when the program halfway fails the inner loop will it attempt to connect with clients not using the "default port".... why??
@_date: 2015-09-01 10:59:28
Uhhh, you know you can just use a different port.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:59:21
Ahh, that answers my question. I wasn't thinking about the validity of the network, also I wasn't aware of sybil attacks until just now. Thank you for enlightening me.

I played poker with some friends. Me being eccentric, offered to pay with bitcoin. It was par for the course that I offered at every corner and every time someone refused. Not this time - somebody accepted. I set up an account for them and paid them to buy in. Fast forward 3 years bitcoin is worth $20K. I go out drinking with said friend. He loses his mind over how much forgotten bitcoin he has and doesn't even remember I was the one who gave it to him. At the end of the night he pays for all of my drinks. Worth it.

I wish I could tell you how I beat the system. It sounds to me that you're just very unlucky. :(
Usually I only pay .5 of the standard fees as calculated by online calculators, and my transactions confirm in 2 blocks. The only thing I do is run my own full nodes 24/7 and broadcast my transactions that way. I'm actually surprised at how fast they confirm because usually I'm aggregating 5-8 inputs into 1 input. Maybe I'm just lucky?
Try running your own full node server - maybe that will help?
I think if you send me your signed transaction in text form, I could broadcast it from my nodes using rpc commands. I dunno though, I never tried doing it that way before, but I think it's worth a shot. Who knows, if I get this working, I might be able to sell a service of faster confirmations by taking a little tip myself, if nothing else, at least it will give me an excuse to play around with my nodes. :)

True, but after the RFPOW ends you'll still have addresses like
 
Which does in fact make bitcoin into a deflationary currency.

You're right, absolutely correct. You CAN prove a negative with a [Proof of Impossibility]( or [Evidence of Absence]( but in the case of CSW being SN, there is no evidence of absence.
Also your evidence of absence for unicorns is in fact wrong. Yes, you have to PROVE your [Premisses]( or else you could be working under a false premise in which case your conclusion is invalid. Not only do you assume unicorn fossils will be on record, you assume they'd leave behind any fossil evidence at all when in fact new evidence shows some species actually do NOT leave behind any form of fossil: [Fossils](
BTW, "mister I proved pink elephants don't exist", here's what albino elephants look like: [Pink Elephants!](
They look plenty pink to me, the logic you are using is invalid. Just because you did not prove a negative does not imply a positive. That my friend is NOT how [Modus Ponens]( works. Just because I can't prove God doesn't exist doesn't mean he does....  This neither proves the positive nor the negative. It might make you uncomfortable, but that's the way it is.
Just because we cannot PROVE CSW isn't SN doesn't mean he is. I just see no evidence of absence. I am not implying there isn't some out there, but your argument still leaves me unconvinced until I see the evidence.

Hey I'm a newbie... and I don't want to.be robbed - so you think you can sell me your bitcoins for 500?

Can you please explain number 1? I'm not familiar with this. Also what does number 2 even mean? Why is 170% of the blocksize an obstacle?
Please excuse my ignorance but I'm curious. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:50:40
Exactly, This. It's not how much you transact - it's how large the transaction is in the network. There are ways of keeping the size of your transaction small by consolidating your inputs.
