Explanation to this panic rumor, there is BANK holiday for one week so BANKS will close for one week, wow, what an surprise!
Here you have schedule of CN holidays in English:
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:08:57
yeah because Gox, law or PR firm would for sure write in official document "they deserve to bankrupt" that's very common in any official document for your client
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:39:53
what's not trustworthy about Slovenia? the country is in European Union, Eurozone and it's already richer than Greece, Portugal and other "reliable" countries
would some old lady travel to Germany or Singapore or what has location of exchange to do with anything except that US is extremely hypocritical country?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:28:44
it's blank page, not down, it returns even HTTPS certificate
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:41:46
depends on your defense mechanism and cache
@_date: 2014-03-27 05:08:23
what's wrong with PDF download anyway? what are you using IE5 that you are so afraid?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:00:00
can you please read what i asked about - where should I move my **litecoins**? bitpay is bitcoin processor and not wallet/exchange service especially not for litecoins
and I wanna have coins at hand in exchange, it's not so significant amount to worry too much
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:03:36
yes, but maybe if you are reading r/Bitcoin you should know how to open PDF safely without being afraid...
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:58:14
as I said below in this thread "and I wanna have coins at hand in exchange, it's not so significant amount to worry too much" although i would prefer reliable non-anonymous exchange
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:25:58
nah, I thought you are going to do something better with your winchester, but I guess you are not in japan :)
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:44:34
you don't need to have money there to be affected anywhere in any exchange
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:27:33
I feel sorry for people cleaning street/apartment where they will find him.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:59:10
because I trade them doh...
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:23:49
so now investors are massochist and wanna lose money intentionally by making these documents?
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:41:22
so where should I move my litecoins? because apparently I ain't keeping them in Chinese exchange and no major exchange accept them...
but I see where you are coming from, it would be easier for me to travel around EU or China and find some guy to get money out of him (one or the other way) than from some anonymous dude hiding on internet
I just hope people you don't want to mess with will set up example for other exchanges, because I am sure they were laundering money through Karpeles exchange and they should show other owners on example of Karpeles what happen when you run with their money away.
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:01:22
photos/videos or it didn't happened...
btw. it would be pretty dumb move from Mt. Gox guys, I guess they would not appreciate their own lives then
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:57:11
nothing to see actually, just description of market and options how to save gox, but nothing about bitcoin or other exchanges (except words of praise for btc-e and one other exchange, forgot name) or how they stolen people's money, don't waste your time
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:39:57
plenty of ways how to open safely PDF, VM is one of the options, you can as well use just properly set up PDF reader with limited rights
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:37:43
what has this selfpromo to do with BTC-e, or you are just trying to abuse this thread for advertisement ?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:02:34
and how does it answer my question where to move my **litecoins** ?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:00:03
as I said below in this thread "and I wanna have coins at hand in exchange, it's not so significant amount to worry too much" although i would prefer reliable non-anonymous exchange
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:41:55
I think you are very optimistic and it seems this guy doesn't value his life much if he thinks he can get away with this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:46:15
well it didn't helped much, but at least there is always something their clients can do to set example for other exchanges how to (not) behave and think twice about stealing client's money
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:57:39
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:25:24
no they didn't, mt.gox volume was joke for long time...
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:36:59
bad luck then for them, since i use LibreOffice on windows as well
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:56:43
well i opened zip, inside is regular doc file which is empty, so quite fail on my Android phone
i thought it's more likely to to harvest information but they would be useless some btce is not operating, so not sure what's the point of this email, it didn't contain any virus or executable
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:57:33
it's just password protected zip with empty doc inside, no executables, maybe macros? no success on my Android phone
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:32:53
which most of the chinese can't anyway since they don't have foreign bank accounts, so he is correct
I am just curious what will happen if they would allow deposits again in China or how they will allow it, if they can launch some fast card deposits or wire transfer accounts for ach bank then the price should go up but I am not optimist.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:41:22
One more reason to live - don't let Chinese commies to take your life away, Chinese are not worth it! :)
yes, if you lost big money you know where to direct your anger, hint: it's not bitcoin itself...
so instead of killing yourself or some innocent civilians in Chinatown, think about doing something positive for Chinese folks, you can become part of their history :)
EDIT: for downvoting ignorants, I was talking about chinese gov, not about regular Chinese folks who obviously can't introduce regulations for bitcoin related business
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:52:02
nothing new, these warnings were posted even on OKcoin, there are always SMS/call frauds in China, people sending you messages like "hi friend, the bank account we talked is 12345... to send money" and like this, so nothing special that these people try it with bitcoin as well
@_date: 2013-12-17 07:55:20
i think nobody has verified information on this
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:14:48
how? post the original chinese text because I don't see there anything like this, although I've found bigger version of the picture here:
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:23:45
he is just lying new post is more than 24 hours old and doesn't say anything about that, just saying deposit temporary unavailable and withdrawals fine
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:20:42
1. it's Friday morning 8:18 in China and deposits on OKCoin still don't work
2. transfer money out of China is not really problem at all for Chinese citizens, everything can be done in internet banking, no need to go even to branch at all, I've done it few times (not being Chinese citizen but using wife's account), never really tried to receive money but I don't see how that should be problem, in worst case just send ATM card by courier and use ATM (this can be done both ways since Chinese Unionpay it's basically available everywhere in world)
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:07:43
yes, no problem
register at okcoin.com (no big deal even with google translate) and go to this page:
there you will see icons of banks which you want to use, choose your chinese bank, choose amount you want to fund and you will be redirected to paygate of Yeepay and directly to your bank page
until today you could choose pay by bank card (instant funding) or through Tenpay, today after changes they removed Tenpay and kept only bank card through processor Yeepay
only difference is that funding and withdrawing must go through your bank account now, but it's fast and works fine
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:59:16
who cares, they jsut posted 2 weeks old news we all read two weeks ago, maybe next year in January they will post again news related to 3rd party processors we are interested today
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:29:00
i don't think there is difference between them, difference is their interpretation of regulations which don't have immediate effect as I understood
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:54:57
the official statement of OKCoin is here (but you are right, what you posted if copypaste from there, I will ask my wife to translate it although it doesn't seem very interesting):
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:47:41
yeah, some people say it's 50K USD per year, I see 50K USD per day in internet banking of Bank of China, not that even 50K USD per year would not be more than enough for 99% people in China
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:11:26
The link you posted doesn't work for me, it shows me system is busy.
EDIT: there is no such thing posted on webpage of Huobi, first check by yourself then rate some post on Reddit, this guy is just trying to sell his coins higher
I would be the first one happy to announce deposits work again and everything go back to normal and growing
@_date: 2013-12-17 12:29:35
yeah sure, for common good of chinese people, especially those running exchanges :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:45:45
it always depends at what level you jumped the train, of course if you jumped at 150 you don't care until it will reach 100 etc.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:09:33
there is not single way to deposit money to OKCoin, there were to options before:
1. Tenpay
2. Bank card instant payment (but redirected through Tenpay to your bank website)
until Wednesday there was one left
0. Bank card instant payment (redirected to your bank website through Yeepay, literally for less than 1 second, without any action required ony our side)
Thursday morning:
0. There is NO WAY to deposit money into OKCoin.
If you don't trust me then just register at OKCoin and check funding page (they call it recharge in URL address).
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:06:35
well it's not rally good since there is less and less options how to fund/withdraw money in China, so let's hope it won't affect bank card payments and wire transfers
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:13:16
he was right yesterday, both btcchina and okcoin were operating fine and news about 3rd party processors were really fake, today the news are different 3rd party processors and any deposits are not available anymore, so what's your point? or his yesterday news will be valid forever, whenever you read them? my wife lost half of the money already (not listening my advices :)) but it's not big deal, just few hundreds dollars, just saying so other won't blame me I am trying to manipulate anyone to anything
1. nobody knows where is the bottom when china will leave the market
2. nobody knows if deposits in china will start working again and bitcoin can go up (I'm pesimist about it)
in the end I have no advice for people who have coins now, I sold (for wife) at half price (LTC, not BTC) and now waiting for opportunity to buy cheap and hopefully double it at least later to get back loss
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:05:55
I dunno when they need to stop business, maybe before spring festival, so this would only mean that Alipay and Tenpay play it safe to shut it down immediately, while Yeepay will keep going until last minute trying to earn as much as possible. But the thing is there is NO REAL announcement regarding this, everything is still just rumors.
And suddenly both biggest Chinese exchanges BTCChina and OKcoin today introduced 0.3% transaction fee which is conincidence since today was such heavy day on their business, someone made few millions today just on fees.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:17:54
+1 exactly this
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:14:27
what proof? register at okcoin and see for yourself if you don't believe normal users or what you wanna see my bank card on video how i am funding my account, are you for real?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:25:33
actually if you check internet banking of BoC it says in English 50K USD per day, so dunno if it's chinglish in BoC English ibanking or you are wrong, although quality of translation of BoC ibanking seem good
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:26:52
this website is not reliable at all, I live in China and some websites shown working are not really working and opposite, it really matters on your ISP, even two people with two different ISP in beijing can have different results
anyway proxy/VPN in China is matter of 3-4RMB per month for the cheapest one, if you wanna fancy one pay 8-10RMB per month, and if you are noob you can always buy from those overpriced international companies for 10x more
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:14:19
that just doesn't make sense, because more and more chiense will do arbitrage until the difference will be so small it won't be worthy, right now 590 vs 631 makes 7% profit minus fees, so already not really worthy, bitcoin was always most of the time more expensive in China, 7% is not worth mentioning
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:31:22
it's same on okcoin right now, no way to deposit money at all
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:16:54
why would Chinese buy gold...
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:57:15
this is 2 weeks old news not related at all to what happened in last 24 hours, not a word about 3rd party processors
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:13:01
I think only rumors for now.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:00:59
not possible to verify, here is the NEWEST post more than 24 hours ago not saying anything like liar in OP:
EDIT: please stop bullshiting people, the newest post on official weibo channel of BTCChina is from yesterday more than 24 hours ago December 18th, just saying about temporary shutdown of deposit, but withdrawal still going on, please people don't trust this guy, there is nothing like this posted, you can check on your own with link
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:18:06
there are plenty of payment processors in China, Alipay and Tenpay are the most famous, here you have other famous:
apparently I was ignorant not knowing anything else except those two
EDIT: Lakala is quite huge, they have kiosks all around Beijing supermarkets where i am paying for electricity/gas (since these are PREpaid services in China with card and digital electricity/gasmeters)
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:14:12
there is no such message on frontpage of huobi, so thank you for fake news
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:28:13
that thread was corret yesterday, yesterday everything worked fine, deposits stopped today, one day difference is a lot in world of bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:44:21
exactly, as we say in my language: money (always) were, money are and money will be (somewhere somehow available)
no point killing yourself over money
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:17:36
hahaha, FXBTC, you mean site stealing money right now where people wait already like 1-2 days to get BTC out of their system? yeah I would trust that small shady exchange for sure... better stick with Huobi, OKCoin and BTCChina
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:31:31
crap, I am so angry about this, I am doing business on OKcoin.com, had set up orders for 143RMB and 133RMB and when litecoin finally after few days again tanked down to 130RMB of course my orders were not processed and even when trying to buy for 170RMB whole market was lagging so no way to buy cheap panic sold litecoins, crap... for next time must set up higher price for order and hopefully it will be processed
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:10:05
OK, so wife read it to me and see OP
the truth is BTCChina switched from Alipay to Yeepay and truth is OKCoin switched from Tenpay to Yeepay, but on explanation why they did this anywhere
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:53:59
I can tell you about OKCoin (didn't used BTCChina since April crash), if you chose to fund money into your OKCoin account by your bank card, you chose your bank, it opened new window, for second (literally less than second) you saw some redirect page of Tenpay/Yeepay and then you was immediately taken to website of your bank for instant bank card payment. This worked until Wednesday morning (local time), when my colleague was still able to fund money into FXBTC, but before lunch when I tried to fund money I found deposits are halted.
What happened yesterday is that you end up on middle step at Yeepay with error note, today Friday morning, you won't get on OKCoin even there and you will just stay on the funding page of OKCoin.
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:38:08
well I don't have any problems using their system, much faster than BTCChina and support LTC too, although I experienced one time glitch when I set up order to buy and I got nothing bought even when the price in charts as lower, but who knows...
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:08:52
yes, before there were to options to fund money on OKcoin:
1. tenpay (semi-anonymous, but not really anyway)
2. bank card through tenpay which will redirect you to your bank page (this is instant funding, immediately as you confirm transation money will apear in your okcoin account, unlike waiting 20mins at BTCchina using Alipay before)
today after changes:
1. bank card through yeepay processor which is just redirect to your bank website
although I must mention that Alipay is standard in China for payments like Paypal in US, while Tenpay is developed by Tencent (owner of WeChat, QQ - biggest IM network in world), maybe 2nd biggest CN IT company, although I've never heard about Yeepay until today
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:03:56
no, deposits in China still don't work, look at volume, these is pushed by small players, I expect fall if there won't be good news about eposit very soon, it's already 3rd day without deposits today, but who knows what will happen today, to me it looks like panic buys
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:20:20
I know Neusoft as small localization company, the biggest IT company in China is probably Alibaba group running Taobao/TMall/Aliexpress/Alipay with second being Tencent (Wechat, QQ, Tenpay) and somewhere around would be Baidu.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:48:08
I dunno, but I was frequently checking OKcoin yesterday whole day and funding didn't work all day since morning (Chinese local time)
funding RMB into your account doesn't work even on Thursday morning now 7:47AM Beijing time, only change compared to yesterday is, that yesterday you end up with error note on yeepay, today you won't get even there and will just stay on funding page of okcoin
I would not say the price plummeted down, price went down all the way to 2000-2100RMB and right now is 2600RMB, that's 25% higher with no real reason since there is no way to fund money into chinese exchange
At same time I am checking also BTCChina.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:10:37
please distinguish between chinese and chinese gov, which I was talking about
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:52:38
I don't need to rely on your fake news, I am regularly checking deposit options on OKCoin and I just checked it now around 1PM and the answer is clear - no deposits in China
huobi website tells me just this in english - "504 Gateway Time-out"
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:29:35
didn't try but check junk folder
at present moment is not possible to deposit funds to btcchina and okcoin at all
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:05:34
the link doesn't work so it's not possible to judge if it's fake news or real, to me it seems more like fake news, i don't see how one exchange could start deposits while BTCChina and OKCoin can't
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:51:04
that's just stupid, your life can be nice even without money it's just about attitude and at same time you can have nice income and feel shitty
btw. today in my company they fired suddenly around 25% of coworkers, so I can pretty relate how people losing money on bitcoin feel, but it's not end of the life, year for now it will be just past for my coworkers and for people who lost today money it will be maybe just bitter memory, just have to keep going
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:12:27
Alipay is standard/biggest, Tenpay (from Tencent) would be second I guess
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:23:10
because it's fake, there is no such post on Weibo of BTCChina and the post there is regarding different thing
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:33:54
almost any european country or southeasi asia has unionpay in ATM
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:20:07
we are not far from there, at present time 2250RMB in china which means 370USD, while bottom of gox was for now 480USD but it's coming very close right now at 487USD
@_date: 2013-12-17 10:25:52
no, this is not verified, 3rd party processors seem to be finished, but direct bank transfers through card or wire transfers are OK at least for now and there is no real news that this should change
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:16:17
no it doesn't, anyone can verify it by going to their homepage, there is nothing like this, even without Chinese you can search for "24" and see he is talking BS... you will find only message in the bottom of page talking about different things
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:51:53
well, you should come to China to see what is poverty, romania is stil rich counry in general compared to china, so think positive, you are in EU :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:23:02
there is no panic selling, price rose more than 50% from crash from 2000RMB to more than 3500RMB at present time, there are not reasonable panic buys
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:20:25
ehm, VCR, seriously? even in 2005? they know why they didn't chose at least 2010 data
plus these were real physical products from very beginning useful to people, can you say same about BTC?
