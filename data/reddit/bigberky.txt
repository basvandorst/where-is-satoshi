IMHO they're insolvent and they're allowing trades to continue so they can make money off the percentage you pay with each trade
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:30:26
What can the people do to push this bill? Anything?
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:31:53
looks like just tens of thousands of "investments"
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:56:28
Also a possible truth. Just boasting high numbers to try and build trust
@_date: 2013-02-04 21:00:26
Are you in the US?
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:30:32
There's a few options in practice. One could be using bit floors same day cash deposit - I'll buy you coins at a price you say and send you the coins. I would recommend smaller batches of money so 1: you aren't giving a massive sum of money to a person you don't know and 2: you keep the fees down.
 Another could be writing a check or something similar to me and I can buy through mtgox. Slower process though that way as I usually process through dwolla. I could wire to mtgox but its sometimes a pain

Just added a post about tipping in btc as well
@_date: 2013-02-05 23:55:33
On it's way. Sorry about that delay
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:57:52
1%...what we're all shooting for :)
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:55:49
Or if you're worried about cameras you have someone else go in and say it's you and grab the pizza.

We're going live tonight on BBC radio. Me and Riley are thinking about talking about this BS on CNBC. Comment ( and give us your thoughts. We go live in three hours!
@_date: 2013-02-04 23:48:39
that'd be awesome! haha
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:16:46

Forgot to post this. Money sent over to Ryan.
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:41:21
Just started sending over $72. Will post screenshot when it hits my paypal
@_date: 2013-02-07 00:39:19
I'm glad everything went smoothly! Thank you for your business :)
@_date: 2013-02-27 20:50:00
Yes I'm doing just that. For people who want to donate in btc I've set up a wallet for donations. I've received 1btc so far which I'll be sending over later today through PayPal.
EDIT: I've just received another 1btc which totals 2btc in donations which I'll be starting to send to Ryan
@_date: 2013-02-21 03:22:38
We were working on a batch pricing update last night but it stopped half way through. I just manually updated all the pricing. We're working on the batch though so everything will be much faster
@_date: 2013-02-04 21:28:56
What's an address near you? I'll check it out
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:19:34
pizzaforcoins.com * :)
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:47:18
Of course! Giftsforcoins.com has ecards for your shopping needs and if you get hungry there's always pizzaforcoins.com ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:01:37
And we're back in the spotlight :). It's been some months with crazy swings but it seems business is picking back up. Man I love this currency and community 
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:12:12
You can use it for carry out as well :). Currently Pizza Hut doesn't allow some stores to use gift cards for carry out so just email us before so we can verify before you place your order!
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:57:17
Our first order was Feb 4th and we're at order number 53. Some days maybe 5 and some none. It's hard to predict haha
@_date: 2013-02-27 06:32:42
I'm not sure how much more he needs and if it's an ongoing thing but since no one has started a bitcoin address for his life saving treatment I'll do it.
I'll be exchanging coins out every day on MtGox, pushing them to my bank account and then moving them to paypal and sending them over to him. It's sort of a process but I can't think of an easier way to do it right now.
@_date: 2013-02-12 10:31:42
To make it even more anonymous you could place an order for pick up and use a false name. Use a one-time-use email address for your confirmation and an address near the location you want to pick up from. Now you're solid :)
@_date: 2013-02-11 21:57:14
Ohhh that was the random order we got for the 2 liter this afternoon haha. I wish I had checked the pages before I processed that order. Now there's a Diet Coke paid for at the pico store hahaha. Let me see if I can reverse that.
Thank you for the honesty though!
@_date: 2013-02-05 09:43:31
pizzaforcoins.com lol
@_date: 2013-02-21 03:27:48
Youzabaussss. Pizzabauss haha
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:57:46
Sounds good to me!
@_date: 2013-02-05 03:14:30
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:06:01
These are definitely things we're looking into. We have a guy finishing up some code for us now that should help automate pricing a lot more than now. We'll keep in touch :)
@_date: 2013-02-15 03:32:44
That is a nice feature except we don't exchange the coins to cash. We try to keep hold of the coins and put them back into circulation.
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:22:33
Haha thanks so much. Just updated ;)
@_date: 2013-03-21 23:45:08
If you're still having trouble I can purchase the coins for you. I haven't had any issues....ever
@_date: 2013-02-13 02:55:19
You pick it up at the store
@_date: 2013-02-05 23:36:39
Just waiting on Dominos to send the ecard over. Been waiting on them for 28 minutes.
@_date: 2013-03-11 21:38:48
We're working on it now :)
@_date: 2013-02-20 21:45:12
Well we offer Dominos, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. What do you mean even if there is a pizza place so close to yours?
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:08:34
Nah that's fine. Short and sweet :)
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:55:47
The store number isn't the end of the world. It's only really important if you're ordering carry out so we know which store is your preferred choice if there's two nearby.
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:18:09
thanks very much! we do work really hard to make sure every customer is happy.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:45:16
haha you guys make the transactions so much easier!
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:17:05
Pizzaforcoins.com! 
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:23:21
Pizza Hut section is now LIVE!!!!
@_date: 2013-02-15 03:34:44
As in if we accept at the exchange rate and it plummets, we lose a lot of money while trying to provide a service to the community. No one who's intelligent in business would do that with a currency that is so volatile. We are doing our best though and as we get better at what we do, our cushion will be smaller and smaller til it's cheaper to use btc than usd/can/euro
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:11:12
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:05:40
You might want to take out the end of the link and just put pizzaforcoins.com and then cross out hut in "pizza hut"
@_date: 2013-02-20 09:57:36
On the pizza part, don't say dominos accepts bitcoin haha. But you can say bitcoin users are creating sites to enable users to purchase everyday things. Its dominos, pizza hut and papa johns btw :)
@_date: 2013-02-12 06:24:10
You're all good. Thanks for sending some back our way!
@_date: 2013-02-21 03:27:20
We cash out the coins we need to reimburse ourselves every other week or so and the coins we don't use we try to use coin-to-coin transactions. By enabling people to use coins for everyday items, the demand for the coins increases which therefore increases the price. That's the simplest way I can explain it without going into a massive story.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:16:35
Pizzaforcoins.com works in the states and Australia
@_date: 2013-02-07 00:35:01
That's just for our records. If you send an email through to us we can make it say pizzaforcoins sent you a pizza. We just need your info in case there is an issue :)
@_date: 2013-02-11 21:58:18
We are currently adding the tipping option right now. We're probably going to just add a $2 and $4 option so it makes it easier. That should be live this week.
@_date: 2013-02-05 01:50:03
currently it's only in the US and the only address that has been an issue was one right next to their corporate headquarters 
@_date: 2013-09-27 08:49:41
We have a new item on our other site that allows the purchase of the voucher so you can order whenever you want. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 06:35:40
If they open up a hash address on their official thread/post I'll be deleting this post and finish up sending any funds you all donate.
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:56:46
We don't resell any information, we like to keep as anonymous as we can as well when we do orders. We will not be the weakest link in this bitcoin community
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:04:03
thank you kindly :)
@_date: 2013-02-15 01:16:54
Try pricing it again. I just did a pretty big pricing update and lowered everything. The jump in exchange rate has been pretty crazy lately
@_date: 2013-02-11 23:06:03
OP knows what I'm talking about
@_date: 2013-02-27 06:40:09
I just set up a new address for donations. I am one of the creators of PizzaForCoins so my profile on that site is all public. I'm just trying to help any way I can.
