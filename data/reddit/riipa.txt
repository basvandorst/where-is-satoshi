Well, getting USD out of Mt.Gox seems to be a problem since mid 2013. While SEPA and Japanese money seems to work fine, they have a problem that their bank processes only few money wires per week. These wires are still done manually at the bank (which is also why they cost a fortune). 
The hive mind that is .decided to hate Mt. Gox and does ever since.

I could ask you to present this evidence, but since you are obviously not even able to read and understand, that I do not and did not have money with Gox, I highly doubt you will deliver anything worth my time. So... yeah, whatever.

No, they cannot do that. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:05:40
That is exactly the kind of FUD I talked about. Sheeples cry foul and scam and do not have _any_ evidence.
Again, I did not use them in the past and probably never will. And yes, they made mistakes. Big mistakes for everything I know. But I do not think they act malicious or try to scam anyone.
Btw: It is also real money that is at stake if Gox has to go out of business at some point because all the FUD made the customers move to other exchanges.

I would use "more objective" and "dispassionate" instead of "armchair expert, but what ever. More important: Since you sure live by you own rules and you seem to care and talk a lot about Gox, I assume you have money there, which would make you an idiot by your own ruling. Aaaaand I'm gone.

Lemmings indeed. Those Lemmings decided to hate Mt. Gox in 2013 and since then it is only hate and FUD about insolvency that is upvoted here.
- even though the rumors about insolvency are there for the better part of a year, there is not a single piece of evidence
- nearly a year ago some million Dollar have been seized from accounts that belong to Gox in some way. Since then they made substantially more from their operations. 
- Mt. Gox claims that the problems with FIAT payments are SWIFT related and there is no evidence that this is a lie.
- FIAT payments seem to have worked well or okay with SEPA and in Japan
- Gox had Roger Ver, formerly praised as Bitcoin Jesus, looking at their books and accounts to back up their claim about having the funds to pay and just being hindered by the banks.
- When they claimed transfer malleability to be a problem for more services everyone laughed and called them names. Even the highly praised new prince Mr.  Antonopolous did this cheap move. Turns out, that at least Bitcoin.de, e-BTC and the allmighty and utter flawless Bitstamp did have the same problem.
On a more personal note I think Mr. Karpeles ran out of shits to give about what everybody thinks. 
He did many good things for Bitcoin as a whole (Domains, Wiki, etc), he and Gox took one for the team more than just one time. All they get is zealots crying scam and cheap ad-hominems.
Full disclosure: I am in no way related to Mt.Gox or Mr.  Karpeles. I don’t have funds in Mt.Gox and did not use them in the past even though having an account there.

Typical thinking human that doesn't want leaks to be used to push an candidate/agenda. Also knowing the difference between a leak and a leak campaign that goes on for months.
@_date: 2016-11-01 12:39:18
Unfortunately not. Wikileaks playing a very shady roll lately.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:03:44
The shady part is, that Wikileaks is not agnostic to their content, they seem to push an agenda instead of being a neutral entity.
The leaks are very US centric in general (I am missing leaks from countries like Russia...) and lately they seem to be one sided in their political nature too.
Now speaking about the US elections it is of course a problem for WL if there are leaks available from one candidate and none from the other. Any leak will interfere with the election but it's still absolutely viable and necessary to release these leaks anyway. But here is the thing: Releasing this information bit by bit to keep the pressure up for months is shady. It may be done to keep interest in WL high and the donations coming, it may be done to push an agenda and both options are shady as fuck.
What the world needs is a leak platform is there for all countries and is agnostic to political positions and parties. I don't feel Wikileaks is this platform (anymore?).
P.S. I am neither a US citizen nor living in the US, the idea of "shilling" for any side in this election is quite ridiculous to me. I am neither a fan of Hillary nor a fan of Trump, just someone seeing WikiLeaks' course very critical.

I use the Andreas' wallet on my phone too and (first things first) it works just fine. It is open source and from what I understand it can and should be trusted. 
The client does not download the whole Blockchain as the original client for desktop computers but uses copies in the peer to peer network in order to prevent getting your mobile stuck with just this app.
The keys are stored within the user space of the app and can be exported for backup.

In other words, all the people talking from their asses are very annoying.
Let's get the facts on Mt. Gox straight:
-they didn't process (a relevant number of?) USD withdrawals for months.
- they seem to process (at least some?) EUR withdrawals
- they blame Japanese banks being unable to process many SWIFT wires
- they got a certain amount of money seized in the US, no one seems to know if that means $10 or $1.000.000 or maybe even more
- in the last 30 days 670k Bitcoin were bought/sold through their marketplace which is a market share of 56% of all tracked transactions and if I remember correctly should give them around 670k USD margin (14m Bitcoin sold/bough in 6 months)
- "some guy" that is well respected within the community went to check whats happening there and confirmed, that they have the money to process withdrawals
- they truly suck at communications and from what I hear they suck at customer service too. especially if the service involves communications 
Pretty much everything else is pure speculation. Speculation that could develop into a serious problem for Mt.Gox even if it's not true. So how about proving the FUD or shutting up?
And no, I am not a Fanboy. I have an account at Mt.Gox but did never use it. I don't have or had money there. I don't recommend Mt.Gox to anyone asking for an exchange. I just hate people going completely nuts on some FUD.

Yes, many people on Reddit seem to hate Mt.Gox nowadays, but what oGdarkness states is simply not true. a.) They are still the exchange with the highest revenues. b.) From all we know they are not bankrupt.

Well, as a German:
2013 Budget 302,0 Billion Euro
Biggest individual budgets:	
   •  Work/Social - 119,2 Billion Euro	
   •  debt repayment - 33,0 Billion Euro	
   •  defense - 33,3 Billion Euro
   •  transport/construction - 26,4 Mrd. Euro	
Our whole defense budget is around 10% of the spendings. A rough estimate is that we pay around 10% of this budget for actual operations.
I personally support most of the operations, as they are UN missions.
On the other hand we spend around 80% (another 10% for paying debts) for social purposes, education, transportation, funding research...
Government might be out of control in many countries (including Germany), but that does not justify stealing from your fellow people.

That is why there is such thing as freedom of contract (at least in Germany) for most parts of the law.
Most of the laws regulate what should happen by default (=if nothing else is agreed on) in an contract. And most of them can be overthrown by a mutually agreed contract.
There are actually quite few trade laws that enforce things upon agreeing parties. Most of these laws are purpose build to protect the weaker party in a deal (e.g. rentees) from unfair advantage.
And yes I strongly believe most of the people are so sociopathic that the only thing keeping us from initiating force against our neighbors constantly is law.

Even though I could definititely use some coins I don't think I would or could just keep it if I am under the impression that this happened by mistake. I would transfer them to a safe wallet (as the one in question may be compromised) and try to find out what happened.
Even if if someone sent 10k to 1riipah3bAsEefWuF2ZFYWjmL5Q7JGTNw which is on my homepage I would investigate if someone tried to send less and screwed the transaction. This is not 10 bucks you find on the streets.

This guy just can't be serious. I mean... come on, no one would say "Like every good American, I don’t like what I don’t understand and I definitely don’t understand what a bitcoin is." and MEAN it. Right?

For me it is the $75 mil that make Peter Vessenes / Coinlab terrible. Typical fantasy type value of a claim that can happen only in Murrica!
Did Mt. Gox screw over Coinlab? I don't know. Maybe they did, maybe they did not. Maybe they are a bunch of idiots that unintentionally screwed this, just like they screwed other things.
IF they screwed Coinlab one way or the other did it cause damages worth $75 mil? Never f***ing ever.

Any proof or just FUD?

(6:47:54 PM) MagicalTux: I could comment on the fact that our income since April is around 8 million USD
Not per month. Last 30 days 670k Bitcoin have been sold/bought through Mt.Gox. So it's roughly 670k USD per month. Last year they had operational cost of 36k USD per month and given the "roughly the same" quote it shouldn't be much more than 50k right now.

Major issues like crying foul and scam everytime something went wrong on any exchange? 
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:50:58
Absolutely, as I said, I just want to be sure not to miss something about it.

Well the Schildbach app has a good backup functionality. I didn't try Mycelium yet, but I would argue that creating a unencrypted(?!) PDF with the data, and expose it to the interwebz (at least to send it to a priner) is might be a great way to prevent you from forgetting a password, but it is not too safe.
@_date: 2013-08-11 17:54:41
Definitely both! :)

At the same time they _have_ processed (some?) SEPA wires and they seem to function as an exchange for EUR currency.
I really don't know if things are like they say, but the fact, that most problems occur with USD and Roger Ver had a look at their account statements makes everything else FUD until there is proof.
@_date: 2013-07-26 13:44:15
I'd be happy to see them removed too.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:59:04
Not to say Mycelium is bad, but all these points are true for Andreas' app too.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:55:09
Dude is looking for cheap BTC... 
@_date: 2013-06-27 21:01:35
Even though this was meant to be sarcastic: Yes. If you cannot charge enough to make a living from whatever you offer then there is no business in the first place and you should and WILL go bankrupt. And yes that does include your employees. If you cannot live from what your work and instead have to live on welfare than there is no reason to do such "job".
"But people will always look for the cheapest competitor and there is always someone paying less and leaving me behind". Yes, people being the greedy assholes they are is the exact reason why we need minimum wages.

You might want to add mtgoxEUR, mtgoxJPY, mtgoxAUD, mtgoxGBP, mtgoxCAD. -.-
mtgox	 616,383	 46.99 %
bitstamp	 330,967	 25.23 %
So, yes we know it, no more love for Mt. Gox. They are bad  and everything would be better if bitstamp would be the biggest exchange. Get a grip! Or grow up at least...
I remember erveryone crying tears of joy when Kraken was announced. Now everyone cries because they have not enough volume but refuses to use them and actively change this.

Sure, "super socialist". That's why so many people work for 7, 5 or even 3,50 Euro per hour and get supplementary benefits instead of being able to live on their wages.
In a "super socialist" country assholes, that build their business on slave wages, would be slugged instead being vowed for the so called job miracle.

Making an assault at the competition is always appreciated... not. Bonus cred for being wrong...
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:10:59
Also a mix of investment and money to spend here. Things I spent BTC on:
- membership dues for the political party I am in
- video games (HumbleBundle)
- couple pizzas (lieferservice.de ftw!)
- food and drinks at a local bar

Hmm, car, wife, camera... Wait, did you call my camera useless?!
A camera isn't useless, it marks the fine line between a frowned upon  peeper and a well respected artist.
