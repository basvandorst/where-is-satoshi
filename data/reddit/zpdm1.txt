I don't see any benefit to bitcoin from this.  If you want to short bitcoin go into cash while you think it will go down.  Futures and derivatives markets are generally there so fat cats can use leverage to manipulate markets.  With fiat, they often make bad guesses and bill the host nation for the losses, this won't work with blockchain.  There will possibly be a lot of criticism of BTC when idiots make leveraged bets in the futures market that go south and then try to blame (recoup?) bitcoin for their losses.  If you think bitcoin is going up in the future, buy some, if you think it is going down, stay in cash. what the hll does a "futures market" add?

Not a software guy, but does this mean all the Segwit2X miners are currently not making money until they upgrade/change their software?

I haven't tried replicating or anything but a financial guy crunched the numbers and said the, what, Pearson correlation coefficient, r squared, modeled 94% of bitcoins price variability over the past FOUR years based from two variables. 1) # of txs 2) square of number of users.  So barring an outside attack or mammoth programming screw up I don't see BTC retreating to 3,000 anytime soon.
