That was kind of the mistake. NO ONE CAN PREDICT THE MARKET. I promise you this. People who claim to be able to are scam artists.
You still have a nice chunk of change. Tell you what to do: put all of it into a few low cost index funds and about 10% of it into bond funds. Then let it sit for many years. That's it. That's the whole secret. You could argue your return wouldn't be better, which isn't true, but even assuming that was correct, your return now is terrible right?
The benefit here is you WILL profit over time with this method. Near 100% certainty. And you will never have to research a stock again. Good luck!
EDIT: if you don't believe me, and, like me, are prone to over-researching everything, don't take my word. Read as many classic investing books as you can. The advice they contain will almost always point to buying and holding low cost index funds.

I'm 27, but alright...
Also, is your argument that he should make the exact mistake that got him here? Great advice. Well done.
But hey, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you know something better than the "dumb shit" the guy who founded Vanguard advises.

This is my very favorite thing about the stock market. It rewards people who take the time to learn the system and are driven by long term thinking and simple math. Conversely, it destroys gamblers and greedy people, like this poor bastard, redirecting wealth towards those who deserve it. It is truly one of the most efficient systems humans have created.
