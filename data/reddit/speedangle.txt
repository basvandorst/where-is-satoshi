BTC, ETH, LTC, XMR.  No DASH.  DASH bad.

Thanks for the reply.  I would definitely be more inclined to eat there knowing I didn't have to wait for confirmations.  It's not like you can't see me pay and what the fee is.
  
You should do a contest where if someone pays at time of ordering and gets it into a block before you get the pizza to the table they get something. :)

You know the answer so fuck off.  Hard fork is not needed so we won't do it.  Core will not offer an inferior unsafe fork when it is not necessary.  If they did, they would be relentlessly attacked for giving into pressure from a well funded group.  It wouldn't be any different than giving into a government, we would all fry them.  So fuck off if you seriously don't want to admit this and move forward with a sound and tested solution that solves huge hurdles in scaling.  SegWit will allow LN, enable it and see what changes to the protocol need to happen and continue to do that as cautiously as possible.  This is a multi billion dollar experiment and peoples money is at stake.  Their hope for the future is at stake.

Sounds good to me.

What does my account age have to do with how many confirmations or how are you handling confirmations for pizza sales?

Why would we hand Ver and Wu their own Bitcoin chain on a golden platter?  That is what you are doing if you hard fork.

If we stop mining blocks, bitcoin is dead, no more transactions.

Your recent history is you stirring the pot on this subject so don't give me that garbage.  You know all the merits, you have rehashed this subject several times.  It's in your history bro.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:49:13
How many confirmations before I can take a bite?
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:33:15
There won't be any transactions after the final block is mined.

Ver doesn't want to waste money.  His paid shills are not as effective when the price is surging because they get drowned out by the excitement.  So they wait until it levels or falls and ramp it up so he gets the most bang for his buck.

I did fuck off that was hours ago.

You can buy cable interfaces that will plug your hard drive into your USB port on your current computer.  As long as they are the same OS and it isn't encrypted you should be able to browse the data.  Go look up where the default wallet locations are for your OS.

Stop throwing your money away and just buy bitcoin directly and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:14:29


  
We are way ahead of you.  We have collectively acknowledged it and built a software solution to solve it.  Check it out.  It is called SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:10:02
You should stop jumping to conclusions, I am a bitcoin permabull.
  
So like how are you handling the current fee situation?  You are very susceptible to double spend attacks if you aren't waiting for confirmations and confirmations can be tricky right now.  I'm just a curious bitcoin fanatic!
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:25:30
This sounds so sexy.

I don't mind calling out a coin but I also don't want to pump a coin too much.  You should spend some time to learn about the differences and make up your own mind.
