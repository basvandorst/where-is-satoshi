What he actually says is there is a 20% chance it goes to zero. Otherwise, **IF** it succeeds it's going to be worth a million dollars.

Not really
Edit: i wonder of all those people downvoting me, how many have ever spent more than a month trying to learn software development. It's not fucking witchcraft or brain surgery.
You know what's hard as fuck? Quantum mechanics. 
You know what isn't? Reading an RFC or learning some basic sorting algorithms.
Are there difficult things in computing? Absolutely, no doubt.
Is everybody who works with software a genius? Not even fucking close

Sure it takes time. But it's no harder than any other craft
Edit: also.... He was replying to why people in software get paid so much. Most are far from masters, and they still get paid solid 6 figure salaries
Most people i meet, are FAR from masters in this craft

My dad gave me one dollar bill
'Cause I'm his smartest son,
And I swapped it for two shiny quarters
'Cause two is more than one!
And then I took the quarters
And traded them to Lou
For three dimes -- I guess he didn't know
That three is more than two!
Just then, along came old blind Bates
And just 'cause he can't see
He gave me four nickels for my three dimes,
And four is more than three!
And then I took the nickels to Hiram Coombs
Down at the seed-feed store,
And the fool gave me five pennies for them,
And five is more than four!
And then I went and showed my dad,
And he got red in the cheeks
And closed his eyes and shook his head --
Too proud of me to speak!

Totally aside from the point..., as someone who grew up before Sponge Bob, it's awesome too see how close the animation is to Ren and Stimpy.
