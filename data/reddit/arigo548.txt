Ah I understand, I did not realize that there was a decryption method via the way I encrypted the wallet.. haha..!
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:59:01
Yeah I understand, but I believe you can scan with the QR code because you're private keys aren't BIP38, whereas mine are...! So I have to decrypt my private key,  then I have to import it..! :)

How is this real news? The website is clearly updated, what more is there to it?

Just any business in general. How can I pay any sort of tax to the government without converting my btc to fiat? How is running a business on btc supposed to be plausible if you must convert your btc to fiat to pay the government taxes?

Which method is a secure way to decrypt bip38?
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:02:09
So why does the future of bitcoin look so promising if I can't run a business off of it?
Not trying to be negative, just curious!
@_date: 2014-08-16 04:05:34
Ahhhh, I understand now - that worked fine.. My mistake
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:06:21
Another question - If I want to print my wallet from say bitcoinpaperwallet.com how would I go about using bitaddress.org to generate the wallet, but bitcoinpaperwallet for the design?
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:51:15
Do you usually import, or sweep the private key?
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:35:34
Also what about change addresses when sending from multibit to a paper wallet, are change addresses involved in this case?
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:19:43
Oh okay I've bought humble before, I should have specifically said DayZ .. I searched on steambits but couldn't find anything to buy DayZ ..
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:22:10
Here is a post you could skim over regarding change addresses real quick,
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:26:12
Sounds easy, then I can just transfer from the blockchain wallet to a multibit wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:30:58
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:48:17
Yeah for sure, doing that now!
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:38:32
Alright awesome, thanks for the help :) I think I am just being a bit too cautious as I haven't done this before.
@_date: 2014-08-16 03:30:40
I would have to decrypt the wallet first if its bip38 then?? I don't see a bip38 import option with blockchain
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:48:33
It says it has 2 confirmations.. What exactly does that mean?? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:30:46
Oooh so I'll still have them, its just they are moving it to their main wallet right.? Thanks.. That makes sense..
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:03:26
Yeah I have multibit - I simply can just open it, create a new wallet and transfer it to that? And from there I can add a password to make it more secure right?
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:35:01
Yeah true enough. Doesn't this kind of eliminate the purpose of it being so secure? If someone simply knows my password they can log in and take my btc?
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:19:08
Also how does it work if I go into a store and want to use btc? I show them my QR code on my phone..?
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:08:41
Thats a good idea, I may do that; When I add a password to my multibit wallet, what exactly does that do..? I just added one but I am never prompted to enter it?? Haha just a bit confused...
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:26:02
Shouldn't it not matter since I successfully got the BTC? They are in my balance in MTGOX, so how are they being withdrawn??
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:15:31
Alright sweet thanks a lot for the help. So technically the only way my btc could be taken is if somebody logs into my computer - and knows my password for multibit? Or could they do it other ways as well..? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:45:02
Okay, I just did a test of a small amount of btc about 15 mins ago.. So it should hopefully be there in a little while..
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:35:24
Phewwww, had a scare for a minute.. Oh boyy!! Thanks so much
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:20:52
Thankss !
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:25:48
But it seems kind of strange to me that someone could open my computer, open this multbit client and then just send bitcoins from my wallet? Or is there a different way you should go about this?
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:30:08
Hmm okay... did you fix anything or no?? I Still have the problem...
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:27:25
The address changes everytime you do a transaction.. So if I deposit btc to the address for my account, next time I want to deposit the address will be different. My account balance is still there, but won't it change after 6 confirmed transactons? I'll see in a minute if it changes or not.. :S
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:21:26
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:54:55
Thanks for the help! Now I don't think itd be wise to have a large sum of btc stored online in persay an mtgox wallet... I should probably transfer it out of that wallet after I get a certain amount of btc right? Or does it not really matter?
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:40:55
Thanks for the clarification, understanding more and more each day.
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:13:11
Okay so in say.. multibit, the client im using, when I create a new wallet, where do I see a public key versus a recieving key? Thanks guys
