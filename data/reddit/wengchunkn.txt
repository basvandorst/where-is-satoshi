See Edit.
Edit: Temperature is the achilles heel of Moore's law. There is a limit how closely Miners can pack ASICS and cool them.
On the other hand, mobile devices will get faster, and by definition, have more space for cooling.
So we might see distributed computing surpasses centralized mining in the future.

As the divergent comments here show, we need to think out of the box to solve this problem.
Here is my solution (see the original Chinese text at the end of this post):
1) Chinese companies in China and overseas make gold and silver bullion with the Chinese zodiac.
2) Chinese and non-Chinese customers will buy these Chinese zodiac bullion as gifts, for weddings, birthdays etc.
3) Because of the sheer number of Chinese in the world, the Chinese zodiac bullion will become the widest circulated bullion and de facto very soon.
4) Money changers everywhere in the world uses the Chinese zodiac bullion as exchange medium to Bitcoin or whatever blockchain currencies people prefer.

Why do u think it is unlikely to make business sense for Bitmain?
They did make AntMiner C1 and U3. 
I am proposing an upgrade of AntMiner U3.
@_date: 2016-11-05 12:14:57
Actually the blog stated that the bitmain mining facilities are sold by blocks to investors. 
So the fear of 51% attack should be alleviated?

Apple is a VERY conservative company.
Check out GNURoot Debian, Android virtualization app to run Linux in user mode.
Why would this not be allowed on iOS?

Obviously you are not a programmer, are you?

And Made in China? Lol.

To answer the original question, if PRC government do that, it would take less than half the time to start another Bitcoin network, wouldn't it?

I m Chinese Malaysian.
I guess u all could use my multilingual (English, Chinese, Malay) ability, plus I started using Linux in 1995.
I can get lots of translators and multilingual Chinese programmers for u too.

According to this article:
-- The S9 has more hashing power than any previous device crammed into its silicon; a massive 14 TH/s (TeraHash per second). A total of 189 chips, spread over 3 circuit boards, are combined to achieve this phenomenal hashrate. 
189 chips for USD 2100. That's about USD 10 per chip.
If Bitmain can produce USB version of AntMiner, with small number of chips, that would make lots of hobbyists miner really happy.

Thanks for clarifying. Bad name. Lol.

They will slow down first.
We are very near FLOPS temperature limit.

Got it. Anything to add?

These must have been well studied.
I just want to save time by asking about preferred theories or simulation code.

How long does it take to get back the cost of one AntMiner S9?
@_date: 2016-11-08 12:13:04
Congratulations. Well done.

I was trying to figure out your rationale. Hence my question.
@_date: 2016-11-04 08:32:41
Not done before. Cannot be "did the math".

Then Miners outside China will be back in business!!
Ain't that good news?

What is stopping mobile phones having ASIC mining chip in the future?
It will be an incentive  for the phone maker, telcos and users.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:30:38
Yeah. Whatever.

China has been at the peak of human civilization for too long. Its only enemy is its own people and mandarins.
Spain and Portugal became hegemons of Europe because of trade with China.
Chinese were not interested in overseas territories because they were all barbarious and too difficult to teach them the Chinese language, compared with Arabic and Latinized languages, which then helped China's Asian neighbours become more civilized and habitable.
Now that the world has caught up in civilization, Chinese will now begin the conquest and reap the fruits.
