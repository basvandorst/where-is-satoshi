It's a legitimate question with some hyperbole attached. My mistake for including that, since it seems dumbfucks like you can't deal with it. 
Fuck off cunt.

K, I guess I should have worded it differently for redditors with the mentality of 12 year olds. Thought mature redditors were in the smaller subs, but I guess it's the same shit everywhere.
Since it seems like I'm not going to get an actual response to this, I'll leave this:
Fuck all of you.

We can agree on that. As I said/implied before, I should not have included "shady as fuck".
Another thing "shady as fuck" is how the post is deleted when I'm not logged on and literally can't be searched for using the search engine. Interesting. W.e. 
In 2 months or something if I remember this sub I'll resubmit the question. Using a different account of course.
Next time please don't be so quick to bash people for relatively innocuous diction like "shady as fuck" though. Being angry at the slightest of things on the internet is pretty fuckin' retarded in my opinion. I'm not the paragon of etiquette or anything, but the reaction to this was just mind-blowingly retarded and embarrassing. I would understand if I posted something that was blatantly flamebait like "OMG BITCOIN IZ SKAM GUISE U SHUD TAK OUT ALL UR COINS!!!``````11111", but this wasn't even close to that fucking level.

Wouldn't call it useless bullshit, since I could have probably replaced "shady as fuck" with "seems strange" and not got all this bullshit. 
It's because my diction showed the subreddit in a negative light, simple as that.

If what you're saying is true, thank you for being the only one answering the question instead of being a passive-aggressive sarcastic little bitch like the others.

No shit I realized that. Hyperbole is not taken kindly in this sub.
Honestly though, it's a fucking overreaction. And completely unwarranted. If shit like "shady as fuck" is enough to start a shitstorm, people are more sensitive than I thought they were.

Thanks for telling me that, but I realized a few seconds after you posted that my question is still sort of unanswered. Why does this subreddit not show the age? It seems strange and unnecessary. Oh well, I'll just let that question die.
Once again, thanks.
