I see your point. I think you are referring to what is called "Hallmarking". It was adopted when NXT was still an infant to protect the network. Now that it can walk, "Hallmarking" is probably not needed at all.
Yes, there still are some big stakeholders. Fewer now than a few months ago. last week a stakeholder decided to dump. He sold about 20 million. And another stakeholder was robbed of 6 million. Im not sure all of those were dumped though. The market price went down, but yesterday and today it is recovering nicely. I think that is an indication of how resilient NXT is to attack.
Im sure you have seen the bitcoin rich list
It is my understanding that the bitcoin devs not only own a very large portion of those coins, but also control many of the the mining pools.
Not good if it is true.

How can a POS coin be "premined" LOL

You bet, nxt has a small army of developers working day and night
check the git

That is an odd comment. What do you mean by "is not trustless?"
It is a decentralized digital currency.
Nxt was not mined at all. It is 100% POS.

It looks like it was the same 9000 or so coins sent over and over to different addresses. A mixer maybe?
