Assuming we can get merchants to run nodes. I don't think it would be practical to challenge ordinary users to run their own nodes. As is the case with segwit, I think the biggest hurdle the lightning network will have to face is marketing.

I call it Bcash sometimes, and i have no resentment towards it at all. In fact, I only found out recently that Bcash was derogatory, which is pretty weird to me.

Maybe consider first that people may just be wrong instead of calling them liars straightaway.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:38
Which is why every time I get involved in a discussion about the failure of segwit, I always try to point out what could have been done (all of which can still be done). It's as easy as editing the sidebar and a few webpages.

Lol this might be the factor that will call for heavy regulation. I don't think it's unreasonable to think that Trump will do this just to regain trendiness.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:42:15
Similar background here. It's sad how many people disagree when others say 75 tests aren't a lot. I deliver features to our software every month and each of those have 20 tests to start with, and then even more when maintenance starts.
People joke about about people pretending to be crypto experts but those people are easy for me to miss. But when the subject is on software development, it starts to become obvious who's talking out of his ass.

They didn't trade for you, because you didn't own the BCash coins to begin with. You're lucky they're even giving you free money. You can't deposit into an exchange despite all the warnings then get pissed when the exchange doesn't completely cater to your entitlement.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:37:03
This type of defense discredits the core team for implementing temporary bandaid features instead of more forward-thinking solutions.

And just before that, people were thumping the hell out of the whitepaper, which laments the costs of using third-party financial institutions.

Because some people here treat bitcoin like a completely infallible religion instead of man-made technology.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:06:35
BTC and BCH are not religions. People are free to support whichever cryptocurrency they think is performing best as an asset or as a technology.

Sounds like someone from academia. A lot of my professors were messy programmers. They wrote incredible software that was difficult to pass on to new developers.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:20:55
XLM too. Thanks to it, my portfolio is the same value as it was when BTC was 19k.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:16:34
There's no way around that, though. What sucks here is we weren't able to trade at all  in anticipation of this move.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:09
The failure belongs to community. The getting-started guide on this sub or bitcoin.org don't showcase segwit. You find segwit information in another page that isn't linked in the getting-started page. The recommended-wallets page doesn't say which ones support segwit. Newcomers are coming in everyday and none of them are starting with segwit addresses. Most of them don't even know what segwit is. This is why exchanges are able to drag their feet with regards to segwit adoption. The majority of their customers don't demand it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:45:04
I like to think that Satoshi was a team of people, not a single person. That or an old man with 3 PhDs.

How about amount of unconfirmed transactions? Bitcoin is undoubtedly the big boss.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:52:39
A lot of these are similar to properties that cryptocurrencies have. Used as decoration. Symbol of success. These are all subjective properties that anything can have from gold to trading cards to autographed tissue paper.
As for the physical properties you mentioned like malleability, conduction, etc., these traits can be easily found in other more common inexpensive metals so no, these traits, while good, are not what make gold expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:45:46
Solutions are needed right now because news coverage is exploding right now. The current state of BTC is not what I want people's first impression of it to be.

Momentum goes both ways though. This could start a chain of merchants letting go of bitcoin as a form of payment.

Negative tax would be an easier concept to sell.

It's ethically fine. We all knew what the consequences were when we deposited into exchanges. They have complete rights to any bitcoin fork. The decision to credit it back to the customers is just a PR move.

Price without value is a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:56
Not a crash but I think it will go from 9k to 7k after the fork. Not so bad considering it was below 6k just last week.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:27:30
Glad to see that I'm not the only one who sees this. Some people here defer discussions to the white paper as if it was the goddamn bible. If you don't know how to answer a question, just tell the person to read the white paper.

From a day trading perspective, VTC most definitely. I hear a lot of bad news about the other coins but it's been mostly blue skies with VTC. Not sure how long this will last but I hope it reaches $10 at least.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:58:19
I got lucky with the coins I chose, but I wouldn't say it was pure luck. My choices aren't made by random. There's a reason why I don't have Unobtanium in my portfolio.

It's called bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:22:22
It depends on how often you trade. If you trade by the hour, which I don't recommend for non-professionals, zoom in on the chart. If you trade by the week, zoom out. Adjust accordingly.

I find day trading fun. I'm a computer programmer with absolutely no background in finance or economics. I like playing games though. When I started treating trading like a game instead of a job, I stopped getting affected by FOMO and started making smarter decisions. Since I started trading like this, I've doubled what my profits would have been from just hodling. It's not a lot, but gains are gains.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:49:39
Nothing special about me. Everything I do is in the comment above.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:06:03
I have the big 3, BTC, ETH and LTC. The majority of my recent earnings have been through VTC because of the S2x altcoin bleed. It went as low as sub-$3 but I was fairly confident about its recovery so I put 80% of my portfolio into VTC which ended up paying off. I could have done the same with most other alts but I believed VTC to be one of my more resilient coins so I went with that.
Before the fork crisis, I'd just been trading between the big 3. Right now I'm waiting for XRP to get pumped so that I can dump it completely.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:11:28
What the hell are you on about?
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:49:36
Here's my rationale for this. If you're hodling a coin, you're banking on it growing in the long term; that any dip that happens should eventually recover (couple this with the fact that no rise lasts forever and that dips happen). Do this for a number of coins and you have a portfolio.
Standing by these assumptions, you sell on the rise (don't wait for it to end) and you spare yourself from the inevitable dip. By buying on the dip, you're you're getting on the inevitable ride back to the top.
The above methodology fails when a coin fails, as was my experience with XRP. This is why I say the risk lies in choosing the right coins for your portfolio.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:04:16
It will take BTC under 6k at most since it was around that range when the the current bull run started.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:24:27
De facto would be a better term, which is what i think the OP means.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:09:33
I'll share mine. I have a portfolio of coins I personally believe in. When a bear run for one coin coincides with the bull run of another, I'll sell the bull for the bear. When the correction happens, I'll end up ahead.
The risk here comes in choosing the wrong coins for your portfolio. Don't chase hype. There is risk involved of course but it's not a lottery, as some people here say. It becomes a lottery when you buy/sell based on numbers and not on news.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:17:31
Yep, there's no easy way to tell if a reduction in price is just an anomaly or the start of a dip. By the time you're sure, it's already too late to sell.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:50:18
It's always advised to hodl and avoid day trading because  people suck at day trading.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:23:39
It needs to have value first to become an asset. At this point in time, bitcoin's value is speculative. A post here the other day made a great point by bringing up the greater fool theory. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:10:49
My professor always told me to aim to become a software engineer and not a programmer because programmers are the basic laborers of software.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:15:40
It will survive, but the event will take crypto a hundred steps back.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:56:23
Selling would be the safer option as you are guaranteed to save money by avoiding interest rates. BTC, however, is speculative. You may win, you may not. I would at least sell before the fork to maximize gains.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:11:26
Bitcoin is a means, not an end. What else would you ultimately use bitcoin for, if not to spend with some time in the future? What would you gain from coins that you hold and never spend? Why don't provide more productive comments instead of patting yourself on the back with some pseudo-witty zingers?

@_date: 2017-11-11 16:31:43
Do you have a source for this or are you just trying to psychoanalyse what the devs could be thinking about?
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:40:09
It depends on how pedantic you want this discussion to be.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:04:28
Perfect attitude to have. We will have mass adoption in no time!
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:48:27
I'm a day trader so price is what matters to me. If you want bitcoin to flourish in the long run, you should care more about value.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:18:45
Because instructions for it are difficult for a newcomer to find. It's not in sidebar. It's not on bitcoin.org's getting started page. Newcomers do not know about segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:47:00
Since we're getting new eyes, might as well introduce people to segwit asap.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:08
Your reply is way off tangent.

@_date: 2017-10-25 16:31:07
I disagree. I'd say you guys jumped the gun.
I refuse to see BTC as BTC until bitcoin gets big enough to drown out the volatility. I'd like to see BTC in terms of goods that it can buy (like i do with fiat) but there is barely any reference for that unless I view it through fiat first. A dollar today buys me almost exactly the same value in goods and services as it will next month.
Overthrowing a monetary system takes a long ass time. People will see bitcoin as bitcoin when it's mature enough.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:07:11
Who knows? My guess is that it would either be through global government crackdown or replacement by a better coin, whichever that may be.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:32:54
It depends on whether the demand is a want or a need.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:01:31
Do NOT cash it out all at once. Take out as much as you need to live well for 2-3 months. I recommend this because of the uncertainties coming this November. When the segwit2x fork happens, DO NOT make any transactions or you could end up losing all your coins. Live comfortably and wait for the fork dust to settle. By December, we should have a clear winner and you can continue using your coins on that.
I also recommend splitting your coins across different wallets.
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:57:40

@_date: 2017-10-24 06:24:09
No, the exchange can perform replay attacks on you and you wouldn't be able to prove it. Transfer to a private address first. The purpose of this is to hide your original address, which is also your bgold address.

I dunno, it sounds a bit... taxing.

If you're investing for the long term, time of purchase shouldn't lose you any sleep. Tomorrow's dip will be yesterday's all time high.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:04:58
Maybe not. But I don't really trust that they will implement it correctly or at all.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:56:12
It's like diversifying, but instead of diversifying with assets, you're doind it with time of purchase. It protects you from investing a lump sum during what might turn out to be a high point in price.
Edit: In my personal opinion, bitcoin is still going through an upward trend so a lump sum would be better in this case. Dollar cost averaging is good for times when prices are relatively horizontal and you're worried about buying at a bad time.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:29:17
I believe the existence segwit addresses should be highlighted in any BTC starting guide. The fastest way to grow segwit usage is to funnel newcomers straight to it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:11:15
What makes me optimistic about bitcoin's future is that the growth we see now is mostly driven by the west. In South East Asia, bitboin is still just a word you'd hear when the wind blows it your way. In my circle of **tech industry** friends, I'd say less than 1 out of 10 people own bitcoin or an altcoin. Outside of tech, most people only know bitcoin by name because they catch a glimpse of it while scrolling through news headlines.
So as much as it has grown these past years, there is more room to grow than people realize. I'd even go as far as saying that even is underestimating just how much room there is for growth.
