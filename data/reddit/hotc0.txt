I understand miners are getting rewarded, but other crypto's incur less fee's. I'm sorry, but, I haven't seen LN be in effect yet :x

thanks! I'll have a look at it

thank you for this reply. I'm really really interested in articles about point  personally I'm having the belief that point  might be slightly outdated. I've read about point  but somehow not everybody agrees to this stance. about  that is not implemented yet and "critics" are very "critical" about it. however, about point  I haven't seen many people complain about a currency that starts with a N and is very small in volume. I appreciate your input.

so, in your opinion, are all alts shitcoins because they are more vulnerable to 51% attacks, because they are not PoW..?

please show me these lighting fast off chain transactions
EDIT: if you think my intention was to troll and waste all of your time, maybe I wouldn't take so much time to read your replies.

thanks for your explanations! all of your answers were very clear.


I'm starting to see that a lot of people in this sub are distrustful towards people asking questions assuming they are trolls. I was not intending to troll but in general i see hostility in replies, which kinda surprised me initially but I guess I understand where it's coming from. too bad, really..

but, I always thought that the price per coin needed to double before the halving took place so that miners will still be able to profit. next to that, increased efficiency in miner technology helps them also (after dumping their old hardware somewhere). I mean, it's like a little space race this way no?
