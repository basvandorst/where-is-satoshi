A bigger blocksize... like a shitcoin?

we are boycotting them for supporting segwit2x and bcash

because they aren't smart enough to think more than 1 step ahead. if miners run a cartel like this they would all destroy their investment and just cause a pow change and chain rollback.

@_date: 2018-05-02 07:54:25

@_date: 2018-05-27 19:37:20
stop using it immediatly. we are currently boycotting bitpay as punishment for trying to increase the block size.

@_date: 2018-05-27 19:17:47

kuz it makes me ANGRY
@_date: 2018-03-11 07:23:31
so people here are trying to argue that there is no network fee for doing this?
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:35:11


Pretty much. only an idiot bitcoiner could possibly prefer increasing the block size to reduce fees last year. these frauds don't understand that bitcoin was never meat to be a payment network, but instead a store of value.
also I thought we were ok with asic boost just not covert asicboost now?
