I've heard many call IOTA a scam. Noone has provided any proof of it though. Care to explain why it's a scam?

It is NOT up to them to prove they're not a scam. When has this ever been the case..? 
Take the justice system. You don't have to prove your innocence, the police have to provide the evidence of your guilt... not the other way around. If I call you a pedophile, should you be considered a pedophile, untill you have proven you're not? Or should I, the accusor, provide the evidence? I seriously don't understand why the participants of the crypto community has to spread FUD with no basis im reality... I'm guessing you own some crypto yourself, why do you take part in destroying peoples confinence in crypto? It doesn't benefit *anyone*.

Depends what kind of parties he attend. If he attend parties of meme-loving kids I bet he's considered lame.

*No* weaknesses? I'm a fan of Bitcoin, but I can think of more than one weakness currently faced by Bitcoin, isn't that why people are still working on and improving Bitcoin. Let's not get ahead of ourselves and talk lies, it will only make us look stupid to everyone on the outside.
