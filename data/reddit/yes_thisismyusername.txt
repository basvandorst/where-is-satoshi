Do you understand the word imply

I appreciate this comment. I hate the idiots in crypto too, they give it a bad name and just want quick gains which isn’t what the community is trying to be 
However, it’s real money that people are losing today. People are depressed enough without getting ridiculed everywhere they go. It’s just human nature to pick a side and throw shit at the other I suppose but it helps to remember you could be taking the piss out of somebody who just lost any hope of sending their kids to college

The word scam implies malice or deception. Everybody knows what Bitcoin is, its nature is transparent. People seek it out and purchase it. So by definition Bitcoin can't be a scam. Bubble? Sure. But scam is just factually incorrect

This is Bitcoin. It's alarming and upsetting and if you're not aware of the volatility you shouldn't invest. If you choose to invest knowing this then you waive the right to moan during the dips. Strong hands are rewarded in this movement and that's just the way it is.

I agree that the most used currency of the future probably isn't in the spotlight yet but I don't know about it shutting all the other coins down easily. I think we'll see it grow (relatively) naturally.

Mansplaining is a sexist word. It's not the sexism that annoys most men though, it's the hypocrisy. For example, many women roll their eyes and make men out to be naive. If the word "womanrolling" arose from this it would be seen by the liberal hive-mind as arrogant and sexist.
Now imagine a prominent woman had a criticism of a man in power. Now imagine articles by male journalists referred to her criticism as womanrolling. 
The reason so many are disenchanted with the left is because they see the flipside of runaway liberal narratives. And its quite easy to imagine the outrage if the roles were reversed. The hypocrisy is what gets under peoples skin. I think this is what the whole divide boils down to honestly. Reversing the roles in situations doesn't even occur to the liberal hive-mind, whereas that's the first thing the other side thinks to do. So in conclusion, I don't think words like mansplaining help anybody, though I can see why it might be hard to see that from where you're standing.

I get this but I don't know if selling is a good idea. Dips like this are an established stage of the Bitcoin life cycle. If you can afford it, treat your $1000 as spent money, and only cash it out when it reaches a specific target (high or low) that you and your wife set together. 
Selling now will just make you look like an idiot and she'll say I told you so, then when it goes back up you'll resent her for it.

I am a liberal. Disqualifying me from being a liberal just for acknowledging the hive-mind really emphasises the toxic, exclusionary nature of the hive-mind. 
And yeah, people are more afraid of hurricanes with male names. Half of those people are women. Not everything to do with gender is a social construct. Some things are inherent, and the perception of men as more physically dangerous than women has been hammered into us since the dawn of the human race. The result? Hurricane bias.
We are not going to change our underlying psychology at its very core. Feminism is equal rights and equal opportunities. Don't turn it into eliminating everything that makes us different from each other

It cost me €20 today to move €300 and it pissed me off to no end. I think it’s as simple as that for most who are complaining, not some sort of external attack. You’d have to be an idiot not to complain about that

A nun is taking a bath when she hears a knock at the door. 
"Sister Agnes" a voice shouts up. "Can i come in?" 
She was about to refuse, but then he said
"It's the blind man from the village." 
"Let yourself in" she said. "I'm upstairs." 
So the man walks into the bathroom and says 
"Hey, nice tits. Where do you want the blinds?"

By that logic investing in gold bullion is a zero sum game

Because of the theory that Bitcoin's S curve of adoption is comprised of hype cycles that see the price increase exponentially until it finally stabilises, allowing it to be used as a medium of exchange as opposed to just a store of value 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:22:48
Correct me if I'm wrong but you're assuming that all value in crypto is generated from people selling at a loss. That implies no intrinsic value. Triple entry accounting is the intrinsic value here. Distributed ledger tech. Decentralized databases. 
The value of cryptocurrency is defined by many things, including but not limited to the reduced costs of a company that uses it.(see Vechain/WTC)
People assume cryoto is just a transfer of value/zero sum game without intrinsic value. That's where the 'ultimate bubble' and 'everything goes to zero eventually' arguments come from. A common misconception.
Capitalism is built on the reality that value can be created and incorporated into the world without somebody having to lose all the time. That's the main reason we don't live in mud huts anymore, and the average person today lives more comfortably than the richest did 100 years ago. 
Yeah daytrading is pretty close to zero sum but investing is not.

Hey everybody listen to this expert!
He bought high, sold low, and *has a feeling* that Bitcoin is no more!
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:36:01
Then how do you suppose it goes up in value 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:25:08
It took just over 1 year for Bitcoin to recover from Mt Gox, which was a much bigger scandal with much less adoption. So "next few years" seems highly unlikely to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:36:30
I am also a skeptic and yes, this community is delusional. Having said that, the rate of change in technology and society today is staggering. Only 10 years ago phones were mostly used to call and text people. It's entirely possible that Bitcoin could become a world currency, and to say that it couldn't because its deflationary and our system is inflationary is a fallacy. Society adapts to the tech just as often as the tech adapts to society.
