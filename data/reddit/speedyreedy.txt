British Columbia, Canada
EDIT: BC is more than twice the size of California. I don't want to travel to get BTC in person, if I can help it.

I have yet to buy a single BTC, despite trying to now for about a month. I find a site, check it out to make sure it is not going to fuck me over, sign up for an account, verify my email, verify my phone number, upload photo ID, upload banking and/or billing information, upload proof of address, go to buy some coins and:
* "sorry, we don't accept Canadian banks yet"
* "sorry, we only accept non-visa interac"
* "sorry, we don't accept Paypal"
* "sorry, we don't accept debit"
* "sorry, we don't accept credit"
"But feel free to put money in an envelope and send it across the fucking country! If it actually reaches its destination AND we aren't actually scam artists, you can expect BTC at a rate which we don't yet know...in about a week. Oh, and don't expect us to sell at the rate other exchanges are selling for - we think the price will rise again, so we'll mark it up a few hundred dollars per coin!"
EDIT: For those who often claim credit/paypal/banks are harder to use:
* Sign up for account
* Link to source of money
* Maybe one or two steps of verification
* Use money, accepted everywhere, without any more hassle

That's a good idea. Maybe I'll have to end up doing it that way.

Yeah, I can see why people don't use Paypal.
Truly, I'm not sure which route I'm trying. I check here or elsewhere to find "Canadian Bitcoin seller" and then after a lengthy and disappointing process have to try another site.
I don't want enough ($1000+) for some sites/traders and I'd rather not mail money somewhere.

Unfortunately I am after a small amount (poor student and all) so most of the offers there are uninterested in anything under $1000.
