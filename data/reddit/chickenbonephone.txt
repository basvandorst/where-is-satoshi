They know full well how outdated their systems really are. If they had any real guts or glory, they'd actually step up to the pump and try to use the technology for the betterment of the world and society. To be fair, this is a few months old - maybe there has been some change.  
*"We already have an amazingly abstract ... you know..." Panel and audience, "HAHAHAHA!"* Oh that's precious.  
Edit: Was just thinking that it's kind of funny how he claims that the current monetary system is "amazingly abstract" and yet, somehow, Bitcoin is *more* abstract? I'd say it's less abstract and simpler, if anything. Whether or not that's good or bad is another issue, but apparently the more abstract a currency is the better it is? Hard to follow.

We need a machine that turns food waste into pellets or coins to be used for buying more food.

Looking forward to this. If more people, or just the younger generations, were privy or informed of the 2008 collapse, its reasons, ramifications, and results, we'd likely have some heads practically rolling in the streets. Some people still need to go to jail or prison over it. Personally, when I think about it, I get borderline rageful - I know, undoubtedly, what some of those/these "leaders" *willingly* allowed/allow to happen and it makes blood boil. They will not get away with the largest, wonton and willing destruction of the world's wealth in the history of mankind - We will not allow it.
