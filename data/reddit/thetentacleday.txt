I buy via via blockchain.info. This is the third post about blockchain.info I make in the span of 5 minutes, so clearly I'm a shill.
However, that's how I buy mine. I go to the Buy Bitcoin option in the menu, put in the sum and that's that.
They partner with Conify. I buy with a card, 3% fee. Works with me.
I also sometimes just stomach the fee and transfer a large sum into Kraken and have at it.

Yes, you can export your private key via a twelve word backup. If anything goes wrong, you can always access your fund from any other wallet.
Go to your security settings, it should be there. I think it's called a wallet back-up.

Give up your US citizenship and move to the EU. If you can prove you're prepared to invest 100.000k in a business in the EU, you can get citizenship.
I mean hell, you would want to invest that anyway if you're smart.

BCC is the continuation of Bitcoin as it was before segwit. it is the non-altering of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:34:47
Get your facts straight. BTC-e assisted in laundering the Mt. Gox hack coins, they didn't 'steal from US citizens'.
Even if they did, still doesn't give a country jurisdiction to arrest and 'seize' an entire business just because they feel like it.

Kinda late to the party but I'll allow it.

First they need to take care of their website.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:20:07
August 1st, mail order.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:41:25
Mate, ViaBTC just launched the split, it's trading there right now. The hardfork will happen on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:02:19
Quite the opposite. ViaBTC is splitting it today.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:25:29
So by that argument, the Russian intelligence office should have the liberty to go into the U.S, put someone under arrest, and close their business.
Gotcha. That wouldn't cause WW3. Nope.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:29:14
I can jack it to this.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:55:25
I agree. What the fuck America? I understand more and more every day why some countries are so vehementely opposed to your 'influence'. You've littered the world with military bases under the guise of peace and now you're exerting that force and terrorizing the general populace with strong arm tactics to get them to do everything you want them to do.
Not cool, it will only alienate more and more people. This is coming from a person citizen of a country that has a very large percentage in support of the U.S.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:40:19
Exactly the opposite. I 'traded' for a fully year, intensely. I always bought high and sold low, like a maniac.
I gave up before it became an issue.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:46:47
Neah, with bitcoin you buy and you strap in for the moon. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:05:58
lol, mate, bitcoin already dropped like that several times in the past. I remember when I bought at 1300 and it dropped back to 300... way back, was a november tho. I think 2013.
that's just one of them, there were several more. you might not see it as a raw value (because the max price was lower) but as a percentage, it happened before.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:29:37
Hei Jessie, that's understandable. The problem is that your system in which photos are uploaded is broken. I have sent over a rather large, detailed photo taken with the latest available Galaxy S8 Camera. This camera has as much detail as showing the pollen of a bee's legs, yet your support team first said the photo cannot be opened, and then after sending it again, the exact same photo, a different response was given, that the photo is blurry. I'm looking at it right now and I can read the details of my ID from 5 feet away from the screen.
Thank you for your offer to help, but I've decided against using Xapo again. A security process is redundant if it prevents the account owner from doing what a hacking would prevent them from doing as well: access their (empty) account.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:38:43
They accused a single person of laundering 4 billion dollars, but when JP Morgan and co crashed the world markets, that was fine.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:12:46
Don't put words in my mouth you poop. I didn't say anything of the like. I said a country shouldn't have the authority to go in another country, arrest foreign citizens and close down their business.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:53:09
My parents told me 'don't touch that' hundreds of times. Still touched that and got burned.
Here's the thing, 'ya dick'. Idiots don't learn. They don't educate themselves, that's why they are in that predicament to begin with.
I'm not the smartest cookie either, but I do know this much: every time I fuck up, I make sure I learn something.
So whatever, have it your way. Try to spoon feed everyone, but my mother hasn't learned not to click on the fucking popup ads to this day, no matter I've been telling her the same thing every month for the past 10 years.
My father was the same, until someone had a go at his credit card. You should see the precautions that man takes now.
So whatever man. All I'm saying is, we never did get rid of the nigerian prince.
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:26:20
Oh yeah, definitely. Most people just want the instant gratification of buying bitcoin outright but you could double your stash for the same investment if you mine it instead.
Definitely go for it. Make sure you mine ZCASH and Dash too.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:51:11
nice. good for you. keep doing the lord's work son.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:54:03
To what end?
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:38:37
It really isn't. There are only two buttons on your most simple trade options on any exchange: BUY and SELL. Both behave the same.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:33:21
Satoshi was counting on this. Consensus rule. Whether you like it or not, you can keep whining as much as you want: everyone is free to make their own choice, BCH wouldn't exist without the support. If it lives, it has the support. If it dies, you were right and everyone was wrong.
There's no need to call it an attack. It's doing exactly what it was meant to do.
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:08:46
Never heard of Bitpanda. How is this the most popular European bitcoin whatever?
Bitstamp and Kraken are, and a host of others. Bitpanda not so much.

You can be an idiot as long as you continue to hodl.

@_date: 2017-07-22 21:12:57
I wouldn't call it extremely but okay, whatever. I've been with blockchain.info since they launched. it's one of the oldest wallets there are and they never gave me reason not to trust them. never had any issue. just make sure you've got 30 minutes to go through each and every security setting and lock it down.
also, if you don't lock down your email in full as well, I won't be surprised if you get 'hacked'. stupid people gonna stupid, and prefer burying their half a bitcoin in their garden instead. jesus.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:56:29
Bitcoin. It's going to be named Bitcoin once consensus switches over. You know why? Because that's the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:59:24
which he can, with the blockchain.info wallet. just go to settings &gt; security and make a wallet backup. boom, take your seed and go to any other wallet if you so wish.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:00:59
Yes. Maybe...
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:37:42
Whoever gets tricked by this deserves it. Be your own banks means something a hell of a lot more than what people think.
Idiots deserve it. You all deserve it. 90% of the time, every time.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:14:20
Just go to your 'Buy Bitcoin' section in your wallet and select 'Sell'. It's right there, you don't need to move your coins anywhere.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:51:35
Yeah, price is gonna drop for BTC and increase for BCC, since BCC becomes an actual real coin, or the continuation of Bitcoin how some put it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:58:03
You weren't pulled in WW1. Your leadership caved in to zionist pressure and brought the U.S into 'the business' because war means money for the U.S. It did then and it does now.
The same thing happened with Pearl Harbour. The Japanese were played and suckered into attacking the U.S - and that's no reason to go to War with Europe if you REALLY want to stay out of it.
Go fuck yourself and educate yourself. The Americans had no place in taking place in both WW1 and WW2 and frankly, it's their fault for creating WW1 and WW2 in the first place. Had they stayed in their own country, WW1 and WW2 would have never happened.
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:03:48
Hoe much you've got? Keep 1-2 coins in your hot wallet so you can spend, I recommend blockchain.info or Xapo and the rest in a cold wallet, I recommend a plain old brainwallet with a password - 
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:36:19
ViaCash. Do you even know what Bitcoin Cash is?
Let me enlighten you: Google Satoshi's whitepaper, read the title, emphasis on cash.
Second clue: Bitcoin Cash = Bitcoin pre-segwit, i.e Bitcoin today more or less. Bitcoin Cash is simply not doing anything to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Segwit is the attack if you really want to keep calling it that.
I'm neither pro or against Bitcoin Cash, but I hate shills and idiots with a passion.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:55:39

I mean, I guess an English speaking country would suit best? Here's the UK: 
Have you thought about investing in east Poland? :)))
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:48:59
no. not all. it's a hot wallet. people should understand what the difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet  is, otherwise they're gonna have some problems anyway. byob has advantages and disadvantages.
You don't have to be invulnerable, you just have to avoid being a low hanging fruit. that means keep your hot wallet thin and your cold wallet out of reach.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:39:57
And you made a fatal error: you didn't stop and ask why there are so many short positions and where they are coming from.
Find that answer, you'll change the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:57:31
Well, there will be two coins because there are two ideologies. One is Bitcoin with SegWit2x and the other is Bitcoin without it.
Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin ABC are the same thing. They are Bitcoin without Segwit in any shape or form, so basically, regular flavour Bitcoin.
You should decide based on what idea you support, not necessarily where the highest price is.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:31:15
Funny, those exact (less the names) words can be applied from the other side. After all, Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin is now, but not after August 1st. So in reality, witcoin is the new guy on the block for all intents and purposes.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:01:03
I don't fucking know who the other people are. Where the fuck do you think you are, in some friendly happy merry go round circle with another 20 of your friends?
This is an open forum on one of the most popular websites on the Internet. Thousands of new accounts are made and deleted every day.
Way to go there Sherlock. You've spotted me. I'm a paid Chinese shill trying to push BCH by talking to idiots on reddit.
Fuck right off. I came back a month ago, panic sold everything and then educated myself on what the hell is going on. As soon as I had my bearings and did as much research as I could, I had a decision to make.
And my decision was that I'd rather have Bitcoin as it was so far, because I'm afraid of change which has resulted out of 2 years of arguments, and it's a breakup, not a change.
So I bought back in. I'll hold both coins and see how that goes. I would still prefer for this not to have happened. Segwit modifies Bitcoin beyond recognition to me. It is the altcoin in my head and BCH is the original one, because of a simple reason: it only exists because some of us don't want the 'absolutely required change'.
As soon as I learned of Segwit there was one single thought in my mind 'can I opt out of this?'. I don't trust the Chinese, I don't trust a Chinese with way too much power, but I'm grateful for providing the opt-out.
EDIT: Also, Ima delete this account right after the fork. So I can start fresh. Thank god for the interwebz.

Why the fuck does a US police have jurisdiction to arrest a Russian citizen, in Greece, for operating a business outside of the US?
'They had US customers' - so fucking deal with your citizens then, lock them up for committing the crime, not shut down the business'.
'Their servers were in the US' - really, and that makes it alright? Seize the servers, shut them down.
What if Coinbase is breaking the AML of some other European country, do you think that country would march into the US and shut down Coinbase and arrest their board? Come on. What the fuck.
I know, theft is wrong - but the way this has been done is a lot more wrong to a lot more people for a lot more time from now on.
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:46:41
Yeah, pretty much. I mean you can like, go to your security and make a wallet backup. I think I just told another guy just this. That way you get your 12 words and be done with it, you can import your wallet anywhere else should anything go wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:53:06
Lol, yeah that exact part made me stop and wonder what was I doing with my life when I was trying to sign-up with them at 3am and trying to find my damn area code. they sorted it by the chinese name, insane.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:52:08
So...? Still doesn't give the U.S jurisdiction (or shouldn't) to close a business in another country and arrest the citizen of a different one altogether.
Law don't matter for them U.S boys, only when they have something to gain from it, then it's all about 'justice'.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:48:19
Just google 'buy bitcoin' and click on the first (non-ad) link.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:03:48
Well, BCC is now launched and actually seems to be doing alright. Let's see what happens.

@_date: 2017-07-30 13:43:01
So you go to Security and select the 'Wallet Backup' option. It'll give you a 12 word seed which is basically your private key. you should be able to import that into a different wallet.

I agree with him. Just because I agree with that idea doesn't make me a shill, an idiot or a bad person. That's exactly what I want: the same bitcoin that we've always had. Satoshi himself proposed a scaling solution: 
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:10:38
First thing to do when launching a new online anything, especially if it involves money: ban the U.S in their entirety from ever accessing any of your content, website, put a legally binding disclaimer for all US citizens and never host or have any interaction with the US.
They'll still come after you, just like they did with Kim, who himself never even visited the US, like hundreds of others who were forcefully taken from their cucked homelands, and now they do it to Alex, but at least you'll have a fighting chance: you can prove you do not wish to have any connection to anyone within the US whatsoever. Try shifting the burden on them. It's ridiculous, US citizens committing 'crimes' and the place of their crime is being shut down, in its entirety, because fuck the rest of the world?
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:21:52

I've had this happen with numerous companies in the EU and I always thought the same thing: that's fucking illegal.
Amazon does it too. They can 'disable' your access to the account, but the account and all the information in it stays. If you ask for it to be deleted, they even say they did so, but they just deactivate it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 05:59:03
Yes. For them over there I hear it's now the new normal. They call it 'civil forfeiture'. They need some freedom, I think they exported too much of it.

Jesus. This is big.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:48:17
So I have to have an account for how long before being taken seriously?
There are some idiots who keep the same reddit account, always.
Then there are the other types of idiots, the paranoid type, who change their accounts every now and then. I see no joy in retarded badges. There are no incentives to have a long standing account. There have been more than one witch hunts for something someone said or did, tracked them down via their reddit account. Neah, no thanks.
So whatever mate. Ad hominem. Discussion ends here.
