I've lived in the US all my life. I can count that number. Zero. 
Your rant seems a bit misplaced. The entire country does not reflect your narrow experience. There are good parts and bad parts.

There's no talking to people with black and white thinking. No middle ground means no room for discussion.

Peace of mind, yes, but it's gone way up at retailers like Amazon. Even Trezor is charging a 20 Euro premium *each* for immediate shipping (that's 20 on top of their shipping charge). You can pay their regular price of 89 Euros (plus shipping), but only if you wait til February 2018. 
 You can see the priority charge when you add it to the cart. 
Ledger Nano S hasn't experienced quite as bad of a price spike, and is available at the manufacturer for 58 Euros.

I put one in my shopping cart on the site... its 131 Euros with shipping, or $155.68. I'm probably still going to get it.

High fees and slow transactions are what is wrong with it. High fees mean that people can't buy it and use it for everyday transactions. Slow transactions also hinder it from being used for everyday purchases. Larger investors putting large sums of money into it will drive prices for a while until that is resolved, and possibly after.  


I don't think that was part of the original white paper.

I always thought the lesson of "The Boy who Cried Wolf" should be to replace the boy if he's unreliable. Using their logic, if those villagers had unreliable fire alarms that went off when there was no fire, they would have ignored them and them and let the village burn, then beat up the fire alarm afterwards.

There were some people claiming it would be some sort of anti gravity device he'd invented. 
Of course this would have been the the most world changing discovery of the last 1000 years.. and some still believed some inventor discovered the physics behind anti gravity and made a practical device with it and still managed to keep both the discovery and the invention under wraps. 
It ended up being a two wheeled electric skateboard.  Way too much hype.

Well put. It's usually intentional. If you wonder why things are the way they are, look at who benefits.
