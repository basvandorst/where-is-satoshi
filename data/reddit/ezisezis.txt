No not really. They do have fees. They act as the middlemen taking their cut for providing a platform

Those are not the actual coins as the blockchain is not even forked yet, those are only the futures.

Nobody knows. If people would know, they would do it. Think for yourself and if unsure, just wait for signals.

Everyone has their own personal preference. I prefer kraken because it is easier for europeans (me included) and has quick depositing and payout schemes.

I would suggest:
*) reading "Mastering Bitcoin" to understand the tech;
*) Do not use mobile wallets, do not keep money on exchanges;
*) Compare some exchanges because prices are different and the brokerage fees are not that high if you plan on just buying once. Kraken often has good prices and small fees;
*)  Avoid mining and forget about it. It is only profitable with a specific hardware called ASIC and it requires a lot of investment and understanding.

Many exchanges have made it clear that they also support the fork and will be crediting its users BCC at the exact amount as BTC so probably many decided that they will not be moving and the trading continues.

A quick project I did on my Mac to display your crypto currency portfolio on your Touch bar. When pushing the button, it shows portfolio value in BTC. If anyone is interested, check out the repo -  P.S. Not my portfolio in the pic :D (I wish :D)

Yes, you just transfer your funds to the hardware wallet address. In kraken funding section you can cash out bitcoin by providing a receiving address.

Yay finally. To the moon ��

University of Copenhagen is also offering some course on Blockchain ��

Otherwise they would be doubled.

How does this impact the price? My understanding is that a negative signaling would leave a large damage, can someone elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:32:51
Yes but for every transfer you have to pay transaction fees. Best are Trezor or Nano Ledger S

Yes I'm on the edge as well on whether to acquire more or not... I guess it's a bit of a gamble, but could pay off well.

This was my starting point, it is the perfect entry point for newbies, it explains blockchain technology in detail and builds a great foundation to understand how other coins work. Highly suggested!
