Pretty much. I thought i would sit down and draw out my down falls and let others experience it from my pov. Most of us think it can never happen to them, as did I, but here I am now. So I made this account just to share the details. I just need to figure out how to post it all in good enough detail. I'm no writer.

I fell for this today. A series of dumbass events and lack of judgement lead me to it. I'll be sharing it with all you guys so you can laugh at me, standby.

I fell for this today. Not proud of it. 
I'm about to write about it and share my shortcomings with you all.

To some people, not a lot, but to me it was the majority of the BTC portfolio that I've been building up the past couple months.
Don't wanna say how much, yet, but I'll say the scam stated to send between .1 btc to 5 btc

In short, yes. In long, I wasn't in a good state of mind at the time. Now that I'm actually rested, I feel even more stupid.

There was a few stipulations that made me to think it was ok. For example, I don't have social media accounts. I stopped when myspace fell apart. So the verified Twitter account marked with that blue checkmark was unknown to me. But also, this scam was posted on McAfees official Twitter, as a lookalike post. I just saw it early enough that it wasn't deleted. I'll explain more in a post, but everything wasn't so straight forward
