Shouldn't this be posted in @_date: 2016-08-26 06:38:22
This doesn't sound all that good for increasing adoption of bitcoin as a trustworthy payment vehicle. Thanks for explaining!
Oh and "Boo Sally".
@_date: 2016-08-11 09:53:15
I'd just quit talking about bitcoin altogether - this only adds to the frustration. I would, however, try to convince your friend to really read a bit more about Onecoin and the lack of exchanges pairing this 'coin'. Of course, there's enough video material on youtube about Onecoin that just screams pyramid-scheme. But that's just my opinion :)
@_date: 2016-08-17 10:26:26
Via what wallet did you send?
@_date: 2016-08-18 13:02:45
The shown behaviour is akin, though.

I like this reasoning, thanks for sharing.

Locally/offline?  be sure to read up front what best practices are.
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:01:37
I guess the reason is the discussion is more applicable at @_date: 2018-01-28 21:01:02

Try to focus on the better things in life for now - your gf, your family. The non-monetary stuff, as that's just money. Trust on your own skills as you state: you're good at something that most of us could only dream of. Focus your energy on that. Best of luck, man.

Ooh that's even more interesting than I thought!

Surely you have a spare? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:58
Don't we need LN implemented first for this? Or can these improvements be implemented in parallel and without order?

Very interesting insight.

The mempool growth is kind of weird in terms of shape, but I tend to agree with your proposed cause. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:02:05
I was wondering, with LN channels open, would we be able to see and count all trx, to come to a TPS for the bitcoin network? Got me puzzled where to obtain such information once we have LN in place...

@_date: 2017-02-25 18:36:11
It certainly would hurt adoption, no? Adoption/usage is key, eventually. I agree it doesn't destroy bitcoin and the protocol, but the events above would surely hamper adoption and could push it in a downward spiral. No matter how great the technology behind it.
@_date: 2017-02-24 12:50:12
Add to the list:
- Bug like DAO/eth mishap
- A chain of Gox-like events
- Satoshi moving/selling his old coins all at once

I'm not sure that, concerning the questions you raise, you'd be ready to put real money into btc. Read into it more before buying, I'd say. You definitely started at a proper forum to ask questions.
To answer your question (and I'm putting *emphasis* on each aspect of bitcoin you should read into): you can put fiat money on *crypto exchanges* and buy btc via that route, or via *Localbitcoins.com*. You can store your *private keys* which are linked to bitcoin in a *wallet* or leave your coins stored on an exchange (not recommended: read into *mtgox*, *bitfinex*).
There is tons of info around and I can't stress enough that this is no simple matter and should be properly understood before putting money into it.
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-02-22 13:45:09
You can buy a fragment of btc, say 0.01 btc. It can be a nice long-term gift, thoug who knows. At least it's a nice conversation topic, in any case.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:00:19
'kind of new to trading' and 'a sum of money/50k'. Doesn't sound like a solid plan to me, to be honest. Leveraging/margin trading can separate you and your cash in an instant.
Still, out of curiosity, what are you betting on? ETF approval or disapproval/delay?
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:45:04
I'm not sure, but I'd rather see the coins distributed evenly over every person on earth. Not sure how to do such a feat in an easy way, though.
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:45:01
highly unlikely ;)

Dutch people call it 'polderen': finding common ground between opposing views. Giving in a little, so both sides commonly gain in the end. Needs a bit of level-headedness though - and that takes time.
@_date: 2017-03-07 07:28:19
Honest question, why would Core devs continue to build/code on their Bitcoin version, when it's *highly unlikely* that segwit will ever be implemented?
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:50:32
Looks c00l, though.
@_date: 2017-02-22 12:39:00
'to' exchanges, or 'on' exchanges? 'to exchanges' doesn't make sense to me, can you elaborate?

Not sure whether it's wise to only look at the past to estimate a future. For all we know it'll be pushed off its throne and be replaced by better tech/adoption.

It's all about *purchasing power*. Surely, 1 btc will hit an unprecedented fiat figure, but it's not only because of appreciating btc. It's also about depreciating fiat/inflation.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:30:01
That's the denomination and doesn't really say much about value. Value is defined differently, network effect for example, or the fungability or adoption.
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:12:44
Depending on the amount you're willing to invest/store in BTCs, you could consider a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger. It gives peace of mind and should give you enough safety against compromised computers.
In general, if you're the kind of person who can lose sleep over it, I'm not sure BTC are right for you at the moment.
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:27:18
Quarterly futures already passing $1000, so I think those final days are going to be interesting.

Nice and all, but don't get your hopes up. It's not very likely, as tech savvies (eary btc miners) will not simply throw out a hdd with their btc on it. I wish you all the best, but just don't let this thought control your next two weeks :)

Don't invest in something you don't understand enough, would be my advice. Crypto is, in many ways, still high risk investment material.

You're talking about 'Satoshi Nakamoto' - who might have been a group of geniusses for all we know. If you read the initial bitcoin paper, you'll know why many people consider Satoshi a genius.

...Plus you'd risk being out of balance when you want to use LN yourself, which I thought to be quite an annoyance and thought this to be a major flaw. Now, the article described an elegant solution with the 'non advertised' paths. Thanks for that!
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:41:11
Simplest idea would be to store the seed (with a manual perhaps) in a safe place as what you'd do with that old antique necklace your grandmother gave.
Then again, I'm convinced a lot of btcs will be lost forever because of someone not properly giving his/her relatives access to the coins after the hodler passed away. Compares to hidden treasure without a treasure map.

@_date: 2017-04-27 07:22:42
But when reading the term you immediately knew it stands for something alarming, right? I guess it's label serves its purpose, then.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:08:10
Can't admit this analogy makes it easier to understand. Why not trying to visualize pre vs post in terms of size. Picture says a thousand words and should make it clear where both visions of the matter do not allign. Any takers for the challenge or know of the existence of such a visual/graph? (I myself are getting more confused every day)
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:05:46

Might be true, but mass adoption guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:29:36
You're absolutely right, and my comment wasn't too serious :)
Actually, you spending coins adds to the adoption of Bitcoin, so we all should be glad with it. Refilling your stash sounds like a good idea though.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:15:30
Welcome. treat yourself to some good night rest and buy a HW wallet such as the Ledger Nano. Looks cool too.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:32:26

Adoption of BTC as a payment option for coffee.

You might be able to mine a few alts for profit, although it's not very likely to be worth the hassle.

@_date: 2017-05-31 09:39:56
Never selling, hmm? Not even buying stuff with BTC? Wouldn't then your stash be worthless to you, in a way?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:23:36
Not to mention the absence of the "." at the end. Oh, the horror.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:19:29
I'm still figuring out the 'Aug 1' deadline - how 'hard' is this deadline? What do long-term hodlers do with their stash just before this deadline? If I'm selling (a portion) of my coins, am I part of the FUD or or am I doing the most sensible thing?

This time it's different (tm).
Without sounding cynical, it just might be different this time. Interesting what will happen to BTC when the altbubble pops - that's a lot of capital inflow which most likely end up in Bitcoin.

Why not both? Holding up a "Save Bitcoin" sign?
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:11:00
I agree, the 2mb hf still not a sure thing for me. I want to believe, but I'm not convinced all parties keep their word in the end.
@_date: 2017-05-05 06:30:50
Don't let the tax stuff kill your buzz for now. You should be proud of a very nice and financially sound start of your life. Congrats!

Unless you think the value of fiat is near full collapse, I'm not with you, good sir.

Having a terminal disease implies, in my view, that time is not on your side. This is the crucial element for investing in Bitcoin, no matter how rollercoaster'y Bitcoin is. I hope the eventual upward swing is in sync with your lifespan horizon.

Can I list a few? 
* Dollar Cost Averaging. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
* Not your keys? Not your coins. Don't leave coins on an exhange for a prolonged period of time.
* Scams abound, it's still the Wild West. Invest accordingly.
* Don't take any trading advice from anyone. Do your own due dilligence and convince yourself of what to do. No one knows what will happen in cryptoland, ever.
* Don't let emotion take over during 'crashes' - Hodl.
* Daytrading is difficult and most of us will not profit in the end.
* Wishing you read into Bitcoin more when you first heard about it (somewhere in 2014). Be glad you're here now, during the early adoption years.
* Never a dull moment in Cryptoland. Enough watercooler stories to get by with likeminded colleagues.

Bitcoin could go steeper.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:26:46
If we would all think alike, there wouldn't be a market.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:47:18
Obviously a very unclear question. Please try again.

Some sort of smart contract.
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:14:58
Which reference price will you use? Stamp?

Perhaps it's answered somewhere, but, do we know whether Jihan remains profitable without ASICboost? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:53:44
This. Buying and holding off-exchange is the best passive strategy, imo.

Actually, I was thinking about decrypting tools specifically made for certain ransomware. Most will get cracked or otherwise compromised. But quantum is also good :)

Seems like a 'sell, sell, and sell' to me. You got that often, people misinterpreting your recommendations?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:57:07
Can't say I'm going to miss the scaling bickering that divided the community for this long.
@_date: 2017-07-05 08:18:58
I'm done with the negativity and the mudslinging. Upvoted OPs message. Make Bitcoin Great Again.

Slim chance is slim. But it's a treasure hunt nonetheless :) Good luck!

How cool! Now I can buy me some art :)
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:57:08
To think that *I* was a bit paranoid.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:03:29
Photofinish perhaps? It strikes me that the 'last' signaling party has such power on the future of the protocol and thus the price of Bitcoin. Seems to me this be an easy way of making a few extra bucks riding these volatile price waves.
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:49:05
Didn't he propose some sort of 1:1 promise/deal/agreement regarding BTC/BU, a while back?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:59:24
That's okay. I like the approach though. This measurement says way more than other calculations.

It's called SgtSpike's Law.

if the confirmations are not there yet, try to double spend with larger trx fee?
Otherwise, I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:49:09
Has there always been a blocksize limit in the past?
@_date: 2017-06-21 08:40:57
Humans are hardwired to see patterns, even when there aren't any patterns to be found. Let's wait and see how the dominance % develops.

Fractional Reserve, Quantitative Easing. Google is your friend.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:22:00
Seriously, wait it out if you're not going to pay the ransom. There's bound to be a decryptor available, in the end.
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:43:31
I would call is *forced* consensus, but it's a step forward nonetheless.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:50:24
Isn't that the point of DCA?

Comforting words of a captain during stormy weathers. Following your posts from now on. Thanks!

Ok guys, party hats back in the closet until Segwit is definately locked in.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:25:26
Soon it's only a fraction you can afford.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:41:17
aka... ok.
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:43:39
Sorry, that moneys gone. Onecoin is a proven scam.

@_date: 2017-06-19 18:32:55
So the period between part 1 and part 2 is flexible?

A bit more fun and a much less ranting, that's what this community is in dire need of. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:42:07
Am I wrong to think that the amount of addresses don't really mean much? It's not a very good indicator of increased adoption, I think.
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:01:51
Why oh why can't Bitcoin's price be just the inverse of the steadily inflated-away USD.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:25:18
Awfully silent around BU.
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:11:24
Not sure it'll be such a phenomenon, but the moving of, say, 1000 of old, near-genesis block coins could be a headline on business news, impacting markets.
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:56:52
Let's hope Reddit devs take notice and start implementing its potential outside of the crypto subreddits.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:26:20
haha, made me smile :)
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:46:51
Am I the only one who welcomes the concentration of this discussion again on one subreddit, instead of both and While there are differences, it's good to have constructive discussions instead of mud-slinging from both sides. The real issue, imo, is not within btc, but the surge of alts and valid alternatives like eth, showing the btc community once again we have to resolve our disputes before it's too late and the crypto-boat has sailed without good old bitcoin on board.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:45:11
a bitcoin treasure hunt? :D nice!
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:07:17
So do I understand it correctly that it may very well be possible only the first part of Segwit2x could be implemented (segwit) and the second part (2mb) could (due to 'unforeseen developments' / code-not-ready) not be implemented in the end - resulting in a Segwit-only end solution?
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:17:03
What's to hear?
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:40:54
I think we need an FAQ on this specific topic, with all 'ifs and thens' covered.

Does she show signs of manic depression?
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:09:00
But one new address does not equal one new user. We can only guess how many of the newly created wallets equal new adopters.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:19:49
Better start an ICO before that fad is gone.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:36:58
Uhm, didn't we change the blocksize already in the past? Why is that a precedent per se, and why would that be something negative?
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:41:48
Will be an epic pic in ten years.
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:40:00
Hardware wallet like a Ledger or Trezor, if you're serious.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:51:53
Then I dont understand people mentioning that the 2mb part might never happen.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:56:44
...and don't lose sleep over price swings.
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:35:26
Care to explain what the damage of a blocksize increase is, aside from small (non-)arguments like propagation?
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:09:32
Iconomi. Nice and friendly community.

That's the sauce mentioned in Rick and Morty, right?
