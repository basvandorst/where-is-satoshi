What are you on about?
I like my subreddits nice and clean.

I have a *raging* Overstoke.

What the fuck man

Well obviously you're right...I'm not gonna insist that it's interesting, but I thought the situations were interesting and I guess I just found the number of users using it to teach and preach amusing. 
Dad wouldn't give a teen $100 to invest so, as if knowing it was going to skyrocket, a redditor did. And if he actually sat on it per the advice, he's rich. 
Guy doesn't understand bitcoin value so he gets tipped 0.15 bitcoin. Maybe he forgot about it until seeing it in the news 6years later.

Holy shit lol

Oh wait...so the bot keeps the bitcoin and pays out USD?
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:25:58
They love Bitcoin, they just don't know it yet! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:27:02
It's a currency too. Many retailers accept bitcoin as a form of payment. 
Just because people are using the currency as a high tech casino doesn't mean that's how you classify it.

Luckily reception on reddit indicates the opinion of only like 10,000 people at absolute max. Probably less than a hundred on these buried posts.

Its OK, I got the joke.
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:23:04
That smiley face thing didn't help.

I've seen them in the news regularly preforming breakthroughs.  Crazy how they've turned their game around in four years; what happened?  New CEO or something?
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:22:34
In that case, I'll send him my son posthaste!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:53:34
Is it true that you consider punctuation a tool of Satan?
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:40:39
That's what they said when it went from 30 per to 110 per, months (?) ago.  Hasn't been that low since.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:50:38
Yeah!  Those heroin addicts too.  Just stop, guys!
