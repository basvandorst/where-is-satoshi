This is the most ass-backwards analysis possible.  Putting up large sell orders sets a ceiling for the price.  It doesn't nothing to "prop" the price up.  Contrast with putting in a large buy order, which does prop up the price. 
If a whale buys up all the coins all the way to $630 and puts them all on sale for $628, nothing is stopping anyone from selling theirs for less.  And a lot of people probably would, because a huge sell wall at $628, strongly implies that it'll be tough to get any higher.  Putting up a sell order for 5000 btc and $628 means the price won't go above $628 until someone buys at least 5000 btc.   In the mean time, anyone can go put an order in for $600 or whatever they feel like, and people can buy at that price.  You can support the price by putting in sell orders like you can ride a dildo to the moon.
**Buy** orders support the price.  **Sell** walls put a ceiling on it.  
Watching numerous people apparently see no problem with your analysis makes me wonder if you did this on purpose to punish the stupid and/or newbie people or something.  That's cruel.  If it was an honest mistake, you should probably get the fundamental concepts down before you start pontificating like that. 
And to the guy who thinks this needs to be "engraved in everyone's mind", are you smoking crack??  I would un-engrave that from your mind stat if I were you.  It's not slightly incorrect -- it's completely backwards.

It was a great contribution. It made him feel smart, and only about 17 people had already said the exact same thing.
