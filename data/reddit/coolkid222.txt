Currently locked out, waiting till like 3 am EST in order to just finish verification HOPEFULLY.

Can you list some out? I came here as a last resort after trying everything I could.

You seem concerned that people wont mine bitcoin because it wont be profitable. You need to understand the game theory behind mining bitcoin. When it is not profitable for some people they will leave , adding profitability to everyone else continuing to mine. If everyone stops mining but me, i get all block rewards. It will never get that low.

Id love to buy bitcoin and hold but every exchange is locked out of letting me get verified so i cant use my bank account to fund my bit coin buying, which means i have no crypto currency, which means I cant buy more cryptocurrency with cryptocurrency. This verification stuff is ridiculous.

Nope and I failed the test again today, it asks the most impossible questions like "Who of these  people do you know near your area?" And lists like 5 names that I dont recognize. How is this even a question to verify identity.

Coin base has locked me out for 24 hours twice now. Once because it couldnt match my information against public records arbitrarily then the second time I had a 4 question questionaire that only gave me 4 minutes to complete which i didnt realize till too late and incurred another 24 hour wait, it's ridiculous

How am i supposed to get bitcoin in the first place without wiring my funds from my bank into an exchange or using local bitcoin?

Anyone dumb enough to believe this shouldn't be in cryptocurrency.
