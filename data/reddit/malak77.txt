The dollar is going to collapse. You can't just keep printing it year after year with nothing backing it.
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:23:58
And how do we know they didn't "hack" themselves?  ;-)
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:40:42
Ok, don't say I didn't warn you... holding is the only way to play. Maybe for 10 years if needed. USD is *way* more risk. Stocks and banks fail. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 10:20:58
PSA: DO *not* store coins online! If you want to buy or sell, then transfer them less than half a bitcoin at a time and do the transaction, then get them out of there. My coins are on removable USB hard drives and backed-up in multiple locations, but never attached to an online computer except to do a transaction. If these thefts keep happening, it is going to crush crypto. One of the best points of crypto to me is that you can have $50K in your pocket on a flash drive and no one is the wiser. It's only one small file(the wallet file) that you have to store elsewhere!
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:00:48
Don't worry what anyone thinks. Buy as much as you can and just hold.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:27:28
It will because there are a limited number. Whereas USD can be printed forever.

I ran my 4-8 7970s in the basement mostly during Winter so 45F typically down there.
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:54:27
I hope you did not scan the bills as that is enough to get you thrown in jail.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:24:57
Can you imagine if Satoshi did not HODL? Like bought pizzas with it all in 2010 or something?  
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:37:56
How so? Just reporting it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:38:26
Only worries are laws, regs, and quantum computing. 
Otherwise, we should have 2-5 years of growth left before any bubble worries.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:33:50
HODL! Hardly batting an eye at being down hundreds of thousands. It's par for the course with speculative investments.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:12:43


See where your username comes from.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:42:11
Yes, but the filed reports are analyzed and could trigger further investigation. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:57:29
Silver coins in a glass bowl. If the house catches on fire, the worst that will happen is you have a big glob of silver you can sell.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:38:02
Down from the high. Not from my entry point.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:24:48
Don't worry about it. Just HODL for as long as possible and sell when you can retire on it. If it never happens, then oh well. I am down 100s of thousands and not sweating at all. The huge number of stories of people who sold at $1K and below should teach you something. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:08:38
Maybe just credited to wrong account?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:41:13
I said 100s of....   ;-)
Newflash: there is not such thing as a safe investment. The stock market could crash at any moment. Your bank can even fail and take most of your savings, especially if you have more than the FDIC insured amount in one account, which no one should ever do. I invest in lots of shoot for the moon stuff and so far crypto is best performer.  
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:40:49
Probably more likely it was a old cache of the previous address.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:25:22
There's a chance that the feds are holding it up since ~$10K and above triggers a FINCEN report. I've been told by someone in DHS that they are actually tracking much lower amounts.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:06:12
It's been adopted by many companies already so not sure what you mean. It is a collector's item due to making history also. It's a way to transfer value to any person in the world. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:43:15
Yeah, they call me at work and ask me questions like what was my address 15 years ago and I'm like dude, I have *no* clue. Annoying AF.

A milkcrate worked well.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:40:34
The only thing you need to "protect" is the actual wallet file, which is tiny.
Downloading the whole blockchain takes tons of space. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:20:55
Not sure, because those came out after my heyday really. Maybe they are locked and/or encrypted devices?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:38:46
Nice try, OP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:44
Would you like fries with that?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:54:29
Stop using ponsi to describe it. In a ponsi scam all of the money does not actually exist to match the books. There is no doubt all the bitcoin exist and have value. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:17:15
pfff, could drop to zero and I would barely care. Anyone who has invested money they can't lose should not be in this, just like any investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:04:59
Send to a wallet on your own computer and then move the files to an external harddrive which you keep in a relatively secure place as shielded from the possibility of fire as much as possible. Online is never smart. I lost 5 BTC on Mt Gox and I only had the coins them there temporarily for trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:44:20
Only for weak people who invested what they could not afford to lose. Same with stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:23:34
Not when it comes to exchanging with other currency or buying goods.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:53:25
I missed the joke because what you said is technically true within a country. :-D
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:28:30
Not anymore, since we have to report it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:59:01
LOL, already been thinking they will need paypal records going way back already. Maybe this will dissuade them from auditing us grandfathered people.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:00:36
I will do your transaction for "one American dolla"
@_date: 2018-09-19 14:09:19
Hodl refers more to the concept of not selling too early. Of course you will eventually want to sell or there is no point. Generally it means to hold for years, not months/weeks/days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:13
Y'all are lightweights. My holdings went from $31K to like $5K years ago. Oh well...  Now look at it. This is why you HODL as long as possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:26:56
Wow, that's some difference. We are about to enter the new year...
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:42:38
Yep - paintings, cars, houses, gold, silver, etc
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:54
Yes, a hedge against the downfall of the USD
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:54
The thing I am annoyed at is that when the reporting requirement came out they want to know your cost basis and I mined them and rarely actually bought any. Luckily I did estimate out of curiosity that I spent a certain amount on equipment and electricity, so I guess I have to somehow spread that across all the coins. In 2013 there was no talk of this ever happening so no one kept records.

My Uni has only doubled since 1980.

How could there be a limit on the price of anything outside of a law limiting it? In between the fact that there will never be more than 21 mil of them and all the lost ones many think someday they could be a mil each. You know how rich people are... they will want some to be able to say they do at any price. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:13:10
Except all the relatives chatting it up during holiday get togethers could cause another boost...

Requires dropping acid first.

You can go the GBTC OTC route but normally requires actually calling the broker, which I hate. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:31:15
Myself also. The day it dropped to $800 within hours? lol
More proof that HODLers rule.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:17:29
Good point but would the IRS understand it? lol

I know, but some people are only comfy investing in ways already familiar to them. I have 95% of my holdings in an offline wallet.
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:30:36
Glad I never pursued it for that amount. I don't believe in keeping coins online, but got burnt by the timing and lost 5. Not a big deal in the overall picture though.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:20:00

You merely do not keep them there. These services are great for non-techies to get involved. The ETF should not be your main crypto holdings, but only a supplement.
@_date: 2018-08-01 17:05:20
I still can't believe that crypto moving 11% is even newsworthy. It used to change that much every day.

@_date: 2018-08-28 15:52:48
Bitcoin is merely one of their investments, but it was the closest thing I could find in the early days.
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:25:54
It is already.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:17:53
I'm talking about BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:18:56
Not true. There is a limited amount, so by definition it will go up in most cases. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:58:09
They are not drowning. You still have all your bitcoin. You have not lost or gained till you actually sell. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 13:53:10

It's not *all* negative. Now that it's viewed as legit, more investors are actually willing to buy now, but it obviously seems to contradict a huge part of the original purpose of being an underground currency that is off the radar.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:08:43
It could go back to $1.25 and I'm not selling crap. To the Moon or nowhere. This was meant to be a bust or broke investment from the start for me. If anything, I'll buy more! 
@_date: 2015-01-21 19:35:31
The fact that it is now a taxable item hurts it in the US. On the one hand, it legitimizes it as a store of value, but personally I *hate* doing taxes and it kinda stops me from doing more transactions till I actually sell. The worst part is that I did not know this was coming and could not even report it if I wanted to.  I have no log of every transaction ever done like with stocks. Especially since I dabbled in 25 or more different cryptos. It's kind of like Use Tax. Who the hell is going to keep a spreadsheet of everything they bought online. I don't have time for that...
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:53:04

@_date: 2019-03-07 22:40:43
Yeah, I meant for bank accounts and possibly credit cards. Had two mortgages with WF and they were fine.
Pretty sure it was BOA that was constantly calling me saying "Did you *really* order this?" YES I DID. Got to be exceedingly annoying. Switched to WF for the CC and they have been fine.

If you are young, HODL for retirement or an obvious huge gain and don't trade it for a pizza like the moron early adopters. lol
I got all mine from 2013-2014 and only got rid of one to trade for another coin. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:20:51
I don't think you are thinking this through. Time is money and it takes a good two weeks of research to understand crypto and that is not worth $5 or even $20. If you did this in addition to cash then good for you.
@_date: 2019-03-24 10:19:14
Or you just like to know how many thousands you made in the last hour.
@_date: 2019-03-20 15:31:52
A PUP just means Potentially Unwanted Program and usu not a big deal. Almost everyone has them on their PCs. I do delete them when malware scans run, but it is a relief if that is the worst result compared to coworkers who brought in their PCs and had 500 different very bad things on them. lol  I suggest using Malwarebytes Pro and not McAffee garbage. Been using it at work for a decade and never had a virus/malware spread over the network. They even stole my idea of renaming the scanner in case the malware deletes the executable. I suggested it and it was added within 3-6 months.
@_date: 2019-03-21 00:23:31
Like I would answer that...
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:08:52
Because so many only have under the table jobs.
@_date: 2019-03-24 09:11:12
Link? 
Maybe it has an unknown balance? You often can tell by the date of the file how likely they would have actually been mining and if so, how many bitcoins per day they would have been getting etc. I *still* kick myself that I saw my first article on bitcoin 3 or 4 years before I actually got into it. If I *had* looked into it then I would have been retired 5 years ago. I am still sitting pretty, but this would have been an order of magnitude better. 
I mean ultimately, it only needs ~1 bitcoin for them to break even, and odds are decent that it could be worth hundreds of thousands. So many morons mined when they were worth $50 and sold at $200 or $1000. It was always a retirement or bust thing thing for me and still is. 
@_date: 2019-03-19 20:24:10
Plus some people have generators even for home PCs, but banks may not.
@_date: 2019-11-30 05:44:20
Probably the latter.
@_date: 2019-03-21 00:32:37
I would not delete them if I "trusted" them. My record is flawless during my time and often tracked down the culprit myself before MWB. I looked for files less than 200 bytes* and dated recently. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:49:47
Unless you have free electricity.   ;-)
@_date: 2019-03-07 21:15:50
Less fees and denial BS.  The *only* fee I have ever paid was for bouncing a check and that is my fault so no problem with that at all.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:30:56
I need a license plate that says HODL someday...
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:18:01
Yes, I think something happened with them but I have been out of the loop for 4 years pretty much. So maybe bankruptcy court is your only option and may be too late. I'd try googling them. In the future, never allow an online site to hold your crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:29:36
Hypothetically, what if someone else in the house stored it there and obviously did not want it sold? Could they have a legal claim to get it back?
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:00:26
HODL till able to retire on it, baby.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:59:59


hodl, dude - gotta catch up with the latest crypto lingo
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:13:38
Never allow someone else to hold your crypto. You should physically have it in digital files with backups in other locations in case of fire/floods.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:48:28
So how do you avoid the feds tracking the money? You have to get the USDs somehow.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:57:14
Not really. Never sold any of mine, really. HODL!
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:46:10
So the cost of a ticket there and back is pretty expensive and then you have to trust they did not just give you something gold-plated.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:54:35
So probably at least 3500.   :-D
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:56:18
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:52:27
There's a chance that unformating it will allow recovery. You only need the wallet file and to remember the password of course.
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:00:33
What people never factor in with this argument is that what if the price of BTC rises significantly in the future.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:13:14
Agreed. I lost 5 (or $5K USD - I forget)  there but did not pursue it. Not worth my time for the % of it I would probably get. Funny thing is I have a policy of never keeping them online and the timing caught me just right.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:59:25


I like you.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:50:23
You know it!
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:40:53
You actually have to tell them about gold and BTC now. So I think I would sell them for something not tracked if wishing to avoid detection. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:23:38
And I thought my signature was bad...
Is this related to that attempt to make a law saying if you do not report your bitcoin to the feds, that they can seize ALL your assets? Did that ever pass?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:15:53
Really depends on the nature of the situation. Just a stockmarket failure is the tamest possible one. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:31:55
Ugh. Imagine a powered-up PC there with your wallet on it. Powered-off is bad enough.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:12:18
Try to login and use forgot my password like any other website.
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:21:29


Seriously? That was like 5 years ago. Way more ways to use now.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:10:37
Yeah, but then they will say how did you buy the gold. 
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:48:26
What kinda slacker only has 4 BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-03 20:28:07
Yeah, any major shifts and all over the news like "Bitcoin is crashing" lol  Lightweights....
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:25:33
Yes, but I heard they get processing fees.
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:42:07
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:51:42
How much do you make in fees running a node typically?
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:33:08
You are thinking too short-term. Trust me, someone will at least pump the price up again or it will naturally rise. 
@_date: 2019-02-09 09:24:27
Glad I can entertain! I'm here all week! 
Is it a native word or something?
@_date: 2019-02-05 15:19:43
Assuming he is not already.
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:57:06
The thing is when you see or hear HODL you know it is referring to cryptocurrency only. Hold could be anything at all. Plus that whole thread was great fun and made history. I am even in it. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:46:23
Figured there had to be a logical reason for such a strange name to English speakers.  :-D   Thanks.
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:50:29
Yeah, I was joking and would not do that, although I am at an age where I actually could honestly forget it.
@_date: 2019-02-26 13:17:45
It is a way to move money out of a country though. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:56:02
My passphrase escapes me, your Honor.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:38:10
Yes, likely to 10X at least if you can just hold it(HODL).
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:22:31
It was an analogy of celebration. They did not "call us" that. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:23:39
How do you know that chicken is not actually Satoshi?? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:30:29
There was English also. I just hate forms. Reminds me too much of tax time. lol
@_date: 2019-02-12 20:15:11
There is actually talk of *negative* interest rates from banks. Like WTF.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:44:54
You're learning, but HODL even longer.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:51:29
Sure. It's still fairly early on in the big picture. Wild ups and downs are par for the course. I have not sold crap since 2013.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:21:58
He has so much money, I think he dabbles in anything speculative. I have read he has tons of Iraqi dinar.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:14:27
@_date: 2019-02-05 14:56:47
Why in the world would he pick such a high number so soon? You know the big players will want to crash it back on the way up to make even more money. Plus, they will purposely prevent it from reaching a mil just to see what happens. $100K I can see, but a mil is really reaching.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:34
Curious did you do all the paperwork to try to get some back? I was too lazy for my 5 I had there mainly due to the price at the time. Not a biggie in the big picture for me though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:52:19
What insult?
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:36:29
Sounds like an acronym. lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:36:46
As far as I know, your only recourse is googling that address and possibly getting a hit that will show how to contact the person (like if they use it in a signature on a forum post). Of course, even then it requires them to be a nice person and send it back. 
It's best to visually confirm at least the first and last 3 characters after pasting. Lesson learned.
It's really no different than mailing cash to the wrong postal address. No one to blame but yourself. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 18:43:52
As time goes on more and and more places will accept it. Just buy directly with it from various sites. You can also buy gold and silver coins etc with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:12:19
It's really BS since the feds have recognized bitcoin as currency and you have to report it now.
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:23:03
Good, can you explain what Comox refers to?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:01:41
I believe that rule is only regarding selling over a certain $ amount. So safe for the seller to sell you a small amount. You can just use coinbase.com though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:25:03
All crypto used electricity to make it, so it is not "from nothing".
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:54:46
Instead of looking at the "rate" you should take the total dollar amount of the bill and divide by KWHs. It tends to double when you look at the real number.
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:00:11
Thanks for the site because my dropbox is full.
Edit: It has been 5 days and no reader has broken it yet. So not too shabby methinks.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:21:07
I hear what you are saying, but my orig point of not using a 3rd party app stands because the backdoor makes it useless.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:17:12
Many things to many people. :-D
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:50:39
ok, where do I send it?

Do most people despair over 10X?  ;-)
@_date: 2016-09-07 12:16:45
Actually is there a place to get it reviewed/tested? Been searching for years.
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:42:08
It doesn't have to be advanced. Remember, they will have no idea what algorithm you used if you delete the sourcecode securely or have the program  change the method according to the user inputs(which I did). 
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:46:47
Lots of forms of hidden USB drives. Jewelry etc.
@_date: 2018-03-07 11:57:04
*sick burn*
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:46:32
Are you saying it is nothing other than running the Core client with no special settings? I do that now and then to keep up with the trans. Is this a full node?
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:44:21
They need your passphrase and most people probably could not come up with it if being tortured. Heck, I question what mine is when I am calm half the time.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:40:17
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:24:58
Woo hoo! In the top 7%
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:47:57


Ok, I must have missed the memo on those, but followed BCH. How many of those do we have for each BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:37:42
Even the US does not allow you to take &gt;$10K out, right?
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:50:08
Also, are you saying the price for all 4 is $4200, or just the 3 forks? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:03:16
Oh well, but still better than just BTC
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:50:06
*Very* unlikely to be detected though. 
You can also merely rename the wallet.dat file and store it on dropbox or something.

Interesting how the fear of mining electricity usage may actually be spurring more development of alternative energy.  :-D
@_date: 2016-09-07 12:56:23
If you are so confident that I could not possibly have come up with a decent algo then PM me an email to send you a file so you can tell me what it says. I am not saying I *have* for sure. But I can be pretty good at outside the box thinking. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 15:28:45
Make your own encryption program and don't use 3rd party apps. If they have to invest time reverse engineering it, they may not bother and move on to the next easy target.

I don't know. Baby boomers are just starting to retire and personally I can't use a small screen if a larger screen is available. Also, many of us are gamers so PC Masterrace forever.
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:14:14
Seems odd considering an Aussie could be Satoshi. Also, I would think people from the days of DOS would be more likely to be in crypto because originally you needed to actually understand computers and not just install and run a program. I'm over 50 myself.
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:04:18
Wow! You just gave me an idea of a program that somehow encrypts into plaintext that makes sense therefore appearing to be not encrypted. Kind of like hiding info in photos.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:47:51
I was always told that women drivers merely caused the accidents.   :-D
Actually I did have one slowly drive right into me without braking and looking at me the whole time. Myself and the witness were like WTF?? But yes, overall I think women are better drivers due to generally being more careful. Not sure what the stats show.

@_date: 2018-02-06 16:30:02
So by your logic, I should have not have HODLed when my crypto holdings went from $31K to $6Kish in 2014? LMAO
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:54
I can't even register with Bitstamp because they say the resolution on my electric bill is not high enough. I downloaded it directly from the website, so it can't *get* any better. Ughhh.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:37:39
And what if it never dropped? Super risky to try to do that especially with all your hodlings.
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:05:48
Can you explain "per byte" more? I am from the old days when the fee was the same across the board...
How would I figure-out the number of bytes I am sending?
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:27:13
I was just wondering about this the other day, so thanks. I was on the forum at that time pretty much everyday.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:51:19
I know, right? Better sell before I totally forget. :-D
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:37:39
And what if it never dropped? Super risky to try to do that especially with all your hodlings.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:15:32
Ok, so maybe it was always per byte, and I just did not know it. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:14:38
You *do* know that you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin, right? lol

Was confused till realized you meant Chinese nationals.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:04:17
Depends how much data you encrypt though. You need a large amount of examples to reverse engineer it more speedily.

What do they mean by "print" Tether? I have not done crap since 2014.  :-D

Anyone know what % of losses the investors are getting? I never bothered to pursue it at the time because the price was so low.

Megacool. I have a ton of comments in the famous thread: 
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:18:52
You can stop it for the people that are law-abiding for sure. But that is less and less as time goes on. I see more people by the year that think stop signs don't apply to them.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:42:54
I can't even register with Bitstamp because they say the resolution on my electric bill is not high enough. I downloaded it directly from the website, so it can't *get* any better. Ughhh.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:48:30
This is why you spread your risk to other hard assets like real estate, gold and silver, precious gems, artwork, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:10:14
Oddly we don't seem to have those anymore except for strip clubs perhaps.
Oh, looked up the stats, and men are worse drivers. Almost 2:1

Only 50% recovered from previous high and it always blows thru the previous number. May have to wait a year, but worth it.

Proud to say I am in that thread and a part of history! :-D
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:00:28
Sorry, but the vast majority of mine were mined. Matter of fact, instead of using an electric heater in one room this Winter, I will be mining again.
The price is going up because of more demand and a limited supply. This is just basic economics. 
To me a huge plus is being able to move money out of the country if the shit hits the fan. You can either have if all on a flashdrive or merely temporarily uploaded till you get to your new country. I've hardly spent any % wise.

If it hits $10K, you can be sure they will make Coinbase report it.

This is "worse" because even crypto requires a lot of hard computing and electricity to make more.

What do you mean out of nowhere? It was sent from another address.
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:12:30
Don't forget when you convert BTC to USD on places like Coinbase, they get tax money from that, so they are likely to let it ride as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:42:35
Totally agree. HODL to the MOONNNN
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:32:28
HODL to the MOON would be a good shirt.

Yah. Bitcoin: "It's worth the wait."

So much idiocy in all his crypto comments in the link. He seems to be unaware that there are passwords on the wallets stored offline in someone's head and extremely difficult to hack.

In person, you would have to be in a larger city with vendors that accept it or that have BTC ATM machines, but online you can purchase with it from *many* places.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:04:53
Bitcoin lesson for the newbies... at one point in 2013 or 2014 I had $33K worth and it dropped to something like $8K. Did I sell? NO. If I had and never got back in then I would not have 6 digits worth now. You HODL till you can retire early. Selling on the way up is fine, but don't sell the majority till we hit at least $60K each.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:55:28
external harddrive only connected during transactions or block updates is the only way to be safer
still have to worry about fire and theft, but you can keep just the wallet file at a 2nd location

It's too early for general adoption. Look at the curve for cell phone use or any other huge emerging tech, in it's early days. Crypto is mirroring this curve.

A license plate with HODL is much more meaningful than one that says HOLD. HOLD could apply to anything.

I remember reading an article about a bitcoin ATM in some Scandinavian country probably between 2009-2011 and should have looked into it more then as I would be retired if I had. But I am happy with getting in during 2013 at least.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:41:21
It will continue to do the up down for years probably. Just buy and hold and maybe you can retire early.

@_date: 2018-04-09 17:30:17
Yeah, I was pissed that they wanted to know the value on the day you got them and the thing is I never tracked how many I got each day and forget logins to mining sites from 2014. My CPA basically said claim nothing till you eventually sell and then zero cost basis which is fine with me just to keep it simple. It's very unfair to expect people to be psychic before the law passed and to have kept records of everything.
@_date: 2018-07-30 17:25:42
Yes, inflation would imply that more coins are needed over time to get one burger.
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:12:59
I do think this is fraud because crypto is confusing enough for newbs, so don't add to it! Ugh.

Just download them to an external drive or USB stick and never have it plugged in when not transacting.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:32:08
No, it's an all or nothing thing for me. If I cannot retire early then I will just ride it out. I was going to start selling some at $10K but def not all of it. If it goes to negative(i.e. a loss) then oh well. I don't invest what I cannot totally loose. Investing is just moonshots for me.

@_date: 2017-06-20 15:12:34
You need a wallet program for each, but just make subdirectories. It is a pain to learn everything at first, but worth it since only the physical location of the drive catching on fire will destroy the coins and you can even guard against that by leaving a copy somewhere else. 
No printable version at all. Send to the address of your wallet and done. Make sure to create a PW/key.
