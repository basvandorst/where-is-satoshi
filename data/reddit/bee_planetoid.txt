The whole analogy makes bitcoin seem like a stadium, and the miners are ticket sellers. They want to sell every seat to one rich guy and be done, rather than let people buy seats, and risk not getting as much, completely ignoring the public utility.
I don't think that is quite right, I think most miners are at least partially rational, and partially altruistic.

If you plan on relaying 2x blocks we are strictly not peers.  Its not that I don't agree with you how it should be upgraded (way to move the Overton window, I fucking see you.) Its that I do not agree that this is an upgrade, it would severely degrade the usefulness of bitcoin *over the long haul*.

I'm a Bitcoin Maximalist, so afaIc this wave of ICO removal is a good thing. Bitcoin has a ways to go before it is cemented as the currency of the internet, and more competition doesn't help.

No see, here's where that narrative falls apart: If the main chain stagnates and transactions permanently come to a halt there will be no 'ignore the S2X chain' because it is their intent for it to become the only active chain.  This isn't a friendly competition where you get to pick your side, they are coming full speed to force you onto their side even if you hate their guts.

There was a guy I knew, I offered to subsidize him buying a bitcoin and he could pay me back when he sells (essentially no loss possible for him) at $120 right before the runup to $1200 the first time. He said no. 
Soon after we had a falling out (asked me to get him CP on Tor). Yet he knows how many bitcoins I had (have), and I bet everytime for the rest of his life when he sees bitcoin in media he will first feel regret then anger. He will probably hate me until he dies.
Mixed bag there, I wish I could get along with everyone, but I can't pull it off :(

I just found out BitPremier shut down :(

I think you nailed it three times lol.

Equal number of, or equal value of? Or both (0)?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:18:04
If that is true, then its unreasonable to expect much of a retraction before the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:46:36
I fucking hate this piece of shit. Was bad-mouthing bitcoin so recently.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:48:58


Third option: the price increases to the point that the same amount of bitcoin or less could be used as the fee. If 0,0775BTC was worth $34500 instead of $345 it would be able to support much more of the mining overhead with the same sat/byte ratio. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:52:39
Nice blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:00:31
I disagree with all of that. The forks are malicious, and there are already plenty of altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:19:02
What about all the people buying Bitcoin so that they will own both forks?
@_date: 2017-10-05 10:44:53
It did though

Thankfully samourai wallet let's you do fees of any size, Even if it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:47:29
What you did there.... patent that method.

Well I think so, check out whats left of the site.

[I was thinking about this today]( What an irritating and disingenuous media we have!  
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:56:39
You do realize that Bitcoin was intended to ultimately run exclusively on transaction fees, right?
@_date: 2015-11-04 08:34:37
I know what you mean, on many levels. Kap khun kha. (I don't care that this is 'misgendered')

Nah that's a shit analogy
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:38:21
The other 10% is being held because it looks nice.
@_date: 2017-05-07 14:48:36
I'd make a bet with you, but you're probably right.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:02:30
Any post claiming it was dead is a true false flag. An advanced psyop tactic. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:55:20
Well, lets hope he pulls his initial. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:14:27
Well, I think the most ethical move is not to go for proof of stake at all, avoid the issue of paying people to hold your currency with money from thin air (I may not know how this works). Its like a tax on all the other potential users of the system. 
Besides, what it means to be ethical is debatable, if you think you are doing good, there may be someone who disagrees. The original question probably was meant in the line of "Is it fair to pay the rich more than the poor for holding the money? is it fair to pay people for that at all?"
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:24:21
Edit: Apparently not, but I wanted to know too, so I ventured a guess.

No joke tho. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:31:12
If you say so. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:31:10
What I'm saying is that because of the fees, the price is suppressed. I may be wrong, but that is the heart of what I am saying. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:40:40
Its way too late to not pitch bitcoin to everyone I know. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:44:02

@_date: 2017-05-18 17:53:58
Thats assuming he isn't selling at all
@_date: 2015-11-07 10:24:31
Well I agree with that guy because its the only technical problem Bitcoin faces that I'm scared by because it is economically charged more so than any other, leading to perverse incentives. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 05:54:15
Its like clockwork... You know, how it rhymes.

You can read the entire Bitcoin code. It's published.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:13:46
Yeah, that fee is enough to transfer through time, but not the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:36:26
He can't be accumulating BTC as much as possible, and also selling. If he can cover his maintenance costs without selling BTC then I kinda buy your theory, but if he has to sell to cover electricity, he would be better off with no fees and a doubled price. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:45:39
Right well fuck you asshole.

@_date: 2017-05-29 02:57:11
Right well, what was your fee then?
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:38:52
Right well I think I do.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:37:33
It is though. If you just held Bitcoin since basically any point in the past, you did well.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:09:32
Its not the closed source that bothers me, its that the header gets reused.

Everyone but the miner.
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:55:10
That does not really speak to the ethics of it, I was just pointing out the same about the previous comment. I'm not sure if it is ethical, but I also don't really care.

You're naïve to say the least.

They might have been laundering money, but to the public they have always claimed that they were hacked.
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:15:46
One of the things that could go wrong is the difficulty becomes so high that it is no longer feasible to split off. If we can't mine new blocks there will never be a re-targeting, transactions on our fork will stall. The manufacturers and mine owners control enough hash power now and the difficulty has become so high that without a big chunk of what you may call a special interest coming with us we could never match their hash power (which they could attack our network with as well) because they have such a massive head start.

They actually legitimately have gone insane. They have everything backwards. E.g asicboost is good, and antbleed was (somehow) a typo by the dev.
