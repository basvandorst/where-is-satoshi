Are there any hardware wallets that store more than just bitcoin?

I talked about Bitcoin to my coworker two weeks ago and now the entire office is talking about it and having discussions. Gotta love it.

Ha, I see 20k by the end of the week.

I personally use Mycelium, but Bread is pretty good also.

I dont buy anything thru mycelium, all i use it for is a wallet to store my coin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:12:34
Fucking wut?

What is up with Gdax today? The numbers are all over the place, Almost 20k then drop to 15k now it gets to 17k and drops right back to 15k. This is a strange rollercoaster ride.

You would think a major site like them would be able to scale by now with how many times this has happened, not like this is new.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:45
I don't know the fees for that, all i do is transfer from coinbase to mycelium, haven't done any transferring from mycelium to another wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:59
And that number just keeps going up

Just do what I did, get your boss into bitcoin also and now both of you can slack off.

Even if I wasn't able to put a lot into Bitcoin i'm still excited to be here watching everything unfold.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:09:16
As someone new to this coinbase was the fast and esasy step into the world of bitcoin for me. So now that I'm here what is suggested the best thing to do.

Dont think it will change their minds, I've been showing my parents for the last couple years how bitcoin keeps going up and up and up but the only response I get from them is "It's not REAL money" my parents are ignorant about this even if the proof is right in front of them.

My wife watches Grey's Anatomy and the hospital got "Hacked" and they asked for payment in bitcoin, it was surprising to hear.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:07:27
I'm currently new to this as well, but i'm jumping in and seeing what happens. I'm tired of sitting back looking at the "What ifs".
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:28:15
Most people who do that kind of trading most likely used a different platform though. At least I would if I was make that much money from bitcoin.

This site hurts me in more ways than I thought possible. Good job.
