The main reason Bitcoin jumped to the ATH of \~20k was because Bitcoin's exposure to the world peaked. I remembered my non-tech savvy coworkers and family members talking about it and considering buying some.
The main reason it dropped rapidly is because people realized the technology itself was not worth that much at the time.
It is currently hovering around 6-8k only because of the few who are still consistently investing a portion of their paychecks. Based on how much time has passed since then, I believe more people are getting out of Bitcoin rather then jumping in as new investors.
If Bitcoin can ever surpass its ATH of \~20k, it would be the real deal. In my opinion, that would be a good indication to seriously invest in Bitcoin even if it immediately drops hard below \~20k afterwards due to whatever reasons. Thoughts?
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:58:05
I am asking a legit genuine question. If this is how you treat someone new who might consider converting over to Bitcoin, then good luck.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:03:30
You do realize that if Bitcoin prevails over fiat, mutual funds will start trading in Bitcoin instead of fiat right? Same goes for real estate, gold, etc. Investments can be traded for whatever currency prevails in the future.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:46:37
I don't see Bitcoin ever failing, it's the question of will it perform at least as well as a mutual fund? We are talking about a small piece of many companies that generate revenue vs a virtual currency.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:31:13
I have definitely considered those possibilities, but I think if crypto prevails over fiat, wouldn't people just trade stocks/real estate with crypto instead of fiat? It's not like I have most of my wealth in cash or in the bank.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:54:49
A guarantee of still being around centuries later? Sure.
A guarantee of performing at least as well as the average mutual fund 40 years later? I would not say so.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:38:46
I think you are looking at short term. For long term investing and for leaving something behind for your children and grandchildren, a 5-10% ROI should suffice if you are consistent with your investments.
An example is my uncle. Came over as an immigrant in his late 20's without knowing English and cleaned windows at min wage. He learned about investing. Now he's almost retired as a multi-millionaire and he still has a near min wage job. He can retire anytime but he likes his work. He always advised on investing in mutual funds as the easy way to become a millionaire.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:16:57
Pretty much any with a large variety of stocks and low admin fees. The trick is to consistently invest and give it enough time for compound return to kick in. This has been going on since the 1920's.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:52:15
But most people **are here** to get rich quick. Otherwise they would have made the more logical choice to invest in a 401k, IRA, or some mutual fund.
Downvote all you want, but it is the truth.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:56:01
I still am. Just poking around this subreddit to see why people are actually choosing Bitcoin over a mutual fund as a long term investment. If I find the reasons to be good enough, I am open minded enough to convert.

So according to Mcafee's bet, what should the price of bitcoin be around now?

You can easily google some examples. The one I'm in right now is closed off to new investors because they wanted to focus more on the investing rather than the ever growing customer service.
@_date: 2018-08-11 03:51:36
Simply because of the power of compound return cannot be overstated over the long term. I assume you understand that even 1% makes a huge difference. This is why I am trying to understand why some people genuinely choose Bitcoin for their long term investing whether it's all in or just a percent.
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:39:10
So it's the early of early days when we are talking about Bitcoin's untapped potential. But when we praise the durability of Bitcoin and how it has endured constant attacks for over a decade, then it has withstood the test of time and been around forever.

You have misunderstood me. I am here to experience this from a financial perspective, not that of a developer's. And Newton would probably be more interested in solving more important unsolved problems like P versus NP or even Collatz Conjecture (which I am currently working on).

Like I stated, that was an estimate. I even stated in my original post that I can be wrong. No need to get all riled up.
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:29:04
You put it in a very negative way but that is what the word "opinion" means and that is what I have been saying from the very beginning.
I don't know why you are so hostile for no good reason. You are seeing red and have trouble with comprehending my post. Hope you didn't invest too much into it.
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:06:30
First of all, Bitcoin is not the only global currency the world has.
Secondly, there are already objectively better alternatives to Bitcoin in the other cryptocurrencies.
Finally, I never stated that I have the "final solution" to Bitcoin. I never started investing my time to working towards one because I believe Bitcoin to ultimately fail in the end. The white papers tell me enough. I am here to experience this bubble. Even if I am wrong, I will still have gained a valuable experience without losing a single dollar.
No need to be hostile just because your investment took a dip.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:22:09
That estimate just comes from looking at the price history and assuming a bubble never started.
Also the fact that it has already hit mainstream news and has then been declining from 19.7k supports my estimate.
What is interesting is that you only question those with lower estimates and not those with higher estimates like Bitcoin hitting 6 digits in a few years despite crash.
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:46:20
Now you're just putting words in my mouth. I said I had a mathematical background so I was able to understand the white papers and analyzed the algorithms for myself instead of blindly following the hype and lambo memes.
I reread my original post and nowhere did I say I had used a mathematical method or formulas to come up with that $500. I even implied that I could be wrong about my estimate and would completely be fine with that.
The fact that you interpret my original post in such a different way tells me that you are either somewhat riled up or that English is not your strongest language, no offense intended.
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:47:31
Before knowing anything about Bitcoin, I decided to read the white papers to see what the hype was about and to see if I should invest in it. I even worked through the algorithms from the beginning to the end to maximize my understanding. I ultimately concluded that this technology can easily be duplicated in much better ways and that the current price at the time most likely implied Bitcoin to be a bubble.
Before you ask, yes I do have a solid mathematics background.
I believe Bitcoin's true value to be under $500 based on its current capabilities and adoption.
Why am I here then? This is still an interesting case study. Even if I am wrong and Bitcoin spikes up to 1mil, I will have learned a valuable financially risk-free lesson as a relatively young person by following this technology.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:25:06
1.) Facebook was a better duplicate of the social media's preceding it like ConnectU and Myspace.
2.) Facebook has already been widely adopted unlike Bitcoin.
If there is a cryptocurrency that will be widely adopted, I highly doubt it will be Bitcoin. It's been on mainstream media and has been going downhill since then.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:34:32
Well I posted this in another thread:

@_date: 2018-06-25 05:01:14
In this case, I defined true value as the value that person A and person B agree to exchange Bitcoin and fiat assuming this never became a bubble in the first place.
You don't need a mathematics background to see that the price increases for the most part came from blind greed and lambo memes rather than from the actual advances and adoption in this technology. It is currently extremely overvalued.
And that $500 was obviously a conservative estimate. It was me being generous. It should be even lower. Sorry I didn't clarify that I estimated it. Should be obvious enough.
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:07:47
Of course you are free to disregard my opinion with or without the merit. You probably disregarded all the award winning economists too not to mention Bill Gates and Warren Buffet:


@_date: 2018-06-25 23:20:39
I mean it went down from 19.7k to 6k over half a year. You don't need any sort of insight or wisdom to see that this implies it is not perfect, hence it is flawed.
After reading the white papers, my intuition tells me the very concept of it is flawed. I believe even the greatest minds in this world would not be able to fix this so I chose not to invest. Of course this is just my opinion, I could be wrong, and Bitcoin can jump up to 1mil in the future. I only stated that I have a mathematics background just to have some merit in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:46:37
Back in Dec'17 when Bitcoin reached its ATH, an older coworker of mine ask me if it was worth investing in. I'm so glad I told her it was most likely a bubble and that most people jumped in hoping to get rich quick with no effort. She was not tech savvy at all and was saving up for her kid's college education.
I feel bad for those who managed to convince others to jump onto the bandwagon.
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:10:30
Yes. Just look and think about your premise. The fact that there is a large number of "lost forever" bitcoins is in itself a problem. How do you think it came to be?
No one thinks it will happen to them, until it does.
The security of Bitcoin is both a strength and weakness. 
Ex: What happens if your fiat gets robbed from a bank account in the US? It gets insured by the FDIC up to 250k. Your credit info got stolen? Fraud protection. 
What happens if your crypto gets hacked from an exchange or your wallet? Your crypto is gone forever and everyone tells you to be more tech savvy.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:27:20
Wow I was gonna ask what price Bitcoin would be at if this turns out to be a pump and dump and it had already happened LOL.

Wow so convincing. I guess I will stop trusting banks and go all into crypto. Let's hope the founder isn't the only one with the password to the cold storage holding around $190m. And let's hope that he does not mysteriously "die" while on a trip to India.
Yeah no. I think I still trust banks more than crypto exchanges. Very few fiat are in a hyperinflation scenario.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:44:37
The great bitcoin adoption cycle and why it will never completely succeed:
=&gt; Bitcoin has a limited supply (Most of you will agree with this)
=&gt; Bitcoin price on average will increase over time due to lost bitcoins (Most of you will agree with this)
=&gt; Vendors start adopting Bitcoin for payments (This has happened)
=&gt; Since Bitcoin price is constantly increasing against fiat, the value of the service/product that is being sold will be more expensive if purchased in Bitcoin than fiat for a brief period of time until the vendor can update the Bitcoin rates. There will always be a delay in this due to pricing algorithms, latency, hardware limitations, etc. (This is just logic resulting from the previous statements. Please think carefully about this)
=&gt; Most consumers will prefer to use fiat more than Bitcoin for payments for the mentioned service/product because it is cheaper to do so. (This is just logic resulting from the previous statements)
=&gt; Vendors start dropping Bitcoin as payments since it is no longer worth it (see Steam as an example)
=&gt; And the cycle repeats again since Bitcoin price on average is supposed to increase over time. 
Now for the finisher:
If Bitcoin price is always supposed to increase over time against fiat, this means consumers should logically prefer to use fiat more than Bitcoin for payment on services/products that are offered for both Bitcoin and fiat. 
If you disagree with any of the statements above, please feel free to analyze it carefully then let me know.

@_date: 2018-11-26 03:27:07
I am not sure why you would include the USD as part of this. It's more like Bitcoin vs gold. 
Bitcoin as a nonadjustable currency would be extremely bad for the economy. What is usually not mentioned in analysis like this is that the Fed also remove money to counter too much inflation. Having a little inflation is good for the economy as it discourages hoarding (like Bitcoin hodlers), allow for businesses to acquire loans, and overall just keeps the economy growing. This can be seen for the past few centuries.
The only people who can benefit from Bitcoin being the main currency are the type who keep their net worth in cash for decades... which is just a horrible idea. Only in that situation would I agree Bitcoin is better than the USD for that individual. The economy would still go to shit though if that happens. Bitcoin can only replace gold.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:38:17
You would use John "I pay women to shit in my mouth" McAfee as an authority but disregard people like Buffet and Gates.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:27:24
You are looking at how much "an individual can earn" instead of how many actually lost vs profited throughout the lifetime of Bitcoin. I will bet anything more people lost than profited as of today. Those who profited are very lucky to have bought some early, and they profited a shitload thanks to a much larger number of people who buy in later "inheriting their bags".
Sure I agree that 90% of the time Bitcoin has existed, it has given huge gains. But it gave huge gains to most likely less than 10% of the current total number of Bitcoin investors.

@_date: 2018-11-17 18:13:43
which statement are you referring to? both of what i posted about are true.
it is definitely possible to increase the supply limit by implementing it in the code and convincing the majority of the community to adopt it. it would be a fork and that fork would be the new bitcoin if the majority uses it.
it is also true that most of this growth happens within the last 1-2 years out of the decade. this kind of irregular growth points to it being a bubble, and the fact that it dropped almost 75% from it's peak within the year is supporting the claim that it is a bubble.
everything i post is backed by fact and good reasoning. why don't you put some more effort into your post as this is a discussion thread?
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:31:28


This same logic can be applied as follow:
"With bitcoin however, the thing you are getting for 400,000x of its 2009 price now is exactly what you were getting in 2009."
Bitcoin's value is entirely dependent on how many are willing to buy it in the future. It has already hit mainstream news at this point and pretty much everyone has heard of it (at least from my perspective).
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:24:52
This is why fiat will win.
At least with fiat, we do have the government backing it up in some ways. Despite what reddit may say, people do go to jail because of the IRS and other regulators.
With the unregulated cryptomarket, there will be the few elites who will be able to do as they please with absolutely no consequences.
Look at several MMO's economies with minimum dev's intervention as an example. In every one of those, there are a few elites who totally has control of the market. They manipulate the market to their benefit and get even "wealthier" than those who manipulate fiat. 
It will be the same with crypto.
Just like how every society needs a government to keep order, currencies also need an authority to keep it from being manipulated with no opposition.

@_date: 2018-11-17 08:59:43


a quick google search shows this statement to be false as it is possible to increase the supply by implementing it in the code and convincing the majority of the community to adopt.
even if that statement is true, it wouldn't matter if you are one of like ten people who owns bitcoin in the future.


there are many speculative bubbles/ponzi schemes that follow this trend. if you actually zoom out on the chart, most of the growth happens in the last 1-2 years when this thing started a decade ago. this is not normal at all and points to it being a bubble. the only reason im not shorting the fuck out of this is because im doing well enough to not even have to bother with it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:44:13
The only traders that are "waiting to take it from you cheap" are those blinded by greed.

The true value of bitcoin should not be higher than 1k. It is only this high because almost everyone who bought in the past year are just hoping to get rich quick rather than genuinely believing in the technology.
For anyone who disagrees with my previous statement, consider this:

This is where we seriously need to define the word fail. If you define fail as Bitcoin hitting a flat 0, then I would agree with your points. That is almost impossible with how Bitcoin works!
If you define fail as Bitcoin's price forever being below a particular exchange value moving forward, then that is a whole nother story (i.e. sub 1 Bitcoin : $4,000 USD forever).
If you define fail the latter way, I would disagree with your post simply based on the point that the very strong cryptography of Bitcoin can also mean no way of recovering it if you simply lose your key in some accident or if it gets stolen. Once it's gone, it is gone forever since it is not backed by the government or insured by any third party. That alone is just huge, especially if most of your net worth is in Bitcoin. You **need** to be tech savvy to live in a world where Bitcoin is used as the main currency, or you will get exploited or hacked by the numerous cyber thieves out there. To live in a world where Bitcoin is used as the main currency is to live in a constant paranoia state of fear, having to constantly watch out for yourself because no one else can really be trusted with the key(s) to your life savings.

And the true reason why you're posting this is not to help others but yourself. The value of Bitcoin mostly depends on people like you who invested their entire life savings into it, so you need more people to jump in to increase your net worth.
That is the only reason why it became a bubble in the first place. And now I'm sure some unfortunate souls are gonna go all in due to this post in hope of becoming rich by doing almost nothing.
And really? Companies spending 100m+ to develop new ASICS for Bitcoin? Lmao. I know you don't want to link your real account but you can surely at least provide a source for that? I would love to read up on it.
