Same here!

I disagree. Bitcoin itself has no value and is not even tangible. I think Bitcoin is going to succeed mainly as a super efficient payment method. At the same time it could be used as a currency, but not necessarily competing with fiat currencies.

Bitcoin. The Next Step.

Well, I think it is actually a smart move! Due to the low price, a lot of interested buyers will show up and he can sell *the same data* to each buyer. In the end of the day, (s)he may get a larger amount this way :)

I'm not able to give you ideas, but I think you should come up with something memorable: can be a vision of the future, an example of application that would revolutionize the way we live or something like that, so they will remember the talk after and maybe try to investigate more and deep in this issue.

btw, here it goes my contribution (it's my first tip! actually, it is the first time I'm spending some BTC ever!!)
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:36:47
Same here.
Let's say I'm "loading" my exchanger's wallets right now :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:06:17
Well... It's not that fast, right?
I mean, there are instantaneous payment methods in the market, therefore I think that won't be one of Bitcoin's advantages at all.
@_date: 2014-03-28 14:42:59
The second paragraph is of great importance too!
About the first, it just lacks the source :s

So, here we have our slogan guys! x) (  )
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:33:08
Hey folks! I was inspired by this gesture, so I did something similar :)
Here you go: 
It is in Portuguese, as most of my facebook friends are portuguese. I did a small change, I'm giving more BTC to the first one to apply, then the second, and so on ($9,$5,$3,$2 and $1) and I'm recommending electrum as a wallet.
In case anyone wants to contribute to the "pool prize", be my guest (I have a ChangeTip account or you can also pass by  )
To the moon :D

Indeed. For me is already a considerable amount of money though. (I have to say I'm a student)

I actually like: "Bitcoin, be your bank"

I wonder if Satoshi is reading all this stuff right now and LOL xD
I can imagine him thinking *these guys have plenty of good ideas for what to do with my money, let me write down this one!* ahah

Great initiative!
I was most surprised by the amount of "millionaires" over here :) 50+ is a lot of BTC!
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:07:55
Well, they still have to follow a script/procedure and fulfill some requisites, I guess?! :)

You've made a very good point.

Don't take me wrong here, I've absolutely nothing against China or Chinese people. I actually was born in China!
What I meant is that, generally speaking, the US does not trust China. China is seen by the US more as a threat or a competitor than as an ally, right? And definitely not as an US-puppet!
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:22:47
Would you care to elaborate why is it rational? :)
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:05:03
I understand what you're saying, but do you really think that tax revenues are a strong incentive to SEC?
I'm pretty much unaware of how it works there in the US, but is SEC collecting taxes itself? Otherwise, that wouldn't be that strong of an incentive, would it?


Could you please elaborate on this a bit? Any guess on what could prevent this to be approved?
@_date: 2017-03-03 10:20:37
Thanks  and 
I just noticed I have another transaction still awaiting to be confirmed (also sent from Electrum):
I guess Electrum is not calculating the fees correctly, is it?
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:17:59
Well, I do not personally think bitcoin is dangerous. I mean, I regard it as a technological innovation and a very interesting social experiment. I hold bitcoins since long time ago.
I understand COIN will give people the option to invest in Bitcoin (though I don't get quite well how that would be better than buying bitcoin directly!), but hey, regulators and bureaucracy exist for a reason after all, which is to avoid fraud and ruinous investment decisions from badly-informed people, as well as to punish infractors.
But maybe you're right to say that, if there's nothing wrong about it, then SEC should just allow the average Joe to invest in it.
I'm not a native english speaker btw, so I might be using words a bit out of context.
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:32:43
It seems I was right to think that all this hype about the SEC approval was a bit irrational :\

Do you know if w/u or other services alike require ID check-up to release the cash? I've never use it before.

Thanks for sharing this!
@_date: 2016-12-22 23:16:47
I believe the author is arguing that Bitcoin (or any digital token based on a distributed ledger for that matter) "wastes" storage because the blockchain/ledged is replicated across all nodes. So, its not even about the size of the blockchain, is about the number of redundant copies all around internet.
The author also mentions the high energy intensity/consumption requirements when addressing the Bitcoin scalability issue. Anyway, the energy consumption is related to the mining process (i.e. proof of work) and not to the basic concepts of digital token and blockchain.
I think I understand the author's viewpoint and I tend to agree.
@_date: 2016-11-09 14:29:28
Yeah, that's exactly what I thought...

Kraken now accepts wire transfers. Their bank account is in Germany.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:27:51
Great response! It puts some clarification on this.
So what happens if, at some point, the economic majority does support the faction of miners who oppose SegWit? In that scenario, will the balances in all SegWit addresses become exposed to theft?
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:02:23
While I thank you for pointing out those articles (which I've came across already), that doesn't seem the kind of response I'm looking for.
Those articles approach the question from a technical point of view. What I want to know is: what does a bitcoin user (that send and receive btc) should know before adopting SegWit addresses.
For example, is there any risk of losing funds for using SegWit addresses? If so, in which scenarios would that happen?
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:34:32
I'm deviating from the subject here, but am I right to conclude that a hard-fork would be safer than this way of soft-forking? Wouldn't it avoid this mess?
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:25:33
So, first, *what* does mean economic majority? Is it the most number of nodes? Is it the most hashing power? Is it the most number of addresses? Is it the most number of btc controlled?
Back to your thesis, I believe there is a paradox in your rationale:
* Let the economic majority be the people who owns more btc
* Imagine a scenario where the economic majority does oppose SegWit and so they take effective action to block it and any funds in SegWit addresses become vulnerable
* You state the value of btc would crash as a consequence
* Therefore the economic majority is hurting itself and thus it makes no sense for them to act like this
But note that for a crash to occur, that means a strong imbalance between supply and demand. I mean, a crash is the result of an excess of supply/shortage of demand.
However,  the hypothetical scenario we defined implies the economic majority is engaged in blocking SegWit. Therefore, why would the economic majority then start selling btc?
Actually, I'd expect the price to increase because the economic majority would be happily buying btc in view of what they see as an improvement to the protocol.
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:24:16
OK. You convinced me.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:04:01
This is exactly the type of response I'm looking for.
So, is it really a no brainer decision for the user? Does anyone here disagrees?
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:44:23
Hi mate.
I might be able to help you on that. Please check your inbox.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:03:47
Says who?
Why do you think it is not possible to sell 1MUSD of BTC or more?
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:36:57
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:27:24
Bitcoin allows (and actually was designed for) peer to peer transactions.
No need to use an exchange, just find a buyer.. and believe me, they are everywhere..
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:15:10
How easy it is to go over the counter is highly debatable, I mean, probably easier and much faster than getting the top-tier verification at a major exchange needed to sell such an amount.
It might be so easy that buyers will simply come to you once you state you want to sell 1MUSD worth of bitcoin. You'd just need to wait for them to contact you. You know what, if you or anybody else wants to sell such an amount.. just pm me. There you go. Could it be any easier than this?
Anyways, my point is that *it is possible to sell a million dollars of bitcoin or (much) more indeed.*
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:04:00


So your proposal for an *innovative symbol* is...?
Never mind, you haven't presented any better alternative (any alternative at all).
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:05:36
As far as I know, there isn't.
I posted this to share the news with fellow redditor-bitcoiners after receiving a newsletter from ANX.
Maybe I should have thought better if this message was indeed aligned with this sub mindset.
