Fortunately we only keep our hot-wallet topped up so high. So successful hacks like this can never drain the casino of it's BTC

Unsimilar to Bitcoin: As far as I know you don't instantly die when you run out of coins.

I was kicking myself when I bought at $22 and missed out on $11....

How long will my sponsor logo be on your pages with the $250 tier?

Interesting. It's not liking my css files very much! Even the base bootstrap.css. Looking into this now. Thanks for the pics
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:27:02
Why thankyou! I will keep this on hand until I see a comment worthy of passing it on to :)
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:29:22
Unsure why this is happening. Funnily enough if you visit via  instead of .net there is no issues.
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:28:44
Valid points. Happy to hear all feedback and change the systems if need be. CPC was shot down instantly.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:35:04
100% fine. No need to worry :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:07:01
No problem. I do apologize about it taking 2 days. I agree this is much too long. I will be writing a new script to do manual checks every 30 mins or so when blockchain.info is down.

Would love to work with the community to create all the features you would want as an advertiser or publisher. You can also find out a little more information here:

Sorry about this. I am doing some crazy edits right now moving over to the new cost-per-hour system. I'll fix you up.
@_date: 2013-08-04 14:52:59
Yeah it should be fixed now hopefully. EDIT: Still may be having some troubles. Try going through  if you have problems instead of .net.
@_date: 2013-08-04 16:24:08
What would you suggest? Do you prefer CPC?
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:03:47
Was having web server issues. Resolved now for the .net domain.

All poker tables are play-money at the moment for testing. You cannot wager real BTC on them right now. You can however wager real BTC on all the other games in the casino.
Also be warned there is massive bugs in Poker atm due to having to force the update out. Most games don't even get past the big blind. I will have this fixed asap.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:03:49
It's online now :)
@_date: 2013-09-08 15:37:52
Damn it!
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:38:26
This is not true. If you flip a coin 10 times and it lands heads 8 times. You have 80% heads. Now do it 1000 times and you get 508 heads and 492 tails. It is now almost 50/50 but still 8 more heads than tails. It could do this without tails coming positive over heads.

Normally I would agree but in this case I do not care even if the website creator posted this. Send him tips! It's well deserved
@_date: 2013-09-08 16:28:02
All clicks must come from a unique IP and have the referrer of the website with the adspace on it. This isn't fool proof but it does stop a wide variety of fraudulent clicks/views. In the end adspace is purchased by time, so while faking your views and clicks will make your site appear more active, it is still up to the advertiser how much they pay.
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:08:57
You can actually pick which hours you want your ad to be active under 'more options' when you place your bid! So this should solve that issue :)
@_date: 2013-09-09 04:38:57
Actually the ad is served in a HTTPS iFrame loaded from bitads.net and the link is also directed to bitads.net before redirecting to the destination. Thus it is always HTTPS and should be counted.  We are still in beta though so this may require some more adjustments
@_date: 2013-09-08 17:28:49
Thankyou. :) It was a vulnerability on the server end so nothing short of a refund in full would of been acceptable.

Hello. Owner if bitvegas here. We use the blockchain.info API for deposits to the server. When a deposit is made our server is notified via HTTP from blockchain.info
Unfortunately the blockchain.info HTTP was down for two days. I did not expect it to take so long either for it to come up. We could only process deposits manually and I was doing my best to process all support tickets made.
We are not a scam. Chances are your deposit has already come through since this post as the API is working again. But if not please provide your minecraft username and I can credit your deposit, in which you can withdraw back out if you do not want to play at BitVegas anymore
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:12:40
Best reply all day!
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:20:21
This site has no malware. I am unsure why you have received this error but I shall look into it. EDIT: To confirm please try visiting  . It seems just the .net domain is having problems even though they are pointing to the exact same destination.
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:25:35
Yes I have had some good feedback about people not liking CPC. I am working on a Pay-Per-Hour system as we speak to be added :) EDIT: We have now updated to pay-per-hour
@_date: 2013-05-28 02:26:51
BitVegas already has an active community that have been excited for the new casino for some time. This screenshot is all that most of them have seen.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:07:51
Agreed. Ƀitcoin ftw
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:07:32
The time has been pulled forward to 7AM PST
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:12:17
Where's the party at?
@_date: 2013-07-09 09:08:28
Ok I just presumed this was your project. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:03:55
Fixed now
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:33:38
If it's true. I applaud the guy. It's genius.
@_date: 2013-09-15 06:33:40
Show prices in BTC :) untested example: 
$price = 1.49;
$bitstamp = json_decode(file_get_contents("
echo(($price / $bitstamp-&gt;last) . "BTC");
@_date: 2013-05-27 16:59:03
The high roller room will have max bets of 2BTC. Which may be raised even further in the near future.
Some games have payouts of over 600 BTC with a 2 BTC bet.
