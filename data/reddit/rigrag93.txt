I run an ecomm shop dedicated to crypto themed products. We've made so much "free" money in the last two years, you'd have to be dumb to not be accepting BTC/LTC at the least. At this point we've sold $25 shirts that are now valued at $300+

It's not a shill. At the time of creating my shop, Coinbase was the only platform that allowed me to accept transactions with a direct plug in to my ecommerce store.
