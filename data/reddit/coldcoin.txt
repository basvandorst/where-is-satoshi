Look at it now. That's bitcoin dude. Step away from the screen when that happens. The only time Ive lost money is when I freaked out and sold the dip.

Hang in there 2 days. Your world will look completely different. 2 days my friend. And get back on meds asap. even if you need to go to the emergency room to get them.

Ha I remember freaking out and playing every move. I was nutso. It's nice to not feel the need to buy either. I prefer owning bitcoin to it owning me. It's more fun.

Have you considered your power costs? Are you on tier pricing? Also, can you even purchase equipment? Seems the big guys are buying up leaving nothing but a wait list. Are you willing to prepay and wait many months for delivery? How much gains would be lost waiting for months for delivery had you bought btc? I think there is s lot of hidden risk. It dies sound sexy though. 
Sounds a bit like my plan to buy a 3d printer, print a 3d printer, then return 3d printer I bought. 
Honestly I went down that road when I started and could only see the upside. Luckily availability was waitlisted so I kept researching and it didn’t make sense when I saw all the prices. BTW, this was tight before the 2013 rise.

Just look at the history. It's the dance. You're just feeling it now because you're in.

If it really does pencil out go for it. Especially if you’re looking at only dropping 1800 bucks (think that’s what I read). You should get a real world idea of the potential. I can’t get a feel if you are starry eyed and can’t see the nuance like I tend to be or if you really do have a solid feel for the math. Not for me to figure out. Hope you’ll update the thread when you make a decision. 
To clarify I chose to steer away from mining then.

Tangible definition (i had to Google it)
: easily seen or recognized. capable of being precisely identified or realized by the mind (i guess this is how I'm looking at it.)
: able to be touched or felt (intangible yes by this definition)

Good distinction, however, you can hold a safe deposit box. Well, touch it at least. I guess the question at the end of the chain is, what is a bitcoin and how do we know we even have one? How is it different than pretending to drink tea at a tea party with my daughter? Except of course, everyone is in on it and agrees to trade goods and services for the pretend tea. Maybe tangible is a better word than physical, as that usually refers to either the container or the keys to the container. Good thoughts sqiq.

I love seeing new contributions to the BTC community daily. Looks good Chris.
This sortof feels like one of those movies where the main character runs into his twin in public. The one he never knew existed. I sent you an email...
