Or more specifically: We have already seen how excessive rules and regulations can harm consumers.  FinCEN restricting "open-loop" gift cards has made it more difficult for consumers to send money to family and friends.  Excessively strict rules in the Dodd-Frank Act have led many banks to no longer offer international remittances at all.  These actions clearly do not benefit consumers, and simply make it more difficult and expensive to send money.

The "three steps removed" refers to the allegation that Shrem sold bitcoins to someone who resold them to some people who might have bought drugs.  Depeding on how you look at it, it could be considered only two steps removed.

Oh, I've had something worse happen than just getting my bank card declined.   I tried to pay an invoice with paypal.  The payment went through, then the next day I get an angry email from the merchant accusing me of making a chargeback.  Apparently paypal decided that the payment was suspicious and held the payment.  After some back-and-forth with the merchant, I convinced them that I didn't make a chargeback, but paypal is still holding the money, and won't release it to the merchant or return it to me.  I hate paypal.

There's quite a difference between mock trading and real trading.  In real trading, you have people trying to break into your computer and steal bitcoins.  In real trading, you have to worry about bank wires getting delayed for days or weeks.  In real trading, you have to worry about unreliable exchanges going bankrupt, suspending your account, or not letting you withdraw your funds.

Wei Dai wasn't the first to propose a distributed P2P currency.  The idea is much older than that.  A 1993 paper titled 'Digital Silk Road' proposed a P2P payment system, although that proposal was a bit different than bitcoin and can be described more as a distributed hawala system.  Nonetheless, the idea has been around a very long time.  It's a bit surprising that it took so long to really catch on.

If you're getting free transactions through Paypal, then I assume you are a non-profit chartiy.  If so, Bitpay will also process payments at no charge.  
If it's completely unacceptable to have even a remote chace of losing funds, then you need to stop using Paypal.  Have you even read the Paypal agreement?  What you are asking for is completely impossible with Paypal.

Well, it can work like this.  Suppose I have 65 bitcoins at 65 different addresses.  I bet each one at satoshidice 1.5259% odds.  Now I have 64 losing bets, but one winner with 63.968 btc.  Now when I spend that money and someone looks at the blockchain history, they see the one winning bet where I got really lucky at satoshidice, but they don't see the losing bets.  Thus it obscures where most of the money came from originally.

What are they going to do with the chips?  The chip packages are subject to damage and oxidation if you handle them a lot.  You really don't want to be shipping these around in small batches.  You'll just end up with a bunch of broken chips.
