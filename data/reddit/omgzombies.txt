I respect that. The guy learned all about bitcoin, identified some problems with it, decided it wasn't for him. 
I think he's wrong, but we'll see how it plays out.

The age of hobby mining is largely at an end.  I own a few Antminer S3's, but the big players in the game just make my contribution almost worthless.  Thankfully, I've got free power so why not?
The bitcoin mining network is ludicrously powerful, and almost all of that power is owned by corporate interests.  There's nothing all that fun about bitcoin mining, you plug in an ASIC and point it at a pool.  Few people will be doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.  Certainly it's somewhat interesting as a hobby now, but will it really be once Bitcoin becomes what we all hope it will be, the currency of the future?
If mining isn't profitable bitcoin is in trouble, especially as we gain users and approach other scalability issues.

I'm running a few AntMiner S3+, the only reason it's profitable at all is that power is included with my HOA fee. Sure, the barrier to entry is pretty low but unless you've got a deal on electricity costs there's absolutely no point in running a miner as a hobbyist. 
I don't see the direction mining is going reversing any time soon. More and more of the mining will be taken over by businesses, as you'd expect with a mature product like Bitcoin is becoming. There's nothing wrong with this, it is just the way of the world.

Miners already do this now, that's why higher transaction fees will be processed at a higher priority.  
@_date: 2015-11-10 01:13:50
Not really. The protocol self-corrects its difficulty such that the average time to solve a block remains 10 minutes, regardless of how much processing power is working towards solving these blocks. So the more hashes per second the network is doing, the harder the blocks are to solve. 
This is why when bitcoin was brand new, mining with CPU or GPU processors was still possible, but now you absolutely need a dedicated piece of hardware known as an ASIC. The difficulty is just too high to ever solve a block without specialized equipment due to everyone having that specialized equipment.

I work in IT and I'd say roughly 70% of my coworkers have no college degree. Mostly they make up for it with experience and knowledge of the field, and they command a substantially higher than average salary for their age. 
Most of the people I know with college degrees are making less money than me and operating under the weight of their student loans. 
College just isn't a good investment for a large part of the population. People look at me like I'm insane when I talk about this, though, because it's so agreed upon that college is what an intelligent person does after high school. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 18:20:33
Nah. Absolute most they could manage without breaking the protocol somehow would be mining the blocks quickly until the difficulty adjusts. I can't remember the number of blocks offhand, but it usually takes about two weeks at normal discovery rates. After they mined all the blocks, the difficulty would increase so that it took 10 minutes again on average.

Actually a good question. OP found someone's bitcoin private key, but there's nothing to say maybe the guy's kid didn't install it on his computer and the guy had never heard of it.

I'm a mid level sysadmin. Certificates are helpful, but experience is king in my field. College degrees seem to be mostly extraneous, as long as you can get past HR (which comes back to your knowing people to get your foot in the door point). 
It entirely depends on the field, but I think the majority of college majors simply do not pay off in the end. Many would be better served by joining the work force and gaining experience rather than spending money on a 4 year degree that will not guarantee you better job prospects. 
This is entirely anecdotal, but most graduates I encounter have a degree in something I'd consider at best dubious for their employment prospects. Business and journalism degrees are what I encounter the most, it seems. I'd argue that most of these people would be better off skipping college entirely.

Bitcoin is being discussed right now in the media thinly disguised as "blockchain tech". Bitcoin is the major player in blockchain, and it's interesting to see how the world at large recognizes the value intrinsic to the technology yet lacks an understanding of the power that bitcoin wields through decentralization of the protocol. 
I'm interested in Bitcoin as a value holding commodity, a currency, a technology, and a motivator of social change. The blockchain articles are interesting to me because they're a great indicator that there's value in bitcoin, due to interest in the underlying technology.
I think the blockchain stuff is relevant.

Screams scam to me, I can't imagine this being profitable in any real sense.
@_date: 2015-10-15 14:18:08
Yeah, actually found this thread after googling the error and noticed how recent it was.  I'm having the same issues.
Earlier in the thread OP mentions they're working on it.  Hopefully there will be a resolution soon.  Couldn't hurt to send them an email as well support
