Correct. There's no such thing as minimum fee. It's calculated between the difference of inputs - outputs. I'll edit this.

The thing is: Imagine a world where the transactions fees were 1 sat/Byte. If the value of the Bitcoin was 100K USD that means that even the most simple transaction with the least transaction possible was 0,23$ (considering a transaction size of 226 bytes). This means that micro transaction was not possible even with the lowest fee possible. My question to you is: Why does the blocksize is relevant for the scalability? The answer is: NONE. In order to have micro transactions we need to have 2nd layer technologies.

Schnorr signatures will reduce number of signatures needed when "bundling transactions" thus reducing block space needed for signatures. Don't really know the details. Some info here:

Yes you're right. I was writing my own post when I saw yours:

We have that problem even if we exclude the demand problem. I literally considered the minimum fee possible 1 sat per Byte. This is a urgent matter indeed.

Yup just a better transaction management system so that they can bundle multiple transactions in one.
