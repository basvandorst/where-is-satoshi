No, but it is a huge increase for everyone else. When other companies see that, they will start accepting bitcoin. And when all those companies start stealing sales from Amazon, it will get noticed.

And most people are paying a 1% fee to coinbase to buy the BTC or often more if they are buying on localbitcoins so there goes at least 33% of your discount.
But the bigger point is that it doesn't grow the bitcoin economy. Amazon has no idea that you are a potential bitcoin customer. If we can get more companies to accept bitcoin from customers, at some point they will start seeking suppliers that will take bitcoin for their merchandise. Every time you shop using Gyft, you are making sure that such adoption will be slower to happen. But if you buy from merchants like overstock and tigerdirect, you are increasing the speed at which that will happen.
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:01:25
"Of the more than 4,300 customers who have paid with bitcoins, Overstock.com estimates almost 60% are new customers"
That big of in increase in new customers is pretty big news. That is a number that should start to scare other merchants. Those are sales that would have been bought elsewhere before but Overstock managed to poach those sales due to accepting bitcoin. It might be a drop in the bucket right now, but as long as that number keeps going up, Amazon will notice sooner or later.

In most circumstances, I don't see the difference in buying from Gyft versus exchanging for fiat other than the fees being in your favor. But as I said, if you didn't already have a huge stash of coin, or are a miner, it really makes no sense to buy bitcoin just so you can buy from gyft. The savings don't justify the hassle. And the vast majority of people aren't miners and don't have a huge stash from being early adopters. The only reason why the rest of the world will start adopting bitcoin is when merchants start accepting it. So if we want the bitcoin economy to grow, we, as early adopters, need to work to convince merchants to accept bitcoin directly.

All the more reason to never use paypal. Based on what you are saying, I (or anyone else) could file a complaint against you with paypal and get your funds locked down so that you can't access you money. I don't have  to have any legal justification to do so, but I could force you to have to wade through the verification and disputes process just to regain access to your funds.

Their is a formula that is the basis for the code that governs the blockchain, but that limitation is self imposed.  It is a regulation of the code that limits the number of bitcoins. You can try to change the rhetoric to make it seem different, but conceptually, there is little difference.


I can just as easily say that the FED doesn't *centrally enforce* the rules around the US currency because they rely on local law enforcement or the Secret Service to go after people who violate their rules. Does that mean that US Dollars are not fiat currency?


That is exactly the difference I am talking about. Gold has intrinsic value because we cannot create more of it. But both US Dollars and Bitcoins can be created. They each have their own set of rules that dictate when and where they can be created and those rules are set by a central authority.

How is that? If you have USD in Mt Gox, trading for BTC is a max fee of 0.6%. Moving the BTC has no fee (other than the 0.0005BTC blockchain fee). Then Selling the BTC on CampBX has a fee of 0.55%. To move the USD out of CampBX is either a fee of $2 for ACH or $0.25 if you use Dwolla.

Are we all not working off the same bitcoin protocol? That absolutely is centralized. I get that open sourced software has some aspect of decentralization to it, but in order to operate within the network we all need to be running the same code, and that is centralization. That is why the 51% problem exists. There is a rule in our centralized code that allows  for the possibly to double spend bitcoins, and because we all run central code that will propagate those transactions, we have a problem.  A truly decentralized currency would not have that problem.

Taking a loss while doing arbitrage is different than paying a fee, which is what KIND_DOUCHEBAG had stated, and what I pointed out was false, so no, that isn't exactly the point.
But I have no sympathy for anyone who is hurting because of this now. Anyone who has continued to keep all their eggs in Gox's basket despite all the issues they have had, is part of the problem. Any business that put it self in a position where it can experience a single point of failure is, frankly, stupid. The volume problem on the other exchanges is due to the fact that these business have not bothered to diversify their risk. Maybe this time they will learn their lesson.

The Mt Gox/CampBX spread is usually far less than that and I have just as often seen BTC on CampBX be higher than on Gox. 
The Price on BTC-e and Bitstamp is much closer to what CampBX is so that would make me think that the price on Gox is out of whack with the rest of the market due to this news. And in fact, the price on Gox yesterday was about 108 when campbx was 107.
As far as liquidity goes, there is enough between all the other exchanges to handle much of this. And most large buyers have money in the other exchanges already and can move more in quickly if needed. The market will adjust.

The Schildbach Wallet is not a "lite" wallet and dones't let you create easily swapable wallets for cold storage and the such, so it doesn't compare to Bitcoin Spinner on any of those fronts. And, again, downloading and keeping the blockchain synced on your phone is problematic at best, and a nightmare waiting to happen at worst. I don' care how recoverable the wallet is, it causes more problems than it is worth. And trying to recover and resotre wallets with that app is not something to take on lightly.

Everyone else? Who else? It's only you an me here now. I don't see "everyone else" supporting your statement. I think it was anything but obvious. And that still doesn't account for the fact that a "charge" is very different than a "loss" when you are talking about financial matters. That isn't being pedantic, that is being accurate. And it still isn't 10% no matter how you look at it.
In running a bitcoin business, you do have to take the risk of Bitcoin failing, but you don't have to take the risk of limiting yourself to a single exchange. And, to date, there have been no failures of the bitcoin protocol it self but many failures of exchanges. So anyone who fails to avoid that specific risk, when it is so easy to avoid, is being stupid. We can still build bitcoin without all relying on Gox.

I have a really hard time seeing how you can say that the consensus is artificial. When 97% of experts agree on something, that is as close to a consensus as you will ever get for such a large group of people.
About half of those scientists listed on that page are not denying that climate change is caused by humans, only that the exact numbers might not be correct or that there are still to many unknowns to make a firm conclusion. The remaining ones, if you go read their statements, often say that while humans might be part of it, they might not be all of it. That is a far cry from your statement that "there are scientists who dispute the whole concept."
And anthropocentric climate change is the current theory because it is *the idea that best fits all of the facts as we currently know them*. If additional facts can be established that show that the theory is incorrect, then we can all move onto the next best idea, what ever that is. But the problem with the people in your camp is that there are too many facts that do no fit into the idea that the current cycle of climate change is a natural process.
But even if we are wrong about climate change, the potential damage that could be done to the Earth's ecosystem by failing to act far outweighs the potential negative impacts to our society if we do.

I am assuming that you are either exchanging goods or cash for bitcoins. In either case, the jurisdiction is going to be clear almost all of the time and there is physical property to be tracked. It really doesn't matter that the other side of the transaction was for bitcoins.
In the case of services exchange, get the other party to sign a contract and verify their identity before making the transfer.

If you read the article, it says that Chairman Alan Blinder said virtual currencies "may hold long-term promise" in 1995. Bernanke did not say this.

I would trust self posted user reviews about as much as I would trust the site it self, which is to say very little. I would trust an escrow service if they are Bonded, Licensed &amp; Insured and they post that info publicly so I can call up the third parties and verify the info. Otherwise, my personal risk tolerance would be about $200.

Stolen what? The spyware out there intercepts text and network data. I've heard of nothing that copies screenshots images off of your phone. I guess it is possible but very unlikely. But if that is your concern, that can easily be prevented:
Before installing the app, do a factory reset of your phone. Once you have installed the app and launched it, put it in Airplane Mode. Then make your screenshots, print them and delete off of your phone.

"There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."

I am not stretching the idea of a central authority nearly as far as you are. There *is* a finite supply of both gold and bitcoins, but that is not at all what I am talking about here. In one case, there is man-made and centrally enforced rules that dictate the fundamental value of bitcoins, and with gold there is an actual, physical limit on the amount of the item. There is no central athority that can ever change that. And that is the difference.
And speaking as a Geologist, there are no "laws of geology".

Nope. I'm mostly annoyed at the people around here that are just speculators and only post about what the price of bitcoin is.

Yes, I have. And I still don't see how any of that would be a security risk with the steps I've outlined above. First, you have to grant any app root permissions before it can do anything, and second, none of those apps are going ot download your entire gallery to hunt for screenshots of your wallet QR code. Nowhere in my steps did I type in any private keys or passwords, so no key loggers are going to be an issue. If you see a security issue in any of what I said, please be specific in what you think it is. 'Cause I'm not seeing it.

No, we know a lot.


In the scientific world there is a large difference between saying that we do not know something and that we can't speak to somthing with certaintly. The casues of Ice Ages fall in to the later category. We know a lot of factors that cause Ice Ages, but we can't say with absolute certainty why something happened.


What the fuck does that even have to do with anything? Was he an expert on any of this? No. The guy had an MBA which does not qualify him in anyway to be cited in regards to any scientific theory.
I get the feeling that a lot of your distrust of scientific methods, comes from a lack of understanding of the process. The scientific process is the best way humans have to discover knowledge. Never in the history of human kind have we been able to discover so much about the world around us and that is entirely due to us using the Scientific Method. Unless you can dispute some facts about anthropomorphic climate change, I have a hard time seeing you in any other light than as a crazy tin-foil hat wearing conspiracy nut.
Please, lets try to deal in facts. Not fallacies such as appeals to authority or confirmation bias or half truths. What do we know as a fact and what things that we thought were facts can be shown to be wrong?

There are those here who are involved because they are treating bitcoin as a commodity and looking to make money off of it. You cannot trust their advice because it is possible that their sole reasoning is to either increase or decrease the price of BTC so that they can profit, and you cannot know what their intentions are.
Then there are those who are in bitcoin for the long haul and they are really getting sick of the people who are showing up here and asking questions just like yours to try and make a quick buck. You cannot trust their advice because you don't know what their intentions are.
In short, you, and the other 100 people who have asked this question in the last week without doing a basic search to find  all the other threads that talked about this, cannot trust anything you read here. Go figure out what your risk acceptability then decide if you want to exchange your money for bitcoin.

"As far as I am concerned man-made global warming is nothing more than a hypothesis that hasn't got any basis in fact. Every day more scientists are modifying their initial views."
Bloom argues that the global climate has actually been cooling down since 2002, ***and bases this on "the very early skiing season" each year.***
EDIT: 
Bloom confessed that he used to visit brothels in Hong Kong, claiming that "terrified young women beaten into prostitution often from Eastern Europe [...] is only a very small aspect of the flesh trade", and concluded that "in short, most girls do it because they want to."
Bloom told an interview that, "no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age."
Bloom was filmed at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen congratulating the French for bombing the Rainbow Warrior, a Greenpeace ship

I think anyone who is buying bitcoins as an investment should look elsewhere. I buy bitcoins because I think it is a better currency than what the government offers. And as such, I don't worry about the price because the economic fundamentals of bitcoin have not changed. The utility of bitcoin has not changed. A year from now, there will be more people using bitcoin, therefore there will be a greater demand.
If you look at the price from day to day, it can be very stressful. I do not do this. I bought some last week. I will my some more this week. And I will buy more the week after that. I have been doing this since 2011. I have not regretted doing so.

Coinbase didn't start out large and they've always made do without charging such fees. And people aren't going to pay double or triple the fees just to avoid a monopoly. And a smaller company should be able to compete with a larger on on price. Look at CampBX vs MtGox. Mt Gox is huge compared to CampBX but Gox charges 0.05% more. If CampBX can get by with charging less than their much larger competitor, why can't BTCQuick?

Because if ghash.io is actually interested in profits, then the most profitable thing to do is use their computing power to mine new blocks, not take down the network. Crashing the network doesn't make them any money. And besides that, even if the people running the pool are assholes that want to do bad things, the members of the pool are not and will remove their hashing power from the pool if the admins start doing shitty things that threaten their own ability to make profits.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:25:43
I don't see the allure of Mt Gox. The price on Campbx is nearly always the same as Gox, sometimes a little higher, and some times a little lower. My orders get filled instantly on Campbx. Who really cares if Gox is the biggest. How does that make any difference (Unless you are buying huge amounts of bitcoin and actually need that volume). For the majority of us that are buying &lt;$1000 at a time, campbx is more than adequate and is much easier to use.

Sounds like you actually think "unregulated" currencies are a joke. In reality, USD is just as virtual as BTC, expect that the Fed regulates it so that people like your self can't do dumb things like what you did.
But what made you look at that graph and think it was a good time to buy? Is it possible that, rather than deciding that the best course of action is to only use regulated currencies, that maybe you should learn to see the obvious signs of pump-and-dump speculators, and not make bad choices?
If you really want to treat BTC as a commodity rather than a currency, then you should do the same thing as you do with other commodities: Buy on the way down and sell on the way up. That way you never get burned.

btcchina is currently at ¥750.46 (121.11 USD) and bitcoin-24 is at 53.84€ (70.60 USD). When MtGox opens back up, the price will be somewhere in between.
