from when I was in iran, you can pay in lots of places with us$. and you can exchange us$ almost everywhere to iranian rial.
I guess it would be more convenient to convert bitcoin with localbitcoins into us$ as us$ is more stable than iranian rial.
I hope this makes sense. I was very drunk  when I wrote this.

The government of Argentina is not socialist. It is a mixture between Parties that are Peronism (centrist), Radicalism center-left, Liberal-conservatism and right-wing factions opposed to Kirchner.
There are only 6 socialists in the government (5.70%)

I was thinking about that too. But I wonder if the gift coupon will then work if my shipping address is outside of the US...
But I will try it for ordering some books from amazon or something :)

wow great :)

ahhh, I got to the last(?) "GA" one before someone else solved it

wow great. I also take donations in drugs :D

I mean experimentation with alternative forms of currency, and alternative forms of finance. I think it would be possible to test out various forms of economy using bitcoin. You can't simply change the whole economy of some state to try-out something. But with bitcoin and alternative bitcoin based currencies, there is lots of new room for experimentation

next time better use this  to create your papers; they would be more scientific then I guess

Aluminium is a great material to work with, but thinking how much of our environment gets polluted and contaminated during the extraction and refinement of it, it would be better to use a different material:

Any hint on which notation is used to write down coordinates?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:15:40
I am actually thinking about doing that. I plan to program something during my next semester holidays. My idea is a website, where you can create your own financial instruments, stocks, bonds, options and so on, and sell/buy those between other members on the website. Registration and creation of any products will be completely free. To pay for the hosting of the website, I will probably take 0.3% or so of each successful trade, or use google ads or similar.

Bitcoin is 100% secure. The problem is how you store the access information, wallet and so on on your computer. But this is the same problem with any digital payment/finance application. Probably millions of paypal, creditcard, bank accounts get phished and emptied in the same way every day.

I totally agree with you that a "captcha code" system is in efficient. But I think you don't understand how the tor network works. The ip address of the destination server is never revealed to any other computer. Routing information can be added or deleted on the fly.
I agree that it might be difficult to differentiate between normal high traffic users and bot's doing DOS (especially if they place orders like normal users). But it still would be easy to create a limit on orders per person basis (like 1000/per day), if it is used up, the routing automatically gets deleted.
the "captcha website" could use a distributed system as well. Take a look at the message board system in freenet. That is very slow though, but that is not the point. To login a user could post a message with his username and password encrypted using a public key from gox in the board. As reply he would get a "captcha" image encrypted using his public key, which he will then again have to type and encrypt using the public key of gox and post in the board. Finally he will receive a encrypted message containing his unique .onion url to access the exchange, valid for 24h or until his order limit is reached or he is banned.

I know how DDOS works

got there too, but now someone else solved the riddle apparently

as an extra precaution. if you ever visit any websites in the darknet, .onion websites and such. especially links on the hidden wiki. 99% of those are scam, and people trying to take your bitcoins. even links to serious sites there are frequently changed to scam and phishing websites.
@_date: 2013-09-29 15:40:26
of course they get viruses, and trojans and everything else.

why are there still some addresses in the non-used address part which still contain balances? It puts used addresses correctly in the used part, but in the part below there are both used and unused addresses without a clear structure it seems.

they had music instruments too
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:35:28
well, everyone using the website could link their profile with profiles on other sites where they already got some reputation. The value of a financial instrument would be undetermined at the beginning, and could be chosen freely by (the first) buyers, or set to a specific price by the seller for the initial offering. After that the value would be determined by the average value someone is willing to pay for or sell it for in the market.
As an example, if someone registers his startup company, and he needs some money as an initial investment. He could create some "stocks" of the company, give an accurate description and references on the website. He could either declare a fixed fee for each share. Or give them away to a price that can be chosen freely by the buyer. He would also have the option to declare a percentage he will receive of each successful trade of any share. All the information about the shares will be publicly and transparently listed at all times. When his company makes any profit, he would have the option to transfer a chosen amount of money to some bitcoin address, from where it will be automatically distributed as dividends to all accounts holding some of that companies shares.
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:00:47
yes I agree with that. but maybe it would be possible to create a distributed routing network (like tor without the encryption part).

don't throw away the sand from those things, it makes great fun if you mix it with iron oxide. you can literally forge some bitcoins with it.

the idea might be great. but the chances of getting scammed are great too
