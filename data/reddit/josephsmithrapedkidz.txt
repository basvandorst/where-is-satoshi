These people are why the SEC exists.

In hope to God you sold. We will be back there soon.

I honestly am tempted to buy here, but why should I believe there is any upside? All of the retail folks got fucked. I honestly know a ton of reg. Joes who got screwed or know a dude who got screwed. I know a girl who plowed 10s of k in at around 18k using a personal loan because she is a libertarian. Seriously don't know who is left who doesn't have a tainted opinion besides true believers. If housing took nearly 10 years to recover, and it is useful, why should I believe in BTC's recovery?

I know a girl who took out a 40k personal loan to buy in at 18k.

Bro, I, like most people, switch accounts sometimes. In 10 years you'll be looking back and thinking "wow, BTC really did drop to a couple hundred dollars, it isn't the money I lost feel worst about, it is that I wasted so much opportunity and time whiteknighting bullshit."

Just checking in after almost a year. We were all telling you guys at 16k and 13k that we were going down and hodling is a dumb strategy. I bet those 16k holders wish they had sold. They could buy 4-5x as much BTC now! Fuck those that dissuaded people from selling when it was in their best interest. I'm planning to buy back in around 2k.
