I already have a domain with https and letsencrypt; the website is functioning well, with https.
 
Letsencrypt has generated several files or at least 2, I don't remember.  Which one should I use for electrum?

1) should I create a new addresses for each customer? or even for each payment of each customer?
2) how can I automatically monitor the balance of a certain wallet or addresses? via the command line or rpc interface I think. so that once a payment is received on that address or wallet, a user is given access to a certain service of my website.
