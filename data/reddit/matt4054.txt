The queue is massively jammed right now!

Alternatively, you can also see a live chart of the Bitcoin queue from this website (improvements coming soon!)

Thank you very much, I will gladly add a QR code :)

While investigating my chart anomaly on  I noticed that some zero-fee transactions were included directly into blocks, without "waiting" in the transaction pool first. I have seen two recent occurrences on the linked chart (see image)
Of course, by protocol, miners are allowed to do so (because they can). But eventually, this could lead to a "parallel market" of the confirmation process, where you pay directly (or indirectly) a pool to include your (possibly zero-fee) transactions into the next block that they mine, bypassing the original (Bitcoin Core) block constitution, fee-based algorithm.
What do you think?

The last 2 days have been abnormal in terms of transaction queue size. The blockchain is **overloaded**. I have created a website to visualize live charts of the Bitcoin queue:
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:15:31
One of the thing that has been done (by myself) is creating a website were everyone can **visualize the problem**:
Now is the last time to increase the block size before we see a shift to a transaction fee "auction" scheme...
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:08:06
Thanks :)
I will do my best to include more data and a table with the breakout of transaction fees and the average queue time before confirmation of transaction (and/or median time)
@_date: 2016-06-17 09:13:30
When did you send your transaction?
@_date: 2016-06-16 08:04:11
Yes, actually I already have the total fees per fee class in my database, I will add it to the visualizations soon, probably before the week-end.

Oh, thank you **so much**, you're AWESOME!
I will try to add tables, numbers and fine transaction fee class / breakout in the very near future :-)
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:17:43
I am glad to announce that the expiry time has been increased to 24 hours. Changes will be reflected accordingly after unconfirmed tx reach or exceed the previous timeout.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:19:03
There was a bug in the presentation of the stacked charts, where the cumulative values were used for each series instead of the correct data.
The bug has been fixed and all graphs are now correct.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:37:24
The blockchain is currently overloaded and it explains why your transaction got stuck for so long, while it wouldn't have, under normal circumstances here.
You can checkout live stats of the Bitcoin queue here:
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:18:07
Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain is experiencing huge delays as the queue is heavily overloaded!
See  for live charts of the queue.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:41:44
**ALL** transactions are heavily delayed at the moment!
As other people pointed out, 12 s/B is too low a fee right now. I would personally recommend at least 75 s/B for inclusion in the next 1-3 blocks.
See my **live queue charts** for stats: 
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:12:52
The cause of the transaction delays is clearly the unconfirmed transaction buildup in the blockchain. You can see live charts of the Bitcoin queue here:
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:36:36
Well I guess that could lead to a second-market for low-priority transactions, where pools with &gt;10% could even offer statistical "guarantee" (&lt;-- add many quotes there) of speedy inclusion.
Block constitution means more or less the algorithm that was in the "original" bitcoind to form a block.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:39:52
The backlog has cleared up now (see charts), everything back to normal :-)
But for how long ?

Imagine that I'm ACME-BTC Corp. and that I need to send huge transactions (many outputs, typically) on a regular, predictable basis. I could imagine dealing directly with a major pool to negotiate a fee "contract" over a period of time, where tx fees are fixed (vs. fluctuant on the primary fee market) and the pool guarantees inclusion of my transactions in its mined blocks.
This would be especially useful in times of block congestion (i.e. like last Friday...)
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:22:51
It's just the queue backlog that has cleared up.

You can see **live queue charts** the Bitcoin mempool here:
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:00:57
Thanks for your input. I will consider extending it to 72 in order to match the default mempoolexpiry. I need to improve intermediate sum logic first however, because this huge pile of transactions is causing massive CPU usage :D
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:26:12
Blockchain jams have an interesting side :-)
@_date: 2016-06-20 02:53:08
Well, IMO it shows that the "parallel channel" of peer-to-peer brokerage with pools could be used. Although it should be in equilibrium economically speaking (as you said, pools would be stupid to include zero-fee tx when they could reap fees the usual way), there could be scenarios where the fee would be paid indirectly or otherwise dealt directly with the pool.

@_date: 2016-06-14 19:50:43
It is my own implementation of the mempool. I have again arbitrarily decided for an 8h cutoff, but AFAIK there is no official, "hard" value for mempoolexpiry. I could extend this to 24h or more in the future, if this becomes meaningful.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:57:18
QR code added, here we go! :-)

There is an **exceptional** unconfirmed transaction build-up in the Bitcoin queue that you can visualize here:
Things are going a bit better these last 2 hours, hopefully your transaction will get through in a few blocks from now.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:48:58
This suggestion has been made several times, and it's a very good one. It will definitely be added sooner than later as a complement or alternative to the fees on the Y axis.
The good news is that I have kept all raw data since the beginning to I should be able to correlate back from the start of the history.

I've been into Bitcoin since late 2012 so I know it's all about politics, but the point is information, really.
I am fascinated by bitcoin from a (socio-)technical point of view, Bitcoin as a world-scale experiment. So much that I brought together a dedicated website to watch the evolution and fee breakout of Bitcoin transactions over time.
I am not commenting about who should do what, how much this is a problem or not, and I have no interest in doing so. If you feel like my post is doing any of this, then you are probably casting your own fear, uncertainty and doubt over the subject.
If I should say anything about the future of Bitcoin, I would say it is here to stay for a long, long time. As for the price I would say it will rise mechanically, and as the corollary to my first assertion, it will keep rising for a long time.
edit: for context I am the one who made the website  from where the graph is taken
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:13:17
Yes, transactions are removed from mempool after 72 hours.
All unconfirmed transactions are committed to a database. Every new block removes the transactions that it contains from mempool, and in case this script misses something, other scripts check the tail of the queue against blockchain.info periodically.
So I'm pretty confident that if there are more unconfirmed tx in my data than in others, it's probably because I'm keeping track of more incoming tx overall.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:41:16
See the status of the unconfirmed tx backlog here.
As soon as the backlog has cleared, your transaction will go though. Such a huge queue is unusual, as you can see on

If the trends happens to confirm, it will be the third major 10+ hours delay (rough average) for pretty much all tx within normal fee levels.

The thing is, while you can vary your fees in accordance with the instant fee landscape in real time, it also adds an extra burden both technically and economically speaking for legitimate, regular user of Bitcoin as a transaction network.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:52:03

You are perfectly right and it's an improvement that I'm working on. Clustering transactions and including that info in the visualization is as challenging as it is revealing to understand the mempool.
BTW yes it is sat/B indeed (see the text on the homepage)
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:44:49
See 
It's the highest peak since the site started tracking unconfirmed transcations
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:44:25
Still no sign of decrease in the 24 hour trend
This is definitely an all time high for the mempool!
