Go on bitcoin.org and show her the 2 minute video.

Hasn't responded to me for a month 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:58:34
Also would be good to get a fee estimate before spending - as is with other traditional BTC wallets

How to disabled STONEWALL to reduce the transaction size? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 06:44:03
Not exactly - There needs to be a route within a certain amount of hops. With Lightning as new as it is, sometimes there can be routing errors because there isn't a channel route to get there.
The idea is that, eventually, everyone will be connected to everyone within a few hops. But at the moment that isn't the case so it is sometimes needed to open a channel yourself so you can be sure that you have a route 
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:53:40
If you could link that'd be great.

Don't get your hopes up on getting a reply - scam site IMO
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:08:27
This an ad?
@_date: 2018-05-10 10:31:42
I thought the same about the fee - it cost about 800sat to open the channel and 16sat to make the payment to bitrefil 
You also say it is not possible to "top-up" a channel? So how would I go about using BitRefil again? As at the moment I have approx €3 there but I'd need €10 in the channel to pay for the phone bill. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 16:24:31
But you still have the issue of not being able to re-fund the channel

They said at the present moment in time they don't have any plans for lightning. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:48:29
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:13:19
Google! Urgh :(
@_date: 2018-05-15 10:44:09
Yes, a shame - but I think they're just waiting on lightning to mature and in the mean time they're making such advances with their standard wallet. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:31:48
I watched it - It was OK, not the best one I've watched. I really like Banking On Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-10 15:15:47
But I don't think it is possible to refill the channel with funds, or am I wrong? 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:55:16
Thanks, but according to your blog it is enabled by default, but I found it was not enabled by default. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:28:57
SegWit issue I see. Ok thank you 
@_date: 2018-05-08 15:37:31
Just opened my app to a massive notification saying YOU CAN NOW SEND BITCOIN CASH WITH EASE... needless to say, now that I have awoken to this bcash nonsense, this app will be DELETED. Yessssssssss
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:56:03
Use BISQ
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:07:20
Yes but with the wallet I use, once I spend it takes the sats so I'm unable to create another transaction with that amount 
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:49:06
Don't declare it and you don't pay any tax. GGWP
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:54:37
NO wallet should ever ask you for ID. If you give any sort of information, name, age, address, email, ID when using a wallet, uninstall it immediately

No wallet should ask you for ID
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:59:35
Then you need to first get a wallet 
@_date: 2019-03-09 22:58:45
I don't understand what you're trying to do? If you're sending bitcoin to someone you should send it from your own wallet 
@_date: 2019-03-23 18:49:35
You're signing up to a wallet? You're doing it wrong. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:42:41
What do you want it on, PC or mobile?
@_date: 2019-03-23 19:47:39
Look up Wasabi Wallet 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:50:11
Of course, understandable. Do not donate if you are skeptical at all.

When creating the lightning wallet for testnet - I am still not getting the macaroons created. I have already changed the swap file to the external disk but this has not helped.
Any ideas?
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:02:27
You need to sweep the master private key - then I believe it'll go to the Blockchain and process like a normal transaction over to your new wallet 
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:22:11
It isn't taxes. It's service fees
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:32:59
I've never used more than 5 sat/b. Normally use 1
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:42:52
Honestly surprised they don't support lightning.

It doesn't need to be under 500. And if you read my comment previously, I mentioned the funding tx fee
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:28:05
But at this current stage if you're wanting to send a payment that large to someone over lightning then you would need to open the channel directly to them. 
But this is a far deeper discussion where a payment that large is likely to be better suited to be on-chain. 
However a better scenario for lightning and such high capacity channel would be paying an allowence say. 
If you wanted to pay your kid 0.01 btc every week for doing some homework. Best to open a big channel then lightning over some BTC every week. 
Obviously that would be a very well off kid! Haha
@_date: 2019-12-20 17:59:54
Who wants another bank...
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:46:49
Nobody in their right mind should be using the coinbase wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-20 07:24:08
The capacity would be there with the channel. Say I opened a 2BTC channel directly to you, I could then send you 2BTC through that channel. 
But you're right in the sense that you would then need channels totalling 2BTC if I wanted to forward smaller amounts
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:44:42
You don't need a Ledger to control your own keys. While I'm not against a hardware wallet, I'm all for them, explore what's out there. But you can get desktop and mobile wallets that are non custodial. Which is what should always be used.
@_date: 2019-12-20 07:18:39
The lightning channel maximum can be manually configured to any amount now.
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:45:34
That is ALSO what I said previously...

I'll do it
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:41:58
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:47:29
Well if we disregard the fee for opening the channel, and you send the payment directly on a channel with 0 hops then it is 0 fee. 
But any form of hopping will cost a fee. 
I've never paid more than 3sats !
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:45:26
Use HodlHold or Bisq

So I had this working for about 6 months now. Originally on Bitcoin Core 0.16 then upgraded to 0.16.3 and that was fine.
I have now upgraded to Bitcoin Core [0.17.0.1]( and I understand that the RaspberryPi needs to verify blocks again.
The github notes it could take a few hours but my sync has been at 0% for around 3 hours now
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:54:09
Update? Same issue here 
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:23:19
Updated to the latest version and it was an instant fix. I don't see why this would fix it though. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:38:49
I have an LND node and using the addinvoice command to create the request
But that doesn't seem to work
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:35:16
What are you using to create the invoice? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 13:31:26
I am unable to withdraw from Lightning spin - I have my own node, even a channel with my node to them - But always an error trying to withdraw 
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:26:23
This was the issue. Thank you very much. A very basic oversight by myself. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:20:31
Bitrefil is working on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:09:33
Well there was cashilla but that since closed

What wallet are you using and how did you find the channel?

Since the update to Bitcoin 17.0.1 and LND 0.5.1....
issuing lncli commands is fine but bitcoin-cli commands now require me to be 'bitcoin' user and not admin
Any advice?
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:54:28
Thank you for telling me you're a ok target to rob... Never tell anybody, including the internet how much bitcoin you own.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:02:59
Reboot sorted it thanks. 
However lncli-versio lists "beta-0.5.1 commit="
 Nothing after the equals sign. 
Yet everything is functioning correctly. Opened my first channel after sync completed fine
