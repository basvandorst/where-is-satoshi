This would be true if the dollar prices of goods and services would be going up at the same pace with btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:21:59
to be honest bitcoin is something the world has never before seen, so it's pretty much useless to even speculate using traditional market models. none of them apply

Easier to find victims for theft
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:01:11
