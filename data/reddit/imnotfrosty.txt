You're not getting a haircut *yet*, but keep passively accepting the narrative from BFX and your loss is guaranteed. You're all being led around by the nose. There isn't even any evidence presented as yet that the "loss" had an exogenous cause. For a leveraged operation, this loss of capital and confidence is too large for operations to resume with BFX remaining a going concern. The legality of their "solution" is dubious at best.
If it's a legitimate theft, BFX staff should fall on their swords and liquidate. Anything else sets a ridiculous precedent for exchange/clearing house/bank/fund exit scams.

Surely, you're wrong. If the code can move funds, so can you, if you become part of the code. Do you think a human being manually writes every transaction, or any at all? It is likely automated, and runs at a high speed, with program interfaces that have access to customer keys.
I would not be surprised in the least if later we learn that statements about how the exchange works end up not matching up with reality. Hopefully, we will get to find out...

Bear in mind that in continuing to use their platform and accepting the bones they try to throw us, we may be understood to accept their narrative and consent to their "solution". I, for one, would not touch my account, as I believe their proposal to be both illegal and disingenuous.

⬆⬆ Look, a dutiful minion, hundreds of one-liners deep for BFX. Do you get paid to ride all of that dick, or do you do it for free?

I don't want to partner with the IRS. Why anyone would want to have a closer relationship with them is beyond me. Rather than have a chance to interpret for yourself what you owe (and potentially save loads), you would rather have an incompetent agency simply deduct the maximum from your bank account?

Of course it's useless for now. There is not a magic wand they can wave to summon liquidity or convoke capital to offer us. They can only prestidigitate -- either mesmerizing us with crap or offering up something true that will really mean something some day.
I've only incredulity and cynicism when it comes to this event, but it would be a really neat thing to be dead wrong about it. Whatever the case may be, it is completely unreasonable to expect BFX tokens to have any value in the short term.

It's just an opinion, but I don't believe solvency or normal operations are possible at this point. How about a show of hands... Irrespective of BFX's "bail-in", if, right now, you could log into BFX and withdraw every USD or BTC you find in your account, would you? Here in the [non]existence of this urge lies your answer.

Were I to attempt a theft of programmatically managed assets kept behind keys/certificates, I would not bother with the key(s). The most prosperous attack vector would be injection of code into said program(s). I can't fathom why so many are focused on the keys. The best way into the code is to collude with someone who maintains it or to have worked there previously.

I think you've only noticed what you'd like to think, unless, of course, you have BFX's ledger in front of you.

A bitcoin transaction can be anonymous, but is traceable. A cash transaction is not anonymous, but can be untraceable. The virtue Reason's article extols is cash being *untraceable*. This distinction is very important, but the author seems to see them as interchangeable.

Why don't we use gold mines for mass graves and hiding trash instead of just *wastefully* digging for gold? The gold is the reward for digging. Conflating PoW with tasks that have nothing to do with the reward weighs it down and will have unintended consequences.

Let's see... Behind this cashless "idea", we've got:
Larry Summers, high priest of OTC derivatives, murderer of Harvard's endowment (he risked it on interest rate swaps), and head cheerleader for pre-2008 derivative deregulation that brought us the securitization bubble.
Kenneth Rogoff, who seems to believe that austerity solves sovereign debt problems and that negative interest rates solve problems associated with lack of demand.

Why don't you start with a project that provides an friendly interface for multisig, or something that does statistical analysis of transactions? You may very well be a drone at some point, but just bear in mind that they are paying you to learn, and some day you will be doing what *you* want for money.
It would be more useful for you to just start making things and see where it leads than to ask the question the way you asked it.
