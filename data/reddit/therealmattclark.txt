If the funds have been seized or bank account locked due to the connection with the silk road, isn't that in a way a theft (if he did say that vaguely somewhere, though I don't remember reading it anywhere). Didn't the conversation go something along the lines of, they btc hasn't disappeared, we just can't get to it at the moment?

Truly amazing people aren't realizing this if they think they're getting over on this company. You will be paying that back pretty soon.

Too true. Some amazing people invested in bitcoin and some scary people too.

It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense
