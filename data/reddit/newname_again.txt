Gonna be hard to convince the miners to swap to bch now and they would have swapped had it been worth it.
I think that danger has passed but was worried about it on last Friday.

No one here knows, so ride along for fun.

For the entire crypto market? That is only 15x in 4 years, that is low balling it.

In Maple Syrup money :)

If they did they collude at 70% or higher then maybe they could mess things up but they would be hurting themselves. My guess is that core would come out and hit pause on everything (snapshot the chain prior to the bad miners). Then work out a way to continue, even so that would hurt bitcoin a ton.
Do I think that is going to happen? I bought more yesterday is your answer.

Stop making me pay for your shitty 'art'

And those that bought the dip got a 12x pay off.

Will hit 10k next week.

Use it to buy and hodl bitcoin for 5 years and invest more over the next year. I would do my best to make sure to put extra work into it to be able to invest more.

He wants some whale to come top him off.

Ballsy and if younger than 40 very smart. After 40 not so smart to risk it all.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:55:13
Women hate risk and generally avoid gambling, she saw bitcoin as a risky gamble and ran for the hills.

What would be more sad is knowing all your coins are lost and your loved ones can't use them.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:09:00
You could google what is GDAX.
And then stop worrying.
The only weird part is why they got moved their without you doing it (do you drink and bitcoin)?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:38:44
Imagine he had them secured and was hit by a truck but was sort of a loner. That is why I mention giving a years notice to the owners of those coins and then spread them out over 20 years.
Also I doubt anyone would feel bad if he does pop up and start spending the coins, he earned every bit.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:06:35
It appears to be locked up and essentially lost.
Also if consensus was formed those coins could be unlocked via a hard coded change specific to those addresses something along the lines that the coins would be sent to 10 different charities over the course of 20 years starting in 2025. 
People saying those coins are lost forever and saying bitcoin can only ever have 21 million coins do not follow up with the fact that the code can be changed if everyone or the vast majority agree to do so.

5-10 trillion dollar market by 2022 with bitcoin taking a solid 2/3rd of it.
So 40 times the current price, I am cool with bitcoin around 380k
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:54:12
Well do not encourage people to tell strangers how many bitcoins they have. Its reckless.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:40:38
Depends on your age but putting more than 20% is getting risky. If you are 25 and feel ballsy go for it with 40 grand.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:05:41
He is awkward enough to be him but he was balls deep in other stuff in 2010 to spend free time on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:54:39
It is not costing him much and he can easily afford it. Big picture he probably is getting a kick back from miners for doing it and is benefiting via FUD here for his shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:19:24
Live it up player! :) Seriously live and enjoy it.

"I've used the internet for a few year now and noticed that so many people are only thinking about how rich they are going to get off the internet. Fuck boomers that don't even understand the technology and are just wanting to get rich. Almost everyone I come across that talks about the internet wants to get rich off it." - trader51 in the 1990s
    
That is how stupid you sound OP, now apologize and delete this stupid post to regain some sense of dignity.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:41
140k ish for me so I will be buying some of your coins when you cash out (you are welcome and thanks!)
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:55:46
Maybe but now they will get the ip records from reddit and use this post as evidence against you.

We already do support them...tired of paying for bad poetry and shitty finger painting and I do not need to fund your crappy Operas.

I might already be there and save you the cost of a flight.

I will blow past 1 trillion soon enough
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:36:04
Being able to actually control my money.
No bank etc
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:38:45
Miners can now short their future earning to protect their downside. That alone adds stability to both price and mining. You won't be able to hedge alts directly so miners will be less likely to hot swap around chasing profits.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:17:56
I know
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:21:02
:) Fun isnt it
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:36:34
And then everyone decides to remove the extra useless bitcoin name from all the alts and we end up where we started :)
