You're not alone and everyone in the UK uses the same definition.
Since being on the fence suggests indecision and inaction it logically follows that these users are running Core and probably an old version too.  They have not yet committed to switching to the latest Core client or the latest Classic client.
Users choosing to run Classic have made a deliberate and very visible decision.

Well specically in the case of a "terrorist" organisation to be untraceable they would need :
* Genuine passport scan (high resolution - 600 dpi or better)
* Matching genuine or copied utility bill
* Matching genuine bank account
These are the ID verification the "easy to access" exchanges use and I add the bank account since generally transfering in from a bank account with a holder name which doesn't match the ID will get your account suspended pending additional verification.  Sure a copied passport scan could be used but this is irrelevant if it's not possible to deposit fiat $$.
In this scenario someone has to basically **volunteer** that their details and bank account are used to buy the bitcoin.  This is a huge risk for the indvidual since if the later bitcoin transactions are traced to the exchange (easy enough) then the exchange can check their records, provide the ID &amp; bank details used and then any investigation has a very strong lead out of cryptoland and into the real world.
Now there are some exchanges which allow you to pay with other means, Virwox for example allows Paypal but with VERY restrictive payment limits.  Still, you could just create a few hundred accounts (with paypal &amp; virwox) and then merge later with withdrawl so it's possible but not without hassle.  This can be extended to other exchanges who accept deposits via other means than a bank transfer, they exist but in a very restrictive form.
Due to the extra hassle virwox also trades at a +15% ish premium compared to other exchanges.
Now then with "access to resources" (assuming you mean money to invest here) I would buy myself some mining rigs and set myself up mining bitcoin.  Reason being that those freshly minted 25 BTC block rewards are only traceable to the IP address of the miner who processed the transaction.
This isn't really an easy route though since those mining rigs cost 10s of thousands of dollars to buy, ideally need cheap electric to run and most miners re-invest the reward to pay their bills.  As a result the anonymous bitcoin you earn is just profit after you subtract your investment &amp; running costs.
An additional route worth mentioning is that you could look to buy the private keys for fresh bitcoin rewards from the miners.  The draw backs I see with this though is that this would cost a premium (probably higher than the virwox premium) and ultimately there is still a route for law enforment to investigate.   Those bitcoin are still traceable back to a specific miner by IP (which if they are legit they won't be obscuring) and they will know your ID and bank details.
So why not just pay cash then ?  This sounds fine in principle but would only work for small amounts since most traders who accept cash (eg. localbitcoins.com) also ask for ID these days.  
However lets assume that you have acceptable fake ID though and having someone photograph you doesn't worry you (in-person traders often do this for their records).  An additional issue is that it's very unlikely that this could be done with any more than a few thousand dollars at a time so to build up any significant amount would require LOTS of face to face meetings.  Probably with different traders too in different locations and ideally with a team of different people working together.  Yes this can be done with the right "access to resources" (man power in this case) but it's high cost in time and possibly money (these volunteers might want compensating or otherwise paying).
Oh to link to the previous example any miner who accepted several hundred thousand (or million) dollars in cash for newly minted bitcoin would be very very dumb.  More so if they didn't check your ID, photo, next of kin, home address.... etc. etc.   These organisations are generally run by smart people but you never know so I have to acknowledge it's possible.
Nearly done.... next up is bitcoin mixer/tumber sites ! These get a hourable mention since they usually claim to anonymise your bitcoin by mixing them in with other peoples, you could even repeat this again and again.
If this case I think this just muddys the trail but doesn't remove it.  If say the NSA really **really** wanted to trace a bitcoin transaction back to a person they would have no problem extending their suspect list to everyone involved.  It's just extra data to deal with and if you end up tracing back to a few hundred (or a few thousand) exchange accounts then they've just narrowed their search down considerably.  Before starting they didn't have any names and now they do and the rest is good old detective work.
Lastly it's also possible to muddy the trail further by trading between different cryptocurrencies.  Some of the exchanges dealing say Dodgecoin, Primecoin, Asscoin, Mycoin, Coincoin get away with not requiring ID checks (for now) since they do not deal with fiat.  All these currencies have their own blockchain though so the record is still there though some do try and have anon features (eg Darkcoin) so this could be a valid route.  You could also burn your trail by hacking and taking down these smaller exchanges.  Their record keeping might not be the same as a larger exchange and if their security is lax records can be deleted :)
Well if you think I've missed a scenerio let me know but I think that's all bases I know of covered.
If I really wanted to move $$ from the US to Turkey (to say fund IS) I would do this...
*  Exchange $$ for Euros in 500 euro notes (for your "holiday")
* Repeat untill you reach the desired amount
* Insert the notes into a disguised envelope and mail to Turkey
The postable service might take a few days but it pretty reliable and if you keep the amounts low (say 20 notes per mailing) then it's still an envelope and not a package plus it keeps your risk low.  You've also just moved several thousand dollars between countries for no fees (bar postage) and completely anonymously.
Basically anonymous cash is waaayyyy easier and less hassle than attempting anonymous bitcoin.  Even with all the training and resouces any organisation is much more likely to stick what they know and avoid bitcoin.  
Once you balance cost vs end result money laundering with fiat is simply easier, cheaper and more anonymous than with bitcoin.
Edit :  I hope this doesn't come across as confrontational or patronising, this isn't intended.  Basically my counter argument is a detailed analysis :)

well highest bidder in this case is more like biggest investor since you spend the money and later find out if you got the outcome you wanted.
If you think of it in terms of investment then then the miners should have more of a say since they've invested their time, resouces and money into the network. It's the investment of the miners in hardware which pushes up the difficulty making it hard to get a 51% attack. Businesses are on the line here which are solely dependant on Bitcoin suceeding.
Sure other business have been established too and have had VC backing but 99% of them could survive the death of Bitcoin and move into "blockchain" tech.  Many of them already have a toe in the water or actively also provide consulting services.
@_date: 2016-04-29 09:46:50
I've tried discussing this sort of thing a few times but I've never felt like I've gotten any clear answers.  However this is the rough understanding I've reached :


As far as I understand ideally **every transaction** should be in Segwit format to get the maxium benefit (avg 75% "saving/discount").  In Segwit v1 this is to move the script element of the transaction into the OP_RETURN part of the transaction.


As far as I know no more than point 1.


Yes probably, they would save fees here.  Particually large transactions with a complex script and/or many inputs and outputs will have the greatest saving (this is also why Segwit benefits Lightning).


Technically yes but I doubt this would be noticable to the average user since fees in the few cents range are not normally seen as a big deal anyway (so a few cent saving is trivial).  Companies which provide a service which requires a high volume of transactions would see a much more noticeable benefit.


This isn't fixed, as far as I know it's an estimate based on the size of an average transaction (&amp; it's cost) vs the size of a Segwit formatted transaction.  The estimate is that a typical transaction would be 75% smaller and would need a fee to be 75% less than before (cost per Byte pricing).


Not that I have seen so far and I've asked lots.  There have been very general statements but nobody seems to be able to run any meaning full analysis.  It's not like the data isn't there either, we know what transactions typically move through the system on a daily basis so surely it's possible to model.  I'd have a go myself but I don't think I have the deep technical know-how or frankly the time (day job demands).

As far as I know segwit doesn't "activate".
Once the changes have been rolled out transactions are either created in the traditional format or the segwit format.  I think the suggestion here is that there might be some problems if not all the miners upgrade.
There is an additional change on the cards for 2017 (needing a hard fork) which forces the whole network to the segwit format and I think this might be what you are referring to.
@_date: 2016-04-10 05:18:48
Well I've tried doing some additional research but came across this thread below on bitcointalk.  
The net result is I'm pretty disenchanted now and I'm going to metaphorically walk away from bitcoin (and segwit) and come back later.
As a final thought (for today) I could be wrong but I think you'll find it very difficult migrating the network to segwit and it's possible that it might fail, stuck with a partial rollout.  The implications of that are "not nice" and could dwarf any block size debate.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:21:59
I'm pretty certain I saw something that explicitly stated a hard fork would be needed but I can't seem to find it.  Googling "bitcoin core segwit hard fork" or similar just brings back too much, if I find the article to quote I'll be back :)

After that I don't think he's Satoshi.
I found it especially interesting when asked "what about the early bitcoin" he launches into an agressive push back of "I'm not selling".  He wasn't asked that but it's the sort of thing people with something to hide do when they want to change the narrative.  I think he was actually being asked if he was willing to prove he had the private keys for the early bitcoins and he didn't want to have that discussion.
@_date: 2016-04-13 10:56:05


I think the whole payment network model is a bit idealistic and won't happen in the real world.
Ultimately every day users will (with fiat in hand) want to (hopefully) buy Bitcoin and they will want to join the Lightning network at the same time.  They will purchase said Bitcoin through an exhange or possibly an ATM service.  If that provider also provides the ability to open a channel between the user and themselves then isn't that going to be the easiest route for a new user ?  They'll also gain access to many other users (and their channels) at the same time.
Also should a business want to join in accepting Bitcoin and they are happy to go the Lightning route then they are also very likely to involve an exchange.  Like it or not most business will still have bills to pay in fiat so will want to exchange Bitcoin for $$ at some point and if an exchange offers both this service and access to the Lightning network then it's a one-stop-shop for them.  Since it takes time (blockchain confirmations) they are unlikely to want to open channels with customers directly.
So unless someone can shoot down the above then every day users and business are most likely to access the network via exchanges (mainly due to basic lazyness).  Exchanges will of course have channels open with each other effectivly resulting in every user and business being able to access each other via the exchanges acting as a sort of super-hubs.
Please, if anyone thinks something different would happen let me know.
@_date: 2016-04-13 11:09:17
From the Core Roadmap :










So "Phase 1" is the release coming soon and my understanding is that this will result in a mix of standard transactions and segwit transactions (from the upgraded wallets).
Later (2017 I believe) there is a hard fork planned to enable "Phase 2" after which may also include an increase to the block size limit of 1mb.  After this wallets relying on the old format will not be compatible with the network.
Edit : Sorry for the nested indents, not sure how to fix it.
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:58:56
There might be Fear but there is no uncertainty or doubt.  There have been significant periods recently where the blocks have been full creating a backlog and this is indisputable.
Of course the reason is up for debate :)
@_date: 2016-04-30 07:31:47
Segwit is unproven as a fix for transaction throughput issues and Classic exists partially because Core insisted that Segwit was the magic bullet to solve everything and should come before any block size increase.
If Core prove to be correct about Segwit then I expect Classic support will waiver but this needs time for Segwit to be fully released "live".  If after a few months everything is as Core promised then great (and Classic will go away) but if it looks like Segwit hasn't delivered then expect Classic support to increase.

Nobody split the community, the community has split on its own with (in simple terms) Core at one extreme, Classic at one other extreme and a whole spectrum of varying viewpoints between.
This is the first true test of Satoshi's principles that Bitcoin is driven from longest-chain consensus and an event like this resulting in a two significantly different solutions was always inevitable. So yes it will be interesting to see how this develops and I think this is worthwhile, maybe if we reach a similar impasse in a few years it will be less of a farce lol

I understand your point but there are ways to network and to "succeeded" without being a catalyst for even more strife in the community.

I guess it might work in the short term but in the long run it might not exactly help your reputation.
That said there's been far worse in the last couple of months and some keys issues haven't gone away just yet so there's more to come.  Never a dull moment in Bitcoinland :)
@_date: 2016-04-08 16:29:01
Not really.... the principle behind a hard fork is that say a change affects a basic property of "bitcoin" and then the blocks become incompatible.  There is a version number embeded in each block but having that being different doesn't stop blocks being accepted by the network so it doesn't really deonte different chains.
For example the ever fashionable block size limit :
Lets say implementation A has a limit of 1mb and implementation B has a 2mb limit with them both starting from the same block chain.  When the next block is added if it is a type A block then all nodes based on implementation A will see the block and add it but nodes based on implementation B will see these as invalid.  The same goes for if a block is broadcast of type B, network nodes of type A will reject it and nodes of type B will add it.
In short order the network quickly becomes two distinct networks.  They share the same history but have an ever lengthening difference from the point the fork occurred and neither set of nodes will reconise the others "highest block height" has valid.

Having slept on this conversation I've decided that attempting to engage with you isn't a constructive use of my time and is ultimately fruitless bordering on wasteful.  I might change my mind in time but this is where I stand today.

@_date: 2016-04-11 11:23:05


Why not ?
It's just data anyway and this could have been projected any time after the transaction format was specified.
For example using a full node it's possible to cache a large batch of memepool transactions.  Projections can then be run to analyse how these transactions would be added to the blockchain in various scenarios.
I would suggest :
* Current ideal world, every block full
* Segwit ideal world, every transaction is SegWit, every block is full
* Partial rollout, 25% SegWit, 75% "old"
* Close rollout, 75% SegWit, 25% "old"
From this you could project network utilisation and transaction throughput in each scenario which while still only a projection would be quite meaningful (more than we have now).
There are a couple of catches with this of course, assumptions would have to be made on a sort order (simple by date or fee?). Also do you keep it super simple (&amp; easy) and assume all transactions arrives at the same time or do you spread them out over their arrival time.

To be honest I'm speaking 3rd or 4th hand so I'm not sure how this works in practice but I understand some need ID to be scanned and often take a photo of the user as well.  I think there are still some with no checks but better to be fore-warned just in case.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:27:17


Owch, harsh lol..... it is possible I made an incorrect assumption you know.  Some of those people certainly act like they around in the early days but clearly it's more like the initial developers have almost totally been replaced.  No wonder they don't share the old vision.
(I have only been around 3 years so I apologise for not having being around for longer.  Genuinely, there's many a day dream where I wished I could have bought Bitcoin for less than an dollar)
@_date: 2016-04-08 09:36:55
Based on past experience I would guestimate that at the moment purchases of a few thousand bitcoins say half hourly would move the price by around $20 every half an hour.
However this wouldn't last long (maybe a couple of hours) before price notifications get triggered (probably above $450 ish) and more regular traders pile in.  After this it becomes harder to predict since it depends on if people think the rise will continue (so the big guys buy feeding the rise) or if people think this is a quick spike they can sell into for a quick $50/bitcoin profit (probaly pushing the price lower than where it started).
No exchange would sell out.  As bitcoins are bought the price pushes up and more people become interested in selling feeding the purchases. Eventualy this will even out naturally as the price pushes above the maximum people are prepared to pay.  For example if the $ price goes from $420 to $4200 in 7 days (rocket to the MOON !!) most people would be too wary to buy at that peak and would conclude that the price is likely to crash and they could buy at a lower price (say $2000 ?) at a later date.  
A quick price rise is like a thrown ball straight up, sooner or later it looses momentum and drops back down.... traders/inventors just hope that it doesn't drop lower than there it started  :)

@_date: 2016-04-29 11:09:34
Yes it is. 
I think you are mistaking the current implementation with Segwit v2 which requires a hard fork to implement :


@_date: 2016-04-08 16:04:09
Reply in short.... yes it's possible to change this in bitcoin and yes it would need a hard fork to implement and it would be technically an simple change.  
In practical terms however the impact of the change would be far reaching since this is a basic fundamental property and would probably require code changes to every wallet using bitcoin.
Edit... 
Simple as in : After block height X all transaction amounts are held with the decimal point moved to the left 3 places and values earlier than that block height are considered to be amount * 1000
Far reaching as in :  This breaks a fundamental assumption and any wallet which doesn't account for this (even if they follow the HF) will see all these transactions (above block height X) as 1000 times smaller than before.
In conclusion pretty unlikely to be seriously considered and as someone else has pointed out if we reach a point where 0.00000001 BTC is worth 1 cent then 1 BTC is $1,000,000 and we're (unfortunately) a long way away from that, maybe in a few decades.

It would be great if we could have some hard facts at this point.... particularly around SegWit which is in testing now.  As a case in point :


It's very hard to sell a solution on "could", how about something more tangible ?  While I'm at it "almost double" isn't the same as "double" and this also **not helping** and should be more tangible too.


Same issues.... Could ?  Almost double ?


Ok.... we have a "possible", an "around", two "could" and an "almost"..... probably the most uncertain sentence I've ever seen !


If you take a measure of how likely something is to happen from how confident someone is in their pitch then your pitch (which is confident of nothing) suggests that this is very VERY unlikely and you probably don't believe it yourself.
@_date: 2016-04-29 11:59:49
There is two parts to this, the change to the transaction format and the change to if the if witness data is counted in the block size or not.
If Segwit was rolled out without the 2nd change there would be no discount or space saving since the transactions would be actually very slightly biigger (by a few Bytes) but it would still work.
So no, the change for the discount is not necessary segwit in isolation.  
It is however necessary for segwit to return a capacity benefit in it's current form.

@_date: 2016-04-15 10:18:54
Sort of.
The total amount of available Bitcoin is continuously increasing with each new block.  However this feed of new money decreases gradually to 0 after 21 million have been created.
Since only 21 million will ever be created in theory if someone losses the private key to a wallet of thosewise looses access to BTC then the total available decreases.  Mostly this is more than balanced out by the new income so anything like this has to be massive to have an effect of the exchange rate to Fiat (probably 100,000+).
For example it is understood that Satoshi has owned the keys for roughly 1 million BTC (maybe more, I'm quoting old analysis).  It's not known if he/she still have the private keys or not but if this was definately confirmed either way then I think this would have an effect.
The theoretical question is a bit invalid since you would have to wait untill all 21 million BTC have been issued, find a way to buy them all and then destroy it. I say invalid because it's near to impossible that you could buy ALL the bitcoin and if you did then bitcoin would ultimately have no value to anyone else.  You can try this today by creating you own bitcoin cloned alt coin, pre-mining all 21 million and establishing value by trying to sell them.  You probably won't get any buyers so the value is $0 and if you drestroy them you kill something nobody was using (or could use).
Anyway I think that got a bit long winded so more simply lets say you manage to destroy 10.5 million BTC then the price would roughly double.  It's worse than burning money though (since there won't magically be more) so akin to personal economic self destruction.

Point being I don't think someone who changes 2 or 3 lines of code (or only submits code which is rejected) isn't going to be as important as someone who has submitted 1,000s.  I don't mean to any disrespect to them but some people just contribute more with a greater level of knowledge and experience and as a result have a louder voice.
The core release notes for 0.12 credits 94 people but I'm fairly confident that less than a dozen of those contributed 80% of the code changes and an even smaller number of key personalities have a significant sway over which changes are seen as "good" or "bad".  There might be peer review but unfortunately not all "peers" are equal (and that's all ignoring who has commit rights).
@_date: 2016-04-15 09:59:43
Just sit and wait..... if someone really wants their money back their best option is to send you an additional transaction from one of the orignating addresses with "Sorry, messed up.  Please can you sent the 3 BTC back ?".
In the mean time it's extremely unlikely your private key is compromised but you could create a new address and move funds there just in case.  It's not especially important which provider you use (blockchain.info has a bad rep in some circles but it's mostly FUD) but you only need to think about firing up an all singing &amp; dancing full node if you're feeling super paranoid and there's alot of BTC at stake.

How is this in any way realistic test prior to release ?
(assuming that on release initially say 10% of transactions will be segwit compliant with this increasing in as companies roll it out)
Is a network of mixed segwit and "standard" transactions going to be tested as well ?

Nope sorry, you've lost me there.
The increases in CPU speed, RAM capacity and storage capacity in computing happened without any artificial limits purely as technology evolved and as more complex engineering methods became cost-effective.  Bitcoin has no relation this partly due to the current fixed block limit and partly due to the development monopoly.  If AMD and Intel hadn't had to compete I doubt we'd have the low nm, multicore processors we have today.  No criticism meant here, I just think the ecosystems and too different to be comparable. 
Everyone is an extremist to someone :)

What's to stop this from happening ?
* Person A and B create a channel
* Person A and B transact some
* Person A signs and broadcasts the "old balance-sheet"
* Person A immediately signs the bounty and broadcasts the "anti-cheat"
This is probably not worth trying between two people but what if someone hacks a large node (Starbucks ?) and gains access to the "old balance-sheets" for many users.  They could broadcast all these and collect the bounty en-mass for 1000s of channels/users.

Sure and I would too since at that stage the chain will have split into Bitcoin Core Coin and Bitcoin Classic Coin (with probably each side calling the other an alt).  Anyone with any BTC holdings would have a value duplicated in both so why not run a SHA3 Bitcoin Core Coin.
I think the main issue would be which coin took the most merchants with it and which kept the same value as "old Bitcoin" from before the fork.  This will help decide which is worth $10 and which is worth $100 (made up numbers just to make a point).

He turned down the title of "Leader Maintainer" to be "Chief Scientist" instead so you're basically suggesting someone Satoshi thought could replace him is being self important with a lesser title than he could have had ?
You either didn't think that through, don't know much about how we got here or are just throwing things around to be insulting.
@_date: 2016-04-09 20:25:40
Massive, not least because Satoshi may have control over millions of bitcoin mined in the early days.
Should he/she start selling those coins then that's a large amount of bitcoin which have been generally considered "off market/inaccessible" suddenly on the market.  Even if Satoshi only starts to move/sell 1% to say build up a family trust fund (a noble choice) traders could see this as a trickle before a flood and start selling their bitcoin "just in case" which could start a tumble down.
So in summary.....
* A "Satoshi" appears
* Convincing proof is provided (just convincing - might not be genuine)
* Questions are asked about the historic bitcoin stash
* Traders start to get nervous about the stability of the current price
* Trading starts to tumble
* Trading bombs down as ever nervous/speculative traders sell too
* Wait till you think the "bottom" is hit
* BUY
* Evidence emerges that the proof above isn't real
* People quickly realise this "Satoshi" is fake
* Traders pile back in as everyone claims to also not have been convinced
* Profit
Faked convincing proof in this example would be the movement of virgin very early days bitcoin.  A block of 50 reward earned early enough for someone to claim it is controlled by Satoshi.  However at that point there were probably only half a dozen people mining so this relies on those people not having moved coins AND being willing to give someone the private key to a block reward knowing what they could do with it.
There's other ways too, like back dating evidence but really people want to see movement of Satoshi mined coins or a PGP Satoshi signed message.  I'd add a message from a Satoshi controlled email account but many of these have been hacked and are no longer trusted.
@_date: 2016-04-12 16:49:42
Very well written but when touching on miners is missed a point.
Yes miner earnings will be reduced (affecting paying their bills) but last year Bitcoin spent a long time around $230 so this price point has been tested already and not that long ago.
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:21:20
Why ?  Because they'll be getting less fiat per block ?
Last year Bitcoin was around $230 for months and there was no problem and half of $420 would be $210 so no big deal.  Maybe some miners with tight margins will switch off while the price rises (it did with the last halfening) but the difficulty will adjust and Bitcoin carries on.
@_date: 2016-04-10 03:23:38
Surely space is saved within the main transaction block (the bit limited to 1mb) since the script element of the transaction has been moved to a separate space in the data structure ?
I'm starting to think you're being deliberately obstructive to what started as a fairly uncomplicated question.
If there is a testnet then there is testing happening.  Many people will be taking an interest in the tests performed, testing methodology and test results.  It's in your interests to show hard evidence of the benefits from segwit since so far this has just been words backed with theoretical calculations.  Nothing beats hard data though.
It's a chance to back this up with testing evidence :


@_date: 2016-04-13 10:20:30
This is true and I would expect that as the day approaches those miners with tight margins might switch off their rigs for a few weeks while the dust settles.  The difficulty will adjust and drop to follow.
All this is just speculation though, the situation is very different to the drop from 50 to 25 BTC and nobody really knows how the next 6 months will work out.
@_date: 2016-04-09 14:33:41
Ok good.... does that show what level of space-saving is expected on roll out ?
It should also be possible to project and plot the expected space-saving against adoption level.  It would be very useful to the discussion in general to see this.

I was specifically talking about block space since this was within the context of a equivalent 1.5mb block on the test network.

To be fair I just checked looking for a quote and couldn't find one.  Luke's issue around spam seems to be mainly around use of OP_RETURN to hold additional data, especially on low value transactions.
There has however been a general campaign against 0-conf transactions with RBF meaning they could be re-directed but this is an attack unlikely to be used against a food stall so fairly safe.
Personally I'm all for network neutrality, every transaction is equal as long as they pay a fee.  Miners are likely to process a higher fee transactions before a low fee transaction but that's it.

Good example of a bad user experience.  Blockchain should probably have better error messages.  They present a user friendly interface but then have an error message which expects the user to know what "outputs" are. A better message would be "Waiting for pending transaction" with a link to the unconfirmed transaction.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:43:25
Well how could you keep it ?  If you make any move to spend it the market will tank immediately and the trade itself might identify you. So then you are faced with being identified, known to own a massive amount in bitcoin and at worst case a target for the "bad guys" with your creation nose-diving.
Ultimately in attempting to spend those early bitcoin Satoshi could undo bitcoin itself though I admit that's pretty much worse case scenario.

Can someone help with how I explain Lightning to the average man in the street ?  For example my retired parents, they "get" the block chain as a chain of blocks of data containing transactions and this means there is a proveable transaction history. They also "get" that the network is global so bitcoin can be sent to anyone and it's authenticed once a block is processed by the network.
Frankly though I don't think I get this Lightning and how these channels work other than you're moving bitcoin around that hasn't properly been submitted to the blockchain yet (which goes against allot of what I have told them so far). So can someone explain this to me in a way I can explain it to them ?  Ideally avoiding the word "channel" since it would help to not need to explain a new term.

Consider using  to get your bitcoins.
Via this method people with bitcoin to spend are looking for goods from Amazon at a discount and as someone with $$$ and wanting bitcoin you can help. The discount to them translates to a cost to you of course, anything from 5% up to 40% but it's your choice.
This steps around the KYC requirement for Australia since you're buying goods from Amazon (via someone's wish list) not bitcoin.  On delivery purse will release to you the agreed amount in bitcoin (held in Escrow) and there are no requirements for your photo or passport details.
As other people have pointed out it also helps to move your bitcoin through various exchanges.  Many allow you to deposit/transact/withdraw small amounts without any KYC checks and this might suit you.

It's a good idea but I can see a problem with working out where to get the cut off block number.  Too early and there might not be a big enough % of the blocks included to help.  To high and you risk including someone else's unspent bitcoin as well (pro holding though).

Back when China was talking about a bitcoin ban the price dropped at the tinest sniff of news and ultimately it wasn't even a full ban and the Chinese exchanges are still going today.
If those old coins start to move I believe you'd see a large % drop immediately with further drops if they eneded up on an exchange and/or contined to move.  The market doesn't move with the news as much as it used to but it depends how big the news is.

Well on set-wit rollout day obsiously there will be a new release of Core which I assume will have been static during a testing period giving people a chance to prepare upgrades in advance.  Are there any esimates on how many early-adoptors there will be ?  Just a rough % of new transactions would be nice to see.


I'm not sure I understand this so this could be my ignorance of the additional seg-wit benefits besides the space saving..... but surely you need to encourage everyone to upgrade regardless of if this need seg-wit or not to feel the extra 0.7 Mb benefit ?
By "everyone" here I mean every piece of software adding new transactions to the network.

According to  in the last 24 hours transactions with the default fee took between 70-540 minutes to process.  You need to pay 5x the default fee to definately make the next block.
The lower bar is the last 24 hours of blocks and the top bar is the backlog.
*Edit : Actually on second thoughts I'd forgotten to account for transaction size but the point still remains that default fee transactions do not complete for hours at the moment*

Users can be generally said to be making transactions move money between wallets (so generally), making payments online, making payments via mobile, making deposits/withdrawls to exchanges and probably some other scenarios I've missed.

I think regarding 0-conf transactions this is akin to how credit card payments operate.  
With every card payment there is an accepted level of risk of fraud (eg stolen card details) and this stands at roughly 0.1% of all card transactions (wikipedia). So an initial card payment is checked and authorised by the store &amp; the card company but might later prove to be fraudulent.
Up to a couple of years ago stores could (&amp; did) treat 0-conf transactions in a similar way. Having them show on the mem pool was proof enough to give someone that coffee on the spot.  There was a level of risk that the transaction might not make it into a block but the risk level was low enough that it was acceptable (much lower than card payments).  That said I'm not sure many companies would have accepted this risk level for a $20,000 transaction !
However the advent of RBF broke this for many merchants since this actively placed in the hands of users the ability to re-route a payment while a transaction is still in the mem pool.  By paying a higher fee you can get your money back and that coffee costs the price of the higher fee you just paid.

I was going to mention that merging in seg-wit later would be difficult but I wanted to keep the comment short.  From my limited understanding the seg-wit changes are 100s of lines of code and from experience I can say that this would definately be non-trivial though this depends on if the Classic guys have made their own changes which could conflict.  
I think this is understood at the Classic side too which is why they would rather have the seg-wit developers add their changes to Classic themselves when done.  The essential truth here though is that for Classic seg-wit is not a prioity.

Only in Chain A in this case since it then becomes pretty much useless.  This is compounded if more miners move, 10% of hash power means 10x longer to process the blocks and 10x longer till the recalc, 200 days !!
I'm pretty certain this will have been considered, it's just not being talked about.  Not in public anyway but I bet there's some tough negotiations going on behind the scenes with the miners.
You see Satoshi's version of "consensus" is the longest valid chain, driven by the miners and the hashing power no matter if other people might try and redefine "consensus" for their own purposes.  Bitcoin, a self governing and decentralised system enshried in the basic building blocks (lol) of the system itself.  Thanks Satoshi !

Excellent, this is the first sign of sanity and much better than someone else's reactionary reply on the same question  ;)
I see a fundamental communication issue here you see.  Many people in the community are technical types (in that I include everyone with a technical/analyitical background not just coding) and we like to deal with as close to absolutes as possible.  Reassurances that "everthing will be fine with this special sauce" don't hold much water on their own and need to be backed up with analysis and figures people can believe in.
I believe this is much of the problem with Classic vs Core.  The core seg-wit promises while beging a SF don't (currently) have much analitical backing but the Classic solution is a HF but it will definately being extra capacity.  This leaves everyong weighing up the safe but unproven Core option vs the more dangerous but proven Classic option.
Anyway it will be intersting to see and I doubt any analysis will happen, it's time consuming to do anyway and it needs more than just a commitment from companies.  You need to know their estimates deployment dates as well as how much transaction volume they generate.
Also this reply is also probably so buried into the thread nobody else will read this lol

I'm not disupting that hashcash (or the concepts used) wasn't necessary for Bitcoin.
I'm pointing out that hashcash was never primarily intended to be used for a decentralized cryptocurrency and it wasn't Adam that implemented this.  
On this basis I don't personally believe that this justifies the "large voice" that Adam seems to command.  I also object to any suggestion that Satoshi couldn't have invented Bitcoin without Adam, especially since I think Adam has encouraged this to his own benefit. The cult of personality is easily manipulated.

Checking the conversation after the above posts this guy talks alot of sense to me :




Though I don't think it's a case that Classic is doing a better job, just the Core (&amp; supporters) are doing a terrible job.  I don't think I need to go into why but I think I can say that general community sentiment is against Core and as a result other options are being looked for.  All the Classic guys have to do is make clear promises and stick to them (basically not f*** up).
These comments though speak of the centralisation present within Core as I believe this references the Core developers working in paid development roles with a VC backed budget (*cough*). I'm personally in favour of a development team which is de-centralised and not dominated by any organisation.




What follows after this is a long conversation on how to promote Core and how Classic is acting as a challenger.
I think personally that the Core team/camp isn't really listing to the message here.  There are significant changes in the pipe-line (seg-wit) and already happening (RBF) which many people disagree with for a varity of reasons.  
In response to this post below I would like to say that for these people "Classic" is the status-quo and "Core" is too much change too quickly.

Well unless someone upgrades this Blackberry App then it won't be useable after the seg-wit rollout.  There is no obvious place to change the fee and the default looks to be 0.0001
Guess someone thought that would be a safe default and didn't expect 2016's issues.
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:55:59
This isn't relevant as every miner could upgrade to seg-wit but if the programs adding new transactions do not then there is no capacity gain.
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:42:01


It's something nobody really wants to talk about, the elephant in the room unfortunately.
I agree but at a more extreme level, I think as soon as a hard-fork happens with 75% or more of the mining power then the old chain is dead.  Miners will face a choice of staying with the old chain with drastically slower block times or moving to the new chain with slightly slower block times.  If 90% of the mining power moves then the old chain will be 10x slower and take 10x longer to reach a difficulty recalc while the new chain will be just slightly slower with a recalc taking say just an extra day or two.  I don't think in this scenario anyone will stay with the old chain and I don't think those coins will be spendable anywhere (initially due to the block speed, later due to lack of support).

@_date: 2016-03-02 14:42:23
Well that's a bit more radical than I was thinking plus I was in the near-term, say less than 5 years.
The point being IF bitcoin is used by the banks it will just be as a tool to move fiat value and to prop up their existing systems.  They will then likely switch to their own tool as soon as they can reach a mutual agreement (which with banks being banks will probably take a few years) and will enable reverseable payments, the freezing of accounts etc. they like to have already.  Words like "leveraging the blockchain" will be used.

Well in this case blockchain.info provide wallets to indvidual users so the people you're saying "tough shit" to aren't businesses but every day you and me who will be paying the fees.
Every business you say "tough shit" to is one less busniess working with bitcoin and one less moving money with bitcoin.  That means less demand along with the lower useage and probably quite alot of bad press as all those "tough shit" companies fail taking their VC funding with them. Do you think more VC funding will follow when all those "tough shit" companies have died ?  Not likely. They'll probably just say "bitcoin had it's chance, tough shit".

The 1.7Mb bump is only valid if every transaction submitted uses seg-wit....


.... so since it is likely the uptake of seg-wit could be slow I suspect reaching 100% (or even 50%) seg-wit utilisation (with the associated capacity benefits) could take some time.
Are you aware if anyone has done any work to forecast this timescale and if so are there any estimates ?

I've had a dig through the history and from the begining :
(condensed to remove off-topic comments)


















So far so good, some agreement here :)




Starting to go wrong now, looks to me like a push for "Classic" to include seg-wit




Which doesn't go down well










However there looks to be an attempt at a compromise






Since (I think) Classic have stated any release will be without seg-wit code then I guess this probably didn't go down well since for Classic this would be "later" in the to do list.








Sounds nice and simple but forgets the politics. I wonder how happy those seg-wit developers would be about finishing it in "Core" and then "Classic" just merging it into their competing solution.










Here another push of the "Core" agenga vs the "Classic" agenda.




Quickly pushed back too

Mining requires an investment of millions of dollars and pays out in Bitcoin gradually over time. So an investment with a large up front cost and a gradual pay out sounds like the long haul to me.

Not my figures, these are figures from Gregory Maxwell (nullc) :


This is based on everyone upgrading, the 2mb number just gets knocked around since that way it sounds comparable to a 2mb block size.
@_date: 2016-03-07 10:56:29
No, it's a space saving depending on how much the "script" bit of the transaction takes up.  The average has been guesstimated to be about a 60% space saving (not sure who by the the figures are from Core).
Also this is dependant on the systems (wallets/exchanges/merchants/etc) which create transactions upgrading to SegWit.  I've seem something somewhere that the blockchain.info wallet is responsible for something like 40% of the traffic so if for example they are against SegWit then that's a potential space saving lost.

@_date: 2016-03-07 16:34:20
No, quite the opposite.  Less change is better.
Many businesses have been setup around bitcoin, I've watched them many of them announce millions in VC funding over the last couple of years but the ecosystem is changing under their feet.  For example when BitPay started there was no block limits and no 2nd layer under discussion, the network operated very closely to the initial whitepaper and THIS is what (most) VC's will have been sold.  However fast-forwarding 2 years sees a very different situation with the network congested, talk of fees being priced as appropiate, trouble for 0 conf transactions, 2nd chain solutions etc.
As for future VC funding it's a risky business and bitcoin is a risky prospect for VC's so when looking at a business they'll need reassuring that the network isn't going to change adversly in the next few years.  At the moment I think they'll take alot of reassuring.
Edit : To expand on this I did a bit of digging....
**VC funding for $2mill and above for the last 3 months**


"Simplex provides Bitcoin exchanges, broker websites and wallet applications with a safe, fraud-free, and fully protected platform for selling Bitcoins online via credit card transactions, thus creating a safer environment for the customer." 


"Blockstream’s core area of innovation is sidechains, a technology focused on improving on the blockchain, the most powerful public utility for distributed trust systems."


"Digital Asset builds distributed, encrypted straight through processing tools. Our technology improves efficiency, security, compliance and settlement speed."


"Gem refines blockchain technology to power smart networks that connect industries."


"Blockchain remittance middleware and infra provider for financial service providers"


"No fee wire transfers for small business to pay and receive, domestic and international. Same day money transfer, full tracking, sign up in seconds."
So there are a number of "Blockchain" companies in here who are using the tech but not Bitcoin.  Also there are some "services" type compaines (eg Simplex) who might be pitching services but aren't directly reliant on the Bitcoin Blockchain. If you eliminate these you are reduced down to :




The November deal is quite old now but so far in 2016 the Blockstream deal is the ONLY heavily bitcoin dependant company who have bagged any significant VC funding in 2016.  I'm sure they were able to adequately reassure investors that they could anticipate the future direction of the bitcoin network protocol.

I have the Bitcoin App on Blackberry.  When will this support seg-wit ?  In fact when would this be updated after a hard fork ?  Probably I'm best moving my bitcoin off it before a HF to a web wallet but in the seg-wit case old apps could be generating old style transactions for years after the seg-wit rollout.

A very good point and the mining/hash power issue is something I have posted about myself.
However I don't see much chance of a reoncillation between the Core developers and other now multiple offerings which offer a larger block size.  I do see that the Core adveraries might collaborate and I'm interested to see how this progresses.  I believe this because I think the Core developers are too committed to holding the current block size and pushing the Lightning Network forward.

Sure, why not since many of the BU developers are former Core developers.  There didn't suddenly decide to stop building android apps to work on BU, they were bitcoin developers already who forked Core to create BU.

I've thought about it but I'm making more trading USD vs BTC and I don't want to lock up any of my trading balance in BTU.
You could however pitch that the HitBTC price is a 1 in 10 bet that BU will fork, be the dominate fork and regain the current price. So who wants to gamble 1 BTC for a chance of gaining 10 BTC ? There might be more takers if the BU block count increases.

I don't see a problem.
I read the [Level 2] scenario as where the fork is imminent since the action of orphaning blocks is basically creating a fork. It doesn't help however that no time scale is implied, just the "possibility" as BU gains majority support.
The [Level 3] scenario is a bit of a dirty trick but does add the replay protection all be it at the expense of the minority chain. I don't doubt that were roles reversed core would consider this to be a valid action.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:34:48
Yeah I accept the same protocol is used but my point there is that if the wider world is looking for "Accepts Lightning" then the "Bitcoin" label will fall out of use and will be replaced with simply "Lightning".

@_date: 2017-03-13 11:37:40
BU has no hard-coded blocksize and miners decide the optimal blocksize between themselves. Ideally something which keeps the backlog under control and keeps fees reasonable (high enough to be profitable, low enough to encourage high useage).
The reasoning being that the miners are best placed to balance high useage/low fees and low useage/high fees.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:30:04
There's also basic human trust to consider too, especially considering that your average consumer isn't going to have a clue how everything technically works.
At the moment they are used to trusting big companies, they won't think to monitor a channel with a large exchange even if they knew how. They will then be more than happy to see payments go through the node run by the exchange.
Imagine this between a customer and a merchant :
* C : Hey, I see you accept Lightning !
* M : Sure we do :)
* C : Ok so can I pay for this Coffee please ?
* M : No problem. Do you have a channel open with us ?
* C : A what ?
* M : A Lightning payment channel. You might if you bought from us before.
* C : But I'm just here for the weekend. I have a Lightning wallet with Coinbase. Can't I just pay with that ?
* M : Sure but you need to open a channel first.  There's also a 10 to 20 minute wait but that's out of our hands. We also accept Bitcoin but the fee is actually more than your Coffee so it's probably not worth it.
* C : Bitwhat ? Are you sure I can't just pay with Coinbase ? They're a really big company and you say you accept Lightning.
* M : Well hang on I do have another wallet but I don't like to use it. Here, this wallet accepts Lightning via Coinbase so you can pay this way.
* C : Well why didn't you say before ?
Customers pays, take coffee muttering about if this new fangled tech is worth it and the merchant decides it probably isn't worth asking people to open channels and via the exchange is probably fine.

It's worth noting that hashcash isn't really named properly, it should be more like hashcache.
Go read the whitepaper : 
I think you'll find like I did that hashcash was designed as a traffic management tool to throttle use of serivces like usenet and email.  It's use for e-money is literally an afterthought, the last bullet on a list of uses and even that references someone else's work...












So yes hashcash might have been useful to Satoshi but I think personally that "instrumental" is too strong a word as it's a small part of a much bigger picture. Satoshi's whitepaper pulls together many pre-existing elements in a way nobody else had thought to before.  If you're going to credit people as "instrumental" then you should probably credit Phil Zimmermann first since he invented PGP or Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn who invented TCP.

@_date: 2016-01-19 15:57:24
In all this talk about forks I don't see much discussion around the hash difficulty issue.  Surely in this case if the chain split into two forks with an even amount of mining power each (perfect world) then wouldn't the currenlt difficulty targeted at 1 block every 10 minutes mean that 1 block would take 20 minutes until the next recalc ? Wouldn't a network running at half usual speed be a problem ?
Taking this further this means then that if you have the support of the majority of miners the most cut-throat time to fork would be right after a recalc.  
In this example you have 75% of mining power and the original chain A would be left with 25% with blocks taking 4x longer than normal (on average). Your new fork (B) is going to be slower than normal but not by much, 1.5x but still manageable.  If pre-fork the difficulty recalc is due in say 20 days then your new chain B would solve blocks on average every 15 minutes with a recalc in 30 days.  The old chain A though would solve blocks on average every 40 minutes with a recalc in 80 days which I would say is not workable resulting in a dead chain &amp; user exodus.
I guess what I'm getting at is don't the miners have the power here ?  Getting the hash power is key.
If I have seriously misunderstood something here please let me know ! Every day in bitcoin is a learning process :)

Yes, I can ask you and then decide if you are telling the truth and if you might actually have that breakfast the next day.
It can be done today.  The essential steps would be to confirm with every company who plan to deploy seg-wit how long after rollout they expect to have their software upgraded.  Any software company should be able to give an estimate even if it's to the week level with a large contigency.  
With an additional estimate of how much traffic each company generates you can get a very basic forecast.

So in some future dispute the US decides to enforce a financial/technological embargo against russia, china or say north korea then you're telling me this won't be used ? 
It would be so easy with your change in place, nodes are simply told to ignore any north korean blocks as to do anything else would be funding the regime. Any nodes accepting these blocks would be chased for prosecution with the Feds tracing IP addresses and knocking on doors. Companies accepting these blocks would lose banking licences and be barred from the US financial network.
So there you go, as soon as you add the ability to exclude a group from the network because they are doing something you don't like then precedent has been set and it can be used again.

No ordinary user is going to want to run a full verifying node, they won't want the hassle.
Nobody is suggesting that Bitcoin should handle every $2 transaction globally, some people will always like fiat be it paper cash or a goverment blockchain. It should be able to handle $2 transactions *now* while the network is still in it's infancy.
Layer 2 solutions may be the way forward but I've not seen a magic bullet yet.  I'm not a fan of lightning and I think it may result in [a very centralised network.](
Deriving "most users" from the node count isn't very logical since it's easy for one person to run many nodes, potentially hundreds using AWS, virtualisation etc.
I'm not sure about multiple chains lol, maybe drop that into the dev mailing list and see what people say.
I don't want a Bitcoin that prices people out just because they only want to move a few hundred dollars and not a few thousand.  
How about the more users you have the more fees are paid and the more security you get from higher hash power ? Makes sense to me just with a slightly different approach.

Just picking this element out I feel that the current issue with Core isn't just the 1Mb problem.  Some of the Core developers have already said they would be happy to hard fork to 2Mb just not for 6 to 12 months and as the last step in the current road map.  What I see is that people are unhappy with the roadmap changes as much as the delay in increasing the blocksize.  Many people consider that the RBF and seg-wit changes branch off too much from the original vision thet signed up to.  I've been in this since summer 2013 and I'm one.  I'd go as far as saying I think 0 fee transactions should return.
For me Classic is a (small) return to the original vision of a crypto currency for the masses and not some corporate settlement network.  If in future I want to spend bitcoin I want to be looking for the Bitcoin logo and not the logo for the Lightning network or another 2nd layer network.  Transactions fees should also be low enough to not deter the unbanked in the 3rd world and that means high volume to make up enough in fees to pay the miners.  Too idealistic maybe but 20 years in IT have taught me that nothing is impossible it's just some solutions are harder than others.
Edit : Sorry, I might have rambled so to clarify - Far from unchangeable I feel the current Core proposals make future 2017 bitcoin a far different beast to 2015 bitcoin

Yes I've seen that.  I'd ask if anyone has tried to work out what % of network traffic this is but I'm betting not.
So nobody can predict adoption rates of seg-wit but Core have said again and again that seg-wit will bring block capacity up to 2Mb (cough, 1.7Mb) ?  Technically true but on a totally unknown timescale which is a poor job in my opinion.

* Paypal often holds funds before allowing withdrawl
Bitcoin is none of these things be it Core or Unlimited.
There is a price difference too regarding fees but bitcoin fees change and "Paypal fees are expensive" is only true for now.
I'm going to afk for a while now but I might reply later if you don't have me stating the obvious again.
Oh, any thoughts on Lightning or are you not going to try and debunk that Lightning will lead to massively centralised nodes ?

BU does nothing to change the minium fee and 0 fee transactions are not allowed.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:11:34
I expect you're talking about the lag involved with pushing super large blocks around the network in the order of 20Mb and more.
Double capacity is 2Mb blocks and would very quicky clear the backlog we have now.  I doubt we would be filling 20Mb blocks for quite a few years. Longer if transactions are moved into solutions like Lightning so you're suggesting BU is a bad idea now because of the risk of what might happen in many years. Sounds like speculation based on assumption based on speculation.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:46:31
You would think that but when you're talking about a small number of players (&lt; 50) and when they are companies with profits and shareholders to consider things change.  Pretty much why the banks jump when the US (for example) sets an embargo and if they don't they get dragged into court (HSBC).
Maybe I'm being overly pessemistic and everything will work out with centralised hubs. This will be an improvement over the banks but my motivation for the post was to counter people suggesting Lightning will only ever be a de-centralised p2p mesh.

Not always, the miners are aware that fees which are too high will discourage adoption. Bitcoin doesn't operate in isolation and has to complete with a variety of other payments networks from traditional up to and including other blockchain based solutions (alts &amp; private blockchains).
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:51:25
Well when you put it like that ETH sounds fexible (reason aside) and ETC sounds infexible and rigid.
Maybe I was wrong then and there is more in common with Core being like ETC and Unlimited being more like ETH.
I guess it'll all come out in the wash in the end.  If you had 1 chance to check a crystal ball what would you check ?  The price or if the network forked &amp; who won out ?  ;)
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:09:11
If BU originated in China the network would have forked ages ago.  The Chinese miners had to be misled and messed around by core for 12 months before they took any serious interest in BU.
BU destroys nothing, the only major change is the dynamic blocksize change.  It makes me smile every time BU is labeled as buggy when core is touted as 50,000 lines of code better.  Any programmer knows that the more you change the higher the risk of bugs is so Core has a higher chance of being buggy than BU.  Also before someone mentions peer review that's great but again the more lines are changed the higher the chance is that something might be missed and peer review is just someone else reading the code.  That's not deep testing.

\* shrug \* is that "success" ? Sure holders will be happy since they'll be rich(er) but if bitcoin is $50,000 and the fees are $50 then bitcoin will price out many people.
I'd like to be rich but I also got into bitcoin because it would under cut the financial rip off merchants like western union and paypal and enable people to make low cost international payments.  The remittance market is often touted as worth billions but this is mainly because that poor mexican cleaner is being scalped with high fees. "Only $5 to send $50".... who sends $50 ? The dirt poor sending money to their dirt poor parents to buy food. Not usually the people who can afford a 10% transaction tax.

If Coinbase has closed your channel in a tightly regulated and centralised world there's a good chance you won't get to open a channel with someone else.  They won't want your business either.
There's likely to be work arounds but there shouldn't have to be.
Also don't forget the fees to open and close a channel ? They are bitcoin fees and we're passing $1 for ordinary transactions way before lightning is a reality.
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:56:09
Everyone has a bias.  Mine is based on the white paper... you know, for the "electronic payment system".  It's not much of a payment system if the transactions don't go through.
Historically yes, demand has driven usage with has driven the price. This is the first time though that the transaction volume has hit a bottleneck and that changes the rules. From now on demand is driving useage and usage is limited by fees, everyone has an opinion but nobody knows what that will do to the traded $$ value.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:00:30
It's not as simple as an employer/employee relationship. Miners add value to the whole network and can't be fired by those people using the network.  It's more of a cooperation for mutual self interest.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:17:00
Yes, you are correct and if BU forks with 70% of the hash rate after the fork the Core chain will be left with the remaining 30% and will cause a increase in block times etc. At a guesstimate 10 min blocks would become 25 min blocks.
Core have knocked around a few idea of how to counter this..
* Manual difficulty change to restore 10 min blocks
* Change of the Proof Of Work
* Change to Proof Of Stake
All of these options would require an immediate HF.  Any nodes/implmentations left on the original chain would be left out in the cold on neither the latest core chain or the BU chain but they could join in later as their private keys would still work.
@_date: 2017-03-18 11:12:39


That means drastically reduced hash power and reduced security for the whole network. 
@_date: 2016-03-24 17:42:16
Personally if the network was to fork and I was running a full node I'd want to know so I could decide which side of the fork I wanted to be on.  Finding out a few days or a week or two after the countdown started (esp. with a 28 day countdown) could be a huge disaster for a business.
Since it was highlighted the notification would help awareness and it could be argued that a hard fork scenario is something it was designed for.  This would be a "severe network issue" wouldn't it ?

Apologies then, I wasn't clear. My definition of ordinary user is the average guy/gal in the street who doesn't care how things work, just that they do.  The non-tech savvy who only found out about VPNs recently to get access to international TV but doesn't know what it stands for.  I'd label you more like "bitcoin enthusiast" in comparision.
I don't think the node count will decline and we'll stay in the 6,000 range but the types of people running nodes will change to companies and organisations.  As a company if you're going to deal with bitcoin you're going to want to run a full node (or a few).
Sorry, I don't know enough about pegged sidechains to comment.  I'll look into them when I get time.
I've been into Bitcoin since the days of Gox and I'm not ready to abandon it yet for Eth or any other alt.  I still think it's the best chance there is for a global payments network.  Before anybody chips in thats "global" as in globally accepted not handling every transaction over the whole globe !
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:30:16
My argument hinges around two assumptions...
* Bitcoin via Lightning becomes widespread and common, not quite facebook but paypal levels
* Ordinary people in the street will be &gt; 90% of the users
* Ordinary people in the street are lazy as hell (yes chrome, you can save my password)
So these lazy users will use wallets linked to exchanges with probably just 2 or 3 hops between other users.  
Example 1, Bob and Dave are both Coinbase users, 2 hops.  Example 2, Bob buys a coffee from "Beanz" who use Bitpay and Bitpay have a channel open with Coinbase so 3 hops.
Bob never needs to open more than just the channel with Coinbase and the channel might be invisible to him anyway, hidden within the workings of the app.  There might be a need to balance the books (close and re-open the channel) every now and then but that's it. The end result is most Lightning transactions end up routed through the same hubs.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:35:04


Well that rather neatly brings us back around to where we are now since BU is the closest thing we have to a flexcap and Core is sticking with 1Mb. Time will tell I guess !

Ok so via technical language and a veiled insult you're saying that because he writes software to be used by other developers (sorry, "network peers") not end users it doesn't matter that he doesn't use Bitcoin as an end user.
There mere notion that you can develop software at any tier without consideration of the end user is asinine really.. 
Regardless, please don't try and twist the context, my point simply is if you are not using bitcoin on a daily basis then you are not a bitcoin user and you are not using the system.  Thus this makes you "outside the system" looking in. A car designer who does not drive. A bicycle designer who does is not a cyclist. A games designer who does not play games. Etc etc

@_date: 2017-03-07 17:39:23
That sounds good to me, hubs can be routed around and with the general agreement of the network new hubs will form.  However there will still be centralisation and I think we will end up with a network inferior to the basic Bitcoin network.
**Nobody** wants to hear this though, in this sub this has been down voted to 0 and I also posted to the "other" sub at the same time where it's sat at 5 points but no comments at all. Makes it tough to have a discussion lol

Well rightly or wrongly Classic want to hard-fork asap and that means keeping the code changes low risk. Seg-wit might be the best thing since bread came sliced but it is a significant change still in the early stages of testing requiring a fork of it's own to implement.
That said there's been no code released for Classic yet (as far as I know) so there's been no chance for anyone to review what has/hasn't made it in.  I'm expecting it to be more than just the 2Mb blocksize change though. Just not much more.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:57:53
I followed the live feed and it was appreciated but the lack of any detail left me personally frustrated.
I've not seen any feedback to the community published since, have I missed this ?  Are you aware if something is planned ?  
Outside of the inner circle all we are seeing is that some key players met, played some games, took 20 minutes to setup a photo and incidentally talked about some issues and agreed some stuff.  As it stands there is no published agenda or other details on the discussions and any agreements reached.

They are miners, they run massive multi rig operations all day every day, often with custom software.  They live breathe and get paid in bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-18 10:23:59
Someone replying said this :










And that is what non-segwit nodes and miners will see as an unsigned "anyone can spend" transaction. When it comes to a choice between increasing the block space and changing the protocol I'm for a simple block size increase.
Edit : strike through mine to show witness data is ignored by a non-segwit node
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:08:38
Yes there definately is a risk.
I'm not sure how much of a risk at the moment but Bitcoin Unlimited is gaining alot of traction recently.  This may force Core to compromise but given the depth of feeling any compromise at all looks unlikely.
I'm not really sure what would happen yet there are strong opinions everywhere which won't help, expect a degree of chaos at least. Currently the effort to label Bitcoin Unlimited as an alt "BTU" isn't helping since in encourages people to treat this like the eth fork when this is really a different beast. I think this all boils down to control and should it lie with the developers or the miners.

I don't know what this is.  Which roadmap, do you have a link ?


Miners agree a block size via consensus (so 70% vote for 2Mb then 2Mb happens after a delay)


No hard forks is the hardline I've heard recently. A client from years ago should still be able to validate the blocks.


I don't think they want lots of hard forks, the current pitch is just one to implement the dynamic blocksize change.
Well it should be interesting anyway, another one of my reasons for getting into bitcoin was that it was clearly going to be an interesting emerging new tech and I wanted to be in the thick of it rather than watching from the sidelines. Felt like I was late to the party already back in mid 2012 but it's been plenty interesting since.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:46:37
Most of the developers don't even use bitcoin so why should they have a say ?
I do use bitcoin and I think I should have a say but it's hard to be heard.  I just try to argue a logical case.
The miners use bitcoin and have invested millions into mining farms.
If Bitcoin fails the miners have the most to loose, developers will move on and users will find other replacements or will go back to traditional banking. Happily the miners can make their voice heard by with their hash power and many think that BU is the path most likely to suceed and give them a return on their investment.
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:28:50
If your business model of your flagship product is remittance orientated then the increasing fees should be something you pay special interest to and transactions times would also be critical or you may see many disgruntled users.  I hope you've done your due diligence and attempted to project where networks fees could go next and how this affects costs.
I’ve always thought that remittance is bitcoins “killer app” but users are only going to take a chance using bitcoin if the deal is attractive and the transaction quick otherwise they will stick to the tried &amp; tested traditional methods.  This demographic are the sort who can’t risk losing money, either to unreliable services or to fees and they are often going to want to send fairly small amounts. Fixed fees are a problem and “we don’t charge fees” is a nice message but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any.
I think this will only really work in a high fee future if you burry bitcoin behind the scenes so you can consolidate bitcoin payments into bulk batches containing as little distinct keys as possible to save space. If the worker is arriving with bitcoin in hand (not literally obviously) then they will have had to pay a fee to buy the bitcoin and they will need to pay a fee to move them from their wallet.  Better for them to arrive with $$ in hand. 
A few more companies using bitcoin but no new man in the street users is a sad day for bitcoin I think.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:49:41
I heard 1.7 Mb mentioned at the time that everyone rounded up to 2Mb and even then that's if all transactions follow the Segwit format.  Today I don't know, keep hearing all sorts of "effective" block sizes being kicked around anywhere between 2Mb and 4Mb. Everyone seems to *know* what this is but I've not seen many people *agree* what this is. Makes it tough to make an informed opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:19:57


Ok fair enough but it doesn't detract from the main point around Centralisation (see the title).


You've misunderstood, in this example the users will be using an android app or similar service that has Lightning embedded within it. Coinbase have an app, they are likely to extend this to add Lightning rather than create a whole new app.  They are also likely to make it easy to open a channel with Coinbase within the app which will give users access to all other users Coinbase are linked to. Coinbase then becomes a super hub.
If you're fine with super hubs and centralisation then great but this sort of thing is generally what bitcoin is supposed to be replacing not enabling.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:47:29






So by your own admission this would be supported by the majority (there's more "ordinary" people than any other demographic) and bitcoin is driven by a majority consensus. Which ever majority consensus gains the most popular support becomes the chosen solution and this is how Bitcoin is designed.
Bitcoin was never designed to be a fee market.  Transaction **volume** was supposed to replace the block reward, not low volume and high fees.

Yeah it is pretty busy.  I think these numbers are very telling though and a clear message from the bitcoin subreddit.  But will the community be listened to ?
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:49:34
Well I saw "analysis" which interested me and then I saw charts and figures which excited me but it just looks to be skin deep.
The aproximation of "it would be around 2.1MB" in the article just looks to be based on the ratio of p2sh transactions which benefit from the Segwit transaction format. The explanation of how this is calculated says that this is based on an "average transaction profile" with no detail whatsoever. I can stick a wet finger in the air and it'll tell me roughly which way the wind is blowing but I wouldn't call it scientific or accurate.
Since the second half of the article is devoted to screenshots of tweets supporting Segwit I'm sorry but even if 2.1Mb does prove accurate I'm now inclined to write the whole article off as a biased opinion piece.
@_date: 2016-06-07 14:20:57
So Segwit is not in 0.13.0 then ?
I say this because my point is solely that each seperate release (no matter what version it has) shouldn't have too much functional change.  That way it's easier to test yourselves and within the community, you can focus testing on the sole big change plus the bug fixes and minor fixes.  Too much change in one release can be unmanageable.
@_date: 2016-06-24 16:12:50
Entitled to estimated dates ? Well yes, the whole community is.
You use the word "deadlines" twice but I haven't asked for anything like that.  I was merely pointing that there isn't even a hint of time scales (say "this might take a month") in any of the roadmap.
How about you try being a little less defensive ?
@_date: 2016-06-07 17:22:33

@_date: 2017-03-24 09:38:34
Yay way to add security controls to Bitcoin. The goverments and the likes of the SEC are going to love this.  Why not carry on doing their job for them and add the ability to block select mining pools and geographic regions ?
I guess if you can't convince a group to support you then you should just find a way to bully them.
@_date: 2016-06-07 14:12:47
I can't help but think that with this ontop of Segwit there are allot of significant changes all coming at once (all in 0.13.0 ?).  
**Wouldn't it be better to stage this more ?  Say quarterly releases with only one significant enhancement per release (plus minor fixes &amp; bug fixes) sounds less risky and easier to prove in test.  Fixed quarterly targets give the community an expected "due date" for the next release with the only issue being the content.**
At the moment the release date is uncertain (as in it's a target which could move) and the content is uncertain since it's being announced as coding is completed.  Plus some releases are significantly more "feature heavy" than others.  This can't be ideal.
Edit : I shouldn't have mentioned Segwit it seems and that it is a soft-fork is muddying the issue.  I've bolded the actual point of this comment, this is more about fixed, structured &amp; regular releases than it is a specific change (Segwit).
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:34:41
Hey looks like we've found a politician who can't answer a simple point without trying to change the subject.

Depends if you're looking for short term profit or long term profit.
In the short term we might yet see a dip back below $500 within the next 2 or 3 months you could profit from while in the long run say you buy at $565 then I think there is a good chance you will profit held over the next 2 to 3 years.

Oh I'm not forgetting the halvening but there is no definites here so instead of "must" think "will probably".  Even at the last halvening the price did double but not until a couple of months later (I think, was definitely after).
This time around there is also quite a bit of uncertainty over Core vs Classic, what's happening with the Miners, full blocks, scaling, segwit, etc, etc.  Generally uncertainty has a negative effect on the price.
Ultimately it's everyone's personal decision when they think it's best to invest.  For example if you're absolutely certain the price will definitely double then sell everything into Bitcoin, sell your house, your clothes, your tv, your laptop, anything of value and move to a friends sofa for a few weeks.  On an absolute definite you'd be mad not to  ;)

Yes it is being touted as a solution but the result will not be Bitcoin as you see it today.  The Lightning Network will very likely result in very centralised hub &amp; spoke network centered around exchanges where fiat enters and leaves the system.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:45:01










That example isn't comparable unless the restaurant charges for the use of the mens room.
In which case they should probably be charging by the hour rather than per visit.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:24:15
Well there's one near me that charges per visit.  If say there wasn't enough capacity to meet "demand" then people would be upset (understandably when nature calls) and the operator would miss out on revenue.  Clearly the restroom would need to be extended to meet demand :)
@_date: 2016-06-08 10:39:36
The example is too idealistic, in the real world Bob, Carol and Alice will all have a channel open to an exchange not each other.
Sure, a small number of people might go to the effort of opening a channel with each other but the rest of the network will be centralized hub &amp; spoke.  See 
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:51:04
I suggest you research MPesa for a centralised example.
Bitcoin could be this internationally with no central organisation but the fees need to be low.
Low cost international remittance is a big possible benefit too.  There are millions of workers sending money home and they are only loyal to the cheapest method but to break into this market Bitcoin needs to be accepted in both origin and destination countries (oh and be cheap).
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:35:39
Well I started writing a really lengthy reply to each element of your post but I think I can summarise better.
* Great, if businesses are wanting to use Bitcoin then lets NOT push them away (this was the dream wasn't it ?).
* Isn't it a bad thing if we are actively losing out to alts ?
* So we hit 12 billion, big deal. It could go back down to 7 in a week and then we're back to being worth (roughly) the same as MS paid for LinkedIn.  The value of the network is in the money moving through it and that should drive the exchanges.  Short-term jumps are speculators who don't really represent a stable "value".
* "Could we raise the blocksize limit to 2mb safely? Yeah, probably we could." - Great :)
* "But, even if we did that, that space would get flooded immediately." - More users ?  Also Great :)
* The best "low risk" code is small and low impact.
* Recent changes (you mentioned segwit) are significant code changes and high impact.
* The software engineering and critical systems principles you allude to encourage a process where the design/coding ratio is 90%/10% but I don't see this happening at the moment (by anyone to be fair).  See 
* Surely then the change with the lowest risk has the least impact to the code and the least impact to the network ?




This I'm quoting since I want to argue that they are contradictory.  You say that the acceptable level of risk is very low and then immediately advocate changes which have the potential to re-write the entire topology of the network.  Hasn't a certain smart contract bug in a certain alt proven that risk today ?
@_date: 2016-06-07 11:15:47

Hello, is there any further update on this ?  Thanks
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:47:55
If you really want to buy my advice is wait 6 months.  There's allot going on at the moment with changes to the chinese exchanges resulting in lower volume and lower support. 
In addition to this the network is in my mind loosing value due to lower utility. So as long as Bitcoin works and hasn't been hacked then it has technical worth but the increasing transaction congestion is eroding this utility.  Things are more serious because there is no common agreement on how to solve this.  Still, at least there's been no hacks and the tech is still secure (if slow/unreliable).
So in summary wait and see and then buy and hold.

You probably didn't get much interest since 3 years ago all the focus was on de-centralised peer to peer networks and enhancing the blockchain code.  
Side chain ideas were only just being floated and off chain hub networks were in their infancy at the proposal stage.  At least that's what I saw at the time though I did mainly just inhabit bitcointalk.

I don't think you understand, a segwit formatted transaction replaces the current transaction format.  After soft fork activation ALL transactions will have the segwit format.  
They will however still appear valid to old nodes which is why this is being called a "soft" rather than a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:52:21
Rough search, top google result : 


@_date: 2016-06-08 08:44:21


I'm talking about a general release schedule and the benefits of having one (which Core does not). **Nothing to do with Segwit.**
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:57:11
Hmmmmm.... so it's odd that Huobi is missing but if you sum OkCoin and BTChina that's a 30.47% share.  I don't think this has shaken out yet though and I think some traders have yet to move from these exchanges to others which still offer leverage (especially those from the US riding VPNs).
@_date: 2016-12-14 16:23:08
Ah ok, this makes more sense then.  In other words segwit transactions are invalid and will be rejected **until activation** after which they will be included in blocks by miners.  Does that agree with your understanding ?
@_date: 2016-12-14 11:40:05
Didn't Matt say this was 3 years ago ? Anyway the point it moot since at the time malleability was a known issue (except to Gox) and anyone trying to setup side channels would have had the same problems with it in Jan 2014 as in Nov 2015.

Well as the official guide it should be ELI5 clear with no abiguity.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:19:20
Makes sense, the creation of segwit transactions is after all dependant on client applications (exchanges, wallets, merchants etc) to upgrade their software to the segwit format.

The news sites constantly using images of physical coins is misleading, confusing and very annoying.  Having this on bitcoin.com is only going to confuse new people further.

Ok then good because just setting something that doubles every two years seems very arbitrary and not very well thought out. Especially since if you extend this to 20 years you're looking at 8,192 megabyte blocks.

Brilliant, the most insightful thing I've read on this to date.
Especially relevant is the observation that there is no head or proper leadership. Bitcoin development (core or otherwise) is currently a dozen different people all trying to head the same goats (everyone else) at the same time and sometimes it's in the same direction but mostly it isn't. 
I say goats and not sheep because goats don't just follow the heard and need to be lead.  Bitcoin is mostly full of goats since most everyone has their own mind and opinion and not many blindly follow the masses.  We need to be convinced to support an idea and that's how we found Bitcoin in the first place.

All transactions wouldn't fit, it would just dynamically realc something like this....
* If the average transaction volume since the last re-calc is &lt; 50% of the max no change
* If the average transaction volume since the last re-calc is 50% to 70% of the max increase by 10%
* If the average transaction volume since the last re-calc is 70% to 80% of the max increase by 30%
* If the average transaction volume since the last re-calc is 80% to 90% of the max increase by 50%
* If the average transaction volume since the last re-calc is 90% to 100% of the max increase by 100%
So for someone to "game" the system they would have to flood the network with transactions for every block between difficulty re-calcs to engineer a size doubling. Otherwise there is a gradual increase.
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:55:39
I like the dynamic idea.
Say when the difficulty is re-calculated then the limit is also re-calculated based on transaction volume since the last adjustment.
@_date: 2015-08-27 10:51:15
Just a picky point but in some places we are asked to "Agree/Disagree" to questions.  These should really be clear statements and then expressing an opinion about it becomes allot easier &amp; less confusing.
I've completed the questionnaire but felt like I had to work out the statement behind the question for these points.
@_date: 2015-08-18 14:05:41
I suspect the take is like this.
Since the choice is between action (joining XT) and inaction and there is no 3rd choice then everyone is forced to choose.  Ergo if XT stays with it's current 10.6% of nodes then "Team Core" will consider themselves to have "won" and vice versa if the 75% of mined blocks target is met.  It's like a civil war and you're either with the establishment or the rebels.
Maybe if the node count hits a stable 50% then everyone will sit down and talk with compromise more likely. However this creates a risk of what I'd suggest is a VERY bad scenario since the test is against mined blocks.  Lets say the node count is a stable 50% but the mining pools running XT have an especially lucky run and manage to trigger the "75%+ of mined blocks" test. Ok there is a two week grace period (good idea) which is a buffer but after this the XT nodes will switch and fork.  If the node count is still 50% then this could *break* bitcoin with the network splitting (an XT network with high mining power but fee users and a Core network with low mining power and the majority of users). Please let me know if I have this wrong and this scenario isn't possible.
Personally I think bigger blocks is a good idea, 8 megabytes is a bit of a big first step but not the end of the world.  However I don't like this from the patch notes :


The correct word here would be "exponentially" not "smoothly " and do they REALLY think we'll need 256 megabyte blocks in 10 years ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:25:51
Multisig is a different beast, businesses are to be built on multisig.
We disagree on RBF so fair enough there.  I genuinely meant it when I wished you a nice day lol
As for Satoshi well many people agree with his expectation that the blocksize might need to increase.  Also many people disagree with RBF regardless of Satoshi implementing something similar in the early days.  Sometimes these are the same people.
Just because someone supports the "original vision" of an historic character doesn't mean you have to support everything they said/did.

Well thanks for the indepth response but **everything you said requires internet access** and I specifically said where there is **no direct internet access**.
It makes no sense to put racks of 100s or 1000s of ASIC chips online anyway, they need access to the central Pool server (which will need access) and that's it.
@_date: 2017-04-10 10:58:38

With 30 minutes between 1Mb blocks. Even if Segwit is enabled most of those transacions will be in the traditional format and the only thing going to the moon will be the mempool.
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:53:36
That's more than traditional methods of moving fiat around so I think that's pretty unlikely.

We were talking about the transaction pool back log and if some of the transactions were spam.  The point is that any transaction which pays a fee isn't spam and I don't see that you have disputed this.
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:49:22
Ok but for most merchants it will make the most sense to treat RBF transactions as 2nd class and to show them as "pending" until confirmed.  Assuming this is the case users will most likely be disabling RBF to avoid this.
What is the use-case for an RBF transaction outside of paying merchants ?  
Is it just payments between indviduals ? 
Sounds like a feature for the sake of the feature to me.  It might be "cool" but if a feature isn't **needed** then in my opinion it shouldn't be included.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:09:39
Haha sorry, getting tetchy today I think; no offense intended :)
I agree it's a big security oversight, no problem with that. I just object to the suggestion that all these mining rigs will have internet access, are vunerable to various DNS exploits and can be taken down wholesale.
In all probability the laziest config for a large mining operation would be to not setup any DNS for the mining rigs and to hard code the mining pool IP address. This isn't ideal for various reasons but they wouldn't be vunerable to this issue.

I was just talking about the on chain transaction generated when the channel closes.  I don't expect that opening a channel would gerenate a transaction with a large script but I could be wrong.


In my personal opinion this is the most complicated change since the invention of Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:29:24


Yup, agreed and understood since they can afford the time delay.  After all you're not going to expect delivery until (at best) the next day.


Ok so this an example where there would be an issue, however this is an **inconvience** really but why should bitcoin be inconvient to use ?  It is assumed here that the merchant will accept an RBF transaction but their accepted risk level says only after 3 confirmations.












Note that if in scenarios 2 or 3 you didn't reverse the transaction in time then you might have paid twice and you will have to find a way to get a refund.  This is based on my understanding that if the replacement transaction isn't picked up by miners in time then the initial transaction is added and is now not reverseable.
@_date: 2016-02-16 15:31:59
Well said
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:21:59
Well as I have said elsewhere the whole thing is a storm in a teacup. Like the Tesla example sure they could deliberately abuse this to disable hardware remotely but it would destroy their business. Telsa isn't going to brick their cars, Bitmain aren't going to disable Antimners.
As for a hacker doing the same internal access to a miners network would be needed and if you're deep enough inside a miner to mess with DNS then there are more profitable things you can do like look for private keys, rerouting hash, claiming block rewards for yourself etc. Killing the chips would be like sneaking into a bank and burning the notes. 
Even if you do this as a competing miner you risk shooting yourself in the foot by de-valuing bitcoin if you show another miner can be hacked and their hash taken down.

@_date: 2016-02-11 10:53:00
Ok that's great and all but how about with the default full node and wallet as you are promoting ?
If I'm right and your IP does get broadcast then I'd only just that your wiki should reflect this.  Especially if there are solutions to stop this from happening since they should be mentioned too.
The "bad actors" out there can do alot with just an IP address.
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:14:56
Ok so....






.... the suggestion here is that having full blocks is a good thing since it creates pressure for fees to increase as users complete to have their transaction processed.
And you are arguing that this is not only a good reason but an Awesome reason to keep the blocks small and that high fees benefit the system ?  I've seen some analysis that suggets fees could hit $5 a transaction, do you still see this as good for Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:40:18
I misunderstood that a transaction has to be pre-marked as "RBF-able" in advance and then did a bit of a search which threw up this post from November :


@_date: 2016-02-08 18:38:51


0 fee transactions were possible, now are not and hey suprise we have disillusioned users.
Since you're mentioning the whitepaper you might be interested that this was coded by Satoshi himself.  There was a choke/limit though where only a few were allowed each block with a queue sorted by age and value.  It was better than a total ban though and it meant there was a chance that someone's 0 fee transaction (deliberate or accidental) would get processed eventually.
I always liked the social justice that yes the network was fee based but someone could move money for free if they had the patience.  Also I thought Bitcoin was to help the global unbanked who are usually very poor, for example some guy in Africa who only earns a few dollars a week. The current capitalists don't seem to believe in this vision though leading to a network for the 1st world or instuitions only.
Guess I'm too much of an idealist lol
@_date: 2016-02-12 10:42:48
You missed out this but from the conclusion :  **The current proposed “hard fork” replacement software seems at first blush to be a reasonable way to solve Bitcoin’s growth issues.**
So much FUD
@_date: 2016-02-23 14:53:33


Absolutely... and agreed, this is why I say that a merchant would have to wait for the transactions to be included in a block.  I'd say 3 to 5 blocks to avoid orphan chains etc.
Before a transction is included in a block anything can happen and the merchant has no control... it is only up to them if they accept a 0 conf transaction or replacement transaction or wait for block confirmation.
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:54:10
I'm trying to see how the fee cost relates to my point (and your point about spam) but frankly I don't see it.
Transactions with fees contribute to the network, pay the miners and are not spam.  End of story.
Oh btw your fee of 0.0001 BTC will not be sufficent at the moment.  Currently the typical fee is "12,800 satoshis" or 0.000128 BTC and rising.

I hadn't seen this before and it was an excellent read. Thanks for commenting.
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:38:44


I'd say this isn't true while the same blockchain is used.  Until some event like a hard-fork occurs these are different implementations of the Bitcoin source code.
According to the nodes site you link there are currently nodes reachable identifying themselves as 90+ different implementations of Bitcoin using the same shared blockchain. I'm counting previous versions of the "core" client here too, essentially I'm saying if the nodes generate blocks the whole network accept then it doesn't matter which source code the binaries are compiled from.
If the nodes diverage and generate blocks no longer accepted by other nodes then there is a hard-fork and things get "interesting" lets say.
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:48:46
Well TCP isn't quite the same since it's transparent to the user.  The average user won't know anything about it or even know the name.  Now HTTPS is worth explaining so they know the differece between a secure and insecure page.
Anyway, back to Bitcoin.  It is worth being able to explain how bitcoin works and how it is secured because people need to have enough faith in the tech to be able to put their hard earned cash into it.
The original bitcoin system/network as envisiged by satoshi can be explained to most anyone with some exception around how mining works ("hard sums" is used alot) and probably the detail of how a transaction is processed (the script). People can understand a ledger of transactions and a private key vs a public key.
However once you add RBF, SW and side chains like the Lightning network it gets alot harder.
I can see people asking me "but am I buying bitcoin or lightningcoin ? Why after buying bitcoin do I have to move some to this lightning thing ? When I want to pay do I look for the Bitcoin logo or the Lightning logo ?"
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:08:24
If the blockchain says that a balance has moved from address A to address B then this is set in stone.  The whole security of the system depends on this and it doesn't matter if the transaction was an RBF one or not.
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:52:25
Well I did here :


Also in the example I had to find a way to include where someone has used RBF &amp; then failed to switch it off to give the example any meaning.  If the scenario is "guy switches off RBF, never uses it" then what is the point of RBF at all ?  
This brings me back to the concern above.
Edit : Also if the scenario is "guy deliberatly pays with RBF switched on" then that's just dumb since the merchant will either make them wait for x number of confirmations or ask for another method of payment.
Edit2: Thinking further I'm not sure we are getting anywhere and we're going in circles so maybe it's just best to call it a day and move on. Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:15:47
Ok so isn't running a full node then the **least** private way to use bitcoin ?
From your IP someone can match all your transactions to your wallet(s) and it's possible for authorities (or social engineering bad actor) to extract your personal details from your ISP tracing you to your name &amp; address.  
Surely using a web client this is harder to do with less personal details exposed and this is even better if you use say the Bitcoin mobile app with locally stored &amp; encrypted keys ?
(not forgetting to backup your keys that is)

I think/assume so or since the data has to be somewhere but honestly I don't know enough about that bit to say for certain.  Still picking this up bit by bit.
As for my opinion well I'm a traditionalist/luddite I guess, I like the current way of doing things.  That said if I'm going to take a stance on something I do my best to educate myself about it since an uninformed decision is a blind decision.
The more I learn about SW more it looks to be pretty complicated and much less of a quick "2 Mb" solution than as advertised by certain people.  This gives an advantage to indviduals developing side-chain solutions needing a more complicated script component while the wider network only gains the space saving very slowly as wallets &amp; other systems are upgraded.

@_date: 2016-02-23 14:24:15
The merchant has no say here and the safest option for the merchant is to wait for say 3 to 5 confirmations and only then can they be certain they have been paid.
Any earlier and the payment to their wallet could have been overridden by a higher fee payment to a different wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:27:16






So surely this is a "bad thing" and kills innovation ?  Sounds like the "net neutrality" issue where only the bigger companies can afford to pay for fast data connections (or in this case fast transaction processing).
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:29:46


Sounds very sensible to me but in some business cases the users may not want to suffer a delay.  Payment at a till being an extreme (but currently rare) example and say payment for something time-critical like a takeaway.  
Paying for takeaway with bitcoin is a great way to demonstrate the power of the tech to the uninitiated but if this comes with delays then it will put people off. Ah well, guess we'll just have to see how it works out in practice !

Only if you have configured your DNS server to lookup to other DNS servers smartass. If you don't do this then that it what I would describe as an internal DNS which only provides addresses for the local network.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:25:09


Very engaging
I think the points are as follows :


Since the script is visible in the transaction the transaction process is visible, easy to explain to newcomers and can be manually checked if need be.


I suggest you go and do some research.  Of course the transaction is propogated and included.  The bit missing is the **script** since this is no longer included in the transaction. Instead this is held as part of the Merkle tree (the root of which is included) and frankly I don't know if the script will even be viewable in the form it is today.

Well.... the statement I was commenting on was


Which plainly states that "Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic" are "some kind of government sponsored attack".
Core is the only missing implementation not in the above list so I think so say what I did is fair :


Finally the video is clearly focused on implementations which impact the protocol (as these all do).  Any which don't (core ported to java/whatever) count as whichever protocol they correspond to. If someone ports BU to run on an AS/500 crazy as that would be, yes that's a different implementation but still BU in the context of the video.
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:16:58
But the initial payment to the merchant doesn't have the RBF flag set.
The **replacement** transaction with the higher fee does and this could send the money straight back to the initial wallet.
This has the higher fee and overrides the payment to the merchants address.

Whoop ! With that 2x segwit multiplier the LTC blocksize is going to be kept under 10kb for a few more years. That's effectively 2038Kb free space per block !
So yeah, LTC doesn't really need segwit and never had a scaling needing a scaling solution. Wallet providers will also probably be slow to adopt segwit formatted transactions since there's little urgency to do so.
It's a bit like upgrading your windows 3.11 PC from a Pentium to the latest Intel i7 and expecting it to run noticeably faster. Ignoring driver issues of course.

Awwww come on, you asked for an example and then you give me that back ? At least comment or refute the example.  
My concerns is more like "This is a tool added for the sake of adding a neat tool".  
This brings NO advantage to the merchant, only inconvience.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:25:21
But the RBF enabled transaction will still be added to the blockchain since the miners will process this as normal (regardless of the merchant).
@_date: 2016-02-24 12:46:23
If the transaction fee is &gt; $100 then you can kiss good bye to any merchants accepting bitcoin and any chance of bitcoin replacing say western union for remittance.  Without adoption and useage there is no chance of bitcoin realising it's true potential.
Also if you're thinking $100 fees mean 1 BTC is going to be worth $10k then remember it's the minium BTC fee that's increasing, not the $$ value.  Already the minium fee is &gt; 0.00012 and next year if you really want to be sure of getting your transaction into the next block then you could be looking at a fee of between 0.0005 and 0.001 BTC. High fee &lt;&gt; high bitcoin value.
If you want a high bitcoin value then this comes with greater useage which feeds demand.  Higher and higher demand on a limited resource increases it's value.
@_date: 2016-02-23 14:59:28
Before a transction is included in a block there is a state of "flux" with rbf where there could be any number of "initial" 0 conf transactions or replacement transactions floating around.  At this state the merchant gets to choose what they believe as to which transaction is "true".
However once mined and transactions are included in a block then everything is final and under the RBF principle the highest fee transaction will be included with the rest discarded.
If the merchant has chosen to believe they have been paid when in fact the money was returned to sender (as accepted/processed by miners) then tough luck to them. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 13:02:59


So if you send a transaction with a fee of 0.001 you can "replace" it later with another with a fee of 0.005 and miners will pick this instead.  I've not heard that there is any filter on the **outputs** so you could just change the output to be another address, your own address even.
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:14:33


Well I don't claim to be a security expert so educate me. There is a computer on an internal network with no direct internet access. How do you compromise DNS without gaining internal network access ?
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:31:12
Developers are by nature lazy/risk averse so I think software will only switch to SW style transactions if they have to for that extra space.  As a result the network as a whole won't see much benefit, maybe if this rolls out today in then 12 months 20% of the transaction volume could be SW transactions (in my opinion).
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:28:00
Well I don't really know much about mem pool pruning to be honest so not going to try and talk about that.  Research needed :)


Agreed, sort of.  As I just said to someone else the initial transaction will be a normal (unconfirmed) transaction but there is a chance additional transactions might be added with a higher fee and these are the RBF ones.  
I'm not proud of this as an anology but lets say you're paying with $$ in person and the till represents the blockchain.  Cash you have handed over but which hasn't made it into the till yet is "unconfirmed" and via RBF you could snatch it back from the cashier or even give it to the person next to you instead.  
As a result merchants will always make sure the money has made it into the till (blockchain) before handing over goods/services.  This wait for blockchain confirmation may be 1 to 10 blocks depending on the merchants appitite for risk but this will still kill quick 0 conf transactions.  
There was some double-spend risk with 0 conf transactions before but this is functionality specifically designed to allow transactions to be overridden. Merchants wanting a quick &amp; reliable payment method will be pushed to alt coins with a quicker block time or side-chain solutions.
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:47:34
Yaaaaayyyyyyyyy...... * punches the sky *
Selfishly though what would benefit me most is a secure payments network so I can shove the cards in the shredder and never give card details to another company again.  
With this agenda I bought into the original network concept and I see side-chain projects as a distraction.  Companies should be encouraged to adopt Bitocoin as a payment method and not some venture capital backed "better than bitcoin" system.  Too many offerings creates market confusion which hinders market adoption. 
As a secondary bonus I think the network should allow quick and cheap international transfers, particualy for the developing world.  The hinderance to this is high fees, a fraction of a dollar might not be much to someone in the 1st world but it will be a big deal to some poor guy in africa.  At the moment I fear that this is the direction things are headed, possibly over $1 in the next 2 to 3 years.
This isn't just because I'm a nice guy but because every transaction pays a fee and the money is more likely to be there in high transaction volume rather than low volume &amp; high fees.  High volume also means high demand and a higher exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:32:54
Only if there are wallets and services on Litecoin which have upgraded to Segwit. It will be interesting to see the % of Segwit transactions per block (and in the mempool) after activation.  I'm sure someone will make a chart for that.
@_date: 2016-02-08 16:26:37
There is alot of controversy around this and several related issues at the moment but at it stands the stance from the main "Core" development team is to discourage "microtransactions" and I think $1 would count.
Changes along these lines include the removal of fee free transactions and there is an enforced minium now.  Any transactions which do not meet the minium never get picked up by miners and included in blocks but do still get circulated around the network.  This has the side-effect that in most wallets you will not be able to resend the transaction with a higher fee since it is blocked by the first, unconfirmed transaction.
Secondly there is a (currently purely idealogical) stance that users adding transactions to the network should pay a fee appropiate to the urgency so if you would like fast confirmation then a higher fixed amount fee would be needed (regardless of the transaction amount).
The source of the controversy is that many people disagree with this stance though it's hard to judge how many people sit in which camp.  Personally I'm all for the bitcoin I was sold 2 years ago, fee free transactions and all.

So which is the "Awesome" reason you see ?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:29:58
An extra note since hotile miners were mentioned.  
The difficulty readjustment would push the difficulty down to retarget back to 10 mins blocks so 30% has would become 100% hash at the new difficulty (roughly 3x easier).  But this applies to all miners so if a hostile miner on the majority chain ocassionally mines a minority chain block (empty or not) then they would have 3x the infulence. 
So for example mining outfit DigBTC Inc. today has 18% of the hash and after the fork they are on the majority chain with 70% of the hash. 
If they are feeling nice they could ocassionally mine a minority chain block. They could in this way speed up the time taken to lock-in/activate Segwit and the time till a difficulty readjustment (useful as long as their hash doesn't affect the readjustment) reducing your 57 days.
However if they are feeling evil (hostile even) they could wait until after the difficulty readjustment when their 18% hash is factored up to 54% due to the lower difficulty and mess with the network. Pick your poision basically, empty blocks would just be the simplest attack when you can outgun to that degree and spawn new blocks faster than any other miner.
I don't think miners would realistically do this since they are businesses and they would want to spend their hash and mining the chain which earns them money. If they have picked the majority chain camp then you should be able to safely assume they think that's the best place for them to earn them money. After all they have bills to pay and hash thrown at the minority chain costs them in electricity and man hours that need to be paid for.

For the masses in the context that the masses should be the ones owning and using Bitcoin not the elite 1% of bankers and institutions. If you think that having bitcoin operate as some sort of global settlement currency means the value will sky rocket then I expect you to be sadly mistaken.  Institutions will want to keep their fees low and lost fees mean infrequent but high value transactions. Low transaction volume means low demand for bitcoin and a low valuation. They won't want to hold bitcoin either, just buy, move &amp; sell as quickly as possible.
You have no idea how much I do or do not own and I have nothing to justify to you.  I'll just say that my involvement is much longer than the age of this account.

There is no such thing as a spam transaction unless you mean 0 fee transactions (which can be identified).  Every transaction is someone trying to move money and paying a fee.
There are small transactions but I'm about to buy lunch and I'll be paying on my Credit Card. A payment for a sandwich will not be very much but VISA will be very happy to collect a fee for my small transaction and will certainly not consider my lunch time purchase to be "spam".

It's worth asking why is a former Green Beret even bothering to ccomment on Bitcoin ?  The answer I think is self interest - he's seeking to up his tech credentials.
I did a brief google and here is a Ted talk from March 2015


From twitter he seems to have only discovered Bitcoin in August last year :
And since then (esp. after mid October) there have been lots of Bitcoin and later lots of Eth posts as well.  Mostly pretty controversial subjects too.

It's worth noting that this isn't a magic wand either.... wallets which support segwit will be able to create these smaller transactions which can then be processed by miners which support segwit.  The space saving will be VERY gradual as wallets and other systems which place transactions (eg exchanges) are upgraded to segwit.

If nodes with pruning enabled are unable to upload blocks and don't store a large amount of the blockchain then would you consider these to be Full Nodes ?
Also can these be identifies compared to other discoverable 0.12 nodes ?  (or are they not reachable by nature ?)
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:19:19
If the commonly held definition of a Full Node disagrees with the wiki then maybe this should be added as a Myth ?
Or the wiki should be updated :)  Full says to me all singing, all dancing with all features (like relaying) enabled.  If you limit the definition to those which follow the "rules of bitcoin" then do you eliminate all nodes running on old versions (rules) ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:38:39


Really ? This would be very unwise of them since most points of exchange require ID checks and all transactions can be traced throughout the network.  There was a previous report about bitcoin being used to finance terrorist activities and it was very quickly rubbished by the community.
I'd suggest you do your research before publishing anything ;)
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:54:17
Yes true and why I don't think anyone would dare try and fork with anything less than a substantial majority. I think 75% is the lowest I've seen and this is as designed, it is supposed to be economically costly for miners to stay on the minority chain.

Great, someone knows of a thing but doesn't understand the scenario. Key words in the example here are :
* on an internal network
* no direct internet access
Assuming they even bothered to setup a DNS server and didn't just address everything by IP then this would be an internal DNS listing server names and IP addresses statically. It's not going to be connecting to the net to get whatever IP google.com is because that would give all the network effective net access.

What difference does that make if their internal DNS server doesn't connect to the ISP's DNS server ? Or for that matter any DNS server.
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:02:00
Well once a SW transactions is included in a block then I believe it is included in the chain forevermore regardless if that block is propagated to legacy nodes.
Now if a new SW transaction is passed to a legacy node then I believe it would be considered invalid and wouldn't be propagated or included in a mined block.  If it is included (I think, limits of my knowledge here) it would appear as an open transaction spendable by anyone.
Edit :  Just found this which clears it up a bit more (assuming it's accurate lol)

Well I agree with this. The rest is just politics.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:02:19
The roadblock on this isn't the code, it's politics.
Bitcoin Cash implemented replay protection since they expected to be a minority chain and wanted to survive in tandem with Bitcoin Core. The Segwit2x HF is intended to take over as the majority chain and anyone running on the minority 1Mb chain is to be pushed to one side so the stakes (&amp; tensions) are very high.

C++ does have the performance edge, always has unless you want to start coding in assembly and that's only ever done when you have 1% of the code getting 99% of the CPU time.
Are you saying they don't have C++ skills and if so what evidence do you have ?
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:31:00
Depends where you look to be honest and if it's just this sub then you may get a distorted perspective. As far as I see things it breaks down like this :
Miners are the clearest group since they indicate support in the blocks they mine and at the moment 93% of blocks indicate support for Segwit2x 
Companies are less clear since you have a range of exchanges/intermediaries/merchants/other of various sizes and some are more vocal than others. There have been attempts to get agreement (New York Agreement) but it's like herding goats. Currently 21% support or are "ready" for Segwit2x and 15% are against Segwit2x. However 64% nobody has any formal statement from so as an indicator the poll is fairly weak even before you consider that this is not weighted by size, just counted. 
Counting nodes is also a problem and unreliable for various reasons : the Segwit2x team haven't released a final version of the client yet; it's possible for 1 user to run 100s of nodes; some clients are also 2Mb block compatible (BU I think) but don't flag as Segwit2x
Finally when it comes to "users" the actual man in the street wanting to move money it's really hard to get a reliable idea what they want. Many users don't engage here or the other forums. Various polls have been tried (eg Twitter) but they can be easily gamed. Frankly like the companies I don't think many people care as long as they are using whatever "Bitcoin" is commonly accepted.
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:52:20
I think plenty of people assumed the core release would automatically support segwit too but that isn't the case.  If core couldn't get a fully debugged and tested wallet out then why expect anyone else to ?
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:03:25
I think the real trouble is that there isn't any comparison for Bitcoin, it's too different to anything else. Analogies don't fit any other economic systems don't really compare either.
Regardless of companies for &amp; against I'm left wishing more would state a stance. I think coin.dance has something like 63% of companies Uknown or Silent on Segwit2x though that takes no account for company size.
Wasn't the UASF campaign "fuck your concerns, research, ideas and technical requests, we're doing this" but just directed at the miners ?
Anyway popcorn out for November, no matter which way this goes I hope at least we can move on from this as a community. This issue has been so toxic.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:56:22
Ok so Armory I think should be more like "indifferent" though I agree they aren't supporters :


For Electrum the linked statement ( only talks about Bitcoin Cash but does say they are an SPV wallet. Statements from Breaking Bitcoin do however state a clear "ready" and seems to show that while they might not like Segwit2x they are happy to give users the choice.
Ledger is a clear "ready" I think, at least that's what the linked post from coin.dance says ( Again no love shown by the developers so I see what you mean.
I can't help but think there's a common trend here. These are all wallet implementations which are giving their users a choice by supporting both possible chains but at the same time they risk little by being against Segwit2x in public.
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:36:32
If we had 8mb blocks and they were all full then that's 8x the transaction volume we have today and damn if that doesn't sound good. Sounds like wide man-in-the-street adoption to me with bitcoin accepted globally next to traditional fiat. Pretty certain that'd do nothing but good for the price when everyone wants some.
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:38:05
The various branches like BU, XT, Segwit2x hell even Bitcoin Cash are all based on the same original code base but they have had code changes. Sure there's been the occasional bug but that's been the case on ALL sides.
Ultimately BU and XT failed due to political reasons not due to inferior code. This remains to be seen for Segwit2x, certainly on the political side the miner support is there.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:04:23

Well I don't disagree that Segwit provides scaling, I just disagree with some people over if Segwit alone provides enough scaling and usually how much scaling.


Again when it comes to Lightning I'm not saying that it won't work I'm mainly saying that this distributed node network that keeps appearing in blog posts and presentations is idealistic. I think Lightning will lead to more centralisation than we currently have.
I am also concerned that Lightning could supplant Bitcoin in time and the general public will be looking for an "We Accept Lightning" sticker on the shop window rather than "We Accept Bitcoin". Some people may say this is a good thing and Bitcoin should be "Settlement" only but I don't see why all transactions can't be on chain.
As for micro transactions I'd consider these to be anything less than $1 and I think these would be best served by the alts. Lightning might be able to handle them but we don't know if this will make economic sense until we know how much it costs is real terms to open and close a channel. For example if this is $10 ($5 each way) and you want to pay to read articles online then you need to lock away at least $100 to keep your fees under 10%. You could lock away $1,000 which keeps fees down to 1% but that's allot of articles at a few cents each and some people might not be able to afford to set aside that kind of money.
This makes more sense the more you use Lightning of course and that requires merchant support which requires users to want to use Lightning. A high entry cost could break this.


If we're going to have a fork one day then best to do it now while the network is small.

If I have a balance with say 1 BTC then I can use this to protect this balance in advance of the fork. My transactions will be spendable on the core fork and not spendable on the 2x fork.

Sorry, think I've got it now. Had a basic misunderstanding but now I have to rethink the implications and decide all over again if I like it lol
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:25:05
The 144 block moving average shows 1.2% to 1.36% so that's great but it's just one block you have there. I expect there will be a slow increase over the next couple of weeks followed by a quick rush up (as wallets (inc. core), merchants and exchanges add support) which will level off back to a slow rise again. Unless there is a fork to reject all legacy format transactions segwit will never reach 100% because there will always be someone running old nodes.

Well I considered engaging but as far as I can see from your post history you're a bit of a self-righteous douche. You're not going to listen to me and I'll be wasting my time.
I did want to say though that sure plenty of people in the "other sub" are quite vocal about Bitcoin Cash but more people support Segwit2x. 
They aren't against segwit as such but they just don't see it as a scaling solution. It's like being against putting additives in your gas, sure it'll make your car a tiny bit faster or more efficient but a bigger engine does a much better job. If your loud ass bro who is a self proclaimed mechanic genius insists then you might give in to keep him quiet but you're going to book your car into the garage for that bigger engine anyway. Just so you know this isn't really me engaging since I don't intend to reply to you. Have a nice day :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:22:08
Misleading. 17% "support" and 4% are "ready" for Segwit2x so that's 21%.
On the other side 15% are against and the majority is "unknown" at 64%.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:09:17
Well, there's a MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT of 4000000 but when the size validation check is made the current block weight is multiplied by a WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR of 4 making a test of "Block size without witness data * 4 &lt; 4000000". This can be easily rationalized down to "Block size without witness data &lt; 1000000" which is the 1Mb cap.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:06:06
You're just talking speculation, that's just one tiny aspect of Bitcoin but then you're here to make money so I understand why.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:03:46


Bitcoin Core ? No, just the DesignerAccount guy. I treat everyone as individuals :)


Easy, Segwit is dependant on the whole network upgrading to segwit transactions (as you say 10% in 10 weeks), gives a scaling benefit dependent on the type of transactions (complicated ones benefit more) and wasn't actually designed as a scaling solution but a fix to transaction malleability. In contrast the blocksize increase in a simple increase to the 1Mb cap on the blocksize and is solely a scaling solution.
Based on the current trend of 1% a week yes, it could be another 90 weeks before we see 100% assuming a linear progression.  
Seriously though I think we'll see more of a slow progression (1% a week is slow) followed by a rush up to say 40 to 50% as the popular wallets and exchanges upgrade and then slower progress again as stragglers catch up. Some people may prefer to run the older versions of the client so you might never see more than 95% adoption.  I looked around for a chart type to best describe this and all I could find was "Ease In Ease Out Circular". Middle column, 3rd rows down from the top 
If you want to bring Lightning into this too hang on while I try to dig out some of my old posts. I might miss a point repeating myself.
Edit : There's this from some months ago were I was mainly talking about centralisation risks. I had some misunderstandings at the time with some of the technical detail but the centralisation issue remains as far as I see it.

Well my analogy was a quick one line throwaway to be honest but thanks for taking it to the next level.
After some thought I think maybe the I should have used something train related, gauges or train size maybe but that doesn't "fit" very well either.
I think it's worth pointing out that the New York Agreement I believe involved more than just a few miners (car manufacturers ?) and there are quite a few big players signed up too. Cobra's post has a handy list.

@_date: 2017-10-13 00:08:41
But Bitcoin Cash isn't really comparable because the EDA logic brought the difficulty down not long after the fork making it profitable to mine. If Core add the same logic then I agree but at the moment the minor chain will be stuck with a high difficulty and won't be profitable.
All assuming of course that core are the minor chain in November :)
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:57:03
You know what you just said doesn't really mean anything ?
The protocol doesn't care what language you code in as long as the rules are followed. The bitcoin code base has been ported to a few other languages than C++ already (including Javascript) and hell you could probably convert it to Pascal too or (god forbid) .Net
Also C++ isn't exactly a rare language and even though it's a tiny percentage of C++ devs neither is Linux kernel development :


So big deal.

When the subject is a fork which exists because there are two competing plans you do kinda need to cover that including the basic detail of what they are. I didn't even use the word "upgrade" anywhere and just used "change" instead.


I don't think many other people commenting here would agree with you there no matter which scaling solution they support.
I'm not really here to debate to be honest, just to give the ELI5.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:50:22
I'll try assuming no knowledge....
* Bitcoin is backed by a miners processing transactions and their computing power is measured as "hash power/rate"
* The P2P network and mining had a fixed protocol and one aspect of the current network is that a block/collection of transactions is capped at 1Mb
* There has been some congestion over the last year and there are competing ideas of how to increase capacity. 
* One is a change to the transaction format called "segwit" which moves some of the data so it is not counted when the &lt; 1Mb check is performed.
* Segwit has been "enabled" since the 1st of August and [10% of transactions]( use the new format (this is "Opt-In" and adoption takes time)
* A competing solution is to amend the block cap from 1Mb to 2Mb but this is not as simple as it sounds
* A change to the blocksize needs to be coordinated - if a miner just starts to create bigger blocks on their own they will be rejected. 
* This create the "fork" scenario after which two P2P networks will exist following different protocol rules (1Mb vs 2Mb) but they both need compute power &amp; miners to function
* The hash power is directly related to the "speed" of the network. Functioning normally a block of transactions should be processed every 10 minutes and if the compute power drops then this increases. 
* A 90/10 split gives one network with blocks every 100 minutes and one with blocks every 11 minutes.
* There is logic to adjust this and re-target every 10 minutes again but this is timed as every 2016 blocks and this is found as (block times * blocks left till re-target). This is known as the difficulty adjustment
* The activation of 2Mb blocks is expected mid November (~20th) by which time the users on the network wanting to support 2Mb blocks need to have made technical changes.
* Since segwit activated approximately 94% of miners have been indicating support for 2Mb blocks (commonly known as the Segwit2x agreement - Segwit &amp; 2Mb)
* For the block timing &amp; retarget reasons above this percentage is critically important.
* Today a miner F2Pool has stopped signaling support for 2Mb blocks. This is expected and has been since [late August](
* This reduces support for 2Mb blocks down to approximately 84% since F2Pool contribute about 10% of the hash power
* This sub is traditionally pro 1Mb and against 2Mb so people are happy here.
I've tried to keep this unbiased and factual. I'd also like to add that I believe the required minimum hash power support for 2Mb blocks &amp; segwit2x is 80% so I don't think this blocks 2Mb activation.

Well my first impression from the list is that there's not a 100 people there just 38 but then I noticed it's limited to just developers who have commits "since June 4th 2016". Keeps it recent I guess.
If you can find the statements that would be interesting to read but no need to spend too much time on it.  The list is only half the story since it shows that developers supporting the core wallet do not support Segwit2x but not if they would totally quit Bitcoin if Segwit2x become dominant.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:11:50
I don't think they expect miners to switch back and forth between forks.
Also this happened with Bitcoin Cash but the chain with the highest difficulty is still the main Bitcoin chain, the hash can jump but difficulty remains. 
See this chart : 
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:58:45
Interesting write up though far from objective.
Can't help but think if I were Coinbase I'd just suspend trading for 24 hours while the hash rate and the node count settles down. 
It should be clear within that time scale which protocol (1Mb/2Mb) has the widest support. This could very easily be pitched as "protecting users from loss" and for "security" given there won't be any reply protection. Of course that would mean they haven't picked a side and some people would like to see that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:04:13


I try not to feed trolls so I ignore junk posts when I see them. If you have any examples though I'll happily comment.

@_date: 2017-10-11 16:29:43


I'm not going to disagree with this but and old nodes and wallets are going to still exist. Partly due to people running old versions on principle and partly due to laziness. Seems there are even now some old 0.8.1 nodes out there 


You asked "And how is SW not a scaling solution on par with a 2x block size increase?" so this is my reasoning why they are not the same. I didn't say it was a "bad thing", more like "not as good".


Agreed here, those two charts are basically the same anyway when it comes to predicting bitcoin. Weathermen have it easy.


Ah sorry about that, edit already added but my post doesn't mention vaporware anywhere :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:42:03
Ok so help me out here then. I can code but I don't usually delve into the bitcoin code this much (we should always test ourselves shouldn't we ?).
So I believe the test is here :
    if (::GetSerializeSize(tx, SER_NETWORK, PROTOCOL_VERSION | SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_NO_WITNESS) * WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR &gt; MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT)
             return state.DoS(100, false, REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-oversize");
There's allot going on within GetSerializeSize but I'm going to simply assume this returns the block size (without witness data).  The key constants are then MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT and WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR.
These are declared as follows :
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT = 4000000;
    static const int WITNESS_SCALE_FACTOR = 4;
So a block is multiplied by 4 before it is then checked against a weight value of 4000000.  Mathematically this is the same if you move the factor of 4 to the other side of the equation but instead divide the weight value by 4. This would give a weight value of 1000000 which is the same as this old constant :
    static const unsigned int MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE = 1000000
So since you logically get the same result (a test against 1000000) then the 1Mb block size limit is still unchanged while the weight value is 4 regardless of the max block weight.
Did I read the code correctly ?
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:06:45
The weight limit check has the same end result as the old 1Mb blocksize check.
The change is to the blocksize cap, I didn't state any expectations of what the actual size would be as it was out of scope of the explanation.
Miner support is critical to the fork and the subject of the OP. I could only cover so much or I'd start to hit the character limit.
Blocks contains indicators showing miner support for various protocol proposals. This is simplified here as block signaling.
The hash F2Pool contribute is relevant to the bigger picture &amp; impact.
Yeah, I downplayed the strength of feeling some people have about the blocksize cap to stay neutral. If you didn't agree with my ELI5 why not do your own rather than pull mine apart ?
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:00:48
Appreciate the correction but "daily" still feels like an exaggeration.  The week chart starts at 6.59% and ends at 9.10% so that's 2.51% in 7 days.
I guess up 0.36% daily isn't as snappy or catchy.
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:30:56
Interesting. So in that case then if someone is fully committed to 1Mb blocks (the NO2X guys) then you can protect your balance.
It also means that in a few weeks it should be possible to see how many transactions include 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi, what their total balance is. A very visible indication of support either way.
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:50:35
FUD, that level of usage will bring many more companies and users into the space. Sure there will be a shift, the guy living in the back of beyond might not have a fast enough connection to keep up but merchants will want to run their own nodes (Bitpay will just get the small guys) so commercial nodes will replace them. You don't think it's going to cost Amazon 20k to run a node do you ? They already have the network &amp; server infrastructure and companies in this space are good at keeping services costs down.
In summary, the little guy who can't get fiber gets pushed out and commercial companies move in.

Each month I allocate a fixed groceries shopping budget and convert that amount into bitcoin.  Then each week I convert that week's budget back from bitcoin to fiat so spend on the weekly shop.
Over the last 6 months I've been doing this using giftcards since where I buy groceries doesn't accept bitcoin.  It has helped with building up a balance in "change" which was spent and cleared at christmas.
Going forward I'm planning to setup a Neteller account with a Mastercard.  If this works well then I think I'll extend this to more of the monthly spending since I'll be able to use the Mastercard in more locations.  Big weekend ahead ? Topup the Neteller card :)

@_date: 2015-04-17 11:10:33
A question for you if I may..... since your account is GBP can you confirm that BitPay funded as GBP with no currency conversion fee ?
I started with an account as NOK (for a holiday) and BitPay converted BTC to USD which Neteller then converted to NOK at a 3% fee.  I'd like to avoid this step :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:10:58
This was a bitcoin deposit and Bitpay processed it as USD so there was a conversion fee from USD to NOK (so BTC-&gt;USD-&gt;NOK).
If Bitpay had processed it as NOK then this would have been much better and a straight BTC-&gt;NOK conversion would have been no-fee as Neteller aren't passing on any fee Bitpay might charge (at the moment).
Edit :  As an afterthought, assuming you deposited in bitcoin I would theorise that if Bitpay can match the required currency than they do otherwise they default to USD.  It's much more likely they would support EUR than NOK so you had a deposit with a matching currency and my deposit defaulted to USD needing the extra conversion.

@_date: 2017-10-04 08:12:06
Ah ok, got it after reading the code more carefully.
So this works as protection as long as you include the blacklist address as an output then the post-fork segwit2x network will reject it.  However it needs to be included in every transaction you want to protect (discourages address reuse I guess).
My misunderstanding was that the source transaction would be checked somehow and would result in a new transaction being rejected. Should have thought about it more carefully because now I realise that's not practical.
@_date: 2015-04-29 09:49:00
No exchange offering GBP has yet found a local banking partner so yes this is more of the same.
The turning point will be when an exchange gets a UK banking partner and integrates transfers through the Faster Payments Network.
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:54:24
Ok, lets see. The chart above peaks at 10% after roughly 2 months (August &amp; September) so that's 5% a month.
Assuming the same trend the remaining 90% should take 18 months (90 / 5) with 100% activation expected around early April 2019.
I don't personally expect this though, I'm expecting a quick rush up to 40-50% as the most popular wallets change their transaction format and then a slow rise.
Edit : Point being he could be right about segwit

Where are these 4Mb blocks ?
Sure there is a 4Mb block weight in the code but when the validation check is made the actual block size (without witness data) is multiplied by 4. Even a 10 year old will be able to tell you that "A x 4 &lt; 4" and "A &lt; 1" are effectively &amp; mathematically the same thing.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:20:43
No problem, that's what I meant by this discouraging address reuse since as soon as you have a balance moved to an address that isn't known to the segwit2x fork then you're safe anyway.
Still re-thinking the implications here but it will work even if it might not be super elegant. Better to have a short and simple fix than something that's super complicated and takes 100s of lines of code to implement.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:45:08

You need to change the scale though to "since activation" on the 1st of August and then you'll see the same.
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:46:39
No FUD here, there is a 1Mb block size cap in the code. Haven't you been keeping up ? The segwit change bypassed this (to a degree) but it's still there.
Also I had a perfectly reasonable discussion 11 hours ago and here you are now with attacks. That's not very nice.
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:46:45

I'm trying to get setup too but it's proving hard work. Been waiting a week not for the "micropayment" to verify my UK bank account and it looks like I might have to tackle customer services.
My primary focus is to use their Master Card pre-paid card for a holiday to Norway so I opened an account denominated in NOK so I can spend the NOK balance over there with no currency conversion fees.  What I didn't realise until my first test deposit was that the bitcoin deposit is denominated in USD so there is a 3% fee changing that to NOK but it still beats high-street rates for buying holiday currency.
After the holiday I might look to change the account over to GBP though I'll still suffer the USD-&gt;GBP conversion fee.  I see this as an "early adopter" charge until someone offers a slicker solution. Obviously the ideal is to spend directly in bitcoin but Norway looks to be a long way away from this at the moment.
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:51:13
I have no idea what you're talking about and as far as I understand it :
* Before the fork these transactions are valid
* After the fork on the core chain these transactions are valid
* After the fork on the segwit2x chain these transactions are NOT valid
So if you want to protect a balance and keep it on the core chain you can place a transaction now. It will be valid on the current chain and on the future core chain.  Correct ? It sounds like you are agreeing with me but we just have a misunderstanding :

Unfortunately Bitcoin can be a harsh mistress and after investing the following come down from $1000 has proved very tough and long lasting.

Sure but a minority chain is called a minority chain because the miners will have already chosen not to mine blocks on that chain. This reduces it's utility and in my opinion it's value.

To start I just wanted to say kudos for the interesting and varied post history.
Also it's too early for anything to be "known" right now and in the current atmosphere I can't blame companies for being silent. Here for example we have speculation about an exchanges plans from an ex employee because the exchange is silent. In the bigger picture coin dance have their survey which has a 62% gap of silence ("neutral or no official stance").
Personally I think most companies will continue with their silence right up till the 11th hour, there might be some hints the week before as pressure builds (a few might give in early) but most companies will decide in the moment.
That does mean many more weeks of uncertainty though so I can't say I like it.

They never intended to honour it, the whole point was to reassure chinese miners and stall for time while segwit was developed and tested. Now here we are with a segwit release being pushed and no hint of a 2mb block size increase, not even summer 2017 as initially proposed.
There is no compromise for those people wanting bigger blocks, there is just the segwit bitter pill to swallow and the community is expected to be gratefull.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:10:17
There is no takeover. Forking with a change to the protocol doesn't mean a group of developers/companies/indviduals "owns" that fork. Any other group can release software compatible with that fork and if people like it they'll run that instead.
Also if Bitcoin Cash was created when Segwit activated on the 1st of August and this was part (1) of the Segwit2x New York Agreement doesn't that mean that the Segwit2x plan existed before Bitcoin Cash ?


What bet ? I know some were touted but I didn't think anything had been formally agreed with actual BTC placed in Escrow etc.

Yes I do, the first page is 90% vision and 10% "this is how bitcoin works".
In the white paper Satoshi had to sell his/her vision as well as discuss "this is how bitcoin works" in order to gain any interest.  Clearly people bought into it or we wouldn't be here.  Since the whitepaper many people debate what bitcoin is now and what Satoshi wanted bitcoin to become but if you're looking for the initial vision the whitepaper is the first stop.

I've been reading his posts since they first appeared on the wall watcher thread on bitcointalk and he just hasn't bought into the technology.  As such he sees Bitcoin has something which is very speculation based and new users buying bitcoin push up the price enabling holders to sell for profit (this is the ponzi accusation).  Remember he was posting throughout the whole MtGox farce with the willy bot pushing the price up.  As a result he sees it as his duty to protect other people against financial loss.  I don't see any other sinister motive.
He is a full professor and his wikki page is here :  
I don't think he's in this for the money, at 66 I would imagine that he's pretty settled and looking at retirement soon (explains his level of free time).  If he was really interested in chasing the money then he likely would have stayed in the US in 1992 rather than return to Brazil.  As someone with experience at Xerox PARC I think he could have named his price.

He is worried that segwit will not resolve the current network congestion and that and the complexity of having to calculate fees will put off new users. Finally without these new users bitcoin will die a slow myspace like death.

Diaspora.... a very interesting concept on a social network with detailed and powerful content control and privacy.  Was very interesting last time I checked it out a year or two ago.
Unfortunately it's burdened with a name that's tough to pronounce, obsscure in it's meaning and forgettable. Plus once you start to explain the meaning (in the hope it might be remembered) you bore the other person out of all interest in the social network. They should have paid attention to "google".... geeky in it's meaning yet easy to spell and remember.

If you mean 50k Fiat (USD ?) then I'd suggest registering with a few different exchanges depending on currency, submitting any docs needed for KYC checks and trading with whoever gets back to you first.
Probably would be best to transfer money to the exchange(s) in chunks rather a big lump sum and this reduces your risk with a transfer going wrong or your bank freezing your account.  
Edit :  As for the trend then yes we are up at the moment but just make your own judgement and my personal best suggestion is to set a time frame (say 1, 2 or 3 years) during which you'll buy, hold and then consider selling. Be prepared for the value to go down in the medium term and the more years you set the more likely it is you'll profit in the long run.

Their donation page is...
... and this looks to be owned and run by BlackBaud Inc ( so I would guess that since they contract out the donations they would be limited to the BlackBaud interface.  These would be the people to talk to and probably not the charity.
Also I'm not sure how bitcoin would help them other than the obvious cost saving.  They buy the materials overseas, ship them to the country involved, assemble on site using local labour and then give out the beds to the kids.  Point being 99% of their costs will probably be USD or CAD.
Still, if BlackBaud Inc can be convinced to extend their options then lots of charities would potentially benefit.

Gave some to my nephew and neice who are just a few years old so really it was to their parents for when they are older.
I generated a new wallet and printed the private key. This then went into a folded sheet of paper with their photograph on and a single sheet of foil inside (so you can't hold it up to the light). I then laminated the lot so the front has a nice picture and on the back there's a note showing the public key in QR format.
The idea is that they can open it when they are 18 and it will either be a neat novelty or something which pays for their education (or maybe just a new laptop/facebook vr/whatever 2030 brings).

I think the point here is that the Pools should pick an alligience and then let the miners choose if they want to switch or not and many miners will not care.
Pools have already tried offering a choice by offering miners the ability to mine using "alternate clients" with some success but the implication is that those miners staying with the core client are a mix of "don't care" and "I support core".  A pool supporting only one implementation forces the issue.

Mine does.  I can pay in at the desk and then withdraw from a cash point minutes later with 0 fees.  Or if I choose I can transfer to another account within my country for 0 fees.  The transfer completes within 15 minutes and the cash can be withdrawn immediately.
I have a monthly automatic transfer setup between two current accounts (both have debit cards) and that's 0 fee.  In total I have 3 debit card accounts all with 0 fee.
So what benefit does Bitcoin bring me ?  With Bitcoin I get a convenient payment method where if may payments details are stolen from a merchant.  For this I'm PAYING with Bitcoin a fee which for me is usually 0.  Plus of course the fees involved in exchanging Fiat to Bitcoin in the first place.
Sure there's the bonus of low cost international transfers but that's not something I need.  Not many people do unless they are migrant workers sending money home.

As far as I know slush hashing is automatically distributed based on your vote.
If you vote for Core then you hash core blocks and if you vote Classic you hash classic blocks so it's dynamic and there's no vote cut-off where the whole pool switches as one.
It's quite a neat solution I think.  Lets people's voice have an effect and you're not "electing a party".  
I think those that have voted "Don't Care" get their hash rate divided automatically between Core/Classic/Others based on the ratios at the moment.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:23:32
Well you could at one point and to a degree you still can but it's getting more problematic.
Bitpay and many others rely on so called "0 conf" transactions where the payments has been added to the network but hasn't been included in a block yet.  The principle is that they take it on good faith that for small transactions (say buying pizza) it's not worth someone's time to try and cheat the system and redirect the payment even if it's possible.  This is a risk merchants already take with credit card payments where the payment is a promise rather than full payment and they accept the risk that some payments might ultimately be rejected if they accept a bad card.
Unfortunately the Bitpay model is being undermined (rightly or wrongly) by recent changes such as RBF (replace-by-fee) which directly allows someone to over-ride an unconfirmed transaction with a new transaction paying a higher fee.
So people do still use it for spending but the who economy is changing. Some think for the better, some aren't so sure.

There are plenty of ways to sell and not just via exchanges but it's worth registering with a couple just in case.  Kracken are uk based and I've had some good experience with Bitstamp though with both it's a withdrawal via SEPA which has a one-off fee and also often currency conversion fees (eg EUR to GBP).
Another route is to use Neteller for the transfer (though they still want to do an ID verification) and you can deposit there as a BitPay payment which credits a GBP balance to your account.  After a bit of a delay (a couple of days I think) you can then withdraw directly to your linked bank account. I think there is a fee but I think it's cheaper than SEPA.  They also offer a debit card.
Lastly you could just spend them.  CEX accept bitcoin and so do Scan. Buy a big screen TV and a PS4 when we hit your cash out target ;)

Who is going to invest in hardware when you have just destroyed the business model for the last group of miners ?  Are you willing to sell your house and invest in hardware to secure bitcoin ?
The hash rate needs to be high to keep the financial barrier to entry high.  If the barrier to entry is too low then any idiot with access to enough servers could 51% Bitcoin.  This isn't realistic at the moment since a 51% attack would take a multi million dollar investment and not many people are willing to flush that much money down the drain (a 51% attacked Bitcoin network is of course instantly worthless).

Sure there's international transfers but most people don't need to worry about those.  Certainly the only international transfers I've made were to exchanges to buy Bitcoin in the first place.
I think international remittance could be the biggest win here but for this to work Bitcoin has to be appealing in users home countries in South America, Africa, Asia &amp; the poorer parts of Europe.  Consider that if the average income in a country is a 10x or 100x less than in the US (considering fees are usually discussed in dollars) then you need to adjust by that factor.  At 5 cents that's already equivalent to 50 cents or $5 in some countries.

Well if the principle is that it costs you money to sleep in then the money spent has to go somewhere you don't want it to go to be effective. A donation to charity wouldn't work properly in this case.
You get to sleep in and be charitable at the same time.
A more effective/evil solution would be an alarm clock that starts a timer and then fines you if you don't leave the house after xx minutes.  Say you set an hour from alarm to leaving the house and you are 15 minutes late then the system donates 15 x 0.001 BTC to miners (or better an organisation you dislike).  This comes with higher technical challenges though, the greatest of which reliably knowing if the person has left.

Ok so I have $100,000 to invest in mining and you have $1,000.
In an ASIC world that gets me 4 ASIC's at 20k each and you 0 ASIC's but maybe a share in a cloud mining operation.
In an GPU world that gets me 200 GTX 980s at $500 each and you 2 GTX 980s which is no different.
The miners with large sums to invest will **always** beat the ordinary guy in the street and a change to the POW will do nothing to change that.  The game changed once big money started to be spent and the development of ASIC's is natural.  Besides everyone seems to forget that FPGA's were used between the GPU and ASIC step and since they are reprogramable I doubt it's possible to code to exclude them.
@_date: 2016-05-06 15:17:29


People keep saying that but this isn't Linux and the simple fact is that unless you can get a critical mass of users (aka "consensus") your implementation is at a dead end.  Getting your idea into Core is a much more ideal approach but that has it's gate keepers.

For extra context this started with the "It's happening" meme every time Bitcoin went up more than 10% in a day....
@_date: 2016-05-24 16:05:02
Sorry, I think I might not have been clear so I'll try and explain myself better.  At the moment we have a high hash rate due to the pretty much exclusive use of efficient ASIC chips.  This high hash rate protects the network from "bad actors" that might want to undermine the network or 51% attack us because the investment required to compete is so high.
After a switch to GPUs we still need to have a high hash rate to keep this security.  It doesn't need to be quite as high since the ASIC chips won't exist but it need to be high enough to make the costs involved prohibitive. We don't want to be vunerable to a bot net, a hostile goverment or an intern with access to a high compute super computer.
How high this hash rate need to be is not something I feel qualified to calculate but as a guess lets say 10% of where we are now.  Bitcoin wisdom is currently reporting a hash rate of 1,675,865,031 GH/s so 10% is 167,586,503 GH/s and a GPU might do 1 Gh/s so 167 million GPU's would be needed to plug the gap.
Note :------  Well 167 million sounds insane so I'm not sure I've calculated it correctly !  1 Gh/s taken from the top single GPU time from the below link where an ATI 6990 quoted at 865 Mhash/s I rounded up to 1Gh/s.
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:35:00
Any GPU miner has moved on now to alts and as already pointed out some might move back to Bitcoin but to acheive the same hash rate we have now (&amp; the security that come with it) will require investment on a level that might move GPU prices again.
Of course this is ignoring FPGA's which everyone seems to have forgotten were the middle ground between the GPU and ASIC step.  Also reprogramable they will out class any GPU farm resulting in the a new set of FPGA miners who will be able to reprogram their hardware and adapt to future PoW changes.
Personally though I think changing the PoW is suicide.  There's a 1% chance the ideal scenario might work out and a 99% chance you'll see a mass exodus of investment, businesses and merchants.  Who is going to invest in a technology where the fundements are open to massive change and there is no stability ? It's like changing the IP packet format to create a "new" internet incompatible with the old.

Bitcoin has always had Trust.
Currently we "trust" that Core has the correct roadmap, that RBF will solve 0/low fee issues and that Segwit will solve capacity issues.
You can reduce the level of "trust" with additional knowledge by getting involved as a developer yourself and/or by taking part in detailed transactional analysis to see how these proposals hold up.  Few people in the community have the time/knowledge for that so we trust.
@_date: 2016-05-22 09:33:00

If what you propose becomes reality and Bitcoin survives (which I doubt) I think you'll just create an environment where everyone runs FPGA's instead of ASIC's.
Also mining will always gravitate to where the electricity is cheapest and for now this is China/Asia.  This should be no suprise in a global decentralised network and I think the community just has to accept this.

Nope. I can't see how that would work and it's economically self destructive.  It would make no sense for anyone in the network to process transactions then if they are **paying** to do so.
I consider myself a Bitcoin true believer since I was sold on the initial whitepaper and I would not be involved in this. Your first bullet point should then be more like "Followers of a PoW change".
I'm not sure why you think coins earned this way would be "cleaner" ignoring the reward coins earned from fees would be collected as normal but they would just not balance out the costs involved.
I don't understand your last point.
However I have a easier solution.... amend the code to restrict the mining to with Northern America.  Mining would then be unprofitable AND you would move mining out of China with no PoW change.  You could even rebrand as "PatriotCoin" or something ;)

@_date: 2016-05-24 09:35:28
It's worth noting that the block times vary too with a block sometimes being just a few minutes instead of 10 and on a few rare occasions it can take over 30 minutes for the network to add a new block.
Additionally at the moment the blocks are full so you need to have a high enough fee to get to the front of the queue.  Get this wrong and you might have to wait several blocks for your transaction to be picked up.
It wasn't always like this so not all the information out there reflects this.  Anything 2015 or older should be considered suspect and potentially out of date.

No problem, thank you for answering all my points fully and completely without bias.  Your in depth explanation of why a 2 mb HF was dropped from the roadmap in favour of just SW has really helped and I'm sure the OP will appreciate it too.

I tried reading this but my brain started to melt a little.
As such I have one question.  The contract contains this wording : "Inventors do hereby sell, assign, and transfer and have sold, assigned, and transferred to the Company, for itself and its successors, transferees, and assignees, the entire worldwide right, title, and interest in and to the following patent application(s): "
Does this retrospectively apply to all the past contributions the signee had made before joining Blockstream or is this just during their Blockstream employment or is this just from the date signed ?
Edit : Nevermind, I was fact finding leading up to a question which the FAQ pretty much answers :)

The size of a block of SegWit transactions isn't fixed and no amount of silly wordage changes it.
I'll repeat again just in case you missed it.  The original timeline included both the SW transaction format changes and an *actual* block size when it was known that SW provided a capacity benefit. Point being that SW providing a capacity increase isn't new so isn't relevant to "what changed".

Haha "conspiracy theories".... what ??
That's a totally legitimate question for a TEST NET. 
Did you even read the words ?

Just to highlight this is only true under perfect conditions where all transactions are SW formatted.  It's not the same as changing the hard blocksize limit to 2mb and probably shouldn't be mentioned in the same context.

It's good timing actually, ETH is effectivly trialing what BTC needs to do and all the problems they find can then be avoided when BTC forks.

You're comparing apples and pears here..... they are *nearly* the same thing but just not at the same thing. Besides 2mb is a guess, just as I've also seen estimates for "segwit capacity" around 1.6mb and 1.7mb.  Ok, *educated* guesses maybe but 2mb is far from an absolute figure.
This is a moot point anyway, the original timeline under discussion here was to have the *effective* capacity increase SW provides as well as an *actual* block size increase through a hard fork.
Both were on the table together and the OP's point stands.

Hmmm..... troll ?


So this started with..


No matter what you thought I meant by "fabricated" your reply helps nobody.  I think you'll find you are the troll in this situation :P

Ok great, thanks for the clarification :)
Upgrade ?  Well this is an aspect of the SW functionality, you only get to see blocks like this once everyone on the network has upgraded.  Or at least everyone adding transactions.

Thanks for the reply but I'd gotten the answer I wanted from the FAQ. I did edit to say so :)
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:00:57


Are these fabricated then to simply be a big as possible ?
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:10:26


Newsweek ?  Yeah he tried suing them for that, not sure how it worked out for him though.


I looked this up and you're correct but he isn't profiting from it :

After some thought I've decided you're attempting to draw me into a debate about segwit ignoring the original point about the road map so you're not worth my time.
The community has divisive issues and YOU are part of the problem.
