It's called a correction, and it's a natural element of every market's dynamic. They're quite common, and usually follow after large moves.

The author doesn't seem to understand the meaning of the word "fiat"; it means decree.  Also, the definition of money as a medium of exchange does not mean that it's widely used to be valid, just that it has the properties needed to be used as medium of exchange.

These people remind me of the religious zealots and Puritans of the past. The political and economic left of today is a mirror image of the religious right of the past, morality this morality that, guilt and virtue signaling ��

What if Bob has criticized the gooberment or isn't a Mao loving communist? Will his payment be processed or will his channel be allowed to remain open?? What if JD doesn't like him and thinks Bob's intentions are not pure or self righteous enough?  Will LN allow us to combat hate speech, racism or islamophilia ??

Look at a chart of the money supply pumped by the Fed if you want to see what a true bubble looks like. I'm sure he has no comment on that.
