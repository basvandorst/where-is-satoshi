At 2: it will also depend on how leveraged positions on Bitcoin owners are. If “safe money” is already here, it can keep, but if not people will liquidate...

The underlying fabric of society is Trust. You can decentralize, but there are gazillions of assets in the economy that derive its value from this exact thing.  
The trustlessness argument is short sighted and misinterpreted. Option of trustlessness is practical, not ideological per se.

There is one possible problem with this thinking in crypto and digital cash.
You fix a supply to a certain number. But then you can divide that denomination into Satoshis and derivatives with bridge currencies. Endless division of the fixed supply. 
Isnt that equivalent of inflation and hyperinflation?

Should be an option, but 99% will loose their keys.

Very nice when adoption is in effect. Getting access to future markets at low cost is amazing when you are running small business.

Whales need to be offloading now and others need to be stacking up. That's the only way to move in a direction. Otherwise Whales will end up worthless currency.   
Would be nice to hear from the coalition of whales of how they will take part in redistribution!

Sure, I understand your point, but I think your are focusing on one use case  that bitcoin and crypto/private key solve. But there are more use cases. Lets just work our way quickly through the 50 years. 
50ish: Cash was the only medium of exchange. (We had contracts too, but bitcoin doesn't Solve that albeit ETH does). People however like the notion of storing their money in the bank. They can keep it in a safe, the bank and the customer both hold a reccord of how much money the people own. They can withdraw cash when they want. Only in and out exchanges are traceable.
80 to 2010'ish: Credit cards and technology are introduced, and debet cards, wire transfers. Everything moves faster and life improves for many. However, in order to use these services you need to go through a party like a bank that needs to keep thorugh documents of all transactions to keep trace of the everyone holds. Digital cash isn't transferrable per sé. It's just a number in a ledger somewhere. 
However, people are fine with this. 99% of people don't care if someone can see where their money is spent, and it only matters if you're doing something illegal. Cash in hand is preferred by some, but it's just so much harder to work with. Sending it is unsafe, if you keep it in your home burglars might take it, you might loose it in fire, you might misplace it, or your family members might try to steal it from you, little by little. 
Keeping everything in the bank makes sense for most. You still have the option of cash, gold or whatever, but electrical transfers via centralized authority have an advantage. 
2010's-future: 
Bitcoin introduces technology that can give medium of exchange both the upside of having technology as well as behaving like cash. This doesn't mean that banks will die...as they offer services mostly. But now users can have the option of withdrawing their electrical cash without exhanging it for printed notes. 
This offers freedom. That means the freedom to choose. That is AMAZING and the opportunities it opens up for business and society. 
However, people "normies" and others, really don't care about the stealth and privacy issues, because they don't understand them. So...those who understand, like many in here, and probably yourselve, are needed to build that system for the greater good and freedom for individuals.
