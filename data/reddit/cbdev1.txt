Nope. Wait until amazon accepts it as payment, then we can talk about fast growth... Expect 1K+ in a day

It feels like Microsoft vs Apple in the mobile phone wars. China is just missing the boat.

I still think Coinbase.com is the simplest and easiest way to buy bitcoin.
Once you signup you'll have to show proof of your identity with a drivers license or passport and you'll have to verify your bank account or credit card. 
A quick tip if using credit card... If you call the number on the back of the credit card you can ask them for the latest payments to get processing done as soon as they send the verification amounts, If you wait for the transactions to show up in your internet banking it can take over 48 hours.
Hope this helps, there are other exchanges but i've found they aren't as friendly or easy for a beginner.
