It's hardware dependant, with multi-core processors gaining a higher increase over single cores. The extra speed comes from multiple tweaks to cut out unnecessary steps in the mining process.
I really can't go too indepth into it without basically giving it away, but it's essentially months of code optimisation. 
The average user would probably experience a hashrate raise somewhere around 6-7%.

I haven't yet got around to registering there and posting about it, I'll be doing that tomorrow though.
I've been following the bitcoin subreddit for several months now, but haven't needed to register up until this point.

I understand, however right now I'd like to keep my code optimisation private until I develop it further, I don't fancy having someone steal 3 months of my work.

I'm making a post on Bitcointalk right now. I haven't really been active in the bitcoin community before so I guess it can look suspicious.

No problem, I'll give it some serious thought and may release the source by the end of the week.

I never have any intentions of charging for my software, I just want to keep my code private for the time being. As I release new updates I may put out the source for older versions.

This is absolutely true, you should always be suspicious of anything you're downloading, I can assure everyone though that I have no mal-intent.

Since I'm using some code optimisation that I haven't yet seen in any other miner I'm not yet willing to go open-source.
