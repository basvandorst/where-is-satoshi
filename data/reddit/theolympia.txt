Interesting to see just how many companies are jumping on the nfc thing now! Almost like a minimum standard for mobile wallets.

Bigger problem for Greece could just be holding together as a country first. New election for them now, more unstable financially.

The first rule of Bitcoin, is that it's not very interesting to outsiders.

What is the KNC fraud? I see the article mentions they are to be sued by their customers?

Any help possible for this situation is good in my opinion.

"Utah is one of three US states where politicians are currently fielding legislation aimed at getting the local government to accept Bitcoin payments, alongside New Hampshire, and New York."
Hopefully this has some motivating effect for the other states thinking about having similar bills, or at least that supporters there are able to point to this and say, hey this is going on here and we could do it too.

This is where it went wrong, they saw so much money going past in front of them to the others, and how can they say no when it seems so anonymous and so easy to get.

The guy behind it seems like he means to improve the financial responsibility though, his aim is  'increasing consumer protections' and by doing this bill he would be making the companies more responsible in the same way which traditional financial companies are held now?

"“It's been on for 5 days and 3% of our web payments have been made in bitcoin. I'm inclined to believe that the percentage will drop as the dust settles, and that for a long time practically all of those who pay with bitcoin would be able to pay with Euros too.”
"there still “aren't many places yet to use bitcoin” "
So he see's it as sweeping up people's Bitcoin who were probably going to buy something anyway, but have these bitcoin they're stuck with because there's nowhere to use them?

Seems like a bad way to bring in trust to something that has the chance to not need it!
