Am noob, can confirm. I have no clue what segwit is and use coinbase because it's easy and appears to be secure. 
Just to give you guys an outsider's perspective, the biggest thing that reassured me about Coinbase was the VC firms funding it. I know they will want to make their money by IPO, not by stealing my coins in the dead of night. Any breaches of security hurt the value of their investment and their ROI.
If another exchange popped up HQ'd somewhere in Eastern Europe and the ownership was opaque, no amount of technical superiority would make me switch. I'd be too worried about insiders deciding it was easier to just take my wallet than run a business.

Where do you recommend buying, using what service?

There is a middle ground. You could have a mandated insurance program without backing the currency with the full faith and credit of the government. Case in point: banks themselves fund the FDIC -- it receives no funding from Congress.

The same criticism could be leveled at gold couldn't it?

There's no way to know, but it would be interesting to find out the ratio of "core users" to investors treating bitcoin like it's the latest penny stock. My guess is that the latter far outnumbers the former.

So true. It's human nature. That's why people like Warren Bufffett are so rare: he invested in financial institutions at the height of the panic during the 2008 financial crisis and ended up making a cool $10 billion in profits. He was able to see that companies with significant value were on sale.
