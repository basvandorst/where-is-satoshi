I agree with what you’re saying - but your last comment. You actually replied to two separate people, neither of whom have promoted bitcoin cash from their accounts - in fact one of them has actively made posts criticising bitcoin cash.
Look, if you don’t like bitcoin cash (like most of us at r/bitcoin) then don’t use it. The market will decide - and so far its strongly favouring us anyway. You don’t need to resort to slandering people just for having a different viewpoint.

Depends on your financial situation. For me, $240 would mean I can't eat for 2 months.

That’s really generous of you! Thank you!! ��

Side note: any idea how to force my node to use ipv4 rather than ipv6? It makes it very difficult for others to discover my node otherwise :(
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:06:09
No problem :) you have to have a channel open to make a payment
This 5min video does a really good job of explaining the lightning network: 
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:56:55
Ahhhh okay sorry I’m running c-lightning - have you opened a payment channel, not just connected?
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:58:44
Will do!
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:43:16
I'm using c\-lightning, and yeah the problem is that the software runs fine using ipv6 but doesn't show my ipv6 address either with 'getinfo' or on any of the web\-based lightning network explorers (nor for any other node that used ipv6), which is an issue as it means that I can't give directions for others to connect to my node!

I thought the /s was implied...

As soon as I’m back from college I’ll post the node ID here for you! ��

...what? I'm guessing you don't live in London!


But still incredibly rare. It is ridiculously unlikely that you'll be attacked, let alone with acid.


Just stop dude. Tommy Robinson broke the conditions of his parole \- that's why he went to prison. The same as anyone else who violates the conditions of their parole.

Run ‘listpeers’ and see if it says ‘gossiping’ or ‘channeld_normal’

Okay - blockstream's node is called 'SLEEPYARK' and is reachable at:

Personally I wouldn't even consider running this on a personal machine unless I had it completely isolated from the rest of my network. Not worth the risk at all.

Literal chills guys 
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:12:48
Sure! When I get a chance I’ll post up the links and videos that I used. I found that none of the guides were entirely correct about what needed to be done, so I picked and chose fragments from
different guides where needed. If I get time I might even write up my own guide / experiences if that’s helpful?
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:24:01
Wow! Thank you!! That’s quite a lot, did you mean to send that much haha? :)
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:07:02
Nice! Thanks I'll have a look through it :)
Also \- connected in 'gossiping' state now (haven't opened a channel yet as I'm low on funds for that haha, and I'm not sure I want to risk more in the lightning network just yet!)
