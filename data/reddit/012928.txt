Guess what? Our USD is no longer backed by gold. It's backed by 'trust', just like Bitcoin. Also ask the people of Cyprus how much a government backing means. It means as much as the trust people put into it.

Confirmations from the blockchain eliminate forged transactions. This is why people fear a 51% attack as anyone who controls the majority of the network could potentially exploit the blockchain through confirmations. Correct me if I'm wrong.

@_date: 2014-03-29 23:31:32
Keep it as simple, yet  as descriptive as possible. If you focus on the algorithms and how it's used, how to get it / where to spend it that'd probably be what people would want to hear. I also think people would find mining interesting.

Nothing is ever safe. But it is NY based, and have had people review them such as Blockchains Andreas Antonopoulos over to verify their cold storage, which makes me a bit more apt to leave my coins there if need be and not get Gox'd as easily.

I mine in a profit switching pool with 2.5MH/s and am not getting 0.1BTC a day. Thinking you can mine more than that using your CPU is pretty unlikely. Your plan only works if you're extremely lucky and one takes off exponentially in value.

You've clearly been around a while haha. I made the mistake of waiting last dip by waiting when it was 540 (last dip) and ended buying at 578 when it headed back to the 650 last tip.
Good idea my man, good idea.

I do it because it pays better and nets me more coins. Even if a pool takes a percentage of my personal profits I am making more than on my own/another pools profits so I'm still happy.
Betting on a pool getting a block sounds cool in theory, but then you have to get into specifics. What about multipools? What block are we betting on? Every block? 'x' blocks a day? Week? What profit margin are we looking at?
Seems like a lot of work when I can just point my rig at a multipool and let it run unmanned for weeks and collect profits based on the pools work/algorithm.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:42:45

They wont invest until there is a lot less volatility in the market. Having China adopt it would bring tons of new users and help to balance out the huge volatility of the market sooner than waiting for more users here and in other countries to adopt.
Banning it in China would do little to help the market ~~maintain~~ regain stability.
