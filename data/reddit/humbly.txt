I use armory on an offline computer using linux with truecrypt and other encryption. It rocks. My online computer is an i7 8GB SSD and the online armory runs fine. A lesser machine might struggle though. They might fix that later though...

As time goes to infinity, everyone gets hacked. That is a great argument. The only problem is the collapse of the sun by several orders of magnitude sooner than generating a fraction of the possible private keys.
And yes, this will be a very important issue once I've developed immortality. I think we should build immortality into the existing bitcoin protocol now so we are ready.

They wait a few (more than a couple and less than 8 or so) seconds before accepting the transaction provided no others appear. Noone is going to accept a transaction after seeing the first one.
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:23:41
zero confirmation transactions will be accepted (with appropriate fees) because it will be extremely expensive to double-spend provided the transaction is &lt; $10k. Therefore the transaction time will be a couple of seconds or so.

But the women in feminine product adverts are usually hot.
I'm happy with TV and radio ads since I don't use either. People can advertise to me that they now accept bitcoin through but I don't want targeted advertising.
It would be great if there was a medium for people to advertise their services that people could actively select to view and people could scan it to learn what is available. But I don't like forced viewings.

If they need another digit to represent bitcoin fractions, just about everyone holding bitcoin would be very very rich. 1 cent is 1000 satoshi now approximately. If they need a resolution of 1 cent minimum, then the value would need to increase over a thousand before we need to do that.

I'm going to throw this out there. A stealth address is a way to let someone pay money to somewhere that the receiver can find and have the public and private key for. The payee provided information for the stealth address such that they can determine the public and private key but payer can only determine a public/receive address. The payee didn't specify that exact receive address but can scan a valid range to find it based on a shared secret between payer and payee. The mechanism is designed so that only the payee will have the private key of the destination address.

Servers could individually fake balances. They wouldn't have necessarily have mined a block to be forgoing a 25 btc reward. It is less likely for multiple servers to do this.

It's difficult because fiat sucks. Getting bitcoin is easy technically speaking, finding a way to give someone something that they think is worth handing over bitcoin is a pain in the ass. With alt currencies, it is easy to trade for bitcoin and quick...but you still have that initial problem with fiat.

Correct. No adverts or just completely nothing to do with my data. Targeted advertisers can duck off.
I don't want to go to a subway station and for the adverts to automatically change to target my interests. I don't want the same thing from the internet.
If I search for something, it can give an advert related to the search item. But I am annoyed if I'm getting adverts from unrelated searches over the past several weeks.

This isn't about blaming the victim, it's about giving up on bitcoin because of a bad exchange when the entire bitcoin community hates that exchange as well. We feel for your loss. It isn't ponzi-like. Ponzi is when you offer returns on your investment that are not possible and early investors are paid off by the deposits of later investors. There are no promises with bitcoin and considerable risk. It *might* go up in value but can easily go down. People generally advise not investing more into bitcoin than you can afford to lose.
