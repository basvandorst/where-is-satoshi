You can "top up" with other LN transactions.  Think of settlements on the main chain like taking someone to Court.  Doesn't happen that often.  
Also, there is no reason that the block size cannot increase in the future when other hardware and software improvements allow for it without compromising decentralization.
Further, MAST, Schnorr Signatures, other layers, batch processing, etc. can all increase throughput on the main chain.

To infringe this patent, you must do all of the following (the other independent claims are similar):
1. A system comprising: a memory operable to: store a customer account associated with a customer; store a first float account associated with an enterprise; store a second float account associated with the enterprise; and a processor communicatively coupled to the memory, the memory including executable instructions that upon execution by the processor cause the system to: receive an electronic request for a currency exchange from the customer, the request requesting to exchange a first currency for a second currency, wherein the second currency is a cryptocurrency; determine a first cryptocurrency public key associated with the customer account; determine a second cryptocurrency public key associated with the second float account; determine a cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account; determine a plurality of exchange rates for exchanging the first currency for the second currency; determine, based at least in part upon the plurality of exchange rates, an optimal exchange rate; and in response to determining the optimal exchange rate: determine, based at least in part upon the electronic request, a first amount of the first currency; associate the first amount of the first currency with the customer account; transfer the first amount of the first currency into the first float account, the first float account associated with the first currency; determine, based at least in part upon the optimal exchange rate, a second amount of the second currency; associate, using the second cryptocurrency public key associated with the second float account, the second amount of the second currency with the second float account, the second float account associated with the second currency; and transfer, using the cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account and the first cryptocurrency public key associated with the customer account, the second amount of the second currency from the second float account to the customer; generate a first vault key based at least in part upon the cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account, wherein generating the first vault key comprises applying a first hash function to a first portion of the cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account; generate a second vault key based at least in part upon the cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account, wherein generating the second vault key comprises applying a second hash function to a second portion of the cryptocurrency private key associated with the second float account; store the first vault key at a first location; and store the second vault key at a second location.

Yes, this is a regulated security with the bitcoin held by Xapo, iirc.  They take a 2% management fee, which is high, but 1) the convenience of offloading custodianship while simultaneously being able to trade quickly on a brokerage, and 2) being able to hold in tax-advantaged accounts more than makes up for this fee, imo.

@_date: 2018-05-03 17:02:43
I would point out that this is a way to keep the ability to trade quickly while not keeping your bitcoin on an exchange.  Your money is with a brokerage, but these guys are under strict regulation and the bitcoin is all cold-storage with Xapo.  So, some advantage there.

For those who aren't patent attorneys like Pinochet here, a PCT is an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).  You can't get an "international patent", but filing a PCT is a convenient first step in filing in individual countries later on.
The patent claims the following is the invention:
1. A computer- implemented method of controlling the visibility and/or performance of a contract, the method comprising the steps:
(a) storing a contract on or in a computer-based repository;
(b) broadcasting a transaction to a blockchain, the transaction comprising:
i) at least one unspent output (UTXO); and
ii) metadata comprising an identifier indicative of the location where the contract is stored; and
(c ) renewing or rolling the contract on by:
generating a new key using data relating to a previous key associated with the contract;
generating a script comprising the new key, the location of the contract and a hash of the contract; and
paying an amount of currency to the script.

Kind of, but you shouldn't think of it as "locking up" the funds, because it is available to use anywhere on the lightning network.  I like to think of it more like unlocking your coins (obviously this gets more true the larger the network gets, like all network effects).  Think of the original bitcoin layer as a kind-of arbitration layer.  We don't go to court very often, but it's a useful layer to have.

If both parties have no other channels, you are correct, the funds are "locked up".  Otherwise, those funds can still go out the other side.  And in real cases, you would expect at least a couple connections.  Think about a more mature network where you likely have a connection to, say, your employer, maybe a bank, and maybe a store like amazon.  Now everything is super free-flowing.
Someone does need to pay an initial transaction fee to open the channel, but right now that's cents.

Treat it just like a stock for these purposes until other guidance is given.  A transaction counts as a sale for now, so capital gains is due on the amount at time of transaction.  Donations can be treated like donations of stock (this is fairly advantageous, and if you re-buy what you donate, you are effectively increasing your basis, assuming price has gone up since your original purchase).
If it's less than a year, it's short-term capital gains.  It's taxed as ordinary income at the time you receive bitcoin if you mined it or if you received it for the sale of goods or services.

Get an account at Coinbase or Gemini.  Enable 2-factor authentication.  Buy bitcoin.  If you buy a lot, buy a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet and transfer your bitcoin there.  Otherwise keep it on Coinbase or Gemini.  If you have an IRA, you may also consider buying some GBTC which gives exposure to bitcoin in a tax-advantaged account.

New shares that are created are sold at or about par value.  They cannot be sold over the counter for a year.  You have to be an accredited investor to buy new shares.  Anyone can buy over the counter shares.  These trade at a premium because there is a demand for the product and a limited supply (because newly created shares are not available for a year).  Why would people demand this product?  Lots of reasons.  Individual investors would buy because they can hold in a tax-advantaged account like a Roth IRA.  That's worth paying a premium.

Correct.  I believe Xapo is their holder.
