I think I might do that when my current project ( is officially launched. Aren't there already such services available though?

Personally, I found that the easiest way is to write down the seed phrase of an Electrum wallet on a piece of paper. By the way, I'm working on a service that can monitor cold wallets and send SMS notifications when something happens, thought it might interest you:  (scoop: support for Armory coming tomorrow)

Yep, that could definitely work. Here's some more thoughts around this: 
I think using a SMS credit system like you described would be a good start. By the way, subscribe to the mailing list if you'd like to get notified when this is implemented.

I predict that within 5 years, 50%+ of Bitcoin users will use dedicated hardware wallets for signing transactions combined with "watch-only" wallets on less safe devices (smartphones, laptops, etc.).
@_date: 2014-05-11 04:27:37
I utterly missed that word. Fixed.
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:46:40
Yep, should be added in next few days :)

Reddit != real world. I also just checked the Google trends and Bitcoin is not losing to dogecoin by a long shot.

To be honest, I haven't been following much what is going on in China but I thought it was worth sharing. It was given to me by a BoC employee who knows me and knows that I'm involved with Bitcoin.

Weird, I can't see my comments for some reason and thought it didn't get sent.

Let's imagine that a group of people did come together and did form a foundation. Let's say those people were regularly invited to government hearings or to talk to journalists. Let's also imagine that those people claimed to represent the Bitcoin community. Is there something we should do about it?

What server do you use to retrieve transactions?
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:42:26
Hey, I'm not sure if this really answers your question but I'm working on a service that might interest you. Basically it's a "watch only" online wallet. It lets you monitor your wallet from anywhere but it doesn't have the ability to spend (i.e. even if I wanted to, I couldn't steal your coins and nor could a hacker). What most people do is set up a cold wallet on a non networked device (old computer, cheap smart phone, etc.) using Electrum and only sign transactions on that device when they really need to (to refill a hot wallet for example). 
What I recommend is to keep most of your balance in a cold wallet and keep a "hot" wallet with a small amount of Bitcoin that you refill periodically (on your laptop or on blockchain.info for example). 
Here's the URL of the service I'm working on by the way:  (coming soon: SMS/email notifications when transactions happen)

Wow, that's a pretty big endorsement. This guy is the Warren Buffet of Asia. (It's not exactly news though, he invested in BitPay back in 2013)

Bitcoin is not ready for superbowl yet. We need better wallets and a better eco-system.
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:09:54
Yes exactly. As mentioned, we are also working on notifications / API and other cool stuff like this. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:03:18
Hey I hope I'm not too spammy with those posts. I'd love to hear your feedback and see what features you guys think would be cool. What I'm working on right now: make it possible for charities who accept Bitcoin to embed a view of their wallet directly on their website (for full transparency).
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:44:38
Thanks! SMS seems to be the most requested service, I think I should move it on top of my priority list :) I haven't really thought about how to implement it, do you have suggestions? I was thinking of integrating with the Twilio API.

Let's first discuss about what evidence there is that "Dogecoin is winning over Bitcoin".

Armory support almost implemented. Should be available in next 48 hours!

You could use an Electrum wallet and give your auditor the master public key. As a matter of fact, I am working on a service that might make such audits a bit easier (
