I don't care to give it attention. Either someone bought it, or someone is pretending it changed hands and could change it back.
It's a tainted account, fuck it.

Yes. Happened right after Jamie D of JP Morgan said 'it's a scam'. This way he looked like he was protecting investors, but actually he was securing cheap China coins and deterring competition.

We need another Edward Snowden to know if it ever stopped being the case, frankly.

Snowden did not 'leak' to Wikileaks. He specifically does not agree with the Wikileaks policy of (near) blanket declassification.
(Sort of oddly) Snowden ONLY leaked to 4 (or so) specific individuals who worked at major news publications. You can literally watch:
[Citizen 4](
Which is the REAL Snowden, leaking the REAL documents, in Real Time.
If you don't know who Snowden is, he is an X-Military officer, and son of a Military Officer. He supported (to some degree) Hillary over Trump. He strongly dislikes Trump (and Putin). Snowden largely 'plays ball', in terms of his leak. He views himself as someone who is trying to protect the nation, not destroy it. He is not 'anti-America', anti-big corp, anti-spying. All he wanted was actual due process, of some sort, for spying. And, also, to remove 'blanket surveillance' which is the NSA default procedures.
For example, there are say 50,000 people working at the NSA. There are (say) 3 Billion 'data users' throughout the world. By default, the NSA literally records near everything. Rather than investigating a person AFTER they become suspicious, they record everything on the assumption they MAY become suspicious, and then look through historical logs afterwards.
This process is largely unsupervised, and the spouses of NSA associates and their extramarital lovers have got spied upon quite a bit, primarily for personal reasons of the employee.
Again, their is no need to 'request spy data', it's always there, and high level NSA people can access it. Snowden was given the special project of coordinating all the databases to work with one another, that is why he was able to get back door access and copy all database files.
He fled the country within hours, and left without notifying anyone, and presumed he'd likely die in the process.
"Snowden" by Oliver Stone, showcases a lot of this information well.
I should add only 1 to 5% of the Snowden leaks have been shared with the public. In contrast, Wikileaks shared round 98% of [Collateral Murder]( - [Official Site]( only withholding active military personnel and targets. I think at this point 100% has been shared, with only minor redaction. Collateral Murder was leaked by [Chelsea Manning]( - and for those who can't watch the videos, it effectively showed American Troops in live 'combat' situations in helicopters who were (effectively) just indiscriminately killing civilians for playing or walking outside their homes. This is a pretty good run down of [what the world was like in 2010]( set to a song, and was some of the inspiration for the Snowden leaks.

And by resist, we mean put in the time to study code (such as Mastering Bitcoin), and then spending free time ~~creating Vegeta memes~~ organizing projects to work on, pushing down work assignments, and contributing work.

There will be a huge consolidation within 3 years. I suspect the consolidation will happen with Bitcoin, but it could be over another network. There are many important user oriented adoptions which will take shape soon. The network which implements these best will gain advantage.
To peer into the future, one must first seek Mental Transaction Cost and Micro Payment understanding. Good luck :)
