From wikipedia - digital currency:
"It differs from virtual money used in virtual economies due to its use in transactions with real goods and services; not being limited to circulation within online games."
So the correct term is digital currency and not virtual currency

It's better to create a new armory wallet because they are deterministic where the Bitcoin-Qt wallets are not. And you can't be sure that your wallet hasn't already been stolen...
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:36:23
remember to add them to coinmap.org once they accept it.

Would be nice to be able to choose the bitcoin implementation from a list, at some future time.
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:47:51
a krypto euro or dollar cannot beat bitcoin because bitcoin has no central authority and about the fact that price fluctuates so much, it will stabilize with time.
@_date: 2014-01-06 09:07:15
Please add it to coinmap.org for more visibility
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:04:21
is it on coinmap.org?
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:30:56
What? No way! I thought no one would spend any bitcoins. Thats how deflationary currencies work! (theoretic destortion field effect)

Great work coinbase!
From the article:
“When I was saying we’d be accepting Bitcoin within 6 months, I thought that would be it,” he says. But Bitcoin money processors began approaching the company, wanting to partner with it and telling the company it could get Bitcoin going sooner. Coinbase beat out its competitors by promising to fly talent to Salt Lake City to help Overstock get their payment platform up and running. Afraid that he had tipped his hand by telling the press about the company’s Bitcoin plans, Byrne decided to make it happen as soon as possible.

use the blockchain.info firefox or chrome extension to prevent altered JS code

Coinmap.org is better because it uses open street map data instead of google maps. And every business added to coinmap.org is added to openstreetmap.org so that future websites or apps can use that data.

Right. Nixon removed the gold standard in 1971 because the federal reserve printed more dollars than available gold reserves. And when countries like france, germany, italy and so on started to claim back gold by giving back US dollars, Nixon had to remove the gold backing to avoid a world wide currency collapse, because most of foreign countries based their paper money on the dollar, and the US scammed other contries for the second time.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:17:54
actually a very good honest article.
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:00:50
Thanks for bringing that up.
When you hear or read about bitcoin it seems that Satoshi Nakamoto was an alien genius crazy man with unseen skills and sense for perfection.
It's nice to see that the community made the difference.
They ported the code to other systems and cleaned up the code and closed serious vulnerabilities. This is what I love about bitcoin, reminds me earely internet and linux...

if you enable 2 factor authentication (for example by using google authenticator) you are a lot safer. But 100% security doesn't exist. Best strategy is to keep low amounts in blockchain.info wallet and move high amounts to paper wallets using bitaddress.org.
You can generate secure paper wallets by using a live cd of a linux distribution like Linux Mint, so you avoid windows keyloggers/malware etc...
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:43:29
MAybe you could add it to coinmap.org for more visibility :)
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:42:37
yes, there were people selling real cash (paper dollars) for bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-11-04 11:25:23
And bitadress.org supports encrypted paper wallets for advanced security

I read somewhere (think coindesk) that bitcoin-qt may implement faster blockchain sync (by downloading headers only).
My question:
If you use a brainwallet or electrum's deterministic generation tool, how are change addresses handled? If I send say 0.75 BTC from a deterministic wallet which has a total of 1 BTC, will the change be lost when restoring the wallet from the deterministic phrase? Change address is different usually so in theory deterministic/brain wallets are useful only for 1 transaction with no change, right?
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:51:26
Not going to work. How can you test bitcoin payments for your service without letting anyone know that you accept bitcoin?
To implement the API through Bitpay or Coinbase takes very little effort. Why not give it a serious try?
That's just to say, ah yeah Bitcoin! Ya, we tried that, but...
I hope they get enough requests so that they'll implement it for real.

@_date: 2013-04-05 20:34:30
yes, if you need to be safe:
1. Use blockhain.info as spending wallet
2. Use a paper wallet for long term secure store
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:50:55
Agree, BUT they charge a fee for their mixing service, so at least thei should answer support tickets concerning that field...
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:19:51
Bitcoin is not mainly used because of micro-transactions, but because of:
1. No central authority
2. No "money printing on demand"
3. Pseudo anonymity + privacy
4. you name it...
