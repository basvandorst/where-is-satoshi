Prefer Coinspot despite higher fees. Never had problems with BTC Markets although a friend lost her coins on there because she didn't use 2Fa.
Cashed out my wife's crypto in mid-2018 (she thought it was a scam), but I've just bought and held for the last 2 years. They also have a feature where you can lock coins on their exchange (can only withdraw after sending a written letter to confirm). But I just buy and download to Trezor. Small amounts of alts I occasionally download to iPhone Enjin app.

Libra would only work if Zuckerberg handed control over to the IMF. Zuckerberg wouldn't want that, but he might be forced to. If that happens, expect Zuckerberg to resign and start some philanthropy like Bill Gates did. The IMF can't regulate BTC, but might use BTC to replace US$ as the international store-of-value currency with the Libra rebranded as a tethered bankcoin. They'll use Libra to replace Tether and buy up even more BTC than the owners of Tether did. That way, governments can regulate both tethered bankcoins and BTC. By then most others altcoins (ETH, LTC, BCH, etc) will be killed by tethered bankcoin manipulations.
(Just my opinion)

100 Satoshi = 1 cent. I get that part. Don't think anyone outside of crypto will have a clue. They'll think "Does $1 = One Hundred Satoshi?" 
Not only that, but its dangerous to entertain the idea of blending fiat notes with crypto. Next thing that might happen is that the Federal Reserve will think it a good idea to print Satoshi notes. That way they can do quantitative easing on Bitcoin with their printing machines and destroy it. Call me paranoid or over-caffeinated but I'd be surprised if I'm the only one thinking this.

Increase by 20-30 fold not that dramatic. Just means BTC will surge to $180,000 by end of 2021/early 2022. Then dump within 18 months to about $30,000. Such things aren't outside logarithmic behaviour. But eventually global adoption will hamper logarithmic growth. Keep hodling.

The ethos of crypto was to have a decentralized currency that is immune to centralized bank and government abuse which causes unending 'quantative easing', devaluation and hyperinflation. Unlike the $, 1 Bitcoin will always equal 1 Bitcoin.
Bitcoin can only be compared to gold in terms of its robustness, resistance to attacks and immunity to inflation. It was never intended to be anonymous as many on Silk Road falsely assumed.
It's likely to be robust enough to eventually be used by banks and end the financial tyranny we currently live with.
It's bad news for government control of finance and likely a death-knell to Keynesian economics.

BTC is my plan B. Small amount in bank, and buying BTC every week. You still need to factor in other things like rent/mortgage, groceries, holidays. The best part of BTC is that it has highlighted my discretionary spending. If I'm thinking of spending $40 on a car wash or upgrading my phone or a new set of headphones, instead I just spend it on BTC. If your wasting it on cigarettes, booze, blow or hookers, you're not thinking long term. I don't know if BTC will still be around in ten years, but I'm still holding until I don't need it any more, which is when I retire in 5 years. &lt;foolish baby boomer&gt;

Bitcoin's scarcity is what drives its price upward. If you could print more Bitcoin on demand, its price would never go above $1.00 (like many altcoins). The price ceiling for scarcity is set at nosebleed levels only if there is still blood and sweat in the system (mining) and can be bled occasionally.
Because of scarcity, holding coins magnifies value. But if overheld, holding will eventually reduce number of interested buyers, thus devaluing price long-term. Bitcoin needs constant buy/sell movement to maintain liquidity.
Bitcoin could only crash permanently if there was a better store of value or if quant computers could mine entire bitcoin remainder in a day.

The coin should be the final nail in the coffin about cryptocurrency being rat poison. It totally validates the whole crypto arena, but FB users will still need educating that
1) Libra is a stablecoin - won't accrue interest but can be used as a place to hold money as an asset (bank the unbankable) which can be redeemed as fiat or other cryptos.
2) Being centralised and inflationary, is the opposite of Bitcoin and is not owned by the FB user.

They said this when Tesla invented AC/DC. "Man, you mean when have to run wires all over the country? That's too hard!" Scaling just takes time and money.

I bought 0.0001 BTC. That's what triggered the pump.

Only got into bitcoin in 2017. Since then, been buying small amount weekly. I find that also having a mortgage forces me to be disciplined. This translates to religiously working and saving and budgeting even when there are days when I don't want to work, or pay attention to bills. Bitcoin may turn me into a millionaire in ten years time but by then I'd see it as nothing more than a "lifetimes worth of groceries." I've never owned a new car and even if I was a millionaire, the thought of wasting it on a Lamborghini doesn't make sense. At best, Bitcoin is a security blanket, getting rid of fears of debt. If I rely on Bitcoin to make me happy in the future, I'll never be happy. Work, family, friends - these things have always been the most valuable commodities. Stay humble, guys.

"Upside (5-yr) In BTC ($96k), XMR ($18k), and DCR ($535)"
Fascinating that most other altcoins are considered worthless by Bloomberg analysts.

Probably took 24 hrs to transfer at that fee rate. Binance probably happy to wait.

That's insulting to sociopaths. He's just got NPD (narcissistic personality disorder).

"The Bitcoin Standard" by [Saifedean Ammous]( The best kindle book that covers the emergence of currencies from shells to gold, fiat and crypto.

They just increase their fees to cover new fines. The cost of doing business.
