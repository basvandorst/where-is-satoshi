My God... If you think you need to add gold (with no growth prospects) to a portfolio to make it diversified ��‍♂️��‍♂️��‍♂️
I hope you aren't young, because a mistake like this will kill you in the long term.
A dollar in the market will double in 7 years, and will double again in another 7 years. 
A dollar in gold will be... about 1 dollar in 7 years.

Gold is a dumb investment. You obviously don't believe me, so go do some research.
No competent investor has any of their portfolio in gold. Cash would even be a better option, as you can simply invest more in the market when it is down.
There is no value to gold, as an investment, or otherwise. Sorry.

No... We didn't... Because it's a conspiracy theorist YouTube video.
Did you see them testify, and how dumb the GOP members of our government are? They didn't understand one iota of how modern technology works.
It's great that there's still idiots like you, and those GOP members to laugh at

Gold often fails to even keep up with inflation, and is one of the worst long term investments you can make. Basic index funds like the S&amp;P CRUSH gold in the short, mid, and long term.
Gold is what idiots buy. It's like something trump would invest in thinking "its a classic, it HAS to be a good investment!"
Edit: Holy shit, you guys are dumb. I'll bet you're actually telling the truth when you say you've YOLO'd your entire portfolio to bitcoin.
GOLD. IS. A BAD. INVESTMENT.
Not a single major index out there has failed to CRUSH gold in returns in the short, medium, or long term. Look even longer (50+ years) and gold becomes LAUGHABLY bad.
If you're shilling gold on people, you're even dumber than you think those "suckers" are.
So. So. Dumb.

Explain away those numbers, ya dinguses
