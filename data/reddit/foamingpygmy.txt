Not all Chinese products are crap. I try to work with companies that are ethical with their workers and environment, manufacturing quality products made with recyclable materials. Japan and Taiwan made crappy toys and products in the 60s but ended making the best microelectronics by the 90s. All countries have humble beginnings and slowly improve their wages, education, industry, products, work ethics, etc.
China imho is in that same process, in a crossroads between pollution and quasi slave labor and a search for ethics and quality. I can make mistakes but in my store I strive to separate one from the other, I search for manufacturers that have passed international inspections and receive [quality certifications from companies like SGS]( 
There's more information about the process I follow for selecting the companies I work with and their products in [My Mission and Commitment]( and [How I Select My Products]( pages.

Thanks for reporting it bluesnsouls. Seems the website had a traffic peak yesterday and it couldn't serve all visitors. Still giving you a 403?

bluesnsouls reported that he is getting a 403 consistently. anarcoin could you check if you're still getting a 404 error? I want to be sure it is not because of a server misconfig and I'm blocking quite a number of my visitors. Thanks.

Thanks nate, it's a small store and I'm still a long way to make it what I want it to be but I'll do my best to give a great service and customized attention to those of you who decide to buy.

You mean the logo with the Lotus flower? :-/

Yeah, it seems the website had quite a peak yesterday now that I'm looking at the stats. Quite surprised about that... :)

I'm still learning about crypto and it's a bit of work to implement payments in the store but I'm currently considering to run my own node or use a payment processor to do this.
I thought about using bech32 addresses for the payments but perhaps it could give incompatibilities for some customers so I use segwit. For now that's what I currently accept, in the future I hope to improve the payment system.

Thanks for your help, I think some security rule blocked you based on your User Agent but not sure. I've sent you a message with one last favor to ask.

You are entitled to your own opinion but I always choose the products I sell based on scientific research. I verify that complementary therapies work, that product's ingredients are natural (plant extract based) and have been proven by medical studies to work beyond simple placebo and that the materials used in the products are non-toxic and recyclable.
I won't change your opinion of course but anybody else can see for his/her own self that most of my product pages have a section of research studies citing several medical papers which support the claims made about the products. All are easy to find and read the source to make your own conclusions and if you need more evidence a quick Google Scholar search will give you even more studies to compare with.
Apart from that I try to accompany my products with blog posts that help them improve potential health issues that they have. For example, if I sell a skincare cream pack to improve acne I also write a blog post like [Acne Home Remedies]( about how to find the cause of their acne and what they can do to improve it without buying my products.
Imho the more reliable information I give customers the more able will be to verify it for themselves and see if the products are right for them.

Hi, I made some changes, can you check if it still gives you a 403? Thank you very much for taking some time to help me.
