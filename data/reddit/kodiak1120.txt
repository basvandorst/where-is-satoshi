Generally speaking, mining is profitable right now because of how high the price of bitcoin is and because of network congestion, which is driving the fees up.  Recently, Slush Pool mined a block that had more BTC in fees than the 12.5 BTC block reward.  Most blocks recently have been between 15 and 19 BTC, in my experience.  However, mining hardware is also incredibly expensive.  Thus, the time it would take you to recoup your hardware investment would be substantial.

When you see an address that hasn't spent any coins since literally two days after Bitcoin was invented, suddenly moving coins in September of 2017, it raises a red flag. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:33:17
Hal has been quoted as saying that he became involved around block 70.  
This is block 9.

Yes, September 2017 is recent.  It's not four hops.  It's literally one person removed from Satoshi.  Satoshi sends to 1Q2TWHE3GMdB6BZKafqwxXtWAWgFt5Jvm3 in January of 2009.  Although those coins were shortly thereafter sent to another address, other coins received at that very same address were spent in September of last year.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:41:19
After looking at it, I think you are right.  Although the original transfer was from the address that Block 9 when to, the subsequent transfer happened later, after Hal Finney became involved so this probably is the 10 he sent to Hal.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:43:59
Yes and yes.  A good quality metal stamping set should work fine.  Otherwise, you can use an engraver.

Remember we're talking about 750k BTC... Perhaps 500k or so we're stolen and the 250k still showing as associated with addresses once control by Gox are cold storage coins that he lost the key to. I think that's the most likely scenario. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:14:43

EIL5: How does the network verify that the sender has the correct private key without actually knowing the private key?  I (think I) understood this at one time, but when trying to explain it to someone else, I realized I was confused.  I know it has something to do with the way private keys are generated and hashing functions (I think), but I can't explain it specifically.  Thanks!

Have you ever actually bought something with bitcoins?   What hassle are you referring to?  
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:07:38
Why is everyone saying you can't break even on this?  If you use bitcoinwisdom.com, and input 900 gh/s (for two miners) and a 15% increase, you will mine back your 1.5 BTCs in about three months.   Admittedly, there's not much left after that point in terms of mining capabilities, but it's all profit.  This assumes you start today, which I realize isn't possible but keep in mind you can always sell this thing on eBay and get some of your money back.  The first two miners I bought on eBay before the last bubble I mined with for three months and sold for more than I paid.  I realize that's not all that common of a scenario, but you'll definetely get something back. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 13:00:06
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:50:30
Another thing to consider is that if the price of BTC goes up between now and when you sell, you may sell it for more than it cost you.  I did that when I bought two BFL 30 gh/s units off of eBay for $600 each when BTC was less than $200.  A month or so later, the price was at $1,200 and the miners I bought were selling for more than double what I paid.  I sold them about four months later for the same price I paid for them, and mined about 6 BTCs for free (minus electricty).

The Genesis Block contains an encoded message that reads: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."  That was the headline for an English newspaper on the date indicated.  Most people believe this was done by Satoshi to prove that the Genesis Block was not created before the date of the newspaper.  Some people think this also shows that he is British, since he used a British newspaper.

What I find most unbelievable is that he would so quickly acknowledge that he is the real Satoshi Nakamoto when confronted by the reporter in front of the police.  That statement, "I have nothing to do with that anymore" is the most compelling evidence that this is him, and it's also the most unbelievable.  Why would go to such great lengths to keep himself out of this and then immediately confess to someone who has basically been harassing him.  I find that part very hard to believe.

VPN service was the first thing I ever bought with bitcoin.  I didn't even plan on paying with bitcoin, but when I got to the payment screen I saw the "we accept bitcoin" logo and thought, "sweet!"  I've since bought a wallet, some razor blades and a baby stroller.  Mostly thanks to overstock.com. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:01:08
No sales tax in NJ with overstock.com. Amazon now charges sales tax. Adding in a 7 percent sales tax actually makes it more expensive on Amazon.  Well done.

I did use an old wallet.key backup file... did that screw something up?  
Edit:  by old, I mean I didn't create the wallet.key file from the old computer immediately before importing it to the new computer.  I think the wallet.key file was about a month or two old.  I may have spent some BTC after making the backup file that I imported to my new computer.  If that's the case, that may be what's triggering the warning, but should I be concerned about anything?

This is what I don't understand.  Why would he go to such great lengths to distance himself from it and then immediately confess as soon as asked.  I think the journalist may be taking some liberties what what was said.  If he did say this, I wouldn't be surprised if he was talking about some other topic.

Bucky, 
I may get downvoted to hell for this, but I think a documentary about Mark Karpels and the downfall of Mt. Gox would be more interesting and becuase the story is far from over, you could do it in real time.  There's so many questions that are unanswered and no one has really taken a hard look at this with some money backing to try to come up with answers.  Everything about the prior collapse, the demonstration of solvency, the latest collapse, Karpel's wierd behavior during and after, etc...  it's all very interesting. 
By the way, I'm a lawyer and I'll volunteer my time if you need help on legal-related issues.  I'm not a IP lawyer, so I have no expertese in copyright or trademark matter, but I can review contracts, license, etc.  
PM me if you need help.

Well maybe if you're being a total dick and constantly bragging about how "to the moon" you are, but I don't think most people are like this.  
My brother-in-law stayed with us for a few days this summer and saw my mining equipment in the garage.  That lead to a brief conversation about bitcoin and mining.  
The next time I spoke to him about it was over Thanksgiving, when everyone was talking about it because it was right around the all time high.  I wasn't bragging, but I was defending the technology and trying to get him to understand why there is an intrinsic value in being able to send money to anyone, anywhere essentially for free.  
Those two instances were the only times we discussed it, so it's not like I was constantly bragging about my success.

That helps... thanks. Two questions though...  When the document gets hashed, I'm assuming you need a private key to convert the hashed output back into the document?
Also, how or where on the blockchain does the hashed value go?

Wow thanks for all the comments. To answer a few questions...  it is a Celestron Nextar 127slt. It's a great telescope. It was $457 after a $30 coupon, or 0.7764674 bitcoins. I bought it as a fathers day gift to myself. 
As far as what you can see, I was able to see a very clear view of Saturn last night including the rings. I only had about 20 minutes though before the clouds rolled in. I was actually able to see it through the clouds long age after it was no longer visible with the naked eye. It's pretty damn cool to actually see Saturn in real time with your own eyes. I think I even saw one of its moons, but I didn't have time to confirm. 
I'm told you can easily see the cloud bands on jupiter and at least four of its moons, as well as numerous deep space objects like galaxies, nebula, etc.
I've got a lot of gazing to do.

$457, or about 0.77 bitcoins.

Right, but that still doesn't explain why he couldn't sign a message, which wouldn't violate the trust or cause tax implications. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:02:32
So the article basically concludes that C.W. "couldn't" move the early coins (or sign a message) because either the "trustees" wouldn't agree to it in writing??? or because he was supposedly concerned about being prosecuted as a terrorist, so which is it?  And who the hell are the trustees??   Does it ever mention who they are?   I find it pretty hard to believe that someone as sophisticated as C.W. or S.N. would honestly believe they were going to be prosecuted simply for creating something that is 'sometimes' used by criminals for nefarious purposes.  Did the inventor of the internet get prosecuted because it can be used by terrorist or drug dealers?  Did the guy who invented email have those concerns?  This is all pretty unbelievable from even a non-technical standpoint.

I did too...  I bought a laptop, a telescope, a crib, and a bunch of other shit back in the day.  I spent 2 BTC on a telescope that was about $650 at the time.  Today, those bitcoins would be worth ~$14,000!  I spent waaaayyyyy! more than $30k.  Definitely would not do it again!

If Willy was controlled by someone inside Gox, that could explain their fiat withdraw problem, because Willy would be buying BTC without actually have the fiat to make the trade.  Gox would have basically becomes a ponzi scheme at that point and the fiat would have just gotten shuffled around, but eventually would have had to have collapsed because BTC is being bought, but additional fiat is not coming in.  The dramatic rise in price would have alleviated that problem to some extent, but if Willy was affecting the price, they would have not been able to sell a significant amount of BTC, or the price would have gone down and caused more problems.  
Not sure if that's been discussed.
