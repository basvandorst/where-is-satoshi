You present a very good argument in your first paragraph. My (very little) experience with US law is that penalties can vary wildly and (to me) unpredictably across cases. The risks associated with operating a business and handling monetary transactions frighten me because of this. But considering the number of small businesses in existence, these risks are probably not much larger than the legal risks of everyday life as a citizen or a good Samaritan if I operate my business in good faith.

"smokes crack" could be considered slander, as it could be taken as an insult. Slander is not protected under the freedom of speech. But to my knowledge, the article didn't contain any slander.
Otherwise, I agree with you - fact checking in journalism is important, but there are plenty of useful articles to be written for which there's *no way* to know for sure if the content is true.
For example, if you're interviewing a witness who claims that the U.S. planted the idea of WMDs in Iraq, there's *no way* you can know for certain that he's telling the truth. But you should still be able to publish your article without having to worry about legal action in the case that your witness was unreliable.

Additionally why is OP pushing for "XBT" = 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin? That's precisely 1 "micro-" bitcoin, as *standardized* by SI. OP could push for "uBT" instead of "XBT" - same number of letters and same number of syllables, yet MUCH more clear to people who are new to bitcoin but have backgrounds in science. "uBTC" makes more sense, since the "uBT" could be mistaken as "microbit", and it's only one more letter/syllable.
@_date: 2014-01-21 09:02:54
However, the bitcoin standard was designed such that each bitcoin is divisible into 10^8 pieces, and if we ever need more resolution, it's trivial to increase *that* rather than mint new coins. And since there's no central governing body that needs to maintain a budget, etc, there's really very little reason for purposefully inflating the currency.
Also, I would think that miners would be *for* increasing the 21 million cap, rather than against it. They would be the ones receiving the coins!

The original thread is [here]( mtgox says the password is sent via post over https (which is the widely-accepted norm). Not sure where SmokeTooMuch got his url from (perhaps he misunderstood the data given by a browser tool like Firebug?), but he later (2nd page) suggests to hash the password on the client-side and then send that hash to the server and compare it directly to the hash stored in the database. That is generally considered to be worse than hashing server-side, as the hash function and constants are made public. So I think there's a fair chance this was just an uneducated user bringing undeserved bad reputation upon MtGox.

There are [services]( out there tracking all the various blockchain forks. Although you might not be able to *prove* that a miner is maliciously transmitting double-spends, it looks pretty suspicious when a miner continues to mine on a shorter fork when there's already another fork that's a block or two higher, which is generally required for a double-spend attack on a service that requires one-or-more confirmations.

That's a silly thing to say. If bitcoin hadn't skyrocketed in value, there wouldn't be nearly as many people sitting on stockpiles of coins looking for ways to spend them or people to donate them to.
Also, you've got a market cap to worry about. Not a problem at the moment, but if each bitcoin was worth just 1 penny, it would take significantly longer to trade these donations for actual, spendable money.

Hmm. This was just a login hack, which was fixed. In order for somebody to login as Satoshi after the hack was fixed, they would have either had to determine or change Satoshi's password back when the vulnerability existed. *Typically*, password resets are based on e-mail, and I doubt anyone has access to Satoshi's email. Password changes often require the user to input their current password for verification, which the hackers never gained access to. And I highly doubt there's any way for a logged-in user to view his/her current password, especially since that would require that the passwords be stored unencrypted.
So it's not *totally* far-fetched - maybe the hack *also* allowed hackers to change a user's password without authentication, or maybe Ning doesn't require users to verify their credentials before changing them (I've never used the service). Or perhaps somebody knows of a similar hack that they've been keeping private. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:33:32
Tru dat. But including more transactions also effects the propagation rate of a new block. A 100 kb block will be accepted by the network more quickly than a 10 mb block, meaning that by incorporating more transactions into the block, you risk allowing a competing block to gain majority-acceptance before yours (ie your block gets orphaned). This will play a factor in the true transaction cost until world-wide network speeds improve significantly, which seems to be taking quite some time.

Coinbase is not an exchange. They can justify adding the 30-50 basis point margins because the exchange rate is volatile and that protects them if it changes radically between when they quote you a price and when you confirm the purchase &amp; they place the order. This type of fee doesn't exist on exchanges.
If you trade on an exchange you'll typically pay 0-0.2% fee for each transaction. Some exchanges might charge you for withdrawals and deposits as well, but the better ones only charge the amount to cover the underlying bitcoin transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:46:33
I didn't want the 2% (effective) fee of buying through coinbase - I used ACH to deposit funds into GDAX &amp; will be gradually exchanging it for BTC at much lower fees (once it clears). Usually that would have been a smarter move financially - not so clear now - but in the long term it should still play out similarly &amp; even if I get less coin, I'm still helping to push cryptocurrencies forward.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:29:43
Mind you that even after the anal probing, Kraken only appears to accept bank _wires_ (for which my bank charges $35). Gemini appears to support depositing funds directly from a bank account, but it's limited to only some banks (not mine).
GDAX/Coinbase are the only place I've found so far that will actually allow for depositing funds without a fee (in this case, via ACH). Coinbase's USD&lt;-&gt;BTC transaction is effectively fee'd at 2% (they exchange at the GDAX exchange rate +/- a 0.5% margin, and then charge an explicit 1.5% fee on top of that), whereas GDAX fees never exceed 0.2% of the transaction. Among those, the choice seems fairly obvious.
That being said, I'd love to know of any other exchanges that allow for depositing US funds w/o fees. CEX.io looked promising, but they don't accept users from my state.
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:38:38

\ as a tag line is great. It gives one the opportunity to advertise the fact that Bitcoin is a _trustless_ system (in some senses). When you deal in Bitcoin\*, you don't have to worry about forged bills, or about bills that are otherwise tied to illegal activities, nor do you have to worry that a government will rapidly print more of the stuff, etc.
So, _why trust paper_? Bitcoin gives you the same, but with less trust!
Only... then you go on to apparently advertise the price change _of bitcoin_. Because the change in conversion rates there is due to growth in Bitcoin - not loss in the Euro. That 50 Euro bill still has about the same value over that time period. I don't know, I really like the idea of selling Bitcoin on its _principles_, and it seems you steered a bit off course at the end there. Just my thoughts.

Do you feel that this somehow strengthens your argument? Now 100% of the transaction cost is the fee itself! That's absurd!
Taken as a proportion of the transaction value, bitcoin fees are relatively low for high-value transactions and relatively high for low-value transactions. So "why the shit are people still complaining about fees": it's because those people want to use bitcoin for low-value transactions.

I'm curious how many bitcoin enthusiasts avoid credit cards. I assumed there would be some notable overlap between the group of people who see cash as superior to credit cards (cards leak private info about purchasing habits to third parties and their security model has largely been poor) and the group of people who see cryptocurrencies as technologically superior (as they have a solid security model and the _ability_ to leak less information).
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:00:53


I understand percentages. You say it costs you $1 to move $650. Since Bitcoin fees aren't dependent on the value of a transaction, it would cost $1 to move _any_ amount of bitcoin. Therefore, it cost $1 _in fees_ to purchase your cup of coffee.  So if the coffee "might end up being $1 including fees", and the fee is $1, then the coffee would have to be $0. So... _100% of the transaction cost is the fee_ - is it not?

What makes 1 MB the sweet spot, though? Why not 100 KB? 10 KB? Yes, _of course_ the block size can't be increased indefinitely to keep up with demand. Additional scaling improvements are needed. But if we're in a situation where increasing the block size by 1 MB loses just 1% of the full nodes ... don't the pros outweight the cons? Wouldn't that increase in throughput attract more users and those new users would run full nodes, potentially _increasing_ the number of nodes at work? _Where_, precisely is the point at which increasing the blocksize becomes a bad thing to do? And has that point really not changed _at all_ over the past 3 years as technology continues to improve?
I'm sure someone's done research on this. Somebody else in this sub linked a paper claiming 4 MB (at publication date, 8 MB today) was the point at which blocksize increases cause a measurable loss in the number of active nodes, but I haven't read it. I'm more curious about research _that supports the current status quo_, since everyone here seems to believe that 1 MB is somehow intrinsically the right choice for where we are today.

GDAX fees are strictly a proportion of the trade amount, and applied only to the taker. Withdrawals are free and GDAX covers the transaction fee. However, they usually only allow a minimum order amount of 0.01 BTC because of this... so I'm not sure how this 0.0000229 trade is possible.

As long as you're connected to at least _one_ trustworthy node, then it takes a 51% POW attack to fool you specifically, assuming you don't trust transactions until after a few confirmations. Otherwise, that one trustworthy node would present you with a longer chain and your SPV client would ignore the malicious nodes.
But yes - if you were manipulated into connecting to only malicious nodes, then they could fool you. As hinted by your link, this isn't necessarily difficult to do. At this point, a miner could trick you into accepting a double-spend, or make you think that a transaction hadn't made its was into a block yet. *But they can never directly steal your funds*.
I am _not_ trying to say that everyone should just use SPV! I only want to address this comment:


because SPV is a completely _different_ set of trust issues than banking. When you do banking, you're wide open to having your funds directly stolen from you by a class of actors, without any initiative on your part. This isn't true with SPV! The only way you can have funds stolen from you with SPV is if you specifically release them, and the security risk is that someone presents you with a false view of the ledger that leads you to _decide_ to do this (e.g. you're lead to believe that your transaction was rejected by the network, so you redo the transaction and stupidly decide to use a different set of coins than you did the first time around).

Monero difficulty is around 30,000,000,000. Block reward is about 6.5 XMR. Price is about $95USD per XMR. My laptop (2-core i5) gets about 20 hashes/second. The income per second is roughly `20/30,000,000,000 * 6.5 * 95 = 4.12e-7 $/sec`. That's about 3.6 cents per day, of which Coinhive takes 30% leaving you with 2.5 cents.

And it also makes it very difficult to make large, backwards incompatible changes. Things like SegWit take years, whereas if there weren't so many people with a huge stake in the _price_ of bitcoin, transaction malleability could have been resolved in a few months with a much cleaner (but client-breaking) implementation.
These kind of stakeholders also encourage the tech to evolve in a way that maximizes their short-term value, as opposed to evolving to be technically superior. This is demonstrated by all the allegations seen about various Bitcoin developers being controlled by for-profit companies.
On the other hand, ethereum and its friends have shown that there's room here for more than one cryptocurrency. So even if the Bitcoin protocol is largely set in stone, cryptocurrencies as a whole are still evolving rapidly enough.

That's not even what makes the sync slow though, is it? I thought it was primarily the actual validation of the blocks.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:22:19
It's not the same trust issues though, is it? Although you can't verify that the transaction inputs are valid, Simplified Payment Verification does allow you to verify that a transaction was included in a block and that the POW was met.
A miner _could_ invest the work to fool SPV users, but their block would not be propagated through the network, as it would contain invalid transactions. This effectively costs the miner $50,000+ that they could have claimed from the mining reward. They can only fool SPV clients directly connected to them, and clients like Electrum connect to multiple hosts which would require the hosts to collude in order to fool you. It's not as foolproof as running a full node, but it probably requires less trust than banking!

People here are claiming 1.49% fee, but [this]( help page makes it sound like the effective fee may be closer to 2%, in that the price they quote you can be +/-0.5% the exchange rate. I'm guessing this is to protect themselves against volatility (there is some delay between when they quote you and when they can complete the exchange) and limited market depth (like when your purchase can't be completely filled by the top sell order).
But coinbase doesn't elaborate on the 0.5% margin - can anyone confirm this is how it works?

I'm excited for all the improvements that are planned for the reference client to reduce disk space and network bandwidth (and speed up initial blockchain download).

Not that it really impacts me, but if an ad plays by your rules, then why do you deny that content? That seems arbitrary and inconsistent.

Well, keep in mind you're talking about the number of merchants **listed on coinmap**, not *all* bitcoin merchants. It could be a doubling in bitcoin merchants... Or it could just be that coinmap is becoming more well-known and the already-existing merchants are listing their businesses as they learn about it. Most likely, it's a combination of the two.

I think this just got downvoted because it comes off as being rude (mostly to the OP). It seems to describe r/bitcoin pretty accurately though - lots of posts with very little meaningful content, or worse, "checkmate-atheists" arguments :/

bit-ads looks pretty nice, though the ads consistently take between 5 and 20 seconds to load. And I can't tell if it tracks every impression or just unique viewers. And it doesn't appear to have much advertiser-interest at this point, sadly.

For those of us who aren't economists, an ETF is an [Exchange Traded Fund]( It's still mostly gibberish to me, but it sounds like ETFs tend to create more variability in price throughout the day.
