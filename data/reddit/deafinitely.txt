I've always wondered why the difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks. Bitcoin being a digital, programmable system, why can't the difficult be more dynamic? Say, every block?

Gotcha. Makes sense, thanks!

Seems eerily familiar...
Embrace, Enhance, Extinguish.
All large corporations in the 21rst century are shit and in bed with the government. Who really thought that just because google proclaims to not be evil, that they are not evil? All large corporations must lie and cheat their way to the top in the current political environments to succeed.
The only real way to go nowadays is completely open source, complete end-to-end encryption, or not at all.

A "retro" game that has stunning graphics which obviously requires the use of iOS 8.
Same here, have iPhone 4 &amp; iOS 7, no intention of upgrading unless phone is stolen or dies.
Would love to try the game out...

What about when the power goes out? Or the internet kill-switch is activated?

I had also thought of the analogy to being unable to retrieve cash from an ATM without electricity.
My concern here is with the transfer of bitcoins from one party to another without electricity. Even if a paper wallet is used in trade, don't you need electricity to verify the contents of the paper wallet and/or for the network for "verify" that the transaction took place? Am I missing something here? I am assuming, based on what I currently know, that in order for a transaction to be valid and appear in the blockchain, it has to be mined, involving electricity.

I can walk into a branch and ask for cash?

I thought bitcoin was supposed to be free of political bias?

It seems clear to me the reasons for this.
Like any "professional" investors these days, they know quite well what they are doing here: Making a deal with the devil in exchange for vastly lower risk of return on their money. They don't want to go thru the hassle of actually competing in the marketplace for a return, so they turn to the government to provide a solid ROI. Governments would provide a solid cash flow to have something like this. This is how nearly all "professional" investors work these days.
Thus, the need for a 100% securely untraceable crypto-currency.

Very good points on 1 and 2. I agree fully with point 
On point  however, I disagree. I think it would actually be a huge concern, because now I have wealth that I cannot transfer to another party to get emergency supplies, etc.
If the power goes out for an extended period, and I was smart enough to have an emergency cash fund onhand always, then I would not be totally hanging - at least I could still trade for the bare essential goods (clean water, food, etc). How can I do that with bitcoin with no power?

Thank you for explaining this.
That is a lot of swearing to go thru, in my opinion.

This is a serious flaw in the design of bitcoin. Eventually, some massive entity will control 51% of the network. Why not create a new protocol that requires everyone using the network to help verify the network? In this way, it is guaranteed that no one entity will control 51% of the network. For example, in order to spend a coin, I first have to verify for myself that the previous block was correct and pass that on to other nodes, or something like this.

Yes, I am intending to mean with zero electricity, such as some natural disaster or something that knocks off all electricity in a given area.
I suppose it would be similar to what happens when portions of the internet go down, you just can't get online at that moment, but eventually it goes go back up and then you get back online and do your merry business.
Could you explain more about the paper wallet concept? Because from what I understand so far about bitcoin, in order for a transaction to "take place" and be "valid", it has to be approved by the network, which requires both electricity and internet.
He made the point that, in comparison, gold and even cash doesn't suffer from this problem: if the electricity goes out, they can still be transferred from one party to another.
This is a "worst case" question, but nevertheless I believe a very good question to ponder, because we are starting to see entire countries go offline these days. We should plan for eventualities like that.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:32:32
I agree - not a lot of other banking options that rely on electricity (and we use way more often than cash these days) would be working either. However, these are merely conveniences for a way to transfer paper dollars. USD has both an "online" and "offline" mode, if you will. Bitcoin does not have an analogous "offline" mode, correct?
So I guess the answer is to have wealth stored in a tangible asset (such as gold, silver, even cash) as well as an intangible asset such as bitcoin?
