You'd be lucky to find 1 in 50 that can tell you what gives the dollar value or how the dollar is created

I'd be willing to bet that before that happens. People will literally be mining for bitcoin in old land fills.

Bitcoin is like a tulip, you never know what you're going to get.

Correct. If everyone got out of gold at the same time it would crash in value. And likely if you bought in high you would have take a lose or hope it rebounded. If the sell orders out weigh the buy orders it would be very hard to get out.

Nope. But gold also has industrial uses. So at some point the cost of mining gold would level the price. Supply and demand.

By all means fill me in. But well your doing that reread what I wrote. The way in which people are talking about this is going to get a lot of them roasted. I've read in several spots someone stating that BTC is going to the moon, because market cap is $Xbillion.

Correct, but market depth is very low right now, orders between 10 - 50 swing the price drastically.

There is a lot of liquidity in BTC right now. But the depth is still low. The order book proves it. Depth is defined by how much a single trade can swing the price in a given asset.

I think bitcoin is going to change the way the world exchanges value. I was simply point out something I've observed or the past few weeks.

You should always hedge your bets when possible. Going all in, usually ends up in losing it all.

I don't have to guess. History is full of examples. What I'm getting at is much like the Dollar, Bitcoin is only worth what you can sell it for. Saying that Bitcoin market is worth more than JPmorgan is only correct if you can sell all the bitcoins for more than JPmorgan could be sold for.

And all the life boats have left. ��

Actually it could. But you’d have to convince enough people. So you could have them use the power of nullification
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:20:17
Wouldn’t surprise me. They don’t want people to know how much power they really have.

Well I’m sure some are getting rekted. Bitcoin has to clear a lot of resistance before this can be declared the end of the bear market.
