there is already 1btc on mainnet LN, but you're right about the learning experience... these bitcoins can be concidered as a hacker bounty program

the lightning is still untested. If all those nodes get hacked somehow - this would be a very bad publicity
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:49:03
I hope you'll get verified. I'm using Bitstamp since 2013. Used credit card, SEPA transfers, done a withdrawals several times. So far - no problems at all. AND support is actually replying your questions! :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:30:38
You'll find plenty complains on Coinbase on reddit...

When I was worried about BCH flippering a couple of months ago - my old BFL was running 7 days in a row. I have mined 0.00003141 BTC on Slush pool... someday, when BTC 1M - i will get those pesky 31$ out of the pool :)

JUST DON"T USE COINBASE! They do not owe you anything! Not implementing SegWit is better for their business. Just use another exchange.
Someday other cheaper exchanges will push them out of business. But right now - there's nothing we can do.

It's just a good joke buy the way. Check the guys twitter. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:41:59
Never use Coinbase. I'm in europe and using Bitstamp sinse 2013
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:33:11
Bitstamp is quickest and easiest of them all. Using it sinse 2013. Though I wish they wouldn't allow me to sell BTC :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:31:09
I'm not good in all the market stuff but I always thought - if one goes down, there's other that goes up. Or the most trading is still done with fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:03:03
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:21:27
Bitcoin Cash was very successful in that, Bitcoin Gold - a little less... I'm sure that every next copycat fork will be less and less valued.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:42:10
And if it true, and there is no hidden fees - there is another even bigger question - why anyone (at least in Europe) is still using Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:23:36
I remember buying bitcoins for 8$ and selling for 12$... Felt the same!
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:25:19
but begging btc for this is still inappropriate
@_date: 2018-09-15 12:34:31
Because these guys just want to make money. They don't care about crypto in general.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:41:29
i never posted anything to him, so it looks suspicious..
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:32:55
but why are you giving 1btc away just like that?
@_date: 2018-08-07 16:04:00
I think i've got around 40$ for 6 months I'm registered there.
ps. The link is referral. Use it at your own will, but if your registration is successful - we're both getting an extra 1$ in BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:54:21
no shit!!!
@_date: 2018-08-07 15:59:46
You have to register, have LinkedIn account etc.. the process is quite complicated, but at the end - you will receive 1$ in BTC for answering some questions sent by 'new super token' creators. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:41:54
Bitstamp is thr best for Europe imo. But you have to pass KYC first.
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:57:49
If this is true - i can't hate this japanese attorney guy more. Why sell now? Why just not return in BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-31 11:03:36
Please, don't be fooled. Russia allowing crypto is BAD. The only reason crypto is sort of legal in russia - is to give goverment one more way to legalize stolen money. Now each politician can say - I made these millions with crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:10:33
You're right. It's rather a good thing that one celebrity can not affect price just by random tweet. It was different a year ago. Progress!
@_date: 2018-10-06 07:35:34
In LightningNetworkStores you can up-vote your store by paying some extra satoshis. Doesn't look fair to me.
Is there any Lightning merchant services rating based on some technical data? Transaction count... channel activity? Is it possible at all in LN?
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:03:33
I don't care about down-up-votes. My question is serious, I didn't read their books so I decided to ask the community.
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:53:05
Thanks for the calm honest answer. That's what I was looking for.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:53:37
**R.I.P github!**
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:42:24
Correct me if i'm wrong. If mempool is overloaded and people pay XXL fees to make a transfer, shouldn't those fees compesate the less profitability? I read a post on that one of the last blocks had total sum of fees higher than the block reward...
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:01:38
well my english is not perfect, sorry for that
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:02:05
and the bad news is that all this bullshit... deriatives, features are coming to bitcoin aswell... that's what worries me most
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:42:24
Same shit in Estonia. SEB and SWEDBANK.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:18:59
The price is relative. BCH is only several months old.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:40:10
Wow, that would be even more fun if SegWit2X would still be pushed thru...
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:10:18
I really love BTC and core's vision but lets face it - **at the moment** BCH is better currency - tiny fees, quicker transactions. Yes, segwit fixes some problems, yes, on-chain scaling is tricky and can cause problems in the future. But when is this future? When BCH wlll face first block size problems? Bitcoin newcomers don't think about it... they don't even know about it. 
I hope to be wrong, but I think that BCH pump is just started. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:09
I wonder what will do all those people who finally get their bitcoins transferred? Still sell those?
 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:35:13
The confirmations take a long time. Can I use my old BFL miner to speed things up? It's useless for BTC anyways :)
Is there any information how can I mine on lightning testnet? Or the mining difficulty is the same as BTC, so my miner is useless here aswell?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:52:32
I still think that slush is a Hero. I saw a light in the dark S2X tonnel after his statement. I also plugged my useless old 50Ghs miner, and mined thru Slush pool last 3 days :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:10:38
Cool, I hope this means XAPO will soon adopt segwit!
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:20:52
Just buy regularly the same amount and you're protected against buying at ATH. I think it's called time average. My perfect is not english :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:23:17
Don't worry - people will just use the ones that have upgraded and are cheaper to use.

I'm afraid i will never react to "New York" as a normal person...
@_date: 2019-02-17 14:57:44
He tried to launder his Bitcoins! I don't think he will ask legal system for help :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:06:25
My 60Gh/s Butterfly Labs miner is prepared for the S2X hardfork (my Bitcoin Core full node aswell). Not sure if it helps, but definitely won't do any harm.
I also think that at this point it's too early to let Bitcoin protect itself, we have to help.  Looking at the market cap - bitcoin is still a small turtle trying to find its place in the ocean full of financial sharks :)
@_date: 2019-04-26 10:13:30
 The "pump" started at the price HIGHER as the dump price. That doesn't make sense!
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:47:42
Yes! Yesterday I got 0.6sat/b TX confirmed. Waited 10 hours.

Why this idiot is even dealing with stuff ne has no idea about... I wish he regret it forever.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:22:33
Sorry, my english is not perfect. The bitcoins of MTGOX should be returned back to creditors. Instead of giving them back as is, they are being sold for fiat. Causing bitcoin price to crash as a result. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:03:27
It's not about being poor. It's about being greedy :) Posting it here not for the discussion but hoping more people will buy the article. Good luck with that!
@_date: 2019-01-05 12:27:35
Can anyone tell how much was it? Don't want to pay for the article :)
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:09:50
I am still unable to verify my account to BE ABLE to withdraw. Support is ignoring me. Have you been able to actually get those bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:45:20
I am not professional trader, but the way he sold these bitcoins is wrong.
And second - why did he sold them at all? Just give it back proportionally. 
I lost only 1,5btc, but there are people who lost thousands. And this guy destroys the price by the bitcoins that belong to these people.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:50:16
Well the mining price is about 6k, so theoretically it shouldn't go much lower than that.
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:23:27
and still almost no real world usage of bitcoin

Lightning plugin for wordpress is anounces yesterday.

Watching this thread. Been thinking about untouched 1-2 sat/b transactions. However my yesterday's 1,6 sat/b transacrion was cleared in couple hours.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:19:23
You sold at profit so not stupid. Not wize perhaps :)
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:26:38
What is really weird that 1-2 sat/b transactions are not cleared! mempool is geetting cleared for higher fee transactions but as soon it gets to 1-2 sat - the clearing stops... Why is that? 1-2 sat is still better than nothing. Am i wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:34:33
Definitely not Banksy! Good work though.
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:55:32
OP may have no prooves, but admit it - you're so angry because you're afraid he might be right. Still you have no right to be so rude. Just ignore.
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:02:39
I don't get it. How tether fail will crash Bitcoin? How this is even connected? If everyone will try to get out of tether - they will buy all other assets. No?

Doing this single operation is very complicated on every router i have seen... you have to do it at least twice... add a forwarding... then save... then something like "apply"... then restart the router and check again :) 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:13:19
I really want to be wrong but I'm pretty sure we will be sub 10k for the whole year. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:38:08
If you truly believe in crypto then valuate your funds in Bitcoins and not in fiat money. Then the price fluctuations do not matter anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-08 02:50:31
Everyone knows that. But you can't dip USD.  Unfortunately OP might be right.
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:00:01
I can't explain it but I still kinda like Dogecoin. Maybe because Doge is a true fork, one of the first ones. Not pretending to be a Bitcoin. I hope there will be a real usecase for it someday.
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:20:56
what the hell is 0.16.99??
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:45:24
Yes, the amount of bitcoins i have is the number I'm looking at. I'm trying to make it grow.  So the next bitcoin dip - is just another oportunity to get more btc for the same price.
