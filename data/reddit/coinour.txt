It is not anti encription, the title is misleading. It is not against encription, just that decripted data must be presented whenever the court order arrives.

So ignorant opinions! If they keep doing what has been doing, they will lose at the end.

@_date: 2016-03-17 14:58:55
3% fees is a bit expensive. If it was me, I would directly send btc to exchanges for fiat money before the purchases.Your bitcoin  Debt probably is for lazy ppl.
@_date: 2016-03-06 03:26:28
We will fall into a dilemma that the fees are two high for the ordinary senders.
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:18:37


where did you get this data
@_date: 2016-03-15 12:40:01
Need script to integrate with the merchants, like automatically creating new deposits address for every orders, grab the real time exchange rate ,monitor the payment status, or check the confirmation times etc. It needs a lot of codes to fulfill these functions.
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:26:13
You ideas are just imagination at the moment. Even we cannot settle the blocksize increase debate. Any decision should be based on some sort of tradeoffs. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:36:49
He is advocating bitcoin classic, accusing the inactive core dev.
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:53:25


yes, miners get more reward but the bitcoin senders are suffering.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:12:30
Absolutely! It is a great opportunity to buy up Bitcoin when the rumors come out to drive down it.
@_date: 2016-03-11 00:17:46
try bitgo, which offer 0 confirnation transactions and guarantee the security of the money.
@_date: 2016-03-17 01:51:59
It supplements the imperfections of Bitcoin and build up its ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-03-16 12:57:15
Written an article for your previous blog update! Really like your service! 
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:28:56
I am confused. Inflation is negative, so it should be falling into deflation. The price should be cheaper. How could the money purchasing power lesser in each year?
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:05:34
It is happening from time to time. But the dumb just feel lucky they are not the victims. Probably they are next.
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:18:17
You could use blockchain.info API to create new address and track them easily! For Wordpress, there is one plugin for it!
@_date: 2016-01-14 01:34:03
Never trust PayPal or Coinbase
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:12:12
It will kill their businesses! They many need to find another solution, like checking ID!
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:03:25
support bitcoin core.
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:57:07
why is it a loss?
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:40:22
But with the crowding network, potential scammers could set low tx fees and wait the mempool drop its tx. 
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:33:36


The data is from 2014 but the data may be fit to the current situation.
@_date: 2016-03-16 15:30:26
It benefits the Bitcoiners and bridge the gap between Bitcoin holders and accepting fiat only traditional businesses. The payment is quick! We could say we are safe.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:24:18
No one wants endless debate which will cause Bitcoin's price highly fluctuate. But  the fact is that we are falling at this hole! 
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:11:10
Once You got caught! No customer will come back!

The power could be corrupted, and refuse the changes to be taken.
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:10:28


Time wasting if they rush to go for job or somethings emergent.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:06:11
You are right! They admit the advantages of  crypto currency, are actively exploring its technology with other financial institutions and developing their own versions! 
@_date: 2016-01-09 01:20:49
Great! Bitcoin intends to play the role of safe haven, as gold!
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:02:33
now the block spam is over. The btc transaction included standard fees will get confirmed quickly. Why will they drop it?
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:19:15
But we can keep improving it to cater our needs and resolve the current issues, until it takes over fiat!
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:28:21
But it runs in a decentralized ways! No single one ppl is responsible for the network!
@_date: 2016-01-24 03:12:01
Have a look at Haobtc team, you will known that! Chinese miners are deploying the Asia machines in the deep forest areas of China!
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:37:09


wait for 1 confirmation you are still safe although the waiting time is insanely going up. Some merchants are aborting btc payments at the meantime. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 15:09:07
great features. I could imagine when it s the periods of congestion, the dynamic fees may end up 4x more during high traffic. The fee market will arise.
@_date: 2016-01-30 15:41:50
For the mass they would never understand the code. What they need is the secure and useful  tools  as bitcoin serves! Bitcoin needs to be applicable in our real economic situation and and cater the personal behavior and habitual requirements. So it related in many aspects of our life. So every minor changes have a lot of consideration. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:24:40
Using  or blockchain based exchanges like OpenLedger
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:35:57
If like that, Bitcoin is dying. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:27:20
Yes, China has its own Bitcoin community and forum called 8btc.com
@_date: 2016-03-04 01:57:46
Check here  , the tx whose fees under 70 satoshi / byte are getting stuck. 
@_date: 2016-03-10 23:09:12
many countries' govs and institutions
@_date: 2016-01-30 14:58:27
Actually you can claim free satoshi from faucets. Just check here :
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:56:04
Just need to averagely spread the nodes in each areas of the world
@_date: 2016-01-24 09:06:07
Like IPhone, turn it back and see the lable! 
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:24:58
Yes, it is our expectations for our best interest. But it may be abused by scammers, who try to reverse the tx and get the output changed to his own. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:18:02
Number 1 has some extent risks if the relaying fees are too low and get dropped by the memory pool, even though the transactions are none RBF
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:15:39
saving un conf trana means nothing even being rebroadcasted later due to opt in fees. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:12:07
what do you mean "waste"? I assume the meaning that the halving will get many unprofitable miners leaving the industry and make the difficulty drop! Yes, it could be like that, but miners are competing for the profit. If there is a margin, they will pick up,mining again.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:11:22
The memety pool only accepts limited number of tx now! The one paying low fees will get dropped by it! It will create fee markets and tx are competing for fees!
@_date: 2016-02-26 12:11:10
Bitcoin is recognized as commodity in US! 
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:54:13
Core 0.12 will wipe out the low fees tx!
@_date: 2016-02-03 01:24:41
please do further investiation before giving out objective conclusion. no data Actually the yuan's value is increase against dollar. lacking sufficient data to support his views. over the several months. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:41:23
Hopefully Bitcoin's price movements are drived by fundamental factors rather than speculative behaviors, like other financial instruments.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:13:51
Yes, it means transactions get confirmed.
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:39:46
Actually some services are showing up to counter this issues like cointape.com, 21.co etc by analyzing previous blocks and estimating reasonable fees.
@_date: 2016-02-06 00:59:05
Never saw that kind of statement yet! Since ppl know how to  mix their coins before sending to exchanges or paying to someone.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:50:45
how could you? Are you joking?
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:49:27
Just analogy! I could assume  you haven't  got the meaning of "bus" as well. 
@_date: 2016-02-09 13:40:03
It just listed a few known facts! I think nothing is special.
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:24:57
Actually they could convert their yuan to btc and transfer to other countries.
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:13:33
Don't throw away unproven and baseless accusations ? So what is the point of keeping you viewing /Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-07 18:46:55
Luckily the list is not much and doesn't exceed the solvency of loanbase ! We can not be luck all the time!
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:57:11
I think it will reduce the burden of miners' CPU.
@_date: 2016-02-07 19:14:29
Like asking ppl why are they using PayPal! Ignorant question! 
@_date: 2016-02-07 18:55:39
If you are buying something with PayPal , it is fine. I have to say PayPal is still the most popular payment method. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:07:05
not actually !The core dev has their own reasons to do it!
