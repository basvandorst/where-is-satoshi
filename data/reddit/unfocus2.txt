Hi all, 
This project is in the intersection of Star Trek fandom and Crypto-currency  (Bitcoin, and the like). We understand that this intersection is probably not very large now, but for those who are interested in both, we better use Star Trek based coins instead of something else! 
Don't you want your own Gold Pressed Latinum (GPL)? or Klingon Empire Darsek(KED)? or United Federation Credits(UFC)?
To promote the use of crypto in StarTrek community, we would like to give away 20 free UFC for anyone who would like to get them. Here is how (step-by-step for newbies):
1. Coins are held on an electronic wallet, each wallet has a distinct address. You need to have a unique address to receive the coin.
2. The easiest way to get an address is just to create an account at Scifi-ex.com, which is an exchange site (think of it as a money market platform). Once you create an account, you click on UFC Deposit button on your profile page, and it should have your personalized address.
3. If you want your own wallet on your desktop, you can download them at: 
4. Post your address here, and we will deposit 20 UFC to it. This is equivalent to cash. It may not worth much right now, but it's still of some value, and it will increase in value as it gets more adoption.

That's true, human abolish money per the lore, however the Federation consists of many planets, and the United Federation of Credits was (will be??) created for convenience while dealing with Federation affairs.
Also, money was still largely used by other civilizations, including Darsek by the Klingon, and Gold Pressed Latinum by the Ferengi.
In fact there are many currencies mentioned in Star Trek lore:
