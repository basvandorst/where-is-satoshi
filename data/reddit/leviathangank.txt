flip a coin :) really with 500 pound i'd give it a week, monday/tuesday will tell if in the short term its going up or not.
I had hoped 1400 would be the new low so bought one at 1550.  Its good to talk about potentials, I was on holiday with the +2200 high.. fucking mates stag do cost me more then id thought :D still keeping faith, i think a year or so it could be +4000.
Russia are gonna adopt it i think to shit on the yanks.. although with trump as his new bum buddy its not certain

if your happy to sit on it for a while.  You might see it fluctuate over the time but its better if your only acutely aware of it-  otherwise watching prices will give you a break down.
maybe give it a week, but you might miss out on a free 50 quid.  In 6 months it wont matter.

I agree, its far to easy to manipulate bitcoins atm.. eventually it will need regulating somehow.

if you need the cash sell, otherwise enjoy the ride.. the prices will go up again once russia pin it- say a month or so from now *fingers crossed*  then sell the fucking lot because america's gonna be crying.  Bye bye dollar standard
