HP XW4600
ECC EASY straight from one of the leading global manufacturers.
So again, how is that hard to obtain?
I went that route because it was cheap, as cheap as building any other "satisfactory" machine to give me 8 cores at the time.
I've read his posts about PHP, maybe he did do that on production, but don't make the mistake of assuming EVERY server is on the public domain.

My point is you are making a big assumption. We have no idea what hardware they purchase, and my point is that for at least 6 years machines have been easily available with ECC memory.
And you can have OFFLINE servers, a segregated network that has no public internet access. That's still "cold" isn't it?
And my point again is that you could both have servers offline, as far as the internet is concerned, or simple workstations (available for longer than GOX has been Bitcoin) that have ECC.
It's a big assumption to say, without inside knowledge, that the machines used to for cold storage *WEREN'T ECC*. That's my point.

A better, safer and more secure option than Mac OS X( &lt;10.9.2)/IOS 6.0-6.1.5 &amp; 7.0-7.0.5.
Please, be glad Apple banned bitcoin, at least now they can't lose you're coin through their massive SSL leak/failure. 
Linux "geeks" have been warning you about security FOR YEARS which is pretty relevant in this case since this bug took from September *2012* until *yesterday* to be patched.
Not to mention how bat shit simple it is to start with Linux with *zero* commitment, like *liveusb*

*PERSONAL* as in *not a business* account. My choices to do what I want with my money are my own, and the bank can do what they want with it, UNLESS I WITHDRAW it, which is within my right, to claim ownership of those funds.

And your method isn't how *FAITH* works. Educate.

"Invented" may be an overstatement. "Strongly Influenced" is no stretch at all though:

You have fun with that "cash", because big brother has so got the little guy's back.
And if you researched what's out there, how these things are done, and did a little work with that wasting computer hardware on your desk, which is clearly 20 years more advanced than you'll ever be comfortable with, it wouldn't be "overpriced" to you.

The fact that you have to resort to throwing insults in general is not a strong point for your case. It makes you look uneducated, if not utterly unintelligible. Maybe you should give your keyboard, and your poor tired little fingers that can't spare the effort to type anymore, a break. Unplug, have another bowl, and turn on some damn cartoons.

That's where I have to say you are sounding more brainwashed than any. It is no ones duty unto anyone to educate any other. We do it out of kindness, and courtesy. But it is NOT your duty to force your view, or insult any other who rationally, and open-mindedly, thinks differently than you.
Such was the reason the pilgrims colonized on the North American continent. To escape persecution of those who saw differently. It is the American spirit, such as when it wages war against tyranny, that we should all be free to believe what we choose.
And I believe what I choose, not what any "religion" taught me.

My thoughts are "This is my *personal* account, all of my financial activity is well within the law, and well within my rights to spend as I see fit. Unless you want to engage in legal proceedings for harassment and violation of my banking privacy, I suggest you *NEVER* inquire why I make my decisions again. Do you know what is printed on the dollar? In GOD we trust, not *in banks*, so if I see foot to split my assets within the limit of the law, please refrain from this harassment, or I will find another bank whom will be willing to hold the portion of my assets I lend to then without question. Good day."

*OR* he's a fat fucking liar and you are giving him tools to work with and achieve successful theft of ~$400M.

OP, explain your logic: *and it would be unwise to make the cold wallet address on one of his servers.*
And mid range workstations use ECC RAM. Hell, I built one at home for &lt;$400 ( dual Xeon quad w/ 12gb ECC DDR2)

You are free to think whatever you want about faith, but unless you are an English scholar who is literally paid to write dictionaries, I recommend you stop proclaiming your idiocy publicly.

Differ or not, it does not change *THE FACT* that these are not you duties. And you can spout all the *proof* you have, but I'll let you in on a secret: You can prove how everything in the universe has happened mathematically, physically. But you cannot prove WHY any of it has happened. When you embrace that you will never know this, you can start to grow up and worry about others.
Also, please refrain from your bull crap *indoctrination* this and that. I may have been offered a state education, but it, and the government, will never limit my horizons. My school didn't offer shit for computer science, I still learned more than most of the CS teachers had to offer.

Ok, you want an education? Do it the adult way. This is the internet. I was neither built BY or FOR fucking children. If you want someone to educate you, pay for it chump. Otherwise, shut your hole, and go learn about this the way every ELSE did.

Mark, you felonious, obese fucking twerp: Every currency exchange you don't have the funds to back up is a crime.
Also, change your damn screen name, it's insulting to the entire linux community to have it's icon in any way associated to you "magicaltux", magically committing FRAUD!
