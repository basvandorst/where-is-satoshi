He isn't helping destroy he's helping make their lives safer. Understand that as long as people are people, people will want and do drugs regardless on their legality. Silk road provides a "safer" way to do that. I am not thick i get what you mean though but if you step back it really is safer this way for the users.

Your logic is flawed in a bunch of places. You're not made poorer your prevented from getting richer using mining (which was never its intent to begin with). You realize the tenants of why crypto currency is good has NOTHING To do with income equality. It has to do with freedom and your bit about how its "not fair now" isn't going to play well here since it is some "socialist bullshit". I don't think he had to be so rude about it but he's dead on. You're just upset you can't summon money from the ether in a profitable way, well join the club, doesn't mean that the system is broken only that you lacked an understanding of its true purpose.

Organized crime is a political problem based on a government trying to control individuals and how the want to lead their lives. With drugs for instance you are not helping anyone making them illegal. All that happens is a shady organized crime element moves in, black market is created, the substances become more dangerous less controlled, and non violent people end up in jail.
This "software bug" has the potential to minimize some of that but your right it's not a solution, ending prohibition is the only solution that will 100% work.

Why send them currency that they are going to need to convert in order to use to do their charitable work? I like bitcoins as much as everyone else but this just seems like you making it more difficult for the charity to get things done.
What is the benefit of donating anonymously(not sarcasm as someone that takes his privacy seriously i am honestly curious)?
