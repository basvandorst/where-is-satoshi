What’s the problem with that. It’s efficiency. Reddit for me is a free exchange of ideas/info. Regardless of wether it is a cartoon/video/meme, etc. People upvote if the find value in what it’s posted. Regardless of the delivery method.

There is a huge difference between talking about something and immersing yourself in something. The masses are conditioned to repeat talking points, case in point ☝��. Talk to me when you’re grandma has a significant stake in the game. The 1 in 25 Koreans who are participating have an average of $5300 invested. And the are consider market movers.

You've just outlined exactly why the blockchain revolution is so important. In a centralized banking system, if the U.S is experiencing deflation the bank (a Private business) can decide to do whatever it wants with your deposits. You don't have competing economies (or currencies, as currencies are usually backed by a nations economy). If the U.S economy is experiencing deflation and you live their, too bad, here is your USD, good luck!.( physical economies are geographically specific ). You have to deal with whatever the central bank wants to do. In the blockchain economy, Bitcoin is not going to be the only store of wealth. You're are going to see competing stores of wealth(coins) valued (by the community) for whatever decentralize solution they offer and backed by the demand for that solution. Just basic Supply/Demand. Ultimately the transacting parties determine its nominal value. A real free market. Not this mutation that they call capitalism. 
We are very fortunate to have a viable alternative to the current paradigm, were, because of fractional reserve banking, the banks leverage your deposits (to pay for wars, pollute your waters, poison your food, addict you to drugs) for the sake of profit. We almost annihilated ourselves. Or rather the plutocrats almost annihilated us. WE are about to experience the biggest transfer of wealth in history. Once the migration to blockchain is complete whoever invest wisely will profit immensely. It's time for someone else to be in charge of the wealth. We don't need to take back the means of production. We need to take back the means of financing production. 
Vive la Révolution!

My investments thesis is to deploy capital exclusively into MLM gypsy scams coming out of Bulgaria..

It’s crazy how many people are susceptible to scams.

Check out “The Missing Crypto Queen” podcast form the BBC. It’s a crypto thriller of a Bulgarian mafia backed scam.

Very accurate, except for that whole fungibility thing that people refuse to address.  Cash is King,  Monero is Cash, Monero is King!

Can you link a reputable source that speaks of zero compensation. From the little research I’ve done it seems like all parties will be justly compensated. 
Also, how did these non-Africans come to acquire so much land. In the most illegitimate way possible, apartheid. Economic value tends to aggregate around property, something many native South Africans were deprive of, while the colonizer reaped and continue to reap the benefits of the previous governments policies.

Who was the land originally acquired, apartheid. That sounds racist..
