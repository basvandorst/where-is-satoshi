Ludicrous. 


You'd just run a p2pool or solo mine. BAM. You've just used your hardware to (continuously) contribute the maximum potential that it ever can to securing the network. The idea that you'd keep "secret" hardware to "surprise" an attacker with extra hash-rate is probably one of the most outrageous things I've read on this subreddit for weeks.

Please look into cold storage / offline storage perhaps with a wallet like Electrum. You  can monitor the balance of addresses with blockchain.info to see if people have paid you.
As for the details about formally selling the land, well, seems you'll have to find a lawyer specializing in property in that country. Just explain it is a trade / agreed terms sale. If there is a trust issue you can get a 3rd party escrow involved, or, use multi-signature transactions to release the finds by all parties approving it.
But at the end of the day if you say "bitcoin only!" you are probably cutting back your list of buyers greatly. I think your better option would be to sell the land for fiat and then look at getting a broker as linked by other commentators who can buy large quantities of coin for you (that is their specialty).
Of course none of this is legal advice just my unqualified thoughts on the matter. Do you due diligence and speak to a lawyer etc..

For each box on your network:
* Make sure you have remote desktop disabled or you have non-default usernames and strong passwords for all the machines
or 
* Strictly and thoroughly disable remote features eg. remote desktop (RDP), VNC, etc.
as there are those who will attempt to use username/password lists (millions long) or even bruteforce remote logins when your IP address is eventually revealed and aggregated by certain websites*. 
Make sure the operating systems are fully up to date as well.
(You should also be very confident in how your router/gateway handles NAT, port forwarding, etc if you decide to leave those feature enabled.)
Note*: The websites that aggregate and display IP addresses running full nodes (bitcoin-qt / Core) are not inherently malicious, however, they obviously lend themselves to certain elements who would use them maliciously. Accordingly I have not specified any particular site but there are several. If you are really concerned (you should be) then run a proxy / tunnel / TOR or something to hide your external IP.

Are you claiming that all mining is not profitable?
No doubt some hardware and operational situations will not be profitable. Many people were burned badly with early-generation ASIC miners for SHA-256 coins. But some are profitable. All of my GPU's have attained ROI and then some.
Almost everyone mining in 2012 or earlier on GPU (on SHA-256 or scrypt, as appropriate at the time) should've been making excellent profits: even more so if they held until after 2013 before cashing out. It's only since the recent price crash (~Mt Gox shutdown) that GPU miners appear unprofitable at these current prices (BTC and altcoin price considered). If bitcoin prices rise in the future (as we'd hope) then they will again be profitable (on scrypt-n, etc). The only time the market price truely matters to a cryptocurrency miner is the price at the exact moment they cash out.

"RAID is NOT a backup" is a saying from IT folk (eg. sysadmins) Google it if you don't believe me. I recognize what you are saying though. Backing up data is actually a methodology that can be studied and implemented to mitigate disastrous events. It is distinct from redundancy (fault tolerance) of single pieces of hardware.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:44:05
Mt Gox is not claiming double spending. Any indication that they were, is actually them referring to their own system(s) and how it interacts with the customer.
This is at heart a problem with Gox's backend, it's not a problem with the protocol. There are ways they could've prevented this problem. For example, other exchanges which have better coding will most likely avoid suffering from this vulnerability entirely.
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:00:45
You are well off base trying to mine with a laptop.
You need to investigate:
i) Buying one or more ASIC miners for SHA-256 coins (including bitcoin). and/or
ii) Look into mining scrypt coins on graphics cards.
Both have pros and cons. If you are starting from scratch with very little IT hardware then its probably going to be an uphill struggle.

Although, as an experienced ebay seller, I can assure you it's just a matter of time until we all eventually run across a "difficult customer" or a scammer masquerading as one.
The classic ones in my case are when I sell an item as "For parts of not working" condition, with "FAULTY" in the title, and the list of faults in the description, but hey, they receive the goods and are SHOCKED that it doesn't plug in and work like new, so they demand a refund, and paypal/ebay will always side with the buyer and they'll be free to tarnish my feedback.

It's not a virus because they can only CPU mine or, in the best case, GPU mine. It's extremely unlikely that there would be a prevalent ASIC-infecting virus.
ASIC make previous generations of exploited hardware irrelevant. We're now &gt;50 PH/s. A single 1 TH/s ASIC miner worth $3000-5000 vastly outmines 10000-100000 infected CPU/GPU clients.

It depends on what you think the long term will be like for bitcoin. I consider bitcoin to be a building block that teaches people about the concept of cryptocurrency. In my opinion bitcoin will never grow to take even a single-digit percentage of global transactions eg. from Visa and Mastercard like a lot of true believers here will try to convince you could actually happen. It might take 10, 50, 100, or more years but eventually bitcoin will fail in some way or another or simply replaced by a superior cryptocoin (in the "best case" I guess).
As the "IT guy" to a lot of my friends and all of my family I absolutely understand that "ordinary" people do struggle with bitcoin. Importantly though, folk like OP who want to invest and hold bitcoin as a part of their wealth portfolio are inherently not being "ordinary" with bitcoin. What we are talking about for "ordinary" people is for them to use bitcoin as a payment system, not a wealth storage system or investment opportunity. In the case of the latter, a lack of researching / due diligence is not an excuse when failure occurs.
On a less related note I think that hardware wallets could fill the niche for people who might want to pay / receive bitcoin but don't want to worry about salted SHA ciphers or getting a PhD in maths or cryptography.
Lastly I just wanted to point out that any and every currency system is flawed in some way. Take cash for example as probably the simplest example that virtually everyone in the western world is intimately familiar with. Even with cash shit happens. Wallets go missing. Notes burns in house fires or change gets lost under the car seat. Banks get robbed. People get mugged. People get scammed and hand over their cash just as easily as someone gets taken by a shitty javascript RNG.

Yes you need a second computer, you could pick one up from any IT auction or ebay for less than $50 which will probably be something like a core 2 duo / 2-4 gb ram and a small-ish hard drive. It doesn't have to be a supercomputer. You can get keyboard+mice combos for $10 in my country (Australia) so if you are from USA it should be cheaper. Then you can get some cheap adapters or cables (even if its just a VGA cable) and connect it to the secondary input of your computer monitor, or, a TV.
It doesn't interact or need to interact with the blockchain. Your private keys are stored on the offline computer. The offline computer really only does two things: i. store your private keys associated with your address(es), and ii. use those private keys to sign (authorize) bitcoin transactions. 
The online computer doesn't have the private keys stored anywhere, so it operates with a "read only" type wallet: the program can only read your balances and see your transactions, but not send BTC. This means there is nothing for an online attacker to steal.
You make a unsigned transaction with the "read only" wallet on your online computer (which can only view balances and transactions, not send funds (a bit like how you can copy/paste any address into blockchain.info and see its associated info, right? Just like that.). Copy the unsigned transaction file to a USB stick, then plug it into the offline computer which will use the private key in its wallet to sign the transaction. You then take the USB key back to the on-line computer with the signed transaction file on it, and broadcast the transaction to the network (blockchain).
If you're hyper-paranoid about malware, you can use a intermediate computer to 'scan' the USB key thoroughly between the offline and online computer. You could also use QR codes to get this data from A to B.
It's exactly the same as with Electrum but the GUI isn't as 'new'.
Does this help?
OnlineArmory: Hey bro, this is not a full wallet. This is a read-only wallet. You can't send shit.
You: Oh really? How do I send funds?
OnlineArmory: I don't know the private key to that address, so I can't move the BTC. I can't do anything. Come back to me when you have signed this transaction you wanted to do using the private keys (gives you unsigned transaction file).
You: Cheers! (Takes USB key to offline computer with armory and private keys stored in its wallet file).
OfflineArmory: Oh you need that signed? No worries. I added that information. Here is a new signed transaction file. Take it to an online computer and broadcast it.
You: (Goes back to on-line computer).
You: OnlineArmory, bro, here's the signed file you asked for. Now send it to the network so I can move these BTC. K thnx.
OnlineArmory: Yep, this looks legit. I like it. Done.
PS: Is your encrypted wallet file backed up elsewhere? If your lacie HDD dies, do you have another way of accessing those funds? *Don't be that guy who doesn't have a backup...*
(Edits for clarity. Also if you are still confused you should download Armory or Electrum and just try it with a few $ worth of bitcoins. The whole procedure of authorizing a transaction with a offline computer can be done in &lt;60 seconds.)

1. Ebay will remove these sooner or later when it causes them too many headaches (chargebacks to action, low tier staff confused as to what is going on, etc.) It's happened before it will happen again.
2. Ebay is regional, just because .com now allows it doesn't mean that .yourcountry allows it. (Assuming you're not from USA).
3. Mining contracts on ebay will be almost universally scams. You will either get plainly ripped off or you will never EVER get "ROI". Avoid like the plague. If you must, why not find a reputable offer on the bitcointalk forums.
4. This does not mean that bitcoin is now a replacement for paypal. Indeed offering to recieve bitcoin for a sale could still get you in trouble with ebay/paypal.

While it's true that mining is harder now for the small folk, there are still people with "small" amounts of hardware, although it's true that these are probably not people who are new to this scene. 
As for if they break even against electricity costs depends on their location and energy supplier.

It's correct. Compare the cooling capacity (rating) of an air conditioner to the electricity consumption. They're usually in a 3:1 ratio (respectively).
This effect is exploited in heat pump water heaters: they move heat from one location and use it to heat water.

Some units are complicated and can be switched to source from different locations (ie. during different seasons).

The saddest part is that even if millions of these machines were infected, the profits that the attacker would get from mining bitcoin are nil. CPU mining is two tech generations behind for bitcoin.

It's a combined CPU/GPU called an APU.
Generally speaking you cannot safely mine on a laptop as they are not designed for continuous high loads. I'm not saying its impossible but the failure rate is going to be much higher.
You need to look at ASIC mining hardware or GPU that you can dedicate to mining.

It's funny reading these comments. There is clearly strong negativity from a lot of commentators. I've hung around this subreddit long enough to see a pattern of this happening and it varies with whatever the market is doing. Not only are miners/traders/investors "down in the dumps" right now, but we see "outsiders" actively looking to rag on bitcoin: these people don't actually have any experience with bitcoin themselves and they're just trying to make us feel bad because the market currently "seems bad". They're here only to say "told you so" and offer nothing else to the discussion.
Contrast this to when we're seeing a bull market and there are sustained and regular rallies. Oh look. Now bitcoin is the greatest thing on the planet. It's going to revolutionize the worlds finances. Tell all your friends about how great bitcoin is. Where can I buy bitcoin?

I suppose my question/issue was really "what does the ATO consider evidence" because to me (science background) "evidence" is not necessarily the same as a "record". One is fallible but one is not.
For example people in other comments say they will just use a energy meter on their rigs and could show the ATO their rigs current average reading. Well, over a 1 year time frame I've probably changed my setup 20 times. So it would never be possible to "prove" my energy readings during those existing configurations, aside from keeping a spreadsheet of how it changed over time. I will start a spreadsheet to monitor the consumption of my mining rigs over time...
I would assume that mining would not be considered capital gains, but if you are buying and selling coins like any commodity then I'd assume capital gains would be most appropriate. I believe the ATO has addressed trading bitcoins before but not specifically mentioned mining. In any case I assume we could apply for a ruling.
It would be really great to find someone who can do my tax returns who does have some idea what bitcoin is. I loathe the idea of explaining it to someone who's never heard of it.

Unencrypted wallet.dat floating around on cloud storage sites, with no 2FA on those sites, and presumably a bunch of other security no-no's, and you had over $1,500 USD of BTC on your wallet?
There is a certain point, where you need to think "hey, all my eggs in this basket, what happens if that basket is dropped?!" which is about the time you start taking your security more seriously and investigate more secure ways of storing/using your coin. It looks like you've learned the hard way.

I know a guy who paid for a BFL single in $ soon after first hearing about bitcoin (this was some time ago). He waited 8 months for it to arrive. He set it up and it did its thing. Then he lost all their bitcoins because they had kept it all online in Mt Gox. 
I felt really sorry for the guy. Then I realised that there would be countless other people who were not really aware or familiar enough with cryptocurrency goings-on and would've had exactly the same kind of things happen to them. In this case the guy was a full time worker with plenty of cash to throw around for fun, so he didn't really mind.

My understanding was that the exploiter would open a support ticket, and get their original transaction sent again, because from the exchange's point of view, the original transaction was never completed. 
Thus the exchange loses - and the exploiter gains - the same amount, equal to whatever the value of the original transaction was.

You are being downvoted because Mt.Gox did not just magically up one day and die. There were MANY severe and worrying signs that they were on their way out. Anyone who followed bitcoin at all should have seen their  monumental trail of fuck-ups and blame-gaming well before the time they froze funds and shut down.
I have very little sympathy for anyone who was a long term user of Gox and got caught out. If people were using an exchange like a bank - one of the most critical things that is supposed to be learned by new bitcoin users and is basically spewed across every wiki and blog page about bitcoin - then they can only blame themselves. Hell, half of the exchanges running today explicitly warn you not to use them for long term funds storage.

Also keep in mind that many of your above points refer to businesses. Indeed there are some users on the forums using vanity addresses for their businesses: but the vast majority are casual/enthusiast users who are helping others and leaving a vanity address in their sig in case anyone would like donate some coins to thank them for their efforts. For example see the generosity of the users, not necessarily just in relation to the large donation drives (eg. NASCAR at the moment) but also for the much smaller user-to-user donations. It's the same on the forums. Especially in the tech/hardware help forums. (Vanitygen can make addresses for most (all?) coins, not just bitcoin).

Your opinion.


Vanitygen (refer to the large thread on bitcointalk) has been out for a long time and there has been no vulnerabilities shown. If you really are worried about the security of that address (for some reason?) then you could simply use it as a transaction address not a storage or cold storage address.

p2pool.org is a perfectly fine "no hassle" *altcoin pool*. Obviously there is very little going for it if you intend to mine BTC, compared to other pools with many features and perks.

Its funny that if you read most aftermarket CPU cooler manuals it warns you that because of the weight of the product you should not move them large distances or be too rough with moving them after they're installed. I would assume that shipping via a plane and all the handling at airports would qualify for this.
If I were to buy one of these I would rather the coolers shipped unopened in their box along with the miner and install them myself. But I can appreciate that if a company allowed this then countless fools would screw it up and break their investment. The other option is ironically, broken miners. Sigh.

Unless you live in Australia in which case no hardware will likely ever be profitable to run from now on*. Our electricity costs are just too high. Congrats if you are somehow able to get/steal free power but for most of us the show is over.
Also, I looked at getting a AntMiner S3 from zoomhash (since everywhere else seems out of stock, perpetually), it was going to be about $399 for the unit and $199 for delivery. Well. Fuck.
Then I re-assured myself it was a terrible idea: some simple checks on bitcoinwisdom's calculator reavealed the unit would probably only pay for about 50% of its initial purchase price even with a very favorable set of conditions (very low diff increment, etc).
*Note: Unless you plan to hold BTC until it hopefully becomes worth several times it's current value, but most people are not interested in this kind of long term mining/investing, especially when 4-digit quarterly power bills are arriving.

You're argument based on "cost of mere $50M?" is ludicrous because if bitcoin was widely adopted and had "$100B of assets is tied to BTC" (what does that even mean, anyway?) then presumably the costs to buy the hardware would be much much greater than $50m.
As another guy in the top best comments here has pointed out, it would CURRENTLY cost at least $180m in asic hardware alone (no infrastructure or labor costs there) to pull this off, with very poor chance of preventing a newer, better, more resistant coin from rising from the ashes.

100% of the electrical energy going into the hard drive eventually becomes heat. Not only can I explain how, but we must expect this to be the case regardless because of the entropy of the universe, a fundamental concept of physics.
1. Rotation of the platters causes friction (heat) against air molecules inside the drive (hard drives operate at atmospheric pressure, they have breathing holes "Do not cover this hole" label..). The heat is moved from this air into the chassis of the drive.
2. Noise from the drive is (acoustically) inherently kinetic motion which  always results (eventually) in the production of heat since no kinetic process can be 100% efficient.

My point is you should do your due diligence before investing money in anything. You need to work out:
What are the costs?
What will the revenue be?
Hence what is the ROI?
What skills will I need to setup and operate the miner?
What are the hidden costs (Pool fees, delivery charges, etc)
What other equipment will I need? (Host computers or networking or cooling, power infrastructure, etc)
The list goes on and on.
So if you have to ask the question, the answer is no, because if the answer was yes you will have already researched these things and made your own conclusion.
Likewise, I cannot give you a "yes" or "no" answer because I know nothing about you and your situation. Maybe you're a broke college kid who can barely pay rent or his phone bill. Maybe you live in a country with extremely high electricity costs. Maybe you have $25,000 in debts you should attend to first. Do your own due diligence. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:22:01
Yes. You can compare them here:
Direct comparisons between scrypt and SHA-256 based coins are misleading. The "% profitability vs BTC" graphics in the link above can be misleading to newbs. The comparison is incorrect because the different kind of coins are mined on different hardware technologies. Thus you should analyze the situation for yourself. You can google " (some radeon graphics card) mining" to find estimates of hash rates from different cards based on people who already own those cards.
@_date: 2014-02-08 09:11:20
You should probably know already if you have a graphics card in your computer. If you don't then I'm not convinced that mining is up your alley.
By "discreet" GPU, that person meant that you have a "proper" PCI-e graphics card, not an onboard or in-cpu GPU.
The minimum GPU you would want to mine on would be something like a Radeon 7790 (about $120-140) which will give you about 240 kh/s in scrypt coins if you set it up properly and optimise it in the mining software.
You should checkout or the bitcointalk forum. It has many subforums for mining and mining hardware.
To mine a SHA-256 coin profitably you would need to purchase ASIC based mining hardware that is highly in demand (read: long waiting / pre-order periods) and are continously under pressure from the rising difficulty of bitcoin. A lot of miners using ASIC will not ever achieve ROI. 
I could present an argument that given hardware available for purchase right now (no waiting) its much easier to attain ROI with some carefully chosen GPU than by trying to buy ASICs.

i. You should not be using gox as any indicator of the worth of bitcoins. We've been saying this for years. It's now truer than ever. Please use bitcoinwisdom and select an exchange of interest or go to bitcoinaverage.
ii. The price drop is because Gox suspended withdrawals thank to an exploited vulnerability in their own poor code that resulted in them losing (probably not very many) bitcoins. The gox price will continue to plument for each day this drags on until their can fix their code and resume processing withdrawals.

The old way of writing these numbers completely confuse the situation.

What this sub-reddit needs to keep in mind is that there is a greater proportion of relatively highly educated people here in this subreddit. I would also argue that bitcoin users in general are also - on average - more educated than most.
So this creates a problem when we start talking about things that you (reader of and I start talking about: "microbitcoins" "milibitcoins": most people don't know what mili or micro mean.
If you were raised in a western country other than the USA, you should already know that mili means "1/1000th" or at least given enough time you should be able to work it out, since you should know that 1000 mL is one liter Although this is taught in highschool and even hopefully by parents at a young age, I'd still expect a very substantial (10-50%) of people would fail to demonstrate this knowledge if you quizzed them about it. This specific example is sadly where it ends for most folk. Even at university, I have done a lot of study in the field of chemistry, and its depressing how many 1st and even 2nd year students don't know that 1000 miligrams = 1 gram.
So you can probably see that if bitcoin was to see widespread adoption (as everyone in this subreddit seems to hope, probably gets them to sleep at night) that there are going to be many people who struggle with this.
Out of the 300+ million Americans, if you walked through a public mall and asked "what does the micro prefix mean" you would probably get &lt;5% of people answering correctly. This is just more things for new bitcoin users to learn and come to terms with, on top of the already (lets face it) very high learning curve. Most people I've discussed bitcoin with in the real world, who do not have a relevant degree in computing or finance fields, are extremely confused even trying to come to terms with the fact that their "fiat" is based on nothing and the "bitcoin" price is based on demand from users. It turns their understanding of their world upside down.
Getting back on track, I don't think "bits" is a good term for "microbitcoin". It is once-removed from another term (micro prefix) that is already generally poorly known. This doesn't even cover the issues that "bits" has a well established and very specific meaning in computing. (Computing being a closely related field to bitcoin, obviously). You can see how the discussion would go:

I don't agree. The site has been around for a long time (at least on the timeframes that cryptocoins work on). It should be pretty obvious that pointing your miner to their pool address (a server/IP), is not 'p2p' in the sense it would be if you were looking for the 'real p2pool'.
The only way you could be mislead, is if you were discussing it with someone, then googled it, then failed to see the Italian hosted bitcoin wiki page linked elsewhere in these comments. I am struggling to see any malicious intent aside from their almost identical names: there are plenty of companies and products that do this too, sometimes with some success and othertimes not so much (legal action). 
I maintain my opinion that, from the 2 years I've been mining and using the bitcointalk forum, the distributed P2Pool has seemed to have a poor reputation for ease-of-setup and usability, in fact it's usually a point of contention when it is mentioned. Thus I doubt the .org pool operators are really misleading too many miners in any case.
You'll also see at the bottom of every page on their site:




Also, I don't really think OP's title is appropriate. "control over the miners CPU" seems to indicate that they can remotely access your system or run their own tasks on your machine. This is nonsense. You are just mining shares with your existing miner software (eg. cgminer) to their pool addresses. They don't have access to ANYTHING. Heck, they have even less access to your information than most pools, because their site does not even require registration (ie. no email / username / password that can be sold/lost/leaked/stolen/hacked).
@_date: 2014-06-27 10:57:40


You can still mine other alorithms on graphics cards. I am so incredibly over this topic. You can then exchange these coins for bitcoin. Or you can mine on a pool that auto-sells and pays you in bitcoin (ethics of that process aside..). Research scrypt-n/x11/x13/kekkak or just buy bitcoins instead of mining them. Its no longer hard to obtain or operate ASICs in 2014 either. Bitcoin and other cryptos will see a diminishing number of miners in general going forward, as most people will just buy. As a miner since 2011, this is not a problem for me honestly.


So you probably can't protect your data in any case. Why not throw your PC away in the trash too. All or nothing right?


Bitcoin is 100% secure when you do it correctly. The discussion in this thread probably affects a small number of people who did absolutely no research (due diligence) for storing their substantial investment (sorry OP but its the truth). This site has come up as a problem in the past, as has the low-entropy private key generation topic countless times.


Sure, I bet no one has ever had money stolen from their bank or withdrawn without their permission. And I bet no one has ever been mugged. But hey bitcoin has identifiable problems X,Y,Z so it's clearly worthless, right?


There will always be people who are just careless with their money/wealth or simply just don't care. This applies to a lot more things in their lives than just bitcoin.

Yep I saw your video and my opinion is unchanged. A few minutes at high temperature from a propane torch doesn't compare to the oxidative stress of a house fire than could sustain high temperatures for 30+ minutes. I can understand that to someone who is (presumably) not a materials scientist, that 'blow torch = fire test', however its really not that simple.
I'd love to put one in one of our muffle furnaces for while to simulate realistic house fire temperatures in an air environment. I would suggest that a nickel based super alloy like one of the inconel variants would be a superior choice to any ferrous alloy like stainless. It may also have superior corrosion resistance in case someone drops their card into the ocean and it takes much longer than 45 days to retrieve it.. (a touch of sarcasm there).

That question is exactly the same as asking "My friend just brought a car, do you think he made the right decision?" and then posting absolutely no more info about the situation or what the car is.
My point: It depends entirely on:
- Their goal of mining: do they want to make epic profit$? Or just doing it for fun, as part of a interest/hobby, or for the "greater good" of helping the security of the bitcoin network (which is what mining does)
- Their financial state: Should this person be speculating on mining hardware? Is this a good financial decision for them? Is this their first attempt at investing or "striking it rich". Can they barely pay rent or their debts? Or do they throw cash around like nobodies business from their high paying job?
- Is it a pre-order or is the hardware in-hand goods that will be shipped straight away?
- Did the person do any profitability / difficulty / performance calculations before the purchased it?
- Do they know how to set it up, configure it, nurse it, and then how to manage the mined funds appropriately?
But principally, it depends on exactly what the hardware they purchased is. Who makes it and what model / product / variation is it?
As for the last question: "but isn't it a bit late to get into mining?". Sort of yes and no. If he was on top of his game and had the right hardware a few years ago, and was willing to wait / had foresight / fingers crossed then he could've made a lot of money very care free. But now, in 2014, mining is becoming more centralized by organizations and companies and individuals with huge amounts of $ to throw at hardware. I'm not talking $2k. I'm talking 20k and 200k or even more. These are the people who are placing themselves into situations deliberately to make profit and have more than likely positively satisfied all of the criteria I list above. 
Lastly, the general advice is: If you have to ask if you should buy a miner, the answer is always no. And: It's usually better to just buy and hold bitcoin than to try and make a profit mining.

I am a scientist. The electrical output (data signals) you are refering to account for such little power leaving the miner that you would completely disregard it in any energy or heat calculations. Most digital signals are short pulses at &lt;5 volts: they are incredibly tiny quantities of energy moving from one digital device to another.


"Data" (or knowledge) does not intrisically carry with it any energy. You can write down data on a piece of paper and no energy storage is really involved with that data. You cannot utilize that data to create work so by definition is carries no energy associated with it.

You can get cheap wattmeters at bunnings for about $25-30. They're OK but they run the digital electronics off coin cell batteries (silly i know, but its a compliance thing). 
If you can spare the money, get a more expensive ($80?) whole-house kind of wattmeter, like the efergy units, and splice open a power board's lead or an extension lead's outer sheath, install current transformer sensor around the active or neutral wire (you don't need to actually cut these wires) and then seal it up neatly in a enclosure. The benefit of this is wireless monitoring and you can run the sensor and receiver (display) unit off rechargeable AA or AAA batteries.

It could be liquid nitrogen cooled: but the heat output still has to go somewhere.

IOPs is going to be higher on a USB drive (relative to HDD),  clearly max data write speed is going to be slower than HDD and SSD unless the USB drive is truely unique (there a few extremely high performance ones which can read and write at over 100 MB/s). IOPs is of much greater importance because the files always fragment to a ridiculous degree no matter what type of drive you place it on. Usually 2000+ fragments (on a clean drive used for nothing else) if you leave it alone and it will quickly revert to this if you try to defragment it.

Because the market was at about $12 USD per BTC or less right as the block reward halving hit. To remain the same profitability for miners, the price would have had to quickly raise to $24.
However, clearly, it did not do this. The current price is about $13.50 and relatively stable.
This is a problem (at least in the short term) for the casual or enthusiast miner as they are - in the short term at least - mining at a loss.
The severity of the miners problem depends mostly on how much they pay for electricity. Some lucky miners pay nothing or have ridiculously low rates (eg $0.04 US equivalent per kW/h).
Miners such as myself, mining on just a graphics card or two, in countries with 'normal' electricity prices (eg Australia, currently $0.25/kWh) are really taking a beating. 
As for if the market will improve in the long term and make those who keep mining rich? Well who can say, the market is not very predictable as has been shown time and time again.

You raise valid points.

The payment processing company could easily decline my request or just ignore my message: in which case I am out of coin and with nothing to show for it and absolutely no recourse.

Bitcoin is different. If you fuck up, your money is gone. If your software environment isn't secure your money can easily be gone. If you adopt a methodology that is flawed while undertaking some complex transactions, your money is gone.

In all honesty Bitcoin is still not anywhere near a well known thing in Australia: you'd be lucky if 1 in 100 people know what is and even a fraction less could explain how it works or could say they've used it. I don't think you'd have an easy time explaining it to a tax agent. The end of the conversation with them would just have to be like this: "I paid $X in costs and made $Y back, my profit was $Z and it needs to be taxed." 
If you call the ATO asking for advice then the person who answers the phone does a search for relevant keywords from your question in their document database and then they *literally read to you verbatim from the documents they have pertaining to your question*. It's quite unusual and you'll know what I mean if you've called them, it is like talking to a human robot. If you ask about bitcoin then I suspect they will be completely lost because they doubtfully have any written advice on the topic. I think the article here is proof of that.
I consider bank transactions to be fully transparent to the ATO. Indeed, their systems of monitoring banks are most likely automated or at least partly automated. I'm sure people buying and selling BTC using bank transfers could be caught out by this but I like to think that anyone with enough money to invest or trade in BTC wouldn't be so blind to the tax implications.
The serious questions start to be raised with mining BTC because for tax purposes it seems like money is being made from no where. I know there will be at least a few people who have run GPU / FPGA farms and now ASIC devices who would probably make enough BTC in a tax year to get on the radar of the ATO. I suppose it all falls down to how they use the BTC once they have it.
In the end the sad truth of the matter is that like all tax agencies the ATO is a law unto itself so you'll pay whatever they calculate your BTC Tax to be or go down fighting it.

I suspected this as well. On mid June they announced they had [made 1 \(one\) 16 chip board]( for testing.
It seems like a leap that they can go from making one board for testing, to making hundreds or thousands of boards in a very short time frame (now till September) to begin shipping orders by the promised date. 
The photos on the site indicate they hired a small office for their work, but it doesn't look like a place to be making so much hardware. Are they outsourcing the electronics work? Are they supplying a contractor with the avalon chips and having them do the bulk of the production?

I've been around this reddit a while. These questions have come up before. In fact, I'd bet at least weekly, perhaps daily now we've had a little 'boom' in attention. We've got the true believers versus the deniers. We've got those that will call it a scam, or a pyramid scheme, or whatever have you. We've got lots who have never spent 5 minutes reading the .it wiki and yet claiming to have some grand knowledge about bitcoin and its future. We've got PhDs in economics saying how its not going to work, and we're wasting our time, and how they've seen it all before. We've got people giving poor answers to questions they know, or think they know, or simply don't know. We've got those invested heavily in conventional markets, assets, investments etc. who will never change their mind about bitcoin. We've got those who have millions of dollars worth of bitcoins, who have always wondered why everything except bitcoin seems so backwards.
I say, instead of endlessly playing question/answer games, lets look at what is happening. We went from something worth &lt;$0.01 USD/BTC in 2010 to $1050+ at present. There is a demand for bitcoins. If there were so many immense problems with bitcoins then they'd still be worth next to nothing, but this is not the case. 
Bitcoin is not a static entity. It is under development. It can and does change, in fact, it does this rapidly. Much faster than other currency systems. Bitcoin may not be the coin that takes us into the distant future, if there is any for cryptocoins. However I fail to see how or why they would all simply vanish, they will always have utility to some people. In 50 or 100 years time, if cryptocoins become commonplace, then its not going to be the current implementation of bitcoin: it will be some new, faster, more scalable coin that was built from the lessons learned from bitcoin. But for now, we have something that works, something that is growing.

We'd revert to trade and barter system if electronic financial systems failed. Then, as we rebuilt, we'd revert to the more convenient conventional currencies and bitcoins. There would be price fluctuations, but we already have those. Humans are inherently materialistic and will always find ways to add value to objects no matter how intangible they might actually be (eg. bitcoins are just a string of binary digits). Your gold and silver is probably in a bank or fed somewhere in another part of the country or world and good luck physically getting it if the 'shit hits the fan' like in your above scenario. Unless you have it hidden under your bed, your gold and silver would be just as worthless as bitcoins.

Took 1 hour for me too. I didn't actually know banks could process cash to an account that fast, because I am used to doing electronic transactions between accounts. For example, send funds to via online banking from my account to another bank for the first time typically takes up to 2 business days.

2000 BTC is not much to the very early adopters. With CPU mining you could mine tens/hundreds/thousands of BTC per day. Later when GPU mining came out you could still mine whole integers of BTC in a day with a mid range card. These people have a lot of coin to play with.

Their price is inflated ONLY because you can buy them right now, and get them posted to  you immediately. There are not many (any?) other sources of ASIC hardware that can get you an ASIC in the mail today. (ASICMiner shares don't count).
Once another source of ASIC are actively posting out orders (I'm hesitant to refer to BFL here, are they really fulfilling general customers orders yet?) and the demand for ASICs reaches some kind of equilibrium (ie. they are commonplace and GPU mining is irrelevent), then there is a  going to be an abundance of these erupters floating around with very low prices. In a year or two it is possible that 336 MH/s erupters won't even be worth a mining enthusiasts time and they will just be given away as gifts (as was the original intention of the devices, IIRC).

Australia is always in the slow lane with technology like this. I suspect in 10 years time they will acknowledge bitcoin as 'a thing' and actually pay some real attention to it.
Would I have to keep calculations on my electricity and hardware expenses versus the BTC mined? On what time periods? On which market exchange? With varying luck of which alt coins I was mining instead?
They only way I can see that they could monitor the use of BTC of us poor peons is if they had a number of exchanges that were checked for on bank statements when people purchased and sold BTC via bank transfers. I don't see how they could track anything else without actively requesting specific records from various international companies and organisations. Even still there are plenty of ways that it could be hard to prove anything. For example you buy $500 of BTC in cash from a guy at a cafe you met from a local exchange service. Then what? How do they track and then try and tax that? Have they even thought of that?

@_date: 2013-10-15 05:24:03
There are three outcomes as far as I can see. Difficult to give any actual timeframes though. I suppose only time will tell:
- Mining carries on with rising exponentially increasing difficulty, finally reaches some kind of maximum in hash rate increase, begins to taper off or maintain a constant rate of increasing hash rate
- Mining diff rises exponentially until some kind of event occurs that massively disrupts mining in general. A lot of people may lose out on ever attain ROI/break even and lots of sad people all around the place in general.
- A new technology superior to ASIC is developed that obliterates difficulty measurements completely and unheard of diff values are attained. Although its not clear how this would happen or what technology it would be based on. If we look back into the CPU mining days, only a few people would've seen GPU mining coming (eg those who had already been using GPU for med/sci applications (distributed computing)). Even fewer would've foreseen FPGA miners (probably only electronics engineers / chip experts). Fewer still would've expected ASIC to be a realistic or affordable option. I am hesitant to mention quantum computers because they are not really designed for performing hashing-type operations directly. Although there are some commercially available 'quantum computers' (eg. D-wave) they are certainly going to be out of the realm of average or even enthusiast Joe and Jane for some time into the future, and in their current form could not mine anyway. But given that in just 24 months we have seen CPU-&gt;FPGA-&gt;GPU-&gt;ASIC I suspect in the next 24 months we will see some special new things.

Personally I find it is not a problem once the block chain is downloaded and processed if I leave the program running 24/7. On my other machines, which don't have SSDs, I run it with the data directory kept on 8GB USB drives, which require nil power to operate and are inexpensive (&lt;$5 now!).

Because you're too lazy to google and read the paper: Copy/Pasta for you:
Difficulty Adjustability of Proof-of-Work
One of Bitcoin’s innovations is the introduction of adjustable difficulty. This allows
cryptocurrency to achieve controlled minting and relatively constant transaction
Paul Erdıs 1913-1996
processing capacity. The advent of GPU mining and later ASIC mining of SHA-256
hashcash proof-of-work did not impact its inflation model exactly due to this mechanism.
Of course, hashcash’s linear difficulty model made it easy. For prime proof-of-work, it is
not apparent how this could be achieved. Initially I thought about using prime size as an
indicator of difficulty. However, a non-linear difficulty curve would negatively impact
block chain security. Also, using prime size as difficulty indicator would interfere with
efficiency of verification. Eventually I discovered that the remainder of Fermat test could
be used to construct a relatively linear continuous difficulty curve for a given prime chain
length. This allows primecoin to largely keep the security property of bitcoin.
Let k be the prime chain length. The prime chain is p0, p1, …, pk-1. Let r be the Fermat
test remainder of the next number in chain pk. Now pk/r is used to measure the
difficulty of the chain. Even though the distribution of r/pk is not strictly uniform, but
experiments have shown that the difficulty adjustment behavior is reasonably good in
practice. The prime chain length is then computed with a fractional length part:
d = k + (pk-r)/pk
Note if pk passes probable primality tests then it should be considered as a chain of
higher integral length.
A continuous length target adjustment is employed with similar features to the difficulty
adjustment in ppcoin [King 2012]. Length target is stepped up or down through integral
boundaries during length target adjustment, at fixed step-up/step-down threshold of
255/256 &lt;-&gt; 1.

My experience with this service:
After a headache trying to convert AUD-&gt;BTC fairly quickly (&lt;1 day) I ended up trying CoinJar filler (their cash deposit service). I deposited $100 cash at a commonwealth bank which was admittedly the first time I had done so, and it was surprisingly fast and went very smoothly (as you'd expect from Australias 'first bank' etc...)
CoinJar confirmed the transaction after exactly 60 minutes via SMS and a few minutes later I had exchanged the AUD-&gt; BTC on their site, and then had BTC sent to my wallet right away (well, waiting for confirmations now...).
**I am very happy with this service and would definitely recommend it.** At the time I did the transfer, bitstamp prices were about $84USD/BTC and the CoinJar buy rate was at $95 AUD/BTC, MUCH lower than spendbitcoins which was $104 AUD/BTC.
Apparently, in 7 days time my account deposit limit will increase from $100 AUD to $500 AUD which is pretty reasonable. As far as I'm concerned the only downside to using this service is that I have to go outside!
Also pleased that the process is quasi-anonymous, bank did not take any of my details.
*The only slight hitch (very minor I guess) was that the when signing up their SMS confirmation code didn't send the first time (within 30 seconds) so I sent a second one (as instructed on the site) and it succeeded that time.*
tl-dr; I am a happy panda, did cash deposit at commbank: confirmed within 1 hour and got btc within minutes after that, relatively good conversion rate

Yes but it only changes difficulty once per 8 days. In theory if google started right after a difficulty change they'd have one week to do some damage. 
HOWEVER the number of coins mined would probably not be increased by as much as some would think. This comes down to the already high hashing power of the network (recently exceeding 1 exaflop) and the unsuitable hardware which would be in google's datacenters (mostly CPU cores which are poor at mining coins).
What I am sure about is, they would never make the money back to pay the power bill and the other costs of running those datacenters, let alone the damage to their company from not having resources to run their services.

To be fair, they are not taking orders (yet?), so it's not really necessary to instantly declare this as fake or a scam. Many legit manufactures of hardware today were initially accused of being scammers.
But on the other hand, the site is a very poor effort. A picture of a coolermaster case? Wow. Copy paste from their website. It would actually have been better to find some pictures of some dell / HP / IBM servers without the bezels on the front of them and then mod the image so that it can't be reverse image searched, at least then some people might consider it. But this will still only fool noobs looking to make some quick cash who are not experience with computer hardware. The long term bitcoin miners and hardware enthusiasts won't fall for such tricks.
Some random text about supposed specs? Again no real effort there.

Alternatively, electrum offers cold storage style wallets that can be run on a offline computer. You can use a online computer to monitor the balance of the addresses in the wallet, but not spend. You can recover the wallet with the seed phrase made while creating the wallet in the first instance.
This way you can share the public address and fund it to your hearts content, however you can only spend by signing the transaction with the offline computer first and then broadcasting it from an online system.
I recommend you try and test the entire process before using a significant quantity of coins on it. That way you will understand what you are doing. It's a solid system and very little can go wrong if you are careful.

Electricity rates in Australia are quite high, about $0.28 per kW/h or more after tax. My calculations show it is no longer worth mining BTC or even alt coins anymore with my GPU collection. It is hard to justify $700+ power bills every quarter when the return isn't there from BTC.

Because it is in demand, because of its utility, and more recently because some investers are worried about 'missing out' on huge gains from bitcoin...
The conceptual problem you are struggling with is (probably) that for your whole life you have been told that Item X is worth Y dollars. Bitcoin varies in price greatly because they are available in limited quantity and a lot of people want them. The only other way most people will get exposure to this kind of thing is if you have shares, and even then you probably have a broker/accountant/agent that does it on your behalf, since most people don't have the fundamentals to manage them themselves.
Also, on a very technical level, the absolute minimum value is based on a combination of miners electricity costs and hardware costs. However as utility is always &gt;&gt; you will never see prices based solely on these two factors alone.

You don't just walk up to random chip manufacturer and place an order for some ASIC's to be delivered to you the next day.

It depends on the length you want and if you want it capitalised exactly. For example you'll find a randomly captialised version of any pattern much faster than if you required it to be all upper or lower case, for example. You can specify it to ignore case with the '-i' command.
OP was working at 145Kkey/s which is 0.145 MKey/s. My 4 GPU's can get over 70 MKey/s and anyone with a bunch of 7950's in a litecoin mining rig could probably get up to 100 MKey/s or more. 
As an example, I found a private key for a "1P1azmo" prefixed address in about 5 minutes using 3/4 of my cards where it took him 7+ hours:
    Next match difficulty: 15021179970 (37 prefixes)
    Pattern: 1P1azmo
    Address: 1P1azmoLxsvhENwftKbNRS8nXP7bcPYYKL
    Privkey: 5KM8Qz2Qqcu2VEvDZanEE7QydfDBLVYKnPdGokV32LKSCWnXvek
It should be obvious that no one should use the above private key / address.
You also greatly increase your chances of finding address patterns that interest you if you compile a list of them and always run all of them whenever you are using vanitygen programs. For example in the above you can see that this one was just one of 37 patterns it was looking for.
Found another 3 in the time it took me to write this:
    Pattern: 1P1azmo
    Address: 1P1azmo3YpY9schLQQmUC7Gwdi8kbUnz31
    Privkey: 5KNhxTTQ5NEM1DmaQWzpxJbe7du2AmvenkbCvCoouhohKxu92WW
    Pattern: 1P1azmo
    Address: 1P1azmo2xEQKT9fLcnzLSiyQLmfabRqe3p

As the only technical-minded ('computer savvy' / 'computer guy') in my close and even extended family, the "bitcoin is for criminals by criminals" thing really is annoying and an up-hill battle in discussions.
Like when I explain how I have not only negated my power bill by mining various cryptocoins, but also got free heating from my equipment during winter, and made a little profit too, only to see their faces scrunch up when I mention that "bitcoin" thing was involved. All they had ever heard about it was from the conventional media running stories exactly like CGPG mentioned. From then on it's an upwards battle. I actually think that my family may think less of me / may think I am buying drugs, but only because they can't prove I'm not and because they would probably think it fits my lifestyle well (sheltered, geeky single guy, living alone and seldom visiting them etc...) = probably stoned all the time *riiiiiiiiiiiiight*?
There are very few angles to attack the conversation from then, because it usually appears as though:
* Bitcoin is against the banks and governments, thus it is 'underground', 'unnofficial', 'unproven' or inherently illegitimate, or created by anarchist basement dwelling programmers trying to overthrow the powers that be. Thus, it is something they think they should not be involved in, because they have always been good tax-paying law-abiding citizens.
* It's too technical. Yes, you have to learn new words, and think about your security more than with your bank. Most people are terrible at computer security in general. Just damned terrible. I think this is one of bitcoin's biggest challenges.
* It can't buy 'normal things'. Yes, **YOU** - savvy reddit techno-geek reader - probably know heaps of places that use and accept bitcoins. But most people don't! The only place they hear that accepts it that naughty Silk Road place, where assassins can be had for B0.01 and terrorists can arm entire cells with ease from all the blackmarket weapons sold there, if they aren't first taken aside by all the coke they'll be snorting, that is.
So I am sad to say, that despite my extensive knowledge and experience with mining and using BTC, I do not usually discuss it with anyone in my family now. The only people I will mention it to are tech-savvy friends who I think could benefit from it in some way. A good example was a international student buddy who needed to transfer money with his family, bitcoin revolutionized that for him once his folks figured it out.

Typically the bitcoin buyer will do a reversal and then you'll lose both your coins that you sent and the money that was reversed.

Just because he is gambling with bitcoins doesn't inherently make him a deceptive individual. For all you know and can prove, this guy was just doing what he said: looking to make some BTC for a new laptop. Each to their own, when you go through college/university you have to weasel your way into every source of income you can. If this guy has found a way to make some extra coin then good on him. I realise that he might have genuinely stuffed up but in that case why would he make this post and then not ask for donations? Surely even if he neglected to mention the latter he would not get anywhere near what he lost in the first place.
I stand by my point that if someone gives him bitcoins out of sympathy it doesn't have anything to do with you and your bitcoins, so why are you horridly offended at the idea. 
Your entire post comes across as if you are a spitefully untrusting and cold person:

Using some clients and some wallet providers, you can elect your own transaction fee that will be paid along with your transaction.

You might want to add that bitcoin transactions are non-reversible. If you send bitcoins to someone, there is no way to get them back unless you beat that person with a rubber hose until they decide to. 
If you worry about a transaction, use a 3rd party to arbitrate a transaction (can be done for example via blockchain.info) where all 3 parties must agree to the transfer of the coins for them to actually be moved. Also, lots of escrow services around (bitcointalk has megathreads on this).

Coinjar is great but not for single large purchase especially without an increased buying limit.
I would recommend against BTC-e but that is just my personal opinion.
Just ensure you are removing these coins from exchange ASAP to a wallet you control that is secured to a good standard (look at cold storage methods). I also recommend using 2 factor authentication on those sites before you send a deposit to them. Be sure you have tested the 2FA fully before depositing AND backup your 2FA appropriately in case your phone or 2FA hardware fails unexpectedly and you cannot access your funds/coins.

At least in Australia, we have no choice but to accept Paypal. All other payment options are between the seller and the buyer. HOWEVER if you don't use PayPal and there is a payment dispute things can get ugly as it is very unlikely eBay would even consider looking into a bitcoin transaction (their attitude is just: "You didn't use PayPal, suck shit.")
You cannot de-select PayPal as a seller in your payment options. And if you put something in your listing like "PayPal not accepted" or "Cash Only" then you can have the listing removed (and a mark put against your account) and if you continue it may result in the account being banned.

Well slow clap to you sir, you can make ASCII tables. But you missed a extremely critical point about the usefulness of gold in todays world.
Gold is one of very few elements in a non-alloyed form that can resist oxidation indefinitely in a normal environment. You can leave gold out in the weather for years and come back and its still there: it hasn't oxidized or tarnished or corroded etc. This makes it invaluable in modern electronics as any components that connect or contact each other need to be able to maintain electrically sound surfaces indefinitely. This is why you find gold plated pins on more or less everything in computers (essentially all connections other than power connectors), phones, communications equipment etc.
If you've ever worked with silver (the other element you choose) you'll know just how absurdly fast it can tarnish in even favorable atmospheric conditions. Thus its not appropriate to plate electronic contacts with silver.
Gold is also a useful in catalysis in industry.
There are other metals that will also carry some properties similar to gold, like platinum and iridium and a few of the even rarer elements, but these are so precious and expensive that their use is ruled out for all but the most critical and specific uses that they lend themselves to. Gold is relatively abundant and thus relatively cheap and so finds use in what I've described above. Check out the contacts in/on your phone some time or inside a computer or even on a network cable if you are not sure what I am talking about.

@_date: 2013-11-17 05:36:38
The address you give out to people is your public address. 
However there is always a private address associated with the public address (that you should always keep secret - in fact you have to go out of your way to even uncover it most of the time). 
You can derive the public key from the private key with simple maths operations in miliseconds.
However you cannot go from a public key to a private key: In a round-about way the OP's chart tries to demonstrate the difficulty in doing this. This is one of the fundamental concepts of cryptography and also bitcoin since it inherently heavily relies on it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:38:20
The private key is the hidden cryptographic secret that 'unlocks' access to any bitcoins that any specific bitcoin address may have.
If the private key is known by someone, then they have access to those bitcoins. This is why you never share the private key, only the public key, which can be derived easily from the private key thanks to a relatively simple and computationally easy set of mathematical operations.

A powered hub is at risk of damage to the attached devices because most come with power adapters (wall adapter, power pigs - call them what you will) of questionable quality.
So if you had 10 block erupters on a 10 port hub you are risking $1000+ of hardware on a $2 to $5 Chinese made power adapter that could blow up and surge your hardware at any moment. There are some good youtube videos where electronics experts pull apart these kinds of adapters and point out their flaws. In fact I bet many of the geek types (myself included) who are interested in mining have had many power adapters fail over the years. Usually it's poor quality components or overheating components that are not cooled adequately, or just poor design in general.
A safer alternative is to run the hub from a high quality computer power supply, this means breaking out a soldering iron and some heatshrink insulation and cutting up a molex power cable of some kind.
If you are running a lot of hubs that are drawing substantial power, then this will also save you a (small, relatively) amount of electricity because the conversion efficiency of computer PSU are as high as 92% but I think you'd be lucky to get 50% or more from a cheap Chinese made wall power adapter.

Block erupter USB's are one of a very few number of devices that use ASIC technology that you can order TODAY and have the item posted to you on the same day, without pre-order, or huge delays. This is especially true for hardware where 1 unit costs &lt;$1000 USD each.
* Avalon: Good luck with that (in very high demand, high unit costs)
* BFL direct 'order': Enjoy your delays: 
* BFL in hand from ebay: Enjoy the 10x price inflation (You want a jally? That'll be almost $3000 thanks)
* KnC: No products shipped / still in development
* TerraHash: No products shipped / still in development
I don't know of any other projects that are shipping working ASIC devices today.
Block erupters from the point of view of ASICMiner business model is a very cleaver product, even from a manufacturing point of view it is smart because every single ASIC chip needs to have all the rest of the device built around it to run, ie. not a shared board (lower costs) with many chips. This makes the customer pay lots of a single chip device... clever. Good on them.

What do you mean by 'real-world'? Are you one of those people who think a 'real-world' development is only one that results in a product you can buy and hold in your hands?
Pushing the limits of cryptography IS real-world. It drives the development of new technology that secures our information and digital assets. It's better to actively explore these issues (vulnerabilities) instead of pushing them under the carpet - pretending they dont exist - and then waiting for chaos to ensue if someone ever cracks it in years to come. If primes can be used to break encryption, the outcome at the end of the day will be new interest in developing more resistant forms of cryptography while the vulnerable forms are phased out.
Out of curiosity: 
* Would you consider a faster mobile phone data technology to be real-world?
* Is a more efficient combustion engine also real-world?
* Is evolution real-world?
If you answer yes to any of those, how could you also argue that cryptography is not real-world? It is important in so many aspects of our lives today, especially in this digital age we find ourselves living in.

I mine solo on one of those other currencies. I'd prefer to not say which one. It's better for me than mining BTC directly, or using a pool. But it is still going to take a very long time to reach ROI, if ever. My current models predict ROI in 0.9 to 1.2 years, but I have not had the devices long enough to accurately predict it, and of course it's all up the air anyway because of difficulty increases which are hard to predict in the first place.
Also, if someone points a high GH/s ASIC at the altcoin (which has happened, although they seem to leave fairly quickly... yes it is that noticeable) then things become instantly far less profitable. For example on some of the SHA-256 altcoins, if someone pointed a 50 or 60 GH/s miner at it (eg avalon, BFL, AM blades) then it could immediately make my chances of reaching ROI impossible.

"The power regulator on this board is at 3 times its capactiy"
That is a real worry from a hardware longevity point of view. I can only assume it is also running at a temperature higher than it is rated. In graphics cards (radeons) the VRMs are a common source of failure, even though they are typically far underutilized, they suffer because they are insufficiently heat sinked, I hope BFL have taken this into account.
Also, I'd question whether that heatsink is rated to handle that much heat output from the whole board. It looks like a standard aftermarket CPU cooler, and those are seldom designed over 150 watts. They'd better get these power usage problems sorted before they start shipping, or, I suspect there will be a lot of grumpy customers once they get their hardware and it fails within a few days/weeks/months.
This is the culmination of months (years?) of pre orders and delays and pushbacks.

Even if your miner gets free power, it wont reach ROI anymore. You'll never get back what you paid for your miner. The only chance you have, is if you are playing the market game for a very long time, until BTC price increases by orders of magnitude. In which case, you would've been far better off just buying BTC with cash money directly.

The 'damage' would be momentary. Once those coins are diluted into the system, yes, the US would have some cash.

In addition to this, using the bitcoin-qt client is becoming a real drag. I still use it occasionally, and even on a relatively high end gaming machine it still takes far too long to sync the blockchain than is convenient or practical.

(PS: I know that bitcoin-qt has important behind-the-scenes uses and I fully support the efforts of the devs. But for regular users looking to do the occasional transaction, there are now far better options (and of course, this was reflected in the change of recommended client on the official site..).

The thing is, 2fa is not in the interests of the customer. 2fa only reduces the risk of theft which really only is a time inconvenience for most customers, unless the bank can show the customer was negligent in some way.
A customer who has their money stolen by almost any means will get it back if they make a case to the bank. That is the purpose of a bank. Banks are also really good at getting their customers and their own money back.
2fa is in the best interests of the bank and is not difficult technically to implement.

I ended up using CoinJar filler. Deposited the cash at a commonwealth bank. CoinJar confirmed the transaction after exactly 60 minutes and a few minutes later I had exchanged the AUD-&gt; BTC on their site, and then had BTC in my wallet right away (well, waiting for confirmations now...).
**I am very happy with this service and would definitely recommend it. At the time I did the transfer, bitstamp prices were about $84 USD/BTC and the CoinJar buy rate was at $95 AUD/BTC , MUCH lower than spendbitcoins which was $104 AUD/BTC.**

How many eBay/paypal transactions as a buyer have you gone through? I suspect not many ( &lt;100 ). I have done close to 400 now and I have several problems with them as a buyer, including their outragious errors and site bugs that occur when your account goes negative (even by $0.01). Then, the only way to increase your balance back to positive (even if its in the  red by just that $0.01) is to a do a bank transfer. These take DAYS. Your account essentially can't be used during this time. 
This is just one of several examples.
Why not just go to one of the many paypal hate sites around the web for more examples?

Given how hard is for miners right now, in the long term it is reasonable to assume the price per BTC will increase, perhaps a lot.

The width of the 'whole universe' cannot be definitively known. So only the observable universe can be measured. 
It would be possible to model the big bang to come up with an estimate. However the damned things about models is that there is no such thing as a perfect model and so there is never definitive assurance the estimate you get represents reality.
You could philosophically argue that the 'real size' of the universe is irrelevant because only what can be observed is important. Indeed, anything outside of the observable universe is irrelevant to us in any case.

I have mined PPC before and the thing about alt coins is that you can't use them to buy things like you do with bitcoins so once they are mined most people will just exchange them for BTC. The result is obvious in that their overall value hovers around that of BTC. 
If you are taking note of things like luck and other market factors on a day to day basis then you will see that some days it is better to mine them and others it is worse. In the end though the difference between mining PPC and BTC on a good pool will be very little.

As if anyone who deals with XPM (primecoin) doesn't know about it. Their XPM trade volume is ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE higher than any other exchanges that offer XPM. 
mcxNOW is a good website and I use it, but it's not really 'new' (its been around for months now, just like primecoin). Everyone has an opinion on mcxFEE but its going to have much poorer returns than if you are good at trading and investing in coins.

On the timescales which BFL operates, as demonstrated countless times, i.e. repeated and regular delays of 2+ weeks, it could easily be months or next year until you get any hardware.
The problem with this is of course that their whole company could fall apart, or some kind of other disaster, in which case they have your money and you have no product. You and others could go after your money with the aid of expensive lawyers but if you are just buying a jalapeno or two you are not going to be one of those people who can afford to hire representation for any legal action.
And for those BFL supporters here who would call out my post: Just remember that a company must be judged on its actions and not its promises. So far we've seen a lot of promises and a few units shipped to tech journalist types and various 'non-consumer' entities.

I don't agree. As a miner in country with expensive electricity rates (Australia, $0.26+/kWh) the conversion rate is important to many of us 'still' using GPU's to mine. I know you all love to hop on the ASIC bandwagon in this subreddit, but you must realise that the vast majority of miners are still using GPU and thus are still close to the threshold where mining costs more electricity than can be recouped from selling BTC.
Now I know that there are a lot of idealistic people in this subreddit who think 100% of miners mine because they want to improve the security of the network, but the fact of the matter is that many casual miners still have a power bill to pay every month or quarter and the conversion rate *is* important to us (the majority).

This is not going to work. It is sort-of against their terms.
They added the CC/paypal feature to 'tip' users videos because creators wanted some return on vimeo: they could go to youtube and get arguably simmilar features and tonnes of ad revenue by monetizing their videos.
Unfortunantly, not all of the 'tip' goes to the creator, vimeo takes their cut for providing the service for the video creator.
So no, you cannot ask for direct payments to paypal address you own, or bitcoin for that matter, because you are bypassing vimeo's chance to make money from you, and they don't like that.

Your first three questions are kind of hard to get into technical answers when we see your final question. I suggest you have a read about bitcoin mining in general on the bitcoin wiki and also over at bitcointalk, where there is far more information than you will casually find in discussion here on reddit. There are whole mining, mining hardware, mining software sub-forums at bitcointalk.

Fair enough. That is still a lot of blocks. Google's huge pile of CPU's might be huge but I have single graphics cards that hash at rates equivalent to hundreds of quad core CPU's.
Perhaps someone has estimated google's processing power before, but from what I know they are not particularly open with that kind of information.
Even if they could claim 90% of the 2016 blocks then they'd only have made enough money to pay a fraction of their daily datacenter power bills.

I've spent better part of a decade studying science at my university, I can tell you are coming at this from an external perspective. Its true that a lot of it kept for investments and also used in jewelry. But to say that gold based catalysis is used in comparable quantities to "gold foil in satellites, UV filters for astronaut helmets" with no quantitative understanding of the situation is absurd.
If you wanted to know why gold is worth so much, despite its small use and seeming overproduction, then all you had to do was spend 30 seconds googling it: 
How this comes back to OPs pics, I have no fucking clue. might be needed for that.

You gave up the right to access to your coins the moment you sent the funds to Mt Gox. When you use an exchange you are putting your trust 100% in them for the period of time the funds are in their control.
Obviously the only way you can get your funds back is to verify. Telling us about it wont fix the problem: we don't control Gox and thus neither your funds.

They probably had an approved merchant account, or whatever paypal calls their high-tier account types. This way paypal expects high volume / high value transactions and they assess the risk of that account differently.

I did this today, with $100, at a Commonwealth bank (which is their account holder, so it is faster to deposit at a Commonwealth branch to avoid delays eg. depositing cash at another bank would've taken 1-2 business days). 
The process on the banks side appears to be completely anonymous.
I suppose that by walking into the bank and being recorded by their surveillance cameras you are not completely 'anonymous' but it's not like I had to give any ID or anything like that.
On the receipt it says the "Depositors name" is just the reference number they gave me.

You spent ~$27,500 USD on something that you don't understand well enough to protect?
The sensible thing would have been to buy 1, and then play around with it, test various ways of protecting your small investment and learn the ins and outs of bitcoin. While your coins are in Gox they could easily be stolen from a hacker or from a exploitation of your devices you are using to connect to the exchange. They could abruptly close down, and run away with your $27,500 investment.
You are a bad person. Tsk. Tsk.

This is fail talk because if you look at other countries you'll see huge spikes in the center of them, even in places like in the middle of Australia where essentially nobody lives.
The map is placing the marker intensity as really high in the center of countries when it doesn't have correct GEOIP data.
I think it is just coincidence that where BFL operates from is approximately where the map thinks the center of the country should be and hence where the marker is shown.

Nope. This is a fallacy. It will eventually attain a steady rate of *increase*. 
Over periods of time, mining hardware will continue to become outdated and obsolete. You can draw countless comparisons to other PC components in this respect.
Specifically (mathematically), you are confusing increases in a rate of change with increases in an absolute value.

Smaller fab size often means lower power consumption / better thermal properties too. So you can push out more cycles per second and hence the hashing power can be greatly enhanced.

Never, because their argument is timeless: it holds an endless and impossible burden of proof.
The same thing is seen with some scientific 'debate' (especially as politics becomes involved in an issue), and especially when discussing theism vs atheism.
For example: 
Mobile (cell) phones cause cancer.
God exists, but just hasn't appeared before us (yet).
Both these arguments have no evidence to suggest they they are true. However no evidence can be provided that proves they're otherwise false. You can only sit back and note the (ever growing) distinct lack of evidence demonstrating any truth in these statements. But this alone will always be disregarded by the denialist(s)/skeptic(s).

Apparently not the 5750 which I was using for scrypt mining last night. It doesn't have any RAM heatsinks. I wondered what the burning smell was coming from (I thought one of my heftier cards might be melting a PCIe power cable...) and found the RAM chips on the back of the card were about 150 deg C with my IR temperature probe.
Back to SHA-256 with it!

The difference is simple. With decimal fiat currency you are limited to (almost in all cases) 1 cent, which is a hundredth of the base unit.
However, if you start dealing with milli, even micro and smaller units then you are greatly increase the orders of magnitude we are looking at. We've gone from 2 orders of magnitude to 6. 
People get confused doing it in their head. We see it every semester in our classes. It is a problem from a teaching perspective, despite its fundamental simplicity.

Important superpower X makes bitcoin trading illegal. [Banks close accounts at mere hint of bitcoin related activity]( Exchange website servers in countries where the laws are in effect are shut down. [Citizens are outraged as exchange operators in foreign countries are extradited to superpower X to be made example of, and thanks to superpower X's hints at the damage it could cause by limiting trade to pro-bitcoin nations, those nations goverments do not really put up a fight]( Meanwhile, governments of countries without such legislation share their outrage, EU for example deplores the incident. Protests take place within superpower X and also in other nations, [which only increases awareness of the seemingly new currency]( Global adoption of bitcoin surges whilst superpower X lags behind economically, held back by its own strict legislation and claiming its traditional-currency dependent economy is and always will be vastly superior.

Its probably not the chips making the whine, but the chokes (also called inductors, depending on where you live), which form part of the power circuit (sometimes called a 'phase': which is a group of electrical components that work to regulate power).
There's usually very little you can do about, and it can be entirely random if it happens to you or not. I've had graphics cards of the same model where some had it really bad (could be heard from many rooms away) and others that were silent.
Although there are probably some electrical engineers here that know more about this problem than me, I don't believe it is a sign that anything is wrong or that it might fail. Given your probably going to make heaps of money with that unit, I wouldn't mind ;)

Which is why a good encryption system will take entropy from a second source, and combine it with its internal RNGs. For example, the "move your mouse pointer as much as possible" stage of creating a TrueCrypt volume is probably the most well known example that comes to mind.

So understated. If you dont do this, you could easily screw up your funds.
Instead, do more or less what OP describes, but use electrum client and instead of backing up to a paper wallet, back up your seed phrase. This way you can recover from that seed phrase, and it will still manage things like change addresses for you.
Also, paper burns nicely, so if you have a housefire then you can still lose all your BTC. "Fire resistant" safes are not fire-invulnerable, either. You should think about other ways of securing this information and/or have multiple secure backups offsite. I could talk about this stuff for pages of text...

Well if you had a 2400 watt kettle and used it for 5 minutes it would've used about 720 kJ of energy for that one use.
If you ran a single USB miner for a whole day, it would use at least 216 kJ per day.
So if you use your kettle less than once every three days... the miner is actually using more power.

Great info, definitely needed for the newbies trying to dive into this tech and flooding this subreddit. It has taken me months to fully grasp mining / theory / practical use of bitcoin and I would never claim to be an expert at these things. I started mining in early 2011. Additionally things change so fast it can be hard to keep track of what is happening sometimes.
Some thoughts:
* I am surprised to see bitcointalk forums are not mentioned. I realise that it has its own problems, isn't part of reddit, and noobs could get scammed in the newbie subforum, but at the same time it provides a wealth of information and support that reddit cannot. On the other hand, researching bitcoin as a noob invariably leads to this forum because of its prominence. Likewise with the dedicated altcoin forums.


* Wait, the mods want us to report reposts? Really? Isn't that what downvotes are for? If I reported all content I saw on reddit that I know is a repost, the mods/admins of reddit would've banned me countless times for annoying them (6 year old account). Most of the frontpage of reddit and is a repost cesspool to me.
* The bitcoin wiki and specifically the FAQ (  ) provides a volume of information that covers MANY of the noob questions that come up and are downvoted. For example "What backs bitcoin". "How do I mine". "Where can I get bitcoin". I have spent many a good hour perusing this site.
Lastly just wanted to say thanks to the mods of this sub for growing and keeping check of a such a rapidly spiraling community. You all do great work.

I think we'll have to agree to disagree, I believe that fundamentally reddit is a lot like a democracy and the upvote/downvote is just like an election. If the consensus indicates that a post or comment is poor quality or otherwise undesirable then it will be hidden or descend to the bottom of the comments page (assuming you've sorted by Best or Top comments). I realize that in many subreddits, especially the more popular ones, meme posts and image reaction posts or even comedy comments can be distracting from the serious discussion, but those types of posts are upvoted for a reason: because the majority of members liked it.
I personally don't like subreddits where I need to very carefully think if I am violating a rule or not, where in most other subreddits such rules would not exist. For this reason, I doubtfully will be participating in that sub again. This is surely no loss to you.
Best regards.

Mining altcoins with GPU remains profitable in many situations. I'd even say you are more likely to be able to attain some profitability with GPU compared to ASIC at the moment and going forward. However, the initial investment of both remains high, and ROI is only possible over long timescales.
