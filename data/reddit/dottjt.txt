I nderstand. What I'm arguing is that in a worst case scenario, and I'm talking worst case (Let's be honest, you only need to look at human history, to realise that conflict and complete collapse is a norm) bitcoins are worthless. 
There's a reason why gold has been money for thousands of years. It's because it's lasted through out all this conflict. I'm sure you'll claim that "Oh, something as drastic as WW2 could never happen again", but that's the kind of thing we've been saying since the beginning of time. 
But yeah, I'm not doubting the benefits. I simply don't trust a currency that doesn't have tangible value and I'm sure that bitcoins have a temporal use for some applications.

Here we go again. You're claiming something that's subjective. There's no such thing as "truth of reality", merely your own perception. Otherwise the human race wouldn't the irrational mess it is today. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:23:50
Fair point. The way I worded that was incorrect. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:22:13
I'm not justifying it. I'm merely stating the facts of the situation. If they can't manipulate it, they'll stay away from it and suppress it. That's the reality.

As I said, you get more from being aggressive. After all, most of your responses seem to have been driven by hate, rather than feeling compassionate towards me. 
Ben Bernanke is considered intelligent. I rest my case.
There's nothing wrong with refusing. I simply don't buy their arguments. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:16:54
The US dollar only as honest as the government. Bitcoins are only as honest as it's users. Gold is only as honest as the gold bar you're holding.
All can be interpreted in completely different ways. However I'll just state the facts and you can form your own interpretation as to which is most honest.

Not if you own physical.

This relates to the article that an earlier person suggested. 
@_date: 2012-10-23 01:06:45
I can't. I can only attempt at a rational thought. 
The idea of " the attempt" is an important distinction between stating a fact that may be 100%. 
I simply believe that your attempt is wrong. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:27:57
I was wrong. I was merely telling you why I was wrong. Is there any dishonor is explanation? 
@_date: 2012-10-23 01:21:48
That gold could be tungsten. What's with all this "admitting" and "claiming"? 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:21:10
Surely that's something that should be taken into account? They're a pretty big force you know :p
You can't say for sure, as I can't. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:04:45
I don't argue with your first two points. I agree to an extent. It's the fundamentals I disagree with, which I believe are always more important. The idea that it can be hacked. The same goes for paper money. It works, but it's poor fundamentals always lead to an eventually hyperinflation scenario, as history has showed us. 
As for success, I guess that's your own interpretation. If I can't use them to buy things at the store, there's just a novelty as gold and silver. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 12:14:43
I'm not too convinced by the answer. I believe with any amount of wording, you can support any argument, whether true or not. 
I see what he's trying to say, however yet again, everything is subjective and I may only exist as a thought in your head etc.  that sort of logic. 
@_date: 2012-10-23 01:07:21
Sure. It's a possibility.  
@_date: 2012-10-22 12:22:38
1. The problem with central banking is that there is NO SUCH THING as a secure store of value. Gold is the next best thing. It's the ultimate hedge (well, the actual items themselves are, food etc. if it ever gets that economicsally dire). The market does, whatever that may entail (seeing as how manipulated everything is by government). 
2. Yup. I'm a strong believer that the US dollar will hyper-inflate soon, however that's a completely different story :p
3. It's absurd to say that you don't make judgments on the future. We all do it to some extent, it's kinda the whole point to reasoning. Isn't it the whole point of rational thought?
4. Check out my response to tmanwebty on the honesty of a currency.
The US dollar is the world reserve currency and so it's the defacto everything. I'm just using it as the ultimate example.
@_date: 2012-10-22 12:12:43
By honest, I mean manipulated. The US dollar is easily manipulated because government are corrupt, not to mention the organisation of central banking. Leverage is the main culprit. 
Gold is honest because it's there. You can touch it, you can't manipulate it. Obviously you can use leverage etc. however one gold bar will always be one gold bar in a tangible sense. 
Bitcoins are dishonest in a different way. It's the idea that because it's digital, it can be manipulated or hacked. I'm not saying that it's easily or practical, however it's the possibility that counts. The idea that the system can be distorted, simply because it is digital. That's my basic argument. 
You're right in that value is merely perception. However thousands of years of history (i.e. gold) is a better persuader than the market when things go wrong. Even with that said, gold is still highly valued as you can see by the price. 
I'm not saying they're not useful. As I said, they're merely a novelty. No one caries around silver coins with them anymore. Hence, limited function. What's the point in Bitcoins if you can't go down to the shops to buys things with them? As you said, I'm sure they have some use.
I'm basically saying that Bitcoins will never really take off on a mainstream level, which is something you're not denying. I guess we have two different ideas of success.

haha classic reddit.
1. Subjective theory. Let us go around in circles.
2. If the government told you that they were to kill you for using bitcoins (let's not forget that every transaction is visible), would you not oblige? 
3. This one is simply hilarious. Do you honestly think America would be where it is today, if it weren't for the exploitation of the cheap labor of other countries? The fact that you omit any form of corruption is simply disgusting, be legalized or accepted.

- I'll read it.
- I would say that the FED are only printing all this money to take full advantage of globalization, hence the deficits etc. They know it's not sustainable, but it was never about the future. By the same token, my sentiment still stands. 
- I'm sure it's not a prerequisite, however it certainly helps and is usually the main reason behind any mainstream change. Humans are irrational and we have a strong history of war and violence. 
- It is young, however these are merely my predictions, based upon my arguments and the history of bitcoins thus far.

Here's just a small example why I disagree. He says that corporeal and incorporeal are equal, but I don't buy that. For example, you only need to look at digital distribution via torrents, to realize that music in a both forms are treated radically different by the user. The perception of something that is tangible, is radically different to something that is virtual.

I don't have a position. I'm not here to argue. I'm here to discuss and form my own opinion.
I take an agressive approach because you illicit more from your fellow man. In a sense, I'm challenging your beliefs, not my own. 
I'm willing to admitt that I'm flawed, however that was never my main intention coming into this. I'm here to fix any of my misconceptions that I may of had in the past. 
This is the problem with you. You think I have some sort of agenda. I'm just here to learn and I'm here to admit that I don't know everything. 
So let me get this straight. You're having a go at me for agreeing with what you're saying? 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:23:30
Nothing's truly good. Everything has bad qualities, as they do good qualities. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 12:48:43
My point exactly. 
I lose either way. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:26:54
1. Saying something's not, doesn't make it so. You're really just wasting both our time here. Either tell me why, or don't say anything at all. 
2. You didn't answer my question. 
3. I just demonstrated why globalization works. Not why American businessmen are inherently better at producing things. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:01:32
I never denied that. However it's the aspect of honest that counts at the end of the day. If the system were to collapse, then at least there would be some amount of integrity.
Before the US went off the metals standard in the early 1970's, there was a certain level of integrity. Now it's just print, print, print.  
I don't believe in paper money, any more than I do bitcoins. Bitcoins are harder to manipulate, but not completely infallible - which I'm sure was said about paper money at the time. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 11:32:55
1. How is gold bad? The most important factor for a currency, is that it should be honest. You can do that by making it secure, which is impossible, or you can assign the currency some sort of base value. The fact is, there is no perfect currency. You also don't need to use gold. You can easily use silver instead, or even use a basket of commodities to lessen the volatility. But the 'honesty' aspect is a must. Something which Bitcoins technically lack. 
2. Fear drives most things. If money drives towards value, then why on earth is oil traded in U.S. dollars? Cmon, you can't be that one dimensional?
3. What I'm claiming is that those with the biggest gun, have control at the end of the day. If the government threatened you with death for engaging with bitcoins, do you think people would still use it?
4. I'm not doubting the benefits. All I ask is to consider the down-sides, which I believe to outweight the positives. Refer to point 1. 
Bitcoins will never kick off BECAUSE of government. At what point will the government allow you to pay taxes with bitcoins? They'll never let it happen. Without complete integration, bitcoins serve as a novelty compared to other currencies.

Agreed. However you're ignoring the point. I'm Comparing the US dollar to the bitcoin. Not merely the case of the Ruble as itself. If the world were to turn to shit, reiterate THE WORLD, I doubt people would flock to the bitcoin as opposed to the US dollar. Even then, people would go to gold regardless. 
@_date: 2012-10-22 23:30:12
What I mean is that anything can be manipulated to suit your purpose. Words inclusive. 
I'm inarticulate. Blame me, not my arguments.
