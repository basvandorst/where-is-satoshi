@_date: 2018-01-23 12:03:26
There is no such thing as a public key 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:12:43
You said "in"!
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:10:23
When I first got in I bought at the top right before correction and I didn't whine as much as these people this time 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:38:24
Why is everything directed towards investors? What about those of us with zero intent of conversion to fiat? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:52:28
Lol what 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:10:26
Read some Murray Rothbard or Ludwig van Mises, or Lysander Spooner. Or stay in the bubble. Do what you want. But there are better ideas out there.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:14:11
Don't invest. Adopt. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:03
Speculators expecting to get rich quick are freaking out. This was never proposed as a get rich quick scheme and I have no pity right now for those going back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-13 11:05:09
Never gonna sell. This is going to eventually be a world currency or its not. Just going to be patient

Crashing? One bitcoin is still worth one bitcoin. I don't get the panic personally.

I don't know I'm just a history student. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:43:14
So what exactly? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:58:56
What about those of us who care almost zero for the fiat conversion rate? I checked my wallet. Guess what? A bitcoin is still worth a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:48:12
Anything is possible with a hard fork 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:28:09

I don't even care about volatility. Whatever. If it's cheap, buy more, if it's not, buy more. Life is simple. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:37:40

@_date: 2018-01-30 20:38:06
Then you haven't tried hard enough. Do you agree there is a problem or no? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:43:33
If you don't see the problem then I'm sorry to say... You're the problem. :(
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:31:45
Well there are some philosophers for you. If you don't realize there's a problem though then you won't care for the solutions though. And I'm pretty sure you don't see forced confiscation of wealth by threat of violence and incarceration as a problem which is sad. The Kool aid is strong.

@_date: 2018-01-23 15:39:21
ill only care when the volatility (which is measured by fiat, for now) stabilizes. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:25:29
Thanks for the laugh. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:53:24

@_date: 2018-01-11 11:40:22
Absolutely not.  we need a decentralized exchange.

There is no such thing as a public key. There is a public ADDRESS. and then a PRIVATE KEY. you give the address to those who can use it to send money to you. You use the PRIVATE KEY to send money to others. Since it's A PRIVATE KEY, if anyone but you knows it then they can take your funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:52:19
Oh fuck. Sell sell
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:53:25
You don't understand how proof of work makes bitcoin exist or gives it value. You don't understand the tech, the purpose, or the necessity of this revolution. You either haven't tried, you are too lazy to actually think, or you're too stupid. So you tell me, big guy.

@_date: 2018-01-01 14:53:23
not before me!
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:25:54
It's not a grammar thing. There was a false statement. Bitcoins don't go in the trezor.  I corrected it for newbies and others.
@_date: 2019-07-09 23:26:43
just do a little bit at a time every week. better for sanity and less risky than just going in as one big buy.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:46:08
healthy correction to the 50-day moving average. not a big deal... 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:13:51
Why? You converted into bitcoin at that rate but the amount you got in exchange won't change.
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:51:33
You're gaslighting me right? You can't be serious.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:22:34

You need to realize the trezor device is nothing more than a short cut to your private key. You still have your private key on the side incase the hardware itself is compromised 
@_date: 2019-07-24 01:10:24
You've been in the space for years...and you didn't spend a few minutes to educate yourself on the bare bone basics of Bitcoin. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:01:34
better question is what situation that you think could happen would make it so you couldnt? Bitcoin has no borders. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:32:57

put some cash into cashapp, and then every friday use the cash already deposited to convert to bitcoin. That works well enough, I think. For example, you could put in $500 into cashapp, and then convert $50 every week into btc.

@_date: 2019-07-22 13:27:16
they can say that, that's not really a bitcoin ban though. bitcoin can't be banned. why would anyone think that as an incentive to liquidate bitcoin into paper? Seriously, I am sure some idiots would do that but  any attack government or otherwise on the bitcoin system is good for bitcoin, because it will survive, press on, and prove to the world why it exists. I say bring it.

Well, everyone is different. Me? I use cashapp  for buying, and then I use wasabi wallet to anonymize, then I use a hardware wallet,  a trezor, for cold storage. I use [cointracking.info]( to keep track of my dollar cost averaging. For the easiest, you can cut it down to simply cashapp --&gt; hardware wallet (Trezor or ledger), and you can hold on there. If you are looking for an actual trading platform, Kraken is probably the most friendly. Coinbase cannot be trusted and  I don't like Gemini. If you want to be fully anonymous then there is a peer to peer trading platform called bisq that does not use kyc/aml although the liquidity is low. I am assuming you are American, by the way.

@_date: 2019-07-12 14:32:26
Uhh wrong. I'd rather spend fiat than bitcoin because the value of fiat is dropping, while the value of bitcoin is appreciating. Spending an appreciating asset is not smart.

in my mind when i imagined this, if and only if fiat is still a measuring device, it would get the btc price at clock in, and when you clock out it gets the price at clock out, adds those prices together, divide by 2, and multiply by hours worked bam. fair pay for fair work.

the real problem is there is no competition because startups are pinned down by regulation and bandwidth monopolization. how about we solve that problem instead of being lazy and just giving absolute control to the government which time and time again has proven to be completely incompetent and wasteful with the most basic of tasks. Let's solve the real problems. Running to mommy government does not solve the root problem, and not only does it not solve the root problem, it creates much worse problems.

I am assuming people are diversifying. I own a bit of a bunch of different cryptos. Going all in on just bitcoin is kind of nuts. Even I am not willing to go that far. I absolutely will never own bitcoin cash though or any bitcoin fork. If there is going to be  a bitcoin competitor it will be monero I believe. Bitcoin forks are alt coins whose initiators do not have confidence in starting their own crypto so I will never ever own a bitcoin fork coin.

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:58:03
they are pitiful because they whine and complain and FUD to make themselves feel better because deep down they are pissed off they didnt get in when it was easier. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:42:36
I don't understand why people are so stressed out about this. For every Short there is a Long, and it's cash settled. Bitcoin is global. It's not a big deal other than its becoming more mainstream. That's all that's going on. Relax. Let the gamblers gamble. Meanwhile, buy and hodl and wait for lightning network.

haha christmas cashout, i mean i get it. hopefully next year we can just spend our btc on christmas stuff instead of having to convert back to fiat.

That's so disingenuous and wrong. NN gives complete centralized authority of the internet to the federal government. Fuck that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:24:55
one bitcoin can be broken down into 100,000,000 pieces. this is called being fungible. the supply is fine. someday the value of a bitcoin will stabilize. also second layer scaling will be mainstream at that point. at this point bitcoin will be instant, with very minimum fees, and a stable means of exchange. expect this in a few years or more. until then, accumulate and be patient.

@_date: 2017-12-10 10:12:10
its a long-game. dont be short sighted. we have decades if needed. gives us more time to perfect layer 2 and layer 3 projects. Not a bad thing. Any event is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:09:21
What do you mean by invest exactly? Do you want to buy bitcoin?

I think scaling is a more pressing matter right now. So, in due time. Time enough for you to learn programming and help out. You know, because this is so important to you
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:42:26
You realize not every bitcoin holder on the planet goes to reddit right? You also realize scaling solutions are coming, right?
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:06:47
bitcoin crashes up. bitcoin needs to be $500,000 each to catch up to gold. we have a long way to go until stabilization which will be AT LEAST $500,000. still early. layer 2 solutions will rocket bitcoin up next year.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:26:43
first, take a chill pill. second, never ever ask us how much btc we have as individuals. that's just not accepted here. Third, Take another chill pill and then buy a hardware wallet. Also, this isnt a get rich quick scheme, you are buying into the future so wait for the future and chill. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:33:02
big scheme? This is still early. we dont even have lightning network yet. come on in the water is fine.

at that point you wont want to get rid of your bitcoin. thats the whole point of bitcoin.

Bitcoin lets me opt out of the system without violence. I am thankful for that. If the regulations get more intense on KYC/AML that should drive demand sky high. It will be good for bitcoin. The more bitcoin is isolated from the draconian financial system, the better.

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:50
still hell of a lot safer than traditional banks if you want to be safer. if you just want to spread your private keys everywhere then yeah a traditional bank will be safer. if you want to actually keep your keys safe, then crypto is safer.

anyone who has put any real thought into it knows its not a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:55:16
If you can't see the difference then you haven't studied enough. Bitcoin is a bubble just like the automobile bubble, the printing press bubble, the light bulb bubble, the clothes washer/dryer bubble, the microwave bubble, jeez I can go on and on. If you don't get that YET, then that's your own ignorance and no one elses. Bitcoin is not a corporation, it is not centralized, it is completely its own ecosystem that is self regulated by the code and the protocol. This is different than anything humanity has ever seen. Bitcoin is not a .com bubble, it is the protocol itself. No one heard of the TCP/IP bubble. You know why? Getting it yet? Stop listening to the old ignorant dinosaurs of the 20th century financial system and understand that this is the future and you're either going to hop on the ride, or you're going to be left behind without any pity.

the dollar is whats risky
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:08:22
of course i am still holding. Government fiat is in a very obvious  hyperinflationary bubble and I don't want to be holding any of that crap when it pops. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:41:03
what if i lost my wallet and my private key that i transferred it to?
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:29:47
Don't sell. Just chill out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:51:08
Exactly. Bitcoins true value is based on its utility, both current and potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:54:51
there are over 100 developers busting their ass for lightning. Just have to accumulate and be patient. It will pay off!

it already corrected a couple days ago. where were you? How arrogant are you to think that you, a random internet nobody, can tell the community when and what they should do with their property? Sheesh. Get over yourself or go to . 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:48:08
Yes. It is called scaling and is a top priority for the open source developers. The issue is to improve scaling without giving miners more power (as bitcoin cash has done (ie big blocks)) with 2nd layer solutions such as lightning.network(yes that is a website, check it out). Feel free to start your own full node and help out if you are so inclined. Segwit is a preliminary measure to help scaling, but more has to be done. Thankfully, it is being worked on. Expect 2018 to be a very big year. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:16:10
...which will allow entrepreneurs to fill the vacuum of service and take some of the market share away from the big ISPs. So what's the problem with the free market again and how is government control better than the free market? This is the bitcoin sub for cripes sakes how anyone that enjoys the benefits of a decentralized monetary asset and is PRO government control of the internet is beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:13:32

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:51
doesnt require a fork. on your wallet there will be an "open channel" option. you do this with whoever you want to transact with. this will create an off chain ledger that you will manage on your wallet for however long until either party decides to upload the ledger to the blockchain to be processed. It will be very easy when its ready.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:56:44
at that point im moving to a free country. I will never live in this nightmare.

ive actually tested it a bit on one of my nodes. what do you want to know about it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:48:16
how can you question its value? If you dont think a decentralized, inclusive, instant means to store and transfer wealth without any 3rd party is valuable, then you never will. go back to your hyperinflation and have fun.

Huh? It's easier in a lot of ways.

EXACTLY. So lets solve THAT problem instead!!! That's the real problem!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:37:22
Okay. But that can be prevented and the blockchain can be protected in advance of that. Furthermore, won't other very important networks be compromised if quantum computing becomes a thing? nuclear ICBMs, etc? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:56:34
with hyperinflation anything is possible

price of an asset is simply the market price of that asset. It is the price at which an investor/buyer is willing to purchase an asset in an arm’s length transaction given that full information about the asset is available to that said investor/buyer.
Value of an asset is a fair assessment of the future cash flows an asset can be expected to generate after deducting all investments and expenses and then trying to put a price on those cash flows today. There are various methods for calculating the value of an asset

I don't have the slightest idea where the disconnect is for you. It's in development, testing has been done on the live network, and succeeded. Development and testing continues, but progress is being made. Why are you so hung up on today? Are you really this incredibly retarded? When email first came out you couldnt send attachments. When automobiles came out, there werent many paved roads.

I am torn on this. On one end, yes the ISPs being forced to provide open access to the internet sounds great. On the other hand, government control over what the ISPs can and cannot allow is scary. I would opt for instead of focusing on NN, we focus on how we can help ISP startups compete in a free market with the big boys, especially in rural areas. Because of this, I am anti-NN.

@_date: 2017-12-09 10:18:21


The whitepaper explains that the currency aspect is the third and final stage of the bitcoin plan. Bottom line is it is a messaging app first, a store of value 2nd, and a currency 3rd. Lightning network will absolutely blow the lid off of bitcoin...when it finally becomes the currency it is meant to be. By then those without any bitcoin will be left behind. No one says snapchat is in a bubble when they have 100,000 new users in a day. Right? You really have to open your mind a bit. I know it's hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:41:53

@_date: 2018-09-25 16:03:40
Right because centralized institutions never get hacked right? You are leading these poor people into a trap spurned by the acceptance of ignorance. This is a dangerous road. I respect peoples intelligence more than you. This is UNSAFE. I would take nocoiner over custodial any day! Custodial institutions getting hacked would hurt the ecosystem. Nocoiners continuing to nocoin doesn't. Give me a break. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:08:17

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:13:44

@_date: 2017-12-04 11:24:10
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:09
And then the community decided that lightning network would be better as block size increases put up road blocks to users and centralizes power with miners. Next. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:00:09
Huh? Verizon and ATT are the least of my worries. If NN stays in play the government could shut the exchanges down. NN is dangerous for freedom and markets and competition. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:19:54

Um...everything you said about "republicans" can be equally applied to "democrats" You do realize Obama killed more civilians with drone strikes across at least 7 countries than any other president by far, right? The entire political system is a sham and a way to pit people against each other. dont fall for it. They are all the same.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:03:16

bitcoin is the blockchain. every other altcoin is built on 98% of bitcoin's protocols. they have their own blockchain, but that blockchain came from bitcoin's design to begin with. to say bitcoin and blockchain are different is extremely ignorant. the entire crypto sphere relies on bitcoin's success to be successful in kind.

My guess is between  $3-5million as the exchange rate. at that point no one will want to exchange bitcoin for fiat anymore though and it will be globally recognized.

good thinkg bitcoin isnt an investment. its a new global asset class that can be exchanged instantly peer to peer. This isnt a bubble. Even if it was, its still better than hyperinflationary fiat garbage.

You did this to yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:04:52
Yes. Micro payments will be viable. They have tested this in the live environment. The lightning network works and nodes are ready to implement it.

When I convert my dollar into EUR when I go overseas I don't say I am "investing in the euro." That sounds ridiculous.  Same goes for bitcoin.

If I tell my brother I will give him 50 warcraft gold to clean my room, then what? Also, warcraft gold has a $ conversion rate if you want to sell it (against the TOS but that's beside the point).

yeah basically. but i hate banks so i like to think of them shitting their pants.

if you put your private keys on a usb and it gets stolen then thats your own stupid ass fault. 
edit: Listen, crypto is only as safe as you want it to be. You can never take my keys. It's literally impossible. Unless you can hack my brain. That is the most secure bank in the world. My own brain. And you want to do a $5 wrench attack? Then do it. I have a hidden wallet with a dummy amount in it as well. This is security. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:34:05

wrong answer. no one cares how TCP/IP works. they only care that it works. bitcoin should be the same way. theres no reason for non technical people to care about TCP/IP and it goes the same way here.

amazon, netflix, the internet, the printing press, electricity, automobiles etc. were technological innovations and disruptions to existing markets and paradigms. Bitcoin belongs on that list.

the internet was hard to understand in 1994 too. and yet, here we are.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:18:47
ehhh...should just buy and hodl like the rest of us...unless you have at least 100k laying around and cheap electricity
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:43:53
the internet is kinda crappy when it is only the first layer too. calm your tits and accumulate, its still early. layer 2 and layer 3 will be awesome and youll be happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:28:51
no no. you can come back. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:20
predict the price? I dont understand. one bitcoin is one bitcoin.

maybe not at the moment, but if the case is made in a convincing manner, the fork could succeed. all forks up until this point has had kind of a "fuck you" mentality towards the main chain.

womanipulation imo 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:02:23
of course exchanges can't be fully trusted either. which is why you get your own wallet in the first place. come on. stop with the strawman shit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:27:05
i have both a trezor and nano ledger. both are fantastic, although i slightly prefer trezor more. i use electrum wallet if i want to spend any, but thats rare with the current volatility. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:27:29
never cashing out. this is the money of the future. The dollar is too risky. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:57
we are holding waiting for it to stabilize(my prediction is around $500k or so), when it does we will use it as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:44
oooooooooookay. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:18
its a satoshi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:56:16
100% until +/- 5% stability although gh thinking of adopting some monero as a hedge against privacy concerns
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:26:00
tullips can be endlessly grown. how do you think bitcoins are created? Seriously, you are just a salty twat who wishes he got in early on this revolution. get out of here. when the printing press bubble bursts let me know. also this, for your stupid ass: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:15:40
getting lightning network setup during a bear market in 2018 would be really good for bitcoin imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:19:26
IF NEEDED. We won't need it, but if we do, we as a community will keep working on the project with or without mainstream. If necessary. That is probably worst case scenario, but it is one most of us accept as a possibility, sure. Lightning network or a different 2nd layer solution should have been in the ecosystem early this year. If it was, bitcoin would likely have a $50,000 evalutaion. The only thing holding it back is scaling, which will be taken care of in due time. In the meantime, it's gold 2.0 and wall street, the banks, and world governments can continue being ignorant, accepting the future, or fighting us. Whatever. Doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:00:51
Are you kidding me? You tell me why CENTRALIZING the internet is good for  DECENTRALIZED monetary system. Please. Go ahead.

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:06:55
soon enough. still in stage 2. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:08:33
we know. great. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:33:36
I fail to see how that's the case. the block size is bigger, the blockchain then will be bigger, thus will require more hard drive space, and also faster (in some places more expensive) internet to keep up with. This prices out those in developing countries from running their own full nodes and effectively only reserves full nodes to those who are already in the space. You are a liar. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:51:42
and they get on reddit and flood this sub with the most idiotic crap...the past couple weeks have been an influx of stupid on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:15:25
why would you buy without understanding the process first? Serious question. Also...bitcoin.com is a scam site. so I have no idea what you got yourself into.
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:52:15
What's an account? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:12:01
BCH is a scam because it thinks block size is the only issue when it comes to scaling. it ignores possible layer 2 and layer 3 solutions, and the bigger the blocks get, the more centralized it becomes. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:35:55
yeah man, when its that high there is no point in going back to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:52
im with you! But I will not let my greed take me over. I am going to ride the crypto revolution until complete victory or complete failure. Either way, I am proud to have been a part of it.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:43:54
people won't buy their product if their service is unsatisfactory. this is the free market. when a provider provides unsatisfactory service, they either adapt and start providing satisfactory service(driven by low sales and customer reviews, etc.) or newer players enter the space and compete, thus driving quality up. government centralization (AKA net neutrality) is the lazy way out..a "solution" thought up and supported by people that cant think past the age of 5. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:20:29
dont invest. adopt. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:11:16
Uh huh
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:10:12
Okay so why not focus on the reasons that startups can't compete? Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure that is the true issue and it's an issue that net neutrality does not solve.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:59:29
This would be awesome. It should roll out when lightning network enters 1.0
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:46:01
no,  its an inverted funnel system. get it right.

Anything to fud I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:12:10
Larger blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate.
Therefore, larger blocks lead to less hashers running full nodes, which leads to centralized entities(large mining operations) having more power, which makes Bitcoin require more trust, which weakens Bitcoins value proposition.
Bitcoin is only useful if it is decentralized because centralization requires trust. Bitcoins value proposition is trustlessness.
The larger the hash-rate a single miner controls, the more centralized Bitcoin becomes and the more trust using Bitcoin requires.
Running your own full node while mining rather than giving another entity the right to your hash-power decreases the hash-rate of large miners. Those who have hash-power are able to control their own hash power if and only if they run a full node.
Less individuals who control hash-power will run full nodes if running one becomes more expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:00:20

Yes because gox 2.0 can be trusted right

Actually these terms are well defined and very different. Capitalism means unimpeded voluntary commerce between consenting parties. Corporatism or crony capitalism means corporations use shady methods to use government to control the economy to pick winners and losers. Mostly they do this to create high barriers of entry to possible competition. Bitcoin is capitalism.
@_date: 2018-09-28 19:11:01
Not good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:19:59
The whitepaper explains that the currency aspect is the third and final stage of the bitcoin plan. Bottom line is it is a messaging app first, a store of value 2nd, and a currency 3rd. Lightning network will absolutely blow the lid off of bitcoin...when it finally becomes the currency it is meant to be. By then those without any bitcoin will be left behind. No one says snapchat is in a bubble when they have 100,000 new users in a day. Right? You really have to open your mind a bit. I know it's hard.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:57:40
IT LOOKS BAD? what about this?! 
Stop spreading false crap and START STUDYING. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:06:52
why does it matter? bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:07:24
Was electricity a bubble? Or, the printing press? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:31:31
heh, i wish i was lying. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:21:35
never going back to fiat. waiting until bitcoin becomes the currency it is meant to be. shouldnt be more than a couple years. a stabilization period of +/- 5% for 30 days should be a good sign of stabilization. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:08:25
good. more time to accumulate at a discount is fine with me. I dont understand all this "panic." Bitcoin isn't going anywhere but up, long-term. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:23:44
EASY PEASY

i also laughed. bcash has salesmen. BTC/LTC/ETH has engineers. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:49
I will be happy to. But first you tell me how electricity is not a bubble. Thanks.

yeah that never happened. thanks for playing though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:52:34
then sell. be a little bitch. if youre not in it to win it then whats the point
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:46:21
Oh man. Great comment. I actually have a ton of experience with poker and bankroll management(I live near vegas what do you expect lol).  Shit messes with your head. I know exactly what you mean. It takes a crazy amount of mental power to keep your cool during swings, but it is a skill that can be learned.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:11
Seriously this fud has to stop. Bitcoin won't be affected by a  few wealthy gamblers on wall street in the long term. Have some faith, boys. This is a GLOBAL revolution.

Great. More supply means more Satoshis for my dollar. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:57:05
They read FUD articles in the mainstream media with headlines similar to:  "THE WORLD WILL END BECAUSE BITCOIN WILL USE ALL THE ENERGY" its all nonsense. People regurgitate what media tells them is truth because they are unwilling, incapable, or just plain too brainwarped to go research for themselves. These people cannot be helped and should not be helped, as they will be the late-adoption type of person. No use having the conversation with them if they don't put in the slightest bit of effort to learn for themselves.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:26:50

yes but at least its open competition.

You think 500,000,000 is a lot in this space? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:25:25

Why don't you sell if there is something better? Get some monero. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:23
wouldnt change anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:55:53
Well bitcoin to me is mostly just my savings account that I am in control of. I can send to exchange, and convert back to fiat and deposit into my bank if I ever need it. Sure, capital gains, but whatever. Can handle it. Secondly, it is a deflationary item of value. This is a pretty big bonus, to be sure, but the primary reason I like bitcoin is that it lets me be my own savings bank. I am well into the gains, so it dipping thousands of bucks aint a real big deal to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:25
Because we are raised and programmed to obey authority, either legitimate or perceived. Here, this will help:

Use multiple addresses like the rest of us. What kind of insurance are you talking about? Bitcoin itself is already insurance against fiat so what are you talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:33:40
Common sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:29:49
Okay. So, explain it then because it was my understanding that this is common knowledge.

its a disruptive technology. that is the comparison presented. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:29:39
bcash is a scam coin. if anything is taking over btc it will be monero. but i dont think btc will be dethroned as the gold of crypto.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:37:34
this is an accurate comparison. finally. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:12:05
deposit USD first through gdax, wait a week, then you can convert to btc
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:07:48

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:22:41
blockchain.info was a good wallet in 2012 but is extremely archaic now. its better if you are looking to cold storage, a hardware wallet or paper wallet. if you are looking to actively spend/trade then a online wallet such as electrum is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:40:17
as someone who isnt ever going to trade fiat for bitcoin, one bitcoin will always be one bitcoin to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:40:04
was ethernet worthless before TCPIP? Yeah it kind of was. Relax. It's still the early early days.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:09:59
What drives the value? Bitcoin is the world's first borderless, trustless, instant, cheap, anonymous, secure, and deflationary means of wealth in the world. blockchain renders banks obsolete. The middle man is unnecessary now. With cryptocurrency, and bitcoin, you control your wealth. no one else.

If I see a 10% dip I usually go for it if I have some USD sitting in my gdax. I don't try to time it past that, I have been burned a few times though. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:18:47
a 20% correction would be $13,200. $13000 is now considered a discount. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:18:18
What are you comparing bitcoin to that makes you believe 9 years is a long time? It took nearly 50 years for credit cards to become mainstream, and it took centuries for paper money to become mainstream. You are just blowing raw stupidity out of your ass, and you should probably stop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:20:11
back in oct i was hoping for 7.5k for jan, but would be happy with 10k, so this dip means nothing to me...still quite interesting to watch the panic though. Just goes to show how many got in for the quick buck and not the tech.

Those examples are completely different to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:38:24
pretty sure its less than 1% but hey cool lets do it. by invested you mean acquired and own bitcoin right? with nonsense like bitcoinira and gbtc, just want to make sure you are meaning what you say.

2nd layer scaling solutions such as lightning.network is proving to be a promising  upgrade to the bitcoin system that will be rolling out on nodes near you! 
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:05:40
The world of logic? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:07
So wait, you chose hyperinflationary government fiat over real money? Okay. Get fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:33:13
As someone who keeps up with lightning network, 2017 has seen a huge spike in development power and testing. No one is ignorant here but you, pal. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:41
Anyone else kind of hoping for a bear market? A nice lull for a year to get lightning network up and going would probably be good for btc. not to mention accumulation time would be nice. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:26:07
i actually toss usd onto gdax and dollar cost average it out and slowly funnel the btc into my trezor.  not sure if thats the best idea but its been workin for past few months
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:32:20
okay use multiple wallets and move things around with different amounts, etc. . whoopdee do. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:04:33
and the smart people will buy the dip as is tradition. nothing will change.

NN in general does not solve the problem. That is my whole point. Come on, focus here. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:23:56
this concern was alleviated a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:53:21
is there somewhere that keeps track of sats/USD? I want to monitor that number more than USD/BTC
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:48:26
early adopters are almost always rewarded in technological revolutions. a revolution in currency is more-so. I say grats to everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:21:54
scaling will be fixed. we are accumulating in anticipation for the scaling solutions to go into the ecosystem. when that happens, it will be both. get your full nodes ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:33:24
big blocks give too much control to the big miners. I prefer 2nd layer solutions.

@_date: 2018-09-25 14:35:48
they wont thrive. Exchanges GET HACKED CONSTANTLY. How can you say that they will thrive? Give me a break. Having a single point of failure is asking for trouble. TRUSTING a profit driven entity with your property is asking for trouble. No. NO NO NO. What will it take for people to learn? This shit will explode in peoples faces that decide to trust them. It is inevitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:28:41
the stock market is going to implode and the dollar/euro/pound will lose a TON of value, peoples' 401ks will get decimated, and it might be so bad that the government will freeze bank accounts to stop people moving to other assets...this is going to happen a lot sooner than most realize i think.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:34:32
pretty sure we know this.

Good news

seriously though this bill is written by someone who doesn't have the slightest clue about cryptocurrency. It is written as if you have to have the money on your person to transport it. As we all are aware, this is not how it works.

It does have a lot to do with it. The 2017 run up was a marvel. Scaling solutions weren't ready. Segwit was embarrassingly not enough. We have a lot of new users but a bloated mempool... It's a valid criticism. If users dropped off, it would give devs time to get these issues fixed before the next run up. To clarify, I don't think users will drop. It's gold 2.0 until scaling is fixed, then it's good game.

Whatever, man. I believe that when lightning network goes mainstream its gameover. BTC will fulfil it's purpose.

I think if there is continuing government involvement, from the US and other countries, monero will be a top contender. I really am happy to have gotten into monero fairly early. If bitcoin is allowed to innovate the world financial structure as it can absolutely do, it will improve the lives of billions.

are you comparing bitcoin to garbage .coms in 1999? what are you smoking? Bitcoin and the tech under the hood is the equivalent if not more revolutionary than the invention of TCP/IP and other protocols.  When did the TCP/IP bubble pop?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:03
well, that's a true statement as well. I just don't think of bitcoin as having a fiat conversion anymore. bitcoin is its own thing. 1 btc is 1 btc. thats how it will be looked at in the future, so thats how im looking at it now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:45

Libertarian socialism is an oxymoron. I'm a studentt of Rothbard and Mises. Rothbard quote: If we are to keep the term "capitalism" at all, then, we must distinguish between "free-market capitalism" on the one hand, and "state capitalism" on the other. The two are as different as day and night in their nature and consequences. Free-market capitalism is a network of free and voluntary exchanges in which producers work, produce, and exchange their products for the products of others through prices voluntarily arrived at. State capitalism consists of one or more groups making use of the coercive apparatus of the government — the State — to accumulate capital for themselves by expropriating the production of others by force and violence.

It's not even minutely difficult to see the similarities. The internet didn't require people to change much? Huh. That's just incredible of a statement. I can't even. Bitcoin is the safest way to protect one's wealth. Bank assets can be frozen, shit did you already forget what happened in 2008? Banks can't be trusted. The world knows this.

What a lot of people leave out is that as price increases there will be fewer and fewer sellers. someday the only way to acquire Satoshis will be to earn it. Exchanges as we know it will die off as fiat becomes worthless.
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:58:37
Insured in USD right? You realize bitcoin is already insurance against fiat currency so to insure it in fiat is bonefide stupidity. Insure it in bitcoin or not at all. It's not win win when USD collapses and you can't get your bitcoin out.
@_date: 2018-09-21 03:30:16
Insured in dollars? See...this is what you and the wall street types don't understand. Bitcoin is its own insurance. It's insurance against a collapsing dollar. What kind of insurance is bakkt going to provide their customers  when the dollar implodes? What will they give their customers then? I don't think it will be the keys to their bitcoin will it? As I said, not your keys not your coins. Insuring bitcoin with dollars is like insuring gold with poodle shit. Custodial services are scams.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:36:52

I must be new? I know plenty of merchants that have it set up just like this. Most of them have moved to lightning which is even more  private. Don't even start with me kid. You wouldn't need 5000 keys to generate multiple addresses off of the same private key. I do this with my nano ledger CONSTANTLY. I have one key and like 50 addresses on it and growing. Even Andreas says never use an address more than once. I must be new. Jesus. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:15:29

Because by what you've said in this thread it gives the impression you're completely unaware of what bitcoin is other than a digital thing that has fiat value attached. I suggest study.

As I thought. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 18:11:36
price of an asset is simply the market price of that asset. It is the price at which an investor/buyer is willing to purchase an asset in an arm’s length transaction given that full information about the asset is available to that said investor/buyer.
Value of an asset is a fair assessment of the future cash flows an asset can be expected to generate after deducting all investments and expenses and then trying to put a price on those cash flows today. There are various methods for calculating the value of an asset

No. That's corporatism. Educate yourself.

I get the analogy in terms of technology growth, but the two protocols are extremely different and both are accomplishing different things, which is why I thought it was strange to compare as if TCP/IP was a currency protocol at its roots which is ridiculous(its an information protocol). Not saying that Bitcoin is in any way less important than TCP/IP, but they are totally different in purpose and code.

Again you're only talking about price. There's a reason the links to make a new topic on this sub explicitly say NOT about price. No one follows this rule but bitcoin is a technology first and foremost. Understanding this is what will give you the strength to hold through corrections and participate in educated discussions. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:30:16
I am talking specifically about modern leftists. Antifa is anarchist only as a means to their end of complete control over society with an iron fist. Ancaps and voluntaryists on the otherhand believe that property rights and individualism, as well as the non aggression principle as the ethical foundation of civilization is the most moral and peaceful way to conduct ourselves. No modern leftist if they were ideologically consistent with the movement would believe bitcoin to be anything other than a threat to their control over the individual which is either a\) completely antithetical to their core ideology of control over culture or b\) a way to crush the banks/monetary authority but only as a means to the end of complete control. They will only be pro\-bitcoin as long as bitcoin remains a way to bring down old power structures, but as soon as it fulfills that purpose, they will abandon it, while the libertarians/ancaps etc. continue to embrace it. As an ancap/voluntaryist for over a decade now I have read a lot of philosophy and listened to many people on these ideologies and topics. It is the way that a group acts that defines much more to their ideology than what they purport to believe. antifa is a prime case in this. the "leftist" anarchists.

They're both not trying to achieve the same goal. I really don't want to have to educate you on the drawbacks and honestly, the laziness of simply forking and increasing blocksize. Let's see bcash fill a 1mb block with anything other than spam and maybe I will look into it. Also what the hell kind of cocaine are you using? "literally incapable?" Sir, I have used lightning already to buy real things both online and in person, and it has been amazing. Fuck right off, please. Just because eclair doesn't have a specific feature at this time doesn't mean it never will, and to even put that forward as some sort of idea is completely asinine, even for an obvious idiot like yourself.

worse? I bought a burger from a food truck and got 20% off the fiat price conversion by using lightning network. You are an absolute idiot if you think this space is getting worse. Governments can't stop it and fiat is much much riskier. if you knew even a little bit of the history of money you would agree with that. We now have the power to store our wealth in a series of words that we can memorize and access it at any time any where. That is incredibly powerful.

@_date: 2018-08-03 02:08:15
yeah but the cool thing is if bitcoin is no longer your thing like someone else said, you can go make what you think is a better cryptocurrency. bcash is unique in that its leadership and fans constantly pitch it as bitcoin instead of what it is, a forked altcoin of bitcoin. That's the issue. Satoshi's vision is not an argument because it doesn't matter.

From what I can tell of listening to his podcast during long drives and whatnot as critically as I can, he would simply prefer a society that more than less respects property rights and does not accept using monopolistic violence \(the state\) to plunder the wealth of others without their consent \(taxation\). He really draws ire with the idea that the government uses shadow taxation\(inflation\) to hurt new generations as well as using war to prop up the justification for the existence of the state. With that, everything else would fall into place and the market would take care of the rest. Not saying I agree or disagree, but that is what I would *think*\*\*  his position is from listening to his thoughts for a few years. Now, if you disagree  or have more questions, you can go on his podcast and debate him. He usually welcomes it. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:57:14
What drives innovation in industry in a communist utopia, exactly? Since the profit motive is gone, do you expect people to just innovate and bust their ass and take risks with no reward? This is just mind numbingly retarded. I suppose you hate jews just like Marx did, as well?  The fact is that Communism has killed nearly 100,000,000 people. Let that sink in.  Why would you choose that over a free society? What is wrong with a free society to you? This is another good one: 
I suppose you have no problem at all with any of that.

I agree completely. Just saying firearms are inanimate objects and no one has proven that a gun has ever killed anyone to this day.

All your points are based off the assumption that I believe I currently live in a free society which is incorrect. Freedom is simply a reasonable expectation that you will not experience violence, coercion, or theft from the state. As long as taxation exists at the threat of violence, we are not free. As long as the state exists, we are not free. Your rambling about money is anecdotal and not worth addressing. You want to be a hippy then go be one, just don't use the violent nature of the state to steal from those who create value in society so you can paint. If people want money then let them compete in the market for it. If you don't, then that's your choice. If your ideas require the violent nature of the state to implement then we're enemies. I wouldn't call on violence on you so it's pretty sad you'd do it to me.

@_date: 2018-05-20 21:11:31
Yeah I get it. It's disturbing. But how is he wrong, scientifically and empirically? That's the thing. Also, he is talking about groups not individuals so you shouldn't take it personally.  Even though these statements are disturbing I don't see how they are untrue or show any bias. I know smart people that have a genetic background that has lower IQ than those with other genetic backgrounds, doesn't mean that person I know is stupid or can't operate in a free society. That's not Stefan's argument. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:20:58
There is no capitalism today. Capitalism means choice of the individual to use the market to accumulate capital. There is no such thing as capitalist oppression. Only corporatism exists now. Don't confuse these things.

Communism has been the direct cause of approximately 100,000,000 deaths. Marx was an anti semite, and a a sour vengeful and jealous person who ranted and raved about bringing down his betters in violence and revolution for no reason other than ego. He demanded the circumvention of human nature in exchange for servitude to a collective hive that neither existed nor died, constantly toiling and existing but never living. A society where each person was to be issued their needs dictated by those at the top, rather than their own personal human drive to succeed. Innovation is useless, and human progress is useless to Marx. The only thing that matters is that  every person got the same amount at the bread line. Education and invention are punished and philosophy and free thought are a death sentence. This is communism; this is marxism. Nothing more needs to be said than that. You support horrors you can't possibly fathom, for if you truly knew what you claim to understand, you would be horrified as well.

This has nothing to do with political philosophy or American opinion. This is just about objective truth. It's very obvious that when you put just a little bit of critical thinking into it you realize not only can you have rules without rulers, but it is a much better foundation for civilization. Bitcoin is a great example of how this works with it's consensus mechanism. Society can (and should) operate in a similar way. Elevating humans to have powers to dictate (modern government models) based solely on their own singular opinion is as antiquated as feudalism. Let's innovate.

Exactly! This dude is not to be trusted. Bitcoin is free speech money and Jack hates free speech.

Agreed. Bitcoin is a tool in that fight. Just one of many. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:12:00
I'm not saying I have the answers. I never said that even once. It is possible to recognize and cast a light on a problem without having an immediate solution. I don't offer an immediate solution. I am recognizing a problem and trying to help more people recognize the problem. Hopefully someone smarter than me will develop the answer. As for right now I at least still have the mental fortitude to recognize violence and theft are wrong. I'm saying if more people rejected, instead of embraced violence, theft, and coercion, then the probability of the problem being solved increases. The state indoctrination of the young is a stranglehold on innovation, it is a way to put minds in cages rather than be free. We need to break more minds out of those cages.

It's also not okay to create an environment where your SO is afraid of telling the truth and being open with you, or having productive discussions about particular topics.

When I built it back in January I had no experience at all...I just followed this guide with the expectation that this is a learning experience first and foremost...and I am still learning. I haven't and don't plan to make money from it. I simply enjoy the hobby and helping the network. In theory as the network grows bigger though, according to Alex, the nodes that have been around the longest will be the most trusted so I was excited to get in early. I have opened aprox 20million SAT worth of channels, and more have opened with me. It is exciting to watch and learn.   
@_date: 2019-03-07 18:31:15
I found it incredibly easy to setup my node. Which part did you have issues with that made you give up?

I only use it to buy as a long term HODLer. I post an offer to buy at 1% less than market price and someone usually scoops it up within a day, sometimes within just a few hours. The trade itself is usually really fast. In my experience most people just want to get it over with.

just look around...it's already happening on many apps/wallets/etc.  no one says "zero point zero zero zero zero one bitcoins" anymore. The SAT is the standard. And right now a dollar can roughly be traded for 10,000SAT. That's amazing.

You explain to me why you think we can't meet those needs without violence. Why is theft, coercion, and violence necessary to accomplish those goals? Can we not come up with something better?  Are you incapable of imagining a world where one of the 7.5+ billion people out there can come up with better solutions to collective problems that doesn't rely on theft and violence? Do you really think this is the BEST we can come up with? YOU ARE INDOCTRINATED TO BE A SLAVE TO THE STATE. BREAK FREE. If you can't do so physically then FREE YOUR OWN MIND at least!

Then your node will simply disconnect. It's not too big of a deal. all you would have to do is shut down the LND client, and then shut down the bitcoind clinet, and restart the raspberry pi, and boot it all up again(syncing the blockchain, then opening LND to sync). It's a process but it's not bad at  all. I had to do it a couple times for updates and such .

I feel like I'm talking to someone from last year. What does an exchange have to do with anything? We are talking about bitcoin don't change the topic. Development has been moving forward all year. I suggest you study up... Or you can continue embarrassing yourself. Whatever you want

If it goes to zero it will be because the satoshi becomes the unit of account ahead of the dollar and no one is willing to except dollars for satoshis anymore.
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:56:11
Um, if bitcoin goes to $0, it's not because bitcoin is worthless, it's because no one would be dumb enough to accept fiat in exchange for bitcoin. I for one welcome $0.

The implementation of Liquid that blockstream is deciding to deploy isn't trustless like the original goal was. However, like the press release says, development is ongoing, and this tech could eventually render exchanges obsolete. Privacy would be born. No need for trusting centralized shady as fuck exchanges. You could swap, trade, etc. peer to peer completely privately. In theory, you could go to a store that only accepts Monero, but you have bitcoin. No problem, use your bitcoin that instantly converts to Monero privately, securely, and quickly using atomic/swap etc. tech. That is the end-game goal for Blockstream's Liquid technology. Get excited. The revolution is just heating up.

Just curious, who said it wouldn't take time for the system to improve and it would happen instantly? I would like to know who said that and why you believed them. You cannot refute the fact that segwit and LN has improved scaling, which is what I wrote. I did not say they solved scaling. Stop and focus on what people write and you might not come off as such a moron.

The more shitcoins the better for bitcoin...state and non-state backed shitcoin development casts an invisibility cloak over bitcoin which is great because when we are ready there will be no stopping us.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index, prices in 2018 are 2,941.43% higher than prices in 1860. The dollar experienced an average inflation rate of 2.28% per year during this period.
In other words, $1 in 1860 is equivalent in purchasing power to $30.41 in 2018, a difference of $29.41 over 158 years. 
So... you tell me what is better to hold.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:10:45

Yes but it's easy to just have the option for on chain or lightning for your customer. Less fees for them using ln. They don't need a node just a channel. Nodes are only required for accepting, not sending.

The commenter implied that Dr. Paul if president would ban abortions. The commenter said that because he has been told that, because if he actually knew Dr. Paul's position through objective discovery he would realize that his source of information is false. Dr. Paul believes it falls to the 10th amendment to make final decision on the practice. He has never called for a federal ban of abortions. To blindly follow the claims of others without confirmation   is what NPCs do. Hence, this guy is an NPC. Now piss off. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:17:11

You're joking right? A bitcoin transaction appears on the block explorer usually within 5 seconds. That's enough to buy a $8 sandwich. No one is going to go through the arduous process of attempting to double spend a fucking $8 sandwich lol. It'll get fully confirmed for negligible fee(a few pennies) in approx 20 minutes. Now let's look at visa. Visa charges the merchant a heavy fee to use its processing, the transaction is maybe 2 seconds faster than bitcoin, but takes 3-5 business days to fully process. Compare this to bitcoin 20-30 minutes it's really obvious which is better. With that said, lightning network adds nearly infinite scaling and is working great for many merchants and customers all around the world which further destroys the argument that visa, PayPal, etc are in any way faster or cheaper. You have to educate yourself more or you'll just continue to embarrass yourself.

@_date: 2018-06-27 14:03:41
to say that water = wet therefore fire = hot is asinine. One is describing an object(wet) the other is describing the temperature of the object(hot). So, at the very least come up with a better word to describe fire that correlates with what it does to objects because hot does not work.
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:51:48
Nope.

I don't entertain Keynesian garbage, sorry. I fundamentally disagree with debt being a good thing, ever. That's not to say that sometimes one has to go into debt for certain reasons, but that doesn't mean it's good. We fundamentally come from different schools of economic thought,  so what's the point?

You are misunderstanding my point. Knowledge of the tech gives one confidence regardless of the conversion volatility. Without BASIC knowledge of the tech and the future aspects, one is more likely to panic sell. I am specifically talking about bitcoin tech.  So, calm your tits. Thanks.

Fan boy buzzwords? It's clear you have no basic understanding of bitcoin or crypto. I can tell exactly who you are. You bought in on the hype around 16k, doing no research into the tech but greed took over, and you watched the USD rate crash and you finally sold out at 9k. You believed in "HODL" until that point...and now you got burned by your own stupidity. So, to make yourself feel better you troll the bitcoin subreddit, talking uneducated nonsense and insulting those more intelligent than yourself. Got that about right?

I was thinking about linking a few older books on it, but since this is a bitcoin sub I will just link one that spends the first half talking about what makes money money and how bitcoin in the future could MAYBE find its place in that environment in the future. It does go into why work(mining) is important for sound money and it was a pretty good read. I don't think the future he proposes is going to be the one to play out but the reasoning is sound.

Someone who is in it for the tech is someone who runs at least one node. Someone who is actively involved in testing new layer developments. It's someone who watches presentations by the top devs and gets excited when they hear about atomic swaps, schnorr signatures, and lightning network. it's someone who seeks knowledge and understanding of all the pieces that makes bitcoin work. It's someone who sees bitcoin as a hobby rather than an investment vehicle. It's through this knowledge and drive to understand that makes one realize fiat conversion rates mean nothing. The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements  like Dr. Wuille care about price? Many of us are in it for the tech. Many of us don't care enough to tango with the get rich crowd. I'm a special kind of masochist I guess.

Ah. I don't believe I will ever have to convert satoshis back to fiat, as I am in on the ground floor of layer 2/3 development and have personally talked to folks from blockstream and acinq. Some of the stuff on the horizon is amazing...submarine swaps, atomic swaps, schnorr signatures. I have zero doubt in the future of bitcoin buying power. I have already had the pleasure of using lightning network to buy food and items in person, as well as online. It's good stuff. Give it a few years to mature.

I consider myself more of an adopter, but to answer your original question. How did I "like it?" I felt nothing really. I accumulated on the way up I accumulated on the way down. In the last 12 months we have seen nearly 700&amp; growth in strength against the USD fiat currency. I have nothing to complain about. 7k, 17k, 170k, I don't really care. A bitcoin is a bitcoin. I dump as much as my fiat as I can because I avoid centralized monopolies whenever possible. And before you ask, of course I still hold some fiat as bitcoin is not usable yet for all the commerce I need to be involved in, but the fiat I convert to bitcoin I have no reason to ever convert back.

Then you must understand the revolution on the horizon. There are some arguably solid altcoin projecets, however, if you look at the top 10 coins last year compared to this year you will see that things change fast. If you are in it for the tech then there are only a few players worth mentioning. Also, you haven't mentioned if you are in it for the BTC comparative or for USD, which are vastly different markets. I will admit I am a bitcoin absolutist but that does not mean I don't dabble in alt trading when there is blood on the streets in the BTC comparative to try to make a few satoshis. The entire market tends to follow bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:38:48

What do you think happens when you suddenly are able to turn a simple text messaging phone in the middle of a rural area in Nigeria, connected to a solar panel, into a bank terminal? Into a Western Union remittance terminal? Into an international loan origination system? A stock market? An IPO engine? At first, nothing. But give it a few years. We have seen what happens with the development of the cell phone technology that was deployed in Africa faster than any other technology ever in the history of humanity. We see small villages, where they have no running water, wood fires to cook with, and no electricity yet there's one little solar panel on top of a mud hut and that solar panel is not there for light. It's there to charge a Nokia 1000 feature phone. That phone gives them weather reports, grain prices at the local market, and connects them to the world. What happens when that phone becomes a bank? Because with bitcoin it can be a bank. What happens when you connect 6.5 billion people to a global economy without any barriers to access? -Andreas Antonopoulos

Only if you can show me in the code where it says bitcoin is dependent on valuation in fiat. When bitcoin was first being used it did not have any fiat valuation. It wasn't until humans started valuating in fiat that it became a thing. It is not native to bitcoin, the network, or the protocol.  fiat valuation means zilch.

First thing, your girlfriend is a bitch. Forget about her. Second thing, for my girlfriend (now my wife :D ) I explained bitcoin as simply a different kind of savings account. So "buying" bitcoin doesn't sound like gambling, we are simply saving in a modern way. Today I was like, "Hey, dear. I threw $500 into bitcoin savings today." and her response was "cool sounds good." Third, fuck everyone. I was known as the bitcoin guy at work until recently. I told everyone back in july I sold at 10k and am no longer interested. Only my wife knows and like I said, we just think of it as a savings mechanism.

What specific uses? I have already said... TRUSTLESS, BORDERLESS, AND PERMISSION-LESS means of wealth transfer. That is what I use it for. Yes I am sure I get all the functionality. If I lose my wallet do I have insurance? ...is...are you for real? This is the kind of question that convinces me you don't have the slightest clue what bitcoin is or how it works. If I lose my "wallet" then I simply use  my mnemonic seed words and recover the wallet. Do you think that bitcoin are actually stored in bitcoin wallets? Do you think people upload them or something like a USB drive? Is that what you think?
edit: For your second paragraph, these poor countries are poor not because they don't do anything of value. You implying that is really kind of jacked up. The countries are poor because their government sucks at managing monetary policy. Bitcoin gets around the corrupt governments of the world who devalue and debase and force their people to be poor by offering a (I will say it again) TRUSTLESS, BORDERLESS, AND PERMISSION-LESS means of wealth transfer. That is huge. You need to do your research. Bitcoin is better, and it will always be better because it is (here we go again...) a TRUSTLESS, BORDERLESS, AND PERMISSION-LESS means of wealth transfer. Centralization cannot be trusted. Decentralize all the things. Do not trust institutions. They don't give a shit about you. Trust yourself. Bitcoin gives you the power to opt out of the debt slave game. Cling to your dollars and your institutions all you want. They are going the way of the horse and buggy soon enough.

Someone who is in it for the tech is someone who runs at least one node. Someone who is actively involved in testing new layer developments. It's someone who watches presentations by the top devs and gets excited when they hear about atomic swaps, schnorr signatures, and lightning network. it's someone who seeks knowledge and understanding of all the pieces that makes bitcoin work. It's someone who sees bitcoin as a hobby rather than an investment vehicle. It's through this knowledge and drive to understand that makes one realize fiat conversion rates mean nothing. The tech development doesn't care about price. The top devs certainly don't care. Do you think brilliant devs who sacrifice everything for bitcoin improvements like Dr. Wuille care about price? Many of us are in it for the tech. Many of us don't care enough to tango with the get rich crowd. I'm a special kind of masochist I guess.

@_date: 2019-10-30 14:51:40
Of course broken down to SAT, or even miliSAT if you go to layer2+. The benefit is that the bitcoin reserve bank will be able to prove to those that use their currency that they actually have the bitcoin in reserve on a consistent basis. This will increase faith that the SAT backed currency is legitimate, and can always be exchanged back for SATs if demanded. The first country to do this will have a HUGE upper hand in the future. Entire Security field specializations will revolve around securing reserve SATs.

To understand that you have to understand why mining (or rather how putting in work gives an object monetary potential) and scarcity is in integral component to hard money, whether done by manual labor with gold etc. or through electricity. You then have to understand the profit motive of the bitcoin miners and how the hash rate and mempools affect the network. It doesn't really seem you put a lot of work into acquiring this sort of understanding so I don't really want to engage you in this conversation anymore. Good luck, man.
@_date: 2019-10-02 14:02:03
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:39:13
So you're saying since bitcoin doesn't 
provide the ability to bury myself in debt that it is useless? Lol okay. Bitcoin doesn't require permission from a third party to transmit or receive transactions. It cannot be frozen. It is borderless and permissionless. There is no ceo or head at the top; it's decentralized. It is completely liquid and completely under my control. I am my own bank. It's clear you have no understanding of the basics of bitcoin. Best go learn or go away.

Just because you make stuff up doesn't mean it's true. Generic bitcoin addresses are public, yes. But the CEO of bitcoin (lol) can't just look up a name and literally see everything you are doing.

So you're lashing out because of jealousy. Thanks for admitting it at least. 
@_date: 2019-08-25 21:27:32
Thanks for sharing that completely non-obvious knowledge.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:49:22
Selling fiat yep
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:28:03
Sell. Bitcoin isn’t for you.
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:37:05
I'm just buying  and accumulating the same way I always have. Not bothering me a bit. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:19:02
already on tor with dissenter backup. thx tho
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:06:58
meh. bisq is better.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:41:01
Ha same
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:05:55
they are using bitpay. bunch of assholes. remember, bitcoiners dont let friends use bitpay (either for merchant services or as customer)
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:47:13
It's only because I care. Basically anything is better than coinbase. I don't deal with KYC shit so I use bisq for stacking sats, but my buddy uses cashapp and you can buy sats, and send to your wallet all within 1 minute. No waiting for hours or days like with coinbase. It's KYC but relatively bare-bones KYC. My advice? Get onto bisq and take control of your privacy.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:04:45
hodl until infinity, boyz.
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:09:03
Shitcoin clown fiesta. Why does this kind of garbage get upvoted on the fucking bitcoin sub? You guys make no sense.
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:49:04
How did you forget the most important rule? Not your keys not your coins. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:40:16
It's pretty easy now. I use it a lot. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:13:11
okay? So what?
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:34:54
I would never ever digitize my keys, but that's just me. Crypto steel buried somewhere with a 25th secret seed word for further security is my go to.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:43:46
Bitcoin.page should be the community's official site. It has everything.

Bitcoin doesn't care about attitudes

Sounds like you're sketch
@_date: 2019-06-01 06:25:41
No terms I just know how to set it up if you have questions or need assistance. Do you want to host it local or cloud?
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:54:39
so its just a gambling platform and has nothing to do with bitcoin at all other than using bitcoin's USD conversion to gamble with. thats pretty dumb. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:10:02
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:06:13
Being pro-bitcoin on the bitcoin subreddit in 2019 I guess? 
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:37:57
10k is a believable mark to do as well, which is why for about a year I had this planned. Next time 10k, I say I sold.
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:46:04
Um...when did anyone say it was an investment? Only newbs look at bitcoin as an investment. Maybe you should study too.
@_date: 2019-10-02 01:13:10
Lol what? Game devs can change this shit on a whim. You're a special kind of dumb lmao
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:09:47
I agree. Let's talk about the "filtering out the noise" part though. If the mechanism to filter out the noise is centralized and dependent on the whims of very powerful ideologues, then it is better to have no filter at all. If this filter is to be just and fair then it must be decentralized with some sort of consensus mechanism. I agree with the reddit part...it's not perfect but it's basically the best we got at this point.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:47:34
Still tax micro transaction
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:04:07
Wtf we already established sats. Gtfo

bitcoin doesn't care who takes what serious
@_date: 2019-10-21 20:20:49
Bitcoin doesn't care about what we argue about. You are ignoring my points completely so why should I even engage? Enjoy your fiat scams...I will opt out and take control of my own wealth, thanks.

who cares
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:38:45
haha ya know the worst thing is that $1  is worth less than 10,000 SATs now
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:22:30
It's not, but it's decentralized and private and can never be shut down... Try it out.
@_date: 2019-06-15 03:54:09
Good for bitcoin.

Use BISQ  for buying, Use Wasabi or Samouri whirlpool for cleaning, and use bitrefill for buying stuff. Keep your keys safe, and don't tell anyone.
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:15:38
i do all my buys on bisq...never had any issues for about...idunno 6 months now or so . never sold tho. So, you should apologize for lying. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-06-14 12:58:53
Care to actually make an example of a concern?

ehhh...really? You don't have to "cash out" to reap the rewards of greater purchasing power.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:08:37
I feel that. Just want somewhere to have a beer and read that's not my apartment lol

I love how you write off privacy loss like no big deal. Btcpayserver is stupid easy to deploy plus you get lightning network.
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:46:27
$10 still gets you more than 100,000 sats... Give me a break.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:47:30
You must be new
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:03:46
bisq does the same thing. its p2p no third party.
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:17:31
There's literally one click azure deployment, or can host on vps through docker in just a few steps. I don't understand how it can get easier. The guy can make a website so I'm sure they can setup the dns point. I don't understand why you assume they are stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:58:46
be sure to provide a discount for those who pay with bitcoin, since you can carry over the 3rd party processor cost and provide that to your customers as a discount. That will make them at least inquire as to what they can do to get the discount. 10% or so. Not saying do that forever, but until it becomes mainstream its the best way to get potential customers to be interested in using that as a payment method.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:59:17
Eh ownership is not a spectrum. You don't have the private keys you don't own the bitcoin. But I mean if your goal is to have more worthless inflationary government fiat paper, go for it.
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:45:56
Never have enough but 100000sat is still under $10. Still cheap.
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:22:54

LOL. Read what I wrote again, I think it went over your head.
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:09:17
Nope. It's insured for the bank. And I mean that the banks and anyone else has instant access to all your transaction history. It's not private. Have you never once thought about it?

@_date: 2019-02-19 20:03:39
Bull trap imo. It's not real until we get a bitcoin rally in conjunction with a shitcoin sell off. As long as people are still buying shitcoins then we have a long way to go still.

@_date: 2019-06-24 20:30:46
nooo. im not selling or anything. I am simply TELLING PEOPLE that I did, so they will leave me the fuck alone. I am a HODLer for life. No one knows how much I have, but a few at work and a few "friends" know I am somewhat into the space(none really know how damn deep I am down he rabbit hole though). To all of them that inquire, I will tell them I sold. I don't want to talk to them about it anymore. They had their chance, I opened the door for them, but they are all idiots so screw em. It's my secret now.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:51:37

that's actually a scam site, no joke.
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:42:18
That fiat has anything to do with the Bitcoin network or the bitcoin money. Humans themselves place that property onto it by imagination. It has nothing to do with the system at all.
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:05:49
Lol okay 
@_date: 2019-02-16 15:42:39
Pretty much this. I couldn't care less what the ruling class thinks. 
@_date: 2019-10-21 02:20:31
That's not bitcoins problem. That's bad user opsec. You wouldn't leave your wallet outside your door at night would you? There are plenty of ways to obfuscate and achieve fungibility. Just like there are better places to put your wallet at night than on your doorstep.
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:55:11

@_date: 2019-06-05 19:45:12
lol what? Dips from the top. so the most recent top. it was 9000 so i bought at 8000 as well as 7000, if it gets that far. ill buy on friday at around noon regardless of price. idk i have my system it works fine.

What's goin on
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:06:48
I buy every Friday and every 10% dip. Cheap sats are great.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:43:53
I do, but that is probably because I deleted my coinbase account years ago because I'm not a tool.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:18:51
ugh even the way you write that is packed with ignorance.

Offer makers pay 0.1% of the trade amount, and offer takers pay 0.3% of the trade amount. The minimum in both cases is 0.00005 BTC to avoid dust limits. Fees paid with BSQ can be as much as 90% lower.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:24:46
bitcoin should not be considered an investment...but fuck it whatever.

you are encouraged to generate the wallet on a device that has never ever been connected to the internet before if you want to have the most secure wallet. Further, ideally it would be a linux system I have heard. I use multiple hardware wallets myself with a special code system I created to store my seed words.

You can throw out random ass scenarios all you want. I am not saying avoid taxes. I am saying this isn't a get rich quick scheme and it's annoying that so many idiots still think it is.

Cool I use vultr vps to host my btcpay. I use Debian destro for it. I then point a subdomain from my website at the ip address of the vps, and through that subdomain I access my btcpay settings. My store then uses the btcpay woocommerce pluggin to pull from the server. It took me a while to figure it out but once I did it was awesome. Totally worth it.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:46:59
I agree. I actually wanted bitcoin core btcc but the fuckers over at bitcoin.com gave me lousy bitcoin labeled as bitcoin core.
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:24:56
you could run btcpay and use your ipad as a point of sale terminal by connecting through it, yes.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:34:23
Why do they need to know that? Can't you make shit up
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:32:38
God damn you are beyond retarded lol. Bitcoiners have known that the internet is not needed for the network to operate for half a decade if not  longer. This is COMMON KNOWLEDGE. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:06:37
I do exactly that. My node runs on a raspberry pi, and the bulk of my stash private keys are securely stored on a hardware wallet. I still don't understand what you mean by run a node on a hardware wallet though.

Should we let? What power do you have to stop it? Bitcoin is open. You can do whatever you want.
@_date: 2019-06-16 03:32:35
Do not use coinbase. Use btcpayserver. Coinbase is a centralized institution that is anti bitcoin and a third party who charges fees. Be your own payment processor. No middle man.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:12:51
which wallet do you have? Popular options include a software wallet such as electrum, or hardware wallet such as a trezor. Once you establish your wallet you use your public key to transfer your btc off of coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:23:34
lmao I agree completely! Anything over $1000 in my checking account goes straight to btc and my wallet. Fiat can go die. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:39:42
I'd say maybe 50000 is too late 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:58:14
I don't support any regulation, but I'd like to see bitcoin (and the blockchain) completely replace banks (for me it has. My checking account is bitcoin) eventually.

possible, but the source code for the blockchain is open source, and not very long. If there were any devastating vulnerabilities it would have been found by now I think.

@_date: 2017-11-28 10:22:39
yeah it will say pending and then you will get a transaction ID number. You use that ID number to keep tabs on how many confirmations you have. You need at least 6 confirmations for the transfer to complete. Depending on current blockchain volume I estimate that would take from 15 mins to an hour.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:41:58
how is this a hack? the blockchain cannot be hacked.

of course not. but new companies will rise to fill the void that is consumer demand. t mobile did it when verizon was being a shit head, and if the damn market was allowed to work(government regulation stifles this), then it would also happen to internet. but no, lets just go to government.

Bitcoin is both a giffen good and a Veblen good.A Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa — seemingly in violation of basic laws of demand in microeconomics such as with substitute goods and the income effect. Veblen goods are types of luxury goods for which the quantity demanded increases as the price increases in an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.  You are thinking about the whole thing from the wrong angle.

Tip 
 Bitcoin should NOT be considered an investment.
The fundamental value of Bitcoin is that it represents a virtual medium of exchange. That means that it is a digital commodity that is primarily of practical value and not an investment
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:15:17
It's pretty low

Why do you people make it so complicated? Just use bitcoin as a deflationary means to store your wealth. Sit on it until you need it or spend it if you want to...it's not complicated. Watching the USD conversion rate is fun, but it's not the point.

yeah. the more forks, the more people will realize which is the king and it will be safer to just start your own thing (dash, vtc, monero, etc) than it is to play with the original blockchain.

Judging by your name, you are into XMR. That's cool. Did you know that XMR has potential vulnerabilities that could possibly pave the way for individuals to create XMR out of thin air, and corrupting the supply? If this happened then no one would know, as the supply is not something public and measured. Besides that, XMR is extremely centralized. All XMR is good for is converting back and from bitcoin to increase privacy of bitcoin holdings. This will no longer be the case soon, as wallets such as wasabi plus the upcoming huge upgrades to bitcoin (schnoor, tap/graftroot, LN, etc.) will make XMR useless. Bitcoin is king. You shitcoiners will realize it eventually.

I agree but lightning network protects you from chsinalysis and all that crap. Taproot, graft root, schnorr, and Bech32 all does or will increase privacy on chain as well.

i think so too, but most didnt see the attempted flippening, which was doomed to fail anyway but was fun to watch. corrections will happen. bitcoin is still a new thing and will still go through growing pains. in 6 months a correction may be many thousands of dollars. going to have to just stay tough, hodl through, buy cheap. bitcoin isnt going anywhere.

bitcoin is not an investment. it is a technology that allows you to safely store and transfer wealth. 
edit: When the price goes up that is a bonus. The true value is that I can move my wealth around anonymously and safely OUTSIDE of the control of the banking cartels.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:06:37
When someone asks me if they should buy bitcoin I say no, but they should do their own research and decide on their own. I am not a financial adviser so i never tell people what to buy. That's why I phrased it like that.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:03:01
Not true. Bitcoin can (and does in many ways) exist without the internet. This has been proven over and over. Does the internet make it easier? Sure. Is the internet necessary for the bitcoin network to function? Nope. It seems you haven't yet grasped the basics of Bitcoin. Your asinine facebook analogy cements this fact quite clearly. I can suggest a few resources for you if you like.

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:47:43
this is very true. I think I know which will win. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:30:29
Yep, I would. But thanks to cointracking.com it's not hard to report it in my taxes, but yes I would eat the tax. However, the question then becomes is realizing those gains a good idea, if re-buying at the dip increases profit?

 Bitcoin should NOT be considered an investment.
The fundamental value of Bitcoin is that it represents a virtual medium of exchange. That means that it is a digital commodity that is primarily of practical value and not an investment

fuck you @_date: 2017-11-30 13:38:49
ugh. i hate when people say investing in relation to bitcoin. It's simply an exchange from fiat to digital. There is no dividends. There is no quarterly report. Anyone who says bitcoin is an investment I treat as a red flag that they aren't fully educated on the topic.

the word that describes this, if you are curious is "fungible" and it is a great feature of the bitcoin ecosystem/structure. anyone can get some! its borderless and inclusive. At this point, 1 bitcoin can be broken down this far: 1.00000000 --- if for any reason this is not enough someday, we can program in an extra spot and authorize it through consensus.

you gotta understand. bitcoin is not a stock. It is not a business. It is an ecosystem of money, that is revolutionary. There is no "bubble." There are speculators that speculate, but that's not the point of bitcoin. The point of bitcoin is to have a borderless, trustless, secure, and FREE means to transport, store, spend, and save your wealth...free of government or banking manipulation or inflation. This is 1994 internet. Back then people thought the internet was just a passing fad. I wonder what those people think now.

I suggest you all read the internet of money by andreas... If you don't get it you need extra help

LETS DO THIS BOYSSSSSS
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:10:51
yeah i hear ya. i slightly regret selling but it is what it is and i gotta identify my buy-back points. Taxes will be fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:25
ceo of blockchain? wut
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:17:07
well, right now its value comes from the borderless and secure means to store and transfer wealth. Bitcoin is my bank. It is more secure than any 3rd party bank, it is transferable, fungible, and does not need a 3rd trusted party to manage. That's it's current value. It's value as a currency will come, as the devs are working very hard to get scaling under control, and other upgrades. This is 1994 internet. You couldn't send photos in email when email first came out, doesn't mean email will always stay like that. same thing goes for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:17:57
Super duper 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:03:18
5500!!!!! Come onnn
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:49:27
Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme. You should do some research so you don't go into it with the wrong mindset. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:40:48
Honestly, the fact that I am my own bank makes me sleep so much better. Not only that, but it's the most secure bank ever devised. Inflation tax isn't hitting me, and the banks aren't loaning out my wealth to others. I only realized this recently that  for me this is the true reason to go all in. The fact that BTC price is going up is just icing on the cake. I am just happy to be safe with my assets. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:45:27
at least tree fiddy 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:38:37
youre a moron. of course there will be speculation causing dips and corrections. doesnt mean its going to zero. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 02:24:45
Nope. It's going to be all at once. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:49:57
You keep your fiat to begin with, genius. Only covert to bitcoin what you intend to use as bitcoin. How is this so fucking complicated for you?

Thanks. Major salary boost so I hope I can catch back up and continue the 1mil club quest quickly. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:12:38
It's the internet of money. If you don't get that you need to study the tech. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:03:25
sweet. good luck
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:35:09
I dont think I have the experience to say if thats a good idea or not. I would like to smoothly transfer btc without fear of long confirmation times or high fees. I trust the devs to get this sorted out as btc goes mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:04:17
Can't wait until I move to a new city and find a BTC dealer through localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:13:16
They are our long-term enemies. I don't think you can change the minds of these people. They need their ruling class to protect them because they can't solve their own problems through negotiation/peaceful methods. They are cowards who instead of just taking the fruits of my labor from me themselves, they band together to form a gang of representatives (government) to do it on their behalf so they can get their freebies. They are truly enemies of the species and honestly the best we can do is just ignore them as much as we can. We need to get together, form meetups, and give our children the environment to cultivate critical thinking as they grow up. We stick together, and peace will win hopefully in the next few hundred years. It's not our fight, its our kids fight. Our fight is helping the kids learn how to think and de-program as much as we can.  These people don't fundamentally get bitcoin philosophically and are just in it for the get-rich quick FOMO.

Okay 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:56:18
bitcoin is my bank, and I realized this too. It turned me into not only a HODLer but a SAVER. I am lucky to have bitcoin as my bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:48:18
dude i bought at $4300 before it got slapped down to $3300 back in september. dont worry. it gets better. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:48:52
i predict 12k. this shit is going parabolic. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:44:19
Probably not. NN is government control of the internet. That's probably worse for BTC than the free market competition of internet service. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:22:19
I think of it like email. When email first came out, could only send a few kb of text. then slowly you could add attachments, bigger attachments, etc. Progress will come in time, and if taken the time to do it right (unlike jackass Ver and crew), bitcoin will be the catalyst for the destruction of the banking system just how email destroyed writing letters (unless you are super romantic). 
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:30:54
next bear market will be the 200k--&gt;40k cycle, then its onto 1mil, boys.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:27:48
Nice. I tend to DCA every friday, but I looked through all my buys and stuff and it turns out I actually threw an assload of money in the 3k-range...pretty great stuff. Totally forgot about that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:02:07
There is no infirmary because the reactor exploded!
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:05:29
none of those are competing with fiat money. You cant compare any of that with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:55:49
Exactly. Bitcoin is NOT an investment. It's FREE technology to allow a person to be their own bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:48:09
Yeah this did nothing 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:08:12
 Speech is a right. Silencing others is not a right. You can CHOOSE to not listen, but you can NOT choose to silence those you do not like without violating the rights of the one speaking. Do you even know how twitter works? YOU CAN ALREADY BLOCK PEOPLE YOU DON'T LIKE. So what is the point of banning people from the entire platform if the goal is anything other than pure silence of opposing viewpoints to that of the silicon valley ideological bubble? Jack is a fucking assclown and it makes me sick that this sub is masturbating furiously to his bullshit.
@_date: 2019-02-13 15:07:13

@_date: 2017-11-29 00:39:31
because its a retarded question. sorry to be blunt. but it really is. what you are pitching as a negative is one of the very things which gives bitcoin value and makes it better than blackhole fiat dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:17:38
Never selling, only buying. I look forward to a dip for the discount! But if not, that's cool too. New asset class being born. Enjoy the ride, folks. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:31:01
Not really. Bitcoin is the safest and most secure way to store wealth. It's my bank. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:56:27
depends on what the exchange method is 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:04:33

open source development will improve all those things. lightning.network is extremely promising. Think of the internet in 1994. You are the one saying "THIS WILL ALWAYS BE THE WAY IT IS." Like I said, your ignorance is showing. do some research. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:19:40
i dont understand it. you said you want to send 5000 bitcoin to the blockchain(a wallet). How long does it take? Um. either 15 minutes to an hour probably. How soon would you get a notification that its happening? Within 2-3 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:30:46
not planning on selling. BTC will overtake fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:20:02
you realize that you get a private key so if the hardware fails, etc. you can just go to blockchain.info and reclaim  your coins right?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:26
5200 minimum maybe less on this correction. sorry guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:08:58
i highly doubt we will see sub 6000 again but if that happens ill buy so much :)

@_date: 2017-11-18 18:34:53
This link presents bitcoin as an investment. it is NOT an investment.  . it is a technology that allows you to safely store and transfer wealth.  When the price goes up that is a bonus. The true value is that I can move my wealth around anonymously and safely OUTSIDE of the control of the banking cartels.

actually it is exactly that. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:15:19
Okay? So you are not going to at least admit you are wrong? Since I did provide evidence, the fact that it is not written up by me doesn't invalidate the original point which is that it is in fact possible for bitcoin to exist, and operate, without the internet.

@_date: 2017-11-16 21:37:13
you only own your coin if you have the private key. so no, if your btc is on an exchange theres no blockchain transaction. coinbase is simply allocating a portion of THEIR btc to your coinbase account.

It's almost impossible to predict or know, and it's kind of a waste of time to try to, in my opinion. This is all new. Nothing like this has happened before. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:48:56
its because this is the internet of money. Just like the internet revolutionized how we communicate and send/receive information, bitcoin and the blockchain is revolutionizing how we store, transfer, and exchange wealth and create/verify contracts. There is no limit. This is the equivalent to 1994 internet. Just the beginning. That's your reason.  if the story of bitcoin was 1000 pages we are probably on page 12. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:43:39
Just like internet was a mania. The revolution is happening with or without you

you always fear what you dont understand
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:02:09
its a bunch of words. its basically a cryptographic system to allow you to claim your coins on the blockchain if you lose your actual wallet or something. your trezor words is your private key. coinbase is an exchange so you wont have a private key since you dont own your coins if they are on an exchange. I am impressed you dont know this after actually going so far to actually get a hardware wallet lol

haha its too late to get in on the free money maybe. But it's not too late to have a safe storage of wealth that is controlled only by you, the owner and not the banking cartel.

Bitcoin isn't like apple or google. You don't invest in it. You adopt it. It is a storage of wealth, means of exchange, and someday a unit of account. Uncontrolled by any single entity.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:08:13
right. So either start your own coin, or edit an exiting blockchains code and see if the world will adopt the change (they wont unless its a damn good idea). :)

“Bitcoin represents a fundamental transformation of money. An invention that changes the oldest technology we have in civilization. That changes it radically and disruptively by changing the fundamental architecture into one where every participant is equal. Where transaction has no state or context other than obeying the consensus rules of the network that no one controls. Where your money is yours. You control it absolutely through the application of digital signatures, and no one can censor it, no one can seize it, no one can freeze it. No one can tell you what to do or what not to do with your money. It is a system of money that is simultaneously, absolutely transnational and borderless. We’ve never had a system of money like that.” 
― Andreas M. Antonopoulos, The Internet of Money

This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. It is not an investment. Bitcoin is a new asset class with utility that bypasses governments and central banks. It is the most secure and easy way to transfer, store, and exchange wealth.  this isnt a company like amazon or a stock. this is a new asset class. the first new asset class in centuries.

cable is old technology that is being replaced, so no. Many internet based video entertainment services are competing in the free market now, sprouting up and competing for viewers, and that's where the consumer demand is. Come on.

Sounds like we are trying to do something very similar! I am going to get a proto-website built hopefully before end of the month, then hopefully integrate btcpayserver shortly after that. The confusion I am experiencing is how do I get my website to use btcpayserver to validate transactions through my raspberry pi. I don't even know if it's possible at this point as all the guides I have found require cloud computing subscriptions and stuff like that which I want to avoid.

Yes? Minister of Bitcoin speaking. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:29:02
its because this is the internet of money. Just like the internet revolutionized how we communicate and send/receive information, bitcoin and the blockchain is revolutionizing how we store, transfer, and exchange wealth and create/verify contracts. There is no limit. This is the equivalent to 1994 internet. Just the beginning. That's your reason. if the story of bitcoin was 1000 pages we are probably on page 12.

You didn't address my comment. OPINIONS CANNOT BE PROPERTY. If the SOLE PURPOSE of your website(twitter in this example) is to provide a platform to discuss opinions and ideas. If you censor opinions or ideas based on arbitrary political ideology, then that is effectively claiming ownership of opinions. That is not okay and is a gross violation of free speech rights. You are sick in the head if you think this is okay.

exactly. so why even have the government be involved? We need to DECENTRALIZE (The whole purpose of bitcoin, look what sub youre on for shits sake) the market and let people start up and compete. Giving government absolute control (net neutrality) is the most backward ass way to go about the issue. I don't know about you but I am too old to run to mommy to help me solve my problems.

That's fine. Don't get me wrong. I got Dash, Monero, LTC, ETH, and some others hanging out as well. Bitcoin is the big boy though and lightning.network is super promising. Look into it. It's probably the best scaling solution. As soon as they get it a bit more user friendly and the node operators install it (they will because of the payment incentive) it will  make bitcoin top dog in the micropayment crypto space again in my opinion. lightning.network also increases privacy a lot which is a huge bonus.

think of bitcoin as your bank. thats what I do. No government or bank control of your wealth. Only you. The way it was supposed to be. its absolutely not an investment to me at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:31:17
yep! It's exactly like 1994 internet in media coverage and worldwide acceptance. It's a great time to be alive.

If you use coinbase in any way whatsoever then you don't deserve security. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:58:02
lol i agree...but im a crazy guy apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:21:43
this time next year youre definitely going to know the answer. haha
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:25
lol...okay.  It seems you have a poor grasp on the English language in general. Go enjoy your swing set. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:36:52
i feel the same. not sellin but definitely buying that elusive dip next time
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:35:58
It's good to know others are in this boat. I don't want to be that guy.

it would stabilize eventually. volatility is not always bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:34:20
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:07:50
good. ill buy the dip then.

yeah what if i overclock it for crysis
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:15:00
all i know is bitcoin is a peer to peer network. these bankers have no power here. It will be fun to watch them try. And if they succeed, then bitcoin was flawed to begin with. 
edit: If push comes to shove, bitcoin will fork with almost unanimous consensus to get away from this type of manipulation. My prediction is most people will ignore these scumbags. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:00:54
remember guys, the moon is aprox 240km away...so the moon is $240,000 in my estimation. Not even 3% of the way there. HODL on.

more fork attempts. bitcoin diamond, etc. These failed forks make bitcoin stronger so I welcome them.

@_date: 2017-11-28 14:31:23
i 100% agree with you. bitcoin is my bank and i dont give a shit about corrections, etc. but this would be a good profit play if youre a rich wall streeter wouldnt it?

@_date: 2017-11-28 21:46:28
Bitcoin is both a Giffen good and a Veblen good. A lot of people who call it a bubble or a scam fail to grasp this basic concept. They will be proven wrong in time with their precious wage-dollar that enslaves them to the corrupt cartel system. Let them struggle, I say.

Haha this is me too! HOWEVER, I do not plan on selling. I plan on EVALUATING the current economic climate of the planet at that point and make a sound decision. I will LIKELY continue to HODL until btc replaces fiat completely.

trust your own objective research over opinions from random people on the internet. Thats my advice for this kind of question. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:37:58
It's not open source there's no consensus. This is not going to happen.

yep. i hate the banks that much and i hate the blackhole inflationary garbage known as USD and other fiat government currencies. If bitcoin isn't adopted, then I am more sad that humanity has rejected financial freedom more than i will be sad that i have lost wealth. thankfully, I am very very optimistic of this revolution.

I don't understand the question. The fact that the supply is fixed is a feature not a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:34:25
You should. It's really that simple. Finite supply plus demand equals price goes up

It is my understanding net neutrality means government mandates that the ISPs not try to inhibit access to the entire internet. Through this, the government effectively controls what the ISPs can provide. That's my understanding of net neutrality. Where am I wrong?

@_date: 2017-11-10 10:09:13

Ignorance. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:01:21
speculators could sell and cause a dip, but there will be millions of people from all over the planet ready to gobble it up for the discount. This is money. This is the future. The only way that everything goes to shit is if there is some vulnerability in the blockchain source code that no one has found yet. But here's the thing. The source code isn't very big. If there were a vulnerability someone would have found it already, and if not, then something will replace bitcoin. Cryptocurrency is not a fad. I'm pretty fuckin sure that bitcoin is the currency of the people of the world. No bank can control us. No government can contain us. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:48:41

“Bitcoin represents a fundamental transformation of money. An invention that changes the oldest technology we have in civilization. That changes it radically and disruptively by changing the fundamental architecture into one where every participant is equal. Where transaction has no state or context other than obeying the consensus rules of the network that no one controls. Where your money is yours. You control it absolutely through the application of digital signatures, and no one can censor it, no one can seize it, no one can freeze it. No one can tell you what to do or what not to do with your money. It is a system of money that is simultaneously, absolutely transnational and borderless. We’ve never had a system of money like that.”

dont get me wrong, i have a stop loss, but we are far from it. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:14:31
healthcare would be cheaper without government intervention because of market forces that would drive prices down through competition, drive to innovate, etc. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:28:38
maybe a small correction but nothing we havent seen before. this is a revolution, not a get rich quick scheme. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:55:18
Its because blockchain is the greatest invention in human history that bitcoin is not a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:32:23
exactly! They are pitching it SO HARD...if it was a good idea it wouldn't need to be "sold." 2X just reeks of desperation for control, even though on the surface it sounds like a good idea. The implementation plan is just awful though. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:47:48

@_date: 2017-11-23 15:56:29

@_date: 2017-11-24 10:58:20
the amount of crypto scams is absolutely atrocious and the fact that they actually work on people is also equally messed up.

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:18:15
this is the third time a dip of this magnitude has happened in last few months and wont be the last. I wouldnt be too worried, the rally at the end has always been a good time.

Should you? No. Will you? Yep.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:02:05
It just doesn't work like that...cryptocurrencies run on consensus of the users and no overseer is necessary at all. You are trying to fold a pizza into a hoagie. They're just different. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:09:20
Me too. Not thankful for the USD conversion rate, or any of that, just Thanks for allowing me to have control of my wealth free from centralized corrupt banking cartels. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:40:06
invest? It's not a company like google or apple. It's an asset. You don't invest in bitcoin, you use bitcoin as a tool to secure and keep control of your wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:21:27
I don't. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:26:13

coinbase doesn't give you private keys. your coins are not actually yours on coinbase. you need to send to a wallet.

@_date: 2019-06-14 13:33:35
I'm happy you realize this. Any good idea a shitcoin has, if it's good enough can be deployed on, in, or around the bitcoin protocol. It's pretty neat.

@_date: 2019-06-27 07:59:14
yep, because thats the paradigm i'd rather view the market as. I dunno I just feel like thinking of a price in one bitcoin seems a bit unfair, because the price of a sat is what is really going to matter in the future and maybe sooner than we think.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:45:57
thats good news for us :)

Gotcha...so we are back to the original point. The most popular method to express one's speech to as many people as possible in the world censors speech based on political ideology and  sectionalism. Those who do not want to be a part of that break off and make their own platform, but the original platform and its ideology is so strong(in the network effect) that it can attack and condemn any competitor, effectively shutting it down through spreading false information and slander(with use of allied corporations, lobbyists, etc.) to prevent those who would otherwise use it, to instead not, if not outright shutting it down through government intervention. Sounds greeeeeeeat. If you don't see the problem here, then guess what...you are part of the problem.

Okay so since it's on coinbase there's no block chain transaction. Coinbase simply is supposed to release the funds. Be patient I know it's annoying. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:48
Yep. What's that have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:25:46
I think thats a conservative guess but hey! I'm happy with it.

Of course I would care. That is a big deal. I would study the theories for the reason and most likely keep buying in while its cheap. There is a certain element of idealism with me that is perfectly okay with losses if it means I actually was a part of something that COULD have been the revolution of the 21st century, even if it failed, I was part of the solution to a big problem in the world. I'm kind of a hippy anyway. Kids, my lifestyle is not recommended for the faint of heart, but you know, fortune favors the brave. 
Price stability will come in the coming years/decades. Until then, riding the wave. Whether up or down I believe in this technology.

@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:12
Its not a speculation...the dev community is extremely active. Bitcoin in 2011 do you know how incredibly difficult it was to buy? Do you know how incredibly annoying it was to secure a wallet.dat file? Bitcoin has already EVOLVED A LOT since those days, and in a good way. It's borderline braindead ignorant to spout that we cannot evolve any further. This is just the beginning and people like you need to be patient.

Bitcoin is both a giffen good and a Veblen good.A Giffen good is a product that people consume more of as the price rises and vice versa — seemingly in violation of basic laws of demand in microeconomics such as with substitute goods and the income effect.
Veblen goods are types of luxury goods for which the quantity demanded increases as the price increases in an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.
This article compares bitcoin to old world investments that are completely in a different class to bitcoin. It's almost pitiful how ignorant the premise is, comparing it to stocks. So unbelievably ignorant.

Bitcoin should NOT be considered an investment. The fundamental value of Bitcoin is that it represents a virtual medium of exchange. That means that it is a digital commodity that is primarily of practical value and not an investment

Value does not bring adoption. Adoption brings value. With that value, comes intelligent people, more innovators, more developers,   and greater growth. I am not a developer. I am just a believer.

Veblen goods are types of luxury goods for which the quantity demanded increases as the price increases in an apparent contradiction of the law of demand. Bitcoin fulfills both of these.

im with you man. BTC is brilliant because I can have complete control of my wealth and get it out of the clutches of the banking cartels. This is it's main purpose for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:08:13

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:02:01
well, right now its value comes from the borderless and secure means to store and transfer wealth. Bitcoin is my bank. It is more secure than any 3rd party bank, it is transferable, fungible, and does not need a 3rd trusted party to manage. That's it's current value. It's value as a currency will come, as the devs are working very hard to get scaling under control, and other upgrades. This is 1994 internet. You couldn't send photos in email when email first came out, doesn't mean email will always stay like that. same thing goes for bitcoin. I agree that it's not a stock or an investment and shouldn't be treated as such. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:40:19

first. i wouldn't call it an investment. I would call it depositing into a new asset class without the rules or annoyances of central banking or government. Second, I would convert it to btc and secure it with a paper wallet.

ISPs only have market power now because the government pins down startups and those with good ideas that could compete with the big boys through regulation. Giving government the keys to the castle is not only extremely irresponsible, but it is also just never a good idea. Let the market do its thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:44:51
I get this is the situation now... but if they lose control of the economy and of the banks because of this technological revolution. I don't know. I'm not TOO worried because I have my seed memorized, so if I can bail I can but shit...it's kind of freaky to think about. Some orwellian nightmare could happen when the elite realize they have no more control over currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:50:46
pretty much this, but i dont think of it as an investment anymore. I am my own bank. That's life changing.

free market man. may the best coin win. I am not a fanboy, but you better bet your ass my crypto portfolio % wise is vastly bitcoin because bitcoin is what all other cryptos are measured by. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:15:16
These topics are getting really tiresome. There may be a correction, which is normal for bitcoin. But there won't be a crash. Stop being dramatic. This is a new asset class that is just sprouting its baby wings. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:29:19
its not a risk at all. it is just another alt coin that further proves bitcoin's dominance because of the spreading of market cap. i hold all kinds of cryptocurrency(Dash, xrp, monero, ltc, etc), and if one of them proves better in the competition for market share than bitcoin (im really pulling for monero actually) then thats cool too. but the bitcoin devs know what theyre doing. they know that scaling is an issue that needs be solved CORRECTLY, unlike bcash.

Well, I don't see bitcoin as having a "price." Instead, I see fiat as a hyperinflationary bubble that is popping and bitcoin/fiat conversion rate is simply reflective of that. 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin. 1 dollar is 1 dollar. The regulatory agencies of the dollar is actively reducing the value of the dollar in order to keep the economy from crashing. Their measures are temporary and the dollar will die someday soon I think. With that said, I  am happy from simply knowing that my wealth is secure and outside of the banking cartel. Sure, if I ever need to convert back to fiat in an emergency I am happy knowing that the exchange rate has evolved in my favor, but that is not the main purpose bitcoin is used for at least to me.

Everything you just said is factually incorrect. The devs have no power without consensus. It is OPEN SOURCE.

If they were paid with money sourced by voluntary choice by individuals instead of the ineptitude and corruption of the government, then the market would have put them under for underperforming and a better higher quality business would take over. This is because market forces would decide to stop providing the "failed to deliver" company with money for services that were not rendered.  This is econ 101, man.

corrections, sure. not a "crash". Thats incredibly hyperbolic. speculators cash in to secure profits. thats going to happen as these early days continue. eventually the adoption rate will stabilize, lightning.network and other improvements will be implemented, and bitcoin will destroy all the fiat economies in an amazing revolution. and if bitcoin doesnt, monero or dash, or litecoin will be happy to improve the model. crypto will never crash.

no its much much more than that. with lightning network about to be released with much more user friendly setup, people will be rushing in to get free money through lightning fees, and transactions will be faster, etc. I am damn sure and damn ready to lose everything I have in betting that this is no where near the value of a bitcoin at maturity. No way. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:05:23
I mean. I could be wrong. I am prepared to lose everything on this. But I would be much less pissed losing the thousands I have converted into bitcoin now, than I will be in 10 years when I wish I did exactly that. The me from 10 years from now is telling me to get in on this. And that's what I'm doing. Rain or shine...if it fails, if it succeeds, this shit is the real deal.

Im a believer. if it dropped towards zero (it wont) I wouldnt be sad because I have lost a lot of wealth, I will be sad because humanity chose to not be financially free when given the chance. either way, I'd buy so much more because 1. fuck government fiat and more importantly 2. fuck the banks.

your answer is literally in the FAQ part on the amazon link you posted...
Question: So, as the private key never comes off of this device..what happens when it blows up/wears out ?
Answer: You would need a new TREZOR device that you could restore the lost info using your recovery seed. Recovery seed is a mnemonic code made of 12, 18 or 24 words depending on your choice. This seed is generated the first time you run TREZOR and will help you recovering it's contents (private keys, bitcoin balance and transaction history) into a new device if you lose your TREZOR. see less

You should not invest in bitcoin. This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. It is not an investment. Bitcoin is a new asset class with utility that bypasses governments and central banks. It is the most secure and easy way to transfer, store, and exchange wealth. If you do not think this will have value in your life I don't think you should get into it.

@_date: 2017-11-28 11:58:32
no. the goal is mainstream adoption. the exchange rate with baseless government fiat  matters not in this revolution in decentralization. as the exchange rate rises, the exchange rate becomes less and less relevant. This isn't and will never be a get rich quick scheme.

Ultra libertarian here. Banks and government are cancer 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:07:54
I am not going to get into partisan politics because I believe the entire system is smoke and mirrors for corporate technocrats, but it doesn't matter. It's human psychology. When the powerful can do nothing, they will lash out. I am not saying they won't. But they cannot ban this technology without crippling their economy when other countries are embracing it and thriving. They are in a lose-lose situation and I am enjoying every second of it. The smart thing to do for them would be to go to a full decentralized currency system and work with the blockchain devs on making it more mainstream. That would be the correct choice for the government. But, we all know the government always does the exact opposite of what they should in nearly every single decision. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:30:41

It is not about countries. It is about principles. If  an individual takes the property of another individual without the latter individual's consent, THAT IS THEFT(not even to mention a threat of force). Just because taxation is a GROUP of people using the threat of force (incarceration) to remove someone's property without their consent doesn't mean it's not wrong and not immoral. The fact that the stolen property may be spent on improving said victim's roads or whatever is not the point(especially if given the choice, the victim would pay their share of the roads voluntarily). The point is that if it's wrong for the individual to steal(it is), then it's wrong for a group of individuals to steal no matter how those individuals supposedly acquired the power to do so. Call it taxes if you want, there's no difference between taxation and theft other than in taxation, the ones doing the stealing are crooks that the majority hired to do the stealing. You say government. I say mafia.

It should be very obvious. Saying "Money of the internet" is implying that the internet is the platform for which this new money is built on top of. That is wrong. Bitcoin is a network unto itself, it is not the effect of an external network. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is perhaps a more clear illustration, however bitcoin is obviously the foundational network structure for this. Bitcoin does to finance as the Internet does to information. Git eet?

Why are we so incredibly intellectually lazy that all we can manage to do is beg nanny government to take control? We should put our big boy pants on and solve this issue in a way that doesn't compromise our values.

That's not what I meant AT ALL. I only said that to offset what I expected to be a few "don't spend, just hold!" responses... Of course I'm going to report, which is the whole pint of this post, to show how awesome cointracking.com is for tax purposes. Sheesh

Bitcoin is a savings technology. It should never be viewed as an investment. do you find value in having complete control over your wealth? then bitcoin is for you. If you are looking to somehow generate more garbage government fiat, then bitcoin is probably not for you. Stick to stocks, and negative interest rate bonds for that.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:36:19

what btc is about to me in order of importance:
1. safe, secure storage of wealth. I can be my own bank and not be worried of asset freezes, etc. 
2. Protection of wealth against inflation, and central bank shenanigans.
3. It's fun and exciting technology.
4. price

youre thinking of it wrong. bitcoin isnt investing, its being your own bank, while experiencing deflation rather than inflation in a safe, organic, peer to peer environment.

You dont get it. Bitcoin will replace fiat...fiat value will be measured next to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:52:37
I contribute to bitcoin by using correct words when talking about it. Like using convert instead of invest, or exchange instead of buy. The ignorance is real of these words so the newbies need to know.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:19:25
then itll be a long time discount. I'm fine with that too. Bitcoin is my bank. I have control. I won't give up on it.

Any time below $200,000/btc is probably good for long term. (5+ years)

This guy is a shit head troll who understands nothing. This isnt a fight over scaling. It's a fight over control. And it's not even much of a fight. It's actually so inconsequential that it's hardly worth talking about. Bcash is a forked shitcoin, just like the myriad of other bitcoin forks that no one takes seriously. For someone as God damn stupid as Peter McCormack, I'm shocked that he has such a large platform.

Thanks, makezee. You are right I am pretty newbie at this stuff...I discovered that there was about a 20gb chunk on my local 32gb stick for blocks, and there was even a chainstate folder, which is totally wrong. So I deleted those, and now that disk is nice and empty (14% instead of 100%). I don't know how  I got it to think the memory stick is where I want my bitcoin blockchain to be stored(might have something to do with -reindex), but I deleted it and I also deleted the blocks and chainstate out of my /mnt/hdd/bitcoin, and am currently transferring over a fresh sync'd copy of blocks and chainstate from my GUI node...I am hoping when that finishes it will all sync up again. It will take a few hours though.

Uh. Are you really so narrow minded that you think something like the current state of bitcoin, which is easily comparable to 1994 internet, is going to be the exact same with no development? Do you even crypto, bro? scaling solutions are in the works. lightning.network is very promising and will be more user friendly in the coming months/years for those who want to run it and collect an income doing it. nodes are being put up left and right. The problems you list are like saying in 1995 that your email can't send photos and that it never will be able to send photos. So narrow minded. Things evolve.

How is it based on violence? Are you fucking trolling me? NO GOVERNMENT IS BETTER THAN ANY GOVERNMENT. Institutionalized violence is WRONG. The rights of the minority are equally as important as a majority. Democracy is fucking evil. Communism is evil. Feudalism is evil. Monarchy is evil. Socialism is evil. The very concept of government when boiled down to the basic function is the purest of evil. You have no right to impose your mob rule on minorities and you're a prick for saying you do.

You realize the term cash is in reference to no middleman right? Like if you visit me and I hand you a $5 bill. The exchange is simple. It still has those properties. Have you read it? If I missed where it says "This will replace visa and mastercard" then please show me. And even if it does say that it doesn't matter. Even the great Satoshi can be wrong.

It might but the point of btcpay is there is no middle man. You would run btcpay on either a Linux vps or local system and connect through a subdomain. You could also use Microsoft azure but they charge a bit more than vps.

I agree, that's how society works. You are thinking in a box. My point is that society could be better in a voluntaryist mindset, where if an interaction between humans that is involuntary is the only crime. Aka... Initiation of force is a crime. That doesn't work in current society because all government is is the initiation of force. We can have rules without rulers.

Sorry man it's just damn frustrating. You've had answers to your questions over and over by some very smart folks on your podcast yet you keep asking the same questions. It's really weird. This whole battle over scaling narrative you're spreading is so skewed and divorced from reality it's really painful. I care about the newbies as well but when you frame the fork situation as a debate over scaling, rather than what it really is: a pathetic attempt at seizing control, it really makes me wonder what your agenda is. So in my estimation you're either stupid or have a motive to spread confusion. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and going with the former rather than the latter. 
Edit: just to add, if it truly was a debate over scaling, the forkers would have respect enough for bitcoin to start their own coin rather than attempt a hijack. This is the red flag that proves its not about scaling.

If you treat bitcoin as an investment you'll always be rekt. If you never sell and instead adopt the future, then the price swings don't affect you.

@_date: 2019-04-22 04:03:25
Exactly! It's apolitical. Why have we been arguing? It's completely devoid of politics... That's the whole point. It's an anarchy system of money. Anarchy means rules without rulers. Just like bitcoin. It's an Austrian system with ancap foundation. Glad you agree.

This is bitcoin, not crypto, whatever the hell that means.

I used to be addicted to price checking until I became addicted to the tech, specifically optimizing bitcoind, lnd, btcpayserver, etc. Much healthier obsession than price.

I don't understand this mentality at all
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:06:36
People are starting to know I'm a bitcoiner at work and if they ask with genuine curiosity I'll give them a resource to start them down the path. If they don't want to put in the effort then I don't care. If on the other hand they come at me like I'm some kind of an idiot all I say is they're right bitcoin is dumb. They're shocked when I don't pitch it like a pyramid scheme. I straight up say yeah bitcoin is totally stupid don't get any now f off.

So therefore institutionalized violence is your best solution? Fuck off scumbag. You have no right to coerce and threaten peaceful people, nor do you have the right to vote for tyrants to threaten and coerce a peaceful minority on your behalf. Get mental help.
@_date: 2019-04-20 04:15:06
Do you enjoy telling others how to live their life? No wonder you're a statist. Why do you think institutionalized violence is an appropriate way to organize society? Or are you just an asshole?
@_date: 2019-04-07 08:03:53
 I prefer to work for my satoshis but it's not about what I prefer..  it's about avoiding shitty companies, and coinbase...ahem...shitbase is near the top of the shit pile.
@_date: 2019-04-20 15:18:40
Answer my question then you can ask one. Also try to refrain from fallacies. Explain how mob rule is in any way fair or valid or moral for a society. Even Jefferson hated democracy. Why do you support tyrannical forms of institutionalized violence? Id much prefer no system at all  than a tyrannical one.

You have positioned yourself targeting the newbie niche. This isnt bad. It's good marketing and good business sense. But there's a responsibility there that I'm sure you're aware of. I apologize for being insulting. Just don't fall for the forkers claim it's about scaling. Even they may believe it but they only do because of the leadership apparatus. Ver and Jihan couldn't care less about scaling. The now shamed 2xers couldn't care less about scaling. It's control and power. Scaling is the topic used as the smokescreen fake conflict to sucker in newbies and folks that don't have the time or inclination to do their own research. I know there are strong opinions all around, but our goal as good people dedicated to decentralized economics should be to find the facts in the sea of bullshit, not add more shit to the sea. Thanks and sorry again. Also promoting blockfi is similar to promoting bitconnect. Let's be honest about that.

Thanks...I actually just found the issue. I don't really understand why, but I deleted it. I am copying over a fresh blocks and chainstate to my /mnt/ drive and i deleted the huge file in my memory stick. When the blockchain finishes transfering (in about 5 hours), I will re run everything and see if it syncs. I think the issue was bitcoind was trying to install blocks on my memory stick and not the mounted drive for some reason (probably my fault). I deleted it and now I know for sure I am copying over on my /mnt/hdd/ ...we will see if it works.
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:32:43

@_date: 2018-11-28 01:47:04
Right 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:22:15
Predicting inflation is more meaningful. That's why bitcoin is more stable as more hold it, and that's why people spend USD about as fast as they get it. It's not predictable. All fiat currencies inevitably inflate themselves to death sooner or later. Debt based economies always die eventually. Usually quickly and horribly.

Satoshi nakamoto is the first known entity to solve decentralizated double spending. The solution was not blockchain. The solution was proof of work and sha cryptography. Blockchain is a main stream meme. There is no ceo or leading face is another component more important than "blockchain" which existed before bitcoin

You are right it's not common knowledge. I stand corrected. You get to the point where you realize anything other than bitcoin will fail over a long process of self study and immersion. Don't worry though, everyone gets there eventually.

Why does it matter? People buy millions of electric blankets a year that are arguably worthless. No one is complaining about that.

At least tree fiddy

thankfully we have something called difficulty adjustment.

I'd say the iq of the idiot who put his savings in at ath is the one in question 
@_date: 2018-11-11 06:21:53
Consolidation period does not = bear market. Also blockchain is a meme.
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:48:27
Hahaha, I meant it is free to participate in(in terms of the ability, not the cost). Doofus. go to lopp.net/bitcoin.html and start learning. You are not convincing anyone that you are intelligent with your tired and boring comments.
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:29:30
The left right and rep dem paradigm is a psychological trap by design to provoke tribalistic rivalries when there is no true difference. A person is smart. But people are dumb. Politics is a tool to control the masses. Opt out.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:09:21
someone shared this with me the other day. *shrug* 
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:12:57
blockchain is a meme. bitcoin is much more than that. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:03:19
Okay. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:15:28
No it doesn't. It's deflationary. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:48:47
easily doable imo. i think around 80-110tril market cap we will start measuring fiat in bitcoin and not the other way around, which is the way it should be anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:22:22
lambos for all!
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:44:15
I have a better game. Let's guess the inflation rate of the USD and btc one month from now. What's more predictable again? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:42:31
I have no obligation to do so. If you truly desired to learn you'd invest time into doing so. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:17:42
HAHAAHAHA epic 10/10 trolling, man. good job. hahaha
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:47:51
Okay, thanks. That's great. Here's a cookie.
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:57:00
I feel sorry for you...having such a narrow view of something so beautiful 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:07:37
Your ideas intrigue me 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:55:44
Haha I am so excited!!!! As long as the protocol is still working, there is never too low! Going to scoop up a shit ton
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:47:33
Then you will get exactly what you deserve. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 12:45:39
without proof of work and crytographic hashing it wouldnt exist either. these are two examples of components of bitcoin that are much more important than the blockchain meme. I suggest you educate yourself a bit. "blockchain" is not special.
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:11:13
i dont waste my time with shitcoins, honestly
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:16:56
Ever hear of mtgox? We already learned this lesson. Stop endorsing irresponsible practices please. And you dumbasses down voting me and btcforever need to educate yourselves.
@_date: 2018-11-02 19:42:44
Eclair maybe 
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:28:44
you clearly dont understand. thats okay maybe someday.
@_date: 2018-11-18 11:29:07
This is not a get rich scheme. If you think like it is you will get burned. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:20:38
Okay. I'll continue to warn people against the snake oil you and other fools shill. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:46:46
Just ahead of the curve. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:42:58
$10000 worth at what date and time? Just say the bitcoin amount for fucks sake. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:57:39
It's called long term thinking. Those with high intelligence know the benefit. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:14:19
grats. I just bought more and brought my dollar average down a lot. So grats to us both! 
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:51:52
thats okay. by that time hyperinflation will have destroyed fiat around the world. that will be a great day for some, a horrible day for many more. regardless, cant make an omelette without cracking a few eggs.

@_date: 2018-11-25 21:06:32
Me too man
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:01:42




You wouldn't. Just like with any other form of transferable value on the planet, it is not accepted everywhere.




Thanks for the amazing questions, Dave.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:26:37
Do you have nothing better to do? 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:10:18
Only the ones that matter. The rest is just to stoke the tribalism 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:07:41
I'm still not even close to close to my goal... That sweet 1mil club... 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:29:22
It's not a currency. It's money. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:21:51
It's free. No one bestows anyone permission to participate. You don't have the slightest inkling of what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:05:48
Money badger will eat the idiots. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:24:08
bitcoin is money 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:13:06
Great :)
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:05:52
Price doesn't matter. Only network functionality matters. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:57:18
Oh you don't have to believe me at all. I am not making an argument. You will discover the truth yourself in time. Have fun.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:48:46
even a broken clock is correct twice a day
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:59:37
you can create more decimal spots with a hard fork. im sure if its absolutely necessary the consensus will be achieved, but that day is decades away, maybe a century or more away.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:44:49
yeesh this really scared me so i checked my wallets. didnt notice any dropped bitcoin, i have just as much as i expected. What is this "dropping" you speak of?
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:07:13
Did. Brought my DCA down a lot. Pretty happy 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:51:19
+1 ...This is not a get rich quick scheme. NO ONE ever said it was who had any merit in the community. With that said, I am still accumulating. Money of the future, baby. :)
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:34:55
average people dont adopt early. its okay.
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:14:51
the USA is such an authoritarian shithole these days
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:49:41
This is baseless FUD. it's very easy to find out if a Satoshi is real or not 
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:04:46
Which part? the 0 or the 10mil part?
@_date: 2018-11-18 16:43:13
The word blockchain is a meme 
@_date: 2018-11-03 07:22:10
King of the shitcoins? Maybe. XRP is tough competition in that field though. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:19:21
That's even worse. Bircoin not only has to exist but be at a million by Dec 2020...
@_date: 2018-11-24 07:07:58
Voorhees is worse than ver. At least ver never sold out to the state 
@_date: 2018-11-20 06:06:43
Thanks to dollar cost averaging it's only a 8%  correction for me. So there! 
@_date: 2018-11-09 15:20:16
I mean... Neither those links or your post provided any examples of racist behavior from the guy. Also I prefer video please. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:50:29
who would hold all year to 6000 only to dump it at below 5000? Thats what i dont get. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:14:14
It's backed by math 
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:20:32
The s at the end marks plural. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:36:49
Gotta catch em all man. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:09:46
I want it to go to zero. That would mean fiat is worthless when compared to bitcoin and we can finally be free of the banking cartel. At that point exchanges will die off and the only way for people to have a Satoshi will be to work and earn it. Dollars will be toilet paper.
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:44:36
i mean sure, if you dont care about privacy knock yourself out. ill stick to bisq
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:45:26
hopefully later. i need more accumulation time!
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:43:01
Bitcoin isn't a stock you stupid fuck
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:30:41
please god stay below 4000 as long as possible...MUST ACCUMULATE. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 07:32:47
I'm with you guys! 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:00:08
network improvements, the utility will become clear eventually. email wasnt useful to most people in 1990 either. this is a 20+ year project. probably 100+ year
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:43:01
Lol you're delusional then. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 06:55:36
better question: why are you using blockchain wallet when you could use an actual wallet where you control your keys and not have to worry about "sending failing?"
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:43:30
almost all shitcoins have no use for their coins, they are more like a really shitty fund raising source, which the tokens then have no use or purpose. The ONLY altcoin that isn't supposed to compete with bitcoin but actually have a use that i can find is POWR, which I believe in long term.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:11:56
Recovery key, bozo. What you use if you lose your wallet to recover it. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:09:30
Doesn't make it untrue. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:52:50
75.8% now. wowza
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:22:43
There are many benefits. Censorship resistant and global transfer without a third party is huge utility to name two
. Deflationary and transparent are two more.
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:56:47
"English man prefers English culture in England. Therefore, Racism! Fascist!" Really? Do you even know what that word means? Do you know how immature you come off with that sort of low IQ demonstration? You're one of those NPCs who I keep hearing about aren't you?
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:05:36
The 5mil --&gt; 500k crash will be pretty funny too. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 07:15:00
I like them because I'm okay with a nice bear market for accumulation purposes but whatever. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:10:38
That's why smart people DCA into the dip at set intervals in small amounts. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:03:37
I hate this jackass but I hate the government more. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:10:43
You're not thinking future like I am. I don't care about today or tomorrow. 2030 talk to me 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:10:04
+/- 2% for 90 days is my current working idea. If that happens I'll have to evaluate from there. But at least that before I try to spend. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:19:19
you only lose if you sell bro

@_date: 2018-11-09 18:49:35
Well. You're the one making the claim yet have no evidence in any capacity. Further, your liberal use of insults further cements the weakness of your position. I have no choice but to not be persuaded by your argument. Good luck with your rhetorical endeavors in the future though. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:46:45
congratulations! Today was payday and I got a bonus so I just bought another full bitcoin to add in the stash also. :)
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:25:29
Make sure you hold your own keys. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:10:44
No true scottsman fallacy. Nice. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:47:50
oh, so you actually plan on converting back to hyperinflationary monopoly money. Suit yourself i guess. I don't even think like that anymore
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:08:56
There won't be a death cycle unless the network is catastrophically compromised. The health of the network is not based on arbitrary fiat exchange rates.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:24:43
to add to this, the big name wallet developers will definitely upgrade. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:47:39
A whole bitcoin is within reach of most people again...the 21 mil club is a good place to be!
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:43:15
Good. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 01:52:58
no you don't. bitcoin already is a payment processing system. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:03:02
I know exactly how much bitcoin is created every 10 minutes. No one knows how much to that certainty with any other money type. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:13:53
Great. Some people recognize the banking cartel for what it is and participate in decentralized, free alternatives instead. You do you.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:09:43
It's money 
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:49:14
Is it custodial 
@_date: 2019-01-17 22:00:50
yeah...this guy was irresponsible. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:10:27
now it says 0 balance with no history. when i click add an account it says i cant. i have no idea whats going on.

@_date: 2018-11-23 09:54:05
If people are freaking out about this cycle then the 400k--&gt;50k drop is going to be hilarious
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:12:49
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:44:52
Wouldn't that cause value increase 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:32:40
well, subjective for sure. my definition of cheap is under $10000, but everyone is different. Obviously
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:31:26
im just happy to bring my DCA as low as possible. 150tril market cap for bitcoin is my long term goal. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:45:32
Okay. Thanks for going off topic. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:04:35
good point
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:02:01
Why don't you download bisq yourself and check it out? It's awesome 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:27:55
Okay since you can't respond in a meaningful way I'll let your ignorant keynesianism sit in its failure.

Then you should be wanting to get off of crapbase asap. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:02:51
i tried that and reinstalling the app and now it says that i have a 0 balance with no history at all...hmm..
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:45:04
Bingo. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 10:47:16
Expensive is a subjective term. I have two trezors and two ledger nanos. I think they are good value.

I'm not investing. I'm converting. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:18:37
I meant, the USD value of the paper the monopoly money is printed on, etc. however many pennies that is.
@_date: 2019-01-12 05:59:28
i use it daily. shrug. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:48:44
sadly, i started in sept 2017, during the dip around sept 8, i bought high. held through, been accumulating since. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:22:14
It's simply converting from  currency into money. It's not an investment and I don't see it as such. Simply exchanging currency for money. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:45:03
sudo fsck /dev/sda says is mounted...
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:07:24
Oh. I don't convert my bitcoin back to paper so I guess if you're doing that go for it 
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:48:42
Very interesting

is it easy to carry a gold coin in your brain though?
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:28:45
Woah easy there. Blockchain is a meme.

Woah there. You will do what the masters say. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:28:50
so the only option in your mind is to confiscate under violence (threat of incarceration) to provide for those that truly need help, because what, you don't think that charities exist? Since you love percents it seems, tell me, out of the taxes that go towards government assistance to the needy, what % of those taxes go towards "administration" costs and what % actually go to those in need? Further, what % of charity donation actually go to the needy compared to the % that goes towards administration. I will wait. Government is cancer of the human condition.
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:31:01

@_date: 2018-11-28 07:59:55
Use local bitcoins or bisq then 
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:09:01
My advice just do it. It's just stupid magic internet money not a big deal. If it was a big deal the government would have rules on the books by now 
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:18:40
I believe. I always ask at restaurants, etc. if they accept bitcoin yet whenever I buy something. Emphasis on the yet. Implants a thought that they will someday. Little by little... 
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:55:41
It's called the 21mil club but good job! The next milestone is 2.1, for the 10mil club. Never sell.

Good way to empower the black market... Errrr I mean free market. I approve. Seriously though if it's not voluntary then how do you enforce it?
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:29:56
Okay. I will do this after some sleep and send the log your way if that's okay. I am learning a lot so I appreciate the help. I will reply back again in a few hours.

I did it! I Am running a full node! After a couple weeks of screwing around with my network trying to accept incoming connections on my node, I decided to call my ISP...they sent out a tech and the tech basically just called a guy and they remotely turned their box into bridge mode, and now I have 12+ connections! So...should I run this through a VPS/VPN? Thinking vultr+openvpn...just for extra security? Next...I have a raspberry pi and I am going to keep learning ubuntu terminal. The future is looking good.
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:47:55
last a checked a bitcoin was still worth a bitcoin so i dont know what you are rambling about. nothing has changed. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:19:21
Why do these clowns think "blockchain" is a big deal? Serious question. "blockchain" isn't what makes bitcoin special.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:50:55
Heck I'd even inquire an unprofessional one. I'm really curious about this. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:41:22

@_date: 2018-03-20 20:19:24
the REAL PSA: DONT USE CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES. Instead, get on bisq and start getting your zelle set up. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 21:03:59

No one is forcing anyone to work for anyone. Go on strike if you don't like your job. It's voluntary. Suck it up or quit. I work 10 hours a day at a job that took me thousands of hours of studying and then hundreds of hours of applying and interviewing to achieve. The fruits of my labor are the fruits of my labor. My property. If someone doesn't like the state of living they are in...they can go to the library, get on the internet, and learn something useful to be able to market themselves to an employer or self start. If they have some sort of disability then there are plenty of helpful organizations for those people out there. It just takes effort. Lazy yet capable people should not be rewarded, yet they are rewarded because politicians know that the vote of a lazy person is worth the same as a vote for someone who busts their ass and want the lazy demographic to vote for them because lazy people love free stuff. but its not free. its the wealth the government stole from me. they use it to get free stuff to lazy people to get them to vote to confiscate more wealth from me to get more free stuff. its disgusting.

Corporations exist BECAUSE of the state! Your thinking is completely backwards. Competition does not exist in the current corporatist system because THE STATE allows monopolies and price gauging through corporate welfare, backroom deals, and tax breaks that the little guy doesn't get to have. The removal of the state, and with it the removal of intellectual property, patents, etc. will encourage competition, innovation, and keep prices low. The state is the single greatest threat to human progress and is a cancer to civilization. Bitcoin is destined to remove the control of finance from the state in time, and hopefully light the fuse that will dismantle the state forever as people slowly realize they can do better without it.

I don't believe that it is morally okay to walk to your neighbor, and demand their wallet from them against their will. I assume you don't either. Great. I also don't believe that it is morally okay for me to get together with a few other neighbors, to take the wallet of the other neighbor since we outnumber them. You do. This is voting. This is democracy. THIS is tyranny. You use the power of majority to steal from those who want to be left alone. People who vote are either indoctrinated fools who think they are free, or they know the truth and do it anyway, which simply makes them scumbags. So which are you, buddy?

I followed the guide up until this point perfectly with no issue...so I did it like this: 
Mounting external hard disk
To store the blockchain, we need a lot of space. As a server installation, the Linux native file system Ext4 is the best choice for the external hard disk, so we will format the hard disk, erasing all previous data. The external hard disk is then attached to the file system and can be accessed as a regular folder (this is called “mounting”).
⚠️ Previous data on this hard disk will be deleted!
Plug your hard disk into the running Pi and power the drive up.
Get the NAME for main partition on the external hard disk
$ lsblk -o UUID,NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,LABEL,MODEL
Format the external hard disk with Ext4 (use [NAME] from above, e.g /dev/sda1)
$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/[NAME]
Copy the UUID that is provided as a result of this format command to your local (Windows) notepad.
Edit the fstab file and the following as a new line (replace UUID=123456) at the end
$ sudo nano /etc/fstab
UUID=123456 /mnt/hdd ext4 noexec,defaults 0 0
Create the directory to add the hard disk and set the correct owner
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/hdd
Mount all drives and check the file system. Is “/mnt/hdd” listed?
$ sudo mount -a
$ df /mnt/hdd
Filesystem     1K-blocks  Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1      479667880 73756 455158568   1% /mnt/hdd
Set the owner
$ sudo chown -R bitcoin:bitcoin /mnt/hdd/
Switch to user "bitcoin", navigate to the hard disk and create the bitcoin directory.
$ sudo su - bitcoin
$ cd /mnt/hdd
$ mkdir bitcoin
$ ls -la
Create a testfile in the new directory and delete it.
$ touch bitcoin/test.file
$ rm bitcoin/test.file
Exit the "bitcoin" user session
$ exit

i think the 10mil is more likely than the 0. the only way we go to zero is if there is an exploit found that somehow destroys the entire network. Or, the only other way we go to zero is if bitcoin stops being valued in fiat all together, which is more likely that the former.

Apparently there's a fix in 0.5.1. I am running 0.5.0. I'm trying to find a guide to update it but having a hard time finding one. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:06:35
First, it's simple. In a free society, intelligent people and groups will be incentivized to develop and propose solutions that do not involve coercion, violence, extortion, etc. that the current despotic system mandates. The environment for innovation needs to be fostered to solve these problems. We do not have the environment right now. My role is not to solve every minute little question you have about specific situations and how they would be solved in a free society. I am not some genius, and I am flattered that you actually think I am apparently. My role is to explain that if we create an environment where free thinkers and innovators can thrive(abolishment of the ruling class, and society predicated around violent coercion), then these issues will be solved. Second, you are living in a fantasy world with that one. Monopolies are a symptom of the cancer that is government and corporatism. Free societies inherently foster constant competitive business environment. When you get rid of intellectual property law and the corrupt patent system, competition will thrive, and monopolies would not be able to occur. Third, see answer to   This is called voluntaryism, or anarchocapitalism. Google them and check it out. The ideas in those philosophies are much better in every single way to the current dictatorial ruling-class based systems. You are on the bitcoin subreddit for crying out loud. DECENTRALIZE ALL THE THINGS. That's the bitcoin way. And bitcoin doesn't care what statists think :)

Here's my final point. I've opened the door for you. If you want to actually study, that's your choice.
Anarchy can be viewed as a cure for cancer and heart disease, not a prescription for endlessly perfect health. It would be unreasonable to oppose a cure for cancer because such a cure did not eliminate all other possible diseases—in the same way, we cannot reasonably oppose a stateless society because some people are bad, and a free society will not make them good.

Is there a way to see the BTC dominance % but only in relation to the top 100 coins/tokens by market cap? Or top 50? Is there anywhere I can customize the BTC dominance range?

It's my understanding that with those 8 all I am doing is keeping my own copy of the ledger updated. I am not helping others keep theirs updated, which is what I want to do.  in the debug menu it says 8(In:0 Out:8) Furthermore, if I can't figure this out I will be unable to  have an operable lightning node, which is my ultimate goal. I need to figure out how to do this....I am really surprised I can't figure it out even with the help of the internet and multiple websites where I have begged for help with this issue for many days now. Until bitnodes recognizes my node, I have work to do. So that's the goal.

question about this part: "If you just let your bitcoin sit, it could go to a million per BTC but that would be untaxed "unrealized" gain, until you sold it. Unless you're renouncing your citizenship, of course. Then the IRS has no problem taxing your unrealized gain because you won't be around to tax the actual gain later." How would they even know I held BTC in my trezor?
@_date: 2018-11-13 09:35:03
Okay. When I hover over the little symbol in the bottom right corner to the right of "HD" it says "8 active connections to bitcoin network" so I guess I didn't need to forward anything. On bitnodes it says I can enter an IP address to see if my node is in the network. Is this address found in the client somewhere?

i am interested to get into exchanges...so I would like to piggy back on this post and also ask, which exchange is best to do timed buying selling? I would like to put in something like If 3300, buy 3, if $4500 sell 2. something like that and let it be automatic.

Yeah but thinking of BTC as an investment can be emotional and stressful. 1btc = 1btc is the healthiest mindset in this space. this mindset has allowed me to hodl strong. instead of focusing on the fiat value in terms of selling, I look at it as spots to add to my stash. Besides that, it is much more fun to focus on learning more about the tech every day and participating. The best advice is to wash the idea from your mind of ever converting back to fiat.

Thanks... I scrolled through looking for quotes or backup evidence for the claims. Nothing at all though. Just unsubstantiated hyperbole in that piece. I tend to not be persuaded that way. Real evidence requested. Edit:you know in bitcoin we have a phrase "don't trust verify" I live that phrase these days. I don't trust tabloid news nor can I verify their claims. So why should I get angry like you are over fantasy?

Bitcoin is probably more important and revolutionary than the internet but it is AT LEAST as revolutionary. Internet changed the way humans share and absorb information. Bitcoin does the same with money and banking. It's disruptive of the status quo  in the most beautiful way. It has the potential to render the bsnking system obsolete. That's very exciting.

I did not...I am contemplating it though. I need to buy some extra zip ties to put it back. Is it possible the user.pass is saved in custom firmware and I will be unable to figure it out? I am 100% sure I factory reset the thing but none of the default user/pass works.
edit: I called hotwire again and they said they will send a tech out to get me the user/pass and/or help me allow pass-through on their ZTE machine...they will come on Tuesday so we will see if that helps. I got a feeling they will call me crazy, say that I am not allowed access to the ZTE F668 and laugh on the way out though. A networking pro coworker of mine told me last night it's probably possible to use cloud server like vultr, using ubuntu and open vpn to tunnel through the local NAT though but that was just talk for now. worst case scenario i will try it(with his help because i dont know crap about linux)

what if instead of selling bitcoin, one simply trades bitcoin for a plastic spoon, that one then sells to someone for a price that may or may not be close to the exchange rate of the amount in fiat that said trade was worth? then is it sales tax?

@_date: 2017-09-17 11:31:01
okay, so if i buy BTC, keep it as BTC, and put it into my hardware wallet, its fine until i decide to convert it. But if I use my BTC address to buy something, then theres some sort of tax that I have to keep a record of for tax return. Isn't that sales tax? BTC is anonymous so how is this even trackable?

@_date: 2018-11-06 16:37:47
Your first point, maybe. Your second point makes no sense. The difficulty will simply go down. How are you an enthusiast (i refuse to say investor, bitcoin is not an investment) and still not know this? Price doesn't matter. Bitcoin will always exist. Fiat conversion means nothing. By that time a lot of services and products will have base SAT prices, most likely. Fiat will die.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:19:53
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:03:45
i bought a lot at about same prices as you, but when i did i took a deep breath and i told myself im in it until one of three things happens:
1. BTC becomes the world currency or there is a similar anti-fiat revolution
2. BTC reaches $100,000
No regrets.

If you are calling it an investment, I think you should research enough until you gain the epiphany that one does not "invest" in bitcoin. One adopts it. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. People have got rich from it, sure. But that was not the point at its birth. If you are buying bitcoin to hold, in anticipation of using it in transactions later as the coming layers get developed, implemented, etc. then that is the right reason. Investment? Honestly, I am tired of "investors" in bitcoin. These "investors" panic sold, fell for FOMO, thought it was a get rich quick scheme, and lost on the way down. This is not the point. Buy penny stocks if you are into that.

It's like you totally forget that charities are a thing. You can still have incentives to make charitable donations. You forget that choice is what matters. I don't choose to fund the military but it happens. I don't choose to pay for studying ants on treadmills but it happens. I don't choose to fund social security because I don't plan on using it.  Let me choose and maybe I wouldn't be so annoyed.

im opposed to any interaction between individuals that involves either party using coercion to get their intended result.

no TLDR...I'll just say for me its simply because its freedom to be your own bank, and your money not be affected by the hidden tax of inflation.  Even if it fails, its the best damn currency concept and implementation in human history and I will have no regrets. If it fails it because humanity is too dumb to participate in their own growth as a species not because it was a bad idea.

i already say satoshis
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:05:40
as hard as i try to understand it, i cant, so i might just sell and get rid of it all since its so unnecessarily complicated to understand. It used to be simple. A bitcoin was a bitcoin. It was acquired by solving problems via mining, and the ledger was authenticated by miners, and transactions were instant and easy. Now...what the fuck even is this shit...
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:19:28
oh yeah? definitely will look into that

yeah lots of ideas.

umm yay?

i thought bitcoin was the casino ;)
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:09:48
perfect. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:29:28
If you think that the only way to provide those conveniences are through the iron fist of government, then you need to use that mush between your ears a little bit. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:59:02
it...begins. What is the deadline to have BTC before the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:49:38
dont ask others what to do with your money...that's irresponsible. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:08:33
uhh... thats a lot of information. I just buy and hodl. *shrug* 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:47:15
to clarify, i mean bank account USD --&gt; BTC . 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:14:45
I don't quite understand what you are saying, but when I hear "National health service," "Free education," and "Safety net" I think of government dictating other peoples lives from confiscating wealth from others which I am very actively fighting against. To call government control of these things "civilized" is hilarious to me.  So...yeah. See ya on the battlefield of ideas I guess. As for crypto, I'm hoping fiat dies as much as you likely do as well as anything centralized. Decentralize all the things.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:03:59
another side note, don't mistake...its very possible for society to have rules absent an elite ruling class. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:16:31

@_date: 2018-07-16 11:53:38
Why quotes? You think the ruling class is interested in decentralized technology or more interested in perverting it to maintain or  enhance their iron grip on civilization? 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:49:48
then you will face the punishment. are you trying to seem smart? Because you seem idiotic. civilization can have rules without a all powerful ruling class to subjugate it.

the whole point is no regulation. regulate my dick. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:42:15
If you believe taxation is not theft then you are not libertarian, in any way shape or form. There are great libertarian philosophers such as Spooner and Rothbard that would laugh at you.  Do you know what the non aggression principle is? It is the cornerstone of libertarianism. You need to actually read instead of assuming...
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:13:00
Just backs up what everyone has been saying...get your goddamn BTC off of the exchange. Also fyi, BTC Gold and B2X is different.

i think its about time the governments of the world started being taxed by the people. see how they like it the greedy fucks. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:05:14
I see it as a hedge against the fucked up concept known as government.

How could it end? Why is it happening at all?

anecdote as evidence that a ruling elite is necessary to pave concrete. check. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:50:12
Since you're poking the bear. BTC is it's own thing. USD is used as a measure of value on it because it is not even close to being widely adopted yet. Once it is, it won't need the USD to be used as a measuring point. BTC will just be BTC and the market will adapt and regulate how many satoshis is worth what. You need to educate yourself on what bitcoin is. it needs fiat just about as much as your body needs cancer. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:30:58
we are way over last month too. people are crazy if they think this is a big deal. i wont even care if it goes back to 4500. still not a big deal. we are up HUGE for the year.

How are you so sure of this statement? What evidence do you have that makes this statement true?


The market. Other social services can be provided by with organized charity organizations and donations. Now you explain why you think taxes are the better option than choice. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:59:10
I know what bitcoin is but.. what is "crypto" ?
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:42:32
right...thats why its a principle not a theory. lmao slow much

get out? This is just the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:39:05
haha....ill sell at $50,000 until then...well...maybe $100k but hopefully by then fiat will be dead and i wont have to sell it at all. that is the dream i guess. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:53:34
from that site "Bill earns $60,000/year. He buys 1 Bitcoin for $10 on March 1, 2013 and sells it on November 29th, 2013 for $1,000. The cost basis of the coin was $10 with a 0.5% fee, $10.05. The sale income also had a 0.5% transaction fee, so was in total $995. Therefore his capital gain was $995 - $10.05 = $984.95. Since he owned the coin for a year or less, he reports short term capital gains on his tax return the following year. The gain is added to his existing income and is taxed at his ordinary tax rate of 28%, so he pays $984.95 * 0.28 = $275.79 in additional taxes." ....that is goddamn robbery 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:11:12
how can it not mean anything? If the transaction happens from legacy chain to the forked chain, or vice versa isnt that an issue?

It all comes down to centralization VS decentralization. I agree with his position when the currency is centralized. Decentralized currency is a new concept and one I welcome the future of.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:55:09
I usually buy $500 of btc every other friday from coinbase then xfer to trezor once its complete,  but I am kind of nervous now that we are near the fork and want to make sure my btc stays pure.

All I do know is that we as a species can do better than institutionalized violence. Smarter people than me can figure out the nuances as the notion of government becomes obsolete over the coming decades/centuries. Like Feudalism, it will die. I see nothing wrong with greed, it's forcing others to give you their life and property that is immoral. Individual property rights is the foundation of a free society. Look no further than property taxes to understand the fact that no American truly owns their home. This is scary. But what is even scarier is people accept it because they were taught to roll over to arbitrary authority. It's a real shame. There is no better slave than the slave that believes they can be nothing other than a slave.

But it isn't permission-less or censorship resistant.  The way the world is progressing, privacy is more and more of an issue for the average person. Further, we have about 4 billion unbanked people on the planet, who do not have access to first world institutions, yet they have access to a solar panel atena and a nokia to get their local weather. They can also use this solar panel and atena to keep their wealth safe by being their own bank with bitcoin. You don't really have the vision or understanding of the importance of this technology yet. And that's okay. Most people don't. It takes a special kind of person to actually see the future...maybe you will see it too with more study. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:59:24

@_date: 2017-10-30 11:27:33
Everyone buys bitcoin for their own reason. I buy and I hold because I believe that the big banks and federal reserve that run the currency in the USA (Don't tell me the treasury does because thats bullshit since widrow wilson), are corrupt manipulators and after reading the creature from jekyll island (amazing book about the creation of the federal reserve), I am happy to know that crypto may be a valid alternative someday. It's not now. No one says it is now. But I hope more and more the people of the planet realize that having a 21st century economy try to fit 17th century political ideas is a recipe of disaster for governments. They cannot keep up with this growth in technology, and I am betting on the future. A future with a government not involved with money and we have systems of decentralization to rip the power away from these evil jackasses who require our subjugation to be rich. Side note, I am sick and tired of the tax of inflation. Bitcoin allows me to be my own bank, and I always sleep well knowing my money is safe because I keep control of it. 
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:26:48

No attachment to an institution or body is what makes it appealing. The state propaganda is strong... 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:18:47
Get into details? What do you think I am some kind of einstein of social planning? I want to create an environment where the smart people can solve these problems in a free society. You thinking I have the answer to every minute detail is another example of how idiotic you are. Taxes are as much a choice as handing your wallet over to someone with a knife at your throat is a choice. It's a bullshit choice. To your "law" point, you can have rules without rulers. This notion that you need to empower individuals to rule over everyone in order to have order is absolutely ridiculous and part of the indoctrination system that the government funds through those taxes. Finally,


and fiat used to be the best way to trade value, until bitcoin. We are in a 21st century economy operating on ARCHAIC and I mean VERY ARCHAIC political ideas. These things don't mesh, and you shouldn't be so scared of the future. Taxation is an old idea. Regulation is an old idea. GOVERNMENT is an old idea. We can do better. That's a goddamn fact. Shit, the concept of intellectual property alone has set our species back probably centuries. Government (in all its forms) is anathema to human progress. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:12:32

@_date: 2017-10-21 19:21:07
put a larger amount of fiat aside for possible dips to help cost averaging, but keep the conversion steady. I have $1500 sitting aside for any dips, but still slap $250/week or so into btc regardless of price. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:58:35
you actually dont need taxes for any of that.  Tell me why we NEED taxes. Those examples you provided can not only exist, but be better when it isnt funded by confiscated property by the state.

we have a 21st century economy with 17th century political ideas(John Locke, etc). They were good ideas at the time of Jefferson but we need to move on.  We need to decentralize every possible thing and strip governments to the barest of bones for human liberty and innovation and the continuing advancement of our species. I feel for my friends fighting for freedom in Catalonia and hope they win their liberty.

I'm adopting a new currency. Nothing more nothing less. If I was 100% sure that the fiat conversion rate would stay the same for years and years I'd still accumulate. The utility of bitcoin is what gives it value to me.

@_date: 2017-09-15 18:43:51
i hear trezor is good, but im a newbie and just bought BTC lst week, (about .5 worth) I was looking at hard storage, but its kind of confusing. I think I have to send it from BTC to electronic storage like ELECTRUM and then to my trezor...something like that. idk. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:57:00
It has a government?? Pass.

Just liquidate and buy
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:38:02
Haha yeah...Been doing it for a while though so I am used to it. By "many wallets" you mean many addresses right? I can create new addresses on my ledger nano and monero GUI pretty easily, so I just want to make sure you mean addresses.
@_date: 2018-07-11 06:06:24
well duh

Thatd be awesome. Cheaper please.

Because diversifying out of fiat based centralized markets is a great hedge against the kind of derivative based exploitation we saw in 2008. As an Austrian school economics student there's nothing more exciting than the means to opt out of such a corrupt system.
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:03:09
That's fine. It's not stupid to wish the failure upon bad actors nor is it stupid to ridicule those who adopt the "services" of the bad actors. The time that passes for adoption is meaningless. Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme and the longer it spends on the fringes the better for the entire protocol and it's development.
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:46:55
Btcpay is stupid easy no excuse

Next cycle I think will take us to 70k before correcting to 20k...then we'll hit six digits after that cycle recovers. May take a few years but it'll be worth it
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:51:52
i can send from gdax directly to trezor???
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:24:48
I just buy $500 every two weeks off of coinbase then transfer to trezor as soon as able when the btc is available(usually takes about 6 days from order). I am concerned about strategy going forward. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:36:04

Bullshit. Not all craptos use cryptography. Also blockchain is a meme designed to draw attention from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:34:08
sleepy no offense man, but most of us gave up trying to predict shit a long time ago, we simply put in what we can afford to lose and dollar cost average regardless of price, and just go about our lives.

of course its possible. its possible that a meteor will crash through your roof and hit you square in the face too.

Lol... When new industries are created old ones go away if they can't compete. It's natural. The fact that you don't even realize this... And I'm the dumb one?

john locke had faith his ideas would be implemented someday, and for the most part they were.

Sorry your logic is inconsistent. You have faith your BTC will be worth more in the future than the past. It's not a bad word in this context. It's hope. optimism.

legally, of course. no one is breaking any laws. Many are saying if you renounce citizenship, you dont have to report that you hold btc on the way out. After that, the question is where to? What countries accept freedom in their borders?

A lot of first world people who have access to banking just don't understand the risk they take by trusting third parties with their money. They sit in comfort and solace now, but as throughout history, those that are trusted will always show their true colors when shit hits the fan. Trusting your wealth with banks is the riskiest thing a person could do in this day and age. Many examples in just the last 10 years that prove that banks cannot be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:57:20

not necessarily. schnorr signatures will fix it...whether or not we will soft fork remains to be seen.

Okay? 
@_date: 2019-09-09 06:05:58
I still don't understand...are you saying you would trade your SATs for debt based inflationary government paper?

i store the bulk of my btc on my trezor, with a little bit on bittrex if i want to do some short trading on other cryptos, but do use coinbase as a means of USD--BTC exchange. Regardless, I don't want uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:49:46
it will stabilize . probably around a $2,000,000/btc rate or so (or 4-5 years) still in the early adoption phase. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 16:37:20
"governments without revenue are powerless.".... That's kind of the point dude. Socialism has proven over and over to be a complete failure throughout history. You don't need a corrupt ruling class to have rules. I don't need or want rulers in my life. Government in all forms is cancer to human progress.
@_date: 2018-07-18 13:03:26

The lesson? Never sell. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:25:31
What about it? Metals are hard to transport, hard to verify, hard to hide, and these flaws are magnified when compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:12:58
Then those merchants shouldn't do it at all.
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:35:22
Lol what? I suppose anyone that wants to print infinite fiat is good for Bitcoin but that's a little misleading.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:17:07
i move immediately so thats fine with me then.

@_date: 2018-07-09 17:31:14
its both. do you even bitcoin bro
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:18:00
It might just be the half a bottle of wine talking, but I love stacking sats when everyone else is panicking. A toast to the sellers! May they not commit suicide.

LN is meant for small, frequent, transactions. Use on chain for expensive transactions.

Then they deserved every bit of their disappointment. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:38:53
Lol why would anyone trade money for worthless paper? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:00:52
Converting or adopting are better words for most of us. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:58:06
Uhhh no 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:51:03
seems this way. maybe more to be honest. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 05:24:16
The service is centralized but it's non custodial
@_date: 2017-10-01 12:02:39
how soon will we know when the fork is? Will we have enough time? I t takes 6 days or so to process a transaction from fiat to coin on coinbase before i can send to trezor
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:00:59
Don't use either. Use bisq or hodl hodl
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:32:27

Well...I hate to be a purist or whatever(not really), but some philosophically stringent libertarians (including myself) would say that voting(and participating in democracies, republics, etc.) is an act of violence because you are trying to get a majority together to use force of numbers to impose rules on the minority, which would violate the non aggression principle. :)

When you put your money in a bank, your money is theirs to loan out at interest and profit from. The FDIC insurance isn't for your money, it's for theirs. And when they over extend themselves, the taxpayers bail them out while others suffer. Not only is storing your wealth in a bank irresponsible, its downright immoral. Sorry to be so "extreme" but years and years of study and experience have molded me into seeing the system for what it is...exploitation. I know what you are going to ask next (everyone always does) Do I still have a checking account? Yep. I still use fiat when I need to to maintain my current lifestyle. The future isn't adopted yet, it's still in pre-development. Do I feel safer being the custodian of my own wealth outside of banks? Absolutely. So while the future may take a decade or two to arrive, that's okay. It's on its way and grows every minute. Cat's out of the bag.  The banking system is a mom and pop book store, and we are the dawn of amazon.

It would take me too long to explain all the innovations bitcoin provides. I suggest if you're new to go to lopp.net/bitcoin.html and go through some of the content there. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:20:42
Actually that's the complete opposite of what you were saying...never sell means never convert to fiat not never spend...
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:14:11
apples and oranges, but thanks for the comment.

What? Is using bitcoin as it was intended so foreign to you? It's not and has never been a get rich quick scheme or an investment and people who think it is or treats it like one really need to educate themselves. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 16:36:14
"Are you buying Bitcoin to increase you fiat worth?" No. I am converting a portion of my wealth from fiat because I don't want to have to rely on banks. Banks are incredibly inefficient and corrupt so why the hell would I trust all of my wealth with them?

@_date: 2018-04-29 04:19:29
Yes. People do know. A lot of people. Just because you don't doesn't mean no one does.    no one needs to be trusted for me to use it in commerce. It's peer to peer. Do you even...good lord. Just go study or something. The fiat conversion rate does not really matter. If you think it does then you need to study up on the tech. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:12:33

@_date: 2018-04-04 18:15:59
No way. When I got in I didn't get in based on FOMO or "get rich quick" nonsense the idiots a few months ago did. I got into it because I fell in love with the tech, and decided I will never move my holdings back to fiat. What's a bitcoin worth? A bitcoin is worth a bitcoin.

well thats fine. ive bought tons of stuff with my bitcoin over the time ive had it...including computer parts, pillows, food and drink, and clothing. so...to each their own i suppose. I don't like to HODL, i prefer to spend and replace. I don't understand what you mean by bitcoin holding anything back...lightning works and its amazing. on chain transactions are cheap thanks to segwit adoption, and the future is bright. eclair wallet hasnt even been on mainnet for more than a month and ive already used it to buy food and drink and clothes using lightning. its growing extremely fast.

Shit. You know what, you have opened my eyes. I am converting all of my bitcoin back to fiat and trusting the banking system to hold and keep it safe. I will use third parties in every way to transfer said fiat when I wish to purchase something, as they can be trusted completely(during proclaimed business hours of course), and I trust them more than myself and more than any consensus based immutable and censorship resistant  protocols(and we all know banks and organizations like paypal are completely virtuous and moral based institutions). One of us. One of us.

Well, in that case as an anarchist I only have one thing to say to help you out. That is basically anarchism means NO RULERS not NO RULES. And reading a book or two on the topic would help. Most modern libertarian (libertarian means the belief in the non aggression principle, which is only true if one is anti-state, as the state is the institutionalization of force and violence by definition and thus the opposite of libertarian) authors and speakers are very engaging. Another side tip, do not mistake libertarian party for libertarian. The libertarian party is much like Ver's bcash. They misrepresent what libertarian means in attempt to spread non truths.

bitcoin has never been about investing...from satoshi to andreas, to a lot of educated people in between. bitcoin is not an investment. that is not its purpose and never has been. this is not and has never been a get rich quick investment scheme. in this case, warren is correct. but hes wrong in that it is gambling. what is gambling is keeping your wealth in banks

"Blockchain account" ? What the fuck does that mean.  You really shouldn't be using the word 'blockchain', or 'account' to describe these sorts of things. Blockchain is a meme and means nothing in the context of your app, and the word account is an archaic word from the banking system that bitcoin is trying to disrupt. The word account implies you must get permission to use in some way.  Use proper terminology: Wallet, keys, address,  etc.

Don't get me wrong. Even though this is what you did, the smart thing to do is to store your private keys in a hardware wallet and either DCA, or just put your hardware wallet in your sock drawer and forget about it for a few years(dont forget your pin or lose your seed words).

@_date: 2019-05-27 05:49:57
badass thanks. It was my understanding that sha 256 was used for the hashing of the already existing private key in order to generate addresses etc. It is also used in the genesis of the master private key as well?

Yeah, I read that several times. I forgot he said $100k in 2019 though.

I honestly wish this would have happened next year and we had 2k-3k this year for accumulation. OHhhhhhhhhh well.

I know... I have been lazy about building a dedicated linux machine though. I will get around to it...eventually. The rasp pi thing was for educational purposes.

When will I know I am ready for the full linux machine? Feels too soon still. :P

@_date: 2019-05-31 19:54:04
Why? Seriously? Any attack or proposed attack on the bitcoin system should be met with vitriol. The fuck you expect? 2x was not a way to "fix scaling" it was an attempt at control of the system. Scaling was never the real debate, only control.

Currencies are issued by governments. Bitcoin is not a currency. It's just the money of the internet. It doesn't even actually exist. Only the ledger exists, which keeps track of which addresses have which amount of bitcoin. It's unclassifiable is what I'm saying.

I mean just install bitcoind and LND on your own machine. It could be rasp pi, thats fine. What I am saying is don't rely on others for updates/infrastructure. Rely on yourself...I built my node back in January without any linux background. I had to educate myself but it has been very very rewarding.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:33:43

People who improperly secure their private keys are vulnerable. We have already established this. When has someone hacked the actual distributed ledger to extract private keys from the sha 256 double hashed tx?

What percent of the population used a credit card regularly 10 years after they were released? What percent of merchants accepted it as payment? We are talking around 1965. Do you think those with a brand new amex in 1965 didn't carry cash with them? What percent of people write checks at the grocery store in 1960? What percent write checks at the grocery store today? Basically, what's your point? Because you're not really presenting anything except historically ignorant assumptions and frankly, nonsense. Bitcoin is to plastic, as plastic was to paper. We're just in 1960 levels. A good friend of mine accepts bitcoin both on chain and on LN at his food truck he runs down here near fort Lauderdale. Guess what? he accepts cash and card too. 20% off order for bitcoin orders though. Does he expect more that 1% to pay with Satoshis? Of course not. But it's a fun hobby for him and he's actually doing something useful in helping the network grow and educating himself. Have some patience, sit the hell down, and wait. Or better yet, do something useful.
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:58:26
Yes people who improperly store their private keys are vulnerable. That's not a hack. Its just people improperly securing their keys. When has the ledger been hacked? 
@_date: 2018-12-03 07:28:49
The last point by wallets created do you mean public keys on the network or more wallet apps that hold your keys?
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:34:31

Bull shit. He never apologized for attempting to hijack the system with his 2x troupe, and he rolled over to the regulators with KYC AML. He is an anti-bitcoin villain and is possibly worse than Ver. Voorhees has never apologized.  Granted, the way you talk makes me think you were a 2xer as well, and if that is the case then go fuck yourself.

Not sure what you mean by wallet. Private keys are what matters. So, please hack my private keys. Please. Or find me one instance of someone brute forcing their way through sha 256, elliptical curve double hash cryptography to extract private keys from the bitcoin distributed ledger. That would be a hack. It has never happened. Wallets are third party applications not the bitcoin network. The security of private keys are dependant on the user, not the system. That's the price of freedom at this time. The fact that you don't realize this even further cements the magnitude of your ignorance of the topic. You truly have no idea who you're talking to. You're spreading lies and scumbags like you will always be on the losing end of history.

eventually the HODLers/accumulators will accumulate so much there will be nothing left to trade. At that point the only way to get bitcoin will be to earn it. The way halvings are set up pretty much guarantee this. Exchanges will not last forever.

@_date: 2018-12-02 14:21:21
No one ever said exchanges were a safe place to give custody of private keys to. In fact, the opposite is advised ad nausium. This has literally nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with careless people.

if you think of bitcoin as an "investment" Then you have already failed. Trading government fiat for  bitcoin is a bet against banks. A bet against wars. A bet against tyranny. If you consider it an investment, you will be stressed out. If you plan to convert bitcoin back to fiat at some point do us all and yourself a favor and go buy some stocks.

Monero is an altcoin. The anonymity set of Monero is 2–10. Wasabi’s is constant 100. However, in Monero, every transaction is a mixing transaction. With Wasabi you just have to do it at the beginning.The wallet implements a trustless Bitcoin mixing technique, called Chaumian CoinJoin and enforces constant 100 anonymity set. This means waiting for peers may take a long time until liquidity catches up, no anonymity system used today in any cryptocurrency comes close to this number.

You see, bitcoin is deflationary and the policy is transparent. Due to this we can predict the exact supply very closely. When you factor in supply and demand economics, on top of bitcoin's value proposition and technology, it isn't hard to conclude that it is a much better system than government centralized inflationary garbage paper money. Welcome to the show!

I'm trying to cull the spread of inaccurate nomenclature. Bitcoins are not stored on computers. Keys to access addresses on the ledger are. This is important distinction that needs to be addressed with newbies and it seems, some vets.

It blows my mind that this isn't the way it's always been. I mean, If I go make 1 million tokens, and sell my mom one for $100, does that mean I have a $100 million market cap? Without liquidity there's no point. Yet this is how "dominance" has been calculated. It's crazy.

One of the links you posted about hacks literally only talked about the 51% attack 
possibility  which is not a hack. That's why I asked if you knew what the definition of hack is. I still believe you have no idea what it means, even after posting the definition you're still ignorant and you recompound that ignorance.

Lightning Network exchanges are coming. Soon near 100% of all bitcoin use will be on LN. $2 still gets you about 25000 satoshis. Can save and buy when mempool is low pay a few pennies for the fee if you want to. If not, wait until LN is fully developed.

I suppose the word "gains" is subjective. I don't really consider inflationary government paper as a gain.

Do you know the 4 steps of the evolution of new money? 1. Collectable. 2. Store of value (we are in the beginning of this phase) 3. Means of exchange (This is the step you are so fixated on. ITS NOT READY YET). 4. Unit of account (Things are measured in value relative to btc)  ... You are not thinking big picture. And that's okay. Most people find it impossible to zoom out of their tunnel vision and see the big picture implications. Either that or you may just need to study more. And to your "idealists hold forever hoping to become rich" is complete bullshit. The great majority of holders will never convert back to garbage inflationary government paper because they understand what true value is (secure, immutable, fungible, private, borderless, permissionless, unconfiscatable, censorship resistance, etc. etc.) . It would be completely idiotic to trade satoshis back for government fiat once you understand this. You are clearly new, so please do yourself a favor and study more. Take care.
