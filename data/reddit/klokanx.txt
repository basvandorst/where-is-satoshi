You can generate random seed and private key using dice. But I would like to see how you generate your BTC address to send BTC to. And there is another level: sending it out when you need it...

Nope. It does not. There is a python script that can be used offline, or you can use the myTrezor web page offline. Also, wallets that plan to support Trezor can implement simple offline initialization.

The attack described in the article is dangerous for the host machine. Host machine can be compromised with malicious USB device. Trezor cannot be (unless there is some disastrous firmware bug) compromised by the malicious host computer so you should not be afraid of your Trezor coins.
You still should be concerned about your computer and you should not plug in unknown USB devices into it.

TBH I don't understand this multisig hype. If you can't secure your first computer, you throw second (vulnerable) computer into the game. How is that supposed to help? It just adds obscurity, because the attacker must link those two computers together. And that's easy because most multisig solutions reuse addresses.
I believe single HD Trezor gives you much higher security than 5 computer multisig.
@_date: 2014-09-02 12:13:56
You did not mention anything about icon. So I asked you how it's gonna work. Thanks for clarifying that about the network stack.
I did ask that specific question becuase there are wallets out there (I'm not going to name them here) which claim to be "Android cold storage" becuase you disable your wifi in settings. As if it could not be flipped. FYI: It can be enabled even if you remove network stack from source. The solution with wifi chip is always less "cold" than a solution without it. That's why I was asking you, how Android solution is better.
And your other argument that it's easier to examine Android code than to examine Trezor code is wrong as well. Android had 56000 source files back in 2010. Trezor firmware is 26000 LINES of code. There is no question which one is easier to go through.
Edit: BTW I love my Android mobile and I think Android is the best OS for mobile devices. I just think it's a poor choice of OS for a secure cold wallet.

1. Wipe your Trezor.
2. Initialize it again and create encrypted seed.
3. Write down first receiving address of your encrypted wallet.
4. Wipe the device and recover it with original non-encrypted seed.
5. Send everything to your encrypted address.
6. Wipe the device and recover it with encrypted seed.
7. Profit.

BIP38 is an excellent secure way to store your private key, BUT there are three issues with it:
- You need to encrypt it on a computer.
- You need to decrypt it on a computer.
- You need to use your unsecured private key on a computer to sign a transaction.
The main security concern with bitcoin is the wallet security. You either trust third party (in your case blockchain.info) or you trust your computer. Some people have very bad experience with trusting third parties. And securing your computer is difficult. As I explained above, BIP38 does not solve the wallet security problem, because it does not remove your computer from the equation.
If you are able to keep your computer secure, then you don't need Trezor. If you can't keep it secure, then BIP38 won't help you, but Trezor will. It is the secure computer to generate, store and use your private keys.

If manufacturer takes intentional action to steal from you, he should go to jail. If somebody puts wifi chip in the device to steal your money, you can find that chip and sue him. I'm not afraid to use my Trezor. Are you not afraid to use your computer/mobile? Those can have backdoors too.
Edit: I would be afraid to use casascius because you don't generate your key yourself. The three products you mentioned are quite different and there is not a single answer for your question.

There is no RSA used in Bitcoin, nor in Trezor. And you cannot prove it is backdoored either. If you can, then write a paper about it and be the most famous computer scientist EVER.

Just some comments on your setup:
1. Your "offline" phone has the capability to become online. It was online before, so it can be hacked already and it can be online again in the future. It might be online now without you knowing it.
2. You cannot guarantee that the complex device as a phone with so many interfaces and various hardware pieces is not hackable even if in airplane mode.
3. The same as 2) holds for the complex operation system like android. It it very secure, but complex and you never know.
4. QR codes are not perfect for addresses and signatures transmission. The problem is that the same data can be encoded in many ways. You never know, even if the data you scan are correct, that some additional data (private keys) did not leak via some info hidden info the QR code.
5. You have no secure way to update Bither to new version on your offline phone.
6. I don't know how recovery works with Bither. What happens if your offline phone breaks? This might be not an issue thou.
7. Trezor uses BIP32 deterministic wallets. You never reuse the same address twice. When you spend BTC from address (and reveal your public key) all your BTC are transferred to another deterministic wallet (where the public key is hidden). Signing multiple transactions with the same key is a security risk (playstation 3 fail)
8. Trezor is more user friendly. You don't need two devices. You don't need to scan anything. You don't need to charge anything. And working with it is really easy.
9. When Trezor is stolen, the flash memory on the chip cannot be read easily (unlike the phone memory).
There is probably more...

People like to steal Bitcoins and hack anything because it's kind of anonymous. There is much more money than 1.5 million dollars out there in banks but people don't rob banks that often because they would go to jail.
What I'm trying to say is that interfering with someones delivery chain, manufacturing fake devices and bribing someone requires you to come out of anonymity of internet and risking going to jail. If you are willing to risk that and be a real life villain, there are easier money elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:58:44
This solution does solve the storage, but not the key generation and transaction signing. Key generation and transaction signing is still done on (potentially unsecure) computer, i.e., you are still at risk any time you want to use your money.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:07:15
What I really don't like about online solutions is that they make it hard for you to withdraw money. You have these 2FAs, emails sent to zillions addresses, delays in transactions etc which make it hard for you to use your money (and to thief to steal them). 
But that's only half of the picture!!!
The real question is how they protect bitcoins from hackers that don't hack your account, but from hackers who hack their servers. How do they protect your coins from bugs in their software? blockchain.info coins were recently stolen (and luckily returned) via their software bug (they never heard of RFC6979?!). Gox and others were hacked. If this can happen to the most reputable companies in Bitcoin business I would be worried that it can happen again...

There is a fine line between monitoring everything and stealing.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:09:32
I totally agree with the original post. Hardware wallets need competition. But I have to say that your idea of what the hardware wallet should be is just plain wrong. You can have your "Android wallet" with zillions of interfaces (all with potential attack vectors) today, but that's not what the wallet should be. The (digital) wallet should (digitally) safeguard your funds and for that purpose is should be a single purpose device with a single interface you are going to use.
Edit: And by the way, I would not mind Trezor like device physically mounted inside the Android phone as a separate chip. It could be always accessible to the Android apps to add NFC, QR and all the other interfaces you want, but in the end being separated from the outside world by a single interface with its single purpose. But that wouldn't be a hardware wallet with NFC and QR, but an Android phone with NFC, QR and a hardware wallet.
Edit2: So to summarize, Trezor is the single REAL hardware wallet. Devices based on Android like Hardbit or BFL's Bitsafe are not real hardware wallets.

Please explain to me two things:

- Why would you think Electrum has a higher security. I'm not saying it has lower or higher. I'm just curious why it is higher.

Yes it is possible to manufacture that. But there are no POS terminals accepting that so it's useless.

You are wrong. The people here don't really need this that much, because they already know how to securely spend their coins. The people out there need this, otherwise they will be robbed and BTC would never reach wider adoption because of computer wallets security. In fact, when you open any single article that talks about BTC adoption rate, the main concern is the end user wallet security. Hardware wallets remove the biggest barrier that prevents wide bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2014-08-05 08:14:01
First of all: Nobody ever paid 1000+ USD for this, because BTC was much cheaper when Trezor was in pre-order. People bought pizza for a lot of coins in early days, but that does not make pizza expensive today.
Second: If you hold more than 200USD worth of Bitcoin, then the Trezor may be the difference between keeping them and loosing them to a hacker. From this perspective it might be interesting for those people to have one. Not everybody can keep his computer secure, and it costs money as well.
Third: You can't spend money from paper wallet easily. It is very good storage, until you want to spend your BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:09:52
In basic setup, Trezor can generate 2billion accounts for each cryptocurrency you store on it (you can store more at once). Each account generates it's own chain of normal and change addresses with BIP32.
In more advanced setup, you can have multiple passphrases each giving you completely separate account address space with plausible deniability.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:38:28

Firmware does not wipe the device if everything went smoothly. Only in case unsigned firmware is flashed OR there is electricity outage or some other critical error, the trezor is wiped. You should always have your seed backup when updating firmware, BUT you should almost never need it.
@_date: 2014-06-22 15:33:17
TPM hardware can do RSA but Bitcoin uses ECDSA. So the processor has to do signing and thus data have to be in memory. Any PCI express device can read memory so signing on your PC with NVidia graphics card with NSA backdoor&amp;drivers is inherently insecure. TPM won't help it.

The unfixable part of the USB problem is dangerous to the computer. Any USB device (including Trezor with a custom firmware) can execute commands on the computer.
The fixable part about the USB problem affects USB devices: Their firmwares (including Trezors) can be flashed and many devices (excluding Trezor) are happy to run any firmware without complaining.
Trezor is not affected, because Trezor would complain about flashing unsigned firmware onto it. It would also wipe itself if you confirm you want to install unsigned firmware, thus nobody can steal your Trezor private keys even with the device and a custom firmware.
Bottom line, no issues here as stated in the article.

No you cannot. You would have to create a fake transaction that would hash to the hash existing in the blockchain with different outputs and that's hard.


Yes, Trezor does not support payment protocol (yet) but it asks you to confirm every output address. It's the question of convenience and not security.


I'm not aware of it. But can't it be done?
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:42:24
I have seen the video. But I doubt that what I saw was the working device. I believe they made it up to show, how it is supposed to work.
Trezor had such fancy video with the device supposedly working in May 2013:  and it took them another year.
Also, what I said is that it is very hard if not impossible to have such a device powered with the SoC they claim they will use. That sparked my curiosity...
So you have no argument to support your claim that this one will be inexpensive?
Edit: I have read something about it and it seems they are really signing BTC transactions on 8kB chip. I find it quit an interesting technological achievement :) Looking forward to hearing whether it will be really inexpensive and if they will make it opensource.
@_date: 2014-12-23 13:18:40
Because Trezor itself is a cold PC, just much better from the security perspective, because it runs way less software.
The way how you move data to and from cold wallet is automatized and controlled unlike the transfer via unsecure USBs that is both error prone and may be compromised in case you use malicious USB stick.
And it's much more user friendly.
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:40:55
Sure there will be people trying to break into Trezor. That is the time when the number of interfaces comes into play. Having a single interface means the attacker has very few attack vectors. Having a small codebase, single security expert can asses Trezor security. The closed-source iOS can never be verified it is secure. Single person can never go through all the code.
Indeed Trezor uses USB to connect to computer, all the messages are well defined and verified when they arrive the device. The number of message types your iPhone wifi can get from anybody around you is uncountable.

Unfortunately no program can check hardware and I don't think that checking software the way you would like it to be checked is possible. Let's not demand impossible features.

It does improve one thing: You gain the control over the data exchange. If your device shows the QR code, you have a choice to scan it or not scan it. You still don't understand what is being transmitted, because you can't read QR codes...
Despite all this, I don't consider this an improvement in security because there is no way to rule out that additional information is being transmitted over side channels.
Moreover it's terrible from the UX perspective to force user to scan codes... I love my Trezor that allows me to do secure transactions with two clicks.
@_date: 2014-09-02 12:47:19
If malware can hijack your phone kernel, it can also install some simple wifi driver.
Trezor firmware is upgradable. You need to boot the device with both buttons pressed to start it in firmware update mode. Firmware is digitally signed by the vendor and you see the fingerprint of the firmware on the display and confirm that you want to flush it with the button on the device.
You are right that the device could be cheaper, but I was under the impression that we are talking about security, not the price.
I know some people who went through all Trezor sources, but there is nobody who went through all the Android sources. Many people will look at it and try to break it, because money is at stake. We will see in the future if it can be exploited. I'm not saying it cannot be. I'm just saying that Android based wallet is much more likely to be hacked, because of the complexity of interactions of individual software components.
@_date: 2014-10-18 07:41:07
Dude, stop lying here. This works just fine. We are talking about Trezor recovery here, not BIP32 address generation.
Trezor recovery is governed by BIP39 which clearly states and I quote: A user may decide to protect their mnemonic with a passphrase. If a passphrase is not present, an empty string "" is used instead.
Thus using Trezor with empty passphrase and with passphrase-less setup yields the same wallet.
We all understand, that empty passphrase "" yields different wallet than passphrase "a", but that is not what is being asked. The question is whether the same mnemonic with empty passphrase yields the same wallet than this mnemonic in the passphrase-less setup and that is clearly true according to BIP39 spec.

If you use your iOS, Android or PC correctly i.e., don't jailbreak it, don't open every binary you receive in e-mail and don't install all cracked games from god knows where, then all platforms are reasonably secure. However, not ultimately secure. There is known malware for iOS, so you cannot say it is malware free.
The very unfortunate fact is that many users cannot keep their devices safe.
These guys know what they talk about when they say that the biggest problem of bitcoin is the end user wallet security: 
And I bet they know that there is iOS out there. To quote from the video: you would be surprised by the "number and kinds of attacks" once you start to deal with stealable money on your device.
Trezor does these things your iPhone can never do:
- have a single interface with a single purpose (no wifi, no BT, no internet connection...)
- runs only the signed software and does not allow the user to run anything else on it
Thus the security of Trezor because of these properties is strictly better than the one of iPhone. The question is, whether you need it that high. Is the iPhone security good enough for you? That depends on the amount you want to store, your practices and digital security awareness.
@_date: 2014-10-18 18:37:08
I blame your misunderstanding on the fact you don't know how Trezor works. So let me explain it to you: During initial setup and recovery you have the choice to enable or disable passphrase protection. You CANNOT CHANGE your choice later, unless you wipe. So basically when OP did not enable this option during the initial device setup she was stuck with passphrase-less setup.
The only way to get the passphrase protection is to WIPE TREZOR AND SET IT UP AGAIN, THIS TIME ENABLING THE PASSPHRASE OPTION. OP asked whether after doing this she would have access to her BTC and she does... Please reread what OP asks, thanks.
So the missunderstunding is right here:


This is not what was meant. Enable passphrase means setup Trezor to request it. Not enter some non-empty string as a passphrase.

Fake ATM has to look like a boclx with card reader and a screen showing random ad. Fake Trezor has to look like Trezor, it has to act like one for a prolonged period of time to make user confident storing coins on it.
To plant fake ATM you don't need to do anything special, just drop it at the street. To deliver fake Trezors you need yo either intercept their delivery man or convince a reseller to sell those (which is hard to do anonymously).

It's like saying that Ferrari is a waste of money, because you can get from point A to point B with a shitty car. In some sense, you are right. You will get from point A to point B.

Extracting keys from btchip is probably harder than extracting them from trezor(still very hard). The problem is that without display, it's much easier to trick user into signing something he don't want to sign. That's the real problem, not the extraction.
Also I don't think that btchip is a HD wallet. Can you support your claim that it has a HD capability with a reference?

I would understand somebody who would dice his seed and then import it into Trezor. That person does not trust two sources of entropy, or is just the control freak who want to know that she herself generated the seed.
What I don't understand is doing this on the second computer. Now this other computer AND trezor know the seed and eventhough the computer is presumably offline, that's no better security than letting true offline Trezor generate the seed.

Yeah, the word with uppercase characters should be either rejected or mapped to the same lowercase word. Case should not make a difference for this purpose and it kind of makes sense, because these words should be easy and error proof to memorize and memorizing a word is somewhat easier than memorizing the case of it's letters.

I see your point and I guess you are right that the chances are in your favor. The problem is that this is still a software solution and is as safe as any other software solution.
I believe that this is conceptually very different from a dedicated hardware.
BTW: The wired article that you posted says you can download application data like this. If you install Bither and go online once, you are as vulnerable as hacked celebrities, because your wallet is in the cloud. Maybe it is online right after you install it, before you can go offline.

It's difficult to backdoor simple open source software/hardware.
Since it's open source, everybody can see the backdoor.
Since it's simple, it's easy to find it.
Governments may have backdoors in common operating systems or big companies infrastructure, because we cannot check their software/hardware and even if we could, it's hundreds of millions of lines of code.
But Trezor, for instance, has 20k lines of code and a single page hardware blueprint. You cannot put a backdoor in it without somebody noticing.
Some other wallets you mentioned are open source as well and if I was afraid about government stealing money (which they do:  ) I would use those wallets that are most open.

If Trezor becomes commonplace, two things will happen:
- More people will look at it's sources so it would match Android from this perspective
- It would become much cheaper. Cheaper than any Android device can be. It's expensive to produce small batches of new hardware and pay for R&amp;D at the same time. But when R&amp;D is payed for and batches are larger, it will be cheap.
If that happens, it will be better, smaller and more secure than Android. Good for masses :)

If the "same thing" we are accomplishing is "being a BTC wallet" then indeed ALL wallets are doing the same thing. But, you should not neglect the security element and say it's the same. Because there is a difference between being robbed and not being robbed.
Trezor does not have QR scanner because having one is a security risk. How can you do a secure transaction from a QR code if you cannot verify that this is indeed the address you want to send your money to? Can you read QR codes? For an unsecure transaction you can use your computer/phone.
On the other hand, Trezor is just a signing device that has to be connected to some wallet. myTrezor is the default choice, but Electrum and others are adding support. Displaying and reading QR codes is the software wallet business, not the signing device business. In fact, myTrezor can display and scan QR codes.
Paper is excellent storage, but is quite useless at signing transactions. And it's not something what a regular guy from the street can use. If you know how to use Armory on a air gapped system and you are happy with your setup then I'm happy it works for you and you have perfectly safe system (eventhough a bit clunky to use). But I think it's not for everybody.

OP had Bitcoins on Trezor that was not protected by passphrase and wanted to have them protected with passphrase. This is what OP should have done to achieve this in the most convenient way:
1. Wipe Trezor.
2. Set it up again with the same recovery words (as used in the initial set up the first time), this time enabling the use passphrase option.
3. Plug Trezor in and enter desired passphrase. Write down the first receive address.
4. Replug Trezor, this time entering empty passphrase. OP now has access to BTC that were on the original passphrase unprotected wallet thanks to BIP39 spec that I linked in this thread.
5. Send all BTC to address from step 3.
6. Replug Trezor, enter passphrase from step 3. All BTC are now on this passphrase protected wallet.
Now please re-read OP and please note that what OP is asking in second question is exactly what OP should have done in steps 1. and 2. Please note also that after doing this OP has full access to BTC as OP is able to send them to passphrase protected wallet in step 5. The second option works.

Trezor preorders started when 1BTC was 120USD. Keep in mind that this was an "enthusiast price" for guys who wanted to support the development. The final price should be lower. It will be available for retail in a month and the price will be announced then.
Back to your question: There is no other true hardware wallet out there. There are Android applications that act as a hardware wallet if you have offline phone. Keep in mind that such a solutions have inherent Android security issues and are, imho, not suitable for big BTC amount cold storage.

trezor has "web of trust features built in". all you need now is applications that use this. and of course we need couple of weeks until the device becomes generally available.
@_date: 2014-12-07 13:37:33
1. They build public github sources of the firmware with deterministic build tools.
2. Five employees verify that the sources build to the same binary on their machines and sign the build with their keys.
3. Signatures are attached to the firmware binary and it's published on their website.
4. Everybody can check the firmware is indeed built from the public open sources.
5. When flashing the firmware on the device, it would check firmware signatures and if it won't find at least three out of five valid it will prompt you whether you really want to use unsigned firmware.
6. You can flash unsigned firmware by confirming, but the internal state of the Trezor would be lost and you would need to either re-initialize the device or recover it. The unsigned firmware warning will appear every time you plug the device in.
Because of above, it's 100% secure to flash firmware on compromised computer.

I re-read your post and I'm not sure if you know Trezor well, because all the Electrum features you mentioned are in fact in Trezor as well, so there is no need for re-implementing.
Trezor automatically finds your addresses based on the seed. It can be recovered from mnemonic and you can even have a watch-only trezor system. And Trezor is not proprietary, but open sw and hw.
@_date: 2014-08-26 19:20:46
Trezor remembers only one seed. It will always be like that. That is not a limit though, because with a single seed you can have virtually unlimited number of accounts in BIP44 or other use case purposes of BIP43. You can use same seed for signing BTC, LTC, Doge, messages, logging into e-mail, facebook, sending encrypted messages to a friend etc. Not everything is already implemented though.
Trezor will not import private keys from other sources, because it cannot guarantee security of such a key anyway. It lived outside of Trezor, thus there is no way how you can guarantee it never leaves Trezor. The only supported workflow is generate your seed in Trezor.
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:58:21
Exactly. You exchange digital security for the physical security that is much easier to grasp. You can always protect your seed with a passphrase so your words may not automaticaly give access to your coins!
BTW: Storing words on any digital medium (including encrypted USB) somehow defeats the purpose of Trezor. Words should never touch any digital device and should stay on paper(s).

I'm going to comment on a possible improvements list you provided: "hardware duplication, smaller size, cheaper and less powerful hardware, better code, more wallet types"
Hardware duplication goes against the hardware size and price and icreases complexity, thus decreases security. I would not consider it an improvement. Better code would be good to have provided there is something wrong with the existing code. What is wrong about it and how can you make it better?
I would support the rest of the improvements. If you can come up with a smaller, cheaper device, that would clearly allow more people to buy it. That would be awesome. Also there may be some improvements somebody else can propose here or elsewhere worth implementing...

This is interesting. They claim they will use ST23YT66 to power this device. This one has 8kb RAM and no hardware capability to sign BTC transaction. I would like to see how they are going to implement the signer in 8kb.
Anyway, Trezor hardware itself is quite cheep, but development is expensive. If there is huge market for these the price will go down.
What makes you think that this device will be inexpensive? I.e. how can they make their development cheap?
And what does "coming soon" mean? 2 years or so?
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:18:41
I don't advise to generate a seed externally and import it, because that degrades your security (if you are unable to secure your computer, what is the main reason you use trezor). See this post:

1. BoP: 
2. AFAIK BoP stores your public keys as long as your browser session is connected to the myTrezor.com. It does not request your keys. You request your account balances and for that purpose you provide your account public keys. BoP has the copy of blockchain and it can generate all your HD addresses. It knows all your transactions and can tell you about them.
3. Web wallet mytrezor.com is a static web page hosted at satoshilabs. Your session data is stored on local PC, however it connects to BoP that is hosted at satoshilabs.
You either have to have a blockchain copy or ask somebody about your balances. If you are using web wallet, you are doing the latter.

You should plan your security as if you could be a next target of a targeted attack. Less likely targets for theft will be robbed right after more likely targets.

@_date: 2014-08-17 22:53:07
Imagine you are a pirate. You are going to do a new kind of malware. Which platform are you going to target? Windows phone maybe? No! It probably is not going to be windows phone. Does it make windows phone malware free? Yes. There is almost no malware targeting windows phone. Does it make Windows phone secure? I doubt so.
Up to couple of weeks ago, Apple did not allow BTC wallets in their store. There were no money to be stolen on iOS. iOS platform was not the platform targeted by hackers. When they allow wallets on iOS, only then we will see the kinds of attacks on this "secure platform". Trezor also started retailing very recently. Many people will attack it as well. We shall see which platform can better protect your coins. I hope that the Trezor will be what I expect it to be.
@_date: 2014-08-15 06:26:15
People who can make big decisions know about iOS 8.0 with fingerprint and shit coming out, but they still consider the biggest problem of the BTC adoption to be the wallet security: 
And it really is according to the research: 
And I really like android, it's as close to perfection as it could be. But there are limits to how secure an OS with such huge codebase could be. That is the reason why the REAL wallet should not be Android based and it should not have three, nor two, but just one interface. That's why Trezor is the only hardware wallet mentioned in this Dell paper: 
eventhough there are other devices claiming to be one (see my previous post for their names).

A user may decide to protect their mnemonic by passphrase. If a passphrase is not present, an empty string "" is used instead.
To create a binary seed from the mnemonic, we use PBKDF2 function with a mnemonic sentence (in UTF-8 NFKD) used as a password and string "mnemonic" + passphrase (again in UTF-8 NFKD) used as a salt. Iteration count is set to 2048 and HMAC-SHA512 is used as a pseudo-random function. Desired length of the derived key is 512 bits (= 64 bytes).
This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-0032 or similar methods.

You wouldn't feel comfortable with a million dollars worth of BTC on anything else than paper.

Trezor aims to be that device. iOS can never be it, because of millions of lines of code it is running.
@_date: 2014-11-04 20:42:19
12 words is secure, provided you don't recover your Trezor. If you recover once, you are still secure, because there are some fake words inserted during recovery. HOWEVER, if you recover your 12 word Trezor second time inserted fake words can be identified, because there is an intersection between first and second recovery words. Your seed can be recovered from 12 words in seconds.
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:49:21
I would agree that BCI showed amateurism on so many levels:
1. They should have had RFC6979 long time ago.
2. Their RNG should be much better.
3. No single person should have been allowed to do such change.
4. Some automatic tests should have catched this.
But you don't really know what the processes of other companies are. I have argued here:  that Trezor guys do it better (remember BCI coins were returned from Trezor) but I don't know how others do it.
Edit: I would also argue that securing hardware wallet is MUCH easier than securing a web wallet. That is why HW wallets came to existence. First of all, you have control of all software running on the device. With web wallet, your security depends on Linux servers (remember hearbleed and shellshock?), on your webserver security, on your entire toolchain and your servers are a central point of failure. With hardware wallets you have more control and devices are distributed.

Note that the cold storage proposed by others is potentialy much worse with privacy then Trezor (depending on how you use it). With Trezor, people know your balance if you share account public key with them or if it leaks. With a single cold storage address people know your balance by default. So, unless you generate new cold storage private key for every new transaction, cold storage is a terrible way to store BTC from the privacy perspective.
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:23:49

There are two possible attack vectors relevant to what you are saying:
- Replacement of Trezor software.
- Replacement of Trezor software &amp; hardware. 
The comment you cited partially explains how trezor protects you against these attacks. First of all, it extremely hard to replace Trezor software only. Everybody can build Trezor firmware from open source code, anybody can check firmware for backdoors and anybody can check firmware fingerprint. Also, it's not possible to load unsigned firmware into the device.
Against the replacement of the entire hardware, Trezor protects you with it's simplicity. It's easy to hide a malicious piece of code in computer or router that runs millions of lines of code and has several chips with you never know what they do and what code they should be running. It's difficult to do the same with Trezor unnoticed. And the reason is that Trezor has single MCU chip that runs 20k lines of signed code. It's extremely hard to hide malicious code on such chip. I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it's hard and I would say that it would be found.
And last, but not least, you should question the motivation of somebody installing malware on such device. Government agencies can monitor bitcoin transactions in blockchain. They don't need to have malicious code on Trezors. The only reason somebody would do it is if he wanted to steal from you. I assume the government does not steal from you (and again, I hope my assumption is correct). The government should be on your side and if somebody (manufacturer or company producing fake devices) steals from you there are government institutions that should work hard to catch the thief.
@_date: 2014-08-01 23:17:08
it is open software, open hardware, it has deterministic builds so you can check that you are running the correct firmware and third YES: you can install your own software on it.
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:00:12
Of course there migh be a bug in the trezor software that can be exploited through clever software based attack.
There are couple of reasons why it is less likely there is such a bug compared to other systems:
- The device is very simple. It has small interface over USB, no operating system, no other hardware/software interfaces and no other purpose.
- All the software and hardware is open source
- The code is quite small and a single person can go through it.
So to answer your question: There is no guarantee and this device is not 100% safe from software based attack, it is just very unlikely compared to other solutions.

4. Web wallet sends BoP your new transactions that BoP broadcasts to the BTC network.

It does not accomplish the same thing. Trezor does what it does in isolation, without OS, and without other software running on the device. It has a single interface with a very limited set of messages transferred over it with every one of them validated. Your computer/phone has multi-million line of code OS running on multi-million lines of code BIOS with couple of interfaces with multi-million lines of code firmware. You never know if any of the above code was not replaced with something else, because it is probably not digitally signed. Trezor firmware is signed. It's just not the same.

Electrum 2.0 seed should be compatible, but bear in mind that you don't have a cold storage gurantees of Trezor if you generate your seed on computer.

And where they are kept? QR code goes to camera. The image goes into memory where it is decoded and private keys are again stored in memory. Then they are used for signing (in memory) and then they are erased.
There are several places where this process can go wrong:
- Malware hijacks the camera of the device.
- The image is broadcasted to multiple apps.
- App is killed while signing and the private keys are read out of the core file.
- Mycelium app is hijacked and replaced by another app that user uses to scan the keys.

- There is work in progress on many non-web solutions. I believe the Electrum already supports Trezor and there are more to come.
- The Trezor recovery is deterministic in a sense that recovering two devices with the same words would lead for devices to generate the same adresses, thus having access to the same accounts/funds.
- However, the recovery process itself is not deterministic, because you enter your words in random order (randomness provided by the Trezor hrng). After recovering your account, you gave your computer information about your words, but not their order. With 24 words it's still 24! combination. Also, if you would not require to have two trezors with the same seed, then you would almost never need to recover your Trezor.
- Recovery decreases the number of combinations from 2^256 to 2^71 for 24 words. It' still virtually unattackable by current hardware but it is also significantly reduced. I would not recommend recovering Trezor just to have two exact copies of seed in two devices. I would recommend exactly the opposite: Keep just one unrecovered Trezor with your seed and multiple copies of the seed itself on paper and resend your funds to a new Trezor after you need to do recovery.
- If you really want to have two trezors with the same seed, then make sure to recover the other one on a secure computer to retain your 2^256 combinations security...

Maybe you cannot tell the difference, but the Trezor device is so simple  that it's easy to tell whether it's subbed or not. Doing that is illegal in many countries, so please sue whomever sold you fake device. You'll do good for the community. Thanks.
But I assume, you didn't even write this post. It was your subbed computer that did it on your behalf!
Edit: There is a lot of ongoing scam all around Bitcoin. Companies like MtGox hold your bitcoins online and when they have enough of them they get hacked and your savings are gone. The only solution I see is having control of your money yourself. Paper wallets are good for storage, but when you spend your BTC, you are vulnerable. And they are not simple to use. Trezor is another solution which gives you control. I trust it much more than any online service. If it does what it is supposed to do, then you are safe. If it does not (i.e., it is backdoored, malicious or subbed) then you can sue the person who did it. It's not some mystical hacker anymore. If device is backdoored then you can point at company and individuals who robbed you. Those guys have a reputation which would be ruined and I believe they don't want to go to jail. The bottom line is: I trust the device.

What do you mean by "unsecure"? Seed without passphrase is useless the same way passphrase is useless without the seed. You need to have both to create the wallet.
The main difference is the amount of entropy. Passphrase is something user has to remember end enter, i.e. it's usualy much less bits of entropy than the seed (256 bits).
Using Trezor without passphrase (this is equivalent to empty passphrase) is perfectly secure as long as nobody gets hold of the seed since the seed cannot be guessed with all that entropy. This is also the default option and passphrase is recommended only for advanced users who can remember their passphrase.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:43:42
Trezor *does not* have to trust payment request and blockchain data. If provided with fake inputs it will provide useless outputs. This is a non-issue. Trezor is more secure than breadwallet, for several reasons:
- deterministic builds mean that you know what you run.
- 3 out of 5 firmware signing scheme means that no one person can publish malicious firmware.
- The signing runs on single purpose chip that does nothing else. Phone apps can crash/be stopped while signing and private keys can be read out of the core file. This cannot happen with trezor.

RSA is not used in Bitcoin nor Trezor. It's the RSA company that provided private keys to NSA that is discredited. Not the RSA algorithm itself. You should distinguis that. Trezors are not manufactured by RSA company nor they use any of its services. They don't use RSA algorithm at all. Keep up.
Also, the article that you posted is about one government agency using one company that is now discredited. It's business is ruined.

So you are going to port existing Python code to C? Are you aware that this is not that straightforward as it seems? Also, programming MCU's goes beyond porting the code. The whole interface has to be re-worked from scratch and communicating with interfaces is a pain in a device without OS. It still might be usefull if you come up with some improvements though, but make sure it is worth it. Trezor has some of the latest BIPs already and they can beat you with implementing new features, because all they need is to update firmware, while you have 2 year of porting ahead of you.
@_date: 2014-09-24 11:01:26
This is 100% safe. There is no single "setup passphrase". When you setup or recover trezor, all you need is seed. Then, every passphrase generates a new wallet and this passphrase is guaranteed to generate the same wallet for the same seed even after recovery.

In case of web application (html+js), you can check how it works on the github I posted and then when you use it, you can see that your browser has indeed downloaded the same html+js.
In case of Trezor firmware, you can build it using Docker to get the exact same binary you download from the firmware repository.
You don't need to trust place you downloaded firmware from, because firmware is signed.
In theory you don't even need to trust manufacturer and the shipping chain, because the device is blackbox testable (thanks to it's deterministic nature) but there are no such tests (I know of).
Bottom line: Stop being paranoid. It's all checkable so please don't warn about non-issues. Better propose solutions to these threats (if you have any proposals).

The question is not whether it "could be intercepted". Answer to that question is "YES, it could".
The question is, whether the device is trustworthy and the answer is again "YES, because there are ways to prove it's both not backdoored and genuine". 
And the question is also whether "most of these devices are or are going to be subbed" and the answer is "No, they are not going to be, because government can easily monitor blockchain without the device being backdoored. Government intercepts other types of devices. It does it to monitor network traffic, not to steal peoples money. Also, subbing such simple device would be found easily putting even worse reputation on government that it already has. Government is going to sub more difficult devices where the backdoor cannot be found easily."

You choose the pin length. It is up to 9 digits. When you forget it, you can still recover your seed without pin with mnemonic.

- 347
- 218
Your computer will display a 3x3 grid of clickable question marks. You click bottom left and top left question mark to enter your PIN.

1. Both your use cases are a good reasons for buying two Trezors. The question is whether the benefit is big enough for you to pay twice.
2. When million of people have trezors, the probability of two of them having the same seed is less than a chance I think of one atom in the universe and you guess which one it is.
3. There is a limit, but I'm not sure about how big the limit is. Password of usual strength is sufficient. There is no need of 100chars. There is an online website from intel that tells you how strong password is: 
4. It is included. However it does not make private keys more secure to the outside attacker. Passwordless private keys are as secure as those protected by the password. Password adds another layer of security to protect you against somebody who has your Trezor or your mnemonic words

I doubt it is possible. Even if kernel was not communicating with the device, the device itself still sits on the bus.
Related off-topic: Did you know that PCIE devices have full access to the computer memory? If you are signing transactions on (offline) computer, you better check all you PCIE devices firmware (closed source) for backdoors and bugs. I assume that this is the same for Android.
So the only way I think this can be done is making a single purpose Android device without those interfaces present. Those won't be produced at large scale, thus they will be just expensive Trezors still with many more attack vectors.

It does not have display so it is not safe to use it on a single infected computer.

No, it's not possible to use "the same types of rooting attacks people use to jailbreak iPhones" because these attacks work only because it's possible to run 3rd party software on the device BEFORE it is jailbroken. That's the inherent problem of the complex devices. You wouldn't like your iPhone if you were not able to play Angry Birds on it.

You still have access to it, because you hold the Trezor account for which this change address was generated. The way you can check you have this access:
0. Please note that this tutorial is 100% safe BUT the owner of bip32.org will know all your addresses so you may decide not to do this if you don't want that! If you still want to check, then proceed. (You may download bip32.org website and do this offline if you wish to keep your account privacy)
1. Go to mytrezor.com main account page and click "Advanced details"
2. You should see "Account public keys (XPUB)"
3. Check that your account key you see there starts with xpub and it's indeed a public key.
4. Go to  and click on "BIP32 Key" in the "Derive From" field.
5. Enter the key into  "BIP32 Extended Key" field
6. Choose "Custom" for "Derivation Path"
7. Enter "m/i/1" into "Custom Path"
8. Enter "0" into the "Keypair Index (i)". (It's called keypair, but since you provided xpub, you won't see private part)
9. You see the first change address in "Address" field. It should match your mysterious address that you did not authorize.
10. You can see any change address editing the value of "Keypair Index (i)" (they are numbered from zero, so to see the second one, just enter 1)
Edit: Please note that with myTrezor you don't see these addresses, because Trezor manages your change automatically so you don't have to. There is no real need to see these, because you should never use them consciously. I agree that it would be nice to see them in myTrezor though.

Mabe Dude misunderstood what I said. I was not clear. I was talking about importing private keys of your other BTC addresses. Importing such private keys (for instance your existing paper wallets) is not possible, because for a given address you cannot generate seed. Restoring the device can be used to replace the seed entirely and I know about it. BUT it cannot be replaced without a cooperating user. Trezor asks for words in a random order and asks for wipe confirmation. So if a malicious software or greenwallet wanted to import the seed into trezor, the only way it can do it is by first telling user what to import and then let user do it based on the instructions on a trezor screen. I would never call this "write to device".
@_date: 2014-10-15 14:44:15

- The private keys that RSA company had were stored on the company servers, owned by them and provided to the government. The private keys in Trezor are stored in the device that is owned by the user and cannot be provided to anybody by SatoshiLabs.

yes, you can, but not all word combinations are valid. see this standard: 
Edit: Not all combinations are valid, because there is a checksum appended to the entropy. You can compute sha256 of you entropy, but this cannot be done by hand. Alternativelly, you can try a lot of combinations and for the longest possible mnemonic, one of 256 is valid ;-) for 12 words, one in 16 is valid.
Note: Trezor uses external entropy when generating seed, so easier and more secure way is to provide your entropy via this channel. The seed is then created as SHA256(hardware_entropy||provided_entropy).
Note2: Using your wordlist to "recover" the device significantly reduces the security. The problem is that 12 words of 2048 is 2048^12 entropy, while if somebody knows your words(keylogger) and has to just guess the order is orders of magnitudes less possibilities. It's still hard and not worth the effort, but it is significantly simpler than guessing your seed without this info.

How come it is safe? It cannot be hacked because there is no operating system to be hacked and the single purpose code it is running can be verified by a single person.
Why is USB secure? USB is not secure, nor securer than the PC. It is the combination of hardware and software that makes it secure. USB is just the means of communication. In your other post you linked USB security problems. These just don't apply to this device.
Isn't the need for a web interface to make transactions a potential weakness? Nope. All blockchain transactions are public information. Web wallet can work with public information without any risk. The private information does not leave the device.

BTW: My humble opinion is that hardware wallets are either:
- as private as the computer they are used on
- OR extremely user unfriendly
Also, please note that the concerns were risen against the web wallet, but improving the privacy of the web wallet would not be the answer to the  privacy of the user computer thus it would not solve the problem...
Peter also suggested that Trezor team shouldn't have started to sell devices until the fully private wallet was out there. I disagree with that. Without a product in the market there would be no incentive for third parties to include Trezor support. On the other hand, it would take ages for Satoshi Labs o develop a private software wallet that, given their resources, would never match existing solutions features-wise.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:49:32
Are you trolling? Every serious wallet would test with RFC test vectors... Trezor is testing them. And unlike RNG attacks, this one would be revealed with every single test vector. 
Moreover, all BTC signatures are public in the blockchain so if something is stolen you can actually go back and track what the signature was and whether it was what it was supposed to be (again an improvement compared to RNG signatures).
@_date: 2015-01-18 16:07:08
My opinion is that user private data is much more likely to leak because of the malware on user computer than because of myTrezor. AFAIK, SatoshiLabs don't store any personal information.
Because of this, I don't think the concern agaist myTrezor matters that much. In fact, if the user was sure his computer is not compromised he would not need Trezor in the first place... If we assume that user is not sure that the computer is not compromised then the Electrum privacy AND security is zero.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:42:42
The life of Trezor should be mostly limited by the lifespan of the flash used. This should be somewhere at 15 years if kept at 60 degrees Centigrade and above 100 years at normal temperatures (22 degrees).

The timing attack is a non-issue. Yes, the library has it. No doubt about it. I would never use it in multi-threaded environment of a web server. But exploiting it in trezor is just impossible. You would need the device to sign the same transaction thousands of times and capture precise timings.
To do it remotely, you either don't have the precise times OR you can't force user to sign same thing over and over again or usually both.
On the other hand, if you steal Trezor, you cannot sign transactions at all and if you could, you don't need to attack anything anymore...
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:43:09
If you do recovery twice, you enter 24 words first, then you enter another 24 words during the second recovery. If the attacker catches both recoveries, he can intersect the two word sets and that gives him your 12 words. 12! is not many....

For software wallets, you can build the code yourself. For hardware wallets you can do the same, BUT using such unsigned firmware is a pain.

What kind of innovation do you have in mind?
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:34:03
What new attack surfaces are you talking about? This RFC generates secret k which has the same uniqeuness properties as the randomly generated one.
Does Armory have deterministic signatures?

I don't accept tips. I had this app allowed by mistake and I have just ignored it, but now I received over a dollar for the first time so I disabled it and returned the moneyz. But thanks anyway, much appreciated.
It's up to those clients to implement initialization or not. It's completely up to them since nothing prevents it... You can already initialize it with the Trezor command line tool so myTrezor is not really a requirement.
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:08:02
The article has some details wrong:
- Trezor supports multiple accounts
- AFAIK Ledger is not open source
- Trezor supports altcoins and was sucesfully used with Electrum LTC 2.0 beta to send LTC. In fact you should be able to store LTC, DOGE, Namecoin and Bitcoin on a single device on separate accounts (provided Electrum supports them, because myTrezor wallet probably won't)
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:26:37
Your post there talks about "rigged RNG" which is funny when talking about almost completely deterministic hardware wallet. That's why you got rightfully downvoted.
Please note that "almost" above refers to wallet initialization where even rigged RNG provable cannot decrease your security while good RNG can improve it.

Basically you use HD (BIP32) wallet to generate all your addresses from one seed. This is employed in Trezor. It also creates a public key for your individual accounts. This allows faster account balance/history discovery and it also allows you to import such a key into a watch only wallet like myTrezor Lite. On the other hand, it allows attacker who gets hold of your public key to keep track of all your transactions having kind of watch only access to your wallet as well.
There is a trade-off between the privacy and usability here. If the device would not export the xpub, but only individual addresses, then watch only wallet would not be possible and the wallet would be slower (maybe significantly slower)...

In theory you don't need computer as there is an lib for Trezor on Android but there are no Android wallets yet...

What kind of confusion does this clear? In fact I'm confused not only about how this relates to this thread, but also about what kind of security issue peter talks about. How this UI behavior or Peter's misunderstanding of how Trezor firmware upgrade works make this clear?
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:06:26
I agree with all what you say here. I object only against the innovation point you raised earlier. I also see SatoahiLabs lowering the price and doing less of innovation in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-17 10:07:09
Ah sorry, for some reason I thought the person whom I was replying replied me back.
I did not ask how "one could use RFC6979 for an attack" but how this creates NEW attack vectors. Shitty programming is not a new attack vector and it's easier to detect it when doing deterministic signatures. Because of that I would say that RFC6979 mitigates this attack vector instead of opening it as a new vulnerability as you try to claim.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:19:18
Trezor needs human interaction, while automated exchange maybe needs full software controlled wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:09:00
Most if not all USB sticks and other USB devices have flashable firmware that can be changed by ANY software. The Trezor firmware can be flashed as well but only signed firmware is accepted thus you always know what firmware is your Trezor device running, but you can never tell which USB stick is malicious...
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:37:32
Afaik, in Electrum, you have better control about where this public key goes and basically it does not go too far. While in myTrezor, it goes over the net to a closed source backend server and, if I understand correctly, this is what Peter is criticizing. However, this is not a problem of the Trezor device, but rather a result of a lightweight web wallet design. In the future, you will have option to use the device with privacy oriented wallets that keep xpub from going to the internet. Some people are already using Trezor with Electrum 2.0 beta.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:25:07
FWIW Trezor started shipping last summer so it's 1/2 year old and the firmware 1.3 which brings multisig was released 2 weeks ago. SatoshiLabs is still heavily investing into the development for the future firmware improvements...
Anyway, my point stands: It's not an innovation to not do any innovation.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:15:10
I used to contribute to the project, but not anymore. Now I just write comments from time to time...
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:51:29
You wrote that "RFC6979 could actually open up additional attack surfaces" which is simply not true because the malicious coder can screw both rng and rfc6979. That's not new. Some other, really new, attack vector?
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:45:10
I have read it twice, but I think that Peter's comments were properly answered by slush there and there is nothing more to discuss, or?
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:38:01
The discussion you linked is useless. There are no real security concerns raised against Trezor there.
90% the article you linked is about not trusting RNG and bragging about not having deterministic builds. Let me tell you something: Trezor employs deterministic RFC6979 compliant signatures (i.e. no RNG) and has deterministic builds.
The rest of the article is ad on BitKey which in my opinion is not secure. For example: if you plug USB drive into the PC, it's not really air-gapped anymore: 
If you still think that some concerns from the article are relevant, please re-post them here so I can react, but I'm not going to react to the 10 pages of mostly nonsense.
@_date: 2015-01-19 17:09:02
I've recently replied here about some privacy concerns: 
Even thought the OP mentions "security" as well, there were no security concerns mentioned there...
I've heard some concerns related to social engineering, production/retail chain but none of those are specific to Trezor. Those are some valid concerns users should be aware of like not buying your personal bank from your local mafia etc., but that's hopefully a common sense.
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:16:32
Show me successful attack in laboratory conditions or it did not happen.
Edit: My point is that DPA is impossible due to the usage pattern and SPA is hard. Not impossible, but hard. So show me the attack and it's cost so we can consider whether it's worth for the attacker.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:24:00
In this case, the lower price is a result of the lack of innovation... It's not like they invented something what makes product cheaper. They just did not spend a dollar on innovation and that makes product cheaper. This can make them rich, but not because of their innovation.
Edit: Don't get me wrong. I don't think this is wrong for the customer or Bitcoin. I just protest against calling it innovation.

They ship to Canada from their own site. It just takes longer:

What's wrong about it? The least number I've seen for a succesful lattice attack is 2000 signatures with the same key and that's in a special multithreaded case. Usualy it's 16000+.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:10:50




I would say no, if the wallet is passphrase protected. Otherwise yes.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:12:44
Depends on whether you can physically secure the device and backup words from your enemies and your loved ones. If you can do that, then without passphrase it's OK (my current setting). If you can't do that, then you need a passphrase...
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:06:06
If you are looking at the time period in which Alice and Bob just initialize wallet and deposit to it, then probably Bob is more secure.
But when it comes to spending, Bob becomes extremely vulnerable. First of all, his paper wallet does not use deterministic keys so he was reusing addresses a lot which is not a good practice. The second (and bigger) problem is that Bob now needs a BTC wallet to sweep his paper and sign transaction. At this point Bob becomes less secure than Alice.
@_date: 2014-09-30 09:33:45
Government can track blockchain online. It's public information. The only thing not public is your private key that Trezor protects. The only plausible explanation of governments intercepting such packages is to steal money, however the only legal obligation government has is to monitor the obscure money flows.
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:43:15
They don't recommend it because when you forget your passphrase then nobody can recover your coins...
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:56:30
The most secure and the most expensive one.
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:37:44
There is no issue for Trezor and other software wallets with deterministic signatures. The whole attack is based on manipulating RNG which of course does not work if no RNG is used...
@_date: 2014-09-02 09:53:02
This is very interesting. I hope they try it and publish their findings. 
But the fact is that with Trezor, when you sign a transaction, you send all your BTC from the input addresses used to a change address. The address remains empty. DPA can reveal the private key if it's used many times. But after just first signature of outgoing transaction from address X with Trezor, the address is empty afterwards and there is nothing to steal.
But still, thanks for posting!
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:12:35
In a sense, Trezor is very different from the other trusted third parties. I think that you are not "wrong" saying that but the comparison is not correct.
It's like comparing a fiat bank to a fiat wallet manufacturer. You have to trust bank to manage your money well and trusting wallet manufacturer to stitch pieces of leather and fabric together is a different type of trust.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:00:43
1. If someone has your seed backup words, he does not need PIN.
2. If someone just grabs, your Trezor, he either needs to know the PIN or be very lucky to guess it. To have a better idea of how hard it is, take a look here: 
3. If you have a passphrase protected wallet, thief would need to know/guess passphrase as well independent of whether he takes trezor or seed backup words, i.e., seed words without passphrase are useless.

Let me give you an example of what I mean. Let's say you have a DVD image with the live linux you use on the offline wifi-less, hd-less computer for BTC. If it's from a malicious source, you think you're still fine because you run it offline. You are wrong. The device running this OS can spend periods of time computing something power demanding and then be a idle for a while. It can send your private keys through the power usage pattern in binary or morse code or whatever. How do you know it's not doing that?
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:27:53
It's more secure, because it's easier to reason about it. With trezor you have a certain guarantees that the software you are running is genuine and that the device does not do anything else.
With offline computer you don't have many of those guarantees. If you are not tech savvy, you probably can't answer some of these questions:
 - Is the version of Armory/Electrum really genuine or is it a Armory/Electrum mocking malware?
 - How do I make sure that the computer is really offline and forever will be?
 - What other software is the computer running?
 - Can the software that is running on this computer activate it's communication capabilities?
 - Is the USB dongle that I use to transfer data to and from the offline computer really a USB dongle (
With Trezor you don't have to worry and you don't have to care.
