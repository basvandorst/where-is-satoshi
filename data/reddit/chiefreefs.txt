Everybody over age 40 tells me this. They either don't know the definition of ponzu scheme or they don't know what bitcoin is.

It's safe but they'll report you to the IRS if prompted

Is there anything from preventing you from getting a job now? Even a supermarket job of maybe 10hrs a week would give you the cash to buy some coin. I had a job starting my sophomore year.

Damn man, I'm sorry about that. America seems like a shithole at times but comments like yours make me appreciate living here. 
If you ever get a wallet I'd be happy to float you $5 worth ��

You still get what you paid for originally, despite the delay.

To be fair, selling bitcoin could enable him to travel further.

If you get audited by the IRS Coinbase is far from anonymous so they'd have financial evidence that you profited off bitcoin. They recently were court ordered to turn over 14,000 users information to the IRS - these users all had over 100,000 in btc profit, so it's unlikely low level btc owners will ever be bothered

When the price goes down due to market fluctuations. Look at the correction back in 2013 for example

After a year it's considered a long term investment and capital gains tax isn't applied. Or something like that

If you buy at $10k, even if it takes a few days for the funds to Get moved over from your bank account, you'll be locked in at the price you bought at (10k). If it goes up, you get profits, if it goes down, you get losses.

It would have been nice to have that explained to me at some point during the login process. Thanks for the info, though!

It would be nice if I could sign in. I've gotten no emails, and e try time I try to sign in it just refreshes the login page. The app still doesn't recognize my username and password. This is frustrating.

Red pull would take me back to 2005. Dealing with middle school would be shitty, investing in bitcoin in high school and having to swoon my gf for a second time would be interesting.

Nah! I'm trying to have my current life, just with millions of dollars in btc lol

Being a child prodigy in college at the age of 12 would alter my timeline slightly too much.

The coin exists, it's just a matter of finding the key on the computer
