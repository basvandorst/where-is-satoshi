You, or anybody else that is interested in political reform towards democracy ought definitely check those links.  I find Delegative democracy to be superior to direct democracy for several reasons:
Like was mentioned above, everybody is not going to have an opinion on everything, and to expect everyone to vote on everything is an overwhelming level of involvement for some.  With Delegative democracy, and i believe the software implementations of such like the Pirate Parties LiquidFeedback, you can do something like 'i trust ricks opinion on the environment, and sarah on education, I'll vote on gun control issues personally.  Then you're fully involved in politics but your attention is only taken by those issues you care about.
And then put voting on a blockchain to guarantee against ballot stuffing.

I think it's more likely that someone will mine for some fees (even if not massive) than it would be that someone would wait unnecessarily for a transaction.
@_date: 2015-05-25 22:03:42
PaulRevereware; Increased hashing power grants a miner better ability to find a nonce.  Finding a nonce allows a miner to create a block.
Seperately, the blocksize increase is being discussed due to the projected volume of transactions exceeding a threshold which could delay confirmation time by creating a backlog of transactions.

When fees are increased through artificial scarcity, the backlog in transactions effects the usability of bitcoin.

I keep thinking of all the musicians on record stating that downloading has hurt them.  Clearly, a person with a vested interest will represent that interest even if against the best interests of the community as a whole. Yet people are still making music, and those in a position to profit or find balance (buying coin with kwh) mining bitcoin will continue to do so, long after all those who headed west like the gold rush and bought pricey shovels have capitulated.
  At this stage of the project, the fee pressure could negatively impact adoption.

Mining will find its equilibrium, transaction numbers, and thus fees, ought to be higher if this thing gains traction in the long term. Maybe people won't mine on the grid in hawaii (.33 kwh) or maybe even they won't consistently buy mining equipment that costs more than the return.  Or maybe some people will just keep throwing cash at it because they enjoy 'mining'.
Isn't more transactions in a block more miner fees?

While the inflation by the charts has been done in a seemingly controlled fashion, it appears for most people is the US they've been slowly moving downward over the past few decades... for example, now two parents often have to work to raise a child. 
Unemployment statistics are bogus, and I wager with things like food inflation 'being hidden in tinier bags' that the standard line on inflation is a bit bogus as well.






So if people _en masse_ save for purchases at this point of QE, it would cause an economic downturn...? They should use debt to purchase their goods to move the economy forward?
Thanks for giving clarity in your responses - I'm still going to have to read more about economics because currently my gut reaction is still that inflation is a tool for a few against the many.

If anything is to liberate people from poverty and inequality, It would be the _general advancement of technology created for the benefit of everyone_.  A part of that would be banking for the unbanked majority with a finite money supply. (given that an infinite money supply lent freely to plutocrats reduces the value of the money held by everyone else, thus increasing poverty and inequality)
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:57:25


If prices are raised for goods because the additional currency _devalues_ the remainder of the currency where then is the increase in value? 
If a tootsie roll costs 1 cent today, and the money supply gets doubled tonight, and the tootsie roll costs 2 cents tommorrow, can you say that those 2 cents have more value than the 1 cent of today?
@_date: 2015-04-29 03:27:44
I don't believe I said anything about price stability harming or benefiting people, please allow me to reiterate my claim: _Technology created with the intent or effect of empowering the individual no matter their economic situation is the best hope standing to lift people out of poverty and inequality._  Perhaps not so much eliminate inequality but rather to raise the baseline.  Are you familiar with the bent of technology which I am trying to describe?  
In America where I live, I do realize that most of us are incredibly rich in comparison to other places in the world, yet that does not negate the fact that the gap between the richest and poorest is widening at an incredible rate.  The money created by the inflation serves a few, at the expense of all who hold money.  The super rich hold stocks and realty and such far as I know.
