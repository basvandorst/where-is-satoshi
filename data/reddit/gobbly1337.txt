I deleted my reply.  It was in a tone that appears to be more a result of miscommunication than a real disagreement :)
My OP was terse, the elaboration is: "In the late 80's and early 90's the internet had questionable commercial value.  Fast forward a few decades and it's been the single most significant creation of most of our lives."
Cars were like this too, had been around for decades but until the tech was improved and the infrastructure arose to support them, they were more a toy than a world changing phenomenon that they became.

My transfers of bitcoin into GDAX took the same time it would have taken to confirm any BTC transaction.  An ACH from them to my bank takes 24 hours.  That's been my experience.

I paid ~$40 to transfer $17k across the world and it took about an hour.  That beats about any non-crypto alternative I can think of.

I can't point you to a reference, but search google for "zombie bitcoin".  Short version is that hard disks die, people die, people forget passwords, wallets get lost.  Bitcoins held by lost keys are effectively unusable as long as the underlying crypto is secure.  So there will never actually be 21M bitcoins in circulation, there will be 21M minus some unknown increasing lost quantity.

Technically the ability to transfer on the block chain was created out of the work done by miners to maintain that blockchain.  Just because something isn't tangible doesn't mean it's nothing or created from nothing.
As a CPA you should appreciate the ability to maintain a distributed ledger that is indisputable.

Purely anecdotal, but replace 'blockchain' with 'internet' and you have another valid headline :)

Most (legally operating) exchanges will have tiered limits.
A realistic example may be:
$500 a day self-reported (or maybe 0).
$5k-50k with some verification (ID upload is common).
More if you request it and go through their process, which may include questions about how you acquired the funds/coins or research into your funding addresses, and possible requests for documentation to backup your claims (think bank statements).
Expect that once you go through any formal verification process, any large transfer is going to be reported to your tax authority.

I agree that everyone cashes out at some point, but due to fear?  No, there are a lot of reasons people cash out of investments that have nothing to do with fear.  Perhaps you're projecting your own personal experience on others?

It's certainly a concern that doesn't get talked about outside of the immediate financial implications of the profitability of mining.
The poor scaling of the energy consumption is due to the proof of work, but that's not the only possible implementation out there.  Take a look at proof of stake and proof of burn for some alternate ideas.  POW is certainly the easiest to implement in today's ecosystem, and is the most used.

I'm saying that as time goes on coins become inaccessible (lost), and no one really knows how many coins fall into that category now, nor will they in the future (though we will become more confident as time marches on and coins stale).  That would make it difficult to value your coins as a simple ratio of those available.
In the end a BTC is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  It's utility is in its ease of transactions and record of those transactions.  You can't eat it, you can't ride in it, you can't wear it, in the end you have to exchange it for something of value in the real world to make it have value to humans.
As time marches on more keys will be lost, and with them the coins they hold.  Take that to it's limit (at infinity), and eventually all coins become lost.  More 'real-world' it's likely that at some point we will develop technology that will allow efficient solutions of the underlying problems the crypto is based on, which will break current implementations.

All I see is an analysis saying that it would take ~117 days to turn a profit on an investment of 1.75 M in mining (@ 15k/coin).  That assumes your math is right, which I didn't bother to check.

If I were you I would put out the word for a commensurate reward on return of the laptop with data intact.  I wouldn't give any hint of the real value, don't make the reward too high, make it enough to be enticing compared to the hundred or two it might be worth on the street.  Do it quick, before it gets hawked.  Make sure you give them a safe way to exchange, their first thought will be that it's a trap.

They are stolen by someone using the private key that controls them to transfer them to a different key (address).  In other words, it's not possible to 'steal' coins, it's possible to 'steal' keys and use them to legitimately (from a bitcoin protocol perspective) transfer bitcoins.  This assumes the protocol is working as intended, for instance, it's possible to launch a majority (51%) attack and as a result alter the transaction log against the specifications of the protocol.  There are safeguards in place to reduce the risk of such an event, but the risk is not zero.
Implementation errors could also introduce vulnerabilities that may allow altering the transaction log, though at this point there are no publicly known vulnerabilities in bitcoin core that would allow altering of the blockchain.

Go to a bank to wire $50 and see what it costs you.  There are different mediums.  If you were transferring significantly more you may find the fees are reasonable.

You could say the same thing about a lot of technologies that ruled supreme at one point or another.  If the world was run by what was technically best it would be a very different place.  Often it's just whoever was first, or whoever had more access to capital.
I can relate though.  I struggle with putting money into bitcoin because I am constantly thinking about the deficiencies, thinking about how it could be done better, and looking at other coins that bring improvements.  But I also understand that it's often not the best solution that wins, and bitcoin is still the clear leader by enough of a margin that it's going to remain that for the foreseeable future of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:20:33
And hope it doesn't go down, which these things have quite a history of doing.  Volatility and unplanned tax events can wipe out capital in its entirety.

Exchanges are going to make their money, often times by imposing fees on filled orders.  You just have to look at the diff exchanges fee structures and decide which fits best into your strategy, then incorporate that into your evaluation.  You have the same considerations when arbitraging.

Small amounts of btc can be a pain, not sure I'd put that on my family/friends who are generally ignorant about it.
When I asked my mom what she wanted for christmas she joked that I could give her btc, but when I pointed out that she wouldn't know what to do with it, she agreed.

Read Santoshi's whitepaper (  Bitcoin was created to solve one very specific problem, preventing double spend in a distributed transaction log (decentralized ledger), as stated in the abstract: "We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network."
There's other aspects to it, and lots of other 'features' that have been added to cryptocurrencies (though not always bitcoin), it's evolved beyond the original vision of those who fostered the technology, but at its core that was the problem that bitcoin was originally designed to overcome.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:40:07
Correct.  The capital you invest (principal) has been taxed already (presumably), and therefore is not taxed again.  Another way to look at it is that it is not the 'gain' portion.  You are taxed on gains, not on the principal invested.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:01:26
GDAX definitely does limits (GTC, not sure what other options they support).  It does work.  It's a fairly basic operation for a market, along with market and stops.

It's theoretically possible (though your numbers are way off, it would take a hundred years or longer), and in a vacuum and given that time horizon, actually makes sense.  Simply continue to buy, printing whatever USD it costs you, and eventually you will control all the accessible coin.
This breaks down for a lot of reasons, but probably the biggest in my mind is that the US has a lot of obligations in USD, and if we make too blatant a move to devalue it (say by printing a lot more of them), we carry serious risk of conflict with our debtors.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:29:23
I'm not the poster, but I have an answer for you: It depends on your perspective.
From the perspective of the blockchain (the protocol used to manage it), addresses cannot be modified, hidden, or redirected once they are writing in the chain.  There is one caveat: a majority attack, if successful, could undo transactions.
From a users point of view, your input addressing or client application could modify/hide/redirect addresses without you realizing.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:37:35
It's possible, and that's the rub.

Let's say someone gives you $300k, and you spend it on 300 widgets @ 1000.  Widgets go down to $300 (70% drop).  The govt comes knocking for their $100k cut of the $300k.  You liquidate your widgets @ $90k, and still owe $10k in taxes.  That's the situation folks are talking about here.

Talk to a tax person who has some experience with crypto.  It shouldn't cost you a whole lot.
My understanding is that until recently (next year?) altcoins to bitcoin were considered equivalent (1031 exchange), and were not a taxable event.  Again though, find someone who has professional experience with this and find out for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:44:35
Or years.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:38:11
I have to agree with the part about reporting it.  If you've held for the long-term, you may not even have to pay tax on it if you're income isn't high, and if you do pay tax it's going to be capped at 15-20%.
If you lie and get caught, the consequences will be serious, likely serious enough that you would pay the 15-20% to avoid them.
The idea that bitcoin hides you is hogwash.  Bitcoin is like a bank publishing its customers statements, removing the name, but leaving the account numbers.
My faith in someone asking how to launder money on reddit and going on to do it successfully is low.

Fleece in what sense?
Bitcoin transactions are certainly not free, so if you consider fees fleecing, then yes bitcoin will fleece you.  Though though unlike a bank, it's easy to figure out bitcoin fees and you have some flexibility in what fee you pay.
If, instead, the fleecing is being done through things like reordering transactions to maximize overdraft fees, or opening up account without your knowledge, then you're safe with Bitcoin.
With all this, keep in mind that Bitcoin is part of a very young technology, it certainly has, and will continue to have some growing pains for the foreseeable future.

We have quantum computing currently, and it has not broken 'crypto', but it will eventually.  This is a concern for all crypto really, not just currencies.  It's a dire looking situation but do consider that despite that, govt's are still using it to store the most secret of secrets, and outside of currencies the amount of capital protected by it is counted in trillions.  The entire crypto industry will undergo a dramatic transformation, and cryptocurrencies will be just a small part of that (by today's adoption).

There's a pretty big disconnect between a purely technical evaluation and the way the markets act.  I think that's the case in most markets, but with crypto I think it's amplified a lot by the fact that there just aren't that many people out there that truly understand the tech.
