Hell, I completely missed 12k, that was damn quick.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:47
And now it's 16k again. Buckle up everybody!

It looks like that 16-19 run spooked a lot of people because it's back at 16 again. I got lucky there and sold at 18.5.

In reality it's a little more complicated because you can sell your end of the contract to someone else, so you may not be making the deal, but rather buying a portion of someone else's deal.

Dude, that's unaffordable to the vast majority of the world's population right now.

I think I won, I sold a bunch at about 18.5k near the peak and made back pretty much all of my most recent investment.

Was that something that was in doubt?

Only because the Fed is boring.

Futures are a way to speculate. Two people agree to trade some commodity at a price determined beforehand, at a future date. 
So say I have 1 BTC at 17k right now. I think it's going to crash and want to get rid of it. You think it's going to soar to 50k. So we make a deal; you agree that no matter what the market price is in a month, you'll buy my BTC a month from now for 25k (less than you think it'll be worth and more than I think it'll be worth). If, in a month, the price is above 25k, you win, because you're getting a discount (and I also win because you paid more for it than I did). If it's crashed, you've just paid 25k for something worthless (and I've won because I've dumped a worthless asset for 25k). 
Options are the same thing, except you don't have to buy if you don't want to, so the margins are quite different since the risk for the seller is much higher.

Damn, I wasn't even close.

I've pulled out pretty much as much USD as I put in. Sure I might be losing on gains later, but now I've moved enough back that even if BTC goes to zero I won't really have lost anything.

Still applies.

Coinbase locks in the price at the time of sale. So whatever the price is when they deliver doesn't matter, you'll get the number that was on your screen when you hit "confirm".

Generally, the price is locked in at the time of the buy/sell. So if you sell today at 16k on Coinbase, even if the money isn't transferred until next week, you'll get the price it was going for when you confirmed the sale.

Ah, so you're the one responsible for [this](
