...dumbest statement I've seen today.
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:33:54
oh cmon.. now you are just changing the argument.  Let's stay on track here.  You said "they don't" but now you are saying "they do.. but not as many as the US".  Seriously.. this is Captain Obvious stuff right here.


And by far the majority of US citizens do not use TOR either.  What is the point?  I'm arguing against you saying "they don't" when they obviously DO.


I never said it was "common".  I just said that there are people getting on Tor from China "all the time".  Even if that is .0001% of a 1.4 BILLION users (not common), it is still happening all the time.  I don't think in any country the Tor project is "common".  The majority of people are either downloading porn or journalists and reporters in China fighting the good fight to get their voices heard with no filtering from the government.
Want stats?  Have at it.
It's not like I don't know what you are trying to get across.  In China it is WAAAAY harder to circumnavigate the governments attempts to block their citizens than somewhere like the US which has NO blocks.  That has always been the case and it is plainly obvious.  I'm only talking about the subject at hand and your comments that people in China "do not" circumnavigate their way to TOR.

like DUH.. no.  Coinbase transaction is not automatically a suspicious transaction (all of mine haven't been) Maybe you should learn how banks work kid.. 
You aren't required to notify your bank of ANY transactions... that is only used as a measure to make 100% sure is accepted in a situation where the charges are vastly different (like you leaving town).. When a fraud department gets a flag on your account.. YOU get notified.  Plain and simple.  If his account gets FROZEN for a small charge that looked suspicious.. it doesn't matter what type of account it is, they are required to notify you.
...so your comment once again.. is stupid.  He wasn't "banking irresponsibly".  If you think that way.. then you either don't have a bank account or have a bank account with some no name local bank which means ...you are the one banking irresponsible.

It's ok.. if he wasn't being such a butthurt cocksucker he could have been a little less dramatic about it all.. but then again.. username.

they didn't get "everybody" to have one kid.. don't know where in the world you are getting this shit from.

While that in itself is 100% correct, it is has nothing to do with the topic at hand.. which is whether or not people can and will bypass "The Great Firewall" because they can.  You say "..you live in China, you don't" which is ignorant because THEY DO.  Speaking out against the government is not the same as getting around TOR blocking.
You say "you underestimate the Chinese....etc..etc.." but doesn't change the fact that people are bypassing "The Great Firewall" ALL THE TIME.  So in regards to underestimating the Chinese government, I don't think we are in this case.

no.. Well you might make it back in 10 months to a year.. but without anymore information of what kind of rig and how much hashing power it will have, I will say no, at least not with what is available right now that you can buy and receive.

I am not saying that you would not be able to. .. Please read what I am saying.  The price of bitcoins and the faith of the people.. would be way too low.  If it is accepted by all counties like the us just did (the point of this whole argument).. the price will go up and so will people's faith in bitcoin (like now... 1000k a bitcoin).  If major countries do the opposite.. local bitcoin sales in those countries would be scarce.. since no one would be able to claim taxes on them it would technically be illegal.

My advice to all "gamblers" is..
It isn't gambling if you expect to lose the money.  If you can't think this way then DON'T play.  If you can't afford to lose money you put in, then that is where it becomes gambling.  
When I go to the casino, I look at it as an expensive form of entertainment.  That when I go to sleep that night I will have paid ~300.00 in entertainment.  I will not spend over that.  If I win, then I win.  If I don't, then I never really "lost"
Some people can't keep that rule.  They see their money sucked out, or they get greedy and start betting bigger.  Then you find yourself chasing your loss and you will never catch it (statistically speaking).  
Same as an alcoholic or drug addict thinking they can party for one special night after being sober for so long.  Statistically speaking.. they will most likely be back to their addiction if they even try it.

From an end-user perspective, you would want bitcoin to survive and for there to be a massive adoption of bitcoin all over the world.  Your comment was "Bitcoin's success will be hinged upon businesses/people accepting it."  Keep in mind the subject of this is whether or not it will reach $5000 per bitcoin in the future.
This isn't about whether or not the US "embraces" bitcoin.  This is about whether or not the US will keep their financial institutions from doing ANY transactions with bitcoin exchanges or whether or not the banks will allow a bitcoin related company to receive a loan or get the appropriate documentation approved to startup.  If the US made it outright illegal, companies like bitinstant, coinbase, etc..etc would be NO MORE, and similar non-US companies would most likely stop doing business with US customers.  Companies like Paypal would not be able to accept payments from known bitcoin services for US customers, and most likely would have to stop all together.  It wouldn't just be "Well, the US doesn't embrace it so lets keep the status quo that buying and cashing out bitcoins is complicated" It would be "Well, now the US is absolutely against bitcoin and you will NEVER be able to move funds from your bank account to bitcoin exchanges"
Would "YOU" still be able to purchase bitcoins and spend them and have items sent to you from countries who DO accept them?  OF COURSE.  Is the average US customer going to even give bitcoins 2 seconds thought if it takes this amount of time to actual purchase or cash out bitcoins?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Hell, average Joe Consumer isn't even close to utilizing bitcoins in a life impacting way.  
a $5000 price on one bitcoin is based on the possibility that the world (specifically superpowers) will start to officially accept bitcoin as a currency, thereby helping bitcoin related companies and services gain traction.  
If bitcoins are extremely easy to buy and spend for everyone, and suddenly we find that companies like Western Union are going down the drain because Bitcoin is the new preferred way to transfer funds, Only THEN will we see 5000 bitcoins anytime in the near future. 
In my opinion though, this would not happen at all if the US did to bitcoin what they did to online poker.  I'm not saying that it would KILL bitcoin, but I could not see the market for bitcoin being so large.

God I hate it when people call people "kiddo" on the internet.  Such a dickish comment
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:47:09
South park covers issues that are hot topics that everyone can relate to.  They won't focus a whole episode around something only 10% of people know about.   Maybe Awesomo could think of a better movie idea that actually works..

Incorrect.. The terms of service are against the selling of preorders.  IF you don't have it in your hands when you are ready to sell, it might get cancelled. 
I think they also have problems with people buying actual bitcoins on ebay.  I could be wrong about that part though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:19:07
Sorry.. got to disagree with this 100%.. not just the comment on the sidebar but the whole idea.
The answer to this questions is entirely based on what you think the future of bitcoin holds.  I personally think we will see $1000 bitcoins by the end of November, and I wouldn't doubt 5000 in Q3 or Q4 of 2014. (my opinions, not grounded in any fact).  Some other think it will correct, and we will most likely see 250$ bitcoins within the next month.
I recently sold my two miners on Ebay. 1x30GHs bitforce and 1x7GHs bitforce.  I purchased them for 750 for the 30gh and 250 for the 7gh with money I already mined with my 2 GPU's in my gaming computer.  I made about 13 bitcoins in the time I started mining with the miners.  I sold the miners for $1300 and reinvested into bitcoin at 200$.  I already made a profit, and I am sitting on about 15 bitcoins (after some stupid alt coin purchases).
With that story said, I was determined that purchasing bitcoin is way better than mining and I did just that.  The person who has my 30GH/s device right now will make a half a bitcoin in the next 2 weeks, and most likely will only make about 3 bitcoins in the next 6 months max due to the dramatic difficulty.  I would say 3 bitcoins at the current rate of ~600 is damn good considering they purchased the 30gh device for ~$900 (200% profit?)... but that is where what your view of bitcoins makes the difference.  IF I thought that bitcoins were going to tank back to 200$ or so, then mining is NOT profitable.  BUT, if I thought the price hits 5000 by Dec 2014, that person who is holding that 3BTC could make 15K!  And even with RIDICULOUS difficulty of something like 60 trillion, you are still looking at .0075 bitcoins a month which would be about 40$..
..so yeah, with all of the possible directions this could go, the answer to that is even further from being realized.
..nuff said

I'm pretty sure this absolute comment is wrong.. Sure the US won't be THE reason bitcoin goes to 5000, but what just happened today HAS helped bigtime.  This along with other countries agreeing that bitcoin is a good thing is what will get businesses on board.  Businesses would having no ability to help the world of bitcoin if the major governments of the world declared the currency illegal.  If EVERY US or other world power bank kept people from depositing to and withdrawing from their bitcoin exchange account, money would not be able to flow, and no businesses would offer bitcoin as an option.
