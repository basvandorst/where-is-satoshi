almost everyone there will say you should invest that money, because you can "always" get 8% in the stock market and mortgages are way less interest than that....

I'm not saying that gold used no energy
 I'm saying if we are building a new financial system then sustainability should at least be thought about as a consideration. It shouldn't be top consideration I believe decentralization is top but don't those go hand in hand?  If large cetralized farms using lots of energy is the only economical way to mine maybe making changes to lessen that centralisation can also lessen energy usage

Many congrats. Some people may be saying this is the wrong move, or there are many people in that say you shouldn't pay off your house. But I got some stock options ~7 years ago and paid my mortgage. Best move I made. The emotional comfort I get from knowing that i OWN my home is huge.

Holy shitsnacks!

you wanna get a poll aggregator like 538 or another site. That site has very open methodology. And yeah, I think  they gave trump a 30% chance of wining electoral college.
And yeah, those polls for approval , I seriously doubt the methodology has changed much, if at all. So if you just got one poll (say, the gallup..   you can look at it comparatively between presidents. 
So, yeah, there really isn't any doubt. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:22:27
Yeah. And TDD (test driven development) is awesome for any project but especially such a security focused app where mistakes could be catastrophic.
As a dev but no knowledge of this code
 base or language frankly , I had to decide which side to back. I went by the fact that those backing things like segwit and lightning where following best practices in the software field.
So i stood up a UASF node for months.
And yeah TDD is def write tests first
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:48
fair point. I'm only familiar with the US mortgage market.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:32:36
My son has one of these. A manual with no options. It's s damn good car and side airbags saved his ass inan accident so he got another .
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:51:20
What? Maybe because he's toxic as hell?
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:49:52
please stop the political bullshit here. No need.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:31:39
I will say, I tried to run a BU node for a bit, just to see the usage. It was a darn lot of disk space, and , more importantly, bandwidth. I have plenty, but it would cause me more and more problems with cap.
The more I read into this, segwit seems the way to go, but they appear to be losing on the ground.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:52:24
... and to think people say this subreddit is toxic ! /s
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:14:15
yes. not the original solution in the white paper. you wanna do something else? don't call it bitcoin. Go make your own.
edit: I'm done with you folks until you stop censoring opposition here.
@_date: 2017-01-26 01:59:18
Look I'm a Bitcoin noob. But it seems to me that a block has to be on the block chain or its not a block.  That seems to be where the disconnect is in the whole question.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:43:41
therefore, demand must be very low. Econ 101.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:22:57
they are not going to be on the blockchain (my client/local one) unless you are running that version with Segwit, correct? 
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:48:03
that kinda sounds like you are extending the definition of "block" because in the example above, I would say that it isn't part of the chain. The chain is whatever the greatest concentration of cpu power says it is. That is the definition in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:03:38
Also hijacking to tell those who don't know: this does NOT mean you need $10000 to use or buy bitcoin. BTC is divisible to 8 decimal places.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:23:49
Honestly this is my biggest concern.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:28:03
Take one to the front for sure
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:08:53
Also I shouldn't have said spam here. My bad.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:49:56
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:14:53
Lol. I don't need to know anything about you, as soon as you use  you lose all credibility.
@_date: 2017-04-14 14:07:55
I don't care about tumbling. Never said it was immoral or anything. I was just seconding the speculation. Literally the first thing I thought of was . Hnmmn dnmlord cashing out with a tumble ?
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:55:16
Yeah, I was wondering to myself if a large tumble would spam a bunch of transactions quick?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:51:26
What ? Ever anti vaxer I know is conservative...
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:37:25
exactly. If you doubt this, go around and ask people what the USD is backed by. A ton (well over half, in my non-scientific survey) will think it is still backed by gold.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:22:57
I guess I'm an anomaly. In my office lots of guys in 30s who watch streams. Hell I'm 50 and it's my principal form of entertainment
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:31:52
Yeah well I'm a Java guy who doesn't really know C. I would not feel comfortable even doing a simple merge in a language I'm not proficient in . Especially for a project of such magnitude.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:36:24
its weird the way the premium moves.     it definitely varies. There are times when the NAV is going down and the price is going up and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:26:04
You can do this now, at least with a fidelity Roth thru GBTC this is what I have. Note it trades a healthy premium over bitcoin price. A share is 1/10 btc but right now is $278 instead of 227 or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:51:30
Also, look at the money flowing into GBTC.. The premium over NAV is growing (Its' +$47 right now per share). People are paying a premium over the BTC price because of demand (people, like me, can buy into this in some Roth IRAs/IRAs/401ks).
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:41:51
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:27:55
Then lets see the exchanges weigh in here. That would really throw the economic weight behind it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 21:07:22
Well, you've met one now. I ran a full node (core) and just used too much damn of my cap. I have a 500 GB cap. according to the doc on   , it can use 200GB a month.
I tried, would have cost me overage charges.
Don't pretend like 200GB a month is trivial. its not.
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:50:11
yeah, some profit taking sounds like. also, way down in JPY and HKD, down &gt; -10% right now.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:47:25
That's a decent chunk of my roth  IRA. bought  :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:46:38
also, why is CEX.io over $2400? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:20:56
Why is cex.io so high? I understand that bitfinex was high because  of liquidity problems... Same?
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:29:20
Sorry, mate, completely missed the context there.
How, exactly, does a BIP get merged into the core
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:49:23
Well put.its an exciting journey. I'm enraptured watching
 Also HODL !   
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:58:06
But tldr, Bitcoin holds value for the same reason Fiat currency does: someone will give you something for it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:02:22
I'm running mine. I will eat any overages I have to. And what little coin I hodl I have moved to that wallet. Only been into bitcoin a year or so, but to me less back room agreements and compromises and more debate of technical merits and keeping decentralized this thing that could really actually change some petty fundamental shit (for better or worse, who knows?)
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:56:59
Read the links on the sidebar to start.
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:55:46
Thinking about this longer term though, aren't these kind of secondary chains necessary to get bitcoin to the next level functionally? A visa like transaction might want to hold these transactions off chain for a while to provide charge reversal options like current credit card networks do?
In short is the basic premise of things like lightning network in that they are faster cheaper but less "expensive " technically ? Sorry if stupid question
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:19:44
Look at the money flowing into GBTC. The premium over actual NAV is growing: 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:01:47
Kick ass!
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:24:17
Me neither. I do think the premium will come back tho
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:28:24
can we upvote ... this is beautiful :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:31:06
Can I upvote this 5 times? This gets to the heart of the matter. I'm not interested in PayPal 2.0.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:07:16
No thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:20:17
You can find info here:  You could run a wallet node signaling support. 
Note; As a newbie, you should read up on this before you do so. (requirements.. it eats a bit of  bandwidth and disk space). More importantly make sure you REALLY know what you are doing/committing to before using this wallet to store coins in. I don't want to mislead you.
However, if you just want to spin up a node and support  that's not a huge deal. There are binaries on that link (you should learn how to verify signatures for releases.. this isn't that hard, its another program you download). Basically, you want to confirm the binary you are running matches the published open source code.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:31:38
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:38:12
I dunno. Go to your roth and search "GBTC" and see if avaiable. Its an OTC symbol, may not.
I know on Fidelity Roth IRA , you can buy into this in your Roth (at least on my account).
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:36:20
yeah ITT: People who aren't developers think this is unusual! this is pretty much the same for every company I've worked for in 20 years of doing this :)
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:11:36
It's 2% expenses. As you said, kinda hefty, but not terrible.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:47:04
Dude that's not trolling it's presented in a respectful tone.
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:22:02
Whoa! cool looking project, gonna go read about this for a  bit. W3C is legit.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:02:14
I feel like I must come to his defense from ... I dunno, complete insanity? In no way whatsoever was this chat anything but professional and respectful on a questioners end. He had specific questions and asked them respectfully.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:49:16
Wallets will handle it for you is my guess.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:05:13
Yeah. Honestly the only people I know into Bitcoin are techies. At least around here, most of the programmers I know are libs. Although I know at least two libertarians who are huge into it.
Yeah I wasn't trying to pick a fight, just sharing experience
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:41:53
I love that people don't get that. You are so worried about a split ? Then I guess you better get on board. For the record non ahill non blockstream employee non Bitcoin let alone core developer. Just an investigation with 50 btc or so
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:17:41
  
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:48:12
? they are convertable to US dollars (or another fiat currency ) at an exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:24:33
I have a friend who works as a data provider for fintech firms . he says he keeps getting inquiries. Many hedge fund clients.
His question for me is what is considered thee definitive rate? Just pick an exchange? Average ?
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:55:56
Ummm. I know 3 holders besides me. They are all liberals so they will certainty profit from a moon shot :)
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:04:45
well, um, are you serious? How about Watergate for one.
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:16:11
Incidentally mods, I love having all the price talk in a thread stickied to the top with a "new" sort.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:28:11
Yeah I mean just darknet stuff alone is huge.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:29:00
Agreed. Might be my new phone wallpaper if I could get it without the text
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:14:04
You are beholden to the deep girlfriend state, free yourself from Fiat madness. Did you know girlfriends have been devalued almost 95% of their work from a centruy ago? Did you know a moderate wedding in the USA is at least 10000 USD
With Bitcoin, escort services will thrive in in a free market with decentralized trust so reviews are guaranteed to be unalterable and verifiable.
Tldr; DUMP.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:24:01
Its brilliant .. except meth is the new ASICBOOST :)
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:53:22
Yeah. I'm no econmist, but fee free trading seems pointless?
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:58:11
... Look, I'm a big fan of core devs who work on bitcoin.
... BUT, I'm not sure its fair to say "the worlds' best programmers".  by what measure?
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:55:08
Oh so the exchange charges a fee but doesn't someone have to pay a mining fee to get it on the block chain? Sorry if this is a noob question but I'm trying to learn.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:30:17
this has been explained, including this thread. Its not DISK SPACE! Its bandwidth cap. In the US, there is almost no one who doesn't have a bandwidth cap. The current core client , for instance, is blowing my June bandwidth cap as we speak! with 1MB blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:08:00
My first thought is you could open a channrl fund it and then use it for many transactions. Think of it like you buy $50 Starbucks gift card and use it to buy many coffees. 
Like I said the wallets will handle this for you
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:38:21
Trumps second term? No chance. wanna bet?
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:18:10
Indeed. Wrote a comment like this and then saw yours.
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:40:05
think of it this way: Today, your "money" is in the bank. You have to trust the bank to give it to you  when you need it, and not be broke AND/OR the government to back it (with FDIC in the US, for instance).
If you are buying bitcoin on say, coinbase or cex.io or something and leaving it there, what's the difference? Its actually WAY less safe than the bank (no FDIC or the like).
If you have the coins/keys in your wallet,  you are in control. That's bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:28:21
Oh no  wasn't implying that . Most libertarians I know are also very conservative on social issues but almost all are fiscal conservatives
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:44:05
really? I said in another comment, almost all the bitcoin people I know are liberal techheads :)
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:28:56
This is really funny to me. The only people I know into bitcoin are liberals.
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:19:13
Do they work on things? Lets find out!
