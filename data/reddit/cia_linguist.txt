I've sold all of my BTC. I was hemorrhaging money with my worth sitting in Bitcoin. I've since sold all of my BTC, bought up some Alt Coins, and in the past 2 days I've made more from hodling alt coins than I normally make in 2 weeks at a 9-5 job. Until BTC wallet to wallet transactions fees go down, I have zero interest in using it for purchases, lending money to friends, or even keeping it as a store of wealth.

lol. I think one of my highest karma comments is about how a cheap wrench from Lowe’s hardware store and threatening to go after loved ones next is enough to make just about everyone talk. Break a kneecap or an arm and they will be even more likely to tell you their private wallet info.  
  
Those idiots you see with a Ledger Nano lanyard around their neck are ideal targets.  
  
Most people don’t have wall safes or bank safety deposit boxes to store their private wallets in. And because people often buy/sell on the fly they don’t bother putting their paper wallets into one if they need to. So check under mattresses, in book shelves, taped under desks, dressers, under keyboards, or literally right next to their pc monitors.  
  
Make sure you get their Binance password and look at their phone for the text message secondary passcode to log in. Soooo many people don’t have their crypto in wallets. Because they buy and sell so fucking much they just leave their crypto on Binance and ignore putting it in a wallet like retards.  
  
Getting someone’s crypto is easy. If you have ever said to anyone that you bought BTC in 2014 or that you are a heavy crypto trader you need to fucking tell those same people that you lied. Or save face and say you paid off student loans or donated almost all of it to charity. ...Because those same friends are the ones who are going to tell their molly dealer, “o shit, cuz, my buddy has lots of Bitcoins that he buys DMT and tryptamines with. Want his number??” Your friends just got you robbed.  
  
You might think I’m exaggerating, but a chick told me last Tuesday night that her husband buys drugs off the darknet with bitcoins. I was like that’s fucking retarded. Why doesn’t he use Monero? After a bit of digging I discovered her husband uses a tumbler. So there i was, thinking that if he’s using a tumbler then he probably has a good amount of bitcoin and it might be in his best interest if his wife isn’t telling strangers that. He’s going to get robbed.  
  
lmao, anyway... just thought I’d share this with whomever will read it. You can tell people you trade crypto, but say it’s like $300 max. I understand the concern to spread the word of crypto, but don’t be fucking retarded about it. Word of mouth can get you killed if someone thinks you are rich.

Having money really can help you to get/maintain/acquire friends. As to figuring out if they are Gold Diggers waiting for you to reach $90,000,000 in worth and want you to pay for dinner or if they are just interested in what you have to say, well, I can't help you there.  
  
See if you can get them to buy like 20 or 50 dollars worth of bitcoin so you can grow old and rich together.

Yea, what a bummer. Now I have to find a new way to mine. NiceHash was simple and it had an easy to use start/stop button on the program. I 100% expect to never again see the money I just lost.

I was reading into protecting yourself after selling something like wormhole technology to North Korea for 19,000 bitcoins or maybe protecting your assets from a tyrant in a 3rd (or 1st) world country.  
  


  
How long do mixing services usually take? Is it someone doing it all manually or is it automated?  
  
If I were to tumble 19,000 btc would it be ideal to NOT introduce all 19,000 btc at once and to do it in 100 btc increments? I was reading that introducing such a large amount (all 19k at once) would taint the whole group of wallets in the tumbler.  
  
So, following this advice, I’d have the 19,000 btc in wallet number 1. Start tumbling. End tumbling with the money going into my new wallet   
  
Would I have to create wallet number 2 because wallet number 1 is under suspicion? Certainly I shouldn’t keep the btc in the original wallet number 1 after the tumbler, correct?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:44:00
I certainly find it strange that r/btc's sidebar and subreddit description gives the impression that Bitcoin is okay to discuss, but if anyone mentions it they get looked down upon.  
  
Then again, I also think it is strange that r/trees and ~~are the opposite of what you think it would be about. Trees is about marijuana and marijuanaenthusiasts specializes all kinds of different plants. I've seen some very beautiful trees in the enthusiasts subreddit.
  
~~EDIIIIIT... Well, it looks like has been overrun with discussions of marijuana. There was a time it was really a place to discuss trees and plants. I suppose I've given a bad example. It looks like the sub lacks moderators these days.~~  
  
**EDIT:** I linked the wrong sub. r/marijuanaenthusiasts is the one about plants. I accidentally used an underscore.

Is the discussion of tumbling your bitcoins not allowed on this subreddit?   
  
I am only asking because i have questions I’d like to ask in the future about tumbling. I can understand if there is a concern on the topic as those who might want a tumbler can be seen as having an interest in suspicious/illegal activities.

If they are going to grill you about the dark net, then you’ll need to be aware of the stolen art that went up for sale recently.   
  
Buying (or at least just looking at) art is one of my favorite things about the dark side of the internet. Most of the time I’ll see forgeries listed and they look almost identical if not for the difference in colors and price. For example, a forged painting will have slightly different shades of color in some or all of the painting which would be unnoticeable by the untrained eye. Also, the price of a stolen Rembrandt is around 32 million USD, but there are forged paintings selling for around $8,000 worth of bitcoins.  
  
These deals are always done with bitcoins, but that isn’t the only use for bitcoins. Yes, drugs/guns/art is bought and sold with bitcoins, but what about the legit vendors that use bitcoins?? Subway, Microsoft, Reddit, Newegg, Steam... Coffee, pizza, clothes, limousines... Some yacht charter companies accept bitcoins, some hotels accept bitcoins... Hell, even the MIT Coop Store (Massachusetts Institute of Technology student book store) accepts bitcoin!!!!!  
  
LOL, even Bloomberg online newspaper, the news entity that has been throwing shade at bitcoins lately, saying it is unsustainable, is a registered bitcoin vendor! Overstock.com, PayPal, Expedia.com... They all use it (or at least have plans to use it), too!  
  
For a cryptocurrency that is absolutely no where near its peak, it sucks that many people like to only talk about The Silk Road and funding terrorism when talking about bitcoins. Don’t get me wrong, The Silk Road is where I started getting involved with bitcoins and I’ve seen the horrible things that have sold on there, but the future of bitcoin becoming more accepted by the world changes everything.  
  
Expect to be able to buy street tacos from food trucks using bitcoins in the future. Expect to buy your Guinness with bitcoins at the pub.  
  
I suppose you can also argue that drugs/guns/art/humans are bought with USD, too. It isn’t only bitcoin that has a bad reputation. The U S Dollar has an even worse reputation.

I had to rewatch his videos 5 or 6 times just to make sure I could explain it to friends/family/coworkers when they ask me about.

I transferred money over to gdax in hopes of buying on gdax as soon as the transfer was finished. My bank says the transfer is complete and done processing on the bank’s end, but Coinbase is still “processing” the amount. I can’t do anything until it finishes “processing”. I have actually attempted to purchase any bitcoin amounts with the funds yet.  
  
All I can really do is hope it comes through soon and hope the price dips when it does, because I want to buy immediately.  
  
I didn’t purchase with my bank account, i only transferred USD over to the coinbase/gdax account.  
  
Identity and ID cards have been verified, bank account as well.

Oh shit, dude! You're a nice guy. I would have kept it. The chances it belonged to someone who sent you something in the past is highly likely. Do you have any record of receiving BTC from them in the past? Perhaps you can some how cross-reference it with your previous transactions and send them an email, reminding them to be more careful in the future because most humans would have kept that BTC and said nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:42:50
Oh, boy! I’m not able to answer your questions because I only have a minute in the bathroom at work, but Breadwallet has caused me nothing but confusion. Setting up a wallet on Breadwallet was pretty great and helpful, but as soon as those few minutes were over it was a really shitty time. My funds disappeared, it wouldn’t sync to the blockchain, sending/receiving funds was slow and tedious, and sometimes it errors out when I try to send bitcoin. SOMETIMES it would say I sent bitcoin to an address after an error happens, but the address wouldn’t receive the transaction, and it wouldn’t reapply the funds to my breadwallet account
  
It was great starting out, but I’ve moved to a Hardware Wallet since and I’ve been significantly happier. Breadwallet, as easy as it was to set up a wallet and had a passcode/fingerprint password option, I still didn’t feel like my money was safe on there. They seem to be updating it constantly, and the developers reply to the app reviews, but it just isn’t the level of service I desire from a wallet.

Google results should help you there. It is based on trust, soooo be aware they COULD try to rip you off. Buuuut you don’t trust someone with the whole amount anyway. LOL, I mean if you gave me 19000.00 bitcoins anonymously and said, “Hey launder my money,” I’d steal it without thinking twice.  
  
If you try to tumble thousands of bitcoins all at once you will “poison the well” of bitcoins and Taint all the wallets that are supposed to be cleaning your coins.  
  
Do small amounts in one tumbler, have the cleaned bitcoins go into a new and clean wallet each time you use a service. Do it over again on a different tumbler. And again on another tumbler. Go through 4 or 5 services over a period of a month.  
  
You can successfully steal 200 million dollars worth of bitcoins and never get caught if you use tumblers. There are fees, but it would be worth it in the long run. Anyone who is stealing millions worth of bitcoins already knows about tumbler services and the money stolen from NiceHash is most likely already being tumbled as we speak.  
  
I have no doubt we will never see those bitcoins again.

Use a VPN service when you access the website to create your account and buy your bitcoin. If you can photoshop a good looking ID to match a debit/credit card then you are in business. As soon as you get the bitcoin purchase, transfer to your real wallet. If you can get the bitcoin out of Coinbase’s control and into your own wallet you should be fine.  
  
Sadly, Coinbase does not accept Gift Cards (even VISA gift cards) as payment so you are shit out of luck there.  
  
Keep in mind that creating fake government issued documents is a felony (sometimes just a misdemeanor), so if it gets tracked back to you then you are fucked. Hard. There is no coming back from that.  
  
A misdemeanor fake ID crime can bring up to a year in jail as a possible sentence, though less time, such as 90 days, is common. A felony fake ID offense can result in a year or more of incarceration, and sometimes as much as 10 years.  
  
Tell your lawyer you want PBJ, or Probation Before Judgement and you’ll likely only get something weak as fuck like 200 hours of community service. Judges toss out PBJ to criminals like grocery stores throw away food that isn’t actually bad.  
  
Look up the offense in your state to see if it is a misdemeanor or felony. That might be your first step.  
  
And look up the consequences of being a felon. Like no longer being able to buy a gun or body armor. Or sufferage (you lose your ability to vote). Or ineligibility for government assistance or welfare. Or deportation. Or being unable to get a job because most businesses are extremely hesitant to hire a felon.  
  
You might be better off just stealing your parents’ wallet. Worst case scenarios are they beat you senseless and you won’t be able to sit for a week, you get sent to boarding school, or you lose all respect from your family and spend the 30 years listening to them talk about how shitty you are at thanksgiving dinners. Or maybe you’ll spend the last of parents money and they can’t make the rent and you’ve literally made your family homeless for a few pieces of a bitcoin. In a situation where your family might be living paycheck to paycheck (more common than one might think) it is a terrible thing to not be able to pay rent on time or having electricity/water being turned off, so take that into consideration if that is your current living conditions.  
  
Also be aware that the bank will call the registered phone number they have associated with the account of the debit/credit card when you try to make the purchase within a few minutes to confirm that it wasn’t stolen. You’ll need access to the recent payments made on the card, the social security number of the card owner, and possibly answer a security question like, “What is your pet’s name”.  
  
Maybe just ask your parents to let you use their credit card in exchange for your visa gift card. That might be the safest bet. They would probably say yes, especially if you explain it well!!

You can actually pay off the loan at this point and still have a significant amount of BTC!

Don’t submit a repeated request again until you have reached something like the 7th business day. I don’t know if that includes weekends over at coinbase. When you send a ticket and then send another ticket, you show up at the back of the line. AT LEAST, that is what my fellow gaming nerds have told me about working in customer support for video games.  
  
Most businesses try to respond with a goal of 3-5 business days. I’ve seen a different company it take one day and other times take 3 weeks. I guess it depends on how busy it is these days.  
  
Someone with actual experience with coinbase can really give you the answers you need. Just try to worry less until they respond.

This is a pretty great topic.  
  
IANAL, but here is my opinion FWIW. With regard to coinbase, since they hold the private keys rather than you it seems to me more comparable to a traditional bank account. That is, if you have a bank app on your phone (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Chase etc...) with a balance of $10k or more, would you have to declare that at U.S. customs? Of course not. So how would having a similar balance at coinbase differ? Also, you could simply delete the coinbase app before you cross the border and reinstall it later if you are that worried about it.
Now, if you have a crypto wallet where you hold the actual private keys on the phone itself, or you have the seed phrase for such a wallet in a file on the phone or on a sheet of paper, then that would seem to fit the definition of a "bearer instrument" where the physical holder of that instrument is considered the owner of it and would consequently need to be reported if the value in USD was above the limit.
Just as another data point for reference, there was a recent story where U.S. customs reportedly seized a traveler's bitcoins at the border but he was already a suspect in an ongoing investigation.
  
  
————————  
  
Another point of view is: You don't own Cryptos. You simply have access to them with a private key. You own private keys. Cryptos are owned by their corresponding blockchain. You are not a blockchain, you are human.  
  
—————  
  
But just move your bitcoins to an app exchange like coinbase, delete the app, go through customs, and redownload the app after customs. There is no way they would find out you own bitcoins.

That is one super cute puppy! Is this your first doggo? A few tips that I'd like to share that I seem to be slacking on or that I've learned over the years.  
  
1. Don't forget the monthly heartworm medicine. Set a reminder on your phone that goes off once a month.  
  
2. If you bought this dog from a store, take it to the vet ASAP. I've seen pet store dogs die one extremely quickly. Be concerned if you hear a weeze/cough or it is extremely lethargic and just wants to lay around instead of being an active puppy.  
  
3. Either watch a bunch of dog training videos on YouTube or sign up for classes at your local Kennel Club!  offers an expensive $500 membership that lets you watch videos online to help train your pups. She's the top doggo trainer in the US, according to my GF.  
  
4. Make sure to take lots of photos. [Like this!]( Or [like this!](  
  
5.  has dog food/snacks/toys/beds/leashes/collars for cheaper than almost every pet store I've ever been in. Look into it. They will ship it right to your front door. Benebones are what my doggos like to chew.  
  
6. My 2nd dog was potty-trained extremely quick, but the first dog... It took that little shit head a year and like 4 months to stop peeing/pooping in the house.  
  
7. Dog Walker apps for your phone. Look into it. It is pretty cool for when you're at work late.

I’ve been checking coinbase like every hour waiting to see a very large money transfer clear. It has been many days since I initiated the transfer and I’m almost ready to tear my hair out. I could have just used a credit/debit card over a multiple days (because of the $750 per day purchase limit) and made back the fees spent from the rise of BTC since the date I originally initiated the transfer.  
  
I regret not doing just buying with a credit/debit card, but I also regret using Coinbase.

The Ledger Nano S and the Trezor are both really great! Personally I feel the Trezor is shaped strange, but at the same time the Ledger Nano S is really really small.  
  
I picked up the Ledger Nano S and it is pretty easy to use. There is an unofficial subreddit for it, too. I wouldn’t be surprised if Trezor also has a sub. Check out those subreddits.  
  
If you google Ledger Nano S vs Trezor, you will see some pretty good comparisons.   
  
I just want to note that the Ledger came with a small little keychain tassel thing so you can put it on a lanyard or next to your keys and walk around town flashing it to everyone. Never do that. That is like putting a target on yourself. Also, it is kind of fragile. Sit on it wrong and you will need to buy a new one.  
  
If you are buying bitcoin I highly recommend getting one of these two big players in the field of cryptocurrency security.

I’m glad you’ve decided to make a positive change in your life. What I recommend to people is, IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, drop 10% of each paycheck into bitcoins. Any time you want to buy some drugs or booze just to get fucked up (excluding buying a bottle of wine while on a date) then take that money and fucking buy some bitcoin. Even if it is only $10 worth. If you were planning of buying an Oz of bud, buy bitcoin instead.  
  
Don’t dump a whole paycheck into bitcoins if you have bills/food costs/dependents because that is a risky decision. Just a few dollars here. A few dollars there. Only spare what you don’t *need*.

OP! You're walking around with giant **₿** on your forehead. You're a target.  
  
Things that cross my mind when I see someone wearing a Ledger Nano S in public:  
Maybe you can afford losing it and buying a new one cause they are crazy rich! Bitcoin holders have lots of money these days...  
Maybe you are too stupid to hide your wealth...  
Maybe you are a big-time bitcoin trader and you need it on you at all times cause you day trade with other people's money...  
Or maybe they are just a nice guy who's showing people how bitcoin works and really only has a few dollars in it...  
  
All it takes is a thug to know what a Ledger Nano S looks like before you get snatched up and threatened for your private wallet keys. Usually just the verbal threat of violence is enough to get someone to give up their private keys. Sometimes just the sight of a wrench lightly rubbing against their kneecap like it's ready to make sweet passionate love coupled with the attacker's ecstatic smile is enough for someone to spill the beans.  
  
Only when bitcoin becomes much more mainstream will I ever consider wearing a Ledger Nano S around my neck. Until that time comes I will keep that shit in my pocket or locked up. Think about your safety and your family's safety before walking around with a flashy **₿** hanging around your neck.

I tried to buy $3 worth thinking I could just buy in small amounts here and there instead of on cigarettes/coffee and the fees were 1/3rd of the total amount I was buying.  
  
**A 33% fee** for buying at the minimum amount was not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:29:59
Coinbase is a dick when it comes to fees. I'm guessing you bought like $3 worth or something, right *(don't tell me how much you actually bought)*? I bought $3 the other day just fucking around and the fees to buy are 1/3 of what I bought. So I ended up only getting around $2 worth of bitcoins. If I were to send it to my wallet from coinbase they wanted to add more fees. Fuck that. Transfer the money to GDAX and send it to your wallet for a smaller fee. And in the future use a different exchange. [Here is a list of exchanges](  
  
Someone on this subreddit once said: Coinbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters (BBVA) and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.  
  
Coinbase has already shared information with the government in the past. I have absolutely no doubt it will happen again.

Keep the security words it in a safety deposit box at a bank or a wall safe in your home. Definitely do not keep it under your mattress or in a random box in the attic.  
  
Or write a shitty novel and publish it for free on Amazon’s publishing service and name each chapter after a word from your secret poem.
But I usually keep the hardware wallet with me in its box or in a special drawer at home. It is delicate and will break if you sit on it wrong or if you accidentally flush it down the toilet.  
  
If you re-enter the poem you can once again have access to the wallet you created.

No. Sending bitcoins from a Coinbase account to a Trezor hardware wallet, for example, is only a transfer and not a sale since the user is still in possession of the coins.  
  
Where you hold your BTC - paper wallet, hardware wallet, online wallet - is irrelevant. All that matters is that you declare the holding, if required, and pay any tax due when you liquidate the asset for national currency.

There are ways to receive bitcoin anonymously.  
  
----------  
One way is to buy locally. Give someone cash, and they give you bitcoin. It is best to do this in person. **Do not ask them who they are or what they are going to with the money. this is the whole point on anonymity.** Do not show up with a weapon and start waving it around, that makes you appear untrustworthy and could in turn get you hurt by someone else who may also have a weapon. Hurting people is bad. ^^And ^^crazy. YES, bitcoin transactions can go wrong and someone can try to rob you. This is a risk you have to take to stay anonymous. If you keep a hardware cryptocurrency wallet like TREZOR or Ledger, you can limit the risk of theft. Afterwards on the other hand...   
  
Anyway, you can make a wallet anonymously online and there are websites like  that helps you to find people interested in purchasing/selling locally.  [Like THIS person who wants to buy $20,000 worth of bitcoin with cash in Kansas.]( Do a trade like that in a public place where there are cameras. Like at a bank. A bank where you can deposit the $20,000 USD cash immediately after having it handed to you because you have an account. Most banks have some pretty good security cameras. You can literally sit in the lobby, make the transaction on a laptop (if you have one), and collect and deposit the money into the bank. If an employee asks questions, just say that you're about to make "a very big deposit" and they usually will let you go about your business.  
  
OR, you can BE that guy who is trying to buy bitcoin with $20,000 USD in cash. You can give the seller a fake name, tell them you're setting up a college fund for your niece who was just born. Doesn't matter what you say. Just be aware that they might try to take your cash and run, similar to is you were the seller and they take the cash after the transaction completes. This is why being at a bank lobby is the best option. Security cameras can help identify who kills you.  
  
Or you can do it in a starbucks on the free wifi and hope you make it out alive and richer. It's just like doing craigslist purchases. They are shady man. Craigslist 101. I'm not saying everyone is out to kill you, but people die over a $50 crack rock in the hood. $20,000 at a an Olive Garden parking lot is no different.  
  
-----------  
  
The ATM method:  
Another way to buy Bitcoins anonymously with cash is to go to your nearest Bitcoin ATM and buy Bitcoins from the ATM using cash. Buying Bitcoins via an ATM is probably the best way to go about buying Bitcoins anonymously however not everyone has an ATM next to them. When asked to enter your Bitcoin address at the ATM just specify that you don’t have one – in most cases this will just generate a new paper address for you and you’re good to go. Later on you can import the private key from that paper wallet and send those Bitcoins wherever you like.  has a list of ATM's.  
  
Honestly, I seen a bitcoin ATM in years so I'm not sure if that is still how they even work.  
  
--------  
  
A lot of websites, if not most, are going to ask you for ID. Google Tumbling Bitcoins is a way *around* tracing getting caught spending your bitcoin on less-than-popular things. [You'll find a Wikipedia article]( and then a ton of of other results. It is a great idea to understand Bitcoin Tumbling if you want to make anonymous bitcoins.

I’m pumping in 10% of each paycheck into bitcoin, but only because I can afford it. That is the same amount I would have spent on cigarettes in a week (I need to quit anyway...). If i find myself wanting to go out to the bar on a weekend to get fucked up, I’m going to take that extra $30-$40 and pump that into bitcoin instead. I will just stay home and play video games.  
  
I would not recommend getting a loan. That is a massive risk on investment. Yes, I believe bitcoin will more than double in the future, but that is absolutely not a reason to risk everything. If you pump $€10,000 into bitcoin and BTC dips down to less than what you put into it before you can get returns on investment, then you are fucked. If you were unable to break even then your life will be significantly harder than it is now.  
  
Do the safe path that another poster suggested. Invest what you can, when you can. I’d rather live with some extra cash in my pocket than to be $€10,000 in the hole while already barely making it in life. I think if the worst case scenario happens and you are unable to pay a loan payment every month then I am 100% against what you are suggesting.  
  
But hey, if you want to invest everything and take loans, then go for it!! There IS a very likely chance you could have a ton of money by the end of next year.

This is important to read if you are just getting into bitcoin now. It is stickied at the top of the page if you view using a computer (it doesn't show up on my reddit mobile app).  
  
I recently purchased a [Ledger Nano S]( and plan on using that as a [hardware wallet]( I recommend googling the difference between the the ledger and the [TREZOR]( before picking either if you plan on ever using a hardware wallet. You aren't required to use a hardware wallet. The only reason I need the hardware is for job security purposes as I find myself plugging into virus infected computers on a weekly basis.  
  
As others have mentioned, Google is your best friend when it comes to creating a wallet. Worst case scenario, and I mean *WORST CASE*, you end up downloading ^Breadwallet on your iphone and they help you to create a wallet there with the 12 word poem security and everything. Breadwallet isn't perfect and I don't like to use it because of that, but creating a wallet on there is kind of like "easy mode".
