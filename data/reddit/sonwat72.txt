Yes i think so. But you could use a light wallet like Electrum to store your bitcoins and connect it to your full node while you have it online. Then you can use other peoples full nodes while yours is offline.

You can run a Full Node if you have enough space (145+ Gb).

If you take your node offline it will have to catch up with the blockchain when you start it again. This could take a long time depending on your processing power.

Yes, they are used to bind transactions to block headers.

If all the addresses are part of a HD keychain, some explorers let you enter the xpub and view all your addresses

SegWit is being used more than before and will keep the fees down for some time. Bigger blocks might solve the scaling problem temporarily, but it would also cause a lot of new problems.
Developing new systems like segwit and lightning is better for the network than just increasing the blocksize every time the network is slow.

A pool is multiple miners acting as one, for shared profit. The miners control the generation of new bitcoins and new blocks in the blockchain (regulated by the network consensus).

Pure SegWit addresses actually start with "bc1"

Just replace the executeables with the new ones.

Yeah, as long as you are using a version provided by someone that can be trusted (like the "official" versions of Bitcoin Core), there is not really anything to be worried about.
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:27:09
A block has been mined with an undefined versionbit. While this could be a sign that a soft-fork is ongoing, it's probably just someone creating a block with a weird version number. Either way you should be fine as long as you are using an unmodified version of bitcoin core.

lntip is a bot for donating btc over the lightning network.

Yes, but you can add a passphrase to the seed in some wallets. Then you have to enter the seed and the passphrase when you want to restore your wallet.

Bip39 defines a new type of seed that can have additional words (the passphrase) at the end of the seed.
