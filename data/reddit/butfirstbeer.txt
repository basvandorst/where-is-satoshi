Can someone explain to me why Coinbase fees are so much higher than GDAX fees despite the fact that they are owned by the exact same company?

People thought there was a bubble at $100  
People thought there was a bubble at $1000  
...at $5000  
...at $10000  
Nobody knows if this thing is going to explode next week or continue steamrolling to $50,000. We’re all making educated guesses based on the information out there to buy, sell, or hodl.  
Do your research, figure out why you’d want to invest (or not invest), and stick with that decision.

Right, so we should have no new buyers. Makes sense.

Forget this guy. Put in what you can afford, when you’re able to afford it, and HODL. Welcome to the party!

Relax man, new money is what pushes the price up.

The Ethereum community does this and it’s awesome, especially on days like today.

And those people have to start out as new money, right?

Please don’t do this.  
Nobody knows where bitcoin is going to go. It could go to $100k, it could go to zero, or it could stay at $10k forever. No one knows.  
Your 401k allows you to be financially secure in the future and the time horizon is huge. On top of that, most companies offer matches which is free money.  
If you want more money to invest in bitcoin, sell something you don’t need anymore, do freelance work, or take on a second job.  
Don’t put your future at stake on a highly speculative investment.
