Hardly anybody knew what bitcoin was back then, there was clear euphoria in december.

Bitstamp has very high trading fees compared to other exchanges.

That fud post is part of the reason why it crashed.

They have some of the highest fees there is.

Be aware that Tone Vays don´t have a good track record with his predictions, he was bearish during 5-8k and was telling his followers to sell at 11k also. Follow  for a more bullish trading perspective. Also  for some stupid polls and bullish thoughts on btc.

hm ok, but here it says youbit, with link to their homepage, I can't read korean: 
And here: 
Actually there's several if you google youbit hacked.
So seems it's youbit (not yobit lol).

Never understood this argument. If forbes evaluates Donald Trumps properties they don't say he has 0 value because he didn't sell it. It's just another means of storing value, and btw IRS don't say you have 0 value either, it's real profit. It's a really poor argument people say to those holding shitcoins that have lost a lot of value like "you haven't lost anything even though it's down to 1/10 of what you purchased it for cuz you didn't sell" Newsflash, you lost 9/10 of your investment, there are people holding chaincoin to this day due to this silly argument.

Didn´t see any trolls, just people who disagreed. Disagreeing is not trolling.

Wrong. It was Yobit, which is smaller and not affiliated with Bittrex. Upbit has not gotten hacked.

The fact that you wrote "nothing to stop this from continuing" exposes this post for what it is. That claim has no basis in reality. Bitcoin fud posts always gets a ton of upvotes on here.

Tone Vays should be sued for all his lies about tether. Nobody should listen to anything he says.

Bitstamp does not deserve all this praise for fees. They have some of the highest fees for trading. 0.25% on both sell and buy orders. On gdax this is 0 unless you are the taker.

It had a small dip due to Bill Gates FUD and will now continue up.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:00:58
It seems to me that you sold and therefore want the price to go down.

This man is a shill like many of the cryptocurrency youtubers. Several sponsored videos and streams pumping some coin, he even collabs with suppoman. Be careful of these youtubers because while they might have some good videos about news they will mix it with shillng icos and shitcoins.

Wrong. The bottom was in at 6k and btc went below and back up to the mean trendline, which is where it is at now. The recent small pump went above mean.

Bill Gates screwed IBM to get rich.
