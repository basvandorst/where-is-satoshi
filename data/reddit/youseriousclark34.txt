Like a normal credit card in the sense that you spend fiat currency. However, instead of receiving cash back as a reward, you receive crypto back. So you'll earn 1% of every transaction in Bitcoin or Ethereum and the funds will be stored directly in your digital wallet hosted by blockrize.

You are able to send your crypto to other wallets

Credit card rewards aren't actually viewed as income by the IRS. Instead they're classified as a discount which isn't taxable.

Monaco's lowest tier card doesn't actually offer 1% cash back. While its 2nd lowest tier card does, it only offers reward in the Monaco coin which limits consumer choice. Also, in order to get the 1% cash back card from Monaco, you have to buy and hold 50 MCO for 6 months. So if you're extremely bullish on Monaco, it may be the card for you. However, if you're not as bullish on Monaco, the blockrize card offers more choice and less requirements.

Yeah it's safe to sign up. The site is secured with SSL and the name of the company is also displayed next to it (green text next to URL). Also, it's just a waitlist to get early access to apply. So by signing up, you're not committing to anything but reserving a spot in case you want to

They make money on the processing fee merchants pay every time someone uses the card. This revenue funds the crypto reward. It's how every credit card with a rewards program operates

Metal only allows you to receive Metal coin back so if you're not bullish on Metal, it may not be your first choice for rewards. Also it offers up to 5% crypto back, but caps that reward since only a certain amount of Metal will be created. Most cardholders will never see that 5% and eventually there will be 0% crypto back

Simplified this makes sense but there are a couple factors at play that lower the value of the Citi 2% cash back card.
The first is convenience due to the time value of purchasing the cryptocurrency yourself. With the blockrize card you earn the cryptocurrency as you use the card. To replicate this with a different card, you would have to log in to your exchange and purchase it after every time you use the card. Additionally, if you were to wait until the end of the week, there's a strong chance (based on past performance) that you would've missed out on gains that could raise the value of your rewards to more than the 2% Citi is offering.
The second is the fee exchanges charge to buy cryptocurrency. Some of the most popular charge a minimum regardless of the amount. This minimum is not a significant amount in most cases, however, it most likely is significant if you choose to buy an amount of cryptocurrency equal to your daily credit card rewards.

It's actually a combination of the cardholder bank, merchant bank, and the card processor that benefit from the merchant processing fee. In this case, the cardholder bank would be partnered with blockrize (according to their FAQ) and therefore able to fund the rewards program

Yes, completely legit
