@_date: 2017-12-20 23:22:34
learn this from a 14 year old.
never ask reddit for help, especially 1/2 of this subreddit, 
my dad left 1 btc and the person who helped me asked for my 12 random numbers and i gave it to him
the guy only gave me 0.2 and kept the rest 
ididnt even know i got scammed
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:20:47
i dont know how to
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:17:00

@_date: 2017-12-17 21:36:47
