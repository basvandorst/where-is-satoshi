To ease understanding of this highly technical equation: ((nocoiner-1)*FOMOlevel + HODLgang) / whenmoon

Agreed, but go for it man, if you do it then ofc crypto payment should be an option. I like the idea of a more sustainable bike but I don't know how it rides. If it rides as good as a metal bike, then I'd definitely pick the bambike ��

But that is not true dude. The physicality is in it's design. Since bitcoin runs PoW you have to have computing power to mine bitcoin, we see big mining farms to the small run-at-home node. We choose what we make real, and I want bitcoin to be real. I know there's a lot of fud and information that seems hard to look through, but such is todays world, not just in crypto. 
When I take a step back from the confusion and look at what I believe bitcoin to be, the base idea that underpins it from the beginning, then I see a humanitarian idea and it seems weird since it is money, and money is usually considered destructive to humanitarian idealism, at least from my perspective. 
But with bitcoin we have something which is borderless, any man to any man. To me there is a lot of power in that idea, especially in a divided world.
This is obviously my opinion but I always weigh pros and cons, weaknesses and strenghts and what I see when you remove the confusion (the confusion is NOT bitcoin) is largely strenght, in an idea that is clearly alive. 
I will hodl on and keep calm because bitcoin is cradling me and even if it goes to zero it was a spark that lit hope in my eye.
