'p' is a simple abbreviation for 'pence'. Much like 'c' for 'cents'. It's barely a colloquialism when it is how it is normally written.

I'm not sure I'd be happy giving it my account info to post that.  Seems a bit excessive.

I went in expecting [The Website Is Down]( and left pleasantly surprised.

Ah, now this is good info.  Cheers!

You write it like that  don't you? It's a logical progression of that. And no, nobody uses 'p' for pounds. They have a £ symbol for that.

What is my wallet, and how would I go about moving it from one client to another, should I need to? Can I use the same wallet from more than one place)at the same time (say, on my phone, through electrum at home, then have a bitcoind set up somewhere else, all putting my coins to the same addresses)? 
Also, do I need electrum, bitcoin-qt, etc open to receive coins, or is there something more efficient at play?

Just a headsup, the first (only?) video on the website (BITCOIN 2013 – THE FUTURE OF PANHANDLING) has been removed from YouTube for some reason or another.

You may find [Skude.se/BTC]( useful.  It aggregates a handful of these sites and presents timers until you can use them again.
Edit: forgot to say, thanks for the list!

I could do it again, if you like...
@_date: 2013-10-08 05:12:07
Sweet, just making sure you were up on that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:02:55
So, kind of like the Electrum client handles things (or at least, I *think* that's how it works)?

A tragic loss of human life?

That was much my thoughts, unless reddit has an API for logins, which I'm yet to hear of.  I figured that of all places, would be a little more security-conscious.

Heck, I just bought a few.  The way I see it, it's going to slowly rise again.  It won't go as madly as it did this time, but Bitcoins have already shown their worth, and the massive price drops are all fairly obviously due to the agressive trading attacks going on.
I'm confident that I've made a good investment, and if not, I'll at least be able to buy *something* with my coins, further down the line, even if I can't exchange them for some sizeable chunk of cash.
I believe in Bitcoin, but I'd also like to believe I can make a little profit, here.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:21
Awesome.  Thanks for that.

You missed the part where it isn't the standard abbreviation for pounds, just like 'd' doesn't do dollars.

I've made a grand total of 0.001 over the course of 4 days at them.  Sometime down the line, I hope to be rolling in enough BTC that I can comfortably donate back to their owners - they're the primary reason I've managed to gain as much interest as I have in Bitcoin, and it's only fair that I repay their kindness, I figure.
I'm working on doing a proper 'buy in', but trying to do this from New Zealand (and in the comfort of my own home, where possible) can get a bit difficult.  Once I can get set up on an exchange (and test withdrawals, of course), I'll be feeling pretty good, though.
