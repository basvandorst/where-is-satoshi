I wish I did, I just got my phone and my computer which is safe enough in my opinion but again it seems like no one trusts anything besides hardware wallet now. I can afford to get it but it is available worldwide? Does it really make such a difference?

Seriously? Is it /that/ important? Can you list the cons and advantages please because I honestly have no clue why it is that big of a difference

Thank you all for your response, no idea why I was getting downvoted for asking a question but I’ll buy a hardware wallet! Thank you again :)

I am using Blockchain.info as my main wallet to hold a pretty large amount of BTC. For some reason I just can't trust myself with local wallets as I am afraid I will ever format my PC or forget the wallet files. I feel that my wallet is pretty much secure with all of the neccessary security options enabled but I still would like to know why you are so against using a web wallet.
Thank you! :)

I won’t disclose the exact amount but bigger than 2 bitcoins :) (I am only 18 and I work online and I put everything into Bitcoin so that’s mostly what I have though I have some bank savings but I’d prefer to put it in bitcoin too if I could, though I still need some available money lol

Well that convinced me. Can I get a Nano Ledger S Worldwide? I heard it’s the best one IIRC. Also, is it the best hardware wallet? How do I set it up and where can I buy it from an “authenticated” site or something?
