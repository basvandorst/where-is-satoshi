Exactly. The only way it will succeed is through widespread adoption. That starts with public opinion.

So when we’ve fucked them up the arse good and proper, what’s next?
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:18:31
People who truly understand the tech yeah. Which let’s be honest..... ��

Won’t let me post.... just shy of four zero.

I saw a reply come through regarding economists, Nobel etc. And it’s disappeared.....

This is the fight for mainstream adoption. Bitcoin believers are one thing. Surely mainstream public opinion will decide whether this whole battle is won or lost?

Never heard BoE chime in before though?
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:16:37
Got my eyes on it too. Can’t quite figure it out. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:02:09
So are we saying that the value speaks for itself? We don’t need a public counter argument?
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:55:37
The price would drop for a start. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:40:41
Energy next then!
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:05:00
Yes. I get that. But the owner of the taxi company has a bigger megaphone than UBER?

Hey man, no need to apologise. One thing I love about reddit is it’s scope for debate. I don’t take anything personally online or IRL.
But I LOVE your fighting spirit!
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:58:50
We’re expecting this fight though aren’t we?
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:27:19
I think our wires are crossed. I understand the whole game perfectly. Bar the real 1s and 0s.
People trust these institutions. Surely there’s a team working on public perception? Or are we just playing the waiting game to show that all of the naysayers are wrong by addressing each stumbling block as it comes?
Am I making sense?
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:06:19
Why? What’s raised your curiosity?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:49:33
Funny, MUST HAVE PROTECTION FOR CAPITALISM! EPA, environment? Nah fam, that’s a myth. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:01:46
Well, I didn’t post for votes. I posted to highlight the fact that a highly respected (wrongly so) institution is spreading this kind of crap.
Do we not post the enemy’s position in here? I’m new :)
