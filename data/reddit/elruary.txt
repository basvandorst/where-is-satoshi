People like you amaze me in a curious sense. You communicate your "self proclaimed wisdom" to others at the expense of insulting those who don't share it. Right or wrong, it doesn't matter at this stage because all credibility is shot out the window by you being an ass.
It's one giant contradiction, one that you strongly agree, it's as if you found a bountiful planet, and on this planet you mock people in space for their inability to appreciate it. You will die and no one will carry on your philosophy. 
I can't wrap my head around it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:05:01
It's because you sound like a pretentious twat, right or wrong, work on your delivery.
No OP is not misleading, 41 days without a word is fucking too long, when you're fucking around with some other mans earnings, he has the right to call IGOT out, that's poor as fuck and they better return his bitcoins.
Otherwise from this day onwards I will spurr only negative and scam alerts in IGOTS name.

@_date: 2015-07-06 08:16:43
I hate posts like yours, condescending adds nothing, opposite of constructive.
Before you think I'm a bitcoin naysayer, know that I want bitcoin to be successful something fearce. However the concern of ops post is true. And if you continue posting the way you do that'll only detere newbies. So be more mature and less circlejerky or discuss why you think op is wrong.

Wait didn't they say, their own digital currency, where does he mention bitcoin apart from the author of the article?
@_date: 2015-09-09 03:01:38
Then, than* sorry that shits more of a pet peeve than you're, your. Otherwise rock on you're right.

I know, hence it doesn't work ;)
@_date: 2015-09-22 04:05:31
Dude, shut your trap if you have nothing productive to add, he makes more of a valid point.
That said I do think bitcoin will have its place, just not a mainstream one.
International trade for example,  what's to stop bitcoin dominating that sector.

I'm curious how you can hate bitcoin?  Sure you can be impartial and not interested therefore just ignore its existance but to hate it entirely?

@_date: 2015-02-16 06:37:07
Yeah fair enough, thank you.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:03:43
Not sure I understand your question?
I use bitcoin to buy things, if one day my bitcoin is not worth anything then lies an issue.
Does that answer your question? 
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:43:57
Bitcoin is arguably the introductory digital coin, everything new usually is toped by a fancier more polished less error proned version.
Bitcoin suffered hackings, people not taking the coin seriously many thousands of bitcoins in hard drives in landmasses. Etc etc. And also very few people still understand the concept.
In a few years time what's to stop a newer coin, introduced to people who are more educated sold on the pretense that these coins now that everybody understands it won't be lost in the garbage etc. Like a reboot so to speak. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:13:25
And that's my point, so should I continue investing in bitcoin in the thousands, or just stick to a dozen or so. I guess is what I need to decide.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:27:41
Bitcoin was a new concept, people didn't take it seriously. So you have many incidents such as the land fill, not just one. You have hacks here and there. All things avoided if there was more preparation, not so newish concept, people taking it more seriously.
Seems like a good recipe for lets start again folks and do it right this time.
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:36:58
It does thanks a lot man.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:12:46
Yeah that's true.
@_date: 2016-07-08 12:01:58
Take your tinfoil hat off mate.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:06:34
That seems to be a minor problem, lets say the gorvernment makes a coin with the same principles as bitcoin and this time their excuse is, ok now everybodies an early adopter! 
After bitcoin pioneered and spread the word of the power of a digital currency that's unaltered by inflation etc. In one swoop, we have a Bitcoin2.0 or DigiDollar probably, that will render all bitcoins useless.
I don't know it's a bother, I just want everyone to use bitcoin that's all hah.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:59:42
I WISSSSSSSSSSSSSH it gets cheaper, so I can freaking buy a bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:40:03
