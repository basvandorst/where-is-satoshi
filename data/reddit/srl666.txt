Mind telling me why it is a scam? Or give me a link so i can read something about it myself?

For the average american? Yes... everytime i post something on reddit they automatically assume im american. So wierd, as if all other countries are irrelevant

Just enjoy the ride. Nobody can tell you when to sell.
You can either lose 1000$ or make more profit.
I'd go for more profit, but thats just my opinion. 
If you are already scared then sell now.
Cuz im betting my 0.02 Satoshis on you selling as soon as it dips;)

Nobody is talking about America here :)

Doesnt the price of a kidney depend on where you live?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:07:07
Where? Link pls! I am expecting a 5 star hotel with all inclusive.

Dont know about the rest but i am currently just enjoying the ride.
Also everyone says that you should only invest what you are able to lose. That being said i could cash out but im just to greedy to cash out now. I will cash out ~2 BTC once we hit 25.000 € and keep the rest till im happy with what i got... or lose everthing :)

GREAT! brb going to get some kidneys from Amazon so i can sell them on the darknet.

God damn... if i had more bitcoins i would ask for your btc-address to donate a little bit... Stay healthy and positive OP &lt;3 love you.

What about a no fee crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:12:19
To cash out everything? 100k +
@_date: 2019-03-15 09:44:35
But that would be a lie...
@_date: 2019-03-15 10:49:33
Yeah but the other guy lied twice... at instant and free
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:28:04
just to clearify if i had 1 bitcoin before the fork, i got 1 extra BCH after the fork for free?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:57:41
care to explain?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:27:32
What do you guys think about this? Is it a good thing that we are able to trade Cryptos on an App that is backed by the German Stock Market?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:37:07
A new App where you can buy/trade Cryptos while the whole thing is backed by the German Stock Market (Stuttgarter Börse).
What do you guys think about it?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:06:00
Well this App makes it possible for you to buy on different exchanges while you are getting a better bang for your buck, because the Stuttgarter Börse made deals with the exchanges (they cover fees, no trading fees, etc...). That should result in cheaper Cryptos for you. Yay?!
It also has a realtime Crypto-Tweet-Radar, dont know much about that thing tho.
The site is really new!! (came online yesterday)
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:18:35
english is not my first language please bear with me...
with being backed by stocks i just meant that this app is being backed by the Stuttgarter Börse. nothing more nothing less
