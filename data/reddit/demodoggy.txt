My wife is not into investing or technology.  She's into cats.  She says I have "Bitcoin for brains" - because I talk about it too much.  But I did teach her one thing - if anyone asks her about Bitcoin, her one and only response is "Hodl to the moon.  Lambos."  (I laugh when she says it, cuz to her it's just random words.)

I feel terrible for you buddy, thanks for sharing - hopefully you'll save someone from making the same mistake on their next scam website.

Right, of course, thx.

Does anyone else feel that the API's should be removed from Coinbase/GDAX so bots can't have so much control over the action?  I agree w/ the article that a huge amount of the volume of trades are done by bots, and that these bots not only arbitrage trade across platforms, but also within platforms across altcoins.  The charts for ETH and LTC (and now BCH) mimic BTC... is the true, organic trade action getting buried by immediate bot trading?

Amazing street art, bravo and congratulations!  I live in Los Angeles but hope to visit Paris in the fall of next year, I hope this street art will still be there, I'll plan to visit it!  If I could ask a couple of questions, how long did it take you to paint this and did you have to get permission from someone to use this wall? Thanks for sharing!

Yes - this right here.  Opens up crypto to a broader audience and seems bullish for Bitcoin (and other Coinbase cryptos) long term.

Holy shit dude, stay strong!!  Get yourself an awesome new video game, great distraction from BTC &amp; drinking.  Good luck!

As a simple example, you can explain the ability to send $1 Million worth of BTC to someone on the other side of the planet for around 2 bucks and it would take less than 30 minutes (at the time of this writing) - directly from one person's wallet to another's - totally secure, encrypted, etc, and without banks, middlemen, or borders.  The global ramifications of this are vast.

Hirji says on Day 1, the Coinbase Index Fund is available to accredited investors and that "over time, we would hope very much to expand it to all investors..."    We don't know, and he didn't say, that it would be open soon to everyone.

Haha!  Much awesome.

We are all sexual intercourse. We are so sexual intercourse. We have redefined the definition of sexual intercourse. Why do I invest in this coin in the world? Mom always tells me to find a job, don’t use drugs, don’t do bitcoins, I don’t And see where I am now
