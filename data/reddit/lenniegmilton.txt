I disagree with the comparison part. Your points are valid but there is no need for comparison with alt-coins and it looks defensive.

Yes, but electrum , com (the scam site) is the first result you get if you search for "electrum pro".
Very easy to mislead people if you somehow make the search for "electrum pro" (for example by tweeting or reddit posts that mention it as "pro")

yep, you are right.

OpenBSD is implemented in C. Along with the majority of critical crypto applications (OpenSSH), the Linux Kernel, Apache and... Bitcoin itself (Ok, C++ but memory management is the same as C and you actually have extra classes of attacks like smashing the VPTR)

It is actually 2048^8 which is a much smaller number, although still quite difficult to brute force.

I think you have it reversed: Something can be distributed but not decentralized (for example Google's infrastructure or power generation on a country with a single national electricity provider).
But for something to be decentralized (in the sense of central authority) it has to be distributed at least to some extent.

This doesn't make any sense. Fees are a competitive market based on sat/byte, miners don't require a specific USD amount to mine your transaction.
Satoshi/byte is the only meaningful way to judge Bitcoin fees.
