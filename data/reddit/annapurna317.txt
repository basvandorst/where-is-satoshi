For the majority of non-technical users exchanges and wallets provide the safest way to store coins long-term.
Whether or not that exchange flops is really a matter of luck, but that's built into Bitcoin as a risky investment.

A lot of smart developers believe in an on-chain blocksize increase alongside Segwit/LN future scaling. 
I guess you're saying that Peter R and Gavin Andresen are idiots? Can you give us your PHD in computer science credentials + decades of developing to back up your ability to make a judgement like that?
Stop the name calling. It looks bad on you.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:51:17
I still think we need larger blocks though. :)
@_date: 2016-08-23 18:34:10
Because there are less users now than in the future
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:47:24
If they keep a channel open by deciding not to close due to large fees, those fees can increase over time so they will have less choice. 
They would also be less likely to open a channel and even less likely to use Bitcoin at all if fees get to a prohibitive level for transactions less than $100 (the majority of transactions).
It seems like a very mathematical possibility - that's all I'm saying.
It also decreases the likelihood that Bitcoin can serve poor and unbanked individuals who deal mostly with micro-transactions (less than $2/day).
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:04:39
Can you explain this more please.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:35:18
Due the way you act on here, nobody will ever take you seriously.
@_date: 2016-08-25 18:57:22
Yup. This is exactly correct.
Bitcoin's bottleneck has become the max blocksize. The max block size was always meant to prevent spam attacks, but that issue has been fixed.
Bitcoin DOES scale with modest max blocksize increases over time.
@_date: 2016-08-17 15:12:46


In the future, if users increase this will not be possible because at any given time there will be way more people trying to transact than the blocksize allows. Immediate high fees will always take the place of low-range fees. You're counting on low-volume periods.
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:56:20


Typical ignorance
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:32:51


Block space will always have a fee variance (delta) and I didn't say that it wouldn't. What I said was that there will come a point where there will no longer be blocks that have space for low/no fees, which means unconfirmed transactions will continually build up due to more demand than blockspace supply.
RBF was meant to solve this issue: it allows those unconfirmed to submit a higher fee and fix their stagnated transaction. However, RBF allows something similar to chargebacks before the transaction has confirmed.
The thing is, even with RBF, with more demand than blockspace supply you will always have some people that may never get a transaction though. 
If 50 people want to get on the bus but there are only 20 seats, the price for each seat can go up and up, but at the end of the day only 20 people can sit down, 30 have to wait. So then the next bus comes and there are then 60 people there fighting for those 20 seats.

You should read back about what I posted, a legitimate concern and a request for technical answers and then re-think the way you threw the baby out with the bathwater and started crap-throwing.
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:42:25
Correct, but in this case people will just decide to not use it for small purchases of $100 or less (the definition of small may change) because they know beforehand of the inherent risk with high fees. 
Also, if payment channels stay open for years due to high fees, those fees can increase even more as time continues. It could be a bad situation.
I agree that a working LN network is beneficial even if there are cases like this.

proof: 
@_date: 2016-08-16 18:57:48
Sure, I'm saying 10-20 years from now with the constraint of a fixed blocksize that never increases and further optimizations like Segwit and Compact Blocks having already been added.
There will be a point where you can no longer optimize transactions in the current fixed blockspace. When that happens, as more users attempt to settle as Bitcoin users grow (as they must) there will continue to be an ever increasing fee market that will increase the fee price in a linear way as user growth happens. 50 million users -&gt; $50 fee (rough)
Thanks for hearing me out. My main reason for posting is to get an explanation from someone currently developing the LN to say that they're working on preventing this issue.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:29:53


You're a total mess. Your clearly defending yourself because you jumped straight to troll when many people also believe this to be a concern. 
Not being able to discuss serious issues is a threat to Bitcoin. You are the embodiment of that threat.
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:29:20
Yes, unfortunately at this point Bitcoin's development is controlled by Blockstream. 
Blockstream claims benevolence, but that "benevolence" includes no longer listening to the demands of a majority of users for a modest max-block size increase. That benevolence also includes turning Bitcoin into a settlement network rather than keeping the peer-to-peer electronic cash vision directly on-chain. They prefer off-chain 2nd layer scaling and that means we're all stuck with it whether we like it or not.
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:53:54
Yea, I'm excited about Segwit
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:10:44
I guess you want the 21million coin cap increased like he does? Or you want the halving delayed too - another proposal he made?
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:40:55
Many newcomers will be disappointed when they realize the network's 1MB limit will delay their transaction for hours during peak-times (even with a large fee).
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:01:15
I think 20-30 mins would be acceptable for my use case and for person-to-person transactions that seems okay. I'm not talking about buying coffee. I'm thinking a larger purchase of some kind.

It was a question based on growth and economics. Any individual interested in Bitcoin would understand it as a legitimate question, but you're a troll so you just dismiss anything as stupid.
You're the nut-job, cupcake.
@_date: 2016-04-26 02:44:52
Gavin has been nothing but honest about his opinion and kind to all of the other developers. He's not fear mongering - and he's probably right - so you might want to let go of your ego and listen to someone smarter than you.
When blocks become full during off-peak hours and the mempool can no longer decrease the entire system breaks down. We haven't hit that yet, but we're not far off.
At the very least, Gavin deserves respect for his work that helped bring Bitcoin to where it is now.
@_date: 2016-04-30 15:55:30
People have said that but the switch process would take longer than expected. Other cryptos have problems: less secure due to less users, universally unknown to people outside of the cryptospace (another hard-sell to non-bitcoin users), less developers are interested in smaller cryptos.
@_date: 2016-08-23 16:31:26
Low volume periods will not exist in a future zero-sum blockspace environment (fee market) when there are more who want to settle than can settle within each block. It's not nighttime everywhere in the world at the same time.
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:07:32
I love how this fluff twitter post shows up for people to trust Peter Todd again after people realized he wants to centrally plan (to delay) the next halving and increase the 21 million Bitcoin cap. Two things that should NEVER happen.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:34:56
Bitcoin can't go mainstream right now because blocks are full and that means it can't accept new users.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:39:05
Yup. Spot on.
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:47:50
Well, to be fair to myself, I was really asking a question about others opinions rather than commenting. 
I also have technical expertise in theorizing so it would be okay if I did that anyhow.. ;) Outside opinions aren't a problem - that's what I'm going for. More perspectives.
@_date: 2016-04-29 02:55:59
Yea, I suppose as a software engineer I'm not a "normal" user, but that was a requirement for me to understand and see how it was working.
Follow up question: Doesn't pushing users to Coinbase, Gemini, et. al also compromise decentralization? 
It seems like if less people are running/using nodes and using exchanges instead, that hurts the network.
Oh I also meant what if everyone tries to use a $0.04 fee - but the 1mb limit is reached. Some who pay a high fee will have to wait longer and longer..
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:16:49
Gavin continues to contribute non-controversial improvements to the protocol. Look at his commits on Github before you say he hasn't done anything recently.
One reason he created Classic is because it's a good idea to have an immediate fallback if the entire network shuts down due to congestion. If miners need to switch in a hurry to get the network working again they would have an option instead of waiting a month for Core to patch a new max-blocksize. 
It's a fallback option at the very least. If something goes wrong with Core's Roadmap, which some think is very dangerous, you'll be glad that Classic exists as something that only* changes things to 2mb and adopts Segwit and other additions down-stream from core.
This is how programming works, you create fallback systems, alternative systems that might be better in a healthy ecosystem of options. This makes the system richer on the whole, even if your opinions and politics disagree with it.
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:44:18
The fact that Gavin is a classy guy, nice to everyone and one of the best developers Bitcoin has ever had was censored here because Theymos disagreed with his scaling approach.
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:52:51
I was referring to a single input/output. Where one person tells a friend about Bitcoin and the friend sends BTC on-chain so they can see the transaction for themselves and learn about it. E.g., localbitcoins

Exactly, who wants a chain that millions of users can use without going through a massive company? NOBODY! ! !
hahaha.. oh wait
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:38:14
My question was a theoretical one about the future, when every block is full, including off-peak times when the mempool usually goes back to normal.
I'm definitely sure that at the moment you can send a transaction without waiting long by providing a sufficient and accurate fee. I'm thinking two months from now what the user experience might be like for new users who want to use on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:10:52
Consensus with the goal of being resistant to mob psychology doesn't mean we should be at the mercy of a radical and incorrect 5-10% of people who disagree with the direction of the majority. 5-10% of a group can easily be bought off/persuaded of anything by any government looking to kill the system.
For example, say China decides to take control of all Chinese mining pools and control what happens there. Do you think they will have consensus in protocol changes that would remove their newfound power? Nope.
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:13:06
Yep has to do with the max-blocksize (and the urgent need to raise it).

@_date: 2016-04-23 02:47:19
I didn't say currently, although at peak transaction times blocks have been completely full and people have waited several hours to get even a single confirmation, even when using the suggested fee.
However, if we scale by millions of users, imagine those additional users telling five of their friends about Bitcoin and trying to send each of them $10 of Bitcoin, as we've all done before. Three or even six transactions per second isn't going to cut it.
Also keep in mind we won't have a working Lightning network wallet until 2018 (best case scenario if they find a decentralized* way to build it). The soft fork optimizations of Segregated Witness won't be working in practice for another 4-6 months.
Just saying, if mass adoption happens right now Bitcoin will fall flat on its face because Bitcoin Core chose not to increase the max-blocksize limit. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 23:36:50

I think the dude means that IRS has Bitcoin Blockchain exploring software that once they pair a wallet with a U.S. citizen, they will be able to calculate how much they owe based upon the price when they received the BTC and the price when they sent the BTC. Not software within Bitcoin - software running "on" the blockchain.

This was on this sub earlier this year. I'm too lazy to find it for you but it's there if you look. It wasn't censored or covered up and it's definitely not FUD. I'm pretty sure Peter Todd would confirm this for you if you asked him. He really things we should delay the halving.
please prove me wrong (and I will delete this and not post it anymore)
Do you believe we should delay the halving, or centrally control future block reward drops?
Second, do you think we should raise the 21 million coin limit?
Please reply no to both of these, if so I'll shut my loud mouth. ;P

Many computer scientists and the larger majority of Bitcoin developers disagree with the core approach that minimizes Bitcoin into a settlement layer. If they continue to disregard wisdom from the majority, you're going to end up with the Space Shuttle Columbia.

Also, see this recent post: [The Bitcoin block size debate is not just about technical expertise](
@_date: 2016-01-30 16:04:24
Can confirm, SW is a great idea.
The issue was that the core developers were touting the "80,000 new lines of code" to show the work they've put in. The effort here is excellent, but a lot of us thought there could be some [code smell]( involved with such a large addition if it were rushed out the door just to quell the larger block size need. 
Some think it makes more sense to just change the 1MB constant to 2MB, giving more time to roll out other changes slowly and carefully (yes, it has been tested, but who knows).
We're all for SW and LN, we just want an all options used approach taken.

For posterity, MIT stepped in to prevent the system from collapsing after the Bitcoin Foundation could no longer pay developers.

Exactly. This entire thing has failed if someone says, "Oh, fees are kinda low, let's fix that".
The main benefit of Bitcoin is on-chain inexpensive transactions. If that utility is removed, we're left with a shared settlement network that greatly limits what Bitcoin can become.

It's absolutely true, no laughing required.
@_date: 2016-01-19 04:34:27
I respectfully **completely disagree** with what Valery wrote. It's really sad to see this kind of propaganda going on - but whoever reads this needs to understand that what he wrote is wrong.
First, understand this: To get new users over the past three to four years, Bitcoin has sold the idea that it would allow **users to send money anywhere, quickly and free. Period.** That was the revolutionary idea. Bitcoin is valuable because of its transaction utility. None of this "oh we have to take your money now" approach.
This promise was floated freely in several years ago. However, Valery's vision is new, different and miner-centric. It breaks this original promise. In effect he's saying, "Welp, it no longer does that, so let's take that part off the website. It's still good *enough*."
Valery is essentially saying that the block reward isn't enough to keep miners mining, when the system is designed to become easier to mine when there are less miners around.
The idea that miners have to make additional money off of transaction fees in order to have *enough* incentive to continue mining... It's basically not trusting the system to work as designed. In that case why do we even have a block reward? In this scenario, miners are no different than any credit card payment processor, taking money off of the top.
This idea that a fee is necessary is totally wrong, and here's why:
**If you take away the basic fundamental user incentive to use the system, you undermine the value of that system.**
If Bitcoin is free to use, more people will use it. If more people use it the value goes up. That increased value then provides the only necessary incentive to mine Bitcoin. If the price goes down, less miners will be mining and discovering new blocks becomes easier. This is how the system should work.
Bitcoin isn't for miners or Nasdaq settlements. Bitcoin's primary function is for the basic user. Everyone can be their own bank. Anyone can send money to anyone, for free.
All transactions on the network should work in a timely manner and 10,000 unconfirmed transactions is unacceptable. The block size needs an increase, or the cap removed to allow new users to join, regardless of what China's internet speed is capped out at.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:43:21
1MB -&gt; 2MB change + SW would release that tense political climate and get people working together again. 
The question is why you insist on being so strict to the current max blocksize, originally intended to prevent spam. You could relieve that tension, get people working together again and stop dividing the community by making that one simple concession - but for some reason you won't. Seems odd.

@_date: 2016-06-06 23:46:53
A few points:
1) Keeping Bitcoins on a server or computer's hotwallet is dangerous. Even using a Trezor puts all of those funds on that one device - kinda scary if you're dealing with a lot of money.
2) Coinbase is a controversial company due to their larger-block position and people will express distaste for them here because of that.
3) Coinbase has a very secure cold-storage solution which is shared with their wallet/exchange. Both wallets and exchanges need this.
4) Coinbase does not want to be a hot wallet, where users are using funds daily to purchase goods. This is partially because they run into issues where on-chain transactions get held up due to full blocks and users go to them asking why the transaction hasn't gone though - thus explains the large-block intentions to get funds moving faster.
5) If you're a newbie you're many many times more likely to mess something up on your own than just using an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini.
6) Both Coinbase and Gemini are regulated, but both have insurance in case of financial loss if one of them gets hacked and your coins disappear.

This is logically inconsistent. Not everyone can have a 'high enough' fee to get into the next block. We're at the point that even users who have included large fees are getting very long confirmation times. That means the network becomes unreliable. Not a very good quality to have right now.
Miners should be incentivized by the exchange rate to dollars and other currencies (which they use as a benchmark) and not by pushing up txn costs at the expense of users. The past few months of growth is evidence that the exchange rate and belief that a shrinking inflation supply is going to make their coins more valuable. A high fee market is not needed for many many years - maybe decades.

Those nodes were ras-pi mining rigs that went away as the hash rate increased. If a single person has 30 nodes that's not exactly legitimately decentralized either.
That's not proving my hypothesis wrong, because it makes complete sense that at least some new people getting into Bitcoin would setup a new node.
Sure, some will use online wallets, but if you have 50 million new users, you will have many many times the current node count.

I think Bitcoin's current economic situation has more to do with the halving than Brexit. Bitcoin isn't mainstream enough yet to be pushed too much by general markets, and most hodl'ers have limited positions in those markets anyway.
One area it could be affected by are emerging market capitol outflow that we've seen a lot of over the past year. This usually happens before a general market recession as smarter investors try to move into safer positions. This is a stronger influence than Brexit right now, even if people on CNBC try to explain it another way.
In the longer term, 3-5 years, a market recession is actually good for Bitcoin going mainstream because it shows people the corruption and ineffeciencies in the current global financial system (as austerity measures are used to prop up markets after a crash).
Just my two-cents.

High fees are actually never required unless the exchange rate doesn't increase.
The thing about Bitcoin is that it's based on sound economic principals. As inflation slows and the maximum coin limit nears (~130 years out) each coin becomes more rare and this more valuable. People know this and become willing to pay more for one due to the increasing rarity.
Think about it - several halvings from now the reward will only be 3 full Bitcoins, but this is many many years away and by that time the exchange rate might be $40,000 per Bitcoin, or more. When that happens we will be dealing with mBTCs and uBTCs, smaller divisions of a single Bitcoin.
If you chart this out we won't need to introduce fees for a very long time. When the halvings end, small transaction fees with large volume will cover the mining expenses to secure the network and considering mass adoption you will have millions of users participating in the 'network maintenance'.
Also see Bitcoin FAQ:
"Bitcoins are created at a decreasing and predictable rate. The number of new bitcoins created each year is automatically halved over time until bitcoin issuance halts completely with a total of 21 million bitcoins in existence. At this point, Bitcoin miners will probably be supported exclusively by numerous small transaction fees."
High fees also deter Bitcoin from scaling by making Bitcoin a less attractive alternative to the status-quo. You don't want to strangle a growing technology before it's gotten off of the ground.
@_date: 2016-06-29 21:39:38
If everyone used a wallet with the best fee estimation, users would still have their transactions kicked off, because there is not enough space for new, or even current user levels.
That's not fixable by increasing a fee.

It's unfortunate, but this has been their plan all along. Some of us recognized that.
Promise, delay, promise, delay... delay indefinitely, while they work on the code THEY want to work on.
Whatever these Core developers say, it's clear that they are interested in their own vision and not the communities vision for Bitcoin. They also claim that anything other than their vision isn't Bitcoin.
Bitcoin used to be an open-source project, but it sure doesn't look like it these days.
@_date: 2016-06-14 20:36:27
When I see videos like this my gut tells me something is wrong here. 
It makes me feel that Bitcoin is not as decentralized as we would like to think, and that a few large miners and mining pools have control over the accepted protocol. The monetary barrier to entry into mining is also a problem. 
I don't have a solution for it. Does anyone else also get that feeling?

What if someone buys something and the transaction doesn't process. Do they need to go back to the store to agree to a greater price that covers the new higher fee? It doesn't work from the buyers or sellers perspective. RBF is also controversial and shouldn't exist as part of the protocol.

Many people have ignored the important fact that when more users can use on-chain transactions, node counts and decentralization will increase. This is great for Bitcoin. 
That won't happen until the max-blocksize is increased. People aren't interested in paying a small fee through a 2nd-layer middle-man solution. There is nothing novel about that. People can use Visa or their bank if they want a middle-man. Off-chain is not the way to scale.
Hardware and internet connection speeds may be an issue for a ras-pi + 56k dial-up nodes - which will drop off eventually anyway - but holding the network back for those rigs is unwise.

Sure, but 1MB every 10 minutes? That's not conservative, it's unnecessarily constrained.
The analogy to a one-lane highway causing congestion in the podcast is a good one. I agree that there is a blocksize limit that we shouldn't cross but it's many MB higher than the current cap. A cap that was always meant to be increased at this moment in time.

Instead of being angry at Circle you should be angry at Core for not increasing the maximum blocksize. Fees are hard to predict during 'fee events' and not everyone can fit on the network even if everyone uses a high fee.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:15:25
Stable in the sense that users have to guess some high fee in order to get transactions in a block is unacceptable.
Slow and unreliable is not just fine.
@_date: 2016-02-23 03:26:45
I disagree with anyone trying to increase the cost of an open source protocol just because they "think" a fee market should exist. Total rubbish.
If you want miners to have more income, increase the on-chain transactions and they will get twice as many fees. Pretty simple, and IBLT solutions can take away any block transmission time issues.
Further, if off-chain solutions are the main way Bitcoin scales, that will be a massive long-term income loss to miners and will make the entire network less secure (less miners, making less).
It's hard for Blockstream to see Bitcoin scaling without their LN solution at the center. They bought out the core devs and by doing so purchased an open-source protocol that millions were using. 
Also, Bitcoin Core developers are acting like Bitcoin is a closed-source protocol: closed-door meetings in Hong Kong, legal threats, etc.. and the most obvious of all, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream 'representing' Bitcoin Core developers.. Really? 
They're ruining a 6bn dollar open-source protocol that has had so much promise up until now..
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:52:11
Note: The lightning network, if it works as proposed, will scale transactions and generally only small transactions. It won't scale users.
Bitcoin's user numbers are limited by the on-chain max blocksize. Keep this in mind.
LN is a cool idea and one of many much needed solutions, but don't get confused that it will allow 30-100 million new users onboard to Bitcoin.

That's what Mods are for - making this a safe place to express ideas. Unfortunately they haven't been doing their job in this sub. They've let a serious form of hate brew because they think it will push their agenda forward. Instead, it's split this community in two.
Post something about classic or positive about increasing the blocksize === insta-ban.
Post unfounded defamations about someone that the mods disagree with: Gavin Andresen or Craig Wright, they will let you and your post stay.
Meanwhile, Jon Matonis who apparently represents Blockstream also posted on his blog that he thinks Craig Wright is Satoshi - that hasn't gotten any coverage on this sub.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:49:28
I'm talking about probability: the chance that something is true or false.
It would be difficult to convince Gavin Andresen, someone who corresponded with Satoshi for years and Craig Wright did convince him in person by making the signature in-person with Satoshi's private key from a flash drive. 
Just because that signature exists elsewhere doesn't matter as long as he had the key to make it work in the presence of others, which is purportedly what happened.
That doesn't give me, you or other reddit users absolute proof yet. It does, however, give it a higher likelihood than not (in terms of probability) that he is genuinely Satoshi.

We should do Segwit, LN, signature optimizations and also scale on-chain at the same time (by increasing the cap with one of the dynamic scaling algorithms based on network growth). 
Bitcoin's growth has been stifled by full blocks over the past six months. The tentative price growth reflects the hesitation by businesses and new users. Businesses have been vocal about this and the majority have expressed that they support on-chain scaling while Bitcoin is still small.
An all-approach is better than just one approach. Hopefully we can get past the politics on the matter and make Bitcoin available to more users on-chain.

Also, I have no skin in the game, I couldn't care less whether it's him or not, although I would feel bad for Gavin for getting duped if it were the case that someone hacked the public wifi they were using to download a tampered electrum wallet, etc., which Gavin said was highly unlikely. It's also highly unlikely that Gavin would risk his career and influence in the community on something like this unless he was completely sure. Even gavin said his public evidence was junk evidence and there is a disconnect between what he experienced and what CW put forward on his blog.

They way you're trying to minimize Gavin's role in Bitcoin shows how sensitive you are about it.

Actually the worst thing for Bitcoin has been the immaturity of this sub-reddit. He hasn't put a bad face on anything.
At a basic level human beings deserve respect both in person and online. If he has a mental issue that requires professional help we should have compassion for him. If he's Bitcoin's creator, although eccentric, we should have respect and be grateful for what he started.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:24:33
His post is incorrect, it shows poor judgement. Before this post, I thought Wladimir was very fit to lead. That is no longer a belief I or anyone else should hold.
This post is incorrect because it paints Gavin Andresen as someone who has encouraged anger, etc. Gavin has never done that- in fact the opposite, has tried to calm the noise around the debate, telling people to stop the name calling and stop the shouting. He was one of the few people calling for a civilized and kind debate about the scaling issue. He asked for the FUD on both sides to stop multiple times, in public and on podcasts.
Second, it's convenient that Wladimir is now the only person with admin privileges. This makes him essentially a dictator.
Last they're trying to consolidate the name from Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin. This is a name-grab that they are unjustified in doing. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, open-source software. It needs multiple wallet implementations to make it's development decentralized to make it stronger, less prone to attack. E.g., if a rich country or nefarious company wants to hurt Bitcoin and buy off 5 developers at the top, they can do that more easily if there is just one wallet implementation. One wallet, one software is bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-02 18:56:06

Any reasonable user without an agenda would believe that the definition of "altcoin" would be a cryptocurrency that has it's own blockchain completely separate from Bitcoin. E.g., Litecoin, VIAcoin, etc. Different ledgers.
What you've described as your policy is that: any post positive mention of Bitcoin wallet software other the wallet that moderators prefer is deleted.
The other wallet softwares currently occupy ~30 percent of current operating Bitcoin nodes, supporting and decentralizing the network.
With all due respect, how is that not censorship?
I am sincerely grateful you've been willing to discuss this and you've been super nice, and my intention is that this policy can be reviewed by you and the other moderators (when you get together to chat about things).
@_date: 2016-05-04 04:47:41
Your conclusions follow from your arguments, but the history needs adding to and then some cause for alarm which I hope you might dwell on for a bit. :)
The only issue I would take is that unanimous consensus was not always required. Four years ago when Gavin was leading things if there was a disagreement about a merge/commit, as lead dev he would make the decision on what would happen. Small fish back then.
Having that power didn't sit well with him, and he didn't want to take the BDFL role even as some nudged and suggested he was qualified to. When he gave the reigns to Wladimir, who was also understandably weary of that position of power, Wladimir introduced the idea of unanimous consensus for controversial additions, shying away from the idea that admin privileges gave him any sort of power.
At this point, and only at this point, it then became possible that any one member could disagree about a change and make it non-unanimous. It created the monopoly/centralization/control over the rules that define what Bitcoin "is" and has allowed some to steer it in the direction that they choose without listening to part of the community.
The centralization of development is Bitcoin's biggest "white elephant in the room" flaw with software that is supposed to be open-source and decentralized. I think it's also a clear conflict of interest for the Bitcoin Core developers to want to be the one and only Bitcoin development team. Naturally - as it gives more importance to them and companies will pay them more because they could have access to influence.
Conclusion: It would be wise to allow a widening of the discussion here to include Bitcoin-compatible wallet software, recognizing that the newly added unanimous consensus rules are overly burdensome on a free, open and "decentralized" discussion. 
I'm imagining a future where this sub is similar to a working-group arrangement. In the end, miners decide which code is "Bitcoin" anyway, not just a few software developers. Do you see a future that allows for a more open discussion than just what is allowed by Core developers?
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:12:58

@_date: 2016-05-03 16:56:30
My hope is that when the proof comes out for one way or the other there will be a lesson on this sub to be more kind to people.
Some vocal people in here have been downright nasty both to Craig Wright and Gavin Andresen (Jon Matonis and Ian Gregg have been mostly ignored). There is no excuse for that sort of conduct. You should really all be ashamed of yourselves for acting like children for the past 24 - 48 hours.
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:07:27
It was more of a logical path following, my tone of voice was more inquisitive and curious ;)
I'm just saying, I think it would be healthy for the community if multiple Bitcoin wallet softwares could be talked about, weighted pros/cons could be discussed here. Bitcoin is always changing and having that discussion in the open and transparent in one place, hopefully this place, would be positive and heal the community.

If his goal was to prove that evidence on the Blockchain is the only real source of verification -- for anything -- he's really been quite successful at that.
Think about it, anyone can steal your identity, credit cards, whatever and impersonate you just by knowing a few easy-to-get things. But the blockchain guarantees you are who you say you are, and have control of the funds you claim to have control of. Nobody else can steal that if Bitcoin is used to underwrite your identity.
In a way, it's great for Bitcoin that this whole charade has happened.
There are millions in the world who can't get bank accounts because they don't have birth certificates, etc. Bitcoin lets them have a place to store value and thus have an economic identity. I think this is one of Bitcoin's best applications.

There's nothing "free" about confirming low-fee transactions because the very act of downloading, confirming and storing other user transactions is also the process that gives **your own** current BTC investments value and validity. Peer-to-peer has value because it's what we collectively agree upon as being true. Supporting that process is a self-reinforcing act.

You can have both on-chain scaling and peer-to-peer. Something in your mind has persuaded you otherwise, but lucky for everyone else in this ecosystem, you're wrong on a technical level.
Additionally, your idea of scaling might be 100MB or 300MB, but most people want modest on-chain increases of two to eight MB that would last the next ten years. Adding Segwit to that would increase scaling further. It's a smarter path.
Just to mention this again: off-chain scaling that requires a trusted 3rd party defeats the purpose of using Bitcoin in the first place. Store of value is only valuable if the on-chain network can process all of that value. in economic terms, limiting the velocity of exchange is a very bad idea. It also stifles growth, pushes new users onto other on-chain coins. This has happened over the past 6 months, it's not a future thing. Off-chain scaling promotes Bitcoin's destruction.

No, I would say my comment was expressing cautiousness. I'm not the conspiracy theorist type. I go on facts and Blockstream has done some really bad things in the past year:
1) Adam Back going to China, promise Chinese miners that a hard-fork to 2MB would happen.
2) Reneged on this agreement at the disdain of the entire Bitcoin community.

I'm sure you're a smart person but you should really consider that in this case you might be completely wrong.
I consider "Bitcoin" to be the original intent of the Bitcoin whitepaper. The original intent was not to have trusted 3rd party scaling, it was meant as a solution to 3rd party facilitated payments. Bitcoin was first and foremost designed to be a peer-to-peer payment network.

You're jumping from 50 million users as the author of the post suggested as a test case to 8-10 billion for every transaction everywhere. That is taking things to the extreme, which I often see small-blockers do because their arguments don't make sense against modest on-chain scaling.
On-chain scaling solutions provide the ability for Bitcoin to continue growing in users while allowing time for other more advancements to be developed.
Also, Bitcoin **can scale on-chain** with XThin, IBLTs (head-first mining) and modest max-block size increases. 
Last, countries will always have fiat or their own chains, Bitcoin is going to be a Global commerce peer-to-peer electronic cash system. 
I stick by my statement that off-chain transactions are not verifiable and thus not Bitcoin. Off-chain scaling also pushes users to use 3rd parties to facilitate transactions, which is what the Bitcoin Whitepaper cites as the main reason for Bitcoin existing:
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution."
and 
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."

It's not the right scaling solution no matter who is developing it. It's a 2nd-layer middleman. Think about it - give it 5 minutes and you'll realize that.

The Bitcoin whitepaper lays out the decentralized trust-less framework for what Bitcoin "is".

Yup, even the richest person in China or any other dictatorship are powerless - because they have no rights. Without rights you can never actually have true wealth because there is no justice built into the system. Bitcoin changes that.

there is a large distance between 1MB (current) and 8 GB. Pretty extreme example.
8MB on the other hand, would be just fine with XThin blocks and IBLTs. That would scale Bitcoin modestly and any hardware/storage upgrades would still be attainable by the average user.
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:07:29
Actually, I do. In order to scale it requires a central hubs to lock many transactions and then settle them. That's a middleman.
@_date: 2016-07-17 23:42:46
You guys might as well have said, "How can we prevent miners from ditching the Core scaling roadmap".
The fact that core developers are talking about changing the POW, putting millions of miner investments in jeopardy, is just another example of why the current core developers can't be trusted.
Their motto might as well be: Our way or no way

My gut says wolf in a sheep's clothing. I'm not a lawyer so I can't evaluate whether these patents might be used if Blockstream gets angry after a possible hard-fork.

Bitcoin is actually well suited to moving large amounts rather than small amounts.
Right now if you move a small amount your fee is likely to be a high percentage of the funds you're moving.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:21:53
Obviously what you're saying is not true because Peter R and other Bitcoin Classic/XT developers are some of the best around (probably *the* best). It's clear that Satoshi noticed this and that's why he handed control of the project off to Gavin Andresen. Gavin found BitcoinCore toxic, as other developers have, and forked to make sure the original intentions of Satoshi were implemented.
Bitcoin core egos don't allow them to make room for other developers. This isn't my opinion, it's every great developer's opinion in the space. That's one reason why people want to leave the current restrictive core devs behind (except for those that want to collaborate again).

Yea, the BIP109 ACKs were by far in the majority. Something like 85%-90%.

The Bitcoin Whitepaper:
"Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. "
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model."
That means that any scaling shouldn't be forced to go through a "trusted" middleman. Blockstream wants to be the ultimate middleman for Bitcoin with their 2nd-layer Lightning network.

It's a good thing storage is getting cheaper/faster, hardware is getting cheaper and network speeds are increasing each year. It follows Moore's Law.
Also, the  source of income for miners is the exchange rate to other currencies, which has been increasing on a log scale. Even 10 or 20 years from now if that pace continues the network will become more and more profitable for miners without high fees. In fact, low fees attract new users and make the network more valuable.

@_date: 2016-07-18 04:52:25


No, I'm not. They only started this talk after miners started talking about switching the codebase. It's a conflict of interest. They want to keep control and power over development so they are talking about how they can scare miners into running their code. They've done it before in the past 6 months the last time Classic became popular.
Also, they shouldn't be central planning a POW change. Core devs are always concerned about the fears of people losing money as a reason for not hard-forking but they don't seem to care about people who have invested into mining equipment.
For the record, I'm not a miner and I think centralized mining *is* a problem. Changing the POW is the wrong solution.
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:15:24
pb1x said "Bitcoin can be used for payments without the Blockchain"..
wut. That's crazy talk
I don't think he knows what Bitcoin is. Only on-chain transactions are legitimate. If it doesn't happen on-chain, it's not Bitcoin. If it's not on the Bitcoin Blockchain, it didn't happen because nobody on the other side of the earth can verify that it did actually happen.
The settlement network is a very bad idea. I don't think pb1x has the economic educational credentials to comment on economic theory either.

Your analogy doesn't hold because there is no place for ISIS-extremism supporting articles in the first place.
The reason that allowing ETH articles, good or bad, is a double standard is because it's up to each individual mod to determine what their feeling is about any given article before it's banned. It's a relative judgement (people interpret things differently).

Bitcoin Core doesn't get new developers because the space is toxic and unwelcoming. I imagine that many good, smart developers have spent long and thoughtful hours on new additions and they never see the light of day because a few people at the top haven't paid attention or disagree politically.
Luckily, Bitcoin Classic exists which is more welcoming to developers.

It's not you're fault, it's the developers' faults who have decided to make it a hard time on you by not increasing the max blocksize to 1MB.
In a high-volume period with perfectly calculated fees some users transactions will still not go through - because they are at capacity.
If there are repeated traffic jams on a highway, cities usually build new lanes. This is Bitcoin's most urgent issue.
@_date: 2016-07-18 19:44:37
When Bitcoin succeeds because of Bitcoin Classic or another alternative implementation I'm sure you'll wrongly take credit for it's success. Bitcoin was meant to scale on-chain.
@_date: 2016-07-30 16:01:27
Oh, correct - I misread the BIP. You're right on the number.
Either way, neither was ever a "hostile" hard fork, as you described, because Classic only activates with a 75% consensus, when people overwhelmingly support it. This is much higher than the "Nakamoto consensus" of 51%, which would be considered hostile.
Meanwhile, there has and does exist the fear from Core Developers that they would lose their precious positions as the main developers of Bitcoin.
This subreddit should be a forum for all ideas, including pro-XT and pro-Classic even if they threaten those in centralized positions of power.
This debate is about the blocksize but it is also about removing centralized power. Centralized obstructive policies have created unnecessary high fees that have boosted alt-coin adoption while preventing new users from joining Bitcoin.
