@_date: 2014-09-02 13:30:44
Cheers, thanks for the list.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:42:15
phew, we thought it was us...
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:55:07
Members are not able to buy Bitcoin directly with funds from credit cards. Chargebacks are one of a few reasons for this restriction. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:00:38
We bring you the best rate from our Bitcoin exchange partners. It is updated in real-time. 
For compliance reasons, the withdrawal must still be reviewed so it takes 1-3 days to process. However, your exchange rate is locked in at the moment your withdrawal is created.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:53:04
Hi u/killjoy1X, I'll try to answer as much as possible. Let's start with the US. Payza uses an agent in the US to grant us licensing. Our former partner ran into problems leaving us without a legal way to transmit money. As of the beginning of July we obtained licensing to operate in the US so full service has been restored.
AlertPay was indeed purchased in 2012 and the platform was re-branded as Payza. Many members of the original executive team, including the founders, remain with the company today. 
For checkout payments, a member can verify their credentials on the checkout page as they complete payment. Guest checkout is not available, but non-members can now create an account and pay by credit card right from your checkout page. We just launched that option, you can read more about it [on our blog](
Payza is available to businesses in most countries, with a few exceptions [found here]( 
For business verification you will need to provide business documents to prove ownership, [examples are here]( and you will also need to go through personal verification. This process varies by country, US has an instant verification method, as does the UK, but most countries follow [the procedure found here](
Hope that helps...also, Reddit really needs a preview option.
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:46:47
I'm sorry I didn't realize that was the case. I know that for compliance reasons you would not be able to complete a Bitcoin transaction without a verified account, but I did not realize our system blocked you from these pages as well. I will speak with our team to see if it is possible to at least unblock these pages so you can view the current rates.
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:49:04
...so does this mean Payza would have your support if we get Bitcoin integration right? 
edit: spelling
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:13:44
For now you won't be able to use money deposited to your account by credit card for a Bitcoin Withdrawal because of the fraud risks. Unfortunately that includes Visa debit cards, even though they are connected to a bank account.
In most cases, Bank Transfers, Bank Wires, and Interac (for Canada) deposits will all work with Bitcoin withdrawals, and so will funds sent to you by other Payza members.
The Interac option is instant, which is great for Canadian members. We're looking for ways to offer similar deposit methods in more countries.
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:12:12
No love for Payza bringing a Bitcoin buying option to our members in over 190 countries? we're a little hurt.
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:53:42
We do not have a ticker at this time that displays our buy/sell prices, but that is a good idea, I will suggest it to our team.
Currently the exchange rate is displayed in real-time when you are on Payza's Bitcoin Deposit or Withdrawal page. You would need an account to access these pages. The good news is, a Payza account is free to set up and carries no monthly or yearly fees so there's no risk to try.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:51:26
That's understandable. Those funds are still on record here and we are working to resolve the issue and help you get that money back. We can't rewrite history but we can work to earn back your trust.
@_date: 2014-10-24 18:33:25
1) yes
2) yes, but because of the chargeback/fraud risk, we do not currently allow funds added by credit card to be used for purchasing Bitcoin
3) the rate is a blended rate from the market and our liquidity partners. Our aim is to be as transparent as possible in terms of fees and exchange rates. At last check we were buying BTC at 347.9686 USD, and selling at 362.11 USD
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:35:20
We have over 10 million accounts from Albania to Zambia and just about everywhere in between. We're not quite as big as some of the other players in this space but we do have one of the largest global footprints and we're growing every day.
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:37:34
They would still be paid in fiat currency but they will have the option to withdraw those funds from Payza by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:11:17
We're certainly planning to build on this first step. We expect Bitcoin to be an important part of the online payment ecosystem sooner rather than later and we want to be part of that growth.
That said, there are a lot of issue to navigate in terms of full-scale Bitcoin adoption on the Payza platform. The main issue is that we need to ensure both Buyers and Sellers will be protected before we can offer Bitcoin payments through Payza. That means there needs to be some form of payment reversibility or escrow, otherwise Buyers would need to sign off on a no refund policy.
We love the idea of letting people keep bitcoins in their Payza e-wallets, but since the ewallets are online, we need to be absolutely certain that the bitcoins will be protected.
I can say that Bitcoin integration is one of our main focuses right now at Payza, so expect more options soon!
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:34:31
The 2% fee is the only charge we take, after that you get your bitcoins at our wholesale exchange rate. The wholesaler applies the spread to take their cut.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:33:36
Currently we only support traditional bank transfers in the UK. 
We are always looking for ways to provide the fastest, most secure deposit and withdrawal options at the lowest cost, so hopefully this is something we'll be able to bring you soon.
edit/update: Had a chance to speak with our team that would implement this type of feature, currently it is not something offered by our provider but they are actively working to incorporate the feature, so it should come to our system sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:42:21
Good to know, thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:38:37
For some reason, eBay hasn't shown an interest in using us. I guess they're happy with *their processor of choice.
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:01:47


For some transactions verification is required, but it is not absolutely necessary in order to use Payza. Generally when you are depositing or withdrawing funds verification is required. This can also vary by country, as different countries have different regulations.
Additional verification is rare but can be necessary in some cases in order for us to meet our regulatory requirements. If, for whatever reason, a member cannot fulfill these requirements funds will usually be returned to their source, similar to what would happen if you could not complete standard verification. 
Of course, if the source is a Bticoin sale, then this becomes more difficult, however, our Customer Support Team will work with you to ensure that you have a way to withdraw your balance.
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:24:36
Our first tip, very cool! Thanks PrimeDice
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:31:44
Haha, yes that is a bit awkward isn't it. Thanks for pointing it out, look for a change this week.
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:25:00
Right now we only support Bitcoin Withdrawals but there are plans to expand on that. Keep an eye out for future updates.
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:26:38
Right now you can only view the exchange rate on the Bitcoin Withdrawal Page. That means you need to be logged in to your account.
At 12:25 pm EST I see our exchange at 1 Bitcoin = 595.00 USD while Google lists the price at 1 Bitcoin = 589.06. That gives a spread of 1%, and there is also a 2% fee from Payza, so the total spread comes to approximately 3%
@_date: 2014-08-11 18:39:02
Obopay is no longer operational. We lost our US licensing when they went out of business and were briefly forced to cease US operations. We are now once again licensed and fully operational in the Us.
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:31:30
We've already updated our Withdrawal options and FAQ section, and we'll have a blog post with more information coming on Monday. For now, take a look at our [Bitcoin Withdrawal FAQ section]( for more info, or just send us a PM. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:44:53
We are confident the current situation in the US will be resolved favorably for our members, and aside from this isolated incident, members in over 190 countries have been using Payza for more than 2 years now without issue. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:21:56
Ha, love the suggestion. Right now Bitcoin is still not supported in the Payza e-wallet so it doesn't quite qualify just yet. Hopefully we'll be able to add it to the list soon as we expand our Bitcoin features.
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:10:42
Since we opened up Bitcoin Withdrawals on our platform we've seen people from India, Pakistan, Algeria, Bulgaria, Nigeria, The Philippines, Croatia, Qatar, Palestine, Israel, Jamaica, Morocco and dozens of other countries take advantage. ([shameless plug](
Making it easier to buy isn't the only thing people in developing countries need, but it's definitely a start. Education and infrastructure are also important, but the desire to learn about and take advantage of Bitcoin seems to be there even in developing markets. This is a very exciting movement to be a part of.
Edit: Just spotted Bitcoin purchased in the UAE as well, so OP there are people in your country buying BTC using Payza.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:09:33
It is important to note that we are not a Bitcoin exchange, Payza is first and foremost an e-wallet service and online payment platform. We have a dedicated and innovative team that's always looking for new ways to add value for our members, which is part of the reason we were able to be one of the first (if not the first) in our space to offer Bitcoin services. 
A 2% fee may seem high when compared to other exchangers, however by making it simple for our members in over 190 countries to acquire Bitcoin we feel we are providing a fair service for the fee. For many of our members, buying and selling through Payza is the simplest, least confusing option, making the 2% fee somewhat negligible. For the majority of our members this is the first time they are encountering Bitcoin, and a straightforward, easy-to-understand method to buy and sell Bitcoin is well worth the fee involved.
We are also trying to be as transparent as possible when it comes to our fees. So rather than blending this fee into the exchange rate, we disclose it outright.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:57:23
That's interesting, I'll make sure our team looks into that if they aren't already.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:36:39
I wouldn't know myself, but our developers would. They've been exploring the different options, I'll make sure they know about this to see if that work.
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:32:54
This is the direction we're most interested in at the moment. If regulations and partnerships allow it, we want our members to be able to buy and sell Bitcoins within their Payza ewallets, and we want our merchants to have the option to accept Bitcoin payments as they would with any other currency we support.
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:10:42
20$ is the Bank Wire deposit fee. Many European countries as well as Canada and the US have access to Bank Transfer deposits which are significantly less expensive (it's free in most cases). 
In other markets Payza is a popular remittance portal as well as a way for freelancers to receive money online, so often members are receiving funds as opposed to adding their own. Part of the benefit of adding a Bitcoin Withdrawal feature is that it gives members another low-cost withdrawal option.
@_date: 2014-08-11 21:01:44
We expect Bitcoin to play a major role in the Payza platform but we're not rushing into it. This is uncharted territory for us but we're incredibly excited about the opportunities Bitcoin presents. This blog post from May has more details about our vision for Payza and Bitcoin and can give you a bit of insight into the challenges we face: 
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:45:45
Hi Jackten, sorry for the inconvenience. We always suggest our members get verified as early as possible to avoid complications later on. These blog posts help explain the verification process:
U.S.: 
International: 
Let me know if you have other questions or if there's anything we can do to help.
Oh, and as a side note, if you cannot verify your identity through the methods above, you can contact our Customer Support Team and they can provide alternatives. If you do not wish to verify your identity, funds will usually be returned to their source after an internal investigation.
Edit: reading your story again I see that you did verify your account. Apologies again for the inconvenience, I'm not sure why you would be subject to additional verification. I will speak to our team to conduct a review. If you can send us a PM with either your Account ID (email address) or any ticket numbers related to this issue (if you submitted a ticket for this issue) that would certainly help.
@_date: 2014-08-08 16:31:44
I replied but I also downvoted just to cover my bases ;) But hey, have an upvote for this one
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:34:16
We're not as big yet as some of the other guys in our space, I can't see this good news causing any more than a 5% drop.
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:27:15
Essentially, this new service is a way to sell Bitcoin, to exchange BTC for USD. Payza does not yet hold Bitcoin on our members' behalf, but with this feature we now offer a way to both buy and sell bitcoins.
When you use the Bitcoin Deposit feature, you will be using your own Bitcoin to fund your Payza e-wallet with USD funds. By the same token, the Bitcoin Withdrawal feature lets you buy Bitcoin with the funds in your Payza account. Does that make sense?
Payza offers several other deposit and withdrawal options as well. So if you wanted to exchange BTC for Fiat using Payza's services and then withdraw those funds by Bank Transfer, Bank Wire or Credit Card that is possible as well (where available).
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:38:55
That's more or less right. See Charlie's answer for more details.
Edit: link to Charlie's answer: 
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:20:01
We're excited about it too! Thanks for your support

*unhodl* FTFY
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:23:06
Yes, this is correct. We're looking for ways to make purchasing Bitcoin with CC funds possible, but right now there is still too much risk and uncertainty.
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:13:53
It's definitely an idea that comes up here very often but we haven't found the right way to implement it. Thanks for letting us know you're interested, the more demand for this type of service that we see, the better the chances that we find a way to make a directory available.
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:41:40
Our full official comment and subsequent discussion on this situation can be found here on our interactive support forum:  
The tl;dr of it is: We are working with the US DOJ to ensure that our US members get their funds returned as quickly as possibly. These funds are still on record with Payza but they are not shown as part of the current balance since the funds are inaccessible until the situation is resolved.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:25:54
Actually in the U.S. that is part of the verification process, this is handled by a third-party provider. U.S. members have access to one of the fastest verification methods we provide, in many countries you need to submit a government ID and a proof of address, which is then manually verified by our team. We've been able to speed up that process as well, but it is nowhere near as fast as the near-instant verification that U.S. members enjoy.
For compliance reasons, your Payza account must be verified in order to use the Bitcoin Withdrawal feature.
@_date: 2014-08-12 13:05:01
This is to protect our members, the withdrawals still needs to be reviewed and approved in case of fraud etc.
It's important to note that the rate of exchange is locked in at the moment the withdrawal is created. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:59:09
We currently have roughly 10 million active accounts, including approximately 100,000 business accounts. We have made major inroads into developing and underdeveloped markets such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, although the U.S. continues to be our largest market. If you check our Alexa stats, you'll see Payza is around the top-500 websites in Bangladesh, and is high in Pakistan, Spain and Russia as well.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:13:07
Not at this time. The first phase of this release is allowing Payza Business Account members to accept payment by Bitcoin for their products and services, while being paid in fiat for their item. They would receive the exact same amount for their item whether paid by Bitcoin or by fiat.
We do plan on enabling an option where merchants can choose to keep some or all of their Bitcoin payments in bitcoins, but that would only come in a future iteration.
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:05:35
Unfortunately we do not keep a public directory of businesses that process with Payza, but we always suggest spreading the word if you find businesses that don't already use Payza as a processor.
Payza Business Accounts are free to open and there are no monthly/yearly fees. Integrating Payza Payment Buttons is relatively simple and we have an integration team on hand to help with troubleshooting. There are also many popular shopping carts that have an integrated Payza module, listed [here](
Payza has a referral program that lets you earn up to $10 for each qualifying referral, so we make it worth your while to help spread the word. You would of course need your own Payza account to take advantage. [More info on the referral program.](
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:58:38
I can say that Payza's Bitcoin products have gone through several iterations since it first launched and many improvements were aimed at keeping our exchange rates more stable and closer in line with major exchanges. Admittedly, dealing with Bitcoin Exchanges may be more cost effective in some cases, so we aim to make up the difference by adding value. 
We feel that buying and selling Bitcoin using Payza is much simpler than going through an exchange, and much less intimidating to people that aren't as savvy when it comes to understanding how Bitcoin works.
Our goal was to give our current member base a simple introduction to Bitcoin and to provide support for them along the way while offering a service that experienced Bitcoiners would also be interested in using.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:10:44
Thanks, and happy Cake Day!
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:52:55
Hi, thanks for your interest. As far as taxes go, you are responsible for dealing with your business's taxes, we would simply process payments for you, but our tools do make it easy for you to keep track of sales made through Payza. 
Using Payza to process for most adult content is allowed as per our user agreement, but there are obviously some restrictions. Also, because of the higher risk, there are generally higher fees involved. As you develop a processing history with Payza, these fees can be lowered.
For standard businesses, the receiving fees for payments (either by Bitcoin or by e-wallet) is 2.50%+$0.25, that's pretty competitive. Right now, all Bitcoin payments you receive through Payza would be credited to your Payza account in the fiat currency of your choice. You would then be able to withdraw those funds using one of our convenient withdrawal options. If you choose to withdraw by Bitcoin, the spread is 2% over our exchange rate, calculated in real time.
Eventually we plan on giving merchants the option to keep some or all of the Bitcoin payments they receive in Bitcoin, I don't know yet what the pricing for that would be, but it would probably be in line with the 2.50%+$0.25 receiving fee.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:39:02
Payza offers services in over 190 countries, our services are available in more countries than most other online payment processors.
Currently, Payza is only available as an online payment solution and remittance platform. You can use it to instantly send and receive money almost anywhere in the world, as well as to pay or accept payment when shopping online.
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:25:27
We sure think so ;)
We're especially happy to offer an easy way for people in developing economies to purchase Bitcoin. Payza offers services in over 190 countries and they certainly aren't all equal in terms of access to this type of service. Hopefully Payza can help bridge a rather large gap.
@_date: 2015-01-29 14:42:43
Payza is most certainly not EgoPay and/or Virtex. These companies provided exchanger services for Payza members. Since the recent issues with EgoPay, they have been removed as a Payza Authorized Exchanger.
You can still view the current list of Payza Authorized e-Currency Exchangers on this page: 
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:20:16
We outlined our vision for Bitcoin and Payza several months ago in this blog post:  . This vision is still very much intact, but in terms of implementing service, we are being somewhat cautious and deliberate in our approach.
The ability to buy and sell are lower risk for our company, when we start dealing with holding and transferring Bitcoin things get slightly more complicated.
Ultimately, Payza's goal is to have a full suite of Bitcoin services, including the ability for our members to hold Bitcoin, send/receive, and accept Bitcoin payments, but we are taking our time to do it in a way that will offer the greatest protection possible to all our members, whether they are individuals or merchants.
I can tell you that at Payza we are very excited about the world of possibilities that Bitcoin and other virtual currencies present, and that yesterday's announcement is just another small step in our journey.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:09:00

@_date: 2015-05-26 20:41:38
Unfortunately there is not much we can do about this. At Payza we want to bring our services to as many countries and people as possible but because of licensing and regulations we are not able to serve everyone.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:37:02
So here's a bit of clarification:


With a Payza Business Account you will have the option to directly process credit card payments at 4.99% +$0.59 and your payments will be sent directly to your Payza account, no merchant account would be necessary. These are known as Balance Top Up or Auto-Load payments. Essentially, your customer would be topping up his or her Payza account and using those funds to make payment, but we streamlined the process down to one step for convenience.
I should note, right now this only works with Visa brand cards, but we're working on getting support for other credit card companies as well. Once the funds are in your Payza account, you can withdraw them at any time using one of our convenient withdrawal options. 
More info about direct credit card payments can be found on our blog, the default option for these types of payments is OFF and it is up to merchants to switch it on (see: "Opting in to receive auto-load payments"): 
Top Up/Auto-Load payments have higher fees because the credit card deposit fee is passed on to the merchant or receiver in these cases, the customer pays no fees (standard credit card deposit fees are 3.50%). With direct Credit Card Payments, instead of Payza receiving 6% + $0.25 split between the buyer and the seller, we receive 4.99% + $0.59. For lower amounts this does work in our favor, but in most cases it doesn't (actually the buyer is the biggest winner here, they get a quicker, simpler option and aren't subject to fees).


That's not entirely correct actually, but it is somewhat right. Bitcoin payments are treated as e-wallet payments, you are only charged the 2.50% + $0.25 fee for  receiving either of these payments. So, if you have a $20 item, if a member pays you directly with available funds in the Payza account, or if they pay you by Bitcoin, in both cases you would receive $19.25 to your Payza balance. This includes funds added to that members account by credit card and then sent to you by e-wallet payment. Right now you only have the option to receive Bitcoin payments in fiat currency, we are looking into giving merchants the option to keep some or all of these payments in Bitcoin.
Once the funds are in your account, you would have the option to withdraw them however you like, this includes our Bitcoin Withdrawal option. If you choose that option, your withdrawal would be subject to the 2% spread on our exchange rates. If you chose to withdraw by Bank Transfer (where available), your withdrawal would only cost $0.50.
Sorry if that explanation was a bit long-winded, please let me know if there's anything that wasn't clear or if you had any other questions.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:21:55
Thanks! We opted for the slow and steady route and it seems to be paying off. The feedback has been fantastic, and even the criticism has just served to help us improve these products.
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:50:27
I don't know if that applies here. This product gives Payza merchants a way to seamlessly accept Bitcoin payment while still receiving the same fiat amount they would normally receive. For people looking to spend Bitcoin, you now have many more businesses accepting payment.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:14:09
As mentioned, completing verification before using the Bitcoin Withdrawal feature (and other withdrawal options) is required for compliance. If you are looking for an anonymous way to purchase Bitcoin, unfortunately Payza is not for you.
The 1-3 day processing time is necessary in part to help protect our members if, for example, your account has been compromised and someone tries to withdraw your money to their Bitcoin Wallet. Once the transaction has been approved, the bitcoins are sent and generally arrive within 15 minutes. Note that as you develop a history with Payza, your review times often decrease.
Note that your exchange rate is locked in at the moment you create the transaction, so your withdrawal would not be subject to price fluctuations.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:15:37
The processing time gives our team a chance to check the withdrawal for irregularities and helps protect our members in case the account has been compromised. Once the transaction is approved, the bitcoins are sent immediately and generally arrive within 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:47:28
Hello r/bitcoin, this is a pretty special moment for Payza and we wanted to share it with you. 
We shared the news here early on that we were exploring Bitcoin services, and the encouragement we received was incredibly motivating. It helped lead us to where we are now: 
Today, we're announcing that  members can generate their own multi-use Bitcoin Addresses within their Payza Accounts. 
This new service gives Payza members the full functionality of a Bitcoin Wallet right within their accounts. Any member in a country that allows Bitcoin can generate an address and QR code to easily receive Bitcoin in their accounts.
@_date: 2015-04-10 17:13:31
That is correct. Right now you wouldn't be able to use Credit Card funds to buy Bitcoin from Payza, but if you fund your account by Bank Wire, or if another member sends you funds, you can buy Bitcoin directly from Payza.
Note that you would need a verified account to use the Bitcoin Withdrawal feature. Find more info about Bitcoin withdrawals here: 
Edit: reading the initial question I see this is more about selling Bitcoin, which Payza also lets you do (more info:  You can then withdraw those funds using a variety of methods, Bank Wire or Credit Card being the most popular.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:51:16
Yes! We introduced this option a few years ago actually. With today's update, you can now receive USD and convert those funds to Bitcoin right in your Payza account, and then send those Bitcoin to other Payza members instantly. Or, you can send those Bitcoin to another Bitcoin wallet.
We're able to keep fees very low for Bitcoin transactions. Transferring BTC between Payza members has a 1.2% fee, while sending BTC from your Payza E-wallet to another Bitcoin E-wallet has a small charge to cover the Bitcoin Network Fee.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:53:17
Hello, this update is available in most countries, but if your country does not allow Bitcoin transactions, then you will not see these options.
Bitcoin is now a Currency Balance within your Payza account, you can now Add or Withdraw Bitcoin, exchange fiat to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to Fiat, and transfer Bitcoin instantly to other Payza members.
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:57:33
Hey we made r/bitcoin! This is a pretty big announcement and we're really excited about it, glad to see there is interest from the community here as well.
We'll check back on this thread tomorrow, if anyone has questions about Payza or the newest Bitcoin update, feel free to ask and we'll do our best to answer.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:04:51
Looks like this news has already hit r/bitcoin, but just in case you're looking for a little more info we wanted to share the official Payza Blog post. Find all the details about the latest release and even a look ahead at some other Bitcoin-related features currently in the works at Payza.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:28:59
Actually, right now non-members can pay with Bitcoin at most Payza-merchants, but in the past, those funds would always be converted automatically to fiat. Now, when you receive payments in Bitcoin you'll have the option to decide whether you want those funds converted automatically or whether you want to keep them as BTC in your Payza account.
This video has the step-by-step instructions on how non-members can pay on Payza checkout by Bitcoin:

HI u/MPfoRiNr7azCvQulTtsK, I'm sorry to hear about this negative experience you had with our processing services.
It looks like there are several things going on here that led to your issue: 
At Payza, we allow non-user to go through a quick sign-up when making a direct payment to a merchant using Bitcoin or Credit Card (for merchants that have enabled this process). When signing up this way, you do not create a full Payza Profile, so if you wish to use our services again in the future, you may be asked to complete your profile, and in some cases, to verify your account. 
However, (and this is really the second problem you ran into) when you tried to complete payment, because the cost of your item was so large, international regulations and our own fraud prevention rules require us to have you verify your account. Without more information, I would say this is an issue with our processes. For payments that would trigger these rules, Payza should simply not allow guest checkouts. This issue will be raised to our User Experience Team.
The first issue you faced was the large fees that would be applied to this transaction. It looks like the reason the fee was so high in this case is because your merchant is using Polish Zloty as his currency of choice for accepting payments. When depositing or paying through Bitcoin, our system automatically converts the BTC to USD, if your merchant is accept payment in a different currency, a separate exchange fee is applied to convert those funds (in this case from USD to PLN). So that means that on top of the 2% spread we place on Bitcoin transactions, there was a further fee applied to convert the USD to PLN.
The other issues you faced with funding your account and attempting to make payment, get verified, and finally to withdraw your original funds seem to stem from the way your tried to send funds to your merchant. Your deposit was successful, but because of our fees, it looks like you we about 10 PLN short of completing payment (according to this screen:  ). Your item was 6930 PLN, but you only had the equivalent of 6920.60 PLN in your account, so our system correctly informed you that you did not have sufficient funds to complete your payment.
After making the split payments and then receiving a refund for one of those payments, you tried to withdraw your funds. At this point our system asked you to get verified because it is our policy that members who wish to withdraw by Bitcoin must first be verified. This is due to the risk associated with Bitcoin transactions. 
For the verification issues you faced, I would need to look into this further to know exactly what happened and to know whether there are recommendations I could make to our team to fix any issues.
Finally, our Customer Support Advisor provided you with correct information, and without knowing you part of the conversation, I could not say whether or not he provided a complete answer. If I understand correctly your are trying to get half of your purchase refunded to BTC. We would not be able to reverse half of a deposit, which means you would need to withdraw your funds by Bitcoin (which means your account must be verified).
Writing all this out, I agree that our Bitcoin Checkout procedure can be complicated. We have been regularly refining this feature, and with your help, I'm confident we can improve it further.
I would invite you to send us a private message so that we can review your case in detail and use your experience to help improve our services. Simply provide us with details of your transaction (such as your ticket ID number(s), and/or the transaction reference numbers for your deposits/payments) and we'll respond with more information.

I must have misunderstood. 
It sounds like those funds are now cleared to be withdrawn to your Bitcoin wallet if you wish to set up a new withdrawal. Unfortunately, from what you described, I believe your original withdrawal was declined so it was not possible for our team to release those funds directly to your Bitcoin wallet.

Hello, u/tomasAlpha. Our apologies for the inconvenience. 
I'm happy we were able to get this sorted out for you, but I would also like to point out that our team was simply doing the due diligence they were trained to before releasing those funds by way of Bitcoin withdrawal. Because this withdrawal option is not easily reversible, we do take extra precautions in order to protect our members.
I'm confident that our team would have come to the correct resolution of this issue on their own, but I'm also happy we were able to help you get this cleared up a bit quicker.
