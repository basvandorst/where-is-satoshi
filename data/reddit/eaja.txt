Bitcoin Santa is at it again

Someone was trying to sell 1000+ BTC at exactly 17250 which stops people from selling above the 17250 price point so the price stayed uncharacteristically stagnant for a few hours while people slowly bought up the large volume this person was trying to sell.  On the bottom chart of gdax, it appears as a vertical red “wall”.  Once all of the BTC were sold, the price was free to rise again.  Hope that makes sense.

Go to r/Coinbase, a community of Coinbase victims and join in the collective rage.  Did you send crypto there or fiat? If you sent BTC/LTC//ETH to an incorrect address there may not be much Coinbase can do for you.

Right now Coinbase doesn’t have a lot of competitors. They can charge whatever they want.  But what you pay at Coinbase is a fee typical of a run-of-the-mill currency exchange.  Just wait til you actually try to spend that bitcoin. It will take hours to days possibly with an even larger fee than the one you paid to exchange currency.  If you believe in the technology do research into alts. (r/cryptocurrency) Or be patient until developers can work out solutions to the long waits and high transaction fees.

The growth will very quickly make the fee worth it. But if you don’t want to pay fees in the future download gdax, coinbase’s exchange.  You can send USD there but it takes a few days to process and by that time your investment will very likely have grown far beyond a measly $20 fee.

I can’t even focus on John Wick 2 right now I just keep checking gdax waiting for the wall.

Retweeted. If this happened to me I’d want everyone to get the word out

No you don’t have to post any sensitive info. Bittrex has been disabling accounts willy nilly, just look at Twitter and other users in this thread with similar issues.   They can’t all be lying scumbags. Either way, this is shedding light on a bigger problem and it’s a shame the community won’t give you benefit of the doubt.

I️ wonder if someone was trying to gain access to your account ie multiple password attempts or other attempts to hack into it and that is why it is disabled.

Lol, the next beanie babies.  Mine make me feel all snuggly and secure and I’m going to hold on to them until they are worth something one day.
