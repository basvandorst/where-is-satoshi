The new 7nm chips are being announced and I'm pretty sure a lot of big mining groups have upgraded this year. Canaan just announced pre orders. So hashrate is going up, but electricity use is equal.

I wonder if they will hit the "antbleed" button if shit hits the fan.

You should maybe go look at BTC dominance.

It is. To stay competitive most are turning to green energy. Lots of firms set up near energy sources like hydroelectric where a lot of the power is generated but not used since you cant store electricity very well yet. New and improved chips lower energy consumption. A lot of research is going in to immersion cooling that reduces cooling costs by 98%. 
A lot of the things that we are learning about cooling computers more efficiently could eventually be used to lower power usage in data centers, which I'm guessing use a shit ton of electricity.

Yeah, bcash and Bitmain are so sketch. Bcash would magically drop 20% and Bitmain all of a sudden had stock available and you can only pay with Bcash. Then the price would magically go up and they would conveniently run out of machines.

Someone did this and photoshopped their address into the picture and made a ton of money a while back. Feels bamboozly...

There was I project called cryptomatoes where the excess heat was used to grow produce.

[Lowering energy consumption in every sector is important, but this is one of the more concerning issues.](

I mine bitcoin. Not considered a big mine, but it is about 350Kw. During demand hours I am 100% solar. Vast majority of crypto mining is done near hydro since it is a lot cheaper. You can't store generated power yet so hydro mines give contracts for what is considered "excess power".
Yes, we need to use less power, but sometimes there can be a benefit to stuff like this. Immersion cooling technology is getting a boost. Bitfury does a lot of research with 2 Phase immersion cooling. Up to half of the power needed at large data centers is cooling. Immersion technology can reduce cooling energy usage by 97%. The internet uses a lot of energy and a 97% reduction in cooling power used would be massive.

Pretty sure we're at the point where you need nuclear, hydro, solar or wind to be competitive in bitcoin mining. Mitigating the power bill is everything for crypto miners. Quick Google search, it seems a lot of the places without those types of energy aren't cheap enough to be profitable.

About a month ago I got a chance to sit down with Tim and chat for a while. I was really impressed with his passion for blockchain technology and crypto. His son actually has a VC that specializes in blockchain companies. At his nephews wedding a few weeks ago all the mixed drinks were named after crypto stuff. These guys are true believers and care more about the technology than everything else.

He is definetly not poor rich.

I just moved to UT. Facebook announced a massive data center in Eagle Mountain. Literally walking distance from the NSA. Safe to say they are friends.

Might see a bigish jump soon. The new chips came out several months ago and it has been hard for people to justify buying them. Now the prices are bullish it might bump sales. Last time people were buying ASICs they did around 14Th. Now they are doing 50-60Th. They use a bit more power than the 14Th machines, but power efficiency is much higher.

Draper is a true believer in bitcoin. He is one of the most successful VC in Silicon Valley so bitcoin for him is side money. His son even has a VC that is specific for blockchain and VR products.

He bought the seized silk road assets in 2014 for way less. Probably hundreds for each of his 30k btc.
