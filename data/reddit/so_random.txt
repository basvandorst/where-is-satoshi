actually I would not court those bastards. 
look what they've done to the forex markets and the options and futures markets that were supposed to offer insurance and stability for people that needed to be in a primary market 
(classic case: a farmer buying or selling futures for the crop he really is going to deliver; now futures market is just a faster paced gambling arena)
they will surely find a way to treat it like a game that they can use to suck value out of any economy that grows naturally.  and they will claim they are adding liquidity or offering innovative financial services.  
they'll probably just turn it into an ETF if it gets big and let people speculate on bitcoin via the ETF. and then the primary bitcoin market will start getting all these burps and surges whenever some idiot needs to balance his gamma desk (or whatever the lingo is) in order to make the ETF vaguely resemble the bitcoin index its supposed to track.
but migrant workers sending money home could be THE killer app.

I'm not quite sure how many USD change hands daily on this planet in global trade but I'm guessing its a lot larger than $25k.  I don't think Obama is shitting his pants quite yet.
Probably the Fed doesn't see bitcoin as a threat and are more interested in watching it because it will gives lessons useful for future digital currencies.
Its the use of bitcoin for money laundering and illegal trade that everybody is worried about.

I don't think there are anything like enough day traders to meaningfully give liquidity. market makers do that. a day trader, no matter how big, is not a market maker.
only in very thinly traded stocks can daytraders supply anything.

yeah, I said this here in right after MtGox got hacked and the selloff happened and I got no upvotes at all ;)  totally ignored.
who would throw away such an opportunity to profit ?  someone who had no interest in profiting, but in simply destabilizing the currency market and sowing mistrust.
who has pockets fat enough to do this ? it doesn't take much at all.
you would have to be very naive to think that no banks or governmental operatives have ever messed with the bitcoin market.

just chatted with a tech-savvy guy in ukraine. he has never met anybody using it.  the devaluation is hitting them very hard.  many people have mortgages in other currencies, those just doubled.

interesting, gmail just forced me to reset my password. "suspicious activity".  maybe they just decided to reset everybody that was on that list.  no way it was cracked, and it wasn't the same pwd

I've gotten about 12 of them since last night.  idiots.

if this was a real commodity there would be talking heads on Bloomberg saying "Bitcoin is down today on profit taking ..."  and they would just move on.

massive debt =&gt; devalue currency.  seems like pretty smart regulation if you look at it objectively. 
it may not benefit you personally, but its the only realistic exit.

he probably just reported to his boss that the Goldman Sachs Bitcoin division is operating according to plan. small change.
or if its a large currency trader then its really nothing
@_date: 2011-06-20 13:13:23
so who gains by hacking mt gox and simply dumping the passwords in the open ?  
was it just for the lulz ?  
or specifically in order to discredit and destroy bitcoin ?
mission accomplished

irresponsible headline.  
its dishonest to even waste our time having to follow the link to find out that its just a forum post.  
please try to rise above a Fox news level of decency, thanks.

bitcoin, the viagra of currencies

I had no access attempts besides my own. google changed everybody on the list.  that list is an invite for any idiot to have a go trying it on any site that's out there.

its true, I bought at a 6 year peak and thought I was really blowing it. but that was back at $368
@_date: 2011-06-10 11:05:11
oh you mean specifically with bitcoin market. quite right then, the daytraders are playing that role, and its very necessary.
I thought you meant in markets in general. beginner daytraders often make the mistake of assuming they are providing glorious liquidity when they are really just minnows sucking at the hulls of tankers

Considering the historic spike in price and market cap and the massive media attention around the price right now, the most logical thing to be discussing right now is ... the price.  
And OMG is an entirely appropriate response to such massive volatility.
