Aha, makes more sense to me now, thanks

I think a lot of people forget how heady 2014 was - not in terms of cash but in terms of new altcoins etc. I was never sucked in by this one - but Max was hugely influential to many in those earlier days (in particular) and, whilst I'm a long way from being a fanboy, I do think he's done a great job of continually pushing the fact that decentralised currencies are here to stay. I suspect in three years' time, we'll all be saying the same about, oooh 99.5% of the ICO's that took place this year....

Heartwarming. Well done sir - you're making the world a better place :)

Cool thanks - so basically the inputs/outputs are obfuscated and the transaction history shared is a lot smaller overall, requiring far less storage

Good point - but it was William Gibson

totally agree. I'm as bullish on the open system as the next person on this sub - but to totally discount the marginal-to-average efficiency gains that might be available to large organisation with these different implementations is stupid. If the banks can save money doing something, they'll do it - they're not charities.

I hear good things about Mimblewimble but I'm not clear on the timescales or exactly 'how' it makes a significant improvement - can anyone enlighten me please?

Don't worry, we'll have a crash soon ;-)

Yes it does. If nobody approves of bitcoin, there's zero network effect. No permission required, granted - but I don't think we can underestimate just how important it is when well-known people start to get on board. No-one wants to be left standing alone on the platform, after all...

What makes Vertcoin so likely to match Bitcoin's performance? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:12:43
Yeah that's kind of my point. I think people underestimate just how hard it is to topple Bitcoin on the leaderboard. Not saying it can't happen but genuinely interested to find out where the confidence comes from. I'm all in favour of the concept of being ASIC-resistant though
