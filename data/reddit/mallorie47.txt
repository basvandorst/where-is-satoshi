I think he means "submitted some pull requests".

Well I agree, PoW is literally the last resort where not acting would mean failure.

Any chance of a CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY version of this too?

Roger claims to support non-violence, yet wants to fire people in companies that he has nothing to do with. Genuinely confused here. Roger is angry at his perceived censorship, yet wants Samson Mow [fired]( from his job to silence him. wtf?!

Mining BU is hardly pioneering. Neither is running a Bitcoin ponzi scam

A lot of us are really disappointed at Mycelium for supporting this letter, which is a clear, passive aggressive snub at a large section of the Bitcoin technical community. If it were not, they would have been approached as part of the drafting process. You are assisting Roger with his divisiveness. Please reconsider.

I disagree for a technical reason: if you run a full node that suffers a consensus failure, the worst that can happen is you get forked off the network. Miners however, can do real harm to others, especially to SPV wallets.


The idea that "competing" is a good thing is a result of failed capitalism. The fields of science and medicine are reeling from "competition". 20 years ago, there was global collaboration - now labs are isolated and often replicating the same work which actually slows down innovation.
What we need are more trained Bitcoin developers, so the work of BlueMatt and Chaincode Labs, where experienced Bitcoin developers run training camps is a really good thing.
We need more collaboration, not more competition.

This is a modified version of the original first version, leaked by Samson Mow last week 
It now contains the names of companies that have signed so far. Interesting to see how they have tried to water down some of the barbs against Bitcoin Core developers.
Interesting to note that Bitcoin Core did speak out against censorship [here]( as well as stating very clearly that Bitcoin is completely voluntary, including the software you run. They also make special efforts to enforce voluntarism by deliberately not having an auto upgrade feature, [see here]( (written back in January 2016).
This was also detailed in the recent article by J Lopp from BitGo called ["Bitcoin's Security Model: A Deep Dive"](

Core doesn't have unilateral power, even they have said it over and over again. Supporting an obviously passive aggressive attack on Bitcoin Core developers is incredible.

I see no evidence of competing implementations. What we have seen, is, quite rightly, people implementing full nodes, libraries and so on in other languages which makes it easier for developers of different platforms to start using Bitcoin. All of these platforms seek to be consensus compatible. None of them really seek to be mining nodes, usually on purpose because there is more risk (to the network).
XT, Classic and BU are a new breed of actually competing implementations, but competing for what? They are not competing for market share, they are competing to centralize Bitcoin and shift  control of the system into their hands by deliberately breaking consensus and trying to take the ecosystem with them. There is no sense of consensus building (nor do they even consider peer review or testing to be tenets).
In short, multiple implementations have existed for years and there has never been a problem. Roger is falsely suggesting that multiple implementation is a new thing. it's not.

Well it's sourced from Samson Mow. Seems to be a leak of something that is being prepared in secret.

It's doing the rounds in private by email, they are sharing a Google doc.

What do you mean by "nonviable chain"? Can you explain how the system falls apart?

I'm generally not a fan of Vitalik, but he is a breath of fresh air here.
Occam's Razor applies.

Gavin actually handed over Bitcoin Core maintainership in 2014 to Wladimir  and slowly withdrew from the project, to get involved with XT and then Classic.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:05:49
Some good reasons not to give access back:-
- He's not a Bitcoin Core maintainer, doesn't merge stuff, so doesn't need it.
- Anyone, including Gavin can still contribute with a pull request, like everyone else.
- Gave up his maintainer role over two years ago 
- _If_ he was conned by CSW with something that took Reddit 2 minutes to work out was an obvious fraud, puts a big question on his savvy. That's a security risk.
- Has not renounced CSW's claim to be Satoshi when there is scores of evidence showing CSW to be a fraud. We cant assume Gavin is that stupid, so was he assisting CSW? Either he was conned, or he was complicit - either way, it disqualifies his credibility.
- Gavin still believes CSW is Satoshi, and is on record as saying "14:03 &lt;gavinandresen&gt;	Satoshi can have write access to the github repo any time he asks."
- Gavin has been extremely hostile to the Bitcoin Core project and various members of it for more than 18 months, not entirely sure why people even think he's part of the team.
- **Addendum:** _Even by Gavin used to remove commit access from less active developers years ago when he was the maintainer_  from 
- **Addendum2:** Gavin last merged something over a year ago (2015-05-16)  and hasn't used commit access since.
- **Addendum3:** Principal of Least Privilege 
- **Addendum4:** Gavin was so convinced about Craig Wright, who just bailed out 
Bitcoin Core is not _Bitcoin_, it's just a software project. It _really doesn't matter_. it's up to them and there are plenty alternatives Bitcoin software projects to contribute to.

Where was it posted?
edit: also, to be clear, you're saying that the PDF's of the draft paper were posted right?
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:53:24


It's more honest to look at things from 2014 onwards 
And if you look since for the last 18 months since the start of 2015...  when he basically vanished....

If it's optional, why did you suggest in your paper that miners be paid if they mined blocks containing _only_ permissioned transactions?

@_date: 2016-05-05 00:42:56
It's a ghost town:  (since 2015)
compare that with the active developers in the same period 
pull requests are regular contributons that anyone can make, gavin's last commit was May 2015, **a year ago**.
