@_date: 2017-12-19 16:59:53
Massively undervalued.
Don’t panic sell if it drops 30/40% soon, but HODL. In about 3 years it is $500,000.- +

If you bought 25$ Bitcoin in 2010, you’d have $1600 now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:25
In time the value of Bitcoin evens out and become stable, so in time: yes

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:40:52
Still a small window to buy BTC in the dip, before it seers of to $10,000
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:44:41
Agree, but below 6k is even better...where is it heading......
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:59

@_date: 2017-11-13 18:42:39
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:46:02
