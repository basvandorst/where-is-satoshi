The amount of new bitcoins created are fixed and will eventually stop being created.  The miners cannot just decide to print a ton of extra bitcoin.

Capital losses are tax deductible. You can deduct $3k a year on your taxes and bank the rest. They will cancel out taxes on capital gains in the future

I see no UK pricing in this article your posted
also the note is larger format equivalent to the XS Max, the S9 would be the smaller comparable model to the XS

If changing your stance when it doesn't line up makes you feel like you're correct I guess that great :)
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:06:45
Well then you're arguing with me about something I never was discussing so even more pointless I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:11:40
OK :)

@_date: 2018-09-13 00:53:51
Because you replied to a guy who post prices in pounds and then asked for a source.
If you go to Apple site a 512 XS Max is 1450, but you're correct the guy did miss the Max in his post, but as he is comparing it to the Note then he likely meant the Max model.
You can also get a 128gig Note for 200 pounds cheaper and put in an SD card
Anyway you boil it down though the Samsung equivalent are hundreds of dollars/pounds cheaper than the iphone
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:58:06
So then you're switching your stance from saying that they aren't more expensive to that they are but worth it?
Thats a completely different point and not what you said at all.
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:55:44
I hope so, that gives me 2 years of stacking at low prices before it takes off again :)

You are failing to factor in the fact that you aren't just handing the money to someone else though.  My house costs me a little more than renting would, but I have also have over 100k in equity in under 4 years I've own the place.  I would have spent that money on rent with no return if I hadn't bought.
You own an asset not just a temporary place to keep your stuff and yourself.

Can't you instant buy up to $1k with coinbase with a CC?  I think they charge more for the transaction though.

I can't get paid in Bitcoin but every paycheck I take a percentage of money and immediately purchase more bitcoin.

That wouldn't make much sense as they are both in for equal loss, a much bigger loss than the cost of the item, if they don't both sign though correct?

The 7 billion number isn't based off of the number of people in the world but the number of mobile phones which are capable of sending sms messages.  Smartphones are not required.
He also never said every phone would use it only that they had the potential to do so, just as the numbers for Applepay show how many "poetential" devices there are, obviously not every owner of an iphone will use it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:32:47
Sounds like a pretty healthy relationship you two have going there.
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:38:19
What are you talking about?
I pay less than my house would be on the rental market each month which includes insurance and my property taxes.  Insurance would cover any major unforeseen damage.  Interest and property taxes are all tax deductible and as I said the biggest plus is that the value continues to go up.
You sound like someone who is trying to convince yourself very hard that you're better off not owning a piece of property.
Plus when I do sell there is no capital gains tax on the sale of a home that is your primary residence up to $250k
@_date: 2014-06-04 07:17:30
You are aware that property taxes and income taxes are separate things?  And how tax deductions work?
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:25:39
As 50 cent was the only name that included an actual value for converting I would hope it would be easy for anyone.

Sometimes being reckless is part of the adventure though.  There are safe ways to do most things but often they aren't as fun as the unsafe ways to do those same things.

Continually yes, but just one month?  I put more than 10% of my income into savings every month anyway.  10% of one months income seems to much to you to lose?

Yes, bitcoin itself isn't affected it is the services and holders who are being attacked.
Fiat currency is stolen every day, in many contexts.  That isn't a problem with those currencies necessarily.

When every person you know who's never had an interest in Bitcoin starts asking you how to buy it.
Then you wait a year from that point and buy back in with all of the profit

Very true, but if you drop all interest in the tech after losing money in it then it seems that making money was the bigger concern of the two.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:22:00
Yeah I didn't mean to frame it as it was directed at you, also meant for the public in general.
And while I understand what you're saying, when prices rise and interest is generated, it is mostly not interest in bitcoin technology, its interest in how can this make me money.
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:52:41
It was a joke
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:13:52
If a drop in price turns you off of the technology then it doesn't seem that the technology was ever the real interest.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:08:20
Yes because he isn't interested in them, not because its going to hurt his bottom line.
We all get the sentiment of what you're trying to say but a better example would be to use something that he has actually interest in and abstains from.

Perhaps the ones you've used have never had a passthrough but my old none wireless Xbox 360 was connected into a DVR that passed its traffic to the main ATT unit.  It was connected and worked that way for years.
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:24:07
Yes but you were claiming they will close all of his accounts.  If you have the account you are using for bitcoin activity with a separate bank than the rest it doesn't matter.  That was his entire point.
@_date: 2015-04-11 00:16:10
You can have accounts with more than one bank.  
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:24:30
The ATT DVR boxes previously had ethernet "passthrough" ports so that you would plug in a wired device and it would then go through the DVR to get to the gateway.
Not sure if this is still a thing but it may be what they are referring to.

There are guesses all over the range from low to high constantly.  In hindsight it's easy to pick the one that lined up but that doesn't mean that guess was anything but luck.
