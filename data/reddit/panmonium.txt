Thank fucking god, man. About time someone talked about the importance of taking profits. 
I don't want to be left HODLing the bag when I wait for the price to recuperate for however long. Also, if you have more BTC than you're wiling to lose, that's a good sign it's time to diversify.

I thought the whole idea with "dollar cost averaging" has to do with the fact that the stock market is more or less efficient, so sooner or later your holdings will reflect the actual value of the asset. 
But it doesn't make sense when it comes to BTC because it isn't efficient, as an asset it has lots of problems, and its vulnerable. Investing small amounts over time is just a cautionary measure to avoid getting screwed too horribly.

Can you make a video about how to analyze the ticker? I don't really know what I'm looking at and how different things relate to one another. :(
