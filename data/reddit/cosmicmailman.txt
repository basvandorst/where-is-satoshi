came here to ask this. Deutsche Bank is huge and extremely influential, especially in the incredibly precarious Eurozone economy. The news that came out today might be the first ripple that brings the whole thing down. People have been predicting this for years.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:40:40
what about Sweden, Norway, Denmark? You can't just pick the cases that support your argument. Is Finland's education system not socialist? What about the NHS in Great Britain? Are these things evils that good people should strive to cleanse?

i'm pretty sure he just made that up. socialism just means housing, education and healthcare for all- the scenario he described is an accurate picture of what happens when the United States levies sanctions on a country, but it doesn't have much to do with socialism.

arguably the function of a dump is to consolidate control in the hands of whales who are able to manipulate the price and scare off smaller investors who are in danger of losing their life's savings. don't conflate 'deserving' with 'cynical'
@_date: 2019-11-22 14:29:25
call me an optimist, but i don't see this as a particularly bad thing. the lower price means that i can get more BTC. i'm still confident of the fact that global economic instability will lead to more people and institutions (political and financial) looking to transition away from fiat. BTC is the best option available currently, and as infrastructure expands and adoption increases, the only way for the price to trend is up. I'm not looking at graphs in the short term, i'm thinking of this in terms of 5-10 years.

to piggyback on your comment, institutional investment by huge financial entities has also increased dramatically in the last year (which is problematic because banks/investment funds are evil etc etc) which to me indicates that as instability in global financial markets increases, powerful people are looking to BTC as a possible 'next big thing.'

@_date: 2019-08-26 13:43:42
being as the Swiss are leaders in global finance, especially among the international elite, I take this as yet another piece of evidence that BTC is being accepted as a store of value among influential financial interests, which bodes well for its future. fuck yeah we all bout to get rich, less get this money boys

Markets will follow, is my way of thinking. Smart money (including institutional money) will continue to flow to crypto, and BTC is the best option available.

speaking of capital outflows, i'm curious as to whether the new sanctions on China will increase or decrease the prominence of crypto in that market. i'd imagine that's the reason Hong Kong is a center for crypto trading- traditional point of contact between the Chinese black market and the global economy.

q: "who are these whales you speak of?"  
a: wealthy individuals, financial institutions and investment funds/traders 
q: 'do they communicate over secret channels?'  
a: not that they'd have to do that to make a 20M trade but yes, they probably do, just like in the stock market
q: 'are they all in the same part of the world?'
a: well, yes, the financial centers, same as with the other financial markets: London, Wall Street, Hong Kong
q: 'do you realize how impossible what you're suggesting is to accomplish?'
a: literally in what way is the manipulation of financial markets by wealthy interests in any way impossible or even improbable? you're talking out of your ass.   
yes, whales exist. there's a near-100% chance that the market is manipulated- look at the pattern over the last few weeks, where the price has been dropped by $3-500 and then immediately begins to recover. it just takes a few million at once to do this, because those large fluctuations trigger the algorithms in place on all the traders.   
these powerful interests are trying to buy up as many of the 21 million coins as they can before crashing the fiat markets and adopting Bitcoin as the new currency. So HODL

@_date: 2019-06-30 15:56:25
how you say- sell high, buy low, right? with the idea being that the whales would manipulate the price so that it crashes by 500 or 1000 dollars, so small holders sell their coins, and the whales take the money they made selling at the high price to buy proportionately more coins at the lower price. rinse and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.

everyone? or just a few very wealthy entities? not to sound tinfoil hat, but it's almost like a large segment of coins are controlled by whales, who more or less regulate bitcoin's trajectory. it seemed for a while like the upper limit was set to $13K, and whenever BTC hit 13K it would bounce down to 12K and start back up. Now it seems to be set to $12k.   
I think these influential individuals or institutions are trying to buy up as many BTC as possible before shooting it to the moon. This is a strong argument for holding.

how about coinbase
@_date: 2019-09-10 13:55:43
personally I look less to the BTC charts and more to the newspapers to predict what will happen with BTC's price. I'd say between the China trade war and looming Brexit fuckery in October, this might be our last month to get Bitcoin at this price before it starts going up again- the global economic system is teetering on the brink, and my hunch is that October 15/31 might start some kind of chain reaction. If that happens, people will be looking for another store of value. In a related story, every spare penny of mine for the next month is going to bitcoin. Because I'm trying to get rich.
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:55:35
