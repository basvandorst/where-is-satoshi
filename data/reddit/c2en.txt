Contact their support. Same thing happened to me, took 5 days to resolve. They honored the price I purchased at...which you may not want to request 
I was told their automated system sometimes flags the wrong people. They apologized profusely and fixed it
Good luck!

As asinine as this sounds to everyone on this subreddit I think we seem to forget that despite BTC popularity amongst ourselves the vast majority of Americans do not understand it. It is just gaining mass public visibility. It is not a concept most can intuit naturally, even Senators. 
Due to the fact that a lot of people initially heard about Bitcoins because of the Silk Road or through a news article emphasizing it's use in the seedy underworld, these concerns are very real. Although not necessarily valid. Some people are just hearing about it for the first time. 
I think it was a good thing to be verbally addresses by a high ranking official.  This stigma needs to be publicly squashed once and for all, on the record.
TL;DR this may sound dumb to us but is a concern/question a lot of Americans have. I'm glad it was mentioned by a senator so pro-bitcoiners can educate the rest of the world.

You think they will? I personally feel that they 100% should but after this I am questioning their business practices.

In regard to your comment at the end, does it follow that a person or group with more or a higher proportion of coins have some sort of upper hand on the economy or system?
