Also because of contango (futures trading above spot price, the opposite is called backwardation), you slowly lose your money if you buy these.  The October futures currently trades for $300 above the spot price of Bitcoin.

When it drops, Bitcoin is officially dead. When it's skyrocketing, why didn't I buy this. Unironically how many people seem to think.

Not BTC, BCH. Bitcoin Cash would fork to a different POW (note what I said after), and then be it's own thing again. That would make BTC mining less profitable because all the SHA-256 equipment would mine Bitcoin instead (Bitcoin Cash would need different equipment).

No because you can't get enough hashpower to 51% Bitcoin Cash rented, so you'd have to buy tons of miners. Something you'd have no reason to do if you were not interested in cryptocurrency. You could destroy BCH and then mine BTC, but then they'd just fork somehow (probably POW change), and then you'd be stuck mining a coin that's less profitable since all the Bitcoin Cash miners switched.

There was someone on Bitcointalk who thought that Bitcoin was a total dud and destroyed more than 100,000 BTC. I wonder how they're feeling today. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:00:05
Not even. According to bitinfocharts 16.82M BTC has been inactive for 5 or more years, meaning that less than 1M is active. Most bitcoins were mined before they became valuable so many I imagine are discarded / lost.

On a technical basis, it IS possible, if the red line is broken the target would be roughly 16k  [ .

Bigger issue is that the line starts at 0 which fucks up a log chart. It should start with the first price data, not 0.

He gets more triggered every time the price goes up. The question is at what point does he admit defeat, or will he insist that he is in fact right.

8 Certainly wouldn't cause problems for a decent sized business. Personally I'm more of a fan of the idea that the blocksize limit should be 10% higher than the 30 day EMA of block size, with an upper limit (that could be 8mb). That would prevent free spamming like veriblock, but wouldn't stall growth as much.

Couldn't you use the CBOE futures contract instead of GBTC? You can calculate the premium of GBTC by multiplying it by $1000, so currently it's 12% more expensive to buy 1 GBTC than the equivalent amount of BTC.

It's the point where normal (Non Technical / Liberarian types) were buying in. It's also the first bull run that didn't lead to a equivalent jump in transactions per day.

It's more than 1 million BCH, no way to liquidate that anywhere.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:37:32
Bitmain does, not Jihan unless he took the BCH with him, but if Bitmain goes bankrupt, BCH could temporarily drop to 0, unless they found an OTC buyer. Kraken's entire orderbook for BCH is only around 50k.

At least you didn't give up at $2 because Bitcoin was "dead". 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:40:19
Yeah, it's probably people saying "I want some of those Bit-Coins please", and then the broker finding GBTC on the market and buying without paying much attention. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:37:48
It has a significant premium. Your money would be stored with this company [ who I imagine grayscale has done a decent amount of research on. Coinbase is FDIC insured, so I don't really see the advantage of using it.
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:39:23
They could do what Ethereum did and emergency fork away the 1m that Jihan has.

The Satoshi coins were mined before bitcoin gained any value (even $0.001) as it was not traded. One could argue they were worth the power cost, but that's at most a few hundred $ for the million coins. in 2010 the first real life transaction (the pizza) would of been 0.003C per coin.

Definitely a scam. Claims to be around from 2013, but has no web archive, your post and Bitcointalk is the only search results for it.
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:33:55
Hopefully not with huge amounts. I remember one ETH scammer I tracked had made over $250k in an hour.

Cobra's explanation makes the most sense: [ . The mempool was still filled with higher sat transactions, so it's not a natural confirmation. The sad thing is that he would have won the bet regardless, so it was just a dumb cheat, no real reason to do it.

It's not promoting Bitcoin Cash, it's promoting Bitcoin as a type of Cash. Bitcoin Cash comes up as "change" for some reason: [ . Dogecoin is a "currency" and litecoin is a "coin" I think it's simply nonsensical.

Delisting of it from every major exchange makes the pump a lot easier. No margin shorting either for BSV, so very little non insiders can do.

For a moment I was expecting it to be a 10x offer, but that'll suffice as well.
