No blockchain.com is not the bitcoin blockchain. No one owns it.
A wallet is just an app that connects to the network and has access to an address or addresses. You can use many wallets for he same address. 
Think of a wallet as a GUI app to interact with your address easier.
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:18:47
I mean sure, however they do not know or have access to your keys. Just use a wallet that is trust worthy enough. I'm pretty sure they do not see your private keys, it'll be encrypted. 
Directly accessing them, well you'd have to go through bitcoin core api and such which is probably even less safe as it can be prone to user error.
If you pick a well known wallet, you shouldn't have any trouble. I've not heard of wallet companies going rogue, like I said it's highly unlikely they even have access.
