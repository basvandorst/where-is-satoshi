So use stocks to buy goods and services?  I don't know, I think you should trade stocks based on math and news, not when you need tampons for your pussy.

There's no way he's getting out of this unscathed. He will most definitely pay, one way or another.

I know you're joking but really, who knows how many criminal organizations he's fucked over.  We all know crypto is great for  laundering and transferring money undetected and the sheer amount of money lost in this monumental fuckup means he's more than likely pissed off the wrong people.  If I was Mark, I would be spraying frappacino in my pants right now.

Can you explain to me why he's so ridiculous?   I support BTC as a viable currency in the long term but right now it make zero sense to me.  It's understandable you guys feel it's important to push and promote the currency front despite price instability, but sometimes it comes off as mindless fanaticism.

"As there is a lot of speculation regarding MtGox and its future, I would like to use this opportunity to provide you with no information whatsoever."

It's about as coherent as any interview I've seen with that babbling smug sack of shit and I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote that statement himself.

I totally agree with that list, but the common theme is circumvention of local and international law.  As of right now I won't be using BTC to buy a car or a pack of gum.  Certainly not spending any BTC on a fucking vaporizer.

Ok I can see Shitterplug is full of shit, however I still wouldn't use BTC as a currency unless I was doing something shady on Silkroad.

Are you talking about this?


Can you explain why you trust whatever's being posted over there? It's all just speculation isn't it?

Gox continued to accept deposits well after they new nothing could be taken out. There are no fucking heroes here.

So you're telling us that you wouldn't get all pissy if all your USD was seized because that's like the circle of life? I mean really c'mon man.

What makes you so sure? Because of a tweet? You really trust these guys?
