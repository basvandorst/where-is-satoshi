I'm honestly excited by the tech behind cryptocurrency and I think there are real world applications for it, but Bitcoin is a currency masquerading as a commodity. Bitcoin itself has no real world application (currently). It's being held and traded based on nothing but mass hysteria.
You've probably read about tulip mania so I won't go into detail, but the similarities are shocking.
It's fascinating as an outsider, but I'm worried for the average uninformed investors who might have overextended themselves during the gold rush.
Do you own BTC?

No, because the true value of bitcoin is the price someone is willing to pay for bitcoin. It has no intrinsic value. At some point, when people aren't willing to bid what you're asking, it all comes tumbling down and you're left holding your tulip bulbs...err I mean bitcoin.

Agree with you here. If it's 'fun money' I sell enough to cover my initial investment (if things go well). Everything on top of that is gravy.

I love the certainty you speak with. Another reason it's going to fail.

The price for gold and silver have both been price fixed since the 80's (see gold fixing [here]( ). 
To your point about silver, I would argue that the industrial applications are actually what's keeping silver prices so low.
But back to the main argument, what you're referring to isn't value, it's market price. In the short term, market price is driven by what people are willing to pay for a stock, but that has nothing to do with the intrinsic value of a company. 
True value is not determined by what someone is willing to pay for it, but by the underlying *health* of the company. This is fairly obvious when you compare the price of stock vs the company's balance sheets and key fundamentals (PE ratio for example).
To say that the value of *anything* is based on what someone else is willing to pay for it is false. 
The problem with all cryptocurrencies is there is no underlying intrinsic value. The only thing driving the price of BTC (or the thousands of other coins) is what someone else is willing to pay for it. A dangerous game indeed.

It's fascinating.

This, in a nutshell, is why bitcoin will fail.
