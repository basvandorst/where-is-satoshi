Thanks. I've seen some reports of poor service (eg.  have you used them by any chance?

Well, what I like about tips is that it is a good way to introduce people to bitcoin. I've sent tips to newbies to encourage them to try use bitcoins. These people don't have a wallet yet.

I use both Coinbase and Circle, connected to my chase. No problem.

Ok, maybe that's what I don't understand about Changetip. Why does it need to access the email?

There are a lot comment here, how about using all this energy to add comments to LastPass to show that their customers want bitcoin. So head to

I think you can only pay for items sold directly by Newegg and not by another reseller. I had two items, one from newegg and one from another reseller, and I didn't see the option. When I removed the item from a reseller, I was able to see bitcoin option

Right, I understand that you can send a private key with some amount BTC. I am curious why ChangeTip doesn't support logins with an email so people can tip via email. Is it for security, business decision, something else?

same here, are the conditions to when this option shows up?
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:12:55
Oh, I didn't know I could do that. I'll check it out.

Well, isn't that how any other referral with a direct link work? I send an invitation to an email, user signs up and confirms their email address, once they create and account I can see that they used my referall. Presumably the same can be used here, a tip is sort of a referall.

Open source it and perhaps people will contribute. You're on to something here, so keep it going. Maybe this will grow into becoming your full time job :) I've been looking for BTC projects and would be interested in participating. PM if want to chat

Any other suggestions? I'm gong to Japan and find it surprisingly difficult to find mentions of any place that take bitcoin (besides pink cow)

I stopped by Pink Cow last week and was disappointed to learn that their Bitcoin machine was down. Something about the software .. mmmk. 
At least I was able to buy a drink with BTC
