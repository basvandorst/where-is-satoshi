What about the owner of the property you're driving on?

Hypocrisy has no hold over these people, they're locked in and wave around "logic" in the process. Utterly contemptible.

You earn the most utterly contemptible imitation of a human being award of the internet today.

Then you should know that there's absolutely no way to drive intoxicated without destroying property (physically impossible); source: a gaggle of civil engineers in my family. You see, even if you're *not* impaired, you're breaking the road down to some degree, if you're impaired you're doing it much more so than usual, since you're not capable of driving as straight and even impaired vs sober.

You really need to learn how to read. Though considering your viewpoint is massively dumb, it doesn't surprise me that your reading comprehension skills are below that of a rotted fish.

Using slavery when whinging about your pathetic problem was the most vile and contemptible appeal to emotion, you scum sucking hypocrite. I wish you were taken and sold, so you could have a real appreciation for what slavery *actually* is and *actuallly* means; horsewhipped daily, and die from the infected wounds.

The founding fathers don't know the first thing about a modern geo-political/economic landscape. I have toenail clippings with more credibility. Using what would have been their intent (stipulating that you know their original intent; pro tip: you don't, nobody *really* does) is like asking a pre Semmelweis surgeon for advice about brain surgery.

good show, re-defining words is the mental gymnastic that allows your ideology to make "sense".

Belief in the NAP is a hostile act.
