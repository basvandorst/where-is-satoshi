Wouldn't this just essentially be an interactive faucet. Make the thing ad supported and it wouldn't be that different. Make it so you can't click faster than the calculated drip and you get a payout if your score is above a certain amount once a week. Also allow people to use the currency on in game content so they slow themselves down, or import bitcoin in to buy bigger items that you couldn't easily get by playing the game.

I've actually been thinking about this a lot. I was involved in some of the protests, mostly outside of NYC, but I did visit during. 
There is no email address that you can just say "hey have you heard of bitcoin", because they have, but like most don't really understand it. You would need to be on the streets in a protest camp to encourage adoption. Dogecoin may have a better chance due to its tipping culture but if people were willing to give away as well as sell bitcoin on the street you would see adoption. If you only sold it you would get tons of pushback from the community. Simultaneously you would need a tounge-in-cheek vendor selling food exclusively for bitcoin while denouncing the bankers currency, and again I use sell lightly, you would be giving away food as well if you wanted to be invited by the community. You would likely sell at a loss by end of day but you would have educated a very active vocal bunch about bitcoin. The entire thing needs to be street theater with an education component. Having a negative attitude about protests in the streets won't get you very far with them though. 
To be honest though you would probably have a better chance with an alt coin developed to enforce economic equality, where the poor can't get too poor and the rich can't get too rich.
