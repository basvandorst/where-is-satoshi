Well, the logical conclusion to what you present is that the prices of bitcoins will go up. MtGox makes sellers find buyers. When there are more buyers than sellers, only highest-bidding buyers will get served, giving an incentive to propose higher prices until an equilibrium is reached again.
It is why so many people keep bitcoins without using them : they expect the price to go up as soon as many people will want to buy some.

Well, YES! You should say when a feature is implemented by OT or by another third party. What would you say if Reddit said "well our users are totally anonymous" and didn't say that this assumed the users were using TOR?


Seeing such affirmations makes me shiver. No, it is not byzantine, it should be clear. The algorithms are not very complicated if you know the basics of crypto.

That link still does not explain why Open Transaction is necessary when you already have a Web Of Trust and bitcoin. I may be dense, but I don't see what it adds to the proposition. Contracts can be signed with GPG, reputation checked with WoT and money exchanged through BTC.
It seems to offer something similar to colored bitcoins but with a very obscure security or trust model.
I have tried to understand OT in a previous post anouncing a reward (isn't it telling that even with such a bounty, no one works began working on it? ). Is anyone here understanding OT well enough to offer a technical overview about how it works?

If you are worried about what may happen to your money, the wikileaks scandal has shown us that neither Paypal nor Visa nor Mastercard are to be trusted. Bitcoin is a superior medium in that respect.
Bitcoin can be as safe as Paypal and it can even be safer. No one can cancel your transaction.
For an undisputably legitimate business such as wikipedia, I guess the safest way for them would be to regularly convert their bitcoin wallet into local currency, so that a breach of security could not steal the integrity of their wallet.

If you have ISO recognition, software that follow the ISO specs must implement the XBC code, even just to say that it is unsupported. That means that every firm who writes ISO software will have to answer the question "Do we support bitcoin?" and escalate it up to management which will inevitably reply with "bitcoin? What is this?", leading to awareness at very strategic places.
Some may even consider that yes, they would support it, or just put a placeholder for future development. Some may call bloomberg saying "well, we have this bitcoin thing but the guys at MtGox don't seem that reliable to us... Couldn't you provide a quotation for this hippy thing?"

Interesting definition of a definition. 
I agree that calling a bubble a Ponzi is a bit of a stretch but I think the comparison holds on every point except one adjective, that can actually be discussed : fraudulent. There are, however, people who recognize bubbles before they burst and still invest in them, participate in their hype, in order to profit from them. It is fair to call them fraudsters. The difference is that usually bubbles are not created 100% by fraudsters. 
However, a bubble where non-profitable new companies have clients which are non-profitable new companies buying at loss from each other on investors money, is actually a scheme where early investors are paid by later investors. The difference with the original Ponzi scheme is that the investors can be in different companies. If you know of a more appropriate name, I am interested. 
I don't think that Krugman was really serious when saying these were the same phenomenon, my understanding is that this was more a way to attack the concept of the "invisible hand of the market", showing that if we anthropomorphize it, in the case of bubbles it is responsible of Ponzi-scheme and should be jailed it with Madoff.

The most simple cryptographic algorithm, the XOR, is invincible if you use a one-time key. This is a huge constraint : you need a key the size of the message you want to send. 
However, if you are forced to provide a key, you can produce one that will "decipher" into anything you want. If you destroy the part of the key you have already used (as you should do) this system is invincible.

@_date: 2012-10-22 03:18:54
The value of bitcoin raises when their scarcity becomes a problem. It becomes a problem when people want to use bitcoin to buy stuff. If the number of people and the number of uses for bitcoins stay constant, the price has no reason to go up.
If it goes up, it has no reason to do so exponentially.
In the physical world, gowth that look like exponentials are usually the first part of a sigmoid, that is a transition between two states.
The current value of bitcoin is flawed by the many people who expect it to raise exponentially. I believe it is still much higher than its true value. It would be necessary to know the volume of real transactions that are made daily (i.e. bitcoins vs. stuff, not just moving bitcoins around accounts owned by the same person) to get an idea of the "right price" of bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-11-18 06:15:53
The thing is, because of their licence, it can not be included into OSS repositories and that means it won't be well packages to be compiled by a trustworthy party. Most people under windows will just download the binaries from the website and run that because compiling it yourself is a nightmare.
The compilation step a weakness in the trust chain. You are trusting anonymous persons to run binary code.

@_date: 2012-11-06 23:41:46
You are not talking about bitcoin. I guess you are not suggesting to attribute vote to people depending on their CPU power.
You are maybe talking about a DHT, that allows a decentralized system to agree on a state, but this becomes totally useless once you realize that you need a central authority to check IDs.


Now you are getting me angry. I want to encourage you going forward if you think this is a good idea, but you have to know that this is a **very old** idea. Voting systems are discussed by crypto geeks since forever, the mathematics of voting and trust are studied extensively. You did not do proper research and when you will do, you will find that hundreds of people have the same idea, some even having tried to implement it, and you will call them thieves.
Stop thinking that ideas are worth anything. Ideas are worth 2 cents a dozen. The realization is everything. Be the first or be the best. But this idea is old, the way you propose to implement it is flawed, and instead of seeing thieves, you should seek for people who thought it over a bit more than you and steal *their* ideas. Most of them will probably be more than happy about you doing that.


You are also missing understanding about what bitcoin is. 
I want to encourage you, though. Follow that idea, learn what would be necessary to implement it, see what problems will arise. I bet you 10 satoshis that you will realize it is not a workable idea. But then you will have gained knowledge that will be useful in discovering better adjusted ideas.
@_date: 2012-12-03 01:03:24
My points remain.


OT pretends to implement all these. Let's start with the one I'll be most familiar with : untraceable digital cash. Is this sentence supposed to be understood as "API to use bitcoin easily" or is there an implementation of something similar, somewhere?


You have to be kidding me. This is a core, essential, totally no-go vulnerability. So, you have to trust servers, attacks are possible. What other wonders are there in OT land? If done correctly, the kind of auditing you propose would amount to a DHT, which seems critical for this scheme to be taken seriously.
You have to understand that when talking about this kind of features, we assume scenarios where dozens of hostile servers are a possibility. Bitcoin resists in this scenario, that's what made it a very credible technology. 




This is a serious question : what is the use of the server? To make a non-trustworthy server useful, you have to hae some kind of trick. I never saw it explained. But you did it above. You actually trust servers. 


Well, something as complicated as the blockchain was not implemented just for fun. Its role is to make souble-spending operations impossible. Off-blockchain are faster but riskier. Sure, you can find the author of the double spend after the fact, then what? Your system is anonymous, right? 
Such services exist today, but unless OT, they are not shy about the new assumption they make : they need a trustable issuer to do this kind of things. At least an issuer that you can trust during the time it takes for a new block to be added in the blockchain. It is **alright** to do so : we don't have other solutions and the risks are clear, well explained. It is **not all right** to pretend that you do the same thing without having to trust a thirs party.


Oh really? Then I will be more than happy to see your implementation for a fast off-blockchain transaction that prevents double-spends and doesn't require to trust a server.
Is this implemented? If yes I am willing to revert my criticism totally. This would be a game changer.

Well the main characteristic of something usually called a Ponzi is that the early entrants make money based on an increase of the number of entrants while thinking the value is gained through another mean. Arguably this is what happens in a bubble. Krugman once called bubbles “natural Ponzi schemes, in which Bernie Madoff’s place is taken by the invisible hand of confusion”.
The difference between a bubble and a Ponzi scheme is that the latter is a deliberate fraudulous scheme that implies conscious lies while the former can happen naturally.

Yet, cracking requires a flaw to exist. You assume there is always one, it is a very common meme, which I argue is false. You assume a dumb user or a vulnerability to malware, which are easy to remove. 
You are basically saying that no lock is foolproof because there will always be the possibility to break through the windows, assuming there will be always one.
Crackability has its limits, it takes efforts to engineer a system beyond these, but saying it is not achievable is a really damaging false idea.

While true, I am not sure how this is relevant. BSD and GPL enforce different thing. BSD only keeps a single version of a software free (to redistribute, copy and modify) and the GPL sees a piece of software as a version and all its derivatives. It is two different vision of what a software is, really. 
GPL enforces some freedom on a software version and its derivatives, BSD only enforces them on a single version. If you adopt GPL's view of what software is, you'll see the BSD as incomplete, is you adopt BSD's vision you'll see GPL as over-protective.

It didn't really help clarify. A bit of constructive criticism:
You should make the trust model more obvious. Is there a need to trust a third party or not? Or is this a decentralized system a la bitcoin where you have to compromise a whole network to do malicious actions? Is this even related to bitcoin?
From what I understand, you have to trust some operators to manage "real" assets. These assets have a virtual representation that can be exchanged easily through a crypto system. Is that accurate?
You should explain what new technology you provide or if you only use already known tools, list them. From what I understand, you use a DHT to store many things. I am not even sure of all the things you store. Some things seem to be stored in a DHT and others in a federation of centralized servers. 
I don't think that it is a good idea to constantly oscillate between layman's explanation and technical explanation. Do one or the other.

Well, I would welcome a software that easily automates exchanges of crypto-signed contracts. And I would be fine if OT stated clearly that this is what it does, but OT pretends to be a tool at the same level of bitcoin, presumably it does more. It has a complex (and, as far as I can see, pretty useless) scheme of exchanging tokens with a server that may or may not (I have been told both) be actually a DHT. It seems to rely on an external, unspecified, web of trust.
So I guess, the first of many questions is :
- Does OT include a DHT (apparently not), does it require to trust a third party server, or are these servers totally useless?
The second is :
- Is OT more than an interface to make it easier to dual-sign contracts?
@_date: 2012-12-02 06:28:18
I don't see OT as a competing technology, I see OT as an undefined technology. It proposes to do dozens of marvelous things without ever explaining fully in details how it proposes to implement it. 
I never saw anything that OT proposes to do that requires anything more than GPG signatures, BTC and a Web of Trust. 
No one can provide a clear list of capabilities and assumptions, of the security and trust model. For instance :


This can't be done if what you use to store OT is a DHT similar to bitcoin. It can be done however if you are willing to trust a third party. I have been told both stories : you have to trust a server or there is no one to trust, everything is a DHT.

What do you mean "crash"? Ultimately, the bitcoin network is a mathematical object that is well defined (and, may I add, easy to understand if you know what a hash is). If tomorrow a new stuxxnet comes and shuts down all of the bitcoin nodes at the same time, it won't be a problem : it will be restored from saved blockchains. In that respect, bitcoin can not "crash".
If you are talking about an economic crash and a loss of value, well, this is the risk with every currency. Bitcoin is more volatile and not backed up by any national entity, though some days it looks safer than the euro or the yuan.

Well giving dishonest information to attract investors qualify as fraud. The trick is, it is very easy to pretend you were honestly mistaken while you were purposely deceiving. 
I made a mistake in my description of the phenomenon I am trying to describe : Imagine a company A which gets funded through investors in a new field, it finds a client as company B, also newly funded running on investors money. A becomes profitable, while B is still not. C uses the example of A to show that this field is profitable, gets funded for several years, buy many things from B, which becomes profitable, attracting more investors in the field.
I guess the idea is the same as a Ponzi scheme, but using a whole field instead of a single company : early investors in the field are paid through new investors.

Well a bubble was easy to predict for any *successful* currency. But when it was at $.02, any other fork was as likely to succeed. Imagine that the developers disagreed, split, and that a new "bitcash" blockchain was created, this one gaining traction. 
If you invest all your life savings, even at $0.02, that is still all your life savings, and BTC could very well have stopped plunging at 0.0001$.
Note also that at the time this would have required to trust MtGox far more than was reasonable, but I did make a fair amount of money by being an early miner. Sold 50 BTC almost at the peak. I personally was surprised at the speed it gained traction. I considered the fast bubble to be an unlikely scenario so early. I thought it would take a few years to reach one dollar.

It is called a hostile server. If I make a double-spent transaction, how long will the system take to discover this fraud?

Most people do not understand how the dollar works, I wouldn't be surprised if most eutrepreneurs did not understand it either, yet they are actively finding new ways to make dollars circulate.
And I have actually looked at the algorithm behind bitcoin, it is fairly easy to understand : it is a DHT and an algorithm that takes the table, adds a salt, hashes it, and changes the salt until it gets a certain number of zeros in the hash. If you are an experienced programmer, you can understand the code in one or two weeks.
I'd be more comfortable proposing a fork to bitcoin than a patch to the linux kernel...

I'm sick of plain-english, overview, simplifications, video tutorials.
I want to understand the underlying assumptions, security model and trust models and how they are implemented. I can do that in 3 paragraphs for bitcoin, yet no one seems able to do it for OT.
The more I read these badly written page, the more I suspect hidden assumptions in OT like the necessity to trust servers, or the ability to double-spend in a variety of scenarios.
Here is what I understood so far :
* Transactions are contracts between 3 parties : 2 contractors and a server. A transaction is signed by the 3 parties.
* It is stored somehow, presumably in a DHT.
This link :  is a set of requirement, it says nothing at all about how an implementation can be done.

Aren't you building a strawman here?
By the way, the legal practices surrounding copyright applied to code are indeed weird, and we lack objective metrics to what constitute a work of software. However, human judges to their best to try and find reasonable compromises. A band can not copyright a chord or a set of notes, and computer programs can imitate one without infringing (on copyright, the patent laws is far more ridiculous in the countries that accept the idea that algorithms are patentable). However, the problem that no one ever wanted to explore is an objective measure of difference between two programs. If we had that, we could make tool to automate "code laundering".
This is another issue that has nothing to do with GPL vs BSD.

Bitcoin seems to be, right now, the simplest form of assets trading that we can implement without trusting a server. So if I understand correctly, Open Transaction is a kind of colored coins implementation?

Blockchain crash is not much a thing. This is as proposing a "cryptographic crash" and supposing that cryptographic algorithms will, at one time, stop to work. There could be a mathematical flaw in bitcoin (it is as robust as the SHA algorithm, used by Very Serious People) but even that would not spell its end, and if a flaw is discovered in SHA, bitcoin won't be our first problem.

Uh... the reaction is very straightforward to predict. People who know elementary school maths could understand that the built-in scarcity of bitcoins would make its value increase if it had any success as a currency. Expectation of growth often leads to bubble.
This would be pointed as an obvious flaw if the system was not designed to be resistant to these. It it and it uses them.

Well, people buying a lot of BTC on MtGox make the value rise, they may believe that this is the money catching up, while it is just speculation.
It fits the definition of a bubble, and if, like I believe, this behavior is intentional, it fits the Ponzi scheme. But like I said, it is just using a bubble burst in order to seed the currency, which is not a bad thing at all...

I have often argued that bitcoin has a seeding phase that *is* a Ponzi scheme, that it is there by design, that it is a good and useful property of the system.
The crash after the $30 peak was the crash of the pyramid. The result was that a lot of people now had installed the bitcoin client, owned coins and that the seeding phase succeeded.
It was more a bubble than a Ponzi scheme, actually. In Ponzi schemes you offer dividends usually. In bitcoin, people understood that due to the scarcity of bitcoin, if it had any success, it was assured to reach a higher value. Large groups of people buying into this belief made it self-fulfilling and fueled the bubble. Now it has burst after people realized that it was speculation, not scarcity, that made this value rise and is fairly stable ever since. I am still amazed that it is still above one dollar to be honest.

Usually, when a court wants to find tax fraud, they look at declared revenues, they look at the lifestyle and act when there is an obvious imbalance. If you declare a minimum wage while having a boat and villa, they will ask you how you managed to pay for these with your revenue. 
Even if you manage to prevent them from linking you to your bitcoin wallets, they can decide that some kind of monetary transaction occurred undeclared and declare you broke the law.
Yes, that is partly arbitrary, but do not think that bitcoin provides a perfect tax evasion tool. It provides a (potentially, but in practice it is quite hard) anonymous way to transmit financial tokens but this is usually only half of the trade : anything physical that is transmitted can often easily be linked to a physical person.

In an election, a typical case would be that a candidate could win depending on the degree of unification of its opponents. This is not perfect, but if you are interested in Arrow's theorem, this is actually the crucial point and the crucial imperfection we have to deal with : the quality of a candidate, and its likelihood to be elected, is not independent of its opposition's organization, and cannot be.

I don't feel bad and I know quite a bit about crypto. I actually first came into this thread because I am a competent developer and thought I could help if the project seemed worthwhile. I am saying I am not understanding, because through my knowledge of cryptography, I see the server as unnecessary to certify that both parties agreed to a transaction. A single untrusted party of the transaction can show a packet signed by the other party and therefore prove that it really occurred. That is the point of crypto signature. This scenario is probably simplified to the point of being oblivious of some important features of OT.


Can you try the complete, complex way? Right now I can read a bunch of scenarios, which all seem to happen either through magic or through trusting an unspecified third party.
I now see a new constraint : not storing transaction history while still being able to prove that a transaction really occurred. I don't know blind signature but I figure that with a kind of hashing it can work. Here again, I have to make several assumptions because I don't see the interest of not storing transaction or of storing certificates of them. 
But it helps me understand a bit better what OT is : you want bitcoin, but you don't like that one can trace the transactions back a long way. I understand. I often disagree on the statement that bitcoin offers anonymity. If you want anonymity, you have to do some kind of money laundering at one moment and the publication of the transaction history makes that, in some respect, harder than with actual cash. 


I am not saying that this is possible to do serverless, I am merely saying that I do not understand the problem because it is never stated completely and when servers are put into play, it is never stated completely how they do operate and what the trust model is. These information are important because they allow to understand how much harm a single malicious server can do, or a trio, or 51% of the federation? If I want to corrupt a network of 1000 machines, is it as cheap as putting 1001 new machines in it? What mechanism prevent that? 


I can read. You can't quote videos, you can't copy paste to research a term, and as a non-native speaker, listening to English videos is tiring. Video is the worst format to publish technical information. Is there a text for people with technical skills somewhere that details a bit how OT works? Right now it doesn't look like something I could really trust.

The source is [here]( and the quote is not the main criticism that Krugman has toward bitcoin. He does not compare bitcoins and dollars, but bitcoins and gold, two currencies he thinks are equally bad, and bitcoin deriving its value, contrary to gold, only from its acceptance as a payment method. This is not his argument, nor the point where he is (IMHO) wrong in this article.
He argues that bitcoins and gold suffer from the same flaw : the inability of the government to create more of them when necessary. Now bitcoiners and Krugman disagree on a core thing: the former believe that a constant policy is better than the Fed's. Krugman believes otherwise. I am myself not sure where I am standing. One thing is for sure : the Fed can do better than a constant policy, and it can do worse. So preferring bitcoins to dollars is actually a bet on the future competence of the Fed.
No, where Krugman is wrong is when he says this :


Bitcoiners understand very well that there is a huge psychological accept in the acceptance of any money, but the determination of its value is a function of its scarcity and its acceptance. Bitcoin removes one variable from the equations : the printing press.

Wait, this is not the whole story...
The article says that what has been changed is the government-issued exchange rate with dollars (4.3 to 6.3), to go into the direction of the black market value (18.4 !). 
All that changed, is the official rate. The existence of a very high black market rate indicates that this rate was anyway a fiction more akin to a tariff than a rate.
What is **doesn't** mean is that people with 100 bolivars on their account did not wake up with 54 on them. It didn't raise the amount of taxes by 46% either. The only people who are hurt are people who need dollars for their business and manage to get some from the government.

Banks failure? I don't know, either you believe in capitalism or you don't. If you don't let banks fail, you send the message that they can take risks on public money. Remove the incentive to evaluate risks correctly and you'll have to constantly bail banks out.
5 years ago, a lot of banks were helped, the system was supposedly "cleaned up" and now that happens. 5 years is a short time to forget the lessons of Lehman Brothers. I am sure that now everyone will claim in 6 months that every error has been corrected, that the system is cleaned. Who is next? Italy in 2016? Spain in 2015? 
Or you don't believe in capitalism : If it is the government that bails banks out when they fail, then it is the government that must operate banks. Either directly by making this a public service (I personally would be all for it) or through a central bank, which means leaving the eurozone.
But bailing private banks out with public money is the worst possible scenario : it means you don't trust capitalism to correct its errors but don't trust governments to know how to manage its money.

Actually, you know, I am not sure which one is the most efficient. Let's try to find out.
The whole bitcoin network currently spits ~ 65 000 GHash/sec.
Let's see the [efficiency of hardware used]( At best, if everyon uses Avalon ASIC  to mine, the whole system consumes 620 kW. 
I think a more realistic figure would be to assume that a fair share of the network does not use specialized hardware but rather common GPU, that are 50 to 100 less efficient. I think the total power consumed should be around a few MW.
It currently takes 509 seconds to generate 25 BTCs (~20 secs per BTC). Extrapolating (because BTC vary wildly depending on years considered), and considering a 100$/BTC price, that means the bitcoin network generates 154 millions dollars worth of currency during a year. At 15c/KWh, that means the bitcoin network uses between $800,000 and $8M worth of electricity per year, or between 0.5 and 5 cents per dollar generated.
According to this site :  the production of bank notes costs around 0.02 cents per dollar printed.
So the bank note wins easily. I guess that the minting of coins would increase the cost of dollars but then we would have to also include the basically free creation of electronic money through the Fed. 
Of course BTC really shine when it comes to secure international transactions or move around big sums of money. There are many arguments to say that this comparison is not entirely fair, but I think the elements I found are enough to dismiss the notion that bitcoin is a particularly energy-efficient system.

Actually no, the verification is very cheap in terms of power needed. The verification of transaction does not use a lot of energy, but deciding who gets the reward of the next block is actually a lottery where the tickets are paid in computing power. 
Bitcoin is designed around the notion that you can make a computation arbitrarily difficult so that people succeeding in it have proven they have a given amount of processing power. The more people in the network, the higher the [difficulty]( rises.
I agree that this power is not really wasted in the sense that it is necessary for the system to work. However, from Krugman's point of view, one could argue that trusting an authority would be more power-efficient. 
This is the same kind of disagreement between someone who argues that using a personal car is wasteful when you have public transportation vs the person who argues that the independence gained is worth the additional fuel burnt.
And for the record, I don't really have an opinion on these two different issues. As a hacker I simply find bitcoin fascinating. Judging if it is a good or a bad thing is not really a concern in my engineer's mind : it is a thing, and we have to deal with it, use it if we can make the world better thanks to it.

Coherency is not just a philosophical balance. In the present case, it is a very serious economics matter : if the people who take the risks are not the people who pay in case of failure, you are creating a situation that is just broken and where the incentive that is at the basis of capitalistic finance is not present anymore.
Worse : without bailouts, people who managed failing banks will be seens as failure and their style of management will be decried. With bailouts however, these people will be seen as geniuses in risk mitigation **and will be rewarded**.
This is not just a problem of philosophical coherency, this is a problem of designing a system that is actually working correctly. I do believe that capitalist finance can work, but you have to design the incentives correctly.
It is like choosing between a ship with a sail or an engine and finally deciding for a 'middle ground', that is a ship with lots of ropes, an engine and no propeller.

Why limit yourself to 50% ?
You wouldn't be labelled an attacker if you obeyed the bitcoin protocol and did not add transactions. At more than 66% of the CPU power of the network, you are indeed a problem because you can potentially corrupt the blockchain, but you are not forced to do that and the network don't have any mechanism to expell such a concentration of CPU (that could trivially be split stealthily over several node btw)
I don't think the price would rise much : the other miners still mine at the same speed until you hit the second halving. By the way, in this configuration, you don't mind BTCs' price rising as you are not buying them directly.

Yes. My understanding is that Tor offers a layer on top of IP protocols (or TCP maybe) while I2P replaces them. It means that most applications will work out of the box on Tor, but will require modifications to work on I2P, hence the reward for a bitcoin client. The basic client can already work over Tor without modifications.
@_date: 2013-02-11 00:18:05
It would just mean that blocks would be generated more slowly, like in the good old days. Ten block a days still allows it to work correctly.
Bitcoin can continue to live on a separate network, making some sort of a natural fork. The blockchain in Egypt would react like internet suddenly lost 90% of its population. The problem would be that when reconnecting, the blockchain that continued outside Egypt would disagree on who got the rewards.
It would be interesting to see these merge correctly. I am not sure this has been planned in the design. What would probably happen is that Egyptian blockchains would be considered bogus and rejected by the network. All the transactions that happened in Egypt during the blackout would be cancelled. 
This would give an incentive for a fork, and also for a correct merging. Miners would have to give up their rewards, but in theory, transactions could be merged back into the main blockchain if they were not double-spent.

One difference is that when the government prints money, it arrives in the government's budget (well not exactly, but they have a big amount of control over it). 
Another one is that, if the time is appropriate, you can decide to create more money or to create less. It gives you a control over inflation and deflation. 
The ability of printing money allows a government to easily inject money into the economy. Some economists, including Krugman, argue that this key capacity is what many EU countries are lacking right now and that this is a crucial element of the current crisis.

I understand that it is hard and maybe not interesting for a client to spend 2 hours understanding what may at first sound like a scam of dubious legality. I don't blame them for not doing the effort.
I am merely pointing out that even among geeks, the use of bitcoins is not really widespread.

That's a valid question, but quite unrelated with the issue at hand. A gender group is not an interest group. I agree that interests of women tend to have remarkable differences with interests of men, but this difference is often really blurry. You have or don't have interest in SF. "Men's stuff" and "Women's stuff" are so broad categories that most people have interest in both. 


That one is easy : physical distance makes that I can neither use nor help any projects physically located there. But women happen to live everywhere (actually I suspect there is one living in my flat), to make projects everywhere, to interact with men quite often.


The only occasion I can see where this would happen is when discussing sex and relationship with women. I would see that as shocking segregation if it was on any other subject.
Actually, I am sorry if I look like I take this too much at heart, but this is pet peeve I have a lot lately : a lot of cultural instincts prevent men-women collaboration on a huge amount of interesting projects. I think it is worthwhile to fight these temptations to segregate. I find it especially exasperating to see that the same dynamics could occur online, where the excuse of harassment makes a lot less sense.


But if these 10% of people move away from the bitcoin reddit and put their contributions somewhere else, you will have managed to achieve gender segregation in the bitcoin community.


I didn't have this feeling so I read the first few pages of comments. Really, do it, there is something wrong in your perception. You attract some criticism, but almost exclusively from women. Maybe you received some sexist shit, but it was apparently downvoted into oblivion.

I do believe that you really need 66% of the network to begin to do some nasty things. And even in that case, some people may decide to fork the blockchain at some point rather that let this attacker control the whole thing.
But yeah, the idea is to prevent a very small clique from having an overly exaggerated power, like what happened in Cyprus : remove 7% from every bank account.
And yes, if you are alone against the whole world, bitcoin won't save you anyway, you should better stockpile gold (and guns).

In my country, most people have a secure computer in their pocket. It is called a smartcard. It is not powerful enough to run a bitcoin node, and of course not a mining rig, but it is enough to sign transactions and to keep a secret key private.

1) I see. But why does this feminine contribution has to take the form of a separate group? I don't pinterest and I don't facebook either, but I would be interested in helping bitcoin spread on these two fronts. You are interested in bitcoin, something that (apparently?) interests about 90% of males, you are the proof that a gender-imbalanced interest still attracts interesting contributions from the other gender.
Sure, I won't be over-interested in a knitting community using bitcoin, but it has its place on as much as, for instance, a car-modding community using bitcoin, another thing I am not overly interested in. But it is good to know that both these things exist.
2) Well, I have observed the dynamics, but I do think that a lot of these perceptions are flawed. Women solidarity is not always the norm, is often a hassle to women who know how to deal with creeps by themselves, and a group of women *will* attract creeps.

Ok, I kind of like Krugman, but am not a big fan, however I dislike dishonest arguments. These two claims are dishonest. Here we go.
**Bitcoin, stupid?** Go to the [source]( and try to find "stupid" in this article. He criticizes a fact that we all know : that no monetary policy can be applied on the bitcoin economy. He is optimistic toward monetary policies : he think that people who decide them can do better than a monkey randomly making decisions. We make the oposite bet. It is all a matter of opinion. He argues that the value of bitcoins in dollars is not the most interesting metric to see the success of BTC as a currency and he is right : right now this is more of a refugee value. 
I do hope that this will change as BTC become more popular, but the fact remains that despite proposing BTC payment to all of my clients, none accepted it yet.
**internet no more important than fax machines** : In a list of predictions, he made a half-false one. You have to remember that during this time, it was the dotcom bubble. People were thinking the singularity was around the corner, that 90% of the GNP would be done through websites. People with a clue (either technical or economical) knew that these trends were a bubble. His prediction was :
"By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's."
It was wrong. Internet had a bigger impact, but much smaller than the people he is answering too thought it would have. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:23:45
I'll restate something that has actually been stated by critics of bitcoins but that is actually a valid argument: the success of bitcoin is not measured by its exchange rate with the dollar. The success of bitcoin as a currency is measured by the volume of goods exchanged in actual transactions.
If 90% of the transactions are made in exchange of actual goods or services at a 0.1$/BTC, it is a success. If the rate is 1000$/BTC but 99.99% of the transactions occur on currency exchanges, it is not.
@_date: 2013-02-08 13:45:24
This discussion has been done a lot in various forms. You can find definitions of money that fit bitcoins, you can find definitions that don't. The fact is, there are people that accept BTCs as payment, you can easily transform BTCs to dollars or euros at a known rate, and it is be hard to find a seller that won't accept bitcoin as a payement if you propose to pay a high enough price.
You can add all the constraints you want to your definition, bitcoin is what it is : a liquid digital and decentralized asset.

The "supposedly fixed supply" does not rely on trust of a central issuing authority.
Common sense dictates that there has to be some authority, somewhere, and to someone who says "no there isn't" it is reasonable to answer that it must be hidden, but it must be there.
Actually, it does take some understanding of hashing and mining to understand that, indeed, there is no central authority in bitcoin. Some people say that the maintainers of bitcoind would have such an authority, but in fact, it is a very far fetched claim.
There has been so many bogus virtual currencies that I can't blame this guy for suspecting it is another pyramid scheme. I hope that seeing Bill Gates, which one can assume knows a bit about both tech and business, finding it interesting will make him reconsider it.

The first time I examined bitcoin algorithm, I also found it very wasteful and inelegant. This is true, this is almost as wasteful as minting metal coins, and the electricity wasted on the bitcoin network is a bit sad. 
However, you have to see that it does something that no other network does : it creates a substitute for trust, or for the assurance that a single person does not create multiple identities without relying on a central authority.

I2P is a darknet. It means that this network uses internet to communicate between points but that it provides a supplemental layer that provides anonymity. It is similar to Tor in a way.
I don't know exactly the project linked but my understanding is that it is a fork of the bitcoin client, but not of the blockchain, that allows people to use it over I2P.

That's what they call incoherent policies.
There is one things that is coherent to do when a private bank is too big to fail and failing nonetheless : nationalization. Buy underpriced stocks and make the government the majority shareholder.
But again, nationalization, despite being a perfectly valid tool, used in the past by various government from all the political spectrum, is seen as an avatar of communism.

Or they bought a bunch of coins and are banking out on the 30$ bump :)

I mined 50 BTCs in the old times, I tsold at the 30$ peak. I used to think people who bought then were dumb. Well played, sir.
I still kept 6 BTC "to see where it goes". It goes incredibely high...

Depends on how greedy he is. Who do you think owns the largest stash of early mined bitcoins? Someone has 400 000 of them.

I am not a DNA specialist, but I know that one step in finding DNA traces is using a specific protein (DNA polymerases?) in order to duplicate the DNA and give it a chance to be detected. Therefore, "fresh" samples would be easy to produce.
I personally particularily dislike DNA procedures because I have a (pretty common) skin condition that makes me leave a lot of DNA traces wherever I go. If someone were to spread some polymerase in a street I walked in, it is likely that my DNA would show up.
I just wish that nobody ever gets raped in a taxi I just took.

I doubt it is a Japanese person, but I must admit that the fact that MtGox is in Japan is troubling.
It could be a lone programmer or a small group, I am not sure on either way.

If it costs 10$ to have a secure smartcard, I don't mind buying a new one for every crypto currency I want to use.
@_date: 2013-02-11 12:10:24
Ok, I don't know how the difficulty increases. This might indeed be a problem.

Crypto-nerds are using smartcards now for this exact reason. We were talking at the local hackerspace about how one could keep an encrypted partition secure in China, assuming we could be constantly spied, stealthily filmed, that someone could visit our room during the night to install malware, etc...
The answer is that you need a smartcard, that you *never* leave.

Actually DNA identification would be less secure than most of the things proposed already. Getting DNA samples from a person is incredibly easy. 
One important thing to understand is that these authentication means have all an essential weakness : they rely on an information that can be duplicated. Consider the following scenario : you have two institutions, A and B, you need to authenticate to. A is a scam and B is legitimate. If you use fingerprint scanning for both, A will now your pattern and will be able to duplicate it to authenticate as you.
There is only one way to prevent this kind of attack : cryptographic challenge-responses. In this scenario, you register to the institutions with a public key, and every time you need to authenticate yourself, you sign a message from the institution. Preferably one that is timestamped and signed by the institution itself (this latter part prevents man in the middle attacks)
Biometric authentication offer a false sense of security. Because they rely on obscure and expensive pieces of equipment, they are considered secure, but actually most of them can be bypassed by any competent organization.
I would rather prefer to implant a crypto-chip that offer a challenge-response mechanism than rely on biometrics to authenticate anywhere.

If you want fast trading because you think BTC is just about speculation, don't use MtGox. Their servers being unavailable during peak volumes has happened before and will happen again.

1. People implement bitcoin payments
2. People begin receiving bitcoins and stockpiling them and spending them for other stuff via paypal
3. People slowly realize that they can get 1% more money from removing paypal altogether.
