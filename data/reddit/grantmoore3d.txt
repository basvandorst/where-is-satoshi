This is the first Bitcoin joke that actually made me laugh out loud. Usually I'm amused by the memes but this was spot on clever humor.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:36:55
I'm trying, but the exchange I use is not currently accepting the only method of fiat funding I have access to. Pretty annoying. Considering getting cash and hitting a local BTC ATM despite the high fees.

I have a friend who has put thousands of dollars into Kiva loans and says the success rate is extremely good. He mostly does it for altruistic reasons, but I think you've hit a very interesting use for Bitcoin. If someone could build a Kiva equivalent, it could technically reach anyone (assuming local currency could be traded for BTC).

I don't view Bitcoin as a currency anymore, instead I feels it's becoming a public ledger specifically for a store of value. As an aside, it's also valuable as an entry-point into other cryptos which are better suited for other tasks. That said, it doesn't have to be this way with improvements like you are suggesting.

Just to be clear, would every BTC purchase be tracked "independently" to be able to calculate this?
1 BTC @ $100 USD ... now $10k sell, pay taxes on the gain of 1 BTC
0.2 BTC @ $1000 USD ... now $10k sell, pay taxes on gain of 0.2 BTC
I can't think of any other way to figure out what you'd owe other than to treat it like buying a share in a stock or something. Does it work that way in practice?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:41:13
Maybe people could pool resources to do a purchase together?
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:26:53
I honestly disagree, I think Bitcoin is going to be a store of value and a method for transferring large sums of wealth, whether it's a direct BTC purchase or simply using BTC as the intermediary transmission method. I don't see, long term, people running around doing their shopping with Bitcoin. It's more of a new asset class and it's value is in it's reliability to store value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:17:01
Now here's the tricky question...
1 BTC purchased for $1000 USD
1 BTC purchased for $10,000 USD
I sell 0.5 BTC a year later for $10,000 USD... how do you measure that? It's not like you're forced to buy/sell a "share" of Bitcoin where you can measure the increment equally. Do I put that sale towards the $1000 purchase or the $10,000 purchase? What are the rules for claiming gains? Would I just say "oh yeah, I'm selling the $10k purchased bitcoin and half of that doubled in value" to minimize taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:00:14
Thanks for confirming!
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:28:08
Wouldn't safe deposit boxes be an exception? Basically you're paying the bank to keep whatever you decide to put in that box secure, it doesn't necessarily have to be money.

Also, I must admit, I do feel the whole "inflation &amp; perpetual growth" concepts our economies are built on simply have to stop at some point. Global population still has room to grow, but eventually, we'll be at max capacity for the planet, so our financial structure will need to change to promote stability rather than growth.
I guess I'm just a bit pessimistic that we'll actually get there, versus completely annihilating each other :P
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:29:11
Oh totally, trust that I believe the technology is a potential solution for just that. I simply feel mass adoption is a bit far fetched without massive difficulty forcing adoption like you have described.

You last sentence sounds wonderful, let's hope you're right and I'm wrong!
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:42:56
I believe Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) has a very bright future, but this claim is a stretch, even for this sub. Realistically, it will be a widely adopted asset class alongside national currencies for storing and transferring wealth easily. Every day currency where you'll never touch a dollar? Not likely.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:36:03
I'd be buying if the Canadian exchanges weren't so shit at accepting transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:25:56
When you tap those cards you're using dollars though? I guess maybe I misunderstood the comment I replied to. The difference in technological leap for end user is small as you've stated. However the trust in the system and government adoption of the technology is a large leap. Also, Bitcoin has a long way to becoming scalable at that volume of transactions (I know it's a work in progress / future thing that might not be an issue)
@_date: 2015-02-08 20:37:59
Call me crazy, but if civilization managed to make it to Mars with a sustainable colony, I sincerely hope we have devised a better system to live by than what we currently have now (profit motivation, money, etc...).

None the less, this is a hilarious aspect of Bitcoin that I had never considered. Very interesting.

An easy to use web package that allows me to receive bitcoin payments without having to use a merchant service like bitpay. Automatic btc adjustment based on current price, custom fields for email and mailing address and receiving addresses generated on the fly which get put into my own specific address. Payment service online already have these things but I don't want to pay their fees for something that could be free or minimally licensed.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:05:44
I'll have to give that a try. Though while I could probably figure it out because I've done PHP and know a little bit about web development, I guess what I was hoping was for something as simple as... say... a Wordpress plugin that you just turn on, add a few products and give it an address.
Though thanks for mentioning that, I personally like tinkering with code so I'll probably end up rolling out my own solution anyways.
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:45:12
Exactly, there will eventually be services specifically designed to be a "safe" middle-man. Of course, it will cost more but if you're concerned with making a purchase it could be worth it and I see nothing wrong with those kinds of protections for a fee.
The only difference here is that it would be voluntary, instead of a forced system everyone must go through.

Obviously the only logical solution is to roll die to produce your own hex values and therefore a truly randomly generated key.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:57:46
I think the point the OP is making is that if you wanted X item for $100, why not see if it's available in BTC instead and just pay through that to help the current adoption grow. Basically, buy things you would have anyways using BTC and you're not losing anything.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:35:38
You guys kind of disappoint me. Every other single company that has announced they are accepting Bitcoin, you trumpet and applaud their valiant efforts... yet because it's this console that some of you don't like and/or understand, you just complain. Kind of pathetic attitude going on in here.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:48:21
Yes, but you're thinking too much from an American perspective and not global. If Bitcoin dominated the online markets as the "online currency" there wouldn't be any restrictions to where you could spend your money or who could accept it. Of course, it's more complicated than that, but I'm just simplifying the idea.

I know there is going to be a wave of these QR code signs since that story broke out about the $24k donations received to that one guy, but this is going to get lame really quick. What I would suggest, if you plan to hold up a sign, is to at least try and make it about awareness. Saying something short and clever and have an easy to remember URL to information about Bitcoin. "Bitcoin, stop paying fees online. &lt;URL Shortened Link&gt;" with a QR code. At least do some work for your free tips.

Help &gt; Debug Window &gt; Console
Type the following commands
     walletpassphrase &lt;Your Pass Phrase&gt; 60
This will basically log you in with your password for 60 seconds, so the next command will work.
     dumpprivkey &lt;Your Bitcoin Address&gt;
It will then give you the private key. Just be extra careful with what you do with this private key, but you should be able to use both the address and this key to switch wallet software if you'd like.

@_date: 2013-04-25 01:14:10
To be fair, I think part of the blame could be placed on LibertyBit's buy/sell suggestions. Whenever you open up either option it's skewed towards automatically increasing the value.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:14:27
It all depends how much Bitcoin you are holding and how secure you want it to be. If I had, let's say, $100,000 worth... you better believe I'd be getting them stamped into metal, multiple copies and stored in two locations in a safe.

I don't really care if it becomes adopted as a currency or not, I'm just in it to make some money off the rise. However, the success of this as an investment will completely rely on people adopting it long term, so in a way, anyone involved has the same stake, just from different perspectives.

@_date: 2013-12-13 04:57:09
Probably not a popular opinion, but I'm completely fine with PayPal adopting Bitcoin in the future if they choose to. In my mind it would give Bitcoin  legitimacy in the eyes of a lot of people while still allowing for the tech people to use it sans fee (and make competing services)

The fact that Bitcoin doesn't have a military or government with it means it's all the more beautiful a solution. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:50:34
I was thinking just what you've described. However, what I do not understand is this (might seem stupid but I'm new to Bitcoins):
I have an address, a key for that address and a wallet DAT file. If I make sure to have the address/key combo written down, can I enter that into a future clean installation and have it pick up how many bitcoins I have automatically or do I absolutely need that DAT file?
I'm thinking of pulling the relevant data off the computer completely if possible (paper wallet) and then creating a USB-bootable Linux with a clean Bitcoin client to act as my "saving" account. Does that make sense?

Why can't it be both? It's a protocol that allows for a specific method of tendering units between addresses, and those units have real world value. You can't really have one without the other with Bitcoin

Holy shit. I can say with 100% certainty that I would not have done that.

Instead of asking you to work on my website, how about I ask for a component which can be easily dropped onto any website who needs this similar functionality.
I'm working on an indie game prototype right now and am starting to put together the basics for a self-managed donation campaign to fund the game using bitcoins (very much like Kickstarter, but independent). To make this work I need two things:
- A button to donate funds to my address. The easier this can be done the better. Ideally this would automagically integrate with existing payment gateways, such as PayPal, but the end result would be bitcoins. No idea if that's possible.
- Some piece of code which tracks how much value is in an address. Basically just polls my donation address for it's current value, compares against a user-specified value (in my case, I could use the average mtgox CAD value) and then display how much of the goal has been achieved. The reason I'd want it displaying in CAD is because most people visiting the website would understand that better. Though, I suppose the "goal" target could change to reflect my desired funding value instead.
Anyhow, that's my idea, it would be fantastic if you could built a template that has this kind of functionality and made it available for whoever wants to use it and customize it. I think this could be something would seriously help push the adoption of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:04:47
Do you own an OUYA and have you booted it up in the past 4 months? The games are not crappy phone ports, that's a misconception often perpetuated by people who haven't given it a second chance since a day after they launched. There are many games released, some of which are exclusive, that are true console games (albeit tailored for low powered hardware of course). The "joke" is the elitist attitudes among gamers that scoff at the library without actually giving it a fair chance. Why can't people just accept that this console exists and there are a great number of people who enjoy playing the games that it offers?
Now, if you do own one and have tried many of the games and still aren't satisfied, that's a fair position, but I would personally disagree.

Reading your reply, I suppose now that I think about it, the transfer is about as fast as any other bank-to-bank process would be.

Awesome, I was hoping someone would put together a website like this. I'm working on a prototype indie game / concept and want to try and raise enough funds that I could develop it full time. However, KS and IndieGoGo are quite limiting and charge a lot, so I was debating giving the Bitcoin market a try and now you've helped build that platform.
I'm still working on a more impressive update and my marketing pitch / materials, but if anyone is curious you can find my game (and a donation address) on the official website here:
I'll create a campaign on your website in a week or two once I'm better prepared :)

I've actually been toying with the idea of starting a business which provides people with metal engraved bitcoin addresses. The only problem with it is security. I could rig up a computer to automatically generate keys (using bitcoinaddress.org's latest repo) and get it to print out on whatever hardware I buy.
But I'd still have to manually pick them up by hand and put them into a sealed envelope and I'm sure that would turn off a lot of security-conscious people. I would never compromise the customer's keys but it would be a tough sell to this crowd to trust me, a random guy on the internet, with their private keys.

I'm going to take a wild guess that it's all the panic sellers who, for some reason, think China's ruling is a bad thing for Bitcoin when in reality, it's actually quite good.

One thing I don't understand about the paper wallet is how do you transfer the amount from it to another address when you want to?

Personally, I'd love to see [OUYA]( start accepting Bitcoin for the sale of their consoles and game credits. The company has been built around the idea of independence from the status quo and I think if they were to adopt this new technology, it would go a long way to supporting that ideal.
*Shameless Plug* : I've got a [BitcoinStarter Campaign]( running for a game project I intend to bring to the console in addition to PC, MAC &amp; Linux.

This is only speculation, but I would say there has been a large surge of big players starting to adopt the technology. For example, Shopify now allows all of their customers (something like 50,000+ storefronts) to accept Bitcoin through BitPay if they choose to. Decisions like that lend a certain level of confidence to the technolgy and make it more likely for someone to purchase it.
There are plenty of other reasons, but that my 2 cents... or 2 microBTC? Not sure how the conversion on that!

No, I doubt anyone would even understand what I gave them. Though, it could be one of those "bought stock in Apple in the early days and gave it to my kid" kind of stories... maybe I'll consider doing that on stamped metal.
