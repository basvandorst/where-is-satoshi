It's interesting that UK media are rather negative about BTC. It gives time to buy more at lower price. 
Imagine what will happen when big brands will use it as preferred method of payment. BTC is cheap now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:47:51
Good question. I also wonder if this makes any difference or can cause problems in a long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:45:12
Whatever people want to use. 
Does bch has no fees?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:44:10
It will be available to all in few weeks apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:38:09
There is also a new technology coming that won't have scalability problems, transaction fees or waiting time. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:59:23
Many people including myself use Revolut. Free transfers and free conversions between currencies.
The only downside is that you need to make two transfers and wait longer. The bright side is that you can avoid fees if doing your bank - &gt;revolut - &gt; coinbase - &gt;gdax trick transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:58:05
You get confirmation instantly. The transaction is finalised in few minutes.
If you transfer $$$ you may wait few days. Look how long you need to wait if you transfer money to coinbase. Check you bank account and how many transactions are pending. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:24:30

Brilliant 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:43:27
Maybe somebody withdraw bitcoin and was waiting for confirmation? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:45:39
It can be good for crypto if true. People will be looking for ways to spend crypto without exchanging to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:55:17
Maybe but people expect there will be a huge dip at some point as shorting is expected.

Info Wars talks surprisingly well about bitcoin for some while already. Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:30:33
I also believe that it's in very rich people interest to undermine bitcoin. It's a real threat to big corporations, government and central banks.
Journalists make little money and its very easy and cheap to order specific views. 
Be prepared for even more attacks. Many of them will be totally fake and paid for. Some will be genuine. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:37:31
There is very fiew coins that are more expensive and slower than bch.
Litecoin, dogecoin, ripple and many more have lower fees and are faster. There are also new coins with new technology that are free and instant. 
Bitcoin has more room to improve as its open to LN and Segwit when bch will do what? Make blocks 1GB?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:08:32
Sticky that, please!!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:41:58
Litecoin works even better. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:07:11
There are some people who converted most their money to btc.
This way they are better spending btc sometimes than keeping fiat and never have gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:57:59
You spend to make bitcoin popular.
If you spend $10 on pizza it make almost no difference
. You could buy more bitcoin for the money. 
In a way it's better to spend btc as it's gaining value than keeping $$$ and loosing value.
Some people prefer to convert all fiat they've got and then spend btc when they need it.

Linux is open source and with a LOT of experienced devs but also a lot of arrogance. A lot of things doesn't work as it should for ages. 
The only distro that gained some popularity is semi commercial Ubuntu. If people have problems with the system it's people's fault. 
It's a niche product and definitely not for everybody. 
The idea of open source sounds great but often leads to very slow development.
Apple was first to use GUI invented by Xerox. Bill liked this idea while working with Apple and did the same. First Windows wasn't very good nor stable but it become very successful due to more efficient business practices.
Big open source projects tends to move very slowly and it's very hard to get any consensus.

It doesn't answer the question.
I also wonder what would be tx fee for other coins if they had the same market cap and transaction volume. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:28:13
Coinbase refuses to implement any upgrades. That causes pending problems and panic sell.
Lightcoin is up partly because it's the easiest way to take money out from coinbase. 
I try to calm myself as I made 50% from November anyway.
In my opinion it's good time to buy and try different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:28
What about Dash? I've heard Dash and Monero are anonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:22:16
1% sounds low. Isn't coinbase charge 4%?

I have no idea and I wonder myself. It probably alsp depends of the country.
I have a small business in UK and I don't understand how I would pay taxes if 100% of my income is in btc and I spend all of it without exchanging? 
Would I need to pay in btc or I would I be forced to exchange part of it to pay taxes? 
Also a disclaimer: I pay all my taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:22:22
I think the number is small considering that most users are in Asia.
I don't think it's more than 2%.

What if DAG technology prove to work and offer scalability and lower fees than PayPal and Visa?
Also if some new project bring completely new technology that works can Bitcoin implement that as a second layer?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:38:27
If you invest in alt then consider something, that bitcoin doesn't offer and probably won't offer - like annonimity. 
Speed and fees can change with potential future updates.

People invest in bitcoin because they believe it can be improved.
Many popular altcoins are just versions of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:45
How did they solved all the problems? 
Can Bitcoin become free to use as well?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:26:49
My guess
More media coverage
Lightning layer to speed up BTC
Bigger faith in BTC
Maybe some big players joining
Increased difficulty of mining.
Very high price in South Korea

ATM in UK has £500 limit per transaction for unregistered users. However you can make two or more transactions of £500 without problems.
It's not only anonymous but also the quickest way to buy coins and altcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:12:04
The problem for me is I don't know who to believe as I have not enough knowledge. 
Real Bitcoin supporters says that big blocks aren't good solution. Bcash supporters say it's a myth and it's working just fine. 
As an inexperienced average guy I see real Bitcoin to be 10 000 more expensive to use. It's painful and I start to wonder who is right/who is wrong/who is deliberately lying. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:59:03
I really don't like how he acts. Rude and arrogant. 
Unfortunately he also seems to be a great businessman and he makes things done. 
Bcash transfer cost is $0.0015. BTC costs like 10 000 more to transfer. It's painful to admit but BCH is probably the most usable digital currency at the moment - cheap and popular.
If he keep doing what he is doing and deliver right now he may be a threat to real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:47:35
I'm full in RaiBlocks. My wife keeps Bitcoin.
I know DAG technology and 0 fees is the future. However some smart people suggest that you can force this technology on Bitcoin as well. It won't be the best solution but it can work.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:15:26
I agree. Inthink both coins need eaxh other. Litecoin can be a test ground so bitcoin can safely move forward/up.

I wouldn't mind to use a free one for grocery shopping. Can top up a free coin wallet with £20 I guess.
Otherwise I probably stick to bitcoin as it seems to be a sure thing.
Is there a chance for bitcoin to become free to use? Or free to use is a scam? Seems to good to be true.

That's one of the dangers of cryptos today - you can very easily lose all the money by making a small mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:19:21
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:28:53
It must be easy to use so for cheaper transactions it probably would be Etherum or Litecoin at this moment.
There is also a chance that some major updates will make it BTC easier to use or currencies like Iota with no fees will be easier to buy.
The market is very flexible so there is really no problem changing to any crypto at any time. Whatever works best at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:43:44
There are already much better (low fee, faster) coins on the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:14:29
Does it mean that speed of transaction issue is almost solved?
Can somebody explain this, please?

People are busy preparing 20K ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:13:02
The situation is different now. Bitcoin dominates the market by a huge margin. Even if competition is a scam it highlights a real problem of bitcoin. 
I hope bitcoin will be improved and the pressure will speed up the process.

@_date: 2017-12-25 12:52:42
It's not only that but you also need to top up the channel like a prepayment card. In real life it can cost even few hundred $$$$ to open a channel that you plan to use consistently.

If the intentions were honest they would start using one that already exists.
If they plan to make one then I'm sure it would be unlimited one where only government could make more and in an easy way. Same as fiat.  Shit coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:18:11
Same here. Waiting for a card to use bitcoin in every shop.
I hope Revolut will have good exchange rate, then I will convert most of my savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:03:04
It can be stressful to constantly check the price. I decided to relax to avoid panic sell. I will HODL and enjoy live with my family. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:19:19

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:11:16
Unfortunately BTC is waiting for upgrade to speed up and lower the cost of transfers. At this moment people often use other popular coins to actually pay for stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:06:55
What makes it even more weird is that gdax doesn't have Segwit and in general send money in the most expensive way. I don't get why they do that? 
To keep the world dominance maybe?

I don't see how they want naked short Bitcoin. It just seems crazy. How they deliver the coins? If they buy later it will drive price sky high. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:48:51
That's what community blame them for. Especially for not implementing Segwit for such a long time. 
I'm not an expert but I wonder why they haven't done it yet.

It's not Coinbase fee - it's Bitcoin miners fee. 
As many mentioned before you can transfer from Coinbase to Gdax instantly for free (same company) and from gdax to any wallet also for free. This trick saved me tons of money recently.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:16:21
It's not easy because recently there is huge problem with very high fees and few days transfer time of BTC.
When this problem will be solved there will be very little difference in price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:14:07
I think it's not considered a gain until you convert to fiat.

@_date: 2017-12-04 13:43:43
Check other interviews on youtube. Learn difficult questions and how to answer them. Train. Record yourself to improve your delivery of your message.
My guess of potential questions. 
- what is bitcoin/crypto currency /blockchain
- is it a bubble? 
- is it to late to invest 
- can you use it as money? 
- how popular as money or investment is it? 
- is it save to use it? Do criminals use it? 
- why it's illegal in China and Venezuela? 
- why Japan is so into bitcoin
- what are your prediction for future? 
- can it be a danger to government and banking system? 
I hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:12
In UK many people use Revolut to exchange GBP to Euro and then send it to Coinbase.
It's considered the best way to make bigger trades. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:59:28
Most people suggest keeping funds on an exchange isn't secure.
It's very convenient however.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:06:41
Is bitcoin able to implement DAG what isn't just normal blockchain?
I have some doubts about LN and would prefer something build in that doesn't complicate life for a noob like me.

From what I know you pay to open a channel and you need to top up the channel to use it. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:47:48
You can split into more smaller transactions and or use different ATM.
If this won't work just make more wallets and merge them together after buy if you wish. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:15
BCH is slow and expensive. Unsuitable for microtransactions and it's not scalable.
Bitcoin is more expensive and slower but has potential to improve. Bcash hasn't. 
There are plenty cheaper (even with no transaction costs) and faster altcoins. BCH is really rubbish and pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:26
I think shorting will create nice dips/discounts for buyers. For those who want to keep it long term is good news.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:02:55
I like Litecoin a lot and it's one of the best coins to transfer to exchanges right now. 
It can change however if ripple will appear on coinbase as it's much faster and with lower tx fee. Centralisation doesn't matter if it's just a tool to transfer value.
There is also new generation of crypto with no fees at all. If they prove to work as promised they will revolutionise the crypto market.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:53:11

Lots of negative comments but it has some use.
You can convert your payslips to btc and use paying card to do shopping when needed. Revolut will exchange crypto to fiat on the fly when paying. This way your money are growing on your account. It's not real btc but grow is real. Whatever you earn you can send to coinbase and buy real bitcoin.
It can be a very useful tool to make extra money for real bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:07:03
I hope not and when they do it will be to late. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:25:44
All ATMs in London I've seen are cash only. You can put any amount you like. If there is a limit just split into two transactions.
Even with card only machines there is always a way around. Just pay/ask somebody to do it for you.
If there will be a bigger need to hide the transactions people will find more solutions.

I Hodl about 10% of bitcoin there. 
I think it's also very convenient way to convert your payslips to BTC and pay in shops using their mastercard. It will convert to fiat on the fly while paying.

I understand and agree with you. 
I'm just saying it's probably not easy enough for my mom to use it at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:15:13
It's not real bitcoin wallet but it can make huge difference for crypto.
Even people without savings can exchange theirs payslips to bitcoin and use Revolut paying card for everyday live. 
If it will work as other cards it will exchange btc to your local currency for free when using the card.
It will also make withdrawals very easy. 
I've got the card already. Can't wait for the upgrade. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:47:37

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:29
Not as direct as it has now. The market cap dominance isn't as big as it used to be and new projects aren't Bitcoin based or even use standard blockchain. 
Not sure how it will work out for our gains from Bitcoin but in general it will be good for the technological improvement and for the world.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:04:53
I know but it still doesn't tell what would be the cost if other coins would be at exact spot where btc is right now.
Unless I don't understand something. Are you able to tell what would be avarage teansaction cost for BCH, LTC ETH, DOGE if they had the same market cap and tx volume?  
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:51:38
It really doesn't matter to me at this point. I have only 10% of my savings there. My wife has bigger chunk there. 
I was using Revolut to transfer money in Euro to Coinbase anyway. Now I decided to park some money there in BTC and see how it works. Low fees make it grow faster than on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:43:24
I think there is a huge difference if you can buy a coin using fiat money. Also a high fee makes it impossible to use for microtransaction. 
At this point Lite coin seems to be default option as it's not expensive and you can buy in on coinbase.

There is small hidden fee in the BTC price. There is a trick to avoid this fee however. Youtube has answers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:03:01
This as a VERY good question. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:17:50
Good one :) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:05:54
RaiBlocks and Iota. Iota is slower. Rai is nearly instant. 
I'm sure there will be plenty more coins based on that scalable technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:08:06
They don't need. I just hope.
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:42:20
I haven't bought anything using BTC yet but when buying Bitcoing using ATM machine the money was instantly on my coinbase account.
Not sure how it works exactly but seems to work well in Japan for example.

No Alex Jones in the video.

If you exchange all your money to bitcoin and then buy something using bitcoin you are have more than if you don't buy btc at all and have fiat money that is losing value every day.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:00:22
As soon as I will be able to pay for bills I will be replacing almost all my fiat money. Even if I spend BTC is still much better than keeping fiat in wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:00:06
All altcoins price is in BTC and then calculated to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:53:05
It doesn't matter if they short it. In long term it means extra fiat money poured into bitcoin.
People are losing tons of money trying to short Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:02
I hope the LN network is coming soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:28
Etoro doesn't sell Bitcoin. You just bet on price.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:41:16
He could have made millions but he lost faith in Bitcoin as currency.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:49:50
I use one like this in London. They are getting very popular here.
The fee is higher but is instant and no ID required. Easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:10:43
Litecoin is better because Charlie Lee is a better person than Roger Vier. 
Litecoin is open for upgrades when BCash pretends it sorted scalability problem. 
Also Litecoin has waaaay more transactions than bcash while still being cheaper and with plans to reduce fees even further. 
Bcash future doesn't look good.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:56:10
Don't do it. Fees will eat your earnings. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:18:09
Me and my wife have some BTC on Revolut. it's OK to have some to HODL in my opinion. 
Revolut offers low fees and low price on BTC and cheapest way to buy a whole BTC in one go. 
Yes, it's cheaper to sell but it doesn't matter if you buy cheap. For every ££ or $$ you put there you probably earn more than on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:36:31
I'm based in UK and it's fine here. Not perfect but OK. We even have ATM machines with withdrawal option. I was just curious why in some countries the law/rules are so weird.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:35
If she is smart she wouldn't like an idiot who spents all his savings for a trip. Marry her and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:00:52
I consider having it displayed on my flat screen all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:51:23
There are new coins with 0 fees and instant transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:45:55
Very interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:52:01
Wow. He deserves it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:24:23
I'm not saying big blocks are bad or segwit is good. I have no idea. 
I only say BCH fees are getting high and it's not as fast as competitors. Top recorded average fee for BCH so far is $0.6. With higher popularity it can easily reach few $$$. It's a dead end.
Again: There are some new coins that are already with 0 fees and promise to be scalable.
 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:28:39
I work harder to convert more fiat to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:12:49
I don't invest in bch partly because of content in r/btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:45:10
My wife doubled her investment today at just above £10 000. It was still more expensive than when she bought few weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:46:30
Same feeling here. Negativity on both forums put me off. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:53:26
We just need any altcoin with noticable lower fees and tx time on coinbase. I think ripple can kill bcash while not being a direct competition to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:33:35
It's kind of against left political view I think. Bitcoin can limit the role of government and make people more independent. 
Some people prefer to be depended and that somebody will take care for them.   
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:26:13
I went for coinbase.com. Probably the easiest and with low fees.
After some time you can start looking for more advanced ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:47:57
Hacking the system? Producing more coin over 21M maybe?
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:42:07
Bitcoin can still adapt any technology that proof to be working.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:27:59
My guess is that either banks burnt damaged/old notes or stopped printing for a while and let some notes to disappear from the market naturally (damaged, lost, destroyed etc.).
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:47:05
Looks like real exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:55
People are afraid it's too good to be true. 
Investing all when all you've got is 1 payslip is easy. 
It's much different when you put 10years savings for a house or children's education.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:02
Are you aware how complicated, slow and expensive is to set up a channel?
Yeah, after all the efford you can pay for a coffee. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:12
Additional question regarding the first point:
How exactly the process of starting a channel works? Is it a website or it will be integrated into a wallet? How long does it take? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:28:46
We don't know what would happen to Litecoin - we assume no upgrades would be done. Litecoin is Lightning Network ready and is more open for upgrades in general.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:53
I'm worried as well. Even as a store of value it's rather expensive to move it. It's like paying for sending real gold and the problem may get worse with more transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:37:50
Iota and RaiBlocks found a solution. I'm sure there will be many more crypto like that in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:50:13
It's easy to spend btc anywhere with paying cards. I can't wait for Revolut card with good exchange ratio. Then I can go 90% bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:40:33
No, I don't. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:05:57
Most people use and recommend Coinbase/Gdax/Revolut trick for buying and for withdrawals. 
It's two transfers long but easiest and cheapest known to the community. Check @_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:38
Pay the loans. Even if BTC will go up it isn't worth to lie.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:27:55
Devs kept 5%. All the rest was manually mined by solving captcha. Venezuela is where big part of coins went. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:13:05
We all regret. I regret a wasn't faster. I had a plan and I knew it will grow up. Still didn't use mlst of my investment money. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:54:24
What worries me is that better technology often loses to aggressive business practices. Something like Bill Gates stealing Apple ideas and winning on inferior product.
Even if bitcoin is the best it can lose at some point if other coins will have better marketing and later more money to pay good devs. 
Bitcoin today is a mess. It's hard to buy £20 at ATM. Sending can take weeks. Can't be used in small businesses. 
We all try to look at brighter future. Future based on hope. 
I hope bitcoin won't end up like Linux. 
Disclaimer: 90% of my coins is Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:54
All coin prices are calculated by btc price. The only way for altcoin to be green is to go up faster than bitcoin correction. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:01:54
Get a bitcoin Visa or Mastercard to automaticaly convert bitcoin to fiat. This way you have 100% in BTC and convert in the last moment when you need it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:22:07
What crypto currency would you recommend for small business owners at the moment? Lite coin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:02:02
No much choice in UK. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:14:51
Bitcoin is different because people want it to work. Demand is high and will keep driving the price.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:26:42
Keep the BTC. You can buy 10 such watches later.

Hi, 
A total noob here who wants to save some money for my wife and kids. 
What easy apps would you suggest for MacOSX and Android? 
So far I've got blockchain.info but struggle with card payments limitations.
Thank you
