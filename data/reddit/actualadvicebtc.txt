lol I got screwed too... I got that address way back a year ago when I was still learning the whole bitcoin thing...Would like to think I wouldn't fall for something like this now but didn't really think much harm could come out of an unused year old address. woops theres 0.11 btc ill never see again, at least it wasn't that much
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:38:24
Its probably fud but damage is done, I think. That big sell off right after this story got circulated 2 hours ago broke the technicals and is making it look like we will resume the downtrend.
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:12:24
this is interesting. This adds little substance or veracity to the reddit post and no extra evidence. People assume the reddit post is pfud, but now that forbes posted it could become self-fullfilling? Not sure how this will impact the market if at all, but im sure its not going to drop from it.

lol mircea is awesome, I can't believe how many andreas fanboys there, especially after how much he promoted gox and neo &amp; bee MERE DAYS before their downfall (which, I would like to add, mircea warned about, MONTHS PRIOR). 
Obviously nobody is killing anyone with their barehands, sure, maybe his black humor doesn't rub people the right way. But
my god, just a few weeks ago people were posting mircea's response to the US audit of satoshidice and praising him as a hero. you guys really suck. 
Here's an original bitcoiner sticking it to the man and instead you guys are taking the side of the shill lol. And trying to raise a call to arms/witchhunt on (the most informed and non-bandwagon of places), to report him to twitter, no less! Absurd

The google translate isn't too bad this time around.
basically this happened in samut prakan (the province).
the officer's name is actually good luck (choak dee)
the warehouse manager's name is literally soda glass (gaew soda)
Manager was out with a few guards on night patrol when they noticed the smoke. By the time authorities got there it was in ruins.
Last 2 paragraphs say that the warehouse actually belongs to foreign clients who didn't check in very often, that it was probably caused by a short. I guess they're opening an investigation into who actually owns the the warehouse and if they have the right permits.
No mention of bitcoin or mining. As far as the article is concerned it was just a rented warehouse for internet stuff.
edit: it says theres a "Mr. Wood and Wang". I dont know where the wang comes from, because his name (prana ra prakoan) is probably equivalent to something like "Sylvia of the Borderlands"

Yet another post disparaging this community and promoting the virtue of spam tipping people half a cent to promote dogecoin.
By and large the people here are friendly and helpful. There are plenty of posts on the front page where someone would write out paragraphs to break it down in simple terms for beginners. I have yet to meet all the noobhaters doge is always complaining about. I feel that the only thing going for doge is its portrayal as being "mass friendly", so its really trying to claim that niche and make it a thing by contrasting itself with (and by extension, villainizing) bitcoin.
I'm sure people in dogecoin wouldn't be too excited if they got posts about swagcoin or weedcoin brigade voted on their sub all the time.
Looks like this is going to be the new trend in r/bitcoin.

Is this a joke? Did u check to see where coinmarket gets data from? It doesn't include okcoin or huobi, *the largest chinese exchange*, which makes the info slightly skewed. Besides, how can you use 24 hr volume as a metric to measure "hoarding"? Why not look at something like transactions/outstanding?
What? "hoarding" = 1-(dailyvol/marketcap) ?  If you did that to google, you would get 1-(2/400000)= 0.999995 = 99.9995% hoarding! Everyone, google stock is a ruse!

Everyone should be doing this? Right, because a hot wallet on blockchain.info is so much safer than coinbase. Just split your hot wallet holdings over several exchanges and put on 2FA like every other trader, this spreads out the risk and gives you more opportunities. Also, coinbase is a market maker not an exchange!

On the other other hand, Huobi getting serious financing from Series A funding worth 10 million USD, so I really doubt there is any shortage of money.

*to be fair, im glad doge is doing well, because screw litecoin.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:39:55
this post makes no sense at all. The only correlation you're seeing is that litecoin tends to move with bitcoin, but is slightly more volatile. The difference in volatility sure as hell isn't as big as 2.5x leverage tho. I think you are confused.
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:10:35
Thanks for quoting only half my sentence. I said it moved with Btc but is slightly more volatile. So if bitcoin moves 3% against the dollar and ltc moves 3.5%, yes it would be reflected in Btc/ltc.  
@_date: 2014-03-22 08:45:47
1. You sound like you're trying to be sarcastic but I agree completely. 
1. The too big to fail sham was Satoshi's inspiration for making bitcoin in the first place. 
1. Besides, who is going to use them if they reopen lol. It would be the ultimate ponzi scheme, because the only way they can make their money back is if gox victims convince some poor saps to deposit bitcoins. Or I guess they can charge 80% commission per trade.
You first!

A bit naive of you to think that traders don't have alerts on new r/bitcoin;weibo;twitter;sina posts to see what sorts of trouble the casuals want to get in to.

Main points:

* “We just don’t know what the outcome will be,” BTC China CEO Bobby Lee told CoinDesk. “At this stage, it’s too early for me to speculate on the options we have. We just don’t know enough right now.”
Did everyone forget how PBOC waited until Bobby Lee boarded a flight before they decided to make their december announcement public? Remember?! The one that caused the december crash? But I'm sure Bobby Lee will be the first to know this time!!

My favorites are their attempts to buy time and continue the ponzi by promising midas and ltc and giving a christmas 1 millionth user commission promotion. 
It took them almost a year and a half to fail to add litecoin. Meanwhile, BTCChina hears about huobi about to do it and beats them to the punch in just a few weeks. Gox makes me feel dirty.

Yeah this is an issue with the blockchain.info wallets. I had a friend who also had this problem. Apparently those transactions don't get on the network and its just on the blockchain.info website (try checking for those transactions on other sites like blockr.io ---&gt;edit: yeah just checked for you, that transaction never happened:  ). Thats ok though, easy enough to fix.
 
Go to your blockchain.info wallet, choose export unencrypted and copy the private key. Then import those keys into another wallet (e.g. multibit.org, since its lightweight). Let me know if this works.

Obviously you can't find out how many people use bitcoin, because because its bitcoin. You can use this as a proxy variable I guess 
Using my lazy estimation of each sample from januaries: there was 1 address in jan 2009, 180 in jan 2010, 1200 in jan 2011, 11k in jan 2012, 30k in jan 2013, 150k in jan 2014:

These comments are unbelievable. You know that potter's job is to trade on behalf of clients and funds right?? Of course this is wrong/unethical/cheating. Its not about price discovery or efficiency or markets absorbing inside knowledge about some future event. We're talking specific knowledge about orderbook mechanics which means they can use predatory tactics like stop hunting with no risk.
Anyone who has any experience with hedgefunds know that margin calls and stoplosses are extremely confidential for a reason. People comparing this knowledge with information arbitrage are ignorant.
God damn, are standards that low in crypto now?
"Oh its ok that funds are using an insider to get info on stophunting and to manipulate the market, at least it doesn't seem like they're operating as a fractional reserve yet!"
