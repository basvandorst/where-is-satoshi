I now have the bitcoin on my new phone and I want to do a backup so if I ever do this again I can recover easily.
In Mycelium I go to the Accounts screen and select the account with my bitcoin, it is the second account in the list, the first account is the HD account.  Should I do the backup from this screen or go into the account?

do I need to be on line to make the seed words? I had not done that in the past but might be able to do it on the phone now

OK, I think this is the last question:  I have done a backup where I wrote down the 12 words (saved in a safe location) and added a PIN to my account.  Can I take these same 12 words and restore on a different device and end up with a duplicate account?  So if I open Mycelium on my Nexus 7 and restore from the 12 words, will that screw anything up with the bitcoins I have on my phone?

You're telling me.  And the way I recovered it was surprising:  hold volume down and power under a bright lamp for 5 min.  That thing started breathing life and I felt like Vossler in Crimson Tide.

Thank you for this, it helped me a lot.
It would be great if we could understand the source of the majority of the non-SW transactions (assuming it does not exist now) to target this information to that group. For example, it's convenient for me to use mycelium and find someone locally to sell me Bitcoin for cash.  Since this app isn't updated for SegWit that could mean many non-SW transactions. Same thing for the exchanges people use that aren't updated.
With the growing population that is buying Bitcoin directly, this post has helped me understand the compounding problem.

Is it just as hard to sell? Since I haven't yet touched any of these elusive fuckers, I don't know what my options are for selling.

Any bits left?

I have worked with their Support and that didn't help. I had this as an open issue, placed an order, told them about it and it still failed. I see trading bitcoin like trading a stock and I wouldn't expect this service from etrade or the like. 
I have thought of local bitcoins, just trying to avoid a large markup. As for the others like circle, think I'm still waiting for invites.  Thx for the responses, many different perspectives

I think investors might be getting cash from bitcoin and using it in the traditional stock market.  The traditional market seems to have a lot of confidence now. I'm no financial guy by any means but my thought is bitcoin is one of those things like gold on a couple basic points: it's not going away and people run to it when the traditional market is shakey but come back to THE coin when scared

slight progress...
on the account I restored I have no transactions.  so I got out my old phone which had the bitcoins on it before I transferred things around.  I open that and I can see the transactions, but that wallet is at a 0 balance because I moved the coin to another wallet.
Can I use this transaction detail to figure out where my coins are?  I have 2 transactions and it was one on Apr of this year when I moved the coins to another wallet.

2 day-old reddit account.  What are you hiding from?  You post a lot so you aren't new to reddit.  Are you hiding because you are an asshole, as shown in many of your previous posts?

You can 'bet' on it -
