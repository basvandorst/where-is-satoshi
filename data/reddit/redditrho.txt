excuse the basicness of this question but,
is it safe to backup/sync my iphone to itunes or icloud if I have bitcoin wallets on it? If so what is best practice for doing this? thanks.

can you start including mempool (unconfirmed transactions) data in these updates?

If BTC price hits my target, i'll consider disappearing to this place. Are they willing to sell passports?

It turns out that my AT&amp;T cellphone service was also compromised on the same day that my comcast and Coinbase accounts were hacked. This might be how the 2fa was compromised. Someone was able to obtain at least the last four digits of my SSN and used this information to get AT&amp;T to forward calls to my cellphone number to their phone number. Since coinbase has the option for a customer to receive the 2fa code via a phone call, this may have been how the account was ultimately compromised.

My coinbase account was also robbed. Same M O: mysteriously received 2FA code by SMS to my phone when I hadn't tried logging in. Couldn't log in to my coinbase account. Reset my password to login. After logging in, I discovered my bitcoins were gone. I'm beginning to suspect someone inside coinbase may be facilitating these thefts.

beats me but the bitcoins are gone. they reset the password to my account but I still received the SMS text verification to my phone yet they were still able to access my account. I'm back in my account and I dont see any evidence that they added another phone for 2FA verification. Bizarre. Until coinbase responds to this I wont use them anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:04:37
actually I had my comcast email forward to my gmail account which is 2FA enabled so no copies of emails are supposed to be stored on my comcast account. Trying to figure out if perp stumbled accidentally upon the association of my comcast account with a coinbase account or whether he/she already knew this when seizing my comcast account.

Anyone else had their phone service compromised in association with their coinbase account being hacked?

UPDATE: Looks like this may have all started with the MtGox data breach - I used my COMCAST services bill to verify my identity with them way back when I opened an account in 2012.
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:05:42
does coinbase have phone support?
@_date: 2014-06-10 14:46:24
also need to return to my practice of never leaving coins on an exchange account for more than 24 hrs
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:22:55
my 2FA is SMS. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 06:08:19
the issue with coinbase is that they don't require the 2fa step for password resets if its been enabled on the account. As long as someone has access to your email you're screwed. Even Bank of America knows better than this! - you cant make ANY changes to your online account without a 2fa verification step for each change.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:21:52
Yes I confirm that Posternut and I have indeed been in contact about our Coinbase accounts being robbed. My account was robbed on Jun 6 between midnight and 3 am.
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:26:24
UPDATE: Hacker redirected 2fa to the following phone number: 631-609-7552. Look familiar to anyone?
This is a VERIZON WIRELESS mobile phone number established in BRENTWOOD, NY.

HAD a little online....(not confirmed but assuming coins are gone)

Guess I need to move to Circle since their online service comes with insurance
@_date: 2014-06-10 12:16:43
yes MOST of my coin is in paper wallets. I like having a little online (always less then 3 -5) to facilitate use
@_date: 2014-06-11 05:26:19
so i confirm that bitcoins were stolen from my account and sent to 
does anybody know this address?

Just because you think someone is plotting against you doesn't mean they aren't 8-0

@_date: 2016-05-02 08:29:49

or is possible that Dimon is downplaying Bitcoin so that if the price craters, he can buy at a discount? Why for example did his former quasi-protege Blythe Masters bid for BTC in the latest US Marshal's auction?
