Which one? lol
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:13:02
Dude omg lol this is the exact same convo I’ve had with friends at work. I bought in at 8.5 so pretty close.
Them:”damn saw that bitcoin crashed, you lose all your money?”
Me:”I hold several coins including bitcoin and uh bitcoin is more than double still from November so.... I also bought about 4-5 grand than what it’s at so.......
Them:”yeah what are you gonna do when it all goes away?”
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:16:59
I sold at 15k
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:20:18
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:37:38
I’m glad I cashed out all my initial investment. Whatever happens now is just fun 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:42:35
Cue judgment day theme 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:02:15
BUCKLE YOUR SAFERY BELTS 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:24:17
You can put 100 in Tron, and if it hits 10 bucks you made a 3-4K so idk about that. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:16
Yeah I mean bitcoin reaching 200k would be the same as Tron teaching 30 cents as far as your investment is concerned. So idk you tell me what’s a better bet 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:35:38
This guy fucks
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:42:09
Also I transferred 500 in bitcoin , 500 in ethereum, and 500 in litecoin. Bitcoin costs 17 dollar network fee and took 2.5 hours. Litecoin costs 83 cents took 10 minutes and ethereum costs a dollar or so and was done in 2 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:05:15
That’s under the new tax law. That doesn’t take place until next year starting Jan 1st.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:24:22
He’s probably not a person. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:20:37
I said most USAmericans don’t understand metrics because they couldn’t convert between them. Nobody needs to use our dated and medieval measuring system if they are using metrics. Why do most in this sub bicker? You really honestly think the average American knows metrics? Like, the ones who are only maybe narrowly voting against a pedophile right now in Alabama ? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:21:28
Shit got too real 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:51:39
How do you claim the forks?
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:40:10
Omg yes! FOR NEXT YEAR 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:42:11
I can’t even purchase right now.... really frustrating every time big things happen suddenly Coinbase is down 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:54:02
Your point? Bitcoins trends while volatile short of an actually pop are pretty easy to predict. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:55:24
Yes yeti, I would shy away with something as volatile as bitcoin then. When I first traded I lost a bit and it took longer to double my investment because of that. Safe stocks to buy right now (and profitable ) would be solar and several biotech companies. Video game and some tech stocks are also sound investments. Download Robinhood! It’s absolutely free and no fees to trade :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:33:03
And I would only be out 150 soooooooooooooo lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:20:22
So what happens with a fork? Do I get free coins?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:17:12
Well you see we had all these great Bush era tax cuts and deregulation’s... and then we had a recession. 
Idk they lower tax deductions for the middle and lower class to cut corporate taxes and give some ridiculous tax cuts to the exorbitantly rich?
Which raises the deficit by upwards of 1.5 trillion per year????????????????
And anything decent for lower class folk expires in 10 years however all the upper class and corporate cuts are permanent. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:30:36
And bitcoin would need to hit 200k for that. Yeah and it’s also only 100 dollars lol just saying. I’m all for bitcoin I have a few grand in it, however I’m all for promising coins. From my experience with the big 3 ethereum wins for ease of use and fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:38:55
I also doubled my money on the US stock market with no trading experience after losing 60% in my first month. So yeah I think I’ve learned enough to understand what I’m doing. That’s why I said reasonably experienced trader 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:35:11
Well since you obviously have no intention but laying in on me I don’t really see a point in continuing. I was trying to provide good advice and yeah it would be taxed at 35 percent but if it’s under 6000 it would be exempt under the minimum? Even if it’s not if you make correct moves you will still be making more. And consider I am increasing my bitcoin through trading not switching it to usd and depositing in my bank account... so for me with the value of coin only increasing .... I would gladly pay a tax rebate (which given I just purchased a plug in hybrid should essentially be all my taxes).
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:35:31
Uhhhhhhh Flynn just implicated Jared Kushner and plead guilty to lying to the fbi in a plea deal. Trump is tweeting he never fired comey over Russia and an obstruction case is building. He also may face questioning regarding the sexual harassment and assault of 13 women and if he’s caught lying could be impeached for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:59:37
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:54:58
To transfer ? Depends on how you are transferring and which service/ expands you use . Even Coinbase it’s only a dollar
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:33
Then it will go up????

No miners process transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:07:15
Oh well, not here to impress just commenting most Americans do not know fuck all about metrics unless they are scientists.
Ask someone how many liters is in a 2 gallon container of water and that’s your proof.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:51
Thank you. I’ve been day trading stock for a year it’s super easy to profit 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:54:48
Idk. The same financial guys who have said it would grow to this level also said bitcoin for less than 100k is cheap 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:33:17
Cus we’re retarded. And most don’t understand metrics. If I say I’m 178 cm Americans have no idea how to convert. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:40:00
Yeah???? That’s because I just factored in another investment. Need screenshots?  Because of my tax bracket I won’t owe capitol gains anyways...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:13:10
But for the bitcoin to arrive?????

I would travel Europe for an entire year over buying that shit
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:35:07
Yeah I’m also not just sitting here trading all day, to be fair. To make a little extra if I see the opportunity I go for it. But def not just flipping coins all day if that’s the impression you got lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:41:27
So you don’t use public services?

Recommend a wallet for monero that is easy to convert?

Very similar to most Americans saying the rest of the world should just use English instead of considering their own ethnocentricity. But hey what do I know?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:00:13
I can agree with your sentiment here but no taxes is impossible. Humanity would be screwed. 
However look what the libertarians have don rwith trump. Now our taxes will be higher, our healthcare shittier, and no EPA and our net can be throttled or targeted, and it’s prices exploited.  All so people with 11 million dollars can give it all to their kids and corporations can pay bigger dividends to shareholders.
So your vote does matter. 
My advice get crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:10:56
150 dollars???????????????????? And maybe the average but no. Most Americans aren’t close to that. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:50:51
? I live in USA. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:37:07
This guy fucks 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:28:28
Uh they literally reformed the tax code around crypto because crypto is considered like kind. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:31
You kidding? This is Trump’s baby as much as the GOP. He signed it in and deserves more blame than any single congressmen for forcing them to draft it so quickly.
He personally stands to make hundreds of millions off it.

Ah well I can’t get any decent employment or even go to university. So it’s a big deal to me but yes haha ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:34
Some change? You can’t exchange cryptos now without being taxed capital games everytime. Republicans fucked us- I know tons of libertarians are here but when will people realize the GOP and Trump only give a fuck about the rich? They add in tax deductions for purchasing private jets and now tax crypto trading. They want you poor, unhealthy and stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:56:47
So you mean the dollar?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:41:46
They take 1 dollar from whatever you are paying with. If bank account, dollar there, if credit card, dollar there. The fees vary but it will tell you the fee straight off. Once you submit stuff for approval in Coinbase you can transfer stuff to gdax and use that to trade. Far cheap.

I doubled my original investment. I started with 500 in stock not bitcoin. Lost 250. Ended up at 987. I lost 250 on one stock too not multiple bad trades and it was when I just started 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:57:14
Yeah I’m getting so many great dedications on the golf courses I own and all the private jets I buy. Winning.

@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:37
Phew what a relief /s
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:58:54
No, because trump is also about to be impeached. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:04:17
Yeah we could still use solar farms tho...
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:54:50
You really think most Americans use math? We are on a subreddit. Odds are everyone here is a cut above in the intellectual aspect. And I’m American so..... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:55:58
Most people I meet laugh when I ask if they read. Most Americans don’t even read let alone use metrics and they laugh about learning a second language
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:42:23
No idea. I’ve invested in stock for about 17 months and doubled my investment. In one week and 300 dollars, I’ve made 125 dollars with very minimal trading on gdax.

Trx doubled my money last night. Definitely not a shitcoin anyways lol and IOTA. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:10:13
Yea more or less. I’m obviously not converting to the .001 decimal point haha
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:05:34

But for purchases to end up wallet... 7 -10 days
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:59:12
Kind of? Pyramid scheme is a bit different. Bitcoin isn’t reliant on recruiting a team of people to sell bitcoin under you, and you take a percentage thereby meaning the higher up the more you make. Joe American who bought bitcoin years ago took a risk on a relatively unknown technology and now made a tidy profit. Billy miner became a part of the network and mined a few thousand bitcoin back in the day and same for him. Sarah decided to get in now and is still making healthy profits. How is it a pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:53:16
That. That sounds like horribly stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:10:43
Why is everyone such a hater on trading ? Ffs.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:20:20
Today, a little under half of American homes are worth enough to justify itemizing mortgage interest and property taxes. Under the tax legislation, that figure would fall to close to 14 percent, according to an analysis of the plan by the online real estate marketplace Zillow.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:06:42
Yeah IOTA is my next buy :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:34:52
It’s only taxed this year if you cash out
Lol why am I being downvoted? The new tax bill starts next year does not retroactively apply to 2017

Ya it’s not nothing though. It’s over the consumption of Ireland.

Yes you don’t drive on the roads and weren’t educated as a child after all. Pure theft
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:44:30
Oh I missed that- but why the fuck would someone using metrics need to use what one backwards ass country uses anyways?

But please sir, render your taxes into Caesar. ��������
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:12:04
Yeah but it’s because the gas level was higher so that’s why, to make it so fast. But idk how much it actually was anyways, wasn’t paying attention but yeah dollar or less 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:03:00
lol yeah . I mean stock would be one thing... real estate is one of the most valuable investments one can have 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:26
Why? I mean ok if you have never traded stock you shouldn’t. However if you are a even semi experienced trader you can make a shit ton on bitcoin. I made 150 bucks this week with 350 investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:56:31
Also bullish on Great Depression 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:27:52
I think day trading is flipping at all really. If you buy hold and only sell once or never sell that’s not really trading. You do it once or twice a week (selling included) it would count. I see don’t sell everyday just when I see an opportunity 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:54:05

Compared to what I made in stock it is. But cool I get you can’t day trade.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:48:45
I mean sure. I guess I’m a luddhist that way. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:47:50
Well I’m 175 but yeah that’s almost 5’11 for 178 cm
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:03:02
Yes most certainly. Because of the type of algorithm used, it is possible for regular people to mine. (Without much investment I mean) and it’s being used by the UN on a trial basis. If it starts being used more in transactions it’s gonna blow up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:01:46
Same goes for Litecoin, it’s just younger. I suspect it will be as bitcoin- gold. Ethereum= silver, litecoin/Satoshi = Bronze 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:27:13

Seriously if anybody wants eth and litecoin to take off stop just hoarding it, and spend some. This is what will grow their value. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:01:00
No, bitcoin will not because it wastes energy. Cryptos that become green or produce less emissions will surpass bitcoin. I think it will peak at a million though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:44:37

Environmental crisis. Obviously the root cause isn’t bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:08:34
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:48:06
I read an article from a respected economist who said as long as bitcoin is below 100k, it’s cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:02:51
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:52:04
It really does. I can’t even buy when it dipped... wtf. I think ethereum is going to be the winner in the long term. Because of it’s actual use in applications.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:40:44
Depends on the alt
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:07:29
Do you think there will be a major dip soon? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:01
Do you pay a fee just to transfer money out of Coinbase ? Like my bitcoin into kraken 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:52:26
It’s just a sitcom... I know literally no one who watches cable. Millennials are on Netflix and other streaming... I hope it has an effect but I think the fact I heard a story about bitcoin on bbc and npr yesterday will have a larger effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:04:01
Day trading ? None unlesss they already did with stocks. Buying a dip? All of them?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:26:05
Or baby driver..... that movie is meta now though. Who is the real baby driver? Was it Kevin Spacey driving baby all along?
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:23:11
Yeah I wanna see the link. My only fear is how astronomical the energy cost is. Unless people are attached to solar or something that’s a fuck ton of pollution. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:39:04
Yeah it was going anywhere, but it will be surpassed. Just like the Denarius. Just how the world works. Most things are ephemeral.
I just hope once Wall Street is in, they don’t pump and dump to rake away money from normal people.

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:20:04
Kind of a straw man isn’t it?
Bitcoin is fueled directly by energy in its creation same as other resources. However it’s only a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:06:04
Yeah but I could put 3 grand on a card and pay it back easy in that time. All I meant 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:36:05
Wouldn’t it be smarter to sell and then re-buy at the dip? So you have more bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:08:35
Why would you ever use scottrade when Robinhood exists?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:40:22

What if I told you.... ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:42:44
Wouldn’t that just be buying Lamborghinis with bitcoin? Not really selling bitcoin if it’s the predominant form of currency lol

I would probably feel the same I’m just a little late to the party, so my goal is at least a 1 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:52:39
Is kraken bad?
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:43:43
Apt comparison friend 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:02:47
Yes. I’ll be at least satisfied if I get to one. Really regretting that I bought this car two weeks ago...
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:39:47
Trump will be blamed anyways. He is our Nero, except retarded instead of crazy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:25:17
First solar baby..
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:03:45
I really don’t get this. Who tf watches sitcoms in 2017 on network tv?
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:24:05
And remind me, which service do most first time bitcoiners use? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:00
Can confirm. Only insiders got the dip 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:05:24
Yea I ageee with you. Sorry if I came off hostile I just keep seeing this. I think it’s more exciting I heard about bitcoin on both NPR and BBC. BBC two nights in a row!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:19:29
Can someone recommend an exchange with a reliable app???? Please?????
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:15:26
I think it will reach 1 mill eventually, and I meant to add in the parentheses 100k within 5 years. Probably closer to 3 hopefully 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:24:45
Yeah I’ve doubled my stock this year. And it’s my first year lol 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:30
People who run the exchanges????
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:27:52
I guess it depends. Does Coinbase allow instant trades like Robinhood?
Cus I do it all the time on Robinhood, sell at 65, dip hits, rebuy at 52. Now it’s only back to 60 but I’m still way up. Lol and if it’s considerable dip (couple thousand like a week or so ago when it dipped) you would make a tidy profit and have more bitcoin to hold. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:16:53
Ethereum is amazing . I just mike it solo
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:01:51
Luxury? Literally everybody under 55 has one lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:15:27
Nah, I wish I could buy at 2300. You will be sitting pretty give it some time 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:23
Well I’m dumb then. I still feel the same about how they will function. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:42:59
Right... but demographics? People watch fox too. Probably not the ppl buying bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:16
Guys I went in 700 dollars on bitcoin, 90 for 1 litecoin, and 200 on eth.... wish I went all bitcoin. That 700 has already made me 230 bucks! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:34:57
Remind me! 1 year 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:47:18
I liked him on h3
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:41:40
Yes but I couldn’t spend over 1000 ��������
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:20:19
 No? It would be 16 some trillion market cap, and global money supply is north of 20 trillion. US alone is 13 some trillion... so yeah it can get there.
Edit: world is at 68.7 trlllion
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:48
I would have, but new Coinbase user , also fuck them. 10 days?????
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:26
How do you make that? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:22:08
Why is trolling? Earth is facing a crisis so why wouldn’t it matter?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:55
That’s bullshit fuck them both. Is kraken more reliable? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:45:27
Ah gotcha 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:06
Ok DJ khaled
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:07:03
Yeah that’s what I’m mining right now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:27:05
What why is that? The fees are only like 1%
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:14:40
Yeah right? Boy we bout to hit 100k in 6 months 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:32:36
Satoshi’s or bust baby 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:52:52
Right? I’m glad I got 5% at 8,800. Still shooting myself for buying lame ass stock last November instead of bitcoin. 
I was much less tech literate, I’m sure that contributed to my fatal errors.... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:56:47
It clearly did. No normal people could use Coinbase or gdax .... sketchy as fuck. Myself included 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:52:20
Yeah I guess you only profit if you are an insider. So much for buying the dip. Fucking sketchy 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:30:47
I understand just didn’t know if there was exchange app by Coinbase for use, or if I should use kraken. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:04:36
Bail out?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:16
Is gdax computer based only? Not mobile?
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:47
Yeah I’m just gonna move it all to kraken
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:55:24
Ok... but if bitcoin does replace currency.... you don’t see my point? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:59:12
How long did dip take last milestone?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:50
Who tf watches sitcoms????
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:40
The bottom..???? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:23:19
Don’t you worry that they are about to do just that?
I’m with you though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:47:25
No it’s 32 mill listen to at least one hour.  And npr will repeat the story so . NPR’s demographics is also 25 year olds- 55. Idk about Big Bang theory 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:08:59
Yeah, right? and speculation is speculation. Sorry my idea doesn’t match up with yours...? Haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:20:28
The irony of your post history new redditor. Asking if local breweries have become too greedy... lmao. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:07:45
Tether is an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:48
Don’t see GDAX In App Store, recommendations? Is it browser based only? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:29:47
Because the American education system is built to financially rape you, and if Devos has her way, any subsidized education will probably wither away as well.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:21
No but this is sketching me out. Really fuckiny sketchy 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:38
Isn’t it also bad? Because then Wall st can just pump and dump like they do with everything else and rake away our money ....
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:35:13
Remindme! 1 year 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:32:18
Ahhh Hegelian dialectics. 
The sweet smell of a collapsing decadent republican society. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:35:43
Uh. That law doesn’t come into place until 2018 anyways... but yeah. Whatever you say mannnnnnnnnn
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:52:37
I think 4 will be bottom. Then it will rebound and eventually hit 50k.... not saying how quick though 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:45:54
Yeah the right DEFINITELY has no control over money. They get way less lobbying funds from private donors /s
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:03:47
Duh the bubble is bursting. USA is losing its place and the USD with it. Great Depression V 2.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:53:01
Xbox? Why would you ever buy an Xbox lol let’s run all my PC games, but shittier and at later dates xD
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:21:55
Ah makes more sense. Also so does a roku
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:10:13
HOLD FOR THE HOLD THRONE
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:26:43
Oh wow then no way. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:34:29
Nope. Only American war crimes and leaked emails of those assange has a personal vendetta against. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 17:50:15
Right something something principal something something 
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:01:21
Wait so it’s not a wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:27
Ethereum is more than a currency.. that’s why lol
