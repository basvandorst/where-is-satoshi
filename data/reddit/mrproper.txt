What kind of fees? Something like 15$ when I send $100 through my bank? Or 13$ when someone sends $50 using WU? Or maybe $0.65 when I buy a cheap $5 battery on ebay? What about $0.45 when I tip $1 on twitch.tv...
Right now all of the above cost $0.003 in Bitcoin, and nobody has a problem with that (I'm a medium miner). It's the only practical benefit of using Bitcoin the peer to peer digital cash.

Why do you need to run a virtual server unless you are a pool, exchange, service provider or heavy user (which is weird to be in it's own category, you are definitely in one of the first three)?

If everyone of those 288000 users decide they want one bitcoin transaction per day, the fees they will pay such that they don't surpass 0.01 BTC and 1% of their average transaction will not allow for a price higher than 3500 USD. This has been simulated in several ways by Peter R on Bitcointalk.

They allow a rapid hike to 20Ghz per logic gate (from 8Ghz) with enough room for improvements up to 40Ghz. Further than that the SNR is too large and reduces performance. Also because there are multiple wavelenghts, you can do some interesting things like [multiple cores on the same physical path or multiplexing the transfer speeds](
Then we can get on [graphene]( (we already have working memory chips), and after that we can do quantum.

Probably because of high velocity caused by unbound arrogance...
Why is it better for Bitcoin to be robust, limited and outdated? What does it mean to "be Bitcoin"? You mean like the first paragraph in the [Bitcoin's whitepaper]( Let's do that maybe, I like that.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:56:27
Without a secured timestamp on the blockchain confirming to the whole world that the transaction is irreversible, loss or fraud might occur. It's also not about the 10 minutes, but about the hour. Bitcoin guarantees with a high degree that 6 confirmations are virtually irreversible. In reality the reversing would instead cost 31000 USD in mining costs from miner majority collusion. If you don't get that, then you don't get Bitcoin.

He's afraid of changes because he has a large stash. He can't compute why this is a good thing and prefers no changes as that is the least danger.
Meanwhile bitcoin might fall in favor of something more capable and his stash will turn to dust, but he can't see that now because he is stupid.
Alternatively he wants to increase his stash and being a journalist he manipulates the masses so he can buy in more cheaply then switch sides at the right time because he is intelligent.
Pick one of the above.

Highly improbable, blocks are now at half a megabyte, it's not possible to have all 1Mb blocks even if we try. Not enough transactions and the pools use smaller blocks sometimes.

@_date: 2015-06-09 11:47:55


If you're not prepared for the update ahead of time (by having the limit raised but not used in your client), you will be left frozen in time and unable to use the Bitcoin network after the first 1MB+ block. Some nodes are older than one year, they will be left behind.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:37:05
Yes, we need that. However we would not be using Bitcoin at that moment, whatever we would use must have all the properties of Bitcoin: secure decentralized irreversible trust-less permission-less settlements.
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:35:37


20MB, 8MB, 2MB, it's all the same today, there is no effective difference! Why don't people get this?
In a few years 8MB might be too small, the idea is to allow a higher hard-coded hard to change limit so we can increase blocks as needed.

Yes, we can. There are many altcoins, the use this exact method to identify their blockchains.


This is called pegging. This feature is not yet available. Consider also that one blockchain has better security than the other.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:34:00
That's how it literally works for anything else that is a stock or commodity (even currency for short terms).
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:53:07


Because it's border-less, permission-less, anonymous and secured against data loss, hacking, mathematical errors.
@_date: 2015-06-24 22:52:11
Because it is promoted by reflex when we discuss the 1MB volume without consideration to the point at hand. Even with Lightning, the number of daily transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain remains limited, we can't move completely off-chain and benefit from the same features:
* secure - each bitcoin transaction is secured at a cost of 2.7 USD in electricity alone (infrastructure and maintenance could be similar, so put that at 5 USD). Can sidechain/offchain/channel transactions be as secure with lower costs? My experience with altcoins disagrees.
* decentralized - well if the channel is between me and another party... where is the decentralization? How are other nodes involved in distributing and maintaining our activity? They are not.
* irreversible - apparently data loss or lack of action causes default settlement which might not match intent.
* trust-less - not sure if there is trust required in the second party, third party is still trustless because of blockchain consensus
* permission-less - can you execute transactions without permission? Maybe some can be done so.
* settlement time/complexity/cost - I want to buy a car in Germany from one partner and sell it in Russia to another partner. I still make 2 transactions on the blockchain. Do I make another extra set to open the channels and then close them, while also making transactions inside the channels? Wouldn't that make extra fees, add to the complexity and increase execution time for my business?

@_date: 2015-06-20 15:44:08
Yes. Block size, fee level and userbase are correlated. With 1Mb, price can be max 3500 USD, and userbase limited to 288000 daily users. Centralization arguments are strawmen, people should learn how Bitcoin works before using that word.
@_date: 2015-06-20 16:20:37
What's wrong with p2p technology? Why do people insist on using centralized third parties with draconic probing and terms.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:24:01


Good question. Here are some other unnecessary trade-offs:
* un-trusted off-chain third party transaction operator
* running multiple pieces of software, with extra storage and bandwidth
* paying hugely expensive fees on par with shitty banking services
* waiting days for a low fee transaction confirmation
Why would everyone install Bitcoin on their laptop? It would take minutes to sync when you want to use it, it reduces security compared to other wallets, it uses resources on possibly metered connections, it slows down your laptop, and you will shut it down once you finish your transactions. The benefits of running a full node for a few minutes is not superior to the trade-offs.
Meanwhile companies like blockchain.info, miners or payment gateways will keep 600 nodes connected to their node and keep it running 24/7, having economies of scale and profits to cover any costs.

Channels are isolated, transactions inside one channel can't make it into transactions in another channel. Also if I don't subscribe, I can't participate in the sidechannel. Maybe I'm mistaking.


It says in the draft, if one party loses data, the other can defraud the channel. Because data is not recorded in a ledger, the channel is temporary and it's state can be lost. Unlike Bitcoin.


How do you enforce unique intent? For example not sending the same resource to two parties at the same time. If OT works just as well, why do we need Bitcoin? Fuck that noise, down with the greedy miners!

I think that's ok because they only expose their private details to each-other. Again, payment channels do not offer the full Bitcoin properties.
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:54:53
I don't know about you, but I don't need a full node to move money, and I have my own private wallets, lots of them. Also even businesses delegate the blockchain storage to other more efficient companies (there is even a mining pool with large percentage that uses another pool's node to mine). And the $60 will be needed in 2021, the price would actually be lower by then. And whomever needs to run the node will spend ten times more on other hardware than this measly small change. let's hyperbole away until Bitcoin dies in obscurity as the failed experiment of social decentralization victim to egotistical dictatorship...
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:41:26


True, but the regular person doesn't keep their PC or laptop open or connected 24/7, there are no real features available in Core that can't be used in other wallets. Think about the regular people that will use Bitcoin, all the hacker geeks that might know about Bitcoin, already know about it, and they might do what you ask. But not regular people.


I know of several people that have lost Bitcoin from their PCs by various security issues. I know of zero people that have lost Bitcoin using mobile wallets. And we don't need to talk about web wallets.
There has to be a balance somewhere. Things like pruning and headers-first tighten the gap between casual and dedicated users a bit.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:41:29
I specifically explained we are talking about the Bitcoin blockchain. The offchain is not Bitcoin, it doesn't have the same properties, of course billions of people could use an off-chain, they do that now. But the actual issues was that only 275000 daily transactions/settlements/users/payments/checkpoints are possible each day, no matter how much people think they can pay for fees in 1MB.
I'll downvote myself to lessen your embarrassment now...
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:37:52
You have to realize that the majority of the miners (999KB or 749KB) actually try to fit as many transactions as they can. Or there are transactions to fill their quota and they won't change it. So in a way, the capacity is full for the majority of the blocks in the screenshot. Yes, a third of the blocks aren't maxed out. And it's 2015, imagine that by 2016, all blocks will be maxed out at 1MB and you will wait hours for your daily allotted slot on the blockchain, alongside a maximum of 288000 users just like you.
Of course some miners will find a block 10 seconds after another and forget to prepare all the transactions in it. Or even worse, the chinese miners will publish empty blocks 30s after the last block to make sure they don't get orphaned blocks (as conflicting height on included transactions will fail validation, no transactions, impossible to fail, milisecond time to switch to last block).

It has more to do with the fact that between 1995 and 2005 all the Internet connections were through dial-up or shared in big neighborhood LANs. Civilians built most of the metropolitan network infrastructure with the cheapest possible costs (decentralized networking, no fees, IRC, counter-strike and file-sharing). ISPs were able to connect cities and after 2005 capture this already educated userbase into their networks, first via subsidiaries. But there are 3 large competitors now and they compete to provide good services and lower prices. 
Density is also important, the bigger cities host a larger percentage of the population compared to other countries.

That is the "sell time or things for digital cash" angle. I was talking more about meeting bitcoin users in your area, using localbitcoins.com, mycellium local trader, craiglist, bitcointalk or other social networks to meet people and exchange bitcoin without high fees or invasive verifications.
For example I operate on LocalBitcoins and Mycellium's Local Trader. I participate in a national bitcoin Skype group, started my city's Facebook bitcoin users group and I made many contacts on bitcointalk for selling/buying miners and bitcoin. Right now I am on voice chat with almost 10 bitcoin projects developers, exchanging bitcoins is something I never have to worry about.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:23:55


Trust the consensus. Yes, you can only use Bitcoin if you trust the consensus, which is a form of "everyone else".
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:44:40


Bitcoin offers this new thing called **consensus**. While you might be identifying yourself when making a transaction (confirmed source), you may succeed in **double spends** (unconfirmed transaction). While OT/multisig/PGP/etc confirms your intent, it doesn't stop you from malicious attacks. We need Bitcoin for that, so you can trust the irreversibility of the transactions, ownership transfer, option choice, etc.


There are none, as we don't have functional side-chains yet. But if I wanted to conduct business with Alice, and Bob, I would probably need to download their respective side-chains where they decide to operate, besides Bitcoin. Instead of using one piece of software, I now need 3 pieces of software and 3 databases. So in reality, instead of making Bitcoin scale to 10Mb blocks, I get 1Mb blocks from Bitcoin, 5Mb blocks from Alice sidechain and 5Mb blocks from Bob sidechain. So I use the same bandwidth, processing power and storage space as if Bitcoin had bigger blocks, but instead with more failure points and more complexity. Unnecessary.


Consensus, double spends, security, etc, etc.


See above.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:39:58
This discussion is over 4 years old already, when Satoshi was still working on Bitcoin. The block limit should have been already increased by now, it's a shame that some stubborn Bitcoin developers cling to excuses and fail to plan ahead. One of them thinks he is 10 times smarter than Satoshi, the other one is stuck with technology from 1995 and actually wants to decrease block size. Neither of them understands economics of scale or even the technological progress taking place under their noses.
I don't understand why you are against increasing the block size to cover required capacity in critically important software project. "That literally makes no sense". Who formed your opinion? How did they get you? How do you excuse yourself for being against bitcoin growth and adoption?

The blocks will increase depending on transaction usage and not political decision. Your schedule doesn't actually do anything different, blocks won't be fully used any time soon, so 2Mb or 20Mb is the same.
You need to prepare the 20Mb limit now, so you can increase 1Mb to 2Mb any time you like without issues. Same for 2Mb to 4Mb.

Luke would cut everyone's legs if the bed were too short. He would like his pool to process only 400kb blocks because that's the minimum capacity for Bitcoin not to become useless. I guess Bitcoin can remain a 2015 thing forever. Just like other digital cash projects that failed.

How is a message that pays fees undesired? You say you are not against gambling sites, but yet when they use Bitcoin to determine and secure proof of fairness, suddenly it becomes "spam". No, it's not spam, the player and the betting house DESIRE those transactions. Also the miners that collect the fees, also DESIRE the transactions. It's not SPAM.

Excuse me but I understood something different from the [draft](


balances, deferring the transaction broadcast to the blockchain in a single transaction netting
out the total balance between those two parties. 
First, if I want to work with X entities I need X channels opened. You seem to suggest a cardinality of 6 per year. At this level, **Bitcoin can accommodate 16 729 167 unique users**. Still too few, and this is using Lightning. I also think 6 tx/year is a very low number, I may need 2-3 new channels each month, and there is still need for settlements every so often.


Give me Lightning and we can discuss how wrong I am.

You can't possibly be this bad at math. I mean you make software, think in log scales and run a highly profitable mining pool. Oh... wait, nevermind... I take that back... you are bad at math!
Luke, get your head out of your ass. The current growth of the number of transactions shows *December 2016 as the date when 1Mb blocks will be 100% filled all the time*, meaning you will wait hours or days for a transaction to confirm once.
Meanwhile Litecoin will do it in 2.5 minutes, it's not false advertising, it's what people need, one confirmation. All your reasons are hogwash and really in disconnect with reality. Yesterday you were afraid people with 56k modems won't be able to use Bitcoin. Are you serious? Is this 1995? What's next?! Patch Bitcoin Core so it has a speed boost on 286 16 bit processors?

This is the breaking point that everyone refers to, which will happen if the block size can't be raised at the right time (requires 12 months preparation before decision). There are three main scenarios that will happen at that time, shared by various bitcoiners:
* Blocks remain at 1MB forever, fees go up a bit, transactions go down a bit, price may go up a bit (5000-50000 USD), Bitcoin becomes the new SWIFT/Digital-gold network serving big players (the Mircea Popescu dream)
* Blocks remain at 1MB forever, fees go up heavily, price may go up a bit (no more than ~3000 USD), we will pay 1-3% per transaction, on par with Paypal or banks. Alternatively we will wait 3 days for a cheaper transaction, on par with SWIFT or banks.
* Blocks remain at 1MB forever, Bitcoin is not broken but something superior comes along. Since one of the two killers has arrived, it will remain a regular altcoin while people move to other things like Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, Fedcoin to do the things we do cheaply and quickly today on Bitcoin. Price dumps (30-80 USD) to match new security costs (even if difficulty goes up) and new expectations (because people want the new better things).
Time and time again altcoins have failed to surpass Bitcoin because they offered little real features above Bitcoin and never surpassed the security benefits. And Bitcoin has never failed technically more than 6 hours. If one of these things changes, people will migrate to the new thing.
Imagine a new Bitcoin starting from 0, with no Mircea Popescu, no Winlevoss brothers, no Satoshi stash, no Silkroad confiscated funds, no previous scams, all the lessons learned. Many people would go into that.

So much FUD and people looking at the half they like. Here's the other half:
1. "relatively cheap to acquire and validate" using technology available in 2015. What about 2020? Do we have the same technology, or do we have stronger technology able to "relatively cheap to acquire and validate" the bigger blockchain?
2. Costs? A new 1TB HDD costs 60 USD. This will be filled in 1 million blocks, or 19 years. JOMG, how expensive, 60 dollars to last for 20 years!
3. Less people? Miners (pools) are the only nodes that matter in regards to network security. They are rewarded to store the blockchain, because if they don't then they can't mine.
The anti-20MB people are concerned because they eat FUD all day long and like to be blind and ignorant in regards to progress. They are anti-progress, they don't have the concept of future in their thinking, only past. If they form a majority, then the pro-progress people will move to another thing that is better than Bitcoin and allows future development (litecoin, nxt, ethereum, etc).

Good thing the 20MB blocks will fill up around 2021, whoever wants to run an important node on the network by then, won't be using 5Mbit...

Have you? It shows that today we could use 350KB as a critical block size (we need 450KB if you do a normal analysis, not a biased one), a figure that has grown from 200KB just a year ago, or 120KB two years ago. At this rate of 75% a year, we will need 600KB next year (still safe) and 1070KB blocks in two years. It will happen sooner if there is a spike in Bitcoin activity.
While we are safe for another year, if we don't plan anything until two years have passed, Bitcoin will be either too expensive to use, or used by fewer people. If you like that to happen, then support the boiling frogs in their road to the core...

Irrelevant as it seems, we can observe the increases in network speed, computing power and storage density per dollar for the last years and there are no reasons for these trends to deviate much.

What was bitcoin made for? I read the whitepaper again, especially the part where Bitcoin is digital cash. Just like you can gamble with physical cash in a casino, so you can gamble with digital cash in a ledger. By design transactions are made without consent of other parties except the first party (nobody actively accepts bitcoins sent to them). 


Some of them have done that indeed. But as far as I can tell, the ones that provide public audits on all bets can not cheat. Maybe there is a way to prevent that besides mathematical censorship.


If I send you some Bitcoin to buy an 115kbit modem, buy some drugs on the darknet for myself, or send the same bitcoin to a betting site, the full nodes do not desire my transaction either way. The only nodes that desire my transactions are miners. These are the only nodes that matter, the other nodes are doing it for kicks, this was recognized by Satoshi when pool mining came along and it was "fixed" by PoS coins later.
As a miner, I want those transactions. As a bitcoin user, I want those transactions. As a full node owner, I want those transactions or I will shut down my node, nobody is forcing me to keep it running without a miner, wallet or service behind it. 
Even if I don't gamble, maybe one day I will, or someone dear to me might. And he/she can do it safely and fairly because this wonderful technology allows this and does not censor it's intended purpose. You disagree with this as a miner and bitcoin user, which I don't understand. 
Thank you for your explanation.

Home users that need or want to run Bitcoin will afford it. Just like home users that build 3000$ gaming rigs compared to 300$ consoles, because they know what they're doing.
I can afford it now, but I'm not running a full node, there is no reason to. My node would not matter at all, it might even get in the way of commercial nodes using resources efficiently.
And again, if I am a company that makes more than 100$ profit a month from bitcoin activities, surely I could purchase a 50$ server that has sufficient resources at this time.
The increase in blocksize **limit**, not actual utilization does not do anything short-term, but again, I am so annoyed that people don't comprehend this. Did it bother you at all that blocks went from 500kb to 750kb last year? Of course not.
@_date: 2015-06-01 00:28:39
Why do you need to run a virtual server unless you are a pool, exchange, service provider or heavy user (which is weird to be in it's own category, you are definitely in one of the first three)?

That's because there is no whitepaper!
In the [draft]( it says some weird things:
* We propose a system using bitcoin
transaction scripting and micropayment channels, without custodial risk of theft. Sending
many payments inside these micropayment channel enables one to send large amounts of
funds to another party in a decentralized manner.
This still limits the number of channels that can be open or closed each day.
* Data Loss - When one party loses data, it is possible for the counterparty to steal funds. This can be
mitigated by having a 3rd party data storage service where encrypted data gets sent to this 3rd
party service which the 3rd party cannot decrypt. 
Not going to happen if you use Bitcoin. Let's store two chains, use two protocols, two pieces of software and hope they communicate correctly and don't lose data, because one of them can't recover.
* If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one person will make 3
blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million
users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions per MB). This is
quite limited, and **an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the
world using Bitcoin**. 
Oh, look at that...

Forking, divergence, emergence. We have a blockchain and not a blocktree. We can't merge two blockchains.

Good question. Context: I live in a poor ex-communist country where the average income is 5000 USD a year.
My 5 USD VPS has a 40Mbit upload and 250Mbit download on average, it's not possible for me to get any cheaper than this.
My 10 USD home internet connection is 500Mbit up/down, I can get the more expensive one at 12 USD, for 1Gbit up/down, but it's ludicrous, I don't watch too many blu-ray movies.
Right now my full node is using 22kbit down and 31kbit up (where did you take your figures from?!).
Multiply that by 20 and you get 0.4Mbit download and 0.6Mbit upload. Plenty for the next 5-6 years, in which time the technology will be better.
Why do you run a node? Do you have a mining pool, exchange or service using Bitcoin? Why do you need 10x more inbound connections if you don't run a profitable business to cover the server and internet costs?
Let's not forget about maximum capacity and actual usage. Even if we CAN have 20MB blocks, it will take a few years to get there.

He also worked for around a year on the first client release and resolved many issues during this time, there were no addresses at first, there were using IPs for transfers (because public keys were ugly and were attack vectors (they still are somewhat)). Someone mentioned ways to intercept and hijack payments and more work went into public addresses as a possibility of the cryptographic model used (private-public key model).
Bitcoin solves many issues at once and it was released when the solutions were all connected together.

It depends on the velocity. While bitcoin can be locked up for an hour per transaction compared  to cash that has days, you still get liquidity issues if global transfers require more than 13M * 500 USD per hour. Realistically, less than one million bitcoin is present on the market, so if you need 500 million dollars moved around, this price won't cut it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 19:15:19
This problem applies to basically **everything** under the sun. The value at this current time is probably not going to be its the value in the future.
With bitcoin, you have two cases:
* value will go up, you can mine at a slight loss or breakeven
* value will go down, stop now and liquidate everything
You should not discount however the first reason people mine: to obtain bitcoin. Those people will pay for mining hardware and upkeep if it's cheaper than market price, otherwise they go on the market. They want the bitcoin.

When using a logarithmic scale, a 1% change in price is different in absolute value if it's up or down. Bitcoin appears to operate on a log scale, mainly because the exchange fees are percentages.
Another aspect is the doubling of the price. The equivalent negative move is a halving. So if the price is 200%, then you would expect an action of the same intensity as the one when the price is at 50% (in the opposite direction of course).
Does this make any sense in the way I explained it?

There must have been a lack of clear statement, my fault, sorry. The statement should have been: "intelligent authors who have negative views on Bitcoin (either component of it), fail to comprehend the subject completely". You provided examples of intelligent authors who comprehend the subject, but are not against Bitcoin. I will reacall the part of your comment I replied to:


You provided two articles, both are trying to improve the protocol (I would call that supportive). Even these suggestions are basically irrelevant because they don't really add any significant improvement, and one of them does not show deep understanding of the subject. It is possible that at the moment, any **papers suggesting improvements are not possible** because of two factors:
* there are very very few opportunities for improvements because it was worked on for months by one or many highly trained developers before release (see preliminary 2008 proposals).
* the developer community proposes, approves and implements improvements faster than academia can pick up the discussion, see this short list for example:

Yes, but as you can see the price goes down when Ghash becomes dangerous. If the price goes down to half, no hardware might be profitable to invest in, with the limited hope it will recover the situation. If Ghash is attacked, being half the power, it can retaliate back on others.

If I had 51% of the network I would fork off. Then each block I would be 4% ahead of the other network, statistically. I would broadcast my blocks to the peers and they would see I have the longest chain, always. Miners try to leave my pool? I only pay them on my chain, now they will have to forfeit their income to stop me. The price would plummet, other miners would go below profit and leave, lowering the speed of the other chain. I will keep bitcoin centralized forever, how can someone stop me?

First paper is just a fancy way to describe a Sybil attack combined with the effects of Tragedy of the Commons. Transaction witholding has no net effect, the miner nodes will broadcast them if they want the fees. This is the incentive. At worst, the concealed transactions will be known to the entire network at the moment of the incentive collection. The transaction creator has an incentive to broadcast it to as many nodes as possible, and he will be inclined to do it towards nodes that act altruistically in the future. This is not a problem at the moment. Also there can be miner nodes that can relay transactions correctly but include none of them in the block to improve their race conditions. This is also not a problem, the next miner that includes those transactions collects ALL the accrued fees that the first miner ignored. What I see is a paper that discusses an improvement and does not actually dismiss Bitcoin as requested (see the GP's criteria for examples).
Second paper has been debunked by smarter people than me. There is also a tool to monitor in real time if it happens:  . Also, mining is already selfish, Satoshi also counter-intuitively made the retargeting function to need more time when reducing difficulty as a built-in measure to increase witholding efforts. If a large miner drops out of the network, their chain will retarget lower than the network and in a longer time period, effectively single miner withholding is a costly strategy. Collusion among many miners might also follow this pattern. But if the majority of miners follows this pattern, we have exactly what we have now. A normal functioning blockchain where all miners support eachother... and this paper does not dismiss Bitcoin either!
Nobody said that academic researches are idiots, I just said they are ignorant or superficial on their understanding of the design. And you still did not provide papers that dismiss bitcoin as you claime to have existed at the time of your post.

Almost. It's the same thing in functionality as a public key (but it's not complete and original), the information you provide for others to encode into transactions. You then use the private key to sign your own transactions received to this key, while also providing your REAL public key to demonstrate that it derives to the same address.

Yes, mostly because Coinbase is off-chain and can perform confirmed transactions instantly. But it still needs the blockchain to exist and function and is not as secure and free as the blockchain itself. As the monetary speed increases (inside Coinbase), less coins are needed to perform the same service (transfer money around quickly).
What is needed is for the world to realize Coinbase is centralization and regulation and start competing services to pick up the slack.

That's easy! Each node likely has it's own private key, or so should we count them as individual nodes (Sybil attacks not possible). Each stored chunk should be encoded with that public key and relayed back by decrypting it with the private key (prevents storage reuse).
This allows for the original chunk creator to check if the contents of the file are indeed available in each and every peer as it can ask the peer to sign a portion of the data and check it remotely. This prevents dispersion of the chunks with the original peer offline, so maybe there is another layer in the keychain to allow blinded redistribution.

If there were any addresses, a rescan would reorganize the local database to show previous transactions. Now you mentioned a single address and a rescan with no new transactions. This means that either you backed up a new empty unused wallet, or your wallet backup is corrupted/invalid.
You must find why you backed up an unused wallet and thought it was ok (or maybe you have a good backup somewhere), and try to delete the active bitcoin wallet and restore again from the backup (to see if the addresses change, would mean the file is corrupt but may be recoverable).
Please consider future proofing your wallets with [bitaddress.org]( (either by exporting your keys into QR or importing the QR key into the client).
Also test all your backups before going to sleep.

There are hundreds of organizations, some with thousands of accounts that need to paid on various models. While these are not traditional organizations, allow me to explain the cost reductions. The payment for each member is calculated in the system, one might say this would be the result of employee hours and benefits calculations. I was not referring to this aspect in the post above, only the action of "company funds for salaries" =&gt; "employee pockets".
* Middlecoin pays over 30000 miners a month, most of them EACH day. Sample transaction showing the fees of 0.0038% (less than half a dollar) for 254 members:  The single database server that logs the daily work and calculates payments can't cost more than 120$ a month. We are talking only about the funds transfers, so the cost of paying each member every day is ~0.002 dollars.
* Clevermining has over 7000 users, paying them several times a day. Sample transaction showing the fees of 0.01% for an hourly payment to 1000 users:  The mean payment frequency is around once a day for most members, as above the cost of paying each member every day is 0.002 dollars.

During a torrent download you participate in creating redundancy (prioritizing the rare file parts first), peering (allow peers to find new peers) and uploading (giving your completed parts to the other peers). Usually in bittorrent people give more resources than they spend, this would equate to a profit in decentralized storage.

It does. For example Coinbase is off-chain, all their transactions between owned blockchain addresses are instant. Thus the velocity is 600 times faster than using the blockchain and the same bitcoin can move 600 times between customers inside Coinbase, while it would only move once on the blockchain. The more bitcoin Coinbase has and the more users it has, the less they need to post transactions on the blockchain and cheaper bitcoin can be for the same amount of utility.
However security at the user level and company level is a high risk, you can get your account or funds locked (as many users report) or the company could make a mistake or go bankrupt and take a large portion of the user funds with them.
Obviously people don't care about security and they will just use Coinbase and pay them, similar to how banks work now. The bitcoins in their accounts will also be IOUs and not real bitcoins under their control. And real bitcoins will be needed less and fewer blockchain fees will be paid, lowering the security and value of the bitcoin.

In regular cash transactions, the other party gives you the correct change back. In Bitcoin (the protocol), you give yourself the change back and split the coin into whatever denomination you need down to the 8th decimal.
Please note that paper wallets are risky to use because of this feature, first transaction takes more or all of the coin in the public address and gives the change back in the client you used when sending. Reloading the paper wallet cleanly will only show untouched coins so be careful to not lose any.

No, actually the math is correct. 50% hashpower means you have a 50% chance to get the next block. It also means you can sustain by yourself a duplicate blockchain with the same speed as the network. It doesn't have to be perfectly 50%, but you if manage to get slightly more than 50%, you statistically can reach 6 blocks before the other network and propagate your chain as the truth, including the confirmed transactions, thus invalidating the work and transactions in the other chain. With 45%, you get 9 in 10 chances for each block to be ahead of the other network, so after 6 blocks you have 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 53% on first try. But you also get several tries.

**The few academic papers done on Bitcoin are of low quality and the authors always demonstrate lack of knowledge on the subject.** It is maybe possible that they are unable to either understand it completely to formulate real discussions on it, or they find no flaw or improvement to discuss. You can review the papers and their reviews to find a paper where the authors understand what Bitcoin is.
The userbases involved in Bitcoin and torrents are also disproportionate, and Bitcoin can be used to operate an identical financial service as existing electronic networks. People don't see the supplemental utility as they did with torrents (improved distribution and lack of censorship).

Each new coin that is minted has a value proportional to the costs of minting. This ensures maximum efficiency if cost = value. It's fair and efficient, and was designed like this by Satoshi. Also the fees should be proportional to the cost of obtaining them. Again, cost = value.

There are also early miners that have 50 BTC split across thousands of addresses, and even current holders (like the 111111 address and mtgox change) that split their coins across hundreds of addresses.
At the same time, exchanges can also combine, or split their holdings, without matching individual holders.
Don't forget that there are wealthy individuals or companies that control trillions of dollars, such individuals could live many lives by the end of this earth and still have some change left over. Such is the nature of wealth distribution.

What this means in numbers, is that the small number of blocks found per day (1/20) times the small fees the pool keeps as profit (less than 1/100), is pretty small compared to a few reward blocks being hijacked via those attacks, such that the loss can be recouped in weeks or months (18 days for a single block reward).

Currently pool operators are in two categories:

You get rich by doing nothing. That is not actually possible, without someone creating real value, transaction fees drop due to competition and the value of the coin drops. Everyone does nothing and receives nothing, meanwhile PoW miners sell energy for fees. If a PoW miner stops investing, he will get fewer and fewer new coins and become irrelevant. If a PoS miner does nothing, he just becomes richer and richer and at some point, by doing nothing, someone will hold 50%+ of the coins, as you can assume that's really bad.
Also, if you don't stake your coins, because you might actually want to use them, you lose value compared to the stakers which get extra coins at no value (see above). So the whole system rewards doing nothing and punishes doing anything useful.
What would you prefer:
* deflationary coin that holds it's value and more and can be spent in less than 1 hour
* inflationary coin that loses value or can't be used outside careful planning

* double-spends from clones impossible
* cards can be used globally and with any other provider
* can be dumped to a piece of paper and back
* works on any type of computer with internet
* worldwide 99.99% uptime 
* joint accounts
* no transfer limits
* no use limits

* spend p2p in person or over the internet
* recharge remotely
* receive/send from/to anyone anywhere in the world

I was curious if the production price reached market price yet (because something happens at that point). Basically I used the network speed and  the optimal numbers for recent miners on this form: 
Whole network speed * average power usage * average power cost / total btc hour = average btc cost
Total network speed can be found here: 
Remember that historically miners expected to sell a bitcoin at double production price to cover equipment costs, maintenance, interest, taxes, fees and other operational costs. At this moment it covers just the electricity cost, network speed will decrease or decelerate and inefficient miners will exit the market.

With just 2, they could do it every 3 hours at a cost of 5000 USD. Notice the difference? It's hugely important.

This is factored into the difficulty algorithm. Miners are on a 0% profit. Reward halves. They are at a -50% profit now. They drop out, reducing their costs to 0%, thus the profit is higher than -50%. Difficulty adjusts in 2016 blocks to -40%. Miners resume mining if this is profitable.
Around one month of negative profits will need to be sustained, after which it's business as usual.
OR, the bitcoins are held and prepared to be sold for higher prices. There are many factors to consider, but once started, Bitcoin can only die if a high percentage of the hashing power goes offline.

I don't know where you get the data, but technically there are blocks that will never be able to be filled with more transactions than they already contain. 
There are 1 tx blocks where the miner is unable to build a full block of verified transactions while the work jobs return a valid block solution for an blank block (the miners need to put real confirmed valid transactions which need to account for the just released previous block, and before that, the pool distributes hashing jobs for a blank block, which may return solutions with 25 BTC rewards instead of 25.5 BTC, the pool starts mining at 1 second after the block but the solution is found by a miner after some seconds)
There are also 750Kb blocks which the miners CHOOSE to limit to that size and which will never be larger until they choose a different size.
As long as people keep lying to others that the "blocks are not full yet, see?" using these never fillable exceptions, then everyone will not comprehend the reality of the situation.
 - **100 blocks, 5 blocks with partial fills**, all the rest are over 90% filled to their intended capacity.
The ratio is more towards 5% than 42% as presented in the title...

No. Your node only counts if you are a miner, an exchange or a service provider. Every other node is fluff and doesn't actually matter, it's just make belief, your "decentralized" raspberry node is a bitch to a Chinese miner node with large mining capacity, because your node doesn't have a say in which transactions get processed, it will accept whatever the miners publish even if your node disagrees.
So the question is: **do you agree if the blocks are naturally bigger as bitcoin is adopted, the number of useful nodes drop?**
Answer that if you can. I'll help if you need more information. I have to say it will actually increase.
Or you could answer this: **If the sky didn't fall when we progressed from 500kb blocks to 1000kb blocks, then why will it fall if we progress to 2000kb blocks?**

You need 500-1000 extra blocks to prevent reversibility, double spends and orphaned rewards being used for valid transactions. It takes 20-30 seconds for a blockchain network to be 99% in sync. What happens when two nodes find blocks 2 seconds later before they know another note already found the block? You also need 1000 more disk source and computing costs to maintain the network.

No, I can't actually. Because it's quite simple to understand (or alternatively you will never understand even if it's simple).

I just blocked non-large (rational) institutions. You won't be able to send your Bitcoin directly (as promised in the whitepaper), instead you will opt for a centralized service to merge several transactions with a single large fee, while taking medium fees from individual transactions and pocketing the difference.
Think an analogy between sending money by envelope, versus using Western Union. In both cases it might cost the same for you, but Western Union only needs to settle maybe once in a while with a big bag of money. "Give us the money to "send" it over, you can pay "less" for this service, thank you for the profits!".
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:51:16
Let's see...
* Adam Back spends 2+ hours on Twitter every day to complain about what the other devs (mostly Mike+Gavin) say, and some unmeasured time on Reddit, instead of shilling positively for his projects, which I assume he might be working on... or not.
* Luke Dashjr keeps complaining that the block is too large, 90% of the legitimate fee-paying intentional transactions are spam and should be blacklisted, and spends his time proposing optimizations for Bitcoin to work on Tor over 56kbit modems when clearly we have better technology.
* Peter Todd pushes his destructive and damaging replace-by-fee patches so we can't have 0-conf anymore and complains that 1Mb blocks are too big also. In his vision, Bitcoin should be very slow and very expensive to use, when we clearly can do better.
Legitimate developers are having their opinion drowned in this whole gaggle and then there are people like say "oh, ALL the devs are clearly against, because you don't hear them supporting the increase".  So this whole "core developers" bunch is now a circus waiting to be standardized by someone with patience and financial interest.
There are risks and problems with moving forward in Bitcoin, but if we deny all risks and avoid all problems in this manner, Bitcoin will die to something better (unless the clowns break it by then). Remember that this community wants features and adoption. There are 2000+ altcoins, there's Ethereum, there's popular support of Bitcoin adoption, don't ignore the fact that Bitcoin is useless without users.

It is possible to use even [some 4$ options]( as long as there's some RAM. However without SSD storage, the node will freeze up resources for 5-10 seconds each time a block is received. This time is reduced to 1-2 seconds on SSD, helping block propagation (the node is marginally useful for the network, not only the owner).

Seeing the other replies, this thread has pretty much covered the involved factors. It is also possible to have two Bitcoins, or more. But just Bitcoin being open source has been cloned multiple times, even with improvements, the original network and structure is still the leader, both in popularity and security. Sure, you can keep a few dollars in an alternative coin, but Bitcoin, the official one, will be the most secure version.

Transaction count went down. Transaction complexity went up. Bigger and fewer transactions save up resources such as disk usage but increase network usage instead. You can divide the size by the count on Tradeblock to see an average size. Smallest tx is 250 bytes, average is 450 bytes.

I don't follow your logic, I refer to the Bitcoin whitepaper, the software implementation and the observed network behavior. There can be only one unique individual block at each block height in the Bitcoin blockchain. There is no life raft. There is only a rollback which is only possible for small time periods like a few hours at best (a hard fork carries heavy damage to the value, economy and trust of Bitcoin). Consider the effects of a 75/25 split of the mining power at an arbitrary block number and see how things evolve. Look into over 2000 altcoins and what happened to them in similar conditions (hint: there were many hard forks, forced rollbacks, dead blockchains, mining attacks).
There is always Litecoin, and if you don't like that, then maybe Dogecoin? Very life, much raft, such safety, very wow!

You can't be sure of that. Given the difficulty adjustment mechanism, I can organize a passive mining attack, that follows all the rules, but what I obtain is an artificial 40% difficulty increase for the next 2 weeks. The only problem is, I pull out my hashing power, and now that chain will take 3 weeks to return to normal block confirmation frequency, in which time the quality of service is reduced.
We can also dedicate a third of the power on the heavy chain and do a 51% attack by producing hidden blocks and releasing them after a few hours, effectively un-confirming ALL transactions. Every day of the week.
So now the lighter blockchain suffers from variable quality of service, coupled with longer confirmation times (you might need for example to use the 120 blocks reorg limit as a confirmation (20 hours for immutable transactions). But wait, there's more, it takes 40% longer to confirm those transactions, so now you need to wait 28 hours to make sure you won't get newly received or mined bitcoins taken away.
**~1.3 hours immutable transactions on the heavy chain, ~1.2 days on the light chain.** And it's way worse at the start. You want to bet how many orders of magnitudes cheaper the light chain bitcoins and security will be? Even Litecoin will outperform it's functionality. My snarkiness stems from the fact that you assume your "logical" opinions to be universally applicable and impossible to circumvent, while you still do not accept some of the behaviors that have been proven to exist in contradiction to your suppositions.

It's when you heat it over 200C such that the solder balls become liquid and then cool it back down to solidify the solder on the contacts. The initial soldering system names the factory procedure of soldering the BGA chip as a "flow". When you re-do the procedure it's called a re-flow. The main chip is the big GPU chip that is doing the vector computing and data transfer control.
Basically it's making sure the GPU is attached and connected to the board, in case thermal stress caused disconnects. As each chip has a recommended number of soldering flows, this one can be serviced once more if needed.

Really lowers the costs of hardware ownership to have a re-flow station available. He has dozens of GPUs, memory and northbridge chips thrown all over the desks.

I suppose you can **name something that is universally and perpetually sacred**? I think there is no such thing. Nothing remains sacred across history and cultures. Simply pointing out to a thing that you and X people consider sacred, makes it magically sacred? How?


Good for him. You still did not rebutted my argument that from psychology we know that people prefer to keep their beliefs set and defend them instead of changing them when new information arises, or that people prefer to accept the existence of nice hopeful things instead of ugly bleak realities. May I point at IQ/religiousness charts? How come current day geniuses "with a far greater capacity for reason and logic than you will ever have" are more often non-believers?


Did you choose from a set of religions that exist? Can you make a choice that is not presented or available? Why did other people choose other faiths?


The victim's complex. The arbitrary chance that you are a Christian does not change the fact that you are first a beliver, e.g. a person that puts more value on what people with authority dictate compared to what people with expertise dictate. If you were part of another religion, you would accuse me of "thinly veiled allusions to X_religion_followers", so please don't act offended, I am arguing with a religious beliver. I'm just pointing out it's easier to convince people that DO NOT REQUIRE FACTUAL EVIDENCE that some things are better for them and they should buy them.


"Ilk" :) We're not part of a group you can identify, so you use a derogatory grouping naming, I understand, even if I did not do such things. You say God exists. I say it does not. Is this not black and white? Where do I fail? How can something 81.45% exist? We are quite absolute about it, you say 100%, I say 0%. With such stark contradictions, you do not have shades of gray, especially in our case, your argument is completely off the side. So, as I said. **One of us is wrong**. Ok, **maybe both of us are wrong**. But explain to me how both of us could be right (God universally exists and does not exist at the same time).
This also makes me question your competences in "Logic and reason".


You don't require religion to be a nice person. I can give examples where religious people are not nice to other people specifically because of their beliefs, but I would rather not here.

Not necessarily. Someone has to pay taxes somewhere. The VAT for the laptop will be paid, someone will have to withdraw their local currency to use it to buy other stuff and taxes will be paid, it's just a bit of redirection going on.
Also, if a client wants to pay my employer $1000 so I can do something on his server, my employer will pay income tax, get a share himself, add some profit and insurance parts for the company, then pay his part for my taxes, then I pay my part for my taxes, then I get to spend the money and from $1000 I can only benefit of about $250-$300 value... just because one guy had $1000 to give me a reward for doing something for him.

Very well sir, have a nice day. Remember to be careful when you accuse others of undesirable actions, be sure not to make them yourself.


Wrong. You should check your data, it's the opposite actually.


Not at all, usually in the past before human rights movements, atheist either had to shut up or suffer anything from public humiliation up to race genocide. 


Wrong. Launguage. Much older, much more universal, much more important and much more prevalent, it is the basis of culture, of which religion is just a small part.


Oh but I can. In my country there are about 6-10% atheists in the general population. The recorded census shows about 0.1%. Do you know what happens to atheists that tell their personal beliefs to their peers in my country? Of course not. I dare talk about oppression, it is something real for me.
Yeah, attack some man which has no scope to our discussion, just because you can't form a good argument. Strawman + ad hominem + red herring much?


Really, well I can touch the ground, I can feel the air, but for the last 25 years, I neither touched, seen, smelled, hear or felt anything else but what was part of nature. Where is God exactly?! If he exists he must be found somewhere. That's the definition of "exists". Surely us atheists must be horribly broken if we are unable to go and touch God like you can.


Yours definitely are. For example for me, if it exists, it can be found. Does the ground you walk on exist? Yep, you can go out and touch it. Do gods exist? Nope, they only exist as ideas and concepts, nobody can go out in the world and find a god manifesting itself. Oh, some people hijack the words for other processes and phenomena that exists, and call it God, sure, that could work too, it is untruthful though.


Yes, I can point to a documented process called democratic election, part of democracy, and show you the events, documents, and results of this process. I wouldn't call this process God, because it isn't. 


I have the same feeling as you. There are so many misconceptions religious people tell each other and then proceed to ignore evidence to the contrary. You trying to use logic to explain emotions is like you trying to use a measuring cup to explain the depth of Shakespeare. You think it works, it doesn't. Use the right instruments.


I went to college, there was no indoctrination course across all faculties, or I must have missed it. Even so, younger populations are more atheistic. Naturalistic sciences are not inherently anti-religious or atheistic, they just explain things as they can be determined, without extra fluff.


I used to buy ONLY nVidia cards up to this year, becuase of purely technical and utilitarian reasons. Starting this year I ONLY recommend ATI cards because they are now better in terms of technical details and utility. I used to recommend only AMD architectures, 3 years ago I switched to Intel and only consider it to be the best generic or specific option. My choices have changed because I determined my needs or my peers' needs are best satisfied by a certain product specs. You believe I am lying when I write this now.


Nothing is sacred. You can't provide an example of a sacred thing, only examples of what YOU think is sacred, thus making sacredness a subjective opinion.


No, I am not aware of this. I never stumbled on such information, nor was it in my previous discussions. I will look into it.


What changed your mind?
Anyway, nothing you said was new or original, it's all the same apologetics I hear all day from people who have special emotional needs without which they can't feel empowered and superior (religious spirituality). Good luck with that. Don't waste your time debating religious culture in this subreddit, there are better ones.

It applies to specific uses where "truth" is accepted as a majority of past options and an agreement is put forward as the new "truth". It doesn't work when the truth is decided outside the bitcoin network with outside rules, such as would be the case of an "attack". You can't decide the color of the sun, or the speed of light with this algorithm, it applies pretty well to bitcoin, including a model with limited peer connectivity. According to theory, even with just 6-8 connections, anyone should be at around 6 peers distance from anyone. Also peers that are not actively mining should be transaction agnostic in the case of transactions that don't apply to them, thus lowering bandwidth. You are approaching the problem with a very strict belief of what should happen and you don't allow for the possibility of a viable self-moderating system with less resources than ideal.
There are currently 63 trasactions waiting to be processed in the next block:  (the number will be most likely different when you visit the site). These transactions will be irrelevant in the network as they will soon be stored into a block. This also means your back and forth "attack" will be split up every 10 minutes into smaller problems. You are also forgetting that "newly received funds" require transactions fees, such that you would need to wait for an hour after you used up all your coins to initiate another attack. You might also run into transaction size fees and you might only bother your client and your other bitcoin client by abusing the technique you describe on HN. When bitcoin becomes so popular that it would create 2000 transactions per second (you must be forgetting the existence of online wallet services and other p2p overhead reduction services), surely some progress would be made in terms of storage space, network speeds and processing power.
In conclusion, trying to go mad in terms of hashing power will result in a huge monetary loss, and trying to go mad in terms of peer abuse will result in bitcoin loss.

It's nowhere near that, even with 2000 transactions a second. If transactions are what they are today in size, and if they really need a whole network packet for all purposes (1500 bytes), then each active online node would need to receive about 2.8Mb/s and be aware of all transactions made in real time, thus a monthly 7Tb.
There are just 2000 transactions every FOUR HOURS now. Some serious time must pass before we get from 15000 seconds to 1 second.

Deepbit can only double-spend once. Even if the wallet addresses can be anonymized, the source of the spent bitcoins would be unique. A double-spend would destroy deepbit, give someone double the transferred bitcoins (while the sender only loses the send coins), and everyone flees and never returns to deepbit.
Since deepbit now lost the lead on the network majority, the network was not accepting deepbit's blocks and instead using valid blocks, the situation will default to normal, with damage done to the people that had transactions during the forked period (they would need to re-do them).
How many hours do you think deepbit can control more than 50% of the network when it takes 10 minutes to notice something bad is happening? How much do you think Tycho will forfeit in potential profits by attempting to go rogue?

Yes, I was pointing out it's impossible to predict what the difficulty increase will be after the next difficulty increase. As you can see in the graph, it can even go down, while on average it has a steady increase.
The point is: All these variables offer completely different outputs in the future and we can't predict or trust any of them. Thus it is not possible to offer advice by selectively agreeing that one variable will behave like you want it to. Mining profitability will vary wildly because it depends on each of those variables, and so far it has proven that on average, with average hardware and electricity prices, the instant value of mined bitcoins is lower than the market prices, thus profitable.

OKCoin for example does not have throttling or trading suspension. That's the thing about Bitcoin, it's 24/7, there are some things that go bad when you suspend trading. Other exchanges might have price triggers to limit trading, but not OKCoin.
When someone gets liquidated, the price moves further, someone else gets liquidated, price moves further, some else is caught, and so on. A 5% price swing required for the first liquidation is extended to 8-9% on the 20X margin.
Then the 10X margin call sits at 10%, and if it goes into that, the whole side of the wall is blown up completely. And everyone seems to be ok with that, because gambling...
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:04:52
You are correct, however I was in a -120% position yesterday and did not get liquidated. That's because I had available funds to cover the margin risk, it went below the margin call (which was calculated at -85% btw) and now it's salvageable. Nobody can call you in a 3 minutes FOMO swing to ask you to please send more bitcoins. You either have it or not. You get liquidated or not, there is no time or mechanism on most bitcoin bucket shop exchanges to prevent liquidation when a margin call should apply.

How can I be helpful if you first ask stupid question without reading fucking 5 minutes of information posted everyday on the forum, this subreddit and the wiki, that clearly answers your question, and then you call me out for being a jerk.
Here's the answer: default bitcoin generation rate is 50 per 10 minutes at this point in time. The wiki and wikipedia article has a chart about future generation rates. You can see every block in existence, including generation time here:  . You can see the actual statistical generation rate of the last 1000 blocks here:  .

Streamium is an on the fly paywalled synchronous unscalable application that allows peer to peer streaming with enforced time pay.
Outside of the above sentence, you have issues. You can't upstream to 200 viewers at once, not even on Romanian internet speeds. Viewers can't see even a screencap of what the content is about, it has to be prepared in advance. You can't change gears. You can't cater to the long tail, or the top donors. You can't enforce a minimum time spend.
The camgirls can even start streamium, put a tiny price and stream there as well. But then, you know their IP, their location, and that is a huge issue with privacy and security. **There are thousands of horny sociopaths out there, ready to creep and stalk these girls, you're just giving them an invitation to harass even better**...

I am split between allowing a compromise of ideas so as not to appear a militant atheist and explaining that **reality cannot conform at once to two distinct and exclusive models**. Consider the bitcoin equivalent of a blockchain split. While both chains would suggest they are the true one, looking back from the future it would be clear that one was absolutely wrong.
Would it be a dick move if an ultra-nationalist was putting anti-racial slurs in the blockchain? Or any representative of a philosophy/lifestyle/policy/group not dear to you? Do you think I agree that the textual responses to the latin scripts made by offended people are superior in any way or form? It's all about bias perception, or should we say lack of, which makes us find ways to reassure ourselves we are the top man in the Universe. Did he think that this could offend someone? If he did, did he do it on purpose knowing he would be offensive? Wouldn't that make him a dick, if he intentionally put in effort to offend the majority of a community known to be irreligious according to forum polls and generic profiling? Or maybe he did as an art statement, like poor quality graffiti doodling... 
Also, I often stopped eating or drinking stuff I loved after finding bitter mouth-fulls, not to mention socializing with certain people or going to certain places. Yes, you can be compelled to change your opinion of something based on new information that proves your assumptions were wrong, I do it all the time, thus I had to declare myself an atheist.

I understand "paid" as in the pool sends actual bitcoins into my public address. To do that, it should be at least 1000 satoshi (or more) otherwise I would pay expensive fees when attempting to spend this later. As such, you are not able to receive "satoshis" instantly.
Furthermore, the presented hashrate should provide about 0.00001766 BTC per hour, you would need 6 hours of mining to scrounge up enough to pay a single normal priority transaction fee. And probably you want at least that to actually DO something with the collected bitcoin.

* 200.000.000 USD is huge -- no it's not, there are over 1 million users, surely it is impossible for them to each share 200 USD of resources with the project you say
* APPEARED -- yeah, yesterday you did not knew about it, now you do. Question: how "HUGE" is the drug market in the world. Do you have any idea of the number? Clearly you don't know about it. What about the US Army. Do you know how much their hardware is worth and how much it eats every year. I'll tell you: HUGE
* OUT OF THIN AIR -- end of argument. **You show that you clearly do not understand bitcoin, will not understand bitcoin and will actively prevent yourself by all means from understanding bitcoin, your brain is just like that**. First you say out of thin air, then you say you made a small investment, which shows yourself contradicting alot. Maybe you get electricity out of thin air too... Kewl, huh?

You are entitled to not agree, for example I note two facts that the article fails to correctly discuss and accept:
1. *Abstract: problem for which there is no known solution: creating consensus in a group with open, changing membership*. This is the whole summary of the article, and it completely misses the fact that the whole network uses an arbitration algorithm called the** [Byzantine General's Problem]( See? No problem in reality.
* *the mechanism by which these checkpoints are established must use some other form of consensus, and one which is robust over time*. **What is difficulty adjustment?**

Consider using trading APIs like this: 
You will be able to get the current bitcoin value, list it on your website, obtain the dollar equivalent instantly, then place a trade order to convert the bitcoin into dollars (if you are worried about fluctuations, which can work to your advantage 50% of the time). Over many transactions you will afford one bad drop, and may even be interested in holding onto the bitcoins for a while and manually placing exchange orders for a better rate. 
And of course don't forget that as more businesses accept bitcoin, you can simply perform B2B payments with those bitcoins.

Yes.

It was at 30$ and now it's at 20$ because someone decided to crap on everyone else while cashing out (he could have managed his sellout better, but instead **he dumped 300.000$ worth of bitcoins on the public market** causing a price swing because lots of idiots that don't understand or trust the principles panicked). Now did it lose 2/3rds of it's value? 30 / ( 3 * 2 ) = 20?

Lul, it's all these bitcoin haters...
Yes, you could clone a wallet and double spend from two machines at the same time, the same sum. There would be a 50% chance that the merchant's client would get the fair transaction listed. There is also a chance of 50% that the unfair transaction reaches the next block miner first. Thus, in 1/4 cases you can broadcast a fair transaction to your merchant, while that transaction will not be included in the next block. And in 1/4 of the cases your transaction doesn't reach the merchant at all (because he sniffed the unfair one first). The other 1/2 cases it's a gray area.
Either way, first confirmation of a payment should take about 5 minutes on average, sufficient time for you to act like you paid your bill and skip, but also not such a long time to wait inside the restaurant to make sure you paid your bill.

The governments need tight control on taxing, such that they get the right share of taxes. Sometimes they know that the black market, evasion and non-traceable transactions can occur without providing the required taxes.
The governments cover all angles, effectively imposing transactions at each step, most of the time asking too much.
Then the governments may offer tax rebates, tax deductions and other benefits to compensate fair providers. 
As examples you can deduct VAT from your taxes if you use the funds for purchases, you can deduct income tax if you provide to charity and for activity in certain sectors you may get refunds and rebates for doing the government's work or actively promoting it's programs (clean energy). Sometimes if you are unable to afford taxation, the guvernment allows subsidies for age groups and handicapped people.
This is all too complicated at face value. I understand the taxation law book in the USA has over 10.000 pages of rules and exceptions. Some of these can be reduced where they overlap or cancel eachother, but instead americans have to dance the dance, give money in advance and receive it interest-free later, a pointless exercise but profitable for the state again.
So who profits from the state? Oh nobody, just the 15-25% of workers that do not provide free market goods or services and instead serve themselves and the citizens.

2. Why do I have to wait so long to buy something? Usually with stock websites, you can buy from your existing credit, or pay within seconds. With bitcoin you need to wait around 5 minutes and hope that the things in the previous point don't happen...

Ah, there we go, I was scared of what kind of reply I would get. There is always hope you may discover something "extraordinary" in life, so I had to ask to make sure this is the case. Now I'll say a few things, because you gave a typical reply and even if nobody reads this, we know the important people do:
I'm glad this works out for you and my only wish is for you to feel happy about your choices, new identity and behavior without the need to downplay other people that made choices different than yours. Nobody pushed their religious agenda on you, it happened to you because you seek it out, therefor there is no reason to tell people they are wrong, or close-minded and blame them for not seeing things your way when they are deprived of the experiences you had.
Secondly, I hope you agree with me that some people are generally too weak to motivate themselves (I am guilty of this to some extent) and may require substance use just so their brains forces them to do at least some effort to procure said substances, but still unable to escape their economical and social situations. These people require some form of emotional spirituality and social acceptance to function normally. The exact type and nature of the spirituality and social group is irrelevant as long as people respect each-other and provide desirable goals in life. I too had a period of downturn, but recently found a group of nice people that adopted me in their group, they are very helpful with everyone and it gives me the same feeling to do the same. They are less religious than the rest of the population and we all have fun at group parties but a general sense of openness and happiness is present. Many people have told me this happens in reality, but I never found it by myself. I don't deny that accepting social groups increases self worth and makes us better people in part and in society, I can't call any part of this or attribute this to deities because it can be explained scientifically.
Thirdly, your description of extraordinary statistical chances that lead you to believe is not impressive to me at all, it's something I would expect from someone overwhelmed by emotions over reason. I'm sorry, natural and possible events don't phase me, as much as unlikely they are to happen. Giving away money and resources is thoroughly documented to stimulate dopamine secretion, the hormone of happiness, in greater quantities than the more common food satisfaction and sexual satisfaction activities. Not only you feel good but you ignore the bad aspects of life and try to give uplifting interactions to your peers. This is why donating or tithing is a positive thing to do. Even atheists advocate this. This is why I started collecting money and chip in with some friends every Christmas for the past 3 years and we organize a visit to an orphanage or poor neighborhood with presents and supplies for the children. I give away about of 2% of my yearly income for this event. It's not much, I wish I could collect more, but my income is quite stretched now. Yes, tithing works, it's a perfectly natural social phenomena, there are not many unknowns here, I can't call any part of this or attribute this to deities because it can be explained scientifically.
About the spending part, it's easy, there is a known and documented process where personal expenses expand to match personal income. No matter how much money you make, you will always manage to spend it all. This is human nature, trying to be optimal about utility obtained from resource usage. I would say the whole life kingdom does this, as populations with supplemental resources just increase in numbers faster to use up these resources. There is nothing magical about putting money in a savings account, donating it, investing it, sharing it with someone, and then always spending the rest that remains, such that any kept surplus will be wasted immediately. I can't call any part of this or attribute this to deities because it can be explained scientifically.
Good people will always be good people, no matter what their chosen religion is, but sometimes good people turn to dicks based on strict religious dogmas. I really hate that. This is why we are talking, right? I hope you can read and study other views about what you just wrote, it certainly won't harm you in any way to learn more, will it?
@_date: 2011-06-15 12:08:59
I think the bitcoin network has a hashing power higher than the top 500 computers "all joining up together"....
- Network total	6.498 Thash/s (or around 108 PFLOPS)
- Top 500 computers in 2010: 34 PFLOPS
Scary? Yes.
And depending on electricity cost (not minding the hardware) you would need to pay 9000$ every hour you want to keep the attack (until the rest of the network capitulates or reduces dramatically). Also you can only spend bitcoins you already own (even if you do it repeatedly). And if you stop, the honest network might invalidate your transactions, you need to somehow cash out fast. But how?

Because it's not. The direct energy cost to bind each bitcoin is about 1.5$ at the current state.

Issues that do not require programming:
- online encrypted wallets need offline keys, if you lose the offline keys you lose the online wallet, it's just the same as the current wallet, there is nothing useful for this application
- reputation system - game-able, every website owner should implement their system, look at reddit and stackoverflow toget a sense of how to do it
- exchange - not a programmer issue
- secondary market - what?
- mining pool - plenty of, the problem with pools is they are too small to start at first, but then when they become bigger the infrastructure has issues not the design
Programmers can make other stuff:
- widgets for websites
- applications for web platforms
- applications for mobile platforms (check out some huge bounties btw)
- automated trading platforms for mtgox
- shopping cart extensions for magento/ubercart/ecommerce
- websites

Sure, but if that money is Bitcoin, it seems to be harder and more expensive to obtain recently...
@_date: 2011-07-01 12:48:25
Buying in is also an option. However a buy-in is 100% risk, while buying hardware carries a smaller risk (you can resell/reuse hardware for about 70-80% of it's value). Also, with a limited financial power, you can buy a limited quantity of bitcoin. With mining hardware, you can mine endlessly (in theory) and even if you have just 10% more bitcoins to mine on your less than shiny hardware, that 10% could be worth more than the other 90%. So to conclude:
* Buying 100 bitcoins with cash gives you 100 bitcoins forever.
* Buying 100 bitcoins worth of mining hardware gives you 100+ bitcoins in less than 2-3 months plus valuable mining hardware.

If you have a website and you list your wallet ID, don't change it and publish the list of transactions from blockexplorer, you could comment on each transaction and mention what you bought and for whom, as a way to build testimonials and create a reputation count.
I live in another country, you couldn't buy stuff for me. Maybe a website that allows members to locally trade products for bitcoins where bitcoin owners post whishlists...

Do you know you can rent 1000 botnet nodes for 100$ a day? e.g. your proposed example would fetch 10.000 USD a day, or 300.000 a month. Why would you mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-07-04 11:57:24


**I choose to stop this discussion.** You are clearly out of all bounds with your estimates. As you can probably see, [average transaction size is below 500 bytes]( So I can safely assume that 2000 transactions would need 500 bytes of data, plus another bit up to 1500 bytes before network packets fragmentation occurs, which translates to 2.8Mb/s. Where did you pull the 1Gb/sec value?


I don't know what killed Gnutella (besides government agencies crackdown and fake users flooding the network with crap and malware), but again, **not all nodes need to see all transactions**. They only need to have all blocks, [which are 23kb in size]( and appear every 10 minutes.

First find out how much you can compute:
*  (requires FF4.0+ and a plugin to be installed)
*  (same perf as above, requires deepbit account)
*  (official cpu client, click generate coins)
Run them on each PC, and add up the resulting Mhash/s numbers. These are just for testing, better alternatives later. Then go to 
* 
And enter the details: hash rate, time frame (put 1 month), electricity rate, power consumption (65W for CPU, 150W for GPU), generated coins (50 for your own server if you have more than 500Mhash/s, 47-49 if you use mining pools).
Click compute, receive answer to all questions above.

Use flags on the miners to increase responsiveness. For example **-f 30** will split the works in 30 frames per second, such that other applications can perform graphic updates. Also aggression flags and process priority (both the miner process and your browser) will prioritize resources differently, allowing you even to play FPS games while still using half the hash power from a GPU.

Definately looks better. Any filesystem or application encryption software helps every tiny bit. However you still need backup, a clean environment when accessing the encrypted content (otherwise you get stolen from when your guard is down), and there are some free options that might interest you such as Truecrypt.
Personally I use 7zip to encrypt the wallet, and Wuala and Dropbox to store them online. Anyone can get them and I don't care, I only open the wallets in a Linux VM that doesn't have any new software, and only after I use the password.
@_date: 2011-06-26 12:08:03

This is the most efficient mining option available for me. The in-browser mining is about 70-80% efficient and uses only the CPU. Other pools are either too big (smaller payouts) or too small (unreliable payouts) for me.

* WHO is using Streamium at this very second to stream content?
* How can I find camgirls that Stream for bitcoin so I can have a wank, is there a directory of some sort?
* How can I preview the content before making sure I am giving payment to the right channel?
* How can I find viewers for my channel once I start streaming?
* How can a streamer organize multiple viewers to be online at the same time?
* How can I give MORE bitcoins to a streamer than the set rate?
* How can the streamer provide a free stream or change rates easily?
* Why is Streamium practically better for the internet users, except for the extra **buzzwords** pumped around?
* **Why is nobody working to make an Xotika clone that blows the centralized site out of the water, since using Streamium is obviously better?**
* Why are you stuck up your ass and can't understand the difference between ideology and pragmatism?
* Why do you think you are promoting something so amazing that the world has not seen since sliced bread, when it's just a combination of simple Webrtc browser support and simple bitcoin transactions?
* Why write disingenuous titled threads with false accusations like "PSA: in the last few days, someone has been spamming a (probably fraudulent, or at least very dishonest) proprietary webcam streaming site advertisements to and downvoting any mentions of an open-source decentralized alternative"

It also appears to me that the value of bitcoins is going up, so even if you get fewer in the same cost and time period, they are worth the same.
The consensus on the forums is if mining doesn't work that well, just buy some, the price will go up until mining becomes worth it again.
Also, the price might not go over 14$/BTC (at the current difficulty) as you could just rent out Amazon Tesla instances and mine at this price for a whole year, without even paying for hardware.

Sorry for my late reply:
1. So are you.
2. Bullshit.
3. I upvote things I want people to see. However I downvote spam or lame excessive shilling. Remember when Streamium launched? Everyone was upvoting that and downvoting some other camsite that "accepted" bitcoin.
Now to be clear, your problem is with you. There are three things that should be separate in your mind:
1. **Peer to peer**: it means that the operation is conducted between the first and second person without a third person.
2. **Centralized/Delegated**: it means two parties use a third party for cost reduction and efficiency, trading in privacy and control.
3. **Decentralized**: a system that is reliable and robust with freedom of choice between any of the third parties.
You are confusing these terms gravely. Looking at Streamium (holy shit you write Streamium so much, you might think they pay you loaves of bread for every time you write it), you will notice that it is a centralized service with peer to peer delegation. **It's exactly Skype.** 
*You connect to a central server. Then you trust that server to hold your escrow wallet and details about your upstream. Then when your peer arrives, on the same server that they trust their funds with, you both connect to a NAT tunneling service to establish a reverse proxy connection for data transfer. For every new client, another upstream link is established through the NAT punching service. So Streamium has actually two centralized services.*
**Now the only difference between this and Xotika is this: there is no peer to peer upstream.** That's it. You open a wallet on Xotika and Streamium. You broadcast your channel details in a directory or directly to viewers on both sites. You have viewers connect to both sites. You have viewers paying the server wallet in both sites. You have the server wallet pay your wallet after the streaming is done, on both sites. A fee is kept by the server on both sites. They are virtually identical except for these differences: Xotika has a high quality video re-transmission server that can't be done by regular streamers, there is a directory, you can check the merchandise before you pay, the pay is unrestricted and voluntary, the participants are protected against each-other off the platform and are pseudo-anonymous.
Streamium is not decentralized. Bitcoin is decentralized. Tor is decentralized. IRC is decentralized. Zeronet is decentralized. The Internet is decentralized. Streamium is not. Without it's central server of NAT punching service it won't work and those are not present on any of the peer.
Xotika is centralized. It can be made peer to peer or decentralized, no doubt. It requires however, just like Bitcoin some delegated streaming servers, a technology that has one negative aspect: lag. The number one enemy of chatting/gaming/streaming is lag. You can't reliably get rid of that without optimal hardware and software.

There was a lot of flammable material in that fire, I know it's easy to point to it and claim any miner farm can end like that, but I'm not convinced. There's not much to burn in a miner, the boards are glass, the heat-sinks are aluminum and the cables usually self-extinct themselves (charred cables are the most common fault in our farm).
Again, wetting ASIC miners is a really bad idea, it takes days/weeks to dry them out and fans/capacitors will get damaged. They would require solvent cleaning to remove the new dirt (dust+water) then lubrication of the fans and re-testing of the components that have capacitors (voiding warranty). A costly and lengthy procedure, it's best to just insure and scrap them if a fire happens.

What is irrelevant is your detailed explanation given by emotion and not careful reading, as I mentioned the 3:1 reward-risk ratio. That is, one winning trade is averaged to be three times larger than a losing trade. If a trading position offers a less ideal ratio or a lower than expected chance, it is not executed. The many TA indicators combine and suggest possible statistical scenarios and clear up some of the uncertainty.

Bitcoin (Bitgold) is specifically designed to mimic the 30 year old gold mining cycle and this is alluded by Satoshi in several emails. The emission schedule, the difficulty system, the exhaustion of remaining supply, the disruption of complacency after each halving, the race for optimization before each halving, and many others, are from direct observations on the gold industry.
If you were a trader, you would know that Bitcoin is traded by time, not by price, you wouldn't make such horrible conclusions about the market cycles.

You understand correctly. But if he doesn't operate the economy, the bitcoin won't increase in value. The value we enjoy today, is only possible by the potential gain losses made months ago by our predecessors. If nobody moves, nothing changes. If everyone moves, everyone gains. It's a new system, and of course it will have different behaviors.
Btw, you can put money in a bank, with interest, and do nothing, and have it valuate. Instead of you know, investing, risking, working with it and not gaining as much, or worse, losing.

Someone posted this earlier: 
You have 4 possible scenarios of local parameters:
- low difficulty, low price: trading as usual
- low difficulty, high price: miners start putting hardware online -&gt; difficulty increases -&gt; profitability shrinks
- high difficulty, low price: miners stop hardware and exit -&gt; difficulty reduces -&gt; profitability returns
- high difficulty, high price: trading as usual
In the history of Bitcoin, the low difficulty high price scenario is more abundant, but you can see after August 2011 how the network reduced in power after a major price drop. Following that, there were other events during that year that can be observed.
The mining factor below is the variable you need to look after. When it hits lows, miners stop mining, buy coins, or both. Because it is cheaper to obtain them by buying instead of paying for energy and hardware. Not all miners, because a small portion of them affect the market sufficiently to drive the price back up. Also there is a lag between the moment it becomes unprofitable and the moment miners give in. The price can not go below certain thresholds.
When the mining factor hits highs, even dedicated miners start selling the coins and buy new hardware, saturating the offer and causing the price to drop or remain stable. Again, since bitcoin has not matured, the demand has more effect on the bitcoin value and cost. Because there are stashes of bitcoin available purchased at low prices, the price can not go above certain thresholds.

Those fees are on the fiat side. SEPA costs the same no matter the sum, so if you have 5000 USD you're better, but the bank takes it because it handles your money. OKPay takes less, just like Dwolla. Bitinstant takes 1% plus 2.5% for VISA/MC, because the money receiver pays VISA/MC for the priviledge of cashless transactions. Paypal and WU take maybe larger cuts of 3.5% to 7%. You know, they take those because they allow you to move, use and manage real currency.
Compare that to BTC exchanges that take at most 0.6%, bitcoin network fees (if any required) of 0.0005 BTC, no "accounting fees", instant payments, etc. 
The fees are much much smaller, aren't they? And compare that to currency exchange for fiat, where if you're really rich and really lucky, you pay at least 2% but usually more on the 3% side.

I didn't say the act of mining Bitcoin makes it valuable. I just said it has value because someone wants to buy it and because it has a cost to produce.
Yes, the proof of work is expensive, it gives Bitcoin utility, which might be seen as valuable.
If tomorrow nobody would want bitcoin, it will have no value. But even then there will be historical value, sentimental value, collection value, all sorts of non-utilitarian and non-economical or I might say non-rational values. It will be worth something, as long as the network is running. 
Look at these lists:
* 
* 
So many failed and useless coins, yet they still have a value. They are never going to be worth anything, yet they still have value. As long as there are at least two miners sustaining the network, they can use the tokens they have for something. It's not easy to kill a coin, some have forgotten miners still crunching numbers for them unattended.
I use bitcoin to settle IOUs with my friends. It's instant, correct and exchangeable. After I satisfy an IOU with someone, they don't need to wait for me to give them fiat or something else in return, they can go to someone else and recoup the value. This utility will exist in any cryptocoin possible, and all you need is two mining nodes and a valid blockchain.

I don't know what exactly you are proposing, you're not revealing all the information in your imagined scenario.
First party sends the wallet to a second party, both parties know the public address beforehand, maybe even part of the private wallet.
Now a third party replaces the wallet with a forged version, which boasts the same public address but a different private address?
The second party receives the wallet, loads it and discovers it's empty. Now the second party doesn't know if the first party sent a fake and kept the original, or it was intercepted by a third party, because sure as hell he can tell that the private address can't sign for the public address.
Now both parties check that while the paper was in transit, after it was sent and before it was received, a third party moved the public address funds. So each party knows the following:
* first party knows the wallet was hijacked during transit by a third party, and it was replaced as this can be proven by the second party having the forged item
* second party knows the wallet was hijacked during transit by a third party, and it was replaced as this can be proven by the keys mismatch on the received wallet.
Both parties know the party at fault: the interceptor. Both parties know that the other party did not cheat on them, because the physical item in transit leaves a "paper" trail. The first party can prove they had the real private key, by sharing the now empty wallet completely with the second party. 
Thus they can both agree that a third party was involved, that the first party sent the real and valid wallet, that it was hijacked in transit, and that the second party may or may not have the proof. The second party could of course have falsified the paper they "received" if there was no proof.

And remember how two years ago a penny was about 0.005 BTC? Well now it's 0.0001 BTC. Who knows in 5 years how much it will be worth. At some point, someone will have to "lower" this artificially designed number.

* Can you force sign a transfer from your new change address, since you have it's associated private key?
* Is there a way to determine or post-generate the change addresses if you have the original primary address and private key?
* Are there any clients or options where you can specify a default change address made with a different private key, which happens to be another paper wallet, so you privately collect all change without compromising security or losing money?
* Can the paper wallet algorithm be used to know which addresses will be generated from the private key, and thus sweep them until all used addresses are identified, and have access to all of change?

While today's bitcoin has a value of 100 USD, if you however own some from 12 months ago, those only costed about 2 USD to make. And go back another year, and the coins costed 0.2 USD to make.

Or inflated...

The cycle of life and death continues...
People will expend only a limited quantity of resources to produce bitcoin, with varying profitability. So while the value is completely free-floating and disconnected from any other indicator of value, the value will be closely tied to the mining cost.
When mining costs increase so much that they create economic decisions in miners, the tendency to hold and ask for a higher price or to exit the mining business appears.
When mining costs decrease relative to value, more miners are added to the market, calling for less efficient investments that are still profitable.
Here is a starting point for researching the 4 factors that affect the bitcoin price:

Oh, I imagined I was living in space and needed some dirt. How convenient that you were selling some, thus we can negotiate it's value.
If you want to obtain costs doing something and no rewards, that's your (irrational) choice.
But the example doesn't apply to bitcoin, the majority of miners expect something back for their efforts, unlike you. They are actually controlling supply based on their mostly rational decisions and efforts.

At the same time, not all existing coins are available for sale on the market, a minority actually, while the newly minted coins are more often available for sale. Thus the ratio of existing/new coins on the market is biased towards fresh supply.

This is the second "theft" of gold from private citizens that I hear this year. First one was a border control crackdown on a one ton gold transport hidden in the floor of a jeep, confiscated by the police. Now this theft of value. I guess it affects me after all, some bitcoin users affected...
These kinds of news interest me, as to transport bitcoin all you have to do is open a chat, send an email, send a SMS, send it directly, carry a piece of paper.
Using bitcoin to relocate your "cold" storage will never result in such incidents, showcasing one of bitcoin's advantages. 1000kg, 40kg, whatever weight of gold lost is a huge deal to the person that obtained and kept that value. Don't you agree?

It should be automatic, like bitcoin destroyed days calculation, that tell you when and how much of a fee a certain complex or with fresh inputs transaction requires.
And perhaps people bitch about the erosion of freedom, of lack of regulation and control. The developers can give themselves any right or control over bitcoin, maybe slowly so nobody notices, with small increments, and the regular user is unaware.
@_date: 2013-10-14 09:08:26
How can they not control the supply, when 100% of the new coins come from miners? What is your definition of "control the supply"?
The mining difficulty is increasing exponentially by more than 1% a day. It jumped from 1 million to 100 million in less than a year. That is stable for you? Maybe you were thinking about the rate of minting?

Just send her a paper wallet address with the bitcoins inside. Once she finds out how to use it, well, job done...
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:42:21
If the addresses mismatch, then you know the party at fault: the sender. Which you are actually trusting in the first place! If he made the bogus paper, then you have proof of his shenanigans.
The idea was that a third party can attack the stickers system because they are cheaper to get than the value obtained from using them. When you have the address printed and you can check it, you know at that exact second, the exact bitcoin sum in that address. Assuming both parties are trusting eachother (not scamming one another), then you can be sure the transaction can go ahead.
There are always copies of the private key, so during the exchange it is the receiver's duty to transfer his new funds as quickly as possible. Until then, the sender and anyone that has accessed the paper can of course take the funds.

There is a solution for this, not sure if it has been implemented.
* customer pays 0.5 BTC
* transaction doesn't transmit
* customer pays 50 USD instead
* customer hands the TXID and a new wallet address for BTC refund (or keep the same)
* ...
* transaction gets confirmed
* transaction gets reversed by sending from the POS address to the wallet address
With the solution presented above (offline transactions), you can even create a refund transaction BEFORE the payment transaction is confirmed. IF the payment transaction is confirmed, the refund transaction will automatically confirm as well.

Only if you want to sell it and recoup your investment. Would you not put a price on it, even a lower bound?
And then if more than one person was interested in your dirt, would you not hold a public auction or set a markup on this lower price to match demand?

The camera sells today for 15.5 bitcoins. You now take those 15.5 bitcoins and buy new stock, which happens to be about 12 bitcoins. You get a profit of 2 bitcoins, the equivalent of 129 USD.
So now you can sell another camera, and also have 129 USD ontop of the original 1000 USD. Why do you people never follow your analogies through?
I know why. Because we have to learn how to use money all over again. The old system is hundred of years old, this one, just 4.

All of these are impossible, because there is a freaking public address right on that fucker, and you can query it in 2 seconds to see how much money it really has on it.
Nobody can empty the wallet and still have funds according to the public key.
Nobody can be that stupid to believe you when you give them a verifiable empty wallet and claim there's something in it.
The third case might happen depending on the physical aspect. However, the emptying transaction can be proven to be outside of either one of the involved parties, and they won't blame eachother.
Yes, there is no difference. No, your reasons are not applicable.

Please elaborate. A SAN would require disk-only access, however an encrypted disk is useless (assuming he was using one) to capture. You need live memory to collect the encryption key.
For example, if I use dm_crypt (so his server can't be seized and used against him) and log in remotely to boot it up, nobody else can start it. Unless my authentication is recorded by the hoster. Maybe remoting in and mounting an encrypted volume over SSH would make sense.

* The alternative cryptocurrencies will not take Bitcoin's "lion share", they are a small market in comparison
* Since they started later, they will always stay behind and legitimate Bitcoin as the original cryptocoin
Both of these things are the opposite of "threat".

There is a way. A virtualized kernel cannot run as a hypervisor to access it's own hardware-assisted virtualization features. Or something like that.
Also virtualized hardware is different than real hardware and has special drivers with clearly labeled names and behaves differently in software.
Then again there are direct I/O virtualization technologies around. 
Encryption doesn't really help as the private key would need to be in the clear to access encrypted data, most likely in-RAM. So even if the hard drive was encrypted, the key is available if the OS is running.

Yes, they always need money desperately. The business sector is very random, profit rates vary from bust in 2 years up to 60-70% profit per year, so the overall interest rates are higher compared to mature economies.
The central bank sets the "reference interest rate", based on which it will mediate inter-bank trades and corrections. So banks will naturally give up to that figure for deposits, and ask well above it for credits.
At some point in recent years after 2008, interest rates varied from 4% to 17%. Some people have cool 6% fixed rate credits that they can pay, while others enjoy long-term deposits made at 13% interest.

They had help from other agencies and were using the server as web users. Tracking your traffic across the Tor network is possible if you control sufficient peers to narrow down some pathways.
Or maybe they obtained something extra from the server itself that helped them identify the provider. Or they noticed traffic events on the server matching events from certain providers. Imagine they can work with all providers, the only safety you have is they don't know which exact server is yours.

Good question. In laptops, it is usually a solder issue because the laptops heat to 90C or cool down to sometimes freezing temperatures during their lifetime. The mechanical effects on computer parts that undergo usage cycles is documented for tens of years.
And then laptops are even more sensible because they are shocked, warped, pressed, twisted and bent regularly, especially the ones with less metal and more plastic in their cases.
Combined, these two effects cause microscopic fissures in solder and boards, as the chips are individually pretty strong. A silicon chip is very small and sturdy and can't be broken easily. However, the boards are flexible and bend without breaking, the contacts need to be stiff and solid to function, and they will get broken, because the metal alloy in them is soft.
Unless the component has experienced extreme temperatures (above 120C), water/humidity damage, electrostatic or electrical damage, it can most likely be fixed by resoldering. Usually these defects are progressive and vary from artifacts, increased random failures of specific functionality, up to power failure in a laptop when it is physically touched or bent.
Judging by the number of boards fixed/broken in this shop's inventory, I would say 75% of the laptop problems are solved with resoldering, reballing, or chip replacements. The rest are too complex or expensive to fix, so a whole new board is used.

The price doesn't fall to zero, because the miners buy the OTHER coins that exist and those made by other miners. If there are no coins for sale, the price increases until some become available. I will stop the discussion here because I don't think you understand offer and demand.
Me and several other miners want to constantly acquire Bitcoin because they are limited in issue (one of the most important properties of Bitcoin). I intend to constantly buy a certain value of Bitcoin every month, usually through mining. However, I mined because it costs me 75$ to mine a full Bitcoin, instead of 150$ if I take it from another miner. If the price goes below 75$, it is cheaper to buy them than to mint them, and I will pick the cheaper coins to obtain.
If I sell these Bitcoins, which I really want to have, I require a serious reward to part with them. So unless the prices goes above 250$ I won't sell any. But if the price goes above 250$, I might sell some and quickly buy hardware to recover them through mining for example.

Most of the damage to the trust and image of the whole Bitcoin project comes from the uncontrollable swings in price due to various failure points.
* Have you considered replacing your order matching algorithm that has caused the crash from two years ago, or will you continue to use it in the next future crash?
* Will you implement frequency/list limits for open/opening orders?
* Would you accept an algorithm that can group orders to the nearest "pip" and match them in bulk groups instead of parsing each order individually with it's discrete value?
* Will you place stronger limits on posting new orders (or complete stop) when the trade lag reaches one hour (a case where obviously nobody has any control whatsoever over your platform)?
* Will your platform changes still allow people to trade small fractions of a dollar or millions of dollars with the same flexibility as before?

He is right about everything he said, but little does he know about these three aspects:
* Bitcoin eats energy when spawning (it is actually electrical energy converted into heat, quantifiable in other forms of value, helping accelerate the heat death of the Universe). As bitcoin grows in value, so does the mining costs, and the non-digital value sunk into it, thus the value of Bitcoin is based on real resources being destroyed to create it.
* It is a limited set of available tokens composing a global marketplace. As mentioned in the interview, when all tokens are created and then used, Bitcoin will show it's true value. However many tokens are lost and the global marketplace is not mature yet.
* The central authority is "decentralized". Each of us is part of the central authority, manifested as the 51% consensus. We are backing Bitcoin's value by making sure it is regulated (minting process) and secured (transaction checking, forgery prevention) just like a government would.
