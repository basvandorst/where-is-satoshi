Report to security - they take this stuff very seriously. They'll be able to see the activity despite that.

What's the pattern though? I've been reading around and trying to get my own head around the fundamentals.

Happens. Usually when blocks come too fast for the miner to have validated the previous transactions (you can see this was soon after another one). So rather than ditch the block the miner posts with no transactions. "Empty blocks" is the usual term.

*shrug* just what the original designers landed on. You should read the original Bitcoin whitepaper. Good to understand where all this came from.

Bitcoin is designed to mine a block every ~10minutes or so. The difficulty sets how hard it is to mine a block - which effectively sets how long it takes.
As compute power moves in to Bitcoin, this gets faster. Double the hashpower and those 10min blocks take 5 minutes.
Every 2016 blocks, the Bitcoin consensus algorithm looks at how difficult the last two weeks of blocks where. Then it adjusts the rate to try and attain the 10min rate.

It's a 1c trade basically. It's not spam, or at least it's not Bitcoin spam as it's off-chain - they only hit GDAX.
Most likely it's automatic trading using low-volume trades to gauge current volatility up/down. Fishing, basically.

It's going to depend a lot of your jurisdiction.
But usually. In most places. Yes. You should get taxed on your gains.
What a lot of people don't realize is you can often get a tax credit for losses. If you eat it with certain trades, that's worth remembering.

Have you reported to Reddit security?

2016 * 10mins == 2 weeks. So it's trying to maintain the 10min cadence over ~2 week periods.

What are you worried about? Them losing the money or fumbling a trade?
If you have serious coin you'll hold elsewhere and only send the portion you want to actively trade to the exchange.
