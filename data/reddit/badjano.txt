mark my words, hold the BTCs up until 2021, you won't regret it
also, I seen some comments you confused about where to store it, I would suggest a cold storage ( sending to an address of a private key you keep somewhere safe ) or having a bitcoin node yourself ( that's what I'm doing atm )

ledger could make something to access a bitcoin core rpc api, but you'd have to set that up on the node, which is not by default and not so trivial for standard users.
Also, using a ledger with a node doesn't make sense to me, because if the private keys are in your node wallet, it defeats the purpose of having a ledger. I only use my node wallet, it was the option that made me feel safer, and also, it is kinda the original option for having a wallet, built by the same guys that develop bitcoin itself.

ok, I understand it a little better now, but I don´t want to waste money on a hardware wallet, and I do keep my node wallet encrypted with a strong password in a raspberry pi 4 ( which is my full node ). I do understand a cold storage is safe, but my problem is that I don´t trust anyone, hence the hardware wallet manufacturer.
I´d rather take things into my own hands, and also, using a node I don´t rely on someone to broadcast my transactions and store my private keys.

that the safest way to invest in bitcoin is DCA ( dollar cost average ) which means but little every now and then
the alternative to DCA is buying the dip, which means whenever bitcoin drops you buy, it may save you from the risk of buying before it drops ( statistically speaking )

AFAIK, yes... it is basically 256 slots of data with either 0 or 1, which would give you an integer from 0 to 2 to the power of 256 ( which is a number with 77 digits ) so any number inside that range is perfectly valid with a bit of space in between, like if it was 8bits, 00000000 and 00000001 would be two different private keys with only one bit of difference.

I’m not 100% sure, but this metric might need some recursive calls into a full node, so it’s not just price value on exchanges. Unless you have a full node at home you won’t be getting that data that easy

I think everyone thought of that pattern, the only problem is knowing when to sell. With the luck I got, If I ever short bitcoin it will go up, and if I buy it will dip, so I just hold it and buy more every now and then. It's a simple plan but a safer one.

Schnorr makes possible to generate a combined private key for multi-signature wallets ( I´m not sure about the use of this though, but it seems it was patented and now it´s not so they´re using it )
Taproot improves privacy in the blockchain making transactions more indistinguishable from one another, thus making it harder to track people on the blockchain.

As long as you encrypt it, yes, but if your system is compromised there is a possibility of getting hacked, like if someone gets your wallet.dat before encryption, they might have all your private keys. So you might want to encrypt it ASAP.
If you are very concerned of other people controlling your private keys, than certainly bitcoin core is your best option of a hot wallet, a cold wallet being your best choice.

@_date: 2019-09-19 02:35:24
The thing that makes you own bitcoin is a private key, which is a key used for encryption in order to sign a transaction, that key looks like a random text with lots of random characters. You can store that key whatever way you want, some people generate a QRCode with it, print it and store somewhere safe ( that´s called a cold wallet ). And on the computer you can pretty much do whatever you like, put it on a spreadsheet on google drive, e-mail yourself the key, put it on a file on your computer, etc.
If you have the key, you don´t actually need a wallet, you can just send bitcoin to the respective address of that key and you´ll have control over that bitcoin.
Now when you need to transfer those bitcoins to another address, then you´ll need a bitcoin hot wallet, and most wallets can import private keys in a qrcode pretty easily, and to make sure you chose a safe wallet just google the name of the wallet and get reviews from other users, if you find someone saying they got hacked using that wallet then you just search for another one.
EDIT: There are some ways you can generate a private key for you, there are some websites that do that but be careful, if the owner is dishonest he could store the key he generates and send it to himself. Some people go offline before generating the key just to make sure that this doesn´t happen. I personally use python scripting to generate keys, because I don´t trust anyone to do it for me.
