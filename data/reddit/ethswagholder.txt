If you have a few BTC's to donate, do look at giving back to charities. Many here have become filthy rich this year, but there are millions out there who struggle to get decent food even once a day or medicines or even clothes.

It scares me endless howcryptomarkets are still so volatile and vulnerable to government influence. 
Especially to fake news

 "DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BCH?"

Does anyone know the story behind the last binance hacks? They hushed it up immediately with promises of better security but afaik never released more info about it..

Its not so easy, its just doable, it takes one person with a lot of mining resources (not a lot in terms of Bcash, only in terms of Bitcoin). We dont know if the 6 Exh was added by 1 person, most likely not. 
However, mining capabilities will only grow exponential in the future. 
Dozens of shitcoins were 51% attacked in recent months, and these were actually double spent on exchanges which is a much harder thing to do. Bcash already has margin shorting options on a few exchanges, its only a matter of time I reckon before someone takes this down. 
The hacker obviously needs to think about his security, its one thing double spending verge on a shitcoin exchange, its another thing shorting a top 5 coin while attacking it and leaving no trace in the process.

Not supporting scams, but I Cant care less if bcashers lose their money - they have been warned for little more than a whole year now. Bcash's existence does nothing but add to the drama that is crypto while using Bitcoin's name to further its shady agenda 
Because of their propaganda, people are legit buying Bcash thinking its cheap Bitcoin.

They will sue Roger Vermin for promoting the shitcoin, the same way the dude who said Nano was safe on Shitgrail hack is getting sued.
They will sue Faketoshi and all the devs for working on that network that made them lose money. 
When people lose money, every one associated with that burning pile of shit is a potential target to recover your losses from. No one knows what a jury is going to decide especially considering this is new tech.

That whole sub is a circle jerk of delusional twats blowing other off in the bitmain Sauna room. Do you think they shitcash would have had anyone looking their way if they didn't blatantly steal bitcoin's name and distribute free money ? Yet Wu pig has the audacity to chaim they didn't steal from bitcoin. A liar and a first rate scammer is what he is

You argued like a miserable worm and laid the trap for yourself to be called "a shill, and a scamcoin bagholder". This is the kind of shameless tactic that Bcash bagholders are upto, I see. Similar to spamming the BTC network with 100,000k $4 transactions.

This settlement isnt complete and the news article seems to be just terrible reporting. Read the comments on the article.

 &gt; We are now having to group together and spend money on lawyers to try and get what is rightfully ours. We had 75% of our funds stolen and now the trustee wants to give 70% of what is even left back to Mark Karpeles. I find it disgraceful that this reporter cannot even get these basic facts right and makes it look like we are all greedy people asking for what we don't deserve. We were all victims of the biggest crime in cryptocurrency (still to this day) and now we are having our funds stolen again, this time by the legal system. This time we are having even more taken from us than we did before.
This is just a terrible turn of events and I hope the japanese judges/jury see through this bullshit.

They do not have the BTC ticker. The have stolen the sub's name, and bitcoin's name.

Peer to peer my ass, there are hardly 3 or 4 peers using it.

Lol at hitmen. This isnt some narco trade haha. There are no hitmen in crypto, only winners and losers... and scammers
