Yeah because the price doesn’t Bart like its being manipulated like a puppet on strings lol.
The counter to putting 10k on black isn’t putting 10k on red. It’s walking out of the casino.

Yeah, why would people...laugh at other people. That's never ever been a part of comedy and basic human behavior at all!

All money is a medium of exchange predicated on trust. Any and all value assigned to it is a function of human society, followed by supply and usage.
Government issued fiat currencies have the taxing authority and the civil and military power of the government backing them. They are "manipulated" in a transparent way following regulations and authorities (in most non-Venezuela/Zimbabwe type nations). The Forex market is far larger than the crypto market, along with having significantly more volume (to test assigned prices).
Bitcoin OTOH is completely priced by what the next bagholder will pay. Is propped by tether, wash trading and money laundering. You can't even question that these are occurring, the only question is what percentage of btc's value comes from it.
T;LDR - The way bitcoin functions as money means that the normies will only ever view it as a speculative investment that either they/a friend got burned on/made money off. This is demonstrably not the case with the largest/most significant government issued fiat currencies.

This is a dodge, I assume you mean by total hash power? If so, just say it.
It's on you to establish the criterion for me to answer your question.

Interest rates are likely to be hiked actually.
I'd also like to point out the wealth of other options with far lower volatility/risk.
ETFs, bonds, risk market,properties...the traditional finance sector is actually quite good at providing solid products for the informed investor and regulations mean that disclosures can be relied upon for relatively objective decisions.

Preach, I'm in the same boat.
That said, I do feel bad for people who are heavily leveraged. For some like us, it's some mild amusement or for others it's LARPing as an "expert" but the people buying or selling in a market filled with people like this have crap information.

I believe in value investing, this involves investing in things where the fundamental value (as determined by value of assets/inventory held, cash flow generated or services provided) are undervalued or are increasing in demand and therefore , value.
This is not the case with bitcoin, anything you can do with it, you can do better with other cryptos-let alone fiat which also has actual widespread adoption. Further SEC investigations make this a risky prospect at best. The variance is crazy high and the market is clearly manipulated. (which this very sub accepts with the whales driving it down/pump to the moon posts)
If you like gambling, go and do it. Just don't compare it to investing in actual companies or bonds etc.

Prefer index funds tbh...

I've been saying its a scam since 2015. But then the bitcoiner argument immediately becomes look how much money you could have made...
Can't have it both ways, yall cant criticize people on "missing out", if you are then also going to criticize people for only caring when it pumps and FOMOing in.

.........during the great depression
Say it with me- the GREAT depression
You think deflation was a sign of the economy working right during the depression?! Wut

You and 5 other Indians
The government could make bitcoin  illegal and say it can only be traded for actual shit and there's nothin you could do about it, they literally just said introduced tax on stock tax gains over longer terms and people just took it up the ass. 
Lets be real, btc has a tiny tiny niche in India and thats it.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:11:16
So by your logic, Bill Gates is richer and more successful than McAfee and he thinks btc is crap so...?
Also, by that logic- if I'm richer than anybody, I'm probably smarter than them? Hmmmm

The judiciary doesn't shoot down "arbitrary" laws, they shoot down unconstitutional ones.
 The government essentially with a few national security and human rights exceptions has complete free rein over taxation, currency and monetary policy.
Look, if they can say LTCG is applicable on equities (which is a 100x bigger market) with a snap of their fingers, they can do this.
Perhaps if *you* went back to high school, you'd realize how the Indian constitutional system works. The judiciary cant just be like...hmmmm NAAAAAAAA to regulations.

Sorry m8! I been readin too much nonsense, I misread you bruh
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:51:24
Imagine how many btc you can buy when its worth 10$!!
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:01:31
It IS inconsequential, I have *nooo* idea why it crashed the market, it shouldn't have...besides, I have never highlighted this. I think things like tether and low adoption/usability are why it would/should crash.
I'm just preventing you from spreading info about India that is inaccurate. Why did you feel the need to shill blatantly false information about the Indian governmental system?

It's not like you could even if you wanted to
