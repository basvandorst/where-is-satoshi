GYFT is one SCARY company to deal with! BEWARE! It sounds like they might be running a scam.
It started after I opened an account (they've been around a couple of years, so I thought they were legit.) So I proceeded to try to buy a gift card and my payment didn't go through (credit card), which is odd, so I tried again. That didn't work either, so I proceeded to use my PayPal email as payment. A few moments after that, I received an email saying that my account was suspended. So after reaching for customer service, they asked that they needed my ID as verification. I didn't think of it much since even PayPal does that.
Well, they refused to un-suspend my account. After this ordeal (and unhelpful customer sevice), I wouldn't want to deal with this company, HOWEVER, I am concerned regarding what information is out there that they have to make that decision. They refused to tell me anything, and it is not as if any of my information is new or new accounts (paypal user over 15 years, same bank account &amp; credit card for ages, old phone, no new address). Basically nothing that should have raised a flag, but they still wouldn't tell me why.
My concern now is that they have ALL MY INFORMATION, ALL OF IT! ID, credit card, PayPal email, address, phone!
I don't even know what to do. I'm going to start looking around, after reading some other horror stories about this company. So if I can't find any information, I may have to contact agencies (Federal Trade Commission, Attorney General, etc...)
Darn it! Wish I had read some of these horror stories before I proceeded!
BEWARE! DON'T DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY! STEER AWAY!
