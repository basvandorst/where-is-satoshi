It will be a while, but it will continue snowballing from tiny businesses to small to larger to the largest businesses. If you're new around here, then you might think Bitcoin is tiny, and you would be right. But if you've kept up to date with things for a few years, you would notice that the growth in Bitcoin usage has been huge.
It seems like an obvious buy and hold, but it's easy to chicken out when the value fluctuates so much. That's one big reason why normal people are avoiding it, in addition to the technical understanding required.

My guess is that they will have something like "FaceBux," where users spend $1 to get 1 FaceBuck. They will call FaceBux e-money when in fact they are just dollars with another name. In that case, it will still be all over the news as "new money."
People will then be linking Facebook accounts to bank accounts. They will buy some FaceBux and use them for apps on Facebook and to send them to friends. These transactions won't have to clear through the banking system until the FaceBux are converted back to dollars, which is probably the advantage they are considering. A scheme like that, however, is not new money at all.

Someone should create an ActualMoneyCoin altcoin that is managed by an un-elected team of prestigious economists.
It would be an easy setup. First, elect a bunch of bureaucrats to enforce rules on everyone and pick who runs the ActualMoneyCoin reserve bank. Next, allow ActualMoneyCoin member banks to sell ActualMoneyCoin government bonds to the ActualMoneyCoin reserve bank to help fund the bureaucrats. The ActualMoneyCoin reserve bank can purchase these bonds by creating more ActualMoneyCoins, which member banks can then lend to people to help grow the economy.
Even better would be if the member banks did not even have to have people's deposits available; they could just lend most of it to people and then still claim to have the ActualMoneyCoins on deposit. This is perfectly acceptable because it helps grow the economy by creating more ActualMoneyCoins, unlike the average Joe who would just create more money for greed, so he won't be allowed to.
If the member banks become insolvent, then the ActualMoneyCoin government can bail out the member banks using the funds that they received from the ActualMoneyCoin reserve bank.
A system like this would help promote stability to all users of ActualMoneyCoin, and primitive inventions like Bitcoin would be rendered obsolete because the ActualMoneyCoin government could make competing digital currencies illegal. It's fine that competition would be illegal anyway because the ActualMoneyCoin system would be way more stable. I don't know why anyone would doubt the full faith and credit of the ActualMoneyCoin government, unless they are terrorists.

The industrial uses of gold alone do not justify a $1300/oz price tag. It was also valued as money way before it had any industrial use. Gold is a metal with properties of good money (scarce, fungible, durable, etc.), so that's how it became valuable to begin with.
The reason gold will not fall to 10% of its current price is because it has such a huge history of being valuable. Almost everyone considers gold to be a valuable asset, and they have for many centuries/millenia. As for bitcoins, hardly anyone even knows what they are, let alone sees why they are useful.

To expand, what some money theorists claim is that bitcoins are not money because they have no usage outside of being used as money, therefore they cannot be money because Mises's regression theorem is not satisfied.
What they overlook is that bitcoins *were* valued in their early days just for their unique properties, even though they were barely worth anything. The first bitcoins mined had to subjectively be worth more than the electricity used to mine them, otherwise the miners never would have mined them in the first place. This base case allows Mises's regression theorem to be satisfied, in my opinion.

Most of the time, you can't pinpoint the reason for short-term price movements. All you have to know for Bitcoin is this cycle:
1. Price rises astronomically, media says it's for X reason when it's probably for no reason at all. Everyone says Bitcoin is the resurrection of Jesus. The "to the moon" crowd rules the land.
2. Price goes down steeply, media says it's for Y reason when it's probably for no reason at all. Everyone starts making fun of the "to the moon" crowd. 
3. Prices go nowhere and volume is very low despite various good news and bad news coming out. People lose interest in Bitcoin because it feels like nothing is happening just because the volume is so low.
4. Repeat starting from step 1.

If spending grew economies, governments could aim for 50% annual inflation and have the greatest economies in history.
In reality, inflationary currencies cause people to save too little, going into debt making extravagant purchases, and driving up prices.
Contrast with a high-savings economy, in which present consumption is sacrificed in favor of future consumption, so people live a worse lifestyle in the present in exchange for a better lifestyle in the future. Production is also fueled with more savings and less debt.

Regarding the points on regulation, conflict arbitration is required in every society to prevent fraud. Businesses do it in a government-free society, but unfortunately since government is the monopoly arbitration institution in the real world, we have to rely on its legal protection around Bitcoin-based transactions. Yes, the regulation will go too far every time, but it's all we have.
Also, if governments say nothing, then Bitcoin is technically legal, but guess what. We live in a world where everything has to be explicitly declared legal, otherwise people avoid it. Google's Eric Schmidt, for example, publicly voiced interest in Bitcoin but was concerned about legality.

The issue for some members of the Austrian school is their claim that Bitcoin had no previously-established value before it was used as a currency, violating Mises's regression theorem.
However, if coins had no value, people would not have exchanged electricity for mining them. So they had to have SOME initial value, even if we can't define what that value actually was. The first miners valued the coins more than the electricity used to mine them, otherwise mining would have never occurred.

The supply of Bitcoins now is higher than the supply of Bitcoins one month ago. That is not deflation, that is inflation. Eventually, supply will be constant, so that will be neither inflation nor deflation. Decreasing the supply of coins would be deflation. I am by no means questioning the economic fundamentals of Bitcoin. I happen to think that they are extremely sound, and just want to show that there is no reason to criticize BTC for being deflationary.
Value of coins is driven by basic supply/demand. The reason coins are worth more now than they were a month ago is not because of deflation as you suggest, but because demand has increased more than supply.
If you define deflation as prices of items in BTC falling, which is the conventionally-accepted definition by most economists, then yes, Bitcoin will be deflationary because once supply is constant, prices inevitably decrease as competition enters markets for goods/services. Unfortunately, this conventionally-accepted definition is wrong. I've already linked the dictionary definition of deflation. That is the correct definition. The Bitcoin FAQ should be changed to reflect this.

Yes, it can work. You can't do it with Bitcoins/gold directly, but that's where paper money comes in. Paper money is a promise for a bank to pay you back the amount of BTC/gold indicated on paper. So all the bank has to do is issue more paper notes than actual assets it has on reserve.
However, the reason these paper notes came about in the first place is because they were more convenient to exchange than gold. Bitcoin is already pretty easy to exchange, so this may not be necessary. I think that's a good thing since fractional reserve banking causes a bunch of economic problems.

You say: Why would a rational consumer pay in BTC when BTC might increase in value a week from now and he'll have incurred a loss?
How about: Why would a rational producer sell for USD when USD might decrease in value a week from now and he'll have incurred a loss?
Also, Bitcoin is NOT deflationary. Right now it is inflationary, since supply is increasing. After enough time, it maintains a constant supply. THIS IS NOT DEFLATION. See Webster's definition of deflation, which is "A contraction in the volume of available money or credit that results in a general decline in prices." Source:

I don't understand why he says paper money has face value while bitcoins don't. His argument makes it sound like you can go to a bank and redeem your dollars for gold coins, which you can't do, then says that you can't redeem bitcoins for anything at a bank, therefore bitcoins have no face value. That means for something to have face value, a government must say so, but he seemed to be afraid to make that point directly because it's obviously bunk.

I sold all of mine last night at $115ish just because I've been holding them for such a long time and there is too much pressure seeing the value fluctuate so much. I think Bitcoin will be awesome long-term, but now is not the time for it to take hold. I already tortured myself holding during the long slide in 2011, and I don't want to go through that again, especially since so much more money is on the line now.
I will buy again if I see stability at a lower price. If that doesn't happen, then I'm ok with my current gains.

We all know that Bitcoin is an ingenious concept, but a lot of people are still concerned about whether the price is too high or not for what it is right now.
Let's put it this way for speculators. Would you rather sell when most press is negative and no one is in it (now), or a couple of years down the road when press is positive and everyone is already on board?
I'm talking about selling eventually because to me it seems like a good guess that the Bitcoin economy is undergoing a huge boom due to the Fed artificially pushing down interest rates, allowing malinvestment into the Bitcoin economy. So I think that the price will correct in a big way eventually, but we aren't there yet.
What will happen is that a lot of the same people saying that bitcoins are worthless right now will be buying them in the future, because these people judge their worth by what they see in the news. You will be able to talk to any stranger on the street and they will know about Bitcoin. That will be the time to sell, in my opinion. I could be wrong, but that's what I'm betting on.

Suppose I mine coins and then "donate" them to another address. This other address also happens to be an address that I own. Then I decide to sell my coins.

Interestingly enough, the first time I heard of Bitcoin was from this libertarian blog article: 
Too bad I downloaded the software and then just forgot about it since almost no one was using it. Coulda scored myself some $0.06 coins.
But even when I actually visited the forums in early 2011 it seemed like everyone was a libertarian, and if you weren't then you were the odd one out. So libertarians (myself included) were really the first to have any interest in this thing. And those who aren't interested yet likely just don't understand how bitcoins compare to commodity money like gold. So the issue is not making them aware of Bitcoin, but convincing them of its value.

I'm an idiot too for selling my coins too early. If I still had mine today, they would be worth over $2 million right now.
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:32:29
I'm not technically an early adopter, but here is my story anyway.
I first heard of Bitcoin on July 23, 2010, thought it was a great idea if people actually used it, but didn't pay much attention to it since the coins were worthless and no one used them anyway. I think I mined for a day or so with my CPU using the Satoshi client (the only client available at the time), which used to have a button you could click to mine coins, then figured it's not worth the pennies I would make.
Then sometime in early 2011 for some reason I decided to google "bitcoin" to see if the project had gone anywhere and was shocked to see each coin going for almost $1.
Naturally I got excited and wanted to buy some but it wasn't easy. Keep in mind Dwolla, Coinbase, etc. did not exist. First I tried Liberty Reserve, and I still have no idea what that is even now but it didn't work out at the time. Then I mailed a check to some guy on the forum who offered Mt. Gox dollars to people who sent him checks, but the check was never cashed so I guess he stopped doing it for some reason. The way I eventually got coins was to withdraw $900 from an ATM, then go to Radio Shack to get a prepaid Moneypak card and put the $900 on it since that was the maximum allowable amount (I probably looked really sketchy). Then I gave the code to some other guy on the forum and he gave me Mt. Gox dollars when he had them available. I ended up paying around $3.30 per coin for my first coins since it took so long to figure out how to get them. And it was risky because that was the all-time-high price.
The good news is that I still have those coins plus more.
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:13:37
No, I love Bitcoin but I'm no longer holding any. I had thousands of coins, purchased at an average price of $5 or so, and sold everything at $115 because I didn't want to be a bagholder like I was during the 2011 slide. I needed a few drinks after watching the price crash from $266, and decided that my sanity was more important than holding long-term like I had planned, so I sold a few weeks after the crash.
I'll start thinking about buying again when the price drops under $30, which I think it will. I accumulated the majority of my coins after the 2011 slide, so buying low and selling high has proven effective.
@_date: 2013-02-11 19:15:55
Only if you can afford to lose everything you're putting in. Also keep in mind that even if a crash happens short-term, that doesn't mean the long term success is impacted, as we learned in 2011. So try not to panic sell in that situation, and likewise, don't try to panic buy in a rapid growth situation.
But it's pretty much always a bad idea to buy something just because the price is increasing. It helps to know some basic theory of money, economics, and coding to appreciate the genius of Bitcoin.
Also, pretty much every investment professional in existence will say that Bitcoin is a horrible investment, so keep that in mind too.

Held for years but the huge swings in price became emotionally draining. It was fine when prices were low, but now that prices have risen so much, there is so much more money on the line, so I finally sold everything a couple of days ago (I was not responsible for the huge moves down, my sell was just a blip).
My personal belief is that we have entered a bear market, and I don't want to deal with holding during a long, slow slide like I did a couple of years ago. If I'm wrong, then I'm fine with my current profits and I can just sit on the sideline and hope this thing succeeds. If I'm right, I'll get some more coins when they stabilize lower.
In the long run things should be golden, but it's tough dealing with bumps along the way.

It's better for governments to be explicit about legality than to keep people guessing. You are operating under the assumption that if the rules are not written, the government cannot shut down Bitcoin businesses. This has been explicitly proven false by all of the businesses hesitant to accept bitcoins due to legal implications. Since the rules are now written, the government will have a difficult time shutting down businesses that comply with these rules.
I am in favor of free society and governments not getting involved in these things, but in our present society, everything is assumed illegal unless explicitly declared legal. What we have here, essentially, is a classification of Bitcoin as legal. I am in favor of that declaration, and to me it is well worth the cost of licensing fees that exchanges have to pay.

The only reason anyone would want to reject tainted coins is because of government pressure to do so. Even if accepting tainted coins is not illegal, businesses may only accept clean coins because they don't want to be in future legal trouble. So it's not much of a choice after all.

Supposedly, Michael Brown is "knightmb" on the bitcointalk forums, previously known for possessing 371,000 bitcoins. Yes, 371 thousand, that's not a typo.
He claimed that he donated/gave away most of the coins, which is probably BS. Either way, it wouldn't make sense for him to demand $1,000,000 unless he dumped most of his coins at the previous $2 price bottom and went crazy by seeing how much potential profit that he missed out on.

You'll find that most of us here are partial to the Austrian School, including myself. My response would be that your analysis looks good on the surface, but it's based on a lot of incorrect assumptions. To avoid a huge wall of text, I'll give just a couple of examples:


Have you considered what the cause of these yearly cycles might be? This is very important to evaluating our current system in the context of history. The Austrian School can give a detailed answer, but once again, I'm avoiding wall of text.


This is based on the assumption that inflation leads to continuous economic growth. But you seem to ignore the economic contractions that have occurred even with positive inflation. Your assumption would also lead to the conclusion that economic growth cannot occur if there is no inflation. What if increasing the money supply does not actually increase total wealth in terms of real goods/services, but simply redistributes wealth to those who receive the new money at the expense of those who don't? What if you could explain the economic logic behind why busts always follow booms that are caused by increasing the money supply? The Austrian School can do that.
Conventional economic thought looks at spending as a driver of growth, while completely ignoring the structure of capital. That is literally disregarding half of economics. The Austrian School ties all economic theory together quite nicely, including capital theory. That doesn't mean that everything they say is 100% correct, but it's based on solid foundations.
My goal with this post is to get you to understand how "Bitcoin economists" think without giving you an entire textbook worth of lectures in Austrian economics.

Recognition among institutional investors will be a necessary step for getting Bitcoin on the radar for the average Joe. Even the vast majority of people with technical backgrounds right now have never even heard of Bitcoin. As for some anecdotal evidence of this:
I work in IT for a very large company, and since I had some downtime, I constructed a presentation about Bitcoin and arranged with my manager to give the presentation to the team this coming Friday because we occasionally talk about emerging technologies. When my manager asked the 15 or so developers in the room how many of them have heard of Bitcoin, guess how many raised their hands: 0.
So the point is that even though to us it looks like everyone is talking about Bitcoin (we are on the subreddit after all), almost no one knows it even exists. For speculators, that doesn't mean the price will keep rising without a crash, but in the long term, the price should be a lot higher than it is now.

People didn't historically choose fractional reserve banking. They got fooled into thinking that the banks had their money on demand when in fact they didn't.
Bitcoin makes it easy to trust banks because they can just keep everyone's funds at different addresses to prove that they are not moving them around. If the bank does not give you your own Bitcoin address to act as your "account," then you know that you can't trust them. All you have to do to know that your funds are at your address is to look up the address on the blockchain.

One thing that I learned from 2011 is that a lot of people who say they believe in Bitcoin when the price is rising will think that Bitcoin is doomed once the price starts declining.
I'm glad I wasn't one of those people.
Also, buying the crash is harder than you think, even though you would think it's a piece of cake based on what the price is doing right now. Unfortunately, after hitting $32 in 2011, the price crashed to $20 or so, and I'm sure a lot of people jumped on that buying opportunity. But the price continued to decline for an entire 6 months before bottoming at $2. So during that time, attitudes went from "Don't worry it's just a minor correction" to "Bitcoin will be worth pennies."

Well right now if Mt. Gox or BitPay is shut down the whole thing pretty much collapses. Bitcoin would still be around but mainstream adoption would be nearly impossible in that case.

If they allowed funding Paypal accounts with Bitcoin, as previously suggested by the president of Paypal, then Paypal would act as an escrow service for Bitcoin transactions. Also, that means people could purchase anything with Bitcoin that they could with Paypal (and more, since Paypal limits some transactions but Bitcoin does not).
This means that Bitcoins would be more liquid, so they would become more stable in price and a more trusted asset class to hold (after the price goes up to accommodate the increased usefulness, of course).
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:44:30
$30 per coin was a bad investment for a long time. In the long run perhaps current prices will be cheap, but I don't want to see my money evaporate in the shorter term.

Minimizing the predictions I have to make. The only prediction I'm making is that the price of bitcoins rises in the long term. Doesn't matter how much, just that it rises any amount at all.
So if I sell at any given time, there is a chance the price goes higher and I will never see prices that low again, therefore losing money. But if the price goes lower and I buy more, based on my one prediction, I can guarantee that at some point, the price will be above where I bought at.
So during this upward surge I'm just holding. Then during a downtrend, the more it goes down, the more I will buy. That's what I did during the 2011 episode and it worked out very well.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:33:53
Yeah, it's probably just best to hold through everything if you can afford it. Otherwise you might end up like me, thinking every day about how if I still had my coins today, I could retire. And I'm in my early 20s.
But it gets pretty tough holding when your coins start to be worth hundreds of thousands. That's when price fluctuations are tough to deal with, not to mention the fear of your coins somehow getting lost or stolen. I used to have nightmares about these things.

The best move would have been getting your money out IMMEDIATELY after the news about Gox's Dwolla account being seized. Especially after all of the horror stories in the last couple of years about how some shady service stole people's money.

It's not a DDOS, just too many people trying to place orders. Mostly sell orders, of course.
This could be a momentary correction or the beginning of a long slide, it's impossible to tell. But with all the potential money that is currently looking at Bitcoin, to me it seems unlikely that the new long-term trend is down. Even if it is, anyone can keep cash savings to eventually buy more coins, like smart people did after the 2011 crash when the price stabilized at $5.
What a long slide will do, like in 2011, is weed out all of the people who bought in for a quick buck, and favor people who still see Bitcoin's long-term growth potential.

Pretty sure the 2011 price spike was due to publicity about Silk Road. Since fewer coins existed and market depth was lower, prices were more easily driven up than they are now. Then Mt. Gox was hacked and the price crashed by almost half due to loss of confidence, even though no funds were lost. Shortly afterwards, MyBitcoin was "hacked" (many believe that the creator ran with the money) and the price kept declining for another half a year or so. Then nothing interesting happened in 2012, and here we are today.
Also during the 2011 spike, lots of newcomers appeared on the subreddit and bitcointalk forums. A lot of them probably disappeared after the crash.

Actually, this is what would happen for any real commodity. If the price of gold rises, more gold mining will occur and **gold supply will increase at a higher rate**. If the price of bitcoins rises, more bitcoin mining will occur but the **bitcoin supply will always increase at the same rate**. This is a problem that I've seen with Bitcoin that no one has given me a sufficient answer for.


The Fed is different because they do not take into account supply/demand for money because the cost to print is virtually 0. Instead they just increase the money supply too much all the time.

Bitcoin is great, but it still has one weakness. Governments can find any excuse to make purchasing Bitcoins with dollars illegal. They can just say "hey, people are using these to buy drugs" and just shut down the exchanges without due process, similar to what happened with online poker.
Or they can say "Bitcoin is a threat to national security because terrorists can use it." Or they can say "Bitcoin is compromising the value of our currency and is endangering the stability of the economy."
Shutting down exchanges won't get rid of Bitcoin, but it would put a huge dent in the market and it would never go mainstream. Consequently, the value would collapse overnight.
On a positive note, the Bitcoin Foundation exists to combat bad PR.

Exactly, and that's why everyone needs to stop mindlessly bashing it when they barely even know what it is.
The idea of it is to be able to transfer any kind of money instantly within a peer-to-peer network. A ledger keeps track of balances, but the only time the actual money has to be transferred between people is when users "cash out" via gateways. But users can also just keep the claims to those funds on the network.
It's a cool idea, but we don't know enough about the implementation yet to point out any serious flaws with reasonable certainty. The skepticism is about XRP, the Ripple currency that is used to prevent transaction spam.
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:48:45
Let's look at what Krugman says line by line.


What this assumes is that not spending X dollars in the present means that these X dollars are never spent. The truth is that these dollars will be spent at some point in the future. In fact, more present saving means more future economic growth, since capital is created from savings. If this is not the case, humanity would have never evolved beyond a primitive hunter-gatherer society.


This is confusing to readers unless you understand Krugman's assumptions. The first assumption is that more businesses will borrow money when interest rates are low. This is correct, but the conclusion Krugman comes to is that lower interest rates leads to a healthier economy due to more businesses sprouting up, therefore more employment is created. This seems reasonable if you only think in monetary terms instead of real terms. But Krugman seems to think that any employment is productive employment. Study Austrian Business Cycle Theory to see how this employment due to artifically low interest rates is unproductive.


Correct, even if not for the reasons that Krugman thinks it is.


The classic "Paradox of Thrift" central to Keynesian policy advocates. First what I want to point out is not once in the entire history of the world has a deflationary spiral actually occurred. This fact alone draws suspicions to this theory.
The theory assumes that people will continue to hoard cash balances and never spend them. Prices will fall, but because wages also fall, the effect of falling prices is negated.
Here is the major flaw in that argument. The theory assumes that if everyone saves, individuals will not increase their wealth because both prices and wages will fall. But what about the total amount of savings that individuals have accumulated? Even if my wages fall, my total savings accumulated stay the same, so I am wealthier than I would be if prices did not fall. Because prices have fallen, I am now more inclined to spend my accumulated savings.


Once again, Krugman attributes economic growth to borrowing and spending as much as possible immediately. The reality is that the higher burden for debtors is because there is a low amount of savings to lend out, so savings need to be restored before more borrowing and spending can occur. Basic supply and demand.


I don't have time to read the source unfortunately, but I doubt there is detailed reasoning about why debtors cut spending and creditors don't increase spending. It is likely just an observation made at some arbitrary point in time, when in fact there are likely many factors dictating how much creditors spend.


Makes sense if an economy is correcting itself from a boom because of all of the credit contraction. But that doesn't mean the same will apply to a system like Bitcoin, where the supply of money stays constant (after all coins are mined). What will happen is that as the capital structure expands over time, goods and services will become cheaper relative to labor, so labor will be worth progressively more. The nominal price of labor should not matter.
I'll ignore the last paragraph since it's just some conclusions based on Krugman's faulty analysis.
@_date: 2013-03-02 20:27:19
Something else that bothers me is the way change works. I sent someone a small number of bitcoins, and then almost the entirety of the rest of my balance was sent to a different address. I guess that was the change. It's fine because it's part of my wallet, but the only reason I knew it happened is because I looked up my main address on blockchain. When I saw almost no coins left on my main address I almost had a heart attack. Once I realized what happened, I had to resend all of my coins from the new address back to my original address.
So if one day I didn't realize this happened, and all I had was my private key for my main address, I would be screwed over.

If more miners start mining, the difficulty increases so that each miner receives less, meaning the supply of new coins stays the same.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:38:22
The problem I have with these kinds of analyses is that people just assume that money is created by a government saying "this is money, use it." But money emerging on the market takes time to spread and will not be stable in its emergence. Rather, an increasing value encourages wider adoption of the currency, which then allows for stability once more people use it.
This is why people are not only buying bitcoins more than ever, but also spending them more than ever. However, this does not discount the possibility of overspeculation, it just illustrates what the long term trend should be if some external factor does not interfere with Bitcoin's growth.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:24:01
You are entitled to your opinion. But notice how the price tanked even with Paypal talking about incorporating Bitcoin into their platform, which should be hugely positive news. That, to me, is a bad sign.
I've seen the whole "this isn't like most investment opportunities" argument before, when the price was going from $30 to $2. I think predictions of future Bitcoin adoption have already been incorporated into the price. Otherwise it wouldn't be so high, because the current Bitcoin economy does not justify the price right now at all.

Of course, the current price is partially attributed to what people estimate its future adoption will be. But consider that the big money players in finance had no idea what Bitcoin even was until all of the recent media coverage. So it's possible that we still have a ways to go with price increases.
I would not be surprised if given the Fed's generous credit expansion, a gigantic bubble forms in Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses. In that case, the same people who are crying "bubble" right now will end up jumping in within the next couple of years, only to get screwed over when a big crash happens.

This doesn't make sense because the author did not demonstrate any examples of this correlation. In order for this to actually work, he would have to show concrete examples of these metrics decreasing before price corrections occur.

Not necessarily a crash back to $5, but the crash could be from, say, $50 to $15, or an infinite number of other possibilities. But one thing I personally am absolutely certain of is that the current rally WILL end in a significant crash.
Why is this? Well, Bitcoin sure is way better than paper currencies, but contrary to popular belief, it is not equivalent to a 100% free market commodity. A real free market commodity would compensate for increased demand with increased production. With Bitcoin, the rate of production is constant. So instead of encouraging spending when people are saving, Bitcoin encourages saving more when people are already saving and saving less when people are already not saving. Therefore, any minor uptrends/downtrends are extended into major booms and busts.
Regarding rallies: since demand is finite, when demand dries up, the new supply of coins created will outweigh new demand. This is when people will begin to sell coins since production relative to demand is now high, and now people are discouraged from saving so much, causing the crash.
The boom/bust nature of Bitcoin will cause it to grow more slowly in the long term than it otherwise would with smaller cycles. But it will still grow.

Emptying your savings to buy anything is always a bad idea. Hindsight is 20/20, but you made the right decision at the time.

How are we supposed to know our losses if we can't even tell what the price is right now?

Because at the time, Mt. Gox was the only established exchange and it was under fire from the US government (Dwolla account seized). In the short term, it was the correct decision considering how much trouble Gox had processing USD withdrawals after I cashed out everything. 
Maybe I would have taken the risk and held on if I knew Chinese demand would explode like this, but who could have predicted that? It's the only reason the price is rising so much right now.
It's easy for you to say "hold at all costs," but your thought process would change if you had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of an extremely volatile and experimental virtual money representing the vast majority of your net worth. At least I can sleep at night now and not have emotional rollercoasters.

I would say "Bitcoin user not affected" but unfortunately we have Mt. Gox.

I like how the guy who scoffs at Bitcoin being virtual nothingness fails to realize that 97-98% of US dollars are also virtual. He also says that "the point of a currency is to raise money through taxation." Comedy gold.
Seems like none of these "analysts" have any idea why people would want to own bitcoins. Instead they just act all surprised like it doesn't make sense.

So it would seem from this article that there's nothing stopping a bunch of people from writing scripts to execute this same attack repeatedly and bankrupting SatoshiDice.

Announcement: You are going to threaten to place a sell order of 25,000 bitcoins to try and induce a crash by other people selling, in which case you will buy at a lower price.

Actually it's inflationary until it approaches the 21M coin limit, in which case the supply is stable.

I'm wondering this too because I used to use Mt. Gox, but I will not use it in its current state. Is Bitstamp OK? How much verification do they need for large amounts of money?
I'm not buying coins anytime soon, but I would prefer to be ready now so that I don't have to deal with complicated setup in the future.

While this is always a risk, what justification would there be? As long as all bitcoin trading is compliant with regulations just like all other financial instruments, finding a justification for seizure of assets in this manner would be very difficult.

Care to explain?

They can consume even less power by not releasing a product. Seems to be working so far.
