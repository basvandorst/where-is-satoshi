You are missing one key investment principle - Diversification.  You should hold other coins as well until the dust settles.

Ok so at this point you have lost about $400.  Here is what you do.  Wait for another month when it drops to $2000 per coin and buy more so you dollar cost average and your cost per coin will come down.  wait for another 2 years for it to go back up then sell one coin to get your investment back.

It is like gold as that it holds value.  The important piece you are missing is that there are now easy to use exchanges for bitcoin and they are easily converted to USD or Euros or Whatever.

Congratulations! *clap! clap!* I have only a tenth of a bitcoin.  Fuck me right :(
