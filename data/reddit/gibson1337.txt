Most of the altcoins can be traded only for btc/eth. When the prices of btc/eth fall, the altcoin price follows.

It has only been around 2 months since I have seen people writing that they bought at $5.4k ATH and were thinking about selling at a loss. This is only one of the first stages of hyperbitcoinization. Be happy that you got on the coaster as fast as you did. Now just resist the selling temptation and HODL.

* Correct.
* Your Ledger provides a fresh address after every transaction. All of these addresses are, however, always tied with your wallet. If someone, for example, sends you btc to your old address, you still receive them.
* You could set up a throwaway desktop/android/ios wallet and try it out with a small amount of btc. By doing so, you are still paying the transaction fees, though.
* Correct.
* If you lose/break etc. your ledger, you can recover your wallet with your mnemonic code (24 words).
I hope this helps :)

A colleague of mine roasted me about 2 weeks ago over buying bitcoin back in 2017: "So, how's that Bitcoin thing going on for you? Do you still believe in this bubble?". 
After seeing that the surrounding group of people shared his opinion, and knowing about the recent price surge, I suddenly realized that we are still at the beginning of the bull market. The disbelief is still strong among the common folk. 
Of course I just awkwardly laughed it off saying that human stupidity has no boundaries. It was percieved as if I was making a joke at my expense. Little did they know...

As a student, I just wish I had 3400usd at my disposal to invest in BTC. Buckle up and enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:17:32
Could you please elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:23:53
Definitely. I would jump in too ifI haddome cash avaliable. ATMs in my country have too high of a fee...
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:27:23
For around 2 hours and 8 minutes. Give or take a couple minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:57:05
And I thought that buying in at 8200 was purely FOMO...
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:24:28
And [this]( is why I believe the sudden sell orders afterward are from the same whale. There is a sudden dip after every "5 pump".
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:38:57
My thoughts exactly. The only other way to obtain that amount of bitcoin would be by buying the sellwals. This would however not be as profitable since the price could rise at a faster rate. The **usual** dips before/after the pattern could further explain your argument.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:25:29
It is worth mentioning that 5btc/30s means 600btc an hour which is obviously an insane amount of (probably) institutional money.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:38:51
I might be a bit over intrigued but do you seriously think that someone buying bitcoin at a **constant rate** of 5btc/30s for **three days in a row** now does not seem like a bot of some investor? 
Prediction: this pump shall continue for around two hours followed by a sudden dip at around 10 PM CET give or take. [The same thing happened yesterday.](
Just take a look at GDAX and you will see how bullish we can be with that amount of money flowing in on a daily basis.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:04:06
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:57:52
I also cannot seem to resist perfectly timing the 5btc orders. Damn...
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:59:47
The bitcoin ATMs in my country have 6.5% fees.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:56:07
This [daily investing pattern]( (constant 5btc/30s orders in two hours span) definitely supports your statement.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:34:14
Or could it be just an optical illusion you are seeing ;)
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:40:55
Let me walk you through it... At the current price of 7335.64$ per BTC, 100$ would get you 0.01359800BTC. To calculate what that amount would be worth at said price you simply multiply the numbers.
0.01359800BTC * 2000000$/BTC = 27196$

Have you ever thought of looking up the underlying technology that bitcoin is based on? 
I have heard the same kind of argument numerous of times and when I tried to explain how a blockchain leger functions suddenly everyone stops being interested. 
My point is that people not yet in bitcoin do not understand the potential this kind of mathematical construct could have on our daily lives. Hey, even I thought that touchscreen phones were a farce. Could you guess what am I typing this comment on?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:17:36
I am leaning to the second option simply because selling the coins in a rapid succession could cause quite a dip.

Comments like this should get around more often.

Nice catch! I have edited the post accordingly :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:03:43
One might say that. 
I noticed this yesterday and have been eager to see if it reappears today. I was not disappointed. Plus it was a good excuse for a (too) long study break, especially if it helps anyone :)

You do realize that on the picture, the random redditor bought at a lower price, right?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:12:02
You are correct. The intervals between orders is 30 seconds on average. One can easily spot it though - all you need is the patience to wait around 30 seconds and the next order appears. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:32:59
And I thought I was being reckless buying my first bitcoin during the china ban dip back in the middle of september. Congrats everyone!
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:04:41
Does it really? I was always under the impression that the price usually goes up on Monday/Tuesday since the bank transactions start to roll out. There is every likelihood that I am wrong though...
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:18:22
Probably some institutional money flowing in for the next 2 hours. The same pattern appeared at around the same time for the last couple of days. 5btc/30s = 600btc an hour. Bullish.

I mean, it certainly can be expensive to use, especially when one slowly tries to unreliably spam the network w/ overpaid transactions
