How about installing an ordinary vending machine and stocking it with paper cards, each of which reveal a unique private key of a pre-generated wallet containing the corresponding amount?

So the judiciary, law enforcement, public education, defense, social security, management of transportation/energy/water/communications/waste infrastructure, and emergency services are made obsolete by bitcoin how exactly?

And when you have hundreds of thousands of dollars of disposable play money; how hard do you think it is to be in Japan, or have someone else be in Japan and create an account for you?
Some people are just comically naive...

Perhaps downvotes on comments like these are an indication that bitcoin is entering its AOL phase. Don't expect summer to end anytime soon...

I'd rather say the reason many startups go belly up is because they don't set the right priorities at the right time.
If you have a product that is already usable such that it immediately fulfills a need in the market, then sure, as you say, *you need to communicate it in a way they understand and design it in a way that's easy to use*.
But if your product is not yet capable of doing that, then no matter how much resources you spend on communicating it, you'll just end up putting the cart before the horse.
What use is bitcoin right now to the average consumer when very few major retailers accept it as a means of payment, handling and storing the currency safely is tricky at best, and getting your coins involves dealing with intermediaries that operate with hardly any oversight or accountability?

And there is another very bad scenario for those with a stake in bitcoin, but most of seems to prefer believing it doesn't exist: a new cryptocurrency appearing out of nowhere with such a fundamental innovation over the current state of the art, that it offers immediate benefits over bitcoin, resulting in a gold rush toward it so strong that the bitcoin devs are left with insufficient time to adopt the new technology given the backward compatibility constraints and general inertia of having a huge installed base to consider.

And what exactly is that supposed to mean?
What exactly need someone do to be put on this somewhat lucrative looking list of "core devs"? How do you measure contributions to bitcoin?
And why do you think these people have some magically superb code that they're secretly keeping offline until some random fool is willing to pay a hundred thousand dollars to have it all dumped on github -- as if that is sure to solve some vague problem that doesn't even make much sense let alone sure to exist?
Sorry about the pesky questions. I'll join the chorus now, I guess. Hurray! Hurray!

Oh, you're so *anthropocentric*.
When the machines rise, they too will need a form of currency. But will they find "food, water &amp; shelter" particularly valuable? 
Not more so than any other mineral and energy source out there!

Even if you bet on their superior intellect forming a harmonious collective without need or notion of personal property, I think currency will still exist because of its effectiveness as a means of keeping track of resources among the nodes of the skynet, so to speak.

Things did suddenly change. Dwolla stopped processing for MtGox last month, which caused a huge spike of ex-Dwolla customers switching over to wire transfers (because they no longer have a choice).
Besides, MtGox have meanwhile confirmed what I said word for word in their [update]( on this subreddit:

I've thought about this idea ever since Bitcoin first became popular.
The biggest problem is ensuring anonymous voting. I don't think anyone has come up with a way to ensure the transparency needed to prevent double voting, while at the same time allowing voters to keep their identity a secret and who or what they voted on private.

Note though --before anyone pulls this statement out of context-- that it depends on what definition of the word *hacking* is employed. Specifically, some people consider reverse engineering to be a form of hacking; and reverse engineering for the sake of *interoperability* (i.e., the ability to exchange and make use of information) is legal as per section 103(f) of the DMCA, as long as the reverse-engineered software/object was obtained legally.

You clearly have never dealt with Japanese banks before (MtGox uses Mizuho). All the Japanese banks I've dealt with seemed to have a very old-fashioned way of working.
Moreover, I have the impression that international wire transactions are scrutinized more in Japan than in most other countries.
For example, when I still regularly used my account at Mitsui-Sumitomo, I'd get a phone call to confirm validity every time a foreign wire transfer came in, plus separate snail mail for every single transaction.
All in all, MtGox's story doesn't strike me as unlikely. If anything MtGox are morons for not having multiple backup accounts ready at multiple banks for situations like this.

Then you're still wasting money for no good reason. It's *much* cheaper to just rent some time on a server farm or even a supercomputer somewhere.
Unless you're planning to make a hobby out of forgetting your passwords... :V

No, you basically said "Unfortunately, the account confirmed it" (because が indicates that the preceding word アカウント is the subject doing the confirming).
When it's not relevant which specific individual did the actual confirming, using the passive 確認されました is the only natural choice.
However, if for whatever reason you deem it necessary to use 確認しました, the account becomes the object, which means you need to use アカウントを確認しました (e.g. 残念ながら私がアカウントを確認しました。"Unfortunately, it was *ME* who confirmed the account").
You may be confused by verbs like できる, where the "object" is indicated by が (e.g. "アップルパイができた"), but 確認する is not one of them.
*EDIT:*  Actually another correct way to phrase your sentence would be "残念ながらアカウントが確認できました。" Maybe that's what you were going for. But again, できる is irregular like that, while する isn't.
