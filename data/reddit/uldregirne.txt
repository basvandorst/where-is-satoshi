I store the private keys unencrypted in a Reddit post only I can see. Come at me hackers!

It can make sense to sell some of your Bitcoin at certain marks to lock in profits. The key point is that it is only some of your Bitcoin. you have to balance the ability to acquire and purchase things in the current moment with potential growth and upside in the future. We all have to take into account the fact that we might be dead in three years, so we should be able to use some of our profits to make our day to day life happier. But that doesn't mean we sell everything we have and get a lambo. Personally, I might sell about 10% if we got to 50/100K.

Be careful. If you believe Bitcoin with be worth a lot more someday, your account is now a target. We like to believe in the safety of our keys, but it's nothing if in the future someone tries a wrench attack.

Your wording makes more sense. "Police morality" is the act of enforcing moral standards. "Morality police" are the enforcers who focus on morality. I am the morality police, and I police morality.

You gotta reward the people who do a good job, otherwise you wind up with only shitty porn.
After this comment I now realize I should probably go pay some pornstars...I can't afford to be a hypocrite.

May not be able to do anything now, but a not could easily watch their posts for an indication of where they live. You could contact them talking about something they are interested in, and once u get an email etc cross-reference it with personal data you've bought online. It may not be particularly worth it now, but as btc goes up the incentive just increases. Although to be fair, most people who post/comment here are targets regardless.

Cool, what you doing next week? I'll stop by for coffee?

How often do golden crosses lead to rallies in other markets other than Bitcoin?

This. The public leger has already been used to track illicit Bitcoin gains, and the government can pinpoint people once they send Bitcoin to an exchange with KYC. They have nabbed a bunch of silk road dealers that way.

$10,000 = 1 BTC . More added stuff, but it would make more sense. Still good memes as is.

The USA has effectively stated it will sanction any individual it knows are associated with those addresses. They cannot stop the Bitcoin from being sent, but they can try to take action against the people that control the addresses. So the government has actually done nothing to impact the block chain, and are just using the public Leger. If I made a website that sold child pornography, and had people pay for it in btc, if the government found my address in theory they could then use those transactions as a reason to investigate those who sent me money, because they could then assume that those people are in the possession of child pornography. So basically the government has said "we know the money in these wallets was stolen, don't accept it or we will be mad". 
That being said, this all relies on the enforcement of the sanctions. If you are in Iran, what the USA tells you to do is moot considering they aren't really involved in our economy anyways due to previous sanctions.
Plus the hackers could just tumble/mix their coins with a multitude of services to evade detection. Main thing is the USA doesn't want major exchanges to accept those bitcoins, but they still could anyway.

They tried to do that with the petrocoin or something like that. Crypto backed by oil reserves. The reason the government insists people use their money is because they are the ones printing a fuck ton of new money. They are the ones creating inflation to pay for stuff, including the costs to get to oil out of the ground that they give away for "free". But that money has to come from oil revenue or taxes, or inflation....

"The global average efficiencies of electricity production are 34% for coal, 40% for natural gas and 37% for oil. For all fossil fuels, the global average efficiency is 36%."
Electricity generation is 40% from Oil 52% from Natural Gas and 8% from steam.
Notice I didn't say it didn't work, but that it wasn't the best. Even the Saudis try to use Natural gas as much as they can instead of Oil. But some of their natural gas fields have lots of sulfur, which makes it less feasible.

I go to my local bank about once a week to deposit cash, and it's a pretty decent experience. The trick is to come on a specific day of the week and be nice/social with the tellers. Eventually when you go to the bank it's to drop off money, but more importantly to see/chat with some friends. Note, this same technique also works at restaurants.

Petroleum isn't actually great for producing electricity. We use it in our cars because it's so damn convenient. Most oil producing Nations prefer to sell their oil and produce electricity through more cost effective methods.
