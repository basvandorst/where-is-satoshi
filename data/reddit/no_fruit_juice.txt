How much should I be looking to spend?
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:43:05
That is for me, I am personally 18 and only looking to invest 500 dollars into STOCKS. I am looking into Bitcoin for my father who has a lot more money and free time than I do. 
I am not sure why this would seem like trolling as these are all serious questions?

Yes thank you! I have read that CPU AND GPU mining is silly now and that getting optimized mining chips is the way to go and it seems my best bet is to wait until Feb 2014 for the new ones

Should I be looking to invest 100-200k?
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:22:35
I have been telling him what you guys have told me . He is learning more about the mining and it doesn't appeal as much now and direct investing might bf the answer k

Thank you! I am looking into Butterfly labs now!

Do you know where I can purchase in bulk? I am willing to invest 10-15k if anyone wants to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:45:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:28:58
Thank you! So working with about 125k can you help me go through and build a rig? I am very interested and am willing to invest the money needed.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:04:28

@_date: 2013-12-19 03:41:59
When I say 100-200k I am asking for my father. I am 18, but am looking into it for my dad who has a lot more money and an interest in getting involved with bitcoin
