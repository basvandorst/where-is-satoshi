The problem is that Amir gave countless presentations.

The article is ancient. You were comparing 2010 SSD.. Um... I have 2012..

So I assume it would take ./Bitcoin-Qt -checkblocks=0 about 30hours?
@_date: 2012-11-18 16:56:41
The original download was about 24 hours though, so it isn't just bound by HDD. It's bound by a combination of network, hdd and IO.

What 5 coins?

Possible, I am not calling for anything. Just that he did a bunch of these presentation, its possible he's getting harassed about bitcoinica.

Took like 5 minutes on a macbook air.
@_date: 2012-11-17 18:43:20
No, it was done awhile ago. So about an hour, may be two at most? debug.log has no timestamps :-(
edit: disk did peak at about 70mb/sec. my macbook air has an apple ssd, which is fast.
edit2: uh ran out of space, last block was at 97%....umm need to rerun.
@_date: 2012-11-17 15:52:39
let me do that :-)

Yea, waste $300 on an electrical bill to get a single bitcoin.. They can just buy them...
@_date: 2013-02-07 23:36:02
Next halving is in few years :-) They got time.

Oh great let's replace PHP with RoR, PHP actually pwns Ruby performance wise.
And Rails just had a shit load of securities holes..

Now get AVR Dragon and push to it 8Ghz! My Jalapeno runs at 8.2 with 4% of hardware errors.

Spammer. It's irrelevant if I mined or not. It doesn't matter how you get the bitcoins. You're just here to promote your pool.

There are many contingencies, like compliance with all local laws. That implies USA / Canada / Japan. 
This case won't be simple and if it goes to trial it will be years. Can CoinLab afford it? Probably not.

I don't mine. Stopped a long time ago, when buying bitcoins started to be cheaper than mining. Yes, I buy bitcoins now.
This is the second your post to with your pool link. Yes, you're a spammer.
You have an assumption that everyone has an ATI card, so mining on my HD4000 laptop is really bad idea. You can destroy my laptop this way (shorten its life by a huge margin). I don't have any ATI cards or desktops.

Xdes here:
What's the difference 10 times? Please RoR vulnerabilities affected every damn RoR installation. Also you linked RAILS not ROR vulnerabilities (edit: didn't pay attention, I relinked the same thing. But RoR has more vulnerabilities this year than PHP): 
Lets see again:
PHP: 2013 : 11 
RoR: 2013: 12
