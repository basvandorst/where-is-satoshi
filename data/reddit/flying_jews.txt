We use UPS exclusively for our shipping- and my rep loves us for our volume, so this would be awesome! 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:15:27
Yes,. We should. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 02:35:28
That would us- Minersource.net, sharing the table with Cryptomint and Balanced Energy. Feel free to stop by tomorrow, we should have more! Thanks to bitmain for giving us them to give away!

If theres money- theres a way. With this much potential to be made you can be sure we will have true mass production inside of 4 months.

I like the idea of limited in the short term - should dispear after you have completed say 2-3 transactions and you havent charged back in the 30 days you had to do so. Does that even make sense? 
If you want any help/ someone to bounce ideas off I would be happy to help as a buisness/econ major
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:12:50
All of the above.

Not sure why there are down votes here. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:04:30
If this is true, You have a cutsomer here.
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:19:54
Glad someone actually knows what they are talking about.
@_date: 2013-10-26 14:11:47
What happened to the giant bitcointalk thread?
@_date: 2013-06-19 19:22:00
Why would it? Any buisness would do it if they knew they could get away with it.. the purpose of a buisness is to provide a service and create profit, so if under reporting cash sales and getting away with it is an option, you can be sure it is atleast considered.

When your supposed to be studying Financial accounting and only thinking about BTC you know you have a problem. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 20:52:18
People I think Are valueing the stock in USD then converting in their heads to BTC, not thinking in terms of pure btc.
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:57:37
no its every 2 weeks. 30% faster than 14 days, witch is just under 10. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:37:14
Joining the bandwagon here. Was told friday, still nothing. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:28:57
You do know in the investing world a "risky" investment that pays 19-20% is considered amazing. but 33%? Sold!

Id buy into this Blanket-distributing cartel.

Donated my fair share. Do nothing else but to prove the system works.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:07:08
Doesn't address the problem outlined in the article- they need the bank account to pay TAXES. Last time I checked the US gov. did not accept BTC. And a service like bitpay wouldnt work... again because no bank accounts. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:30:56
That applies to a very large number of investments.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:57:46
My BTC business didnt start in a garage... but it did in kitchen! 
Roomates dont like miners.

Inventory tracking, looking at bank accounts, recent purchases etc. Exactly how people are caught for it each and every day. Just not even close to the number of people who do it. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:47:33
This is awesome!
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:20:46
$5 + 5% works for me. Or a min purchase amount to mitigate fees. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:15:38
Gona take a look! 
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:02:05
Yes please- I would love to spread this to local managers. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 11:13:23
Also some sort of whitelist type database would further reduce your risk.
