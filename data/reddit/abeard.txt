I did faucets for maybe 2 hours randomly throughout the day for a month in 2012 or 13. I recently logged back into that acct for the first time in years and it was almost $200

My friend runs Philadelphia Community Corps a nonprofit that helps salvage things from ruined and blighted buildings in the city and restores them to be habitable again.  they also do job training with many city programs.

Thank you for taking the time to respond and helpfully. I'm just mentally fried right now from having back to back monster nursing exams and now concept maps due. 
I'll definitely look into switching it over now but I may have to wait till Thursday as I have clinicals tomorrow early and my paying job all later that night. 
The email just kinda made the little bit of understanding I had just go right out the window. I had always thought coinbase was the legit one with nothing to worry about like mt gox. 
Just want to thank you again for the reply and having it be succinct and firm enough to finally get me to do it. 
I may just cash out now instead of cold storage I have tuition bills and I bought most of mine at $76 and had just let them sit on the exchange since I didn't plan on cashing out for a while. 
Sorry for the ramble I'm mentally drained right now and lacking a lot of sleep.

And then hopefully drop some more cuz I’ll keep buying if I got some extra chedda laying around.

I bet you a lot of the people in this age group who aren't on facebook trust financial institutions even less than the ones who took the poll.

Not sure if I'll be excited or pissed to see the 0.01 BTC show up.

I sold mine at 1300 right before it took off to the moon. However I wasn't kicked out of nursing school due to being on financial hold.  Owed a lot to school, sold the handful I had right before my last semester and residency. 2 months till graduation now and can't be happier w my forced sell. I still owe a shit ton. But I won't graduate a year late now. And I bought $60 worth today. $50 and set up $10 recurring weekly.
I'M BACK IN THE GAME BABY

Yup, but that's why I was looking at unfunded ones already made.  That's also how I just heard about them.

I could have told you when mining by hand was over, the second that math became involved.

That is pretty cool.  Is that site legit? It seems like nothing but the 4 cards are on the site.  All of the other links aren't updated to anything.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:01:20
Paper wallet it is then.  I was just thinking of getting one with nothing loaded at all on it like [this coin]( and fund it myself?

We're 'Murican here, don't think you gotta worry about proper etiquette and what the experts say for this side of the pond.
I have also always given cash as a wedding gift because I probably would buy the same set of plateware or forks etc as 10 other people.  Take my cash and buy what you really want.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:14:20
Oh I would personally hate the drama myself as well and I wouldn't have the gall to ask people for anything besides normal wedding fare.  But I'm at the age where most of my friends are getting married now and I see all this nonsense going on about gifts and wedding parties etc.  Drama free and an open bar is my favorite type of wedding.

as a broke ski instructor why not give this a shot.
