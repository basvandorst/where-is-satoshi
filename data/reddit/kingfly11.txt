Sorry for the ambiguity here. I am not talking about individual Bitcoins but rather the overall market cap. It is indeed easier to support as the market cap gets lower. An extreme example of the phenomenon I’m trying to highlight is as follows. Let’s say the market cap for all Bitcoins is $100. If all the Bitcoins flooded the market at the same time, it would only take $100 to maintain the price point. 
Does that clear things up?

Thanks for the tip! My very first crypto!

I agree with you on the increasing ease of use in transactions. However, as I wrote in my original post, why would you use Bitcoin for your day-to-day transactions if the underlying asset can rise and fall by multitudes more than a typical, mainstream currency like the USD or the Euro?

I agree that that the underlying tech is replicable, and as such, is not the moat. That was one of the main reasons I didn’t jump in years ago. I believe the moat that’s developed is it being the first mover for the years since it’s inception, and, importantly, in the great crypto coming-out party that occurred last year. 
I do stand by my claim that it is analogous to gold, since gold’s value is not predicated on its actual use in the economy. Similarly, Bitcoin‘s value is not based on its use in the economy. It’s value, if it succeeds, is as a diversifying asset whose value is detached from other activities in the economy (i.e. providing beta diversity) similar to how gold is treated as an asset. 
Anyway, back to the moat. I am betting on human psychology. It was Bitcoin that led in the headlines and drove the overall boom. It wasn’t because of some unique features in its coding compared to other cryptocurrencies. It was the leader because it was the leader. I know, that seems like weak logic, but then I flip the question back to you: why will another alt-coin rise to overtake Bitcoin? Is this Bitcoin beater more efficient at transactions? I don’t think that matters since I am talking about it being a store of value rather than it being an actual currency. 
I am interested to hear your response.

Hi, thanks for the suggestions. I think I’m gonna go with Ledger after doing some research.

While my brief checklist (i.e. 1. SOV 2.MOE and 3. UOA) on what a currency needs is boilerplate, I stand by those criteria as being needed for a currency to be effective in the long run. That does not mean that if something has those elements, it is sufficient in ensuring a currency is viable, but they are necessary. When you talk about history and how hard money wins over soft money, could you provide specific examples?
