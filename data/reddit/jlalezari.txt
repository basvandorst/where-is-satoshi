the short answer is roger ver... but to be a little more specific miners started mining bch because it was more profitable and that left btc with over 100,000 unconfirmed transactions

don't worry good sir just hodl

there are still over 100k unconfirmed transactions so the transaction fees are going to be really high for a bit. just wait until the market corrects itself

could be a couple hours or more

Roger Ver and his team "suspended" the s2x fork and then decided to pump a crap ton of money into bitcoin cash. bitcoin cash's price then went up so fast that the mining difficulty didn't have time to correct itself so bitcoin miners decided to start mining bitcoin cash instead because it was more profitable. because of that, bitcoin's price dropped significantly. but once bitcoin cash's price went sky rocketing, people started dumping all of their bitcoin cash which resulted in the price dropping nearly $1000 in the matter of minutes. however now that the pump and dump is over, mining bitcoin is back to being more profitable than mining bitcoin cash.
