The only reason I shop at Walmart, is because it is literally walking distance from my house. 20 mins to walk there, or maybe even 2 mins in the car.
I used to live next to a Fry's and I would go in there for random things...
But, when I buy what I need to eat and shit, I go to Sprouts which is twice the drive from Walmart. I can buy a ton of stuff like rice in bulk there and I like that. They also have pretty damn good prices on whole chickens (5 bucks) and other meats, so I buy bulk at sprouts. Their whole thing is they are a farmers market and have better product. I like shopping there. 
Sprouts makes me feel better about what I am buying. It's all garbage to me, I didn't grow it myself, but I currently live in a desert and do not have the time or means to have my own garden that can sustain me.

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) oooh, hey there Bitcoin, is that a rocket in your pocket or are you happy to see me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:14:54
Don't tease me sir, I can't take it.... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Image if you had like.... a couple billion dollars and happen to be bored and rich. Suddenly, you hear about something EVERYBODY IS NOW TOTALLY INTO.
Soooo, you buy a cool 200m.

Fuck yes!
I have been waiting for this for a while now.
Looks like I am making a road trip from Phoenix this weekend =)

In 2014 I was ranting and raving at my friend's and family about Bitcoin.
This year alone, even after the crash, I have close friends and family that buy a little here and there. My roommate has $200 in BTC, few others have $100 or so... My mom snatched up some back in 2014/2015 when it was 750 per, and recently sold a little to help pay a emergency bill.
Bitcoin works if you give it a chance. I use it as a store o value for the long term. I waste so much money on dumb shit like beer and weed.
At least Bitcoin has a chance to make ny future better. Maybe I can afford a lab grown liver when i am older with my Bitcoins

The real question is.. do you dislike Ford because your local peer group dislikes it and you are parroting what you have heard...
Or are you bias because you like a competitor more? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:47:38
Becaus e of my experience and perceptions on Bitcoin.
1. It's transportability: Banks use armored trucks to move how much money? Thats a lot of hands involved who get a cut.
2. It's decentralized: Nuff said.
3. No double spending: A peer to peer, public ledger? Fuck yes.
That's just a few simple reasons off the top of my head. Last election in the US Warren Buffet was siting on like 55 billion cash or something crazy. It cost him 25 million a day to secure, protect and transport that amount of cash.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:16:44
That's fair enough actually.
I'm a VW fan btw. Lol. Got a 87 GTI in the garage sir. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:34:31
Could you explain a little more? I was thinking of buying a little ETH here next pay check.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:37:53
I currently buy from  then have the bitcoins sent to my wallet on Kraken.
Recently switched to buying from glidera, and had been buying from circle before.I trade/store my coins on Kraken. I probably should get a trezor for storage...
I don't think Kraken will do what Crptsy and Gox did though... but hell what the fuck do I know. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:37:42
How does cash have a back up?
Bitcoins back up is its a technology that is open source and public. Bitcoin fails - Bitcoin 2.0 pops up.
You arguments and not very valid also. Saying that those who believe in Bitcoin are a small major.. that means nothing.
Bitcoin doesn't care about your opinions. Bitcoin is like a fucking honey badger. It does what it wants.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:26:00
I got lucky and jumped into bitcoin in 2011.
Had to sell a majority in 2015 to support myself while in school. Feels bad man =(. No big deal though, I have a little left, and now have the ability to pump 10% a paycheck into bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:11:25
I think we will see 50k before 2021.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:36:04
Okay so on the 30th of Dec, at 11:44 AM, I purchased .1 from Glidera.
Subtotal was $96.57
Fee was $2.08
Total was $98.65
I will be selling  .1 here in a day or two, so I will come back and post pictures and stuff of the sell of .1 BTC
Edit: Ha, guess I should start using imgr or something of the sort for picture posting. It's also taking a long time to get my bitcoins (purchased on 30th, get 6th) because I didn't verify my account properly before buying.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:42:10
Thank you for this explanation! 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:13:28
Naaa, back to 20k by this time next year or mid to early 2020.
Calling it now.
@_date: 2017-01-03 04:41:01
It is very easy to get into. Go to glidera.io, and buy directly with your bank account. Takes about 4 to 5 days ATM to get your bitcoins, after you purchase them.
Start a wallet on some where like Kraken, which is a pretty good exchange, and then just have the bitcoins you purchase sent from glidera.io to your kraken wallet.
Or just go with coinbase, and do all of that combined. Buy/sell/storage....
For longer term storage, get a hardware wallet called a trezor, and .... bam. That's pretty much it.

I try to buy 10% a pay check. Started this in 2014
@_date: 2017-01-08 09:11:46
I would be using them, but they don't do anything in Arizona yet.
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:43:52
I got into bitcoin in 2011.
My mom is the only person to listen to me what so ever, and buy any, and she bought last year 50 bucks, around the 600 dollar range.
All my other friends give me excuses about why they can't or won't buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:17:08
Find a website that will buy your bitcoins for gold.
Then sell your gold.
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:42:48
Have you tried out Gildera.io? I just started using them after circle closed down, and Kraken bought them out and is integrating their debit/bank buy stuff soonish.
So far i like what i see, but i have not bought from them via debit/bank yet.
@_date: 2016-12-25 02:44:06
Check out Gildera.io
@_date: 2016-12-08 03:40:00
And here I was thinking of getting in on this.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:41:21
Point taken sir.
I've only lost thousands so far.... I guess in the future as bitcoin rises I can then say I lost millions =D
I guess though, for me since I am not rich or wealthy, Ignorance is bliss(Though I bought 3 bitcoin for like 1400 or some shit and the price crashed right after ... that was my whole pay check and I was fucked. I have no idea how I would of handled it if that was my life savings lol.)
Edit: I bought 200 bitcoins for 14 bucks back in 2011... I bought things with those bitcoins and I wish I had not. 200 BTC's is a lot of fucking money right now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:48:45
I just picked up .2 when the price was at 5400 before the price rise and dip recently... did not sell on the dip. Also wasn't able to buy on the dip =(, but oh well. Still up this year.
Picked up a bitcoin in January for 938 dollars =D
Hodl 4 lyfe
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:54:36
I don't really let it get to me that I have chosen to waste money on drinking instead of buying Bitcoins...
But, it does drive me to stop drinking because I think back on how if I had just bought 1k+ USD in Bitcoins a year instead of fucking beer... I could be rich AND drink beer.
=(. I think I am about to finish my last beer.
!remindme 1 year
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:31:38
Let's just say I got into Bitcoin thanks to the silk road.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:46:37
Made first buy back in 2012, then 2014 ... and learned a huge lesson with a price crash =(, and since 2014 I try to buy at least 10% a pay check.
I don't make much, but uhh... yea. Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:51:22
I mined .003 back in 2011! 
It's neat because I remember it took a whole month for me to do so.
I wonder how much it cost me to mine that .003 Bitcoins, and if the price has gone above the price of the electricity used to create them. If so that is COOL AS FUCK.
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:41:36
Butt hurt much over being incorrect?

Quick Maphs.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:53:52
I use it. I use it to buy stuff actually. I try to buy 10% a paycheck. I then wait till I have enough to buy something I want, then I cash out and buy something that i needed.
This year, I was able to use my Bitcoin savings to switch jobs, take 3 weeks off for Christmas to visit a dying uncle, and still have a little left over to handle bills and shit.
Soo, you might not have any use for it... But fuck, it has sure been useful for me since I started using Bitcoin back in 2011.
Edit: I just try to Buy something of value and eventually when the price rises, sell it for something needed. Like paying off debt, or buying a backup engine for my vehicle. Buy some land while it's still affordable.... Recently Bitcoin has been decently predictable so it's been nice to buy dips.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:48:35
I just went with your statement of 'People don't use Bitcoin'. 
I get what you mean though, people can't use Bitcoins outright as many places...
But you still skipped over how I use Bitcoin is a store of value, instead of using a bank.
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:29:32
Why do you use a bank?
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:53:23
get the fuck out of here with your solid logic
