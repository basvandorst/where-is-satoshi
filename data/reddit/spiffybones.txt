Coinbase is fine, I don't see a problem in hodling there. / Also, they were investigating themselves. / Bittrex in chill too, haven't had any issues with them, but... if you want to convert/withdraw cash to bank, I believe only coinbase can do that at this time... unless, someone can prove me wrong? I'm gonna look into wallets later maybe exodus(desktop).
