I'm sure you didn't just suggest a Bitcoin CEO...you wouldn't dare.  Instead, you pointed out the problem with decentralization of the development of Bitcoin.  Decentralization isn't a magic bullet by itself, and in deadlocks like these a central voice providing guidance is needed, but there is no central authority by design.  It's Lord of the Flies time...gang warfare.  A dictatorship looks nice as well when everything is chaos...that's why dictators feed on destabilization.  Democracy is messy but still better than a dictatorship, and decentralized currency is still better than State-manipulated currency....but it's messy.  It looks to me like a repeat of ETH/ETC, but that was a completely different scenario.  I don't know what to do, so I'm going to do nothing...but hold and hope people will stop being shitheads and meet at a round table.

Ok, so that easy $1K floor was a good bet for now.  What random reason can we come up with this time?  Did China sneeze...Winklevosses won free donuts?

Sorry, I forgot the /s. I love (hate) how the news creates reasons for market movements after the fact like we all should have seen it coming.  I'm waiting for BU and core to have a beer together and the whole thing blows over and into our pockets.  Or not, and we just keep feeding a dead horse...

I've been playing some fun tricks shedding and buying dips, side-betting on alt-coins and such.  It's definitely fun but I have to admit, just holding this entire time would have been more profitable.  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop flipping bits though....There's no fun in just looking at a swimming pool.

I just layed off the markets for awhile during that time.  Came back here once the ball started rolling again about a year ago and saw everyone yelling at each other.  Conversations about market adoption were gone, hoarding ruled the land, *etc*.  It was a pretty stark difference.  I'm glad things are at least coming to a head...can we get back to taking over the financial sector again soon?

Not sure how relevant this is, but you reminded me of [this article]( saying Coinbase would *not* be on board with BU fork, at least not yet.  
I think your solution as an assumedly smaller business to hedge sounds wise, but can big exchanges handle both sides like that?  The article seems to hint that they couldn't afford the risk of holding a bunch of worthless coins.  
When ETH/ETC split I ended up with some left over remnants of ETC in GDAX (not enough to even trade), but they dumped it a couple months later. I don't think this issue is comparable enough to the ETH/ETC fork to make a direct comparison, but it's the only similar contentious fork I've experienced.  It wasn't pretty and I still have a bad taste in my mouth...not from the loss of a few dollars, but the loss of trust in the system itself.

Then finish the rest of the sentence.

We can catch those hills and valleys at the right time some of the time, but if we keep playing that game we'll get burned without a doubt: either holding the bag, panic twitch, or buying right before a crash.  I'm trying to hold longterm, but play the market with ~10%.  Anyone's guess, but simply holding is too boring...Holding is like buying a toy and keeping it on a shelf in its original packaging...pisses me off.

There was an Amazon (aws?) cloud outage today, I was wondering if that's connected to gdax going dark. Just got home and noticed.

Me too. Pretty much everyone sucks at timing the market.  I've been day-trading off an on for a few years.  You hit that sweet spot and think you've got some intuition, but over a few trades it's MORE likely you'll miss the opportunity and start getting jumpy at all market movements.  There's more gambling than investment involved, and you can always look backwards at the market and kick yourself, but that doesn't help looking forward.  I've been starting to hold a lot more, but still play the market for fun.

Like Fox is a conservative propaganda site, or MSNBC a liberal-propaganda site.  Ultimately pandering to their side of the story, with some legit news.

Fun part is I'm pretty sure even Trump has no idea what he's actually going to do.  If bitcoin becomes a solid side-step of remittance restrictions in a media-public way, it could shake things up, but not sure how much in a good way.  Could bring further regulation on BTC itself.

Sorry: Shift card.  Maybe not using BTC literally, but it deducts from my BTC balance.  It's very useful when I'm feeling like turning bitcoin into food.
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:04:02
Thanks for noticing!  Trying to stay positive and not get sucked into sideline fights.  To be fair, calling it a "BTC card" was kind of a honeypot :).  
I think of the Bitcoin community like [Lord of the Flies](  The downside to decentralization is the mob mentality and a natural tendency to split into factions, filling the void that a central authority would normally fill.  Problem is Bitcoin is still a fledgling technology, so all the in-fighting about tidbits hurts everyone and really slows adoption.  
Imagine being interested in Bitcoin and coming to or and seeing chairs and bottles being thrown around.  Back away slowly...the Bitcoin freaks are in civil war!

Also spelled Commander wrong.  Or not?  I can't tell anymore, the world is backwards lately.

They limited my deposit limit to $5 per day without warning, so I could only put $5 in my wallet at a time, which is pretty much useless.  When I submitted a support ticket they took off the limit after about a week, but refused to give me a reason why my account was essentially locked down, saying something along the lines of "it could have happened for any number of reasons".  While my account was locked and I hadn't heard from them yet, I noticed it would still allow me to withdraw, so in a panic I took everything out until it was resolved, and it was a pretty bad time to be selling...I didn't know what else to do.  I still use Coinbase despite this very troubling incident, but I don't keep as much btc with them as before out of caution.  I'd say anything over a couple grand is worth owning yourself.  I actually purchase things with Coinbase, not use it as a savings/investment account, so the convenience of having btc available with them is worth it, but I'm definitely not happy with them overall.

I usually just use online wallet with purchases like Overstock or Newegg, but every once in awhile having the card is fun.  My favorite website to buy frivilous stuff (Massdrop) used to accept BTC but stopped a year or so ago, which is a shame.  My business accepts BTC as well, but the conversation and purpose of bitcoin has shifted to investment, and I don't see the market adoption I enjoyed watching and taking part in a couple years ago.
@_date: 2016-12-27 00:10:35
I understand you don't like Coinbase, but that's my choice for payment processor.  I had a feeling I would get negative responses but still enjoy using and investing in bitcoin.  If you want the technology to succeed, I think services like Coinbase are a good way for people to get into the ecosystem.

Only 3 left in stock!  Get yer bitcoin fork pen!  It's on sale for only....whaaa?!

Take a look at the creator of LTC's (Charlie Lee) twitter: 
He talks about activation pretty often, and would be the best person to follow for updates.

That whole Craig Wright episode still has me saying "hmmm".  Nothing really adds up.  
I think at least you can say that Gavin is earnest and doing what he thinks is right, regardless of whether you agree with him 100%.  There are lots of people with their hands in the pie I trust much less.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:30:12
Did you hear this, China-bots?!  We want bitcoin fork with trezor, not a pen, please!  Would it survive a couple accidental trips in soup and through the washing machine?
