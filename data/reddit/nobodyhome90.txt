That sounds fair 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:36:06
I have an idea. 1 BTC to each r/bitcoin subscriber :) afterall, we as a whole help push the price and success of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:28:30
So pissed I didn't get a few at 50 bucks each. Don't wanna spend 150 now smh 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:19:02
Oh there's never enough we all know that 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:02:12
That is probably most certain. But by average I mean adding up everyone's amounts and dividing by the amount of people in the sub. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:31
If you envy others that's on you. There's plenty of people with more BTC than me, and plenty with less, and even more with zero. It's all good.

When I think of the possibility that we are at the brink of a financial revolution I begin to think that maybe I'm just really delusional. I hope not though.

Found the whale. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:09:28
Show me where in my post did I ask how much do you or any one person in particular has. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:04:08
It would be impossible to divulge the information since it's only an opinion on the average amount lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:45:39
That's the never enough feeling right there lol I have it too. In my opinion that's relatively substantial, and definitely way more than the average person in general nowadays who probably has zero. Still early! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:02:38
What's your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:30:05
Oh I'm sure many of us do. But if more people owned a whole bitcoin, then many of them would use some of it to trade for altcoins which would only expedite the adoption of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:03:07
Doesn't matter at all. Nothing wrong with curiousity and opinions though. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:13:33
You might own significantly more or significantly less than the average person... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:38:11
Fact = certain truth. Opinion = just a thought that may or may not be true. No one knows everyone's amounts. But everyone can have an opinion on the average. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:00
Ahh shitt I need to make a few trades into alts and I need it to be at 17000.. better go back up by later today

Then it seems unusual. I also have a balance of about $50 on my Copay wallet, but for some reason I'm not seeing a balance when I check my Copay address on blockchain. Copay had that balance for almost 2 weeks btw if that matters. Any possible reasons? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 02:35:54
I'd be able to pay off the card, and I'd be okay with 3k less, although it would really suck. That's why I figured in my situation it makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:05:17
How would it help with poloniex? (Don't know much about it) 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:32:24
What if you use a non-exchange wallet like copay, electrum, etc, would transactions and balances show up on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:33:30
Great insight. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:31:44
When buying with a linked bank account, they tell you that you'll receive the bitcoins in 7 days and send an email with the specific date that you'll receive them by. Is this date usually accurate? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:38:51
Wow had no idea
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:31:37
Wasn't aware of that about the addresses, still a bit new to bitcoin. I do see the old and new addresses though, makes sense. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:36:46
Wait hold on, I'm still kind of new to bitcoin..What does 2X and 1X mean exactly? And how would that affect the amount of bitcoin/USD that I have? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:11:00
How about just using Tor. Would that bypass the restriction? 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:06:06
What if you keep all your bitcoins in a separate non-exchange wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:08:14
Does that apply to all wallets? (Copay wallet balance is showing 0 on blockchain too) 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:09:02
Been thinking of doing that for a month already fml. Legit about to just do it. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:44:25
Is setting up a VPN a solution? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:23:48
I have a copay wallet on my phone that I'm thinking of transferring the balance from Coinbase into. But I'm considering downloading Electrum on my computer and transferring everything into that. Would that be a better idea than the Copay app wallet on my phone? And if I transfer, would I have to import with a private key from Copay or just send them from one wallet to the other? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:04:30
Inspiring. Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:10:20
Is it better to buy smaller amounts over longer periods of time or in bulk but more rarely? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 03:32:39
Thanks guys! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:08:12
Is this real life? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:31:22
It worked! Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:21:49
If I enable it, Copay doesn't let me buy bitcoin (through coinbase). Would the solution be to enable 2FA and just use coinbase directly to buy and then send to my Copay wallet?
