The big miners are not losing money or else they would not be mining...
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:07:48
Even in the short term, they would temporarily shut down. It makes no sense to mine bitcoin at a loss when you can simply purchase it on an exchange. A while back I was mining an alt currency across 10,000 server instances and I had them automatically set up to shut down while it was not profitable based on the current exchange rate and the amount they mined over the last 12 hours.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:04:58
But what would happen to the value of bitcoin and why would it exist at that point?
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:12:07
Not a production web or database server especially like Coinbase
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:12:36
How many confirmation are required for deposits to show up?

I can't think of many things I'd rather not have than a Facebook bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:45:59
Obviously hard to say but with how easy it is to securely hash passwords these days you would definitely hope they aren't using MD5 or similar
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:36:42
You just click File &gt; Save and then yes you now have an offline version of it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 20:26:38
If it is actually encrypted with just those numbers you don't need to enter them through a user interface, just grab the database and start cracking.

I hope I'm not coming across as rude, but I just wanted to bring it up since it is hurting your site's SEO. On the "Contracts" page you should be using text instead of the images. This is because Google really likes seeing content and can't index the text in those images. It will help your ranking having that extra content indexed (and they appear blurry for me).
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:36:01
Wouldn't entering the private key directly into Coinbase through their "Import Paper Wallet" page be enough? And if it is BIP38 encrypted you can use bitaddress.org to get the plaintext first
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:21:34


I'm sorry but you don't know what a cookie is. There is no such thing as a "basic cookie". A cookie contains exactly what the developer puts in it and nothing more, nothing less. It also can't contain any more information than **you** give the website. Yes some cookies are encrypted and you can't directly view the data but that is for **your protection**. If a site needs to store something sensitive in a cookie like a session ID then they might choose to then encrypt that but that is just so somebody can't open your computer and steal that information (or through an XSS attack).


Pseudoanonymous means that the cookie can identify you in such a way that says "yes, that person has been here before and they searched for socks." Anonymous would be "I don't know if that person has ever been here before, and there is no way to tell". No anonymity would be "yes, Bob Teller who lives at 1111 Beach Way Ave was here last night at 11pm and searched for socks".


Really, you browse daily with Javascript turned off? You are an idiot. Do you also have Local Storage turned off? What about Flash cookies? And the 8 other ways to easily store information about you and track you...


And they don't need to. What are you so concerned that a search engine is saving in a cookie? Your DOB, SSN, middle name? Well, did you give the site that information? No... okay then they can't be storing it in a cookie in the first place. What they are likely storing is information about what previous products you have viewed in a **pseudoanonymous fashion**. Why would you care if they know you visited last week and searched for something, and now you are back on the site? Websites use that information to show you more relevant products and also provide more targeted advertising. You may not like advertising but lets be honest - websites wouldn't exist if they weren't making money. Being shown ads in return for a service like spendabit is really not such a terrible thing.
Btw, [here are the two cookies that are stored by spendabit.co]( The first one (_ga) is your standard Google Analytics tracking cookie. Website owners use this to see how many views they are getting and for website optimization. The second one (JSESSIONID) is another standard cookie created by JSP that would just help keep track of your session. So if you logged in and came back later the site could still identify you, that sort of thing.

The server needs the plaintext to hash it. The best practice is use SSL to avoid MITM and to do logins over POST.

I'm playing right now and why is the reward not increasing when more people guess? It is stuck at .0014...

It says specifically no bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-04-04 08:11:18
There is fiat money and there is commodity money. The US dollar doesn't have any intrinsic value so it is fiat money, not commodity by the standard definition. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:22:01
It is an HTML file, so you would use a browser... and you don't need "offline mode"

It's not ugly it's broken :/ But if Calc can't parse JSON that is probably the best
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:29:18
If it is a common password and they are hashed with MD5 then sure. If they are salted and hashed with SHA256/SHA512 then absolutely not.

No, you misread his comment, he is saying the opposite :P

Email leaks? This isn't sent from Gox servers, you can fake from addresses

You are based in the US, calling yourself a mutual fund, gone through no regulatory steps, and are actually asking people for money? What a terrible, terrible idea.
@_date: 2014-07-06 00:52:10
Absolutely, and my comment wasn't meant to be offensive to any developers working at that rate but I was just noting that would be considered very cheap for a good developer.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:47:47
I didn't request that.
edit: I still don't agree with your comment though. Prices should be able to be set in any local currency, it doesn't have to be USD only.

Oh god, look at the page source. The website was built with [Wix](

I sent a pull request on github a few days ago that reduces the number of queries done to get products by around 80%. Are pull requests welcome right now?
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:55:10
Yes, I understand English
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:25:51


Oh c'mon
@_date: 2014-07-09 02:35:03
You seem so worried about your privacy and cookies, but you don't even know what a cookie is. It is a file stored on your computer. If you want to know what is in it you open that file and you look. Cookies are really only used for keeping track of you in a pseudoanonymous way. The site knows stuff about you because of your cookies, but only information you shared. If you don't want to share that information (such as products you've looked at which could be used to feed you ads or previous visits) then disable cookies, turn off Javascript, and use a VPN. Stop being so confrontational about something you clearly know nothing about. The privacy policy is not meant to be a how to guide on basic internet things.

He buys bitcoin with coinbase, and then spends it?
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:18:18
Well I sent .01 BTC to the address it supplied and there are currently 2 confirmations but when I refresh the page it just says to make a deposit. I'm logged in and I'm at the URL it said I need to be at. [here is the transaction](
@_date: 2014-04-12 20:57:46
Have you previously had fake bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:47:14
If somebody was that concerned about not revealing their first and last names they could 1) not ever have given it to Coinbase because it isn't required and 2) use different email addresses. And actually yes there was an agreement, look at the [Privacy Policy](
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:05:48
You mean dorians?
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:58:37
How is this at all related to their wallet? This is a documented API call for sending invoices. You and a large portion of the rest of this sub are blowing this out of proportion mainly because you don't understand it.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:55:29
I'm calm it was just a question. To answer yours the answer is that the price is worth whatever a buyer and a seller can agree upon.
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:13:49
Leaked is very misleading. More like 'found online elsewhere and tried to request money to see if they are a Coinbase user'.
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:16:53
Yeah Olaf and I go all the time
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:06:14
It is only $10,000, what is illegal about this?

Why aren't they transparent?
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:52:43
Why are you replying to yourself...
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:33:06
Yes the background, usually for icons they are transparent. You can't simply remove the background that easily because artifacting makes it not a pure white, [here is a screenshot in Photoshop]( for example showing that removing the white background is not that simple and will degrade the image. Thanks for posting I'm just saying they'd be a lot more useful if they were transparent.

Bought the four pack to support a fellow Bitcoin-accepting merchant
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:37:28
Yes they can inject code into the one in the Droid market. The only "truly secure" way of using this app would be to audit all of the code, all of the code from the libraries it uses, every app on your phone, and the Android operating system itself. And then you still wouldn't be secure because your phone probably has an internet connection which is a huge attack vector right there. But realistically, just build the APK yourself and compare checksums with the one on the market.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:57:02
Sure you can hash it with JS, but it is bad practice for a few different reasons.
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:38:56
That isn't what this 'leak' was about, the OP has said this list was created using the method previously disclosed which first requires an email address and then gives their full name. I have a feeling you probably have used that email address elsewhere and that it is just a coincidence you are getting spammed today.
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:07:04
I asked them a few months about doing what you suggested, that is have a market maker discount. They said they weren't interested, even for extremely high volume so I had them close my account.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:55:57
Woohoo the more tea the better, thanks
@_date: 2014-10-05 07:53:51
Being open source doesn't mean it magically supports plugins
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:13:41
Do you mean race condition? How does SQL solve this problem?
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:57:43
Only up to $1000 weekly..
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:50:39
It isn't "if they could truly pull this off" it is as easy as taking the code from the open source repository, changing it, building it, and then uploading it. There is nothing tricky about it... Same for all open source websites it is not like there is any guarantee the code they are running is the code in their repository. This is why most trusted web-based applications for generating keys are written in Javascript so you can download it yourself from the site and compare checksums. If you have a dedicated phone for this I would factory reset it and then put the app on it and you are probably fine.
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:56:08
Its called a scam, stop opening these emails immediately 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:28:13
Right their first and last name, given an email address they already chose to share publicly.
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:11:21
Additions through pull requests on Github, yes. But again plugins are entirely different and something doesn't have to be open source to support plugin development. In this case it is open source and doesn't support plugins
@_date: 2014-03-13 17:35:56
Yes, which 877Kb is getting close to
@_date: 2014-07-02 07:49:31
Sounds like her Authy account was compromised which makes me think she used the same password as another account that might have been hacked. Which would lead me to believe it was also her Coinbase password. This doesn't sound like a Coinbase problem. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:27:56
Okay good I see it now. Took probably about 20 minutes after the first confirmation, are you using a callback from a third-party service or just checking every X minutes?
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:54:26
Doesn't mean anything, when doing automated emails you can put whatever you want in the "From" line

He should be generating new addresses for each transaction, so this is a pretty bad idea.

Getting people to pay for your product through a method they are already familiar with is hard enough, asking them to do the steps you just listed would be impossible.

A really bad developer
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:09:39
Well no I said Javascript and not Java since it is the only programming language on the web that is client side. But Android apps are written in Java and like I said you can check the code and build it yourself and that is fine. Personally what I do is use an offline version of bitaddress.org (save HTML file on flash drive) to generate keys on an offline computer (running an Ubuntu live CD) and then I print those keys and scan the addresses them from my Coinbase wallet to deposit into cold storage. When I want to move them back into my Coinbase account I'll use their paper wallet import feature. This way my private keys are never shared with any code I can't see at the time of execution and they have never been connected to the internet until the time I want to sell all my bitcoin associated with that key.

The website owner (or an attacker with server access - at which point you have bigger problems) could still put Javascript on the page to intercept the form, or there could be an XSS vuln that an attacker abuses that does the same which is probably what the person you replied to was referring to. But the answer is that in practice the website owner wouldn't be using recurly in the first place if they were malicious and that as a user you just have to hope there are no XSS vulnerabilities - but at that point there is really nothing recurly could do to make this process 100% safe. To be clear I'm not knocking the service just giving a web dev's answer to the question.
