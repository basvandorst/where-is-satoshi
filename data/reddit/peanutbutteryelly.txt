The split was just a nice dividend. And it lower our overall risk because of the extra cash.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:20:50
The price has already corrected during the segwit split uncertainty for months, now the only thing btc wants to do is go home to the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:19:45
Welcome on board.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:34:23
Selling 1 yr later is not hodl
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:11:05
If it was not that segwit uncertainty in the past months that had slow down the growth, BTC would have been half way to the moon right now.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:39:04
Thats why you only invest money you can lose, then you have less fear. What if it never goes back to 3k again?
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:10:47
What bubble? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:54:54
The exitplan is to forget I have ever bought bitcoins for the next 10 years.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:23:09
This article is too convincing, I'm gonna unload my bitcoins now.
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:44:24
A small correction is normal, it shakes those sellers out and fill it up with new hodlers.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:42:33
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:01:28
No I kept both
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:08:19
Lets get 10k
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:50:31
I will HODL even if its at 50000. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:35:43
I opened an account at Coinbase and I couldnt confirm my creditcard. I emailed their customer service, twice! Never got a reply.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:22:55
I feel sorry for those that did not HODL
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:08:56
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:08:56
To the mooooon we gooooooo....
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:07:04
Wait for the next correction, then its our last chance to buy before it becomes too expensive.
@_date: 2017-08-13 04:50:37
Never sell
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:12:27
Dont see it as 0.62 btc because the price is 4000+ today. You will think differently if you imagine that it will be 100.000 one day.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:10:30
Now you can borrow to buy 1btc and payback slowly. But once it hits 10k, you can dream about 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:53:32
The best investment tip I can give you is HODL and then forget you had ever bought BTC. Like buying a car, are you gonna sell tomorrow because the price got a little bit cheaper? No. Then build a small budget of 2k or more in the following months/year and buy more in case BTC drops. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:11:54
You just lost me there.
@_date: 2017-08-14 06:08:57
Compare the prices, if you buy at playforms that sells directly without verification, there are usually higher fees.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:03:53
My trezor wallet is coming today, I will have everything transferred.
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:48:48
Now hold until you are at the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:42:48
Here we go again...
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:26:16
What are you planning to mine?
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:21:27
Most 'well researched' articles are just opinions and you can come up with the biggest reasons yourself. Just like companies and their stocks, there is a long road ahead to meet their goals which is increase profits, margin, marketshare etc... this road is full of traps, so its not an easy ride. The same with bitcoins, we are heading to the moon but there are difficulties. In every winning obstacle, bitcoin will increase in price. If bitcoin is certain to hit 5k in 10 years, then you wouldnt pay the current price now. So are going to stay on earth or do you want to jump in the train to the moon. The decision is yours. And oh yes, the secret code is hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:16:58
First of all, to go from 4k to $1 dollar, means something really bad must have happened. And all the people that have bought the btc will be affected as well as the exchanges etc...
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:17:07
bitcoin will go up the more people learn about it. And there is no barrier ahead for now.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:25:20
Bitcoin cant grow that high without updates. By the time it hits 1 mil per bit, we will have lower fees and faster transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:53
A normal correction after much increase and you are selling?
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:40:40
You buy what you can lose and you hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:10:30
Now you can borrow to buy 1btc and payback slowly. But once it hits 10k, you can dream about 1 btc.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:16:20
You left a 0, 2018: 70000
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:55:31
But how can anyone know the private key if he is the real owner and never told anyone?
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:27:14
I just buy and think about the 100k future value
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:31:00
Its time to plant your seeds guys, this is the moment. Buy nd Hodl we shall.
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:07:44
The cash in your bank is not really yours, its at someone else control but bitcoin its yours becuz you have full control over it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:06:10
Give the community more details. Where did you store it, when was it lost? Etc...
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:36:05
No ico is banned not btc
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:56:54
Hodl and just bought 1 more
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:08:11

@_date: 2017-09-21 00:48:15
No this time is different. Check Ethereum as an example.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:56:54
