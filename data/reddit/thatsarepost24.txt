Trezor etc.

Oh I understand what you're saying. 
Yes it definitely could go down 9k 5k 200 dollars. Whatever. My statement was basically that in the history of bitcoin it's gone up. And if you beleive in it's future than anytime is the right time to buy.

@_date: 2019-08-07 15:17:16
I didn't see the trade. How much was it?
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:39:26

@_date: 2019-08-09 16:21:58

@_date: 2019-08-06 22:08:25

Just hodl. There only exists like 2 weeks out of all bitcoin where if you bought you are not profitable now.
If you believe in bitcoins future then just buy and hodl.

My coworkers are starting to ask for advice again after I told them to buy at 4k
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:38:47
Which time
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:09:35
Oh shit. He's right. I just sold. Bye Btc
@_date: 2019-12-31 15:23:06
But you're right. If a Bitcoin is with 1 mil or whatever in the future then that 15 bucks is 1500 a month
Depends on what you see Bitcoin doing in the future.
@_date: 2019-12-31 15:18:24
But in all reality what's my gtx 2080 going to net me after electricity costs. I think it's 15 bucks a month before
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:39:28
I always buy 6 hours after I buy because it's gauratneed to go down
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:13:05
"only 2-3 a month."
I know hindsight is always 20/20 but my God
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:40:32
Haven't touched my bitcoin in over a year. Just keep adding
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:57:07
/s hopefully
