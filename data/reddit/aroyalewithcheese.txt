Wrong. If you sell your BTC for 20k, someone else is buying them for that amount. There is no money leaving.

I don't know who you replied to, but, the value of gold is no different than the value of any other thing. It is relatively scarce and there is demand for it, thus, it becomes valuable. Like everything else in the world it has no intrinsic value, it's just simple supply and demand.  
Although, the very long history of gold as a form of currency does make it more unique than most other currencies. The simple fact that it's managed to be considered valuable for thousands of years is pretty amazing and reinforces the idea (some would say illusion) that it has value.  
Everything is just supply and demand.

Nah, it's different around here. Credit cards aren't the norm and neither is getting loans or being in debt for every expense. You just pay with your bank card with the money you actually have. 99% of (Dutch) online stores accept iDeal.

I did some research and it seems it's just the Rotterdam hotel. This is because it's recently been aquired by a new franchisee that probably implemented bitcoin payment.

Nah, a real hotel just weird description. They don't even have any windowless rooms.

It's 100% genuine, since I've already booked the place and it's a legitimate hotel that just happens to accept bitcoin, awesome.

Go via their own website, not one of those sites that lists all hotels.

I'm sad to disappoint but I really haven't seen any stores accepting Bitcoin. I do live, however, in the east of the country nowhere near any big city like Amsterdam so I can't really say much about those places. 
As usual, it seems we Dutchies will catch-up with the U.S. way later.

Yes, let us *somehow* create an official logo for a *decentralized* currency that has no *governing body* watching over it. The whole idea of an "official" logo is just completely silly. Whatever the large payment processors start using is going to be what the logo and symbol of Bitcoin becomes.

You're wrong, formatting is not the same as wiping a drive. Formatting will remove data, but a very large portion of it will be recoverable. 
Writing over the drive completely (which usually takes the better part of a day) even once, will make more or less all of the data nigh-irrecoverable. Maybe some fancy government equipment and a lot of man-hours could get some back, we don't really know, but in any other case the data is just gone.

It is. It has pretty much the lowest entry-barrier short of being given a Bitcoin wallet by a friend. If you want to trade and buy Bitcoin cheaply, use Coinbase's exchange called GDAX.
You can transfer fiat money which you have on Coinbase for free to GDAX. Coinbase charges at least 1.5% to buy Bitcoin with USD. On GDAX you pay a 0.25% fee for market orders and no fee when you're a maket ket maker.

I actually earn a living by buying broken drives in bulk and mining the data on them. It's pretty amazing what kind of stuff you find and the payout is great.

No problem, happy to help out. Everyone has to start somewhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:51:05
As much as you want. GDAX is Coinbase, just a different user-interface. You'll notice the HTTPS certificate on GDAX even says "Coinbase". So you can freely transfer FIAT between Coinbase and GDAX, in whatever composition you like.

Yeah, let's be realistic here, age is not the determining factor. I know plenty of teenagers and young adults how barely know how to use the internet in general and have no interest in crypto whatsoever.
On the other hand, I know plenty old people who are geeks and still love new technology and are very interested in crypto.
It's pretty arrogant to think all young people are good with tech. I guess most young people don't realise how many older people are on the internet and older people probably don't see the need to proclaim their age constantly either.

This is a good thing for the adoption of Bitcoin, but be aware, on the short term this will increase volatility. A lot of this new money will be coming from new, inexperienced, "investors".
Especially with the concerns around tether and this long rally we've been on, once the price starts dropping there will be many weak hands selling. This will exponentially increase any price drop that might happen. If any bad news around tether comes out, these new people will be scared out of Bitcoin in the blink of an eye.
Of course, we don't know if there will be bad news; we don't know if and when this price rally will end either. But when it does, the decline will be at least as fast (and probably a lot faster) as the increase has been.

GDAX is the exchange run by Coinbase. GDAX doesn't have a mobile app, though, only a website.

It's not FUD if it's legitimate criticism of a very shady seeming practice. It just took a while for people to give a shit.

This is a huge sell signal, but damn, the trend is so strong I'm not sure when the crash will happen. For all I know, it migh go to 20k before this dumb money is shaken out. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:54:35
The other comment is wrong. You can transfer money to Coinbase whatever way you like. If you transfer USD, for example, you will have "X" amount of USD in your Coinbase account. GDAX *is* Coinbase as well, so a transfer to GDAX is instantaneous and comeplety free. You can then use your USD to buy Bitcoin on the GDAX market, which is cheaper than buying on Coinbase (1.5% fee instead of no 0.25% or no fee on GDAX).  
So: 
1. Transfer USD to Coinbase however you like. CC is quickest but most expensive. 
2. Move USD from Coinbase to GDAX immediately and without fees (same company). 
3. Buy Bitcoin on GDAX for no, or low fees.

Cryptocurrencie wallets are a large source of income. Besides that: a lot of client information from businesses (which can be sold to advertisers), classified company information (sold to competitors), credit card information, blackmail of all kinds (sold to strategy/lobbying companies). This stuff is very varied and almost all information is worth something to the right person.

Luckily BTC has a big enough market to absorb it. As soon as the price gets close to 4000, there's huge orders. Get in the vicinity of three or two thousand and you can dumb a million BTC and the market will still absord it.
Sure, the price then drops by 50-80% but that'll only last for a short time before the market recovers when the large influx of coins stop. It actually seems like a dream, the possibility of buying BTC for less than three thousand.

Well, you know, if you have the private keys you control the wallet. So it's basically like finding cash on the ground.

Probably because the vast majority of people are simply incompetent. For most people, a reputable company like Coinbase with checks and balances and multiple factors of protection (password, 2fa, etc.) is a lot safer than having their keys on their PC.

So I should sell before Bitcoin goes mainstream, becomes widely accepted and rises to untold highs as institutional investors start using Bitcoin? Got it. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:53:14
It's not exactly how bubbles work. Inherently, a bubble is empty, there's nothing of value in it. One could argue that Bitcoin can't be a bubble since the technology and implementation have intrinsic value.
In this scenario, the higher the price rises the better, as it only solidifies Bitcoin's position within the market. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 07:51:17
Bitcoin is just as infinite in supply, practically speaking. If demand rises, Bitcoin prices rise, 0.1 becomes worth what a 1 Bitcoin was worth last week, then 0.01, then 0.001. It's pretty much inflation.

Healthcare varies largely by country in europe. However, in The Netherlands Healthcare that covers mostly everything will cost you about €150 a month. You have a mandatory "personal risk" or deductible of €360 a year which you can increase up to €800 to lower your monthly cost.  
Most essential things are completely covered by insurance. Things like the dentist and orthodontics are usually only covered up to a certain amount or for 75% even with the best insurances. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:20:38
It depends on the wallet. It needs to be offline, in the sense that you get full control of your coin and keys. Coinbase holds your bitcoin for you, so they can technically take it away. With an simple and userfriendly offline wallet like Exodus you have all the control over your crypto.

Ibreally don't know what countries you're talking about. Western europe, the countries where highly qualified workers such as developers will go, aren't comparable to the eastern european countries.  
College graduates generally start out around €2000 a month, minimum. University graduates are around the same minimum. However, someone like a fiscal law lawyer will have an 80% job guarantee in the first 6 months after *graduating* with an average pay of about €3000-3500 for his very first year. 
A friend of mine just graduated from university with some sort of business IT degree, he got a job before he even graduated. He's paid just under €3000 a month, many benefits, shitload of holidays and a company car. 
€25000 for highly skilled and/or educated workers in Western europe is absolutely nothing.

"Europe" is a very, very vague term when describing econonical welfare. Sure, in Croatia or Poland €25000 is pretty decent. In The Netherlands, however, you'd be barely above minimum wage.
