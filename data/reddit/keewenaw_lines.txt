Very short answer:
1) Larger blocks make it more difficult to mine - miners must consider more inputs when trying to find a valid solution for the next block. This means fewer miners have the computational resources to continue, which eventually yields centralization (the antithesis of Bitcoin's "founding principles").
2) Continuously increasing block size is not scalable long-term. It's a short-term fix. Otherwise, how can the average user with a full node handle the storage/processing requirements of what could  eventually turn into 1 GB+ blocks? We can't just keep increasing the block size every time we have congestion issues, so a different (eg, off-chain) solution becomes necessary.
Edit: grammar

Your information on the halving is wrong. Halvings happen every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years). The last one [happened at block height 420,000]( on July 9th, 2016. The price then was about [$650 USD]( That's a \~12x in price since then. The one before that, block 210,000, was on November 28th, 2012 ([price of \~$12]( $12 to $650 is \~54x. Although past performance doesn't indicate future returns, all the data we have shows a significant increase in value between halvings. He's saying that in two more halvings, he believes his holdings will be enough to buy a house, ideally by trading the BTC directly for the deed.

Satoshi himself claimed it was equally worthy of being a store of value or replacement to gold. See:
* [Aug 27th, 2010]( "Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock. More like a collectible or **commodity**."
* [Feb 18th, 2009]( "In this sense, **it's more typical of a precious metal**. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases."
* [July 6th, 2010]( "**Escape the arbitrary inflation risk*** of centrally managed currencies!  Bitcoin's total circulation is limited to 21 million coins."
He even explicitly stated that Bitcoin was founded on both principles on [Aug 27th, 2010](
If people want to sit here and argue that Bitcoin is supposed to be a medium of exchange, fine. But to deny that Bitcoin can't also be a SoV is wrong, especially when Satoshi said it can be both himself.

I work in IT security consulting and have done so for 10+ years, so this is right up my alley. 
This would be a major finding, but unfortunately I do agree this is not a Critical issue. If I'm understanding what you're reporting, you would need to already have valid credentials to fully bypass authentication, as you mention inputting a valid password to view the codes. It's not like your issue completely bypasses the auth workflow and allows arbitrary account access - THAT would be a next-level fuckup. This specific attack could be paired with a brute-force attempt to really do some damage but is not in and of itself the sole method of compromise, which is usually the delineation between a High and Critical severity finding. 
I would highly advise you to read the OWASP Risk Rating guide [here]( Specifically, check out "Threat Actors - Opportunity" and "Technical Impact - Loss of Accountability" for why this isn't a Critical.
However, bypassing 2FA is a significant finding and $50 is too low for this.

Assuming that OTC market sellers are miners, that's why the halving matters. Sure, they sell 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes. What about after the halving, when there's 6.25, or in 2024 when it's 3.125? By that logic, OTC volume will eventually dry up. 
Even including institutions and early adopters that want to liquidate, eventually everyone who wants to sell will. That's the joy of a capped supply - you can't sell more than 21MM BTC. Even if that price is lower than now, true believers will buy at price points they find attractive, even if it's one guy buying all 21 million at $0.0001. I hereby offer to do this, of course. And I'm not alone, so eventually, at some unknown price, more buyers will exist than sellers, then the price goes up again. More coins in the hands of strong holders and all that.
Fundamentally, this is why Bitcoin is a long-term play. None of this will play out in days or weeks, but decades.

Bcash split from Bitcoin in 2017. Bcash itself later split into two chains, Bcash ABC (BCH) and Bcash Satoshi's Vision (BSV). If you held Bcash at Coinbase during the hardfork date, you now have equal amounts of BCH and BSV. Coinbase doesn't support BSV, so they're telling you that you now have access to it, but have to move it from Coinbase to actually trade it.

I bought my first coins from a classmate in my program who mined in the CPU days, before dollar parity. He eventually got out of Bitcoin completely, and I purchased a good chunk of his remaining lot. He spent the rest on Silk Road for weed and LSD, said he wanted something out of it. He never truly believed in the concept, just thought it was a fun computer science project. A lot of the really old buyers were like me, just buying from friends and random dudes in the space that were baffled that we wanted to pay anything for them. My friend legit bragged to others the first time I bought that he screwed me over because I wanted to pay anything for these stupid little tokens. 
I never mined myself because - I shit you not - I wanted to learn Jamaican patois and the client was making it hard for me to run multiple programs at once.

Why the drop today? Not sure. Just asked myself, is the long term thesis of BTC intact? I think so - in the short term it's even improved with the collapse of S2X. I still believe in the long term benefit of BTC, so why not take advantage of any weakness in price? Let the weak hands sell, I'll keep buying.

Crosspost of my observation in Sometimes I wonder if we have reached peak adoption or exposure. Then I talk about [Bitcoin in other places on Reddit]( and get bulldozed with downvotes in minutes. No one takes it seriously; it's "speculation" or a "Ponzi scheme".
Fundamentally, sentiment among your average person is shit. Just serves to tell me BTC has a lot farther to go in terms of adoption - it still has a chance. When random comments like the one I made above get voted to the top of a thread consistently, like in Dec 2017, then it's time to get scared again.

As a security measure, it's probably better to create a new wallet. Not sure why reusing seeds would be a good idea - if your old app has a security vulnerability that means your keys got leaked, would you prefer your attackers only had access to an old empty wallet, or to everything you're holding? It's well worth the tiny transaction fees to protect yourself.
