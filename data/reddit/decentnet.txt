For the ones of us that are trying hard to hold it ... I say best is to decide on a good lower limit / panic sale price limit like $10000 / btc and not sell any sooner than that. 
It is always ups and downs and is best to keep this in mind always and don't make any plans with the money while price is temporary high.

Wow these countries seem like the most corrupt you can find. 
I wonder if anyone paid them to ban Bitcoin and cause price drops.

I don't expect just 1-2 to try it, just if we all agree that this is a good ideea. &lt; I will add this to the topic.

Would be great but if true but I think money/BTC is more direct and convincing.

Maybe some do have bitcoins, but I think most of them didn't understand it enough to buy some (receiving for free is much better). And if they directly profit from price drop then I assume they were already bribed for it; they have no reason not to collect some free BTC, no ?

I would still be interested in why you think it would not work.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:32:18
Yup , one way to look at it :)

Why wouldn't it work ?
