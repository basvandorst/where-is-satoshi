This I agree with with the exception that some parties are long term motivated and may operate at a loss for the greater long term success. Perfect example would be Uber over Lyft, they operated at a loss for a long time to ensure dominance over the bigger market in the long term. I 100% independent miners will follow price, but we already have seen certain parties operate at a loss for a more grand plan than day by day profits.
Now I am not a coder nor into the tech but I believe in what BTC represents and 2x is not it, I personally think that a well coordinated attack with enough resources behind them could be very detrimental and create a self fulfilling prophecy.
After all most of the money in BTC is new comers and now we even have CME introducing futures 2 days prior to the fork... They use a formula that is based on weight based trading at 4 exchanges if I'm correct: Gemini, GDAX, ITbit, and BitStamp.
These exchanges have stated (At least some of them that they will consider the BTC ticker the chain with the most accumulated difficulty) And after how long? 24-72 hours...?! At least coinbase said they will consider price in their decision as well.
With 2x having the majority of hasing power and core being ground to a halt and having huge fees who will be actually able to move their coins around and sell the 2x chain...?
95% of people are going to just be kicking back and acting like a cheerleader for the side they want to win and watching the price, yes we all expect the 2x chain to fail for lack of community support, but what we don't realize is the community has shifted wall street will soon be in the game now, and with the definition of the real BTC up for grabs where almost ALL NEW growth comes from the uneducated user who just want to speculate they won't care nor understand what is going on they just want to be with the winner. My point being that with Wall Street new money in the Trillions and the resources that the mining cartel has set up it isnt a strech to think short term loss = long (not even long 1-2 weeks at most?) huge gain.
Yes I get it most people if able who are true BTC people will say F this I'm selling my 2x for the real BTC but how many people will do that if the price is close at all or if they are able to even figure out how to. The market cap during the chaos will be 1-5% at best of the total liquidity out there with reinforcements unreliable able to get in to suppress the price with any certainty, and as noble as people sound they don't want to be on the losing side of their dollars so unless the battle ends quickly were in for something that could be far more sinister.
The market cap of 100B is so small compared to how much new money will be coming in through wall street CME (I'm a futures trader about 100 trillion or more is traded daily on these bigger markets) 1 decent sized fund could easily make up for BTC entire marker cap, and if they are in bed with this play anything could go.
I know I sound like conspiracy theorist here, but I'm just shedding some more light on the economical aspects that most people forget. 
What can you do? Well if your like me and can't spin up nodes or miners or add code do your best to wage war on the economic front. I don't trust exchanges but in this case the risk is worth it to me to support the cause, I have already been selling 2x futures in bulk to try to suppress the incentive and have plenty of more bullets ready and locked in if the evil powers try to bamboozle the markets with a temp pump of value and the hashrate to back it up.
I refuse to sit on the sidelines when so many people have worked so hard and done so much for the community and made me so much money by just believing I am ready to go down with the ship if thats what it takes.
If your like me lock and load on an exchange like Bitfinex and get ready for economical warfare since I can't assist in any other way this is what I shall do~

This I agree with the fact miners switch to the most profitable coin with the exception that some parties are long term motivated and may operate at a loss for the greater long term success. Perfect example would be Uber over Lyft, they operated at a loss for a long time to ensure dominance over the bigger market in the long term. I 100% independent miners will follow price, but we already have seen certain parties operate at a loss for a more grand plan than day by day profits.

Correct if it was only about block size limits but its about the team and the decentralized nature.
The tech doesnt drive the markets in this phase though however $$$$ will take it from here, and most people in this phase will be speculators, how many stock investors listen to conference calls? Any on this forum is like a expert compared to the next 1 trillion dollars that enters this space, so don't expect tech to matter, what matter is what the people with money decide to put money into
