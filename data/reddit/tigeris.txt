Jesus, every one of your questions has been outlined in the original PM you were sent.  has made it very clear that your ban is for posting almost the exact same message as your friend after he/she was banned for it.  You've effectively allowed to circumvent this ban by posting that content.  Therefore, to prevent more issues from you were banned.

Haha, you know - I've been telling people to do that ever since I first saw that rap ~5 years ago.  It totally makes sense to accept criticism so long as it's constructive.

As somebody who's new to Bitcoin, I really enjoyed this.  It highlights the real difficulties in living off Bitcoin, probes into big and little people working with the currency, shows some of the real charm of Bitcoin, and is a very accessible read.

What is the energy impact of Bitcoin when compared to other digital means (credit cards, bill pay through online banking)?  Extrapolating from this, is Bitcoin responsible in terms of energy?

Check the contex.  I have no issue with any of that.  I have an issue with saying a 'true bitcoiner' is in bitcoin for x.  With saying any real bitcoiner is currently washing their coins.  With saying a real bitcoiner is buying as many as they can.

This is a really good read.  Do you have any figures on the efficiency of bitcoin miners in converting electricity to heat?
I'm not sold on the idea that competition will necessarily take bitcoin mining to cold areas, but your answer has addressed a good diversity of issues.  Thank you!

I was hoping somebody more knowledgeable in the field than me would be able to comment.  Looking at your assertations concerning Figure 3, you are absolutely correct and their conclusions really shouldn't carry any substantial weight.
At this point I'm not sure what would be better, to have the thread deleted to stop people from getting the wrong idea, or leave it up so they can (hopefully) see your comment.

[I agree wholeheartedly](

It is very important, however, that this study was not performed with an attempt to control for any other factors.  From their conclusion:

Would you define gold as a currency or commodity?  I believe the end-goal of Bitcoin is to be a currency - one that's used by normal people everyday at that.

Then we need to encourage good practice as a community.  I'm pretty sure was advocating personal responsibility and customer service over simply grabbing the money and saying MINE!

Okay, if it's stupid - why?  Be constructive with your criticism.

Which is worse:  Feeling like an idiot because I didn't become rich or feeling like an idiot for throwing away money I could not afford to throw away and ending up on the street?
ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.  Consider all money burned when you invest.  Especially right now when the market is so volatile.

Holy oversimplification Batman!  Isn't this the exact kind of argument the OP is talking about?

I'm afraid I don't follow your logic...  Are you saying that by virtue of the fact that china uses it, it's corrupt?

How weirdly appropriate would it be if the Dread Pirate Roberts were to leave behind hidden treasure.

What defines a real bitcoiner?  How about a true Scotsman?  Do you believe your particular set of morals has to be present in another to make their perspective valid?

I really like Doans and Milos!
A couple of historic coins no longer in use include:
Dirham or Dinar - these two are some of the first to be made of gold and silver, allowing for scarcity like Bitcoin.
Dinarii  - although too long by my own criteria, is recognizable immediately as currency.
Drachma (or Drach) from ancient Greece.

According to [her story]( the owner was inspired by the journalist living off bitcoin for a week.

Assertions without evidence is not very worthwhile.  This is simply something you can point to easily if the topic comes up.
