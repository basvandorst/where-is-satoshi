The market is like a battlefield. The battlefield is riddled with mines, bunker encampments, craters created by artillery, barbed wires and trenches. As a commander, you can deduce that going through those areas where the shells have landed and where trenches and mines abound will mean certain death and defeat to you and your troops. Your best bet of action then is to stay away from those areas and flank the enemy. Enter in an area where it is less likely to be entrenched and guarded and you enter an area conducive for you to combat. Of course, the enemy could have relocated, of course the enemy could have decided to outmaneuver you and entrenched somewhere else where you are most likely to flank, cannons and tanks won't fire in the same spot obviously but you know the chances of not going into a death trap will give you a 90% chance to survive so the logical thing to do would be to avoid the area and flank instead. In the case that you are indeed wrong, then you adjust accordingly and prepare. 
Same thing with TA .Past price action won't totally reflect future ones but you will know for certain that the probability of it going up or down given the trends is high. If your "prediction" fails and price doesn't go according to the information given then you prepare for that as well and adjust accordingly and enter at a price and time that is conducive for you to profit. 
I hope this analogy will have served and helped even the smallets of brainlets understand what TA is all about. It's not a crystal ball, it's a series of informed calculations given a set of data to make decisions better.
