"Digital stocks. Digital equities. Digital fundraising for companies. Digital bonds. Digital contracts, digital keys, digital title, who owns what — digital title to your house, to your car. Like for example, you get a digital title on a car, attached to a digital key, where you own your car on the Bitcoin blockchain and on your smartphone. The key for opening your car and starting your car is tied to that title. And if I sell you my car, automatically you get title, and you get the key that lets you operate the car, and it's all digital, and it's all unique, and it can't be cracked. You've got digital voting, digital contracts, digital signatures. You've got unique pieces of digital content. If you guys wanted to know exactly who had every piece of content you ever made, you can track that. It's this long list. And then every aspect of financial services: insurance contracts, insurance derivatives, currency exchange, remittance — on and on and on. It gives you a chance to basically go after this very broad category of online business in a new way. And, by the way, if we had had this technology 20 years ago, we would've built it into the browser."

Blockchain wallet will let you import private keys. When you try to import a bip38 encrypted key it will ask you for the password.

Anyone with an IQ above retarded will read all of this information, realize that this is a GOX SPECIFIC PROBLEM and begin to learn about what Bitcoin is, the value a public ledger system can create, etc.
Front page of WSJ.com AND Google Finance now. This will raise awareness of thousands of people who either have no or very little idea of what Bitcoin is. It will be another touch point so they will begin to take it more seriously.
The news of an incompetent and insolvent exchange doesn't hurt Bitcoin in the long run, this is not a protocol problem.. it's like saying that faith in the US dollar was demolished because of Bernie Madoff - Or that gold holds no value because someone stole your wedding band..

I'll be writing a letter to chase explaining that I need to close my account because the risk of banking with them is too high.
This is getting ridiculous.

What is the theoretical top difficulty? Does 256 bit represent a feasible limit or is it essentially infinite?

You're right in many ways, but the mass adoption of the internet, email, cellphones etc. were able to be participated in without any type of monetary ownership, no one owns the concept of the internet. Knowledge was gained as a first mover, but that is it unless you invested in or created a company that grew with the internet.
Buying bitcoins now would have been like buying "stock" directly in the internet or email protocols in the early 90's, which wasn't possible. Imagine if there were only 21 million IP addresses that were given (or sold) to early users, and now had to be distributed among all users, or email addresses as another example. Obviously that would have been prohibitive, but you get the point. Then imagine you could share (to 8 decimals..) one of your limited IP addresses. How much would that be worth today at ~35% internet penetration globally?
It's an important nuance.

Quotes from smart people:
"There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance." -- Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft. 
"TV will never be a serious competitor for radio because people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn't time for it." -- author unknown, from The New York Times, 1939
"The wireless music box has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message sent to nobody in particular?" -- the heads of RCA respond to David Sarnoff's pitch for investment in radio
"Printed books will never be the equivalent of handwritten codices, especially since printed books are often deficient in spelling and appearance." -- the 15th-century monk Trithemius wrote In his treatise "In Praise of Copying"

Do your research.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:50:37
Here goes one:
Is there any disadvantage to importing a known private key, or easily crackable private key, into a wallet with other personal addresses that arent meant to be public. 
For example, say I have a web wallet with blockchain with 3-4 personal addresses, and I import the private key that corresponds with the hash of "password". What are the implications here? Do they change if it isnt a webwallet?

You guys are missing the point. Bitpay offers a great product and is already superior (in some ways) to credit card alternatives. If people REALLY want to give BFL ANOTHER chance..let them

This is probably one of the best threads on this sub so far - quality of response wise. People should read this.

I almost never actually post on reddit in general, just lurk. This is worth reading. Well said
