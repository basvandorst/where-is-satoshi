Cabin in Colorado for me
@_date: 2017-02-10 00:31:52
Because btc is a direct threat to them
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:33:30
You need both. Its not either/or
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:35:26
what are you talking about? Segwit doesnt even allow more than the current transaction throughput, all that space is for witness data
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:33:53
I like this alot
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:15:29
nothing, thats the whole point, they want bigger blocks and core is refusing for "reasons"
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:28:21
You are correct and its concerning to me that nobody here is willing to answer this truthfully.
Using Blockstream/Lightning is basically the same thing as Paypal.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:32:56
Honestly, a 2mb + Segwit would have worked for the extreme majority
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:30:10
This reads exactly like the old woman who writes letters to the city council because of her neighbors hedge
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:22:17
Wow. You might just be retarded


@_date: 2017-08-13 02:16:59
Are you trying to get them kidnapped?
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:54:46
wouldnt happen that fast, would it? 
they would need time to sell, cash out fiat, wait for wire deposits, buy the gear, set it up and then start mining
Unless they thought 800 was the peak?
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:38:48
If the line goes one inch along in the x axis, the following spike is 2-3 inches high in the y axis. Its very technical stuff, dont feel bad
@_date: 2017-01-06 02:02:19
Have you ever seen the chappelle video where they give all the black people reparations? Thats gonna be me. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:10:51


What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:52:10
Maybe its time to have a conversation about Change Wallets/Addresses
I think a main contributor to the mempool/fee debacle might be the (well intended) practice of using change addresses.
If this guy has been using bitcoin a lot lately and every tx had a change output, hes gonna have a bad time. Lets say you both send and receive one tx a day, if you want to sweep your wallet after a month it could be 60 addresses. That is how you end up with $60 fees for $400 transactions

I thought USD was divisible by 9 decimals... Isnt it better than BTC that way?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:47:06
well la dee dah
some of us make 1k every $100 
@_date: 2017-01-06 01:03:32
Two or three times higher than the width of the last *two years*
Oh, this graph is also logarithmic, that means the space from 0-100 is more visible than 500-700. All of our shit is about to get retarded. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:05:35
r/btc agrees
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:51:18
not really a theory at this point, capital flight from the mainland is extremely well documented
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:58:14
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:58:02
the problem with this kind of math is that once it hits $1500 *many* people will be transferring at lease some of their holdings to cash out. I have an exit point as does everyone else.

Alternatively, they will earn exactly what they deserve, just like miners.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:18
Are you retarded?
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:51:51
What makes me angry is we are the only people willing to stand up to shit countries like russia and china and we still get flak for it. If we werent the backbone of the UN and NATO, you would all be gobbled up in weeks. 
Are there bad actors in the US military industrial complex? absolutely. does that mean we should let wannabe emperors steamroll the world? fuck you if you think yes.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:58:48
For starters, Canada barely spends any money on the military because of the US. Then they have the gall to criticize our military spending as well as lack of social programs. Fuck Canada.
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:28:24
You know what? you are completely right. We arent next to russia, so I guess everything i said is incorrect. 
All hail Turkey, All hail Erdogan, right?
@_date: 2019-12-24 18:27:52
I am literally advocating the opposite of isolationism and nationalism. what are you bleating about?

According to this chart, If we spike up and hit 20k today, everything would be ok?
