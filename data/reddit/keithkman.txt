The USA has universal healthcare; it's called the VA. And it's a complete disaster.

Just got $10 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase because someone signed up with my referral link. Thing is, I’ve never given out my referral link. How did that happen?

Andreas should be thanking, really, one person who gave the two large donations.  is their twitter. 
Please note, after this person made the large donations someone signed up with the same name on reddit and acted like they were the same person. People started donating to the address they posted on Reddit since this person said any  money put into the wallet address they linked would go to charitable causes. This was a hoax account and I'm assuming that person made some money.
The person who donated to Andreas real reddit username is @_date: 2017-12-26 09:25:48
You honestly believe the US Federal Government wasn’t going to get their slice of the pie regardless of who’s in office? 
Look at what Democrat Chuck Schumer did to crypto in NY.

Yes, I had to submit a pic of the front and back of my driver’s license and a selfie so they could confirm my identity.

Your point? That’s like saying the Dodgers won the World Series because they scored more runs overall. Everyone knows the electoral college determines the winner not the popular vote and both parties were striving for 270, not the popular vote. The founding fathers specifically set this up to prevent voter fraud and so large cities like LA and NYC would not determine the winner. Worked exactly like it was designed.

We have “net neutrality” laws. They are called the Clayton Antitrust Law and Sherman Antitrust Law. “Net neutrality” doesn’t have a legal definition, just a nice name on a bill that gets the public behind the bill without actually reading the bill. 
Here is good video on the matter, long though.

Make sure you are selecting the exchange you bought on when using Delta. Have you tried force quitting the app and re-opening it to see if it fixes the issue?

Hal Finney will go down as one of the people that changed the course of world history for the better right along side Satoshi and the rest of the Cyberpunk crew. What a remarkable way to end his post.
I encourage you guys and gals to watch the documentary on Netflix called “Banking with Bitcoin” this holiday season if you haven’t seen it already. Get family members to watch it with you. These guys back in 2008-2009 we’re so far ahead of their time it’s pretty surreal. 
Cheers to Hal. Godspeed.

I know, Hillary is awful. Not even a Merry Christmas tweet this year. We really dodged a bullet. Thank god.

Remember when China didn’t even bring out the stairs for Air Force One when Obama came to town because they hated him so much forcing Obama to exit the ass of AF1? Now compare that to the grand welcoming President Trump got when he visited China this year. Yea, his reputation on the world stage is in the shitter. /s
Not even comparable.

You never answered my question, rather instead resulted to attacking me personally. That's what people do when they don't have a valid argument. That's fine; I wish you all the best in the future of crypto and hope you find your moon.

Damn, what a nice visual! ��
Actually, this topic of swapping alts for alts as a taxable event has been a gray area for awhile. A lot of tax people recommended to report swaps to protect oneself from the IRS. One of those people made this helpful site.

Don’t hold your breath. The investigation has been compromised from the beginning. The leak this week showing the top investigators 10,000 text messages bashing the President won’t sit well with the DOJ. :)

Coinbase owns GDAX.com. Deposit money into your Coinbase USD wallet and transfer that money over to GDAX and buy on there. Fees are a lot less or free (depending on how you buy). You can transfer coins, money, etc back to Coinbase. Your Coinbase username and password works on GDAX.

How much are you saving (I assume you work)?

Everyone’s thoughts on Bounty0x? Classic pump and dump or a good idea especially after the Etherdelta hacker fiasco? White paper looks interesting as does the concept to me. 
I’m not shilling, genuinely curious.

The question I ask people that were for this bill to not be repealed (never mind the name had hardly anything to do with the actual bill) - if they are truly for an open and free internet, do they support the big tech companies pushing this NN bill who have “Trust and Safety” teams to censor and ban users these tech companies disagree with? If so, why can’t ISPs have “Trust and Safety” teams to censor content on their networks? Doesn’t work both ways. 
It’s really laughable to watch these large tech companies shill for this bill only to ban users on their platforms they disagree with. It’s truly bizarre. Watching the Reddit CEO edit Pro-Trump posts, Reddit making it so Pro-Trump subreddits don’t show up on r/all, Reddit making Pro-Trump subreddits have their own rules that apply no where else on Reddit, Reddit flagging users behind the scenes that post on Pro-Trump subreddits...and then shill for “net neutrality”? That is NOT a free, neutral, open internet.  And I’ll say it again, Reddit is no longer “the front page of the internet” as long as they continue to censor in the name of “trust and safety”.

What exactly did I post that was “fake news”? The link to see how much you’ll be saving under the new tax plan? Asking you if you saw what Chuck Schumer did to crypto regulations in NY and Wall Street? 
Every time you bought coins with a different coin (alt for alt), that was a taxable event, even before the new tax plan. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:12:31
Are you kidding? Reddit mods and admins don’t allow anything Pro-Trump. Pro-Trump subreddits aren’t allowed on all and have their own rules that don’t apply anywhere else on Reddit. Hell the CEO was caught editing users that were Pro-Trump.  
If you think Reddit represents the general US population, let me take you back to Nov 8th. The astroturfing is real on Reddit, believe me. Reddit is anything BUT a place on the internet that values a free and open internet. They love to censor. It is definitely NOT “the front page of the internet”.

Nice dig! /s I actually post all over Reddit, feel free to creep. Looks like you already did. ;)
Let me guess, you’re for “net neutrality” for ISPs but not for the large tech companies that actively censor content (google, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, etc)? When the big tech companies like Reddit censor certain subreddits from the front page, have separate rules for certain subreddits, and the CEO was caught editing comments critical of him - you’re ok with that and at the same time will shout about “muh net neutrality”? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:47:33
So what exactly has changed? Links please. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:07:26
So the new tax bill closes a loophole that applies not to just crypto, but most property transactions? Seems reasonable to me. I’m all for closing loopholes.
A lot of people, myself included, have been treating swapping alts for alts as taxable events. For us, nothing will change. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:59:59
This is called fake news. It’s been around awhile. Got really bad about a couple years ago around the time Trump announced his run for President. Since then, fake news has spread far and wide to all aspects of media. 
Remember when the WSJ wrote the hit piece on the number 1 youtuber, PewDiePie, a totally fake story and then the three writers of the hit piece went to his house and knocked on his door for comment? The WSJ did this. Incredible.
