Bitcoin is not an investment, it's gambling. You definitely should not put all your money in it.

Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.

Does not make sense. At cex.io you have a chance to buy GHs, mine and then sell it to some sucker while they are still overpriced.
At bit-mining.co you are guaranteed to lose. You pay 0.04 btc per GH and will only get 0.02-0.03 btc in return.

Nothing to do with the law. They were processing 0-5 transactions per day, so the business was long dead.

I don't see this option. Was it removed?
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:23:37
Well, the fees are low now (except for small transactions), but it only works because of block rewards. Each transaction [costs $15]( (and it is a small number compared to $90 this January).
If we remove block rewards as it is planned, transaction fee will [become unsastainable](

Have a look at a dictionary. Your communism definition is a bit wrong.

No, they don't. There are a lot of services in Ghana to top up your account without bank account or a credit card. I.e.

Assuming they pay 4% for cc processing, which they do not. 
What if they pay 1%? It still makes sense yet, as coinbase is charging 0% up to $1,000,000.
Does it make sense in the long run? Not so obvious.

Even one confirmation takes 10 minutes. It is not a realistic scenario for most shops.

Please forward all your next offers to me. Sure you get many.

And than they wait for an hour until they have 6 confirmations.

5) Should not be shunned by government
In Russia there is no BTC ban. The Central Bank just said that it is likely to be used for money laundering (true) and businesses using it will probably get inspected more thoroughly.
The result? No serious business takes bitcoin even though some of them (Wheely, Ulmart) did before. So much for bitcoin without borders and states.

With transaction fees as high as 7 cents for BTC, Dogecoin is more likely to succeed as a tipping currency.

It is actually very easy. There are even papers proving that if you have a large enough capital (&gt;$1 mil), you don't even have to choose where you invest wisely. All you need is a little bit of diversity and your money will grow.
On the other hand, if you live paycheck to paycheck...

Great! Bitcoin solved the problem that was already solved by PerfectMoney, Skrill &amp; Payza, but in much more complicated and expensive way.
Here come the angry downvotes.

According to this plot, BTC price is around $500 now.

Well, I sold my GHS at cex.io. Not much more I can do.
How is the p2p mining thing going?
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:49:22
Well, bitcoin transactions are not free either. You pay $0.08 + whatever coinbase charges.
Also, here is an article claiming much lower fees do exist:

What is even more fascinating, USSR has **never** declared it had communism. It was always socialism.

You need to buy bitcoins before spending. It will balance out.

I would not know for sure whether it is r/Buttcoin if it was not for different header style.

I'm Charlie Lee, long time Bitcoin advocate and investor.
Today I'm at the Bank of China headquarters in Beijing China.
I had a nice chat with trusted source, about their current situation.
He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers...
