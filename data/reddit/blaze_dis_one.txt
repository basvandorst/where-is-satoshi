So sorry for your loss. I buried my father in law today. Life goes on and there is no point beating yourself up over 'what ifs'. Stay strong, you seem like a smart person and you can have a great life ahead of you despite this. Best wishes.

You can mention how smart contract enabling blockchains like Ethereum are will revolutionize industries like healthcare and insurance to enable massive cost cutting and improved efficiency plus more security in terms of patient confidentiality etc

500x leverage lol... good luck not being stopped out on that

And you can essentially do that with gold as well Peter
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:09:14
I like some of the points you hear him make about the US debt mountain etc but gold has almost halved in value in the last few years and he's never been anything other than 100% bullish on it.

Someone in this subreddit said it was possible to hack it not long ago because he had done it (although he didn't go into details), if that's the case then that would be a pretty good reason not to activate it.

You're just pulling numbers out of your ass.

Except, it didn't really happen, they didn't ban it outright, just stopped banks from offering Bitcoin related products. And its mostly Chinese demand that has pushed it back up.
@_date: 2018-10-13 10:03:18
That was great, thanks :-) 
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:32:08
Btw if you think it isn't China then just look at the Huobi volume
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:53:35
which is peanuts

They didn't ban it, just restricted it. I'm saying if they ACTUALLY banned the exchanges from operating, and the miners, as part of their clampdown on capital flight.

I live in China and its 11.30pm on Friday night...

If you did hack segwit then please be more vocal about this, we all care about bitcoin's future here and the community must be made aware of something this serious. Thanks.

the fancy stuff thing?

This is great and a much more realistic metric to use when comparing the size of Bitcoin to other assets eg stocks.
@_date: 2019-08-26 16:49:29
ETC, BNB and Tether only? When corn?

They would also have to outlaw credit cards and the banking system by that logic as they use more power than Bitcoin. Luckily as power generation becomes more sustainable (33% renewable on the UK already for instance)  it's less of a problem anyway.

Insurance companies will use it to make payouts more efficient, eg: your hotel is flooded and you loose business as a result; a  running smart contract can see the exact drop in revenues and reimburse you accurately.

I think a lot of the downvoters are probably just jealous people who have yet to do anything with their lives and think anyone who has must be lying about it.

A friend bought GBTC and he's down 30% on the position even tho the BTC price is now higher. Not sure how anyone feels comfortable buying this thing when it has such a disconnect from the real price.
I'll take real BTC over that and keep it on my Ledger any day thanks.
