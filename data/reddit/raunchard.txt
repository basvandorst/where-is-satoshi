That is not what this discussion is about. It is about the dirty marketing methods BCH is using.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:15:27
No Issues that haven't been solved by Litecoin years ago. BCash has better marketing though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:51:51
No surprise since Roger Ver is a mod in this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:48:17


No, it was mostly because a lot of big names Bankers were publicly speaking pro Bitcoin, and started seeing its potential. Hence a lot of regular people that don't even know what a fork is, jumped in.
Downvoting is just as effective, if not more so, than removing a comment or criticism outright, with the Karma system of Reddit. Especially since it seems orchestrated.

Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:37:46
Checked your history, you sir are a Bitcoin Cash shiller.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:16:09
Yeah, growing 100s% in a couple days is completely normal, no need to worry. Just make sure to sell at the top of this peak back into REAL Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:51:49
Do you know what OperationDragonslayer is? They want to DESTROY bitcoin and take its place. Read r/btc for once and see for your self.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:42:36
Shiller might be the wrong word. But you and most of the BTC group want to see the original Bitcoin fail, and let Bitcoin Cash take its place. You can not deny that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:41:58
It is not about being competition free, it is about the shady marketing methods the BCH team is working with, by pretending to be pro Bitcoin, when in fact they are not. No doubt they have also no scruple to manipulate the current growth rate of BCH and dump Bitcoin since there was no big news that would cause this disruption.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:38:35
Then what about the logo that changes to the Bitcoin Cash logo?
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:30:53
Not fuding, just trying to warn people of the btc reddit group.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:00:46
Yep, that was why it was canceled, because of the tremendous support of the community. And yes, those people wanted to see the original Bitcoin fail and let B2X take its place.
Bitcoin failing or crashing now would mean a setback for the entire crypto market for years, and giving credibility to all those Bankers that said Bitcoin is a Scam or a Bubble. But you don't care about that.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:43:07
Yes, also Roger Ver was once pro Bitcoin. Things changed.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:10:42
So you don't find it funny that one of the biggest BCH supporters, Roger Ver, is a mod at this sub?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:17:42
Stabilized? It is jumping 20%s in a couple of hours up and down.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:58:51
yep, this is just as effective as banning people right away.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:31:45
Keep on dreaming. Hope you didn't invest too much in BCC, the bubble is about to burst, once Roger Ver and his lackeys run out of Bitcoin they can manipulate the market with.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:09:07
I am mostly active in the Cardano Project. But I was just so flustered today because of all the Bitcoin Cash propaganda comments in the BTC Reddit group, telling people that soon a Flipening would happen. Same on Twitter, big names saying the same. I just feel like these people don't understand what damage that would bring to the entire market and the trust people have in it. Not your fault though, keep doing what you believe in.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:41:55
That is what they like to tell people. But why then is the biggest BCH advocate, Roger Ver, a moderator in this group? And what about the changing logo?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:16:59
Good for you. Just make sure to sell back into Real Bitcoin at peak. They can't keep this up forever.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:42:56
Roger Ver amongst others. And he is also a mod of this supposedly Bitcoin reddit sub that has acutally become a BCH sub.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:24:04
btc reddit is a false flag group that acutally is Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:35:33
Easier said than done
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:43:53
Well, excuse me for getting worked up about all this, no reason to insult me. "Great minds don't call other people small minds" - me
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:28:21
and again, this post gets downvoted by the same people. No answer to that ha?
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:38:20
Did indeed, then I guess this case can be closed, and they are officially a Bitcoin Cash sub.
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:01:48
Yep, had to delete a post a recently made there.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:51:12
Yes, keep spreading your FUD, like you do with Bitcoin. Until you succeed in your impossible endeavor to overtrump Bitcoin you could at least have the decency and change the group name. And the logo.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:24:52
Yeah, it is really impressive how far you can go if you have no shame whatsoever. "Bitcoin Judas" disgusts me to the core!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:17:13
First Post, and it is spreading FUD. What a surprise, the dirty tactics of the BCH team disgust me.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:24:01
If you contact the Mods, you can get it approved.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:54:01
You don't need to draw lines. Just hover over the icon and it becomes the Bitcoin Cash logo. I don't think that is a coincidence when you have a look at the content of the group.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:20:42


Haha, had a good laugh at that. But then again he is called the "Bitcoin Jesus".
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:51:18
Learn to speak properly before you call other people dumb.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:45:10
Then why not create a new crypto, and not try to overthrow Bitcoin, which a) leads to many people losing money and b) destroys the trust that mainstream media and regular people have for crypto currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:40:12
Certainly learned a valuable lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:38:39
Then what about the logo that changes to the Bitcoin Cash logo?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:14:31
Bitcoin gets a lot of attention in public media, big bankers recently spoke positively about Bitcoin and its future. That is why a lot of regular people, that do not even know about other coins bought in.
The BCH growth rate is mostly artificial, there was nothing noteworthy that would cause such a big growth.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:55:57
Are you also See how stupid that question is? I keep track of the posts I make, also if they are not replied to me directly.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:34
Unscrupelous is to pretend something that you are not. Imagine a Burger King fan group, where suddenly everyone started talking about how awesome Mc Donalds is and tells everyone to sell their Burger King Stocks for Mc Donalds Stocks. And it turns out the Mc Donalds CEO is a mod of this Burger King group. If you find this to be decent, then I think we can stop this conversation. In fact, this is even illegal, at least in my country.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:47:05
I am talking about false-flag marketing. No doubt Bitcoin Cash has its merits, although I can not see why it would be better than Litecoin for example.
