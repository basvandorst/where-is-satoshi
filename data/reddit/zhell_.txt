Can you please link to the btc transaction you used to open this LN channel ?

If 0conf isn't safe you could hack satoshidice.com and make a fortune. They allow betting with 0conf

So this is it ? We should recommend people use CC rather than Bitcoin now? Satoshi would be proud /s

You can still use your bitcoin to buy many things from Amazon. Not exactly anonymous since you provide an address but you can be smart.

Haha kind of true. But you can use the money to finance alternatives to existing marketplaces that will make it possible to spend it for what you want to buy. But yes it is hard work.

Thanks for posting this. These words got me subscribed as I was reading them for the very first time. 
"P2P e-cash"
"purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash" 
"payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through afinancial institution."

a fork is not inflation. The total market cap of the original chain at the block b-1 fork was the same as the total market cap of the Core+Cash chains at the block b+1 after the fork. So you create more units of currency but they still have the same value as a whole. And since everyone gets the same amount there is no inflation. Fiat inflation rewards those who get the newly created money first because the prices are still lower since no one has seen this new money in the marketplace so no one has adjusted its prices yet, this occurs because only a few get the new money at the expense of all others. Since everyone got BCH matching their BTC holdings, it was perfectly distributed and no inflation occured. That's why the combined market cap was still the same a few seconds after the fork, then each chain and each price is free to go its own way

Maybe I cannot write an objective article but do you think not giving me facts that I ask for, by going against my own bias, will help?
R/btc would not help since they are pro-BCH, I want to hear what you guys have to say. 
This is about finding facts to share with my public, maybe you consider that trolling, I don't.

I have my own opinion on many subject but when writing an article I want to be objective and provide proofs and sources.
Everyone has biases but that should not prevent us from making rational and sourced works, that's the point of journalism.
So I will explain in my work what happened here for all to see and link to this thread. I will also give the information you provide me if you have any answer to allow readers to make their own opinion with as much fact as possible.

I know that but I want to find pro-BTC businesses that were against the fork. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:14:35
It is the first historical fork of bitcoin. So you are saying that the history of bitcoin doesn't belong to r/bitcoin, weird.

What is my agenda? I am really doing a research project that will end up in an article and a video and for now I haven't got any answer. Should I conclude that 0 business in the bitcoin ecosystem was vocally against the Bcash fork? I just want to get informed without bias.
