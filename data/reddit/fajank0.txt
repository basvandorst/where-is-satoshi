Because I'm into cryptos but I can't stand HODL people because they are the idiots who were too dumb to cash in on the last wave. I'm like bitcoin for different reasons, I'm not just here for the next moon.

It's as much as in a bear market as the bitcoin is right now. Both have no proof that they're going to go back up in the future.

Now do the same with cost of a cup of coffee with bitcoin but at the end of 2017

I can't blame you for coping this hard but you're not getting your money back. You had one shot at this and you fucked up.

I'm not kidding they get deployed for the most petty fucking shit sometimes, but whatever. If you're subscribed to the Austria-Hungary times-esque idea of not paying your taxes, you should at least do your part by supporting your favorite newspapers etc.

Petike nem tudta, hogy a TEK is olvassa a reddit-et, és emiatt Petike a börtönből többet nem olvasott redditet.

I HIGHLY doubt it'll ever reach the last moon's strenght but I do have some investments in bitcoin because it's bound to go up by a bit.

Cuz half of this sub bought in because of a friend at 16k to "cash out" at 50k.

We live in a society
Now let's all google "What is bitcoin" to create artificial deflation (shoutout to RulerZod)! I'm glad my currency is not governed by fucking bureaucrats but rather redditors abusing bots. What a stable economy!

Yeah man muh freedom over everything. We live in a society.
