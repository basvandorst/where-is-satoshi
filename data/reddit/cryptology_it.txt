I fully agree. As much as this situation sucks people should react rationally and not emotionally.

You really need to think harder at Coinbase guys. How can you call yourself "GLOBAL Digital Asset Exchange" when you don't accept accounts from half of the world and you restrict so much trading in the few assets that you list. I live in the EU and I can open USD denominated accounts worldwide to trade stocks, bonds, derivatives, whatever but I cannot trade USD pairs at GDAX. I'm really disappointed about this decision.

Great post. Looking to keep on trading at Bitfinex. I'm concerned about lawsuits and the exchange being forced into liquidation though.

Is there any evidence that clients personal data was also compromised?

Compliments on the great job you're doing keeping people informed and holding everyone hand right now. I'm pretty sure Bitifinex will not end up as MGox.

How many here would have said that Bitcoin would reach $20k when it was &lt;= $1? We are in a very bearish mindset right.

they got what they were looking for.

They said somewhere they wouldn't do that but who knows... Fact is they started repaying some of the debt. As small step but certainly in the right direction.
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:23:45
That's correct. They converted BFX to USD 1:1

Why don't you start by posting some proof of your claim?
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:48:56
Yes. Except for all the unconfirmed transactions that were dropped by nodes after waiting to be included in a block for 72hs. Great. All good indeed.

No. I cannot predict the future but I can see patterns in data.

The end of the rally is near... (again).

Time to take a new look at the chart -&gt; 
Blocks are for all practical purposes full, miners fees are soaring and Bitcoin is becoming a 'probabilistic' payment system where you are never certain if and when a payment will be confirmed. All we can do now is bid up the fee and hope for the best.
