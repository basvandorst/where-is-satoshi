I was going to continue to argue until I read your last paragraph. Thank you for your explanation!

Why does development on Bitcoin appear to be so slow from an outside perspective? Is it because the compensation of developers isn't as straightforward as a normal company? Or is it just so much more complex than other cryptos who seem to pump out major updates much more quickly?

I appreciate that altcoins definitely over exaggerate progress, but some of them have made fantastic progress in the past year versus (from an admittedly uninformed POV) Bitcoin, which to my knowledge has only done Segwit which isn't near fully adopted and we've had the whole BCH/BTC fiasco. From what I read, as well, the lightning network (years in development) isn't exactly setting the world alight either.
I'm not trying to bash Bitcoin by the way, and I am far from an expert, so I could be off in my criticism.
Surely the delay in development is a massive hindrance to progress, though? Is this the only way, given the collaboration requirements versus a more autocratic limited company that can just overrule everyone and say "we're going with X, put all your efforts into that"?
The speed of development is a real concern.

Yep. Bitcoin is my hedge, and chainlink is my moonshot.
