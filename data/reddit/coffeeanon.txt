what happened with this exchange?

You can still move you coinbase amount to GDAX first to move it to another exchange for free. As of a couple weeks ago GDAX was still covering transaction fees for BTC withdrawls. You just have to set up another account on an exchange and get the address there to send them to. From there you can do whatever you want with them. If you're planning on holding though I would send them to a wallet you own

My rule on Craigslist is that if it seems too good to be true it probably is. I would take the advice of the majority in this thread and create a clean address to give the scammer and take it as far as you can until there is risk for you. Then report back so that the rest of the bitcoin community knows what to watch out for and how this scam might work.

HODL it where it is until you need it

It's the same advice from the main post

If nothing else, this has to fall under disruptive practices right?

I'm hoping people will take this post seriously and start emailing their exchanges and wallet developers. Let's make some noise.
