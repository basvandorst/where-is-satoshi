Wow, it must be REALLY secure!

Coinbase said "we don't currently support GoBank."

How much of the hashing is gibberish/busywork?

On Android devices, there is "QR Droid" which is a camera app that only detects QR codes.  It vibrates and with one tap copies QR codes to the clipboard.

Fuck Coinbase.

That's for that useful information, you brainless shithead.

bitminter's Java.

At the point of sale from the exchange.  By wallet, I mean any wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:08:50
Definitely get the Amazon Basic hubs if you use the ASICs without their own power source.  And I HIGHLY recommend bitminter.com.  Check it out.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:37:54
Everyone's getting these for Christmas.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:40:43
Was that everything for you?
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:43:13
It's 20 ASICminers on three Amazon Basic hubs.  Should net one coin every four months.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:53:25
At 6.7 GH/s, it should produce one Bitcoin well inside five months.  Bitcoin is almost at $400.

I just got a 57% refund :/

Bitcoin was $200 when I ordered at the beginning of the month.  Looks like the price doubled with Bitcoin.  Look into the BFL Jalapeno.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:28:29
I guess the real question is: Do I even NEED a wallet?  I suppose the answer is yes?
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:31:20
Indeed.  Retail price: $89. Would have had to buy three of them.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:32:50
Is it absolutely necessary to have a wallet at the point of transaction and beyond?  I don't understand why (assuming the Bitcoin simply goes into a wallet before being lost in the distant future).
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:25:22
Please be careful with your private keys and password security.  Enable two-factor on all the accounts you can and encrypt all sensitive files.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:45:57
Thank you for your thoughtful advice.  Indeed, I think I'll keep it.  But I may list it with an unrealistically high reserve.
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:32:02

They seem pretty obsessed with security.  They have optional 2-factor security.
@_date: 2013-10-26 18:49:26
This was quite helpful.  Thank you.  I've bought Bitcoin before, but I've always sent them to an internet wallet.  I'm guessing that after I buy them but before they're deposited into my wallet, they're either in limbo or in a sort of transaction wallet?  I pay, get a private key, then put that in my wallet.  Without my own wallet, what would happen to the transaction and that key?  THAT is what I wanted to transfer.  It seems everyone is saying that's not possible, but they're saying it indirectly.

I had Google Authenticator two-factor enabled on inputs.io, but the exploit was server-side.  The server itself lost all the Bitcoin.

btcquick.com, inputs.io  I'm a first-time buyer this week and these were perfect.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:45:44
It's not expensive enough, I guess.  Someone else today was looking into a $10,000 unit.  Also, admittedly, it's not very clear.  But anyone who recognizes bitminter and the USB ASICminers can see everything.
