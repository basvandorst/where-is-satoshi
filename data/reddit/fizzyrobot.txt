Yep things were messed up for a while.
I paid 65 sat/byte (worked out to be about $3-4) on December 20th and it took a a week and a half to get my transaction through.  I knew that going into it and I was totally cool with it as it was a low priority transfer.
But now if you look at the current fees: 
It looks like the same fee would get the job done in a day.
The strange thing is if I'm reading that chart correctly there are still a LOT of transactions paying the maximum fee (631+ satoshis/byte).  And then a reasonable curve of transaction fees going through the rest.

I did on blockchain.info and it is there but it doesn't show a position in the queue.

Hey that was pretty informative, thanks!

Thanks I can see that things are getting a bit quieter.

So obviously this is an advertisement for Shakepay, but I figured I'd try it out.
I signed up this morning, send them some money and I bought half Ether and half Bitcoin with it.  Their exchange must not be very busy because the displayed exchange rate is less than what is going on at QuadrigaCX right now.
Immediately after buying I transferred to my Ether/BTC wallets and it looks like all is well.
The interface is mobile only right now, and it is a bit clunky.  For example I had to enter in the value of what I wanted to send manually, it would have been helpful if I had an option to automatically fill the field with the maximum value.
I don't know what it will look like going the other way, selling crypto for CAD and sending it back.
Anyway nice job, looks okay and definitely faster than QuadrigaCX.

They no longer support RBC (or RBC doesn't support them) for Interac Online with the 1.5% fee.
They might still accept e-transfer though.
Edit: I just tried one and I remember why I don't like e-transfer at QuadrigaCX.  They charge 2% on each one (that's $65 for a $3k transfer - which is also the maximum) and you have to wait for them to send you an email with instructions.
So I'm going to give shakepay a shot.  I don't know what their volume is like or how they work but a bunch of people here seem to like them.

Goddam.  I've got 3 BTC saved for each of my kids...
I'm not all-in.

We all bought that pizza. Every one of us who didn't buy or otherwise acquire btc back then, we missed the chance for absurd wealth. And we missed it together.

You could have bought only at ATH for the last years and still been way up.
But DCA is better, make more smaller buys to smooth out the insanity.

I think he's arguing that solving the zero confirmation coffee purchase probably isn't worth doing because it is easily solvable in human ways. 
It doesn't mean that it isn't a problem, it just means that the coffee shop purchase scenario isn't a good example.

I've done something like this for my kids. 
Each has a paper wallet with 3 BTC each, sealed up in a PVC pipe. I laminated the paper, and also vacuum sealed a USB stick with the keys stored in various formats (png/jpeg/gif) and the key as a text file as well. I also 3D printed a QR code and vacuum sealed that too. 
They're buried out there now. Hopefully theft and house fire proof. I did this a couple years ago, I'm planning to dig them up every 5 years or so to check on them and replace the USB sticks.

I just bought 0.07 today to add to my stash.  Dollar cost averaging, it works baby.
I buy a little bit every month, and while I try to roughly time it to correspond to a dip I don't try too hard.  Otherwise you end up waiting for the dip that never happens.

That's a damn good idea. I'm going to do that too.
