I'm sure would welcome any help.  Best way to start is by joining the Slack channel (see cypherpoker.org)

I find it really interesting to think about 'speculating' in Bitcoin collectables.  It's difficult to imagine the BTC value of these objects keeping pace with Bitcoin itself, should bitcoin go fully mainstream.
Ironically, these probably have the most value as a 'hedge' against bitcoin failure, since crypto will almost certainly succeed in one form or another, and these have an important place in its history.  In that sense, they're priceless.

It's a form of protest, really.  The longer the ban list grows, the more credibility they lose.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:12:01
What are the reasons?
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:50:54
Yes, agreed re: The Times.  I'm not sure about the Cassascius coins...they seem to derive most of their value from the nostalgia / huge BTC holdings of the early adopter community...not sure how much wider appeal they have should BTC go mainstream.

Other than the BTC part, I think it looks identical to many, many people's portfolios...and therein lies the problem.

I would be very surprised if one of Coinbase or Gemini don't announce OtherCoin trading on the 14th.  The stakes are pretty high in the race to become the dominant exchange, and you have to believe they've taken notice of all this volume.

The idea of pricing stock indices in BTC seems a little strange.  Bitcoin moves more in a day than these indexes will move in a year.  Relative to BTC, this will be like holding a portfolio of cash.
I must be missing something.  If the main benefit is to invest in small increments, surely there are better schemes for investing small amounts of fiat money into fiat-economy companies and indices?

What are the advantages of Rootstock, vs. setting up a peg like BTC Relay and just using Ethereum?
Edit: Down-voted?  I'm not trolling.  Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:33:02
Both :)
Edit:  Seriously.  If you believe in ETH, look at how those two shapes have smoothed out portfolio volatility.

Understanding regulatory capture.  IMO, this is key to understanding why a decentralized monetary system is our best option.

It's not that they're trying to hide the money that's been printed...it's that things are so broken, the printing didn't work.  Negative interest rates are an attempt to stave off 'deflation'.
Regardless, it shouldn't be up to a handful of individuals to set the variables that control the global economy...and negative interest rates are going to have some bizzarro consequences, including paying interest on account balances and earning interest on debt.

[BTC relay]( is just one example of how Bitcoin and Ethereum can benefit each other.

Not saying it's even remotely likely, but this situation *could* arise in a cashless economy.  If there's no place to park $100 where the 'savings' rate is less than -2%, there would be an incentive to pay back the loan...and lending out money at -1% would be advantageous.

Woah, this is part of the 'leaders' section from the Oct 31st print edition.  It will be featured on the cover (in small white letters) and there's a chance 'The Trust Machine' will be the cover illustration.

Central banks lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.  There's actually nothing special about negative interest rates...they're just lower than the current interest rates which happen to be ~0%.
Listen to some 'Planet Money' podcasts about 'The Fed' to understand more.

Thanks for reading.  Happy to answer any questions about margin lending / our lending bot service in this thread!  -Ben
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:29:13
Good catch, I will fix it now.  has an open source [bot]( that you can host locally.  
The goal of the PLB project is to offer a service for the less technically savvy.  There is of course inherent risk in keeping your funds on an exchange, but properly configuring your Poloniex API keys as per our instructions will give the bot permissions to lend your funds, not trade or withdraw them.

I run a [service]( that automates lending on Poloniex.  Similar to lending on Bitfinex but the rates are slightly higher (posted on the homepage).  The mechanics are described [here](  It's definitely not risk free, but so far the risk / reward has been very good.  Feel free to DM or reply to this comment with any additional questions.
