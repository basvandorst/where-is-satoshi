friend close to them on the investor side says they were supposed (told investors) to build something to replace paywalls with micropayments after the tipping bots (similar to Brave i guess?). instead they wanted to become their own reddit (???) and apparently (obviously) failed.

the success of bitcoin is premised on its adoption. in effect, this is the ecosystem turning away demand.

part of the initial hype was that they were to be the first major US bitcoin exchange. coinbase beat them to that punch almost tragically, then itbit's resurgence kicked them in the head.

Not mutually exclusive. In fact, "big market share" means the benefits of decentralization and censorship resistance are more secure.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:27:54
yes, but we wont have the benefits of global distributed ledger that's censorship resistant if private blockchains become predominant instead, which should be alarming. although good for adoption in the short-medium term, allowing banks, etc. to get their feet wet, this is bad in the long term. 
the fact that effectively nothing is being done about this turning away of demand as the demand is increasing at a rate greater than ever is even more alarming, challenging everything we've built so far. 
i wouldn't care about private/alternative blockchains if it were simply people adopting them out of stupidity or denial rather than, in this case, bitcoin effectively refusing to accommodate something it was initially designed to accommodate (read: block size was intended to increase at a later date).

Almost every new Bitcoin user I've met so far has had this as one of their very first questions about the system: "But why don't governments just shut the whole Bitcoin system down if it's so useful to criminals of all kinds?". A person that still thinks that there is a significant risk of governmental Bitcoin shut down is not very likely to adopt the currency any time soon. If we could answer "The government could, but that would also mean they would lose their own house and property database in the process, so they won't.", then adoption of bitcoin the currency would increase faster.
So, why does increasing the speed of adoption of bitcoin the currency matter? Well, the world outside of Bitcoin doesn't stand still while Bitcoin is getting adopted. There are competing systems and there is a race of who gets the most adoption the fastest. Very few people use the "Google+" social network instead of Facebook, mostly because Facebook happened to get user adoption the fastest. Being first matters, in cases such as these.
This is on point.

Not a zero sum game, you're right. If there's anyone who understands  what you're speaking to here, it's me. But there's a big difference between bitcoin having a sliver of the blockchain market share versus bitcoin being predominant. Take a look at bitcoin relative to the altcoins -- bitcoin has some ~95% market share of digital currencies, which makes the altcoins by and large worthless and hence effectively without utility.  There is a non-zero chance it turns out bitcoin only has a sliver of the market share and i'm not a fan of news that suggests this non-zero chance is increasing, even if only marginally. I'm even less of a fan of turning away demand because we're stalling on blocksize.

my biggest regret was selling a horde of $250 coins to make a quick buck back when price was flirting with $330. i just bought some at $450 and felt like an ass at the number of coins i was getting relative to the USD spent.

this has restored my faith in bitcoin. shows me the core devs are being organized and proactive. the transparency of it all it is in accord with bitcoin's principles. i'm glad this loose group of experts decided to take the lead here -- with all the uncertainty up till now, god knows we needed it.

Keeping them on Electrum should be fine, if transfering seems too risky to you
