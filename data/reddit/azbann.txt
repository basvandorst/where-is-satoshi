These were the two I was considering as well. Looked all over this reddit and the reviews in the App Store. Ending up going with bread based on what people have said. So far I like it. And they said they are working on eth support so that’s a plus.

This is the kind of thing that just gives fuel to the government regulation argument.

From my understanding they are not FDIC insured. They are insured by Lloyd’s of London against being hacked and having their cryptos stolen.

Because a lot of people don’t have millions of dollars to invest in a risky venture that won’t see any possible revenue (let alone profit) for at least a year.

I’m not going to pretend I know a lot about this but I’ll input my perspective. 
If using bitcoin as an investment then the fees are fine. It’s the same concept that the brokerage houses use when they charge you a fee to buy/sell stocks. I get it, running an exchange costs money and they need to pay for things. 
Where I see fees becoming an issue is when trying to use bitcoin as a commonly used currency.  I don’t want to have to pay an extra 5 cent fee to buy a cup of coffee. Even if the merchant absorbs the fee why not just continue to use credit cards then. 
Maybe I’m missing something but that’s just my thoughts.

I wanted to ask this as well. I haven’t seen any reasons why the two hate each other. Granted I’m pretty new to bitcoin and reddit.
