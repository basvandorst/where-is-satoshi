Out of curiosity, how did you get in contact with vice? Did they somewhat track your node to them or did you talk to them?

Then my point remains? 
I will keep my database stored on my own storages for when their cloud breaks down.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:00:33
So, when they type cloud, they mean blockchain? Sounds more like you'd upload the database to their "cloud", but then again I did not read past first paragraph

It has a bad ending.

Why would they undo mt gox? You are totally wrong, I don't think anyone besides people who lost would back such a decision.

I'm not worried about passwords. I'm worried about the password database (whether its encrypted or not) beeing lost because the storage aspect is outsourced to someones cloud.
I don't know trezor at all, and I did not read the article fully so perhaps that is adressed. But that is my worry, I want to store my own database

The Password Manager then automatically uploads the encrypted data to user’s private cloud storage, making them always available when needed.
&lt; This is almost like keeping your bitcoin in a thirdparty storage
