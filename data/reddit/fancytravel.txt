Because the Bitcoin community persists of a lot of unprofessional users (business amateurs) who blame others instead of themselves plus they make it personal.

I agree, Bitcoin really needs an "app".
OpenBazaar could be it but I see no reason for average joe to use it yet.
I'm hoping that BitPay/CoinBase will do the job by pulling in big merchants.

depends on the context. It's a good ROI for an investment point of view, but I still find it disappointing how few people actually use BTC

That's what I'm talking about. But is this good for the 51% problem or bad?

Maybe it will help if I give you an example. I will try with a simplistic altcoin CPU mining business model.
Imagine some Altcoin that can be CPU mined.
You then write a srcipt that will purchase some Cloud Hosting Instances at various Hosting Providers.
The script will setup the Cloud Instances, setup the CPU miner and earn revenue by mining the Altcoin.
Also, the script replicates itself on each Cloud Instance. (To make this example easy, imagine there are hosting providers that accept bitcoin, so the script even pays for the hosting all by itself).
Now, this script could be your DAC. A business that runs without your help, completely on it's own.
I don't know what's the exact criteria to qualify as a DAC, but this example-DAC could grow completely on it's own by buying further cloud instances (by checking if it's profitable). Also, the DAC would have it's own money from the mining profits and pay you a dividend. If you lose control over the DAC, you might argue that it would be 'on the loose'
Now imagine the DAC has a problem. For example one of the hosting providers changed their website and the script to buy new clouds no longer works.
The DAC could then create a job posting and reward a programmer with it's mined coins when the programmer fixes this problem.
To sum it up:
- DAC maintains it's own money balance
- DAC could reward shareholders with dividend payments (you?)
- it could hire real people for jobs if it hits some obstacle
- it could decide itself it it wants to grow

Another proof that Willy was merely tracking the market (i.e. arbitrage), not making it.

What is the status of ASICMINER actually?
I own a few shares from back then but I stopped receiving dividends.
