I really don't understand what's so hard about trying to work in the US. Yes it can be expensive, but for the US, there are so few solid operators that you'd be very easily able to capture the market. Yeah, it might be painful for now, but open up a US office (It's my understanding that NY is going to be friendly to crypto business) and go from there. Now you incorporate in the US, register with fincen, and start going state my state, starting in the big ones or the ones where you have the most customers. Locking us out is definitely the wrong way to go.

Yes, percentage can matter in certain ways. That being said, no matter which way you look at it, identical relevant posts to both and the one at has a greater chance of reaching more people in an absolute sense, it's that simple.

Sounds pretty cool. I'll have to keep these guys in mind for short run stuff.

How does the wallet handle the transaction, does it spend older coins first, or newer ones?
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:59:27
I disagree. Enabling bitcoin has huge advantages to paypal. Right now paypal has to charge a certain amount when you withdraw because of the way checking works and the way it's processed. Paypal could drastically reduce that fee when enabling withdrawal via bitcoin. 
Same when I sell a widget to someone in EU from the US, they pay with their local currency, and paypal converts that to BTC to pay me. Someone else who got paid in BTC wants Euros out, and they use those Euro's that came in. It really opens up tons of possibilities for paypal and for a new market for them to capture.
Also, they could leverage the technology for their backend, so they handle their internal transactions with their own blockchain. Ebay is recognizing that bitcoin is competition for paypal, but they have an opportunity to leverage it before someone else does, and bring all their experience to it.

I still haven't gotten to 1 bitcoin, the highest I've ever held was .3 BTC back in February.

Lol....SHA256 vs Scrypt is all you need to know. And good luck getting 70+ gh/s of scrypt mining power.

Can you post a list for me so I can see the things you are a saying a currency must have. I'll admit, I'm not an economist, but using bitcoin I can purchase things, I can save bitcoin, I can spend bitcoin, I can earn bitcoin, I can do everything with bitcoin that I would do with a dollar. The only real difference, is volatility, but my dollar doesn't go as far as it did 10 years ago, so it's obviously still volatile to a degree.

I was already into model trains...I feel validated now

Paypal provides the fraud protection, not the US dollar, that is where your argument falls apart.
Bitcoin allows for an additional payment protocol. Now, if they accept bitcoin, and they want to grow overseas, they don't have to deal with exchange rates and such, but rather bitcoin will allow them to avoid all those fees. I'm sure they have all the licenses necessary as well, and it would be very easy for them to be a bitcoin reseller, as well as enabling it for payments on ebay.

17000 users with 17 people visiting when I checked, vs 5 million subcribers with 1800 browsing. If you want to reach an audience with something, you post where the biggest audience is. That being said, make sure your articles are relevant towards the goals of a particular sub and you should be fine.

2 or tthree digital copies
and a couple paper wallets as well just in case, blows my mind. And i'm new to this stuff.

In the US, all this means is that there's enough evidence to charge him with a crime. It still does not mean he is guilty of anything, but essentially, this is not news.

That's also from literally almost a year ago. I imagine that they've done a lot of work on that end. That being said, I only transfer there when I'm cashing in or cashing out, then the BTC goes into wallets thereafter.

Not a scam, is legit, but they have messed up the delivery of the ATM units. However, they have been doing a lot of good things in the dogecoin community and helped to sponsor the Dogecar in the NASCAR Talladega race. They also acted as the payment processor for the T-shirt fundraiser to get into the fall Talladega race.

Basically it boils down to: "dollars can be frozen and returned, but we can't control bitcoins, so use dollars"
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:55:42
It may have started out that way, it's gotten quite a bit bigger. Tonight is DogeCON San Francisco, and next week is the Talladega Nascar Race where Dogecoin has sponsored  Josh Wise to race.

This is funny to me, because I had set up a dogecoin miner using amazon AWS, and didn't know about the ephemeral state of the hard disk. So it rebooted and everything was gone and I was like wtf? I never would host a wallet.dat on a cloud though, holy crap that's asking for it.

That's good to hear, I hope you are able to move fast. I have no idea how you plan to hire or possibly do anything in NY, but if you decide Long Island, hit me up!

How few people are you following that 4 posts set hours apart is "dominating your feed?"
I follow around 80 or 90 or so accounts, and my feed is barely the same over a period of half an hour. After 4 hours, tweets would be gone.

Dude, hold.....it will definitely go up past $650 USD. The fundamentals of the software are the same. The market will recover, probably in a couple weeks. Relax. Don't panic.

My dollars are play and serious money at the same time. In fact I can use my dollars to go to an amusement park or the movie theatre. I can also pay my bills with dollars. So yeah, currency can be both serious and play at the same time.

Yeah, and you have to remember, some people are buying up all these doges. So millions are mined every day and the price is only dropping my 2 to 5 satoshi....that's a lot of buying power. As the block rewards decrease the price will go up. Also the olympics are over and it's hard to hype when Mt Gox fucked over everyone in the crypto world.
