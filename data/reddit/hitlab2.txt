Your coins are secured by the 24 words. If Trezor goes down you can type in the 24 words into any other wallet to recover your coins.

It is not illegal - so they cannot charge you with a crime per se.
However they can still seize (steal) from you by using civil asset forfeiture. Which they only need a *suspicion* that it is criminal money to steal. Being in a crackhouse and carrying cash is enough.

Yes, rootstock

I tend to think Tether is actually backed, they are just doing what they can to work around the banking industry who refuse to deal with crypto exchanges.
HOWEVER huge risk is that if/when some of their accounts get frozen pending a money laundering investigation, that is when shit hits the fan. If they have an account somewhere that is getting 100million deposits per day, the banks will be submitting suspicious matter reports like crazy. Sooner or later they will get the attention of police. Once that happens the authorities will witch hunt bitfinex hard to find any excuse to confiscate the money.

What we are seeing now in AML/KYC is that financial institutions are essentially reporting almost everything that looks slightly weird as "suspicious". Believe it or not financial institutions get raided themselves if they don't generate enough suspicious reports because the government start looking at them as being suspicious.
In raids they start seizing your cash, property and everything not nailed to the floor then proceed to go on a witch hunt in an attempt to confiscate it all with civil asset forfeiture. It is a pretty profitable gig for them.
So regulators are too unfairly hard on financial institutions, then financial institutions in turn become unfairly hard on customers. Treating everyone like scum/criminals and such just to protect themselves. 
I am pretty sure almost everyone here has been reported as suspicious at one point or another for depositing cash or transferring money to an exchange.

You don't actually get a warning when they fire off those suspicious activity reports. It is kind of the point that you are not supposed to know when you are being scrutinized. 
The reports get sent straight to the police or tax authorities, and if it gets their attention you will get raided by the police one morning with a search warrant, and get audited.

How much has bitcoin dropped in the past 3 days Vegeta?

Download Electrum or Mycelium wallet on your phone to setup the wallet. You can find them in the playstore. 
Create a backup of your wallet before sending any funds into it. You can find instructions in the app

The initial seller would have your public key (your bank account number), not your private key (password to access your bank account).
If you lost your private key, then your coins are lost forever.

the website has been patchy for me for the last few hours
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:42:16
the other sub seems to be much more quiet about the price increase

AUSTRAC regulation is not related to exit scams, it is about collecting and reporting private information on every transaction to the regulatory body. 
It really does nothing to prevent exit scams.

it is never too late to get into bitcoin, if you wait for it to drop it may never drop, buy in now and hold it long term
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:44:11
This is a pleasant surprise! 
@_date: 2017-08-08 02:54:34
Reports like this actually give me some pause to investing a big amount in bitcoin right now. Recently we have had nothing but rallies, good attention from media and the financial world. 
This usually means a larger correction of some kind may be ahead. Of course no one can predict the timing, so it is still best to dollar average in right now. 
If you have a sizable amount of capital looking to get in, I would buy small amounts now and wait for a correction to get the big orders in. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:50:13
I agree, for the long term improvement of bitcoin it needs to be stress tested like this. The coin that comes out on top will be better for it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:28:20
Exchanges can just monitor to see if they receive both coins, and credit both to the customer's account. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:16:03

never try to time the market, only buy and hold

If interest rates go negative it would finally make sense to borrow money to buy bitcoin.

It is ok to buy at this price since it is impossible to know how much higher it can go. Just don't do it on margin

You should be able to restore it with the 12 world phrase. Are you sure every word is spelled correctly and input in exact order?
Also did you have another word you used a passphrase in addition to the 12 words? You will need to enable passphrase and input that too.

If you can HODL for life - then it is not a mistake
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:14:54
Instead of cashing out and possibly having to pay tax on your gains. You can use bitcoins to pay your bills in Australia using BPAY 
Localbitcoins is a good option too
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:16:44
Breadwallet, Mycelium or Electrum for a good mobile wallet.
Even better if you can get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:06:43
It is a matter of time before it comes back down, but will it be at 5k, 10k or 15k? It is impossible to predict.
Either way it should not affect long term holders.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:58:26
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:04:04
Can you elaborate why this is not possible? Exchanges can use the BIP32 derivation path to generate same address on both chains for a customer.

I consolidated a bunch of small transactions today using Trezor. I manually set it to 3.025 sat/B and transaction got confirmed after 394 minutes by slush pool
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:24:06
This is a good thing to raise awareness of bitcoin in the general public. Might push prices higher 
@_date: 2017-08-21 05:30:41
Money laundering is also used as a catch-all to justify civil asset forfeiture. In the Australian criminal code 400.9, "reasonable suspicion" from law enforcement is enough to freeze someone's assets. 
You will then need to go to court to prove your innocence.

The app will instruct you to write down 12 or 24 words. With these words you can recover your wallet if you ever lose your phone. 
You will need to keep these words in a safe place because anyone who has access to them will be able to recover your wallet and steal your money.
People usually keep them in a safety deposit box, fire proof safe or some secret hiding spot around the house.

The 24 words you write down when setting up tezor is your private key.

The reasons you have listed only prove that bitcoin has not reached mainstream adoption. It doesn't necessarily mean it is not in a temporary bubble.
With that being said, i do agree with you that bitcoin will go much higher as it reaches more people

You can't go wrong with buy and HODL

People might be buying coins now to get free coins during 2x. After the potential fork the combined coin value could go higher still.
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:36:33
You can buy from localbitcoins.com or the Australian exchange btcmarkets.net
Best thing to do is buy at regular intervals, make a savings plan and stick to it.
eg. Invest 20% of your paycheck every week. 
Set this number to what ever you like. The key is stick to this and don't deviate from your strategy no matter what the market does. So no panic selling or actively trading.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:30:52
The price has gone up too quickly to not have some sort of major pull back.
My perdition: Bitcoin goes up to 6k, then a big ICO explodes causing waves of other ICOs to explode. SEC comes in to regulate/prosecute, the turmoil drags down the crypto market cap taking bitcoin with it. We have a bear market for 1-2 years, then bitcoin experiences the next bubble shooting up to 30k per bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:29:46
The fundamental reason for this drop is not really China ban. It is too much speculative frenzy that drove bitcoin to unreasonable prices. The market just needed a reason to sell off.

@_date: 2017-09-13 06:11:41
I doubt this is because of this news. Chinese BTC prices have equalized against other exchanges.

The indictment is money laundering, not that BTC-e hacked MtGox.
If they had evidence BTC-e did the hacking they would have been charged for it too. But they didn't.
Most likely what happened was the hackers used BTC-e to launder the funds, which just provided the service of an exchange
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:53:40
There is almost no chance of getting it back. They are going to label all the funds "proceeds of crime" and pocket it themselves
