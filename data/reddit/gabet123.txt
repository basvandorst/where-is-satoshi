Yep when the package is delivered and the customer signs for it it releases the payment to the shipper and he gets it within 10 minutes of delivery nice:) I would imagine shipping insurance could give a small refund on delivery also as an incentive to use them vs another.

Hey thanks for taking the time to write back. I was not aware of error correction but that is good to know. What I was trying to get across is that with the multi touch features now on phones it would be cool to have something similar with wallet systems so we could move the QR to a place on the screen incase of a scratch or crack but if error correction takes care of this issue then I guess it is not needed. I will be looking at your system closer. Thanks again.

Because I agree that if you are to cheep to pay miner fees than you should get stuck but I was not talking about that. I was talking about when new people that don't understand that they should add a fee we should have a system to help out so their transaction is not stuck for days which would give Bitcoin a bad name in the mind of the new guy. After ten transactions you should know how it works but the new addresses should be cut some slack.

Well you picked the printer so this is how it can help with that particular item. Lets say you are in a country that is cracking down on free speech. Lets say you want to get a very important message to the masses but you need a printer to do it. Every news outlet has been infiltrated by government agents and they filter and track all submissions and scrub anything that is submitted. If you are anti government they come down hard on you and your family. So the only way to get data out is to post fliers late at night or throw leaflets from building windows. Currently if you went and bought a printer with your credit/debit card that card has your data attached to the purchase of the printer. Now you go and print up your leaflets on your new printer and disperse them to a crowd and escape. The crowd has government agents in it also. They pick up a few of your leaflets and take them back to a lab to be analyzed. The next day you are on your way to work and get pulled over in a remote stretch of road and are arrested and thrown in political prison. All this time you are wondering how did they do this? How did they catch me? What you didn't know is that your printer sprayed yellow dots on all the leaflets you dispersed that give the serial number of the printer that printed them. Your credit card at purchase was tied to the serial number of the printer. It was easy for them to find you. Just a quick query of a database and some good detective work. If you had paid in BTC and had it delivered to a fake address it would have been much harder to track you even if you didn't know about the dots. Currently yellow dots are sprayed on virtually all documents. If you don't believe me follow this link.

An ASIC is an application specific integrated circuit. So they are purpose built for doing nothing but mining. Currently trying to build a mining rig from GPus will make you some money via scrypt mining like  said. Currently it might be a better idea to give your self options by buying hardware that can do both. There is a system called Gridseed that looks interesting. 
There are third party guys that sell them. But for most new guys that don't have BTC Ebay is your friend. 
While I agree that mining might loose money currently I think if you truely want to learn this stuff you need to get a couple just so you can have a full view of the process. People who just buy and sell have a harder time understanding what the true value of a coin is because they have a lesser understanding of the back end systems. Mining will make you a better trader.

For the Hydrogen community it made sense because there were about 20 sites that did one thing kind of like  . I could find forums or photos or blogs or link sites or groups relative to certain aspects of hydrogen research or groups relative to geographic areas but not all in one place. It made it very time consuming to get a good snapshot or find relevant data. You would go to a site that the day before had good data but because it was a ranking system if it wasn't super popular or just hadn't been noticed much it would get buried in all the other junk. It would boil down to trying to post your info at the right time of day to get it in front of enough eyeballs to be voted high enough to survive. So what I did was create a system that helped to find the data easier plus when data did fall away if it was later found and commented on it would come back to the front and center for more eyes to see it. This would keep discussions alive longer and would lead to solutions to problems being found quicker. The hydrogen site was built more for device builders looking for solutions to problems. So I can see why my friend wants me to do it he believes it will lead to a quicker and better think tank for Bitcoin and I think he is most likely correct. It also helped to cultivate relationships and allow people to cross pollinate ideas and or network with each other. So while I like Reddit very much and I think everyone here is smarter than me most of the time I don't feel like we are connecting at the level that will spawn innovation or build teams at the rate that is required to support the industry. I think I can make that better.

I agree! Try writing the Alphabet A to Z then flip the paper over and do it again. A should line up with Z and Z to A and eveything in between. So it should look like this but make sure they line up top to bottom.
Then Draw a box around all the letters that that make the word WIZARD and there corresponding letter on the upside down alphabet. Now flip the paper over and you will see that all the corresponding letters you drew a box around can also be used to spell WIZARD. This is math just not a very obvious version of it.

If the USA had little to no representation in the early years we would be a different country. Granted there is little representation of the public these days but it is still better than most countries.

I'm pretty sure the Dogecoin core development guys just made Doge an infinate amount coin thus inflationary. Good luck I don't see them gaining value. When you have a inflationary system that is to encourage velocity or the movment and speed of transactions. Basically deflation means spend them now rather than later because they will be worth less in the future.
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:10:45
I agree. This is more of an effort to visualize your holdings relative to all others holding BTC. But because we are not in the future at the moment I can't predict how many will hold BTC so I went with the biggest possible at the moment.

Ok that kind of confused me and enlightened me at the same time. Lets say I have a paper wallet and im trying to pull .5 BTC off of a paper wallet to pay for cookies. I scan the private key on the paper wallet and only request .5btc. So does the electronic wallet pull the full coin off the wallet then send .5 back minus the miner fee? Or does it look for a transaction in the past that was .5 and if no transaction exists then build smaller ones into one bigger one?

Well I said stumble not tumble but if they taper the QE to quickly it will create a cascade of issues. One being high interest rates. But what I was trying to say is that the markets are not truely growing it is an allusion created by QE. If I print twice as much money now goods cost twice as much because of inflation. This is no different for stocks they will cost more too just because it takes more dollars to by them not because they company is doing any better. So when the QE stops you will see the world as it truely is.

Im not worried about price. I'm more worried about velocity making regulators treat it like a commodity. If more users were using it right now it would push velocity higher and stabalize the price volitility. This would give larger players like Paypal something stable and more attractive to customers.
