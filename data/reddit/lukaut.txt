Something like global decentralized bitcoin summit.

@_date: 2015-05-03 19:19:22
main point of Bitcoin is decentralization. Bitcoin foundation did not pass  their exam, people who made alot of money on Bitcoin not always can be trustfull (Josh Garza , Mark Karpeles etc). I think that bitcoin mascotte, spokeperson and face is math.
