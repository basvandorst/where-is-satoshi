Flipside/Vice versa with your implied socialized losses alternative. If I moved into a neighborhood and my neighbor gets robbed, no one expects me to cover my neighbor's losses. Similarly for a nonsensical "haircut" percentage I've heard; if a percentage of everyone's holdings were taxed to socialize the losses, then how would fairness play a role whatsoever when some kid takes a haircut off his lawn mowing money or parents' allowance versus a whale eating the same percentage on his much more difficult to recover investment.

1. I was aware of the risks involved with trading on a bitcoin exchange in a world where cryptocurrencies are still very much in their nascent state. No risk, no reward.
2. I have associated it with my risk strategy that allows for such instances and I have hedged. I also have a contingency plan for this loss and have traded back into only a 14% haircut to date.
3. I'm cautiously optimistic in the staff that created a leading exchange to design and implement a thorough plan to recover which offers a more expedient return than an annual revenue garnish to payback its debt holders.
4. There's quite literally no exchange like Bitfinex regarding utility from every country on the planet, save for the US user interim restrictions.

Their track record is to pull through all the FUD.  They're big and slow to move, but after all the years, they have kept staying relevant.
If you base it on history, they'll resolve this.  If you feel that this time something's changed in their ability to pull through, then maybe this will be that one time they don't.  I doubt it.

If digital currencies are considered money there, doesn't that mean that at some point the businesses operating in that state will be required to accept it like the dollar?  I'm assuming they'll bend there an not force businesses to accept it.

Jordan Kelley, CEO at Robocoin, describes the firm's plans to ship 8 bitcoin ATMs to Taiwan and Hong Kong this month.
Speaking on Bitcoin, "We have Overstock.com just started to accept it, we have Starbucks rumored to accept it..."
That's all he said.  I've never heard this rumor before him saying it and certainly haven't read anything substantial to support it.

In before someone links you  
The **only** thing people tend to go off of is an anonymous reddit/twitter troll that's developed a psychosis while on a fishing expedition for the past year, AtlasRand1/ He's banned from everywhere I believe. If you've ever read investigative pieces or performed research before, you'll find  to be sorely lacking anything beyond ordinary, base conspiracy with conclusions tilted 90 degrees in favor of his delusion, naturally of course.
