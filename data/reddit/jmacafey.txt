We know from the silk road seizures that the US government can lay claim to bitcoin in the same way they lay claim to USD that is used in drug operations.  We don't know how far they will go.  This was already done to GOX.  It's definitely possible that he cut a deal to save his neck for one reason or another. The BTC sits.  See below link as an example.

Its even possible that terrorists were using GOX to hold money like they may through any other bank.  This would give the government cause to threaten, scare the hell out of Mark, and for him to fold.  Battling banks and feds would not be easy, it would be frightening.  Hell, even owning bitcoin feels like a crime these days.

This could turn out very poorly ....the business becomes a form of bitcoin insurance in this case.  If you spend bitcoin and the price goes up suddenly....return return.  This exemplifies some of the difficulties bitcoin has at being a currency in itself.  
The return in BTC has to be prorated to the value it had at the moment of purchase to some currency, likely usd.

It's converted to USD right when they pay correct?  So if you have to refund it would be that?

Why is there no mention of the government freezing bitcoins, putting a gag order on the operation, and forcing Mark to cut a deal due to his involvement in the silk road?
