So here's a fun question. Let's say you're bidding on these coins, and you win. The rules require the entire amount of BTC to be transferred in one transaction, and the winner has to pay the miners' fee (effectively deducted from the BTC they send you). What wallet/setup would you use (and trust!) to hold over 2700 BTC securely? And what fee would you ask them to set?

Just Google for "amazon bitcoin purse.io stolen credit card" and browse the results. A few are pretty obviously shilling for the site or have a vested interest in getting people to use it. Others are more open, with both positive and negative results.
Here's a couple of examples of a negative result that came up pretty quick:

That site is dubious at best. It lists the price of Bitcoin on Jan. 1, 2017 as around $2073.19, when in fact, it was right around $1000. If it can't even get historical data right, then it's not even worthy of being a meme site, let alone a serious prediction site.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:22:24
Weren't there reports that a substantial fraction of Purse.io purchases at Amazon were performed with stolen credit cards? The upshot is, the receiver of the goods is the only "real" person that's traceable, so if either Amazon, the CC company, Purse, or the banks choose to go after someone, that's the person on the hook.

The original post is still up on the bitcointalk forums; you can see the thread here:
The guy checked in again in 2014 (among his last posts on the forum, in fact) saying that he pretty much spent the bitcoins as fast as he could get them back then.

The "manufacturer's" site - he still doesn't have a formal site up, but he's selling them through his blog.

It's a clever idea, but I see two issues with it. First, this could have been the perfect way to set up a hardware cold wallet, but they explicitly advise against that. Second, at over $10 a piece, they're way too expensive for something that's disposable. Bring them down to $1 each, and I'd buy a bunch just for the novelty.

I think he was pointing out how things have changed in three years - Back then, prices were based on Mt. Gox, and bitcoin was in the $100-200 range. Oh, and Paypal was also feasible, as people were less aware of how it could be used for scamming.

Something's screwy here. Several somethings.
The coin in the image appears to be [this coin]( which is sold directly by the US Mint for $180. It nominally has 1/10th of an ounce of gold, which at spot would cost around $130. So how and why would these guys sell it for $110? They'd literally get more by melting down the coin for its gold value.
Then let's talk about the "lifetime limit of ten coins per household, absolutely no exceptions." Down below, they say "Special arrangements now available for orders over $50,000." Given that you can only order $1100 worth, who exactly gets these special arrangements?
I'm almost tempted to call them just to learn what the rest of this scam is.

Odds are pretty decent that whatever got you banned from Coinbase would likely also get you banned from other sites. That said, you can check out Gemini. They're one of the largest exchanges with decently low fees. (I believe it's 0.25% for low volumes.)

I doubt it's stupidity; it's more likely inexperience combined with a confusing UI. Here's a similar thread from a month or two back, that had the same issue.

Coinbase is terrible if you're doing something shady with your money or bitcoins (shady by *their* definition, not yours), or if you can't follow their directions for setting up your account, verifying your identity, and setting up your bank info. They also have pretty poor customer support if something does go wrong.
That said, here on Reddit, we hear a crap-ton of horror stories because people who have a problem tend to complain loudly and publicly. But it's incredibly rare that someone would come to Reddit and post, "Today I bought and sold bitcoin through Coinbase and nothing bad happened." People don't complain when they're happy.
Given the size of Coinbase, I'm pretty sure the number of silent, happy users far outweighs the number of complaining users.
Oh, and happy cake day! :)

Now you got me curious. I went back into my account history to see what I've done in the past.
Buying bitcoin via Coinbase (not GDAX), it took five days for the bitcoin to be delivered. The purchase request was submitted on Monday; the cash left my bank account on Wednesday, and the bitcoins were available to withdraw on Friday. This was about a year ago.
I don't appear to have bought bitcoins via GDAX recently. However, when I sold bitcoin via GDAX and requested a withdrawal, the cash appeared in my bank account the next day. This was within the last month.

If you're sending BTC from Coinbase to your Electrum wallet, then what matters is what Electrum shows. In Electrum, do you see the balance you sent from Coinbase? It should show as an incoming transaction. It doesn't matter if it shows as unconfirmed for the moment - the key question is whether you see the incoming transaction or not.
If you see it, then you can check whether it's confirmed or not. It's not unusual for transaction to take some time to confirm; the mempool is presently rather large, so it will take some time for all transactions to get confirmed in a block.
If you don't see it at all, you'll need to wait a little longer. I remember some of my withdrawals took up to six hours to show up after I submitted the request to Coinbase. Make sure in Coinbase, it shows that a withdrawal was requested. I don't know if it shows the withdrawal address as well, but if it does, double check that you entered it correctly. Other than that, just wait.

You're almost certainly looking at the dollar value of the BTC in your wallet, not at the BTC itself. If you had, say, exactly 1 BTC in your wallet, and you last checked your balance about a month or so back when the price was $3200/BTC, and you checked it again today when the price is $4000/BTC, it would appear that someone sent you $800. But in fact, your actual BTC didn't change, just its dollar value. The random $30 increases you're seeing are from the price going up a smidgeon over the last few hours. I'll bet if you check now, it probably dropped a little, since the price of BTC has gone down slightly from its peak a couple of hours ago.
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:28:06
What wallet do you use? And when was the last time you checked your balance before the mystery $800 appeared?

I followed the same train of thought some years ago. Any rational investment adviser will tell you diversification is a good thing, and as we always say around these (virtual) parts, never invest in bitcoin more than you're willing to lose.
That said, I've had good luck buying gold from a company called JM Bullion. They have fair prices, fast shipping, responsive customer service, and best of all, you can pay in bitcoins! Until recently, their prices when paying with bitcoin were the same as paying with cash, but recently they started adding about 1% over cash for bitcoin payments. Still substantially cheaper than paying with a credit card.
There's a few other companies that let you buy gold or other metals with bitcoin, but I've never used them myself.

I don't get it.

If you're verified on Coinbase, then you can use their GDAX exchange platform. The funding takes about one or two days to clear (from a US bank account, at least), and once your account is funded, trades are near-instantaneous if placed as market orders. As a bonus, you'll pay a much lower fee than the Coinbase purchase. Your coins are available for withdrawal immediately, subject to their withdrawal limits.

That's not at all close to how it works.
First off, the tax rules are very dependent on which country you're in. So, everything we say here should be run by a proper accountant or tax advisor in your jurisdiction.
That said, there's a few standard ways to account for things like this.  The most common is first-in, first-out (called FIFO). Using FIFO, you would have sold the bitcoin bought for $1500.
Another method commonly accepted by the IRS is called the average cost method. You calculate the average cost of your bitcoins, and use that as your basis. Since you bought two BTC total for $4500 total, your average cost is $2250, and that's the cost basis you use for the coin you sold.
A third method recognized by the IRS is called "specific lot identification." Basically, you can pick exactly which coin is sold. This allows you to customize which method you'll use. But be aware - the IRS expects you to choose one method and stick with it for an extended period. You risk an audit if you choose a new method every trade, or with every tax filing.

First and foremost, make sure you have an unmodified backup of the wallet file from 2013! If something goes wrong with your experimentation, you may lose whatever coins you do have in there. Ideally, back up the original file onto a thumb drive and remove it from the PC, then experiment with the copy left on the PC itself. If something goes wrong, you can restore the copy from the thumb drive.
That said, my first question would be, from where did you download the Core client? Make sure it's an official site.
Other than that, try removing the wallet.dat file from the config directory, and start Core. Let it download all blocks to get up to date. Then exit Core completely, and put your wallet.dat file into the config dir (overwrite the default one Core will create). Then start core with -rescan and see if that works.
If it still bugs out, there are a few other command line options you can try:
    -zapwallettxes=&lt;mode&gt;  
    -upgradewallet  
    -salvagewallet
Try them one at a time, in that order. If one doesn't work, exit Core and restore your original wallet file, then try the next. You can read how these work on the [wiki](

It was two pizzas for 10K bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:13:47
My guess is, you're looking at the dollar value of the coins in your wallet, not the number of bitcoins. The value of bitcoin relative to USD has doubled (more or less) over the past few months. You probably have the same number of bitcoins as you did before - they're just worth more now.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:42:43
Check the date on the most recent "receive" (green) transaction - is that the date you last recall receiving bitcoin from someone, or transferring some coins to your Bread wallet?

Interesting. Your transaction appears on blockchain.info, but not on blockr.io:
It looks like a valid transaction, as far as I can see. Maybe it's just a propagation issue? It may not have reached the miners for some reason.
What wallet did you use to send the coins? If it was bitcoin-qt, you can keep your bitcoin client open, and it will rebroadcast the unconfirmed transaction periodically until it eventually does get confirmed.  
There's also some services that will let you broadcast a transaction directly; here's an example, though it will take some effort to get your transaction into the raw format this requires. The link has instructions.
Assuming it's not a propagation issue, then you're just stuck with the rest of us folks waiting for low- or no-fee transactions to confirm. There's currently some competition for space in blocks, and transactions with moderate-to-high fees frequently fill up blocks, leaving no room for those with low or no fees.

As a guy who has to deal with this way too often on a daily basis, let me point out that "it didn't work" isn't helpful in figuring out what's wrong. Tech support guys really need more details to understand the issue you're having. "It didn't work" could mean anything from "Tails failed to boot" to "The download didn't succeed because my Internet is down" to "The ZIP file was corrupted" to (honest to God, this happens more than you'd think!) "The power is out." It's roughly the equivalent of a patient going to the doctor and telling him, "Doctor, I have an ache." When he asks where it hurts, the patient replies, "I don't know! Just fix it!" It would be more helpful to say something like "My wrist hurts when I twist it like so. It started last week after I fell and landed on it."
In your specific case, I'm guessing that when you double click the HTML file, you get a white screen in your browser and nothing else. This means that you skipped the step of extracting the zip file and tried just double clicking on the zip file. That won't work. Instead, right click on the zip file and choose Extract from the menu. Then open the folder that was created (not the zip file this time!) and double click the HTML file in that.
If this isn't your issue, then you need to be more specific. List out every step you tried - literally every mouse click and everything you typed, from the moment you booted the machine on. Then give details about the error. Was there an error message? Did you get a "spinning" mouse cursor that wouldn't go away? What specifically made you realize there was a problem?
EDIT: Ignore the below. I was running the VM without enough RAM, and that was causing the problem I saw. Once I gave it enough RAM, it ran normally and generated the encrypted addresses without issue.
~~I'm testing this now in a Tails VM. It seems that in my VM, I can download the ZIP file and extract it. I can also open the HTML file normally in the browser. I can generate non-encrypted keys without issue. However, when I select the BIP38 option and click Generate, I get the "spinning" icon indicating the page is doing the processing, and it doesn't update past that. Eventually the entire VM becomes unresponsive. I'm not sure if this is because I'm running Tails in a VM; I've encountered issues before where things break in a VM but work fine when running Tails live. If you're running Tails live and you get the same issue, then it may be that some of the privacy tweaks done to the Firefox browser in Tails break something in the Javascript used by bitaddress.org. In that case, try sending an email to the guy who runs the site with the details. Maybe he can debug it.~~

Reading the article and the paper, I think those are intended to be relative terms. That is, it's expected that there would be more users than servers in the network.
Nevertheless, the paper does note that this is a client/server solution, not a peer-to-peer solution. The network's performance seems to be limited by the server-to-server connections more so than by client-to-server connections.

I'm sorry, but that's flatly incorrect. I just opened up my bitcoin data directory. My bitcoin client was running. The database directory was there. Then I exited the client. The database directory was promptly deleted. I restarted the client, and it was recreated.

It looks awesome, but I have to wonder at the practicality of putting the QR code on the bottom. A traditionally designed piggy bank is easy to put coins in, and hard to get them out. In contrast, with this coin bank, the code on the bottom makes it rather inconvenient to do a quick deposit! My suggestion would be to put the (deposit) QR code somewhere where it would be easily visible, and give the user the option of putting the (private key) QR code on the bottom if they want.

Just a general note for those who may not be aware: estate planning is VERY locale-specific, and can turn on really persnickety details. Each jurisdiction can have totally different rules on things like inheritance, the right way to prepare a will, or even the validity of a will (I know some places don't acknowledge wills at all). Even a lawyer who doesn't specialize in estates could end up making some rookie mistakes that would invalidate the will. If you do decide to get legal advice, make sure your lawyer is both admitted to the Bar in your area, and is specialized in estates and inheritance.

Look for the wallet.dat file stored in your bitcoin data folder on the old PC. On Windows, it will usually be in:
On Unix, it will usually be in:
Copy that file to a USB thumb drive or something, then find another PC that can run bitcoin-qt reliably, with enough room for the blockchain and so on. Back up any existing wallet file on that PC so you don't lose it, then copy the file from your thumb drive to the bitcoin directory on the new PC. (Keep a copy on the thumb drive as your backup in case something goes wrong.) Then start bitcoin, and it will load your wallet file with all your bitcoins still there.

If you got an exe file anywhere during this process, you did something wrong and your Tails install may well be compromised. Delete it and recreate from a clean ISO or Tails install.
Once you have a clean install ready, start Tails, wait for it to connect to the Internet/TOR, open the browser, and go to this address:
This is the official site for bitaddress.  Do NOT use this to create your keys while you're online!  Instead, near the bottom of the page, you'll see a "zip" link to download the official site HTML directly from the github source. Click on it, save the zip file somewhere you can find it, and after it downloads, close your browser entirely.
Next, find the file you downloaded and unzip it. (Don't just double click to open it; it won't do what you want that way.) Find the bitaddress.org.html file inside the unzipped folder. If you're particularly paranoid, you can verify the GPG signature on it; otherwise, just double click the file to open it in the browser. Now you can create your keys as normal.

Interesting. The database directory only appears if the client is running, right? So in this case, the user can't run the client because he's out of space. The database directory should not exist at that point.
