I guess, think it's because they don't want to be associated with online gambling.

You don't lose anything by accepting Bitcoin as payment so why not?
It's not like you're not accepting the other payment methods anymore.
Don't worry about customers paying the Bitcoin fee. I'm sure everyone on this sub will be paying with Bitcoin at your store if you offer it...
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:16:47
Yeah it has limited access in UK
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:18:43
Love that website. The difference is, they pay in bits rather than satoshi. 1 bit = 100 satoshi.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:21:16
It's not like every merchant is going to start accepting straight up bitcoin overnight. This is a good step closer to that goal, though.

don't think changetip is working like you said in your post

Coinbase doesn't ask for ID just enter your bank and credit card.
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:15:57
That would be cool
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:27:42
that'd be my guess
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:13:10
Thanks. Also, is it true I shouldn't use bitcoins bought from coinbase to play? I've heard they can cancel my account if I do so. Are coins from localbitcoins safe to use if they haven't been inside coinbase yet?
Pardon my ignorance, new to the bitcoin game.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:57:23
Id love to know as well!

Helium mixer is completely free of charge. Just takes an hour or two though. It's a .onion link which you can prob search up. If u send to another exchange then pay it won't get Coinbase off your back. They track it.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:59:43
I'd use a bitcoin mixer to be safe. There's one called Helium, which I've used and seriously recommend. Don't have the link on hand but I'm sure you can search it.
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:40:00
Keep it in an offline wallet
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:17:53
Oh shit, good idea for sure. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:35:19
Ah, gotcha. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:33:09
Gotcha. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:49:22
I'm interested in helping as well. Want to partner?
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:49:38
Nope, must have bank account linked and verified by your last 4 digits of SSN.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:24:22
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:31:10
yea you could, but I'm sure you'd go crazy solving captchas 24/7
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:23:33
Anyone know what exactly this is? Clearly a scam, but by just putting my wallet address, I have nothing to lose.....
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:57:47
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:00:40
Anyone know good poker sites?
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:07:07
Yup makes sense
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:06:02
Ahh I see. I'm sort of new. I know you're probably exaggerating a bit, but is it really possible/probable that bitcoin goes over $1000 in the next few years? Seems like that was just an outlier in the past because of hype, right?
@_date: 2015-12-27 17:48:22
@_date: 2015-12-13 05:19:44
1. Make a Coinbase account
2. Buy bitcoin
3. ???????
4. Profit
@_date: 2015-12-15 07:31:21
Word. Thanks man.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:14:05
Hasn't happened to me.
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:06:15
My favorite moment was me getting started in Bitcoin just a few weeks back and owning 1 already! I'm a noob but can't wait to see what next year holds.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:51:02
? how is this true, there's no transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:10:20
Yeah I'm having a similar issue. I'm trying to verify my address and last 4 SSN digits but it keeps saying, "Unknown Error Occurred".
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:16:42
That second link is basically what I'm looking for! Thanks a bunch. Of course there's core, but I feel like I wanted to start out with something smaller first. Appreciate you bringing that project to my attention.
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:36:52
I asked another commenter this already, but what exactly IS BIP38? I currently use electrum, does that quality as a BIP38 wallet? 
And if I lose my laptop, can I use my 12 word seed on a new laptop and get access to my Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:56:06
Thanks a lot! Video helped for sure. Appreciate the help.
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:04:57
Oh wow, that is extremely cheap. Can't believe I haven't heard of this. I may even get the Nano. Still very cheap.
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:22:33
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:14:50
Oh wow! Thanks so much.
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:27:37
But nobody knows the private keys...
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:25:40
Yes it's the end right now above 410
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:23:39
Gotcha. Have to take that into consideration. Thanks for the input.
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:11:18
Yeah haha that part did not sound like too good of an idea
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:12:39
I was looking into it but the price tag caused me to post this question in the first place. It's not too expensive but if there's not a significant advantage over other alternatives, may not be worth it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:58:16
Transfer it to an offline wallet like Electrum while you're still deciding on a hardware option.
@_date: 2016-01-12 01:52:11
Thanks for the response. Electrum qualifies as a BIP38 wallet correct?
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:35:28
Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:59:21
Nano or the HW.1?
@_date: 2016-01-08 16:17:01
Hi dudes 
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:11:10
I should have mentioned, I may want to spend a small amount occasionally as well, not simply for cold storage. After reading into the Ledger more, it definitely seems like the best option for this type of use case.
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:30:49
Oh man, you shouldn't have haha. :) Thanks a bunch. And I sure will pass it down.
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:04:29
It's for buying and lending. Once you sign up, click the "Get Bitcoin" tab.
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:51:54
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:49:25
Shit, I didn't mean Helium, mean Helix. But yea, I think this is the link: 
You don't even need local bitcoins for this. I've sent coins straight from coinbase to here and then the remaining back to coinbase.
