To the app's credit, it warns you to give it read-only access.
It also supports tracking prices and profit/loss by directly entering amounts, if you don't want to give it a wallet address or api key. Plenty of options here for people concerned with security.

Definitely work on getting that Ledger Wallet and moving your coin to it. In the meantime, Coinbase has a cold storage option that's a little bit safer, but still relies on trusting Coinbase 100%.

With the IP address, you could also look at what AS was announcing it. 
To validate the rdns record, check for a matching A record.

3% is pretty standard for credit cards fees. I wouldn't consider it cheap.
The company I work for sells a camera system for $2500. $75 of that never makes it to our bank account because our card processor keeps it (actually, it's a little less than 3%, but you get the idea).
When small businesses start seeing numbers like this, the shock often drives them to make poor decisions like turning away customers who want to pay with credit cards.

That's a bold statement. Could you link to the precedent?

Lost currency is essentially removed from the money supply, like it was never mined in the first place. It makes all the other bitcoins slightly more rare, infinitesimally increasing the value of all the other coins.

Bitcoin has function in that it is a decentralized way to exchange value electronically.
