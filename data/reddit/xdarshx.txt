Well he does care about opinions of the people, who pay him. Which is the last kind of person I want working on Bitcoin.

I personally really enjoy being able to simply scan a QR code to make my purchases. That to me is better than giving out bank information, or credit card numbers which could be intercepted or stolen just as easily from someone who doesn't take proper security measures. I like that I can post my wallet address to receive payment without fear someone will drain my account, I also don't have to give out or request any personal information to receive that payment. There is incentive to use Bitcoin you just have to be more open to the possibilities.

I have had a donation QR set up on my twitch page for a while. Granted I'm not a big name streamer. Sometimes I even put a small bitcoin logo up in the corner of my stream and I often get asked about it. Tipping in chat would be an awesome addition to Twitch!

Already wrong thanks to the tip bot. I got my first .02 btc from a random tip here on reddit exactly 1 year ago this month. Now I accept btc for donations on my twitch account (along with dogecoin) without having to setup any payment services,  I simply posted the QR codes to my profile page. I believe in bitcoin and the potential it has for the future.

If it's any consolation, I absolutely love OBS, you've done an amazing job!

I wish I had more than one upvote for this!

Bitcoin was meant to be a currency. Spending it isn't just a "nice to have" it is Bitcoin's purpose. I like spending it at restaurants and especially with online merchants because I like not having to use my credit or debit card information. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:08:48
Bitcoin is NOT a get rich quick scheme. Bitcoin is a currency with the purpose of being exchanged for goods and services. You don't seem to have a full understanding of what Bitcoin is. 
Also what do you mean "it will never work"? I have been using Bitcoin since 2013 and it's paid for my VPN services my Twitch.tv turbo account, I've even made purchases from Frozencpu.com for some water cooling accessories. I've brought my fiance out to eat paying with Bitcoin. Just this past week alone using the website Purse.io I bought a GoPro Session along with a deep dive housing and a Cheerson CX-20 quadcopter all paid for with Bitcoin.
I think it's working just fine, but that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:39:44
Hence the debate is censored.
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:37:57
No it goes against my beliefs to censor debates in order to sway people to your side simply because you have vested interest in a third party that will make you money. It's not about miners setting their own fees it's about people milking extra fees from users. I am a miner and I have turned my miners towards XT. All the censorship seems shady and makes it sound more like a scam rather than a solution. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:05:46
XT is Bitcoin. Limiting the discussion to influence the opinions of others is a cheap way to try and fool people. I for one will do everything to avoid any scheme that will eventually force me off chain to make a transaction due to a limited blocksize.
Edit: i.e. Blockstream and Lightning  (avoid like the plague)
@_date: 2015-08-19 16:54:53
Because third parties can charge their own fees and rates to allow for such speedy transactions. To me that's shady and goes against everything I believe Bitcoin to be. I use Bitcoin as a currency not a way to make money. Forcing people off chain to third parties is a way to skim a little extra off the top. So yes it solves problems but it makes someone else money, when we could solve that same problem without paying any extra fees for a third party service.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:40:32
The point of Bitcoin is to be a currency not just a way for people to profit. Bitcoin isn't supposed to make you rich, it's supposed to be a currency. Everyone keeps looking at Bitcoin as some sort of money maker when really it's supposed to be money.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:43:41
There is no name calling this a direct quote. It's a clear sign he's willing to use his power to manipulate people's opions for his own benefit. The fact that he has anything to do with BTC is dangerous in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-09-02 02:11:22
He sees no evidence, because it was all deleted. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 05:11:58
It's my personal opinion that I believe Blockstream has Bitcoin by the balls, I say that in reference to your comment about big business.
Edit: Sorry not your comment but the one I commented on.
@_date: 2015-11-02 02:35:40
Blockstream does.
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:53:37
Bitcoin is a currency not simply an investment. If you invested all of your "real world hard earned $$" in hopes of making a profit well then you're doing it wrong and I don't feel bad for you or anyone else who made such a stupid decision. Why would you ever invest in something more than you could safely afford? That's just not smart. Bitcoin's is meant to be a currency, many people like you look at it as a stock that is going to make you lots of "real world $$". Meanwhile I use Bitcoin as "real world $$" to make purchases and it has always been flawless and fast. This technology has changed the game and I'm excited to see Bitcoin's future because it certainly has one!

Slower reader with no time to read but plenty of time to type out a response. Value our time and stop typing.

Based on Blockstream making up the core developers of Bitcoin. Based on the fact that I believe their ultimate goal is to have Bitcoin succeed in a way that makes use of their services (or some other third party) to make transactions. That is at least my understanding of why they want smaller blocks and why everyone is anti XT. I believe Blockstreams decisions are made to benefit them and not just Bitcoin. The rampant shadow banning, censorship and trolling from Blockstream employees  (like Luke Jr.) has only further pushed my opions in that direction. People argue that one person in control of Bitcoin's code is a bad thing but I also believe one company having control over the code is bad.  
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:35:11
I have and was given no response, yet I'm continuing to be down voted for saying  "BTC is not failing by any means."
@_date: 2015-10-29 13:28:19
Oh you mean Blockstream?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:10:13
I remember when Bitcoin was cheaper than Western Union. Thanks to Blockstream Bitcoin is losing it's appeal. Well done.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:59:16
What was it you had on mind. My idea is more of a way for people to try and win some bitcoins without actually needing bitcoins to start. I haven't worked all the kinks of the idea out. I myself have a very small amount of bitcoins (not even half of one) and I would love to play a game of some sort to earn rewards in bitcoin. If I could spend $5.00 and buy some lotto tickets for a chance to win either small amounts or even large jackpots. All money made would be converted to bitcoins and used as prize money. I understand this is very basic and I am open to better ideas.

You never invest more than you can afford to lose. He took a gamble and lost. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:44:54
Funny you post this because just hours ago I was thinking I somehow wanted to start a bitcoin lottery of some kind.
@_date: 2013-10-26 22:26:12
I'm very, very new to the world of Bitcoin and I'm not sure I understand fully what is going on here. Are people giving each other Bitcoins as friendly gestures? If so I think that's really cool. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:38:59
Everything went smoothly for me as well. Took a while but it all went through fine.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:37:00
So could I maybe have 1 bitcoin then? :)
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:11:01
I had another idea of creating something that would allow you to earn bitcoins by playing video games. Say maybe a website you sign up for and win bitcoins for achieving certain milestones, or winning tournaments. Joining would be free.
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:42:52
Wow! I can't really thank you enough, this is my first bitcoin ever and I am childishly excited about it right now! Thank you so much, this has certainly made my day.
