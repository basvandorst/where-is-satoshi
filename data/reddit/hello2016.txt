Exactly, I remember a brief period when Ebay orders had to be paid via bank wires. Yikes. When Paypal came around, it allowed people to get refunded on bad orders or lost deliveries.

Eh, they made online retail much easier during the late 90s through 2012-ish (when Square and Stripe etc came knocking down). They’re still pretty OK.

People easily forgot how ecommerce websites were built just a few years ago. You had to sign up for a payment gateway and figure out how to install their developer kit. Fucking LOL... now you just copy and paste some embed code and voila.

That doesn’t sound so bad, it actually seems responsible that they want to prevent money laundering schemes. Wouldn’t this be easily corrected by going through support? Just my opinion, which take it for what it is, Paypal has done more good than harm overall and people like to shit on it because they probably weren’t around for its early days. It was absolutely world-changing.

I think you’re being melodramatic

Maybe, that’s up to their product manager

I would guess you take mining costs minus profit and tax that amount

You won’t be in deep shit as long as you pay them. The IRS is nice like that. Chances of them auditing anyone here (unless you made hundreds of thousands or more) = slim to none.

Just write it down with a Sharpie pls

He outright said pay your taxes. It’s just that there are always loopholes when it comes to personal income tax, whether manufactured by the individual or the system.

I read OP’s quote perfectly clear and spent all of my life savings, including my 4 children’s college funds, into acquiring Dogecoin. Gotta go all the way!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:25:37
Recommendations for each of those would be appreciated! I want to get my coins off the exchanges.

Let’s say you bought BTC for $100 and held until its value is at $100,000.
$100,000 of BTC traded for about $100,000 of XRP = pay taxes on $99,900.
$100,000 of BTC traded for $100,000 of USD = pay taxes on $99,900.
The amount of tax you pay depends on if you held for at least one year (max. tax of 25% on your $99.9k) or if you did it below one year (between 5-35%* depending on your income bracket from last year’s tax declaration).
* l am not sure if this is accurate but from what I understood it’s in that ballpark and I am too lazy to look it up but I hope you got the point.

Less adoption rate, more expensive to maintain the infra. The more people that use it, the cheaper it becomes.
