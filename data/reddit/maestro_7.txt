I bought 1 LTC today at 195$
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:04:32
And I will tell my grandchildren I buyed for all my money in that day
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:18
Buy buy buy
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:22:57
I belive bitcoin will never go over 16k again
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:37:33
Well, it dropped again to 15k. It doesn’t seem going to 20k ever again. So why not? You really think you can pump bitcoin with this everyday propaganda? Don’t be silly.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:45:38
Aaaaaand it’s gone
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:26:43
Dont worry, we will be fine.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:45:23
Did you hold any bitcoins from that time?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:45:28
How much does it cost?
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:14:44
[discount btc](
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:48:16
Maybe, but I think things in crypto are going faster these days. We will see new ATH sooner or later. Maybe in 2 years but it will happen.
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:49:49
I know you hate this question, but let’s have a meaningful discussion and try to analyze what is the possible answer of this months old question: When moon?
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:04:03
Why? Because it did in 2017? Lol. You don’t know nothing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:33:34
McAfee said BTC will hit 15k by mid July. According to this analysis, it could happen.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:00:30
Why would paypal support Bitcoin when they have their own currency called “Libra Credits”?
@_date: 2018-05-28 10:09:24
Now is time to buy
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:34:05
We touched bottom. Several times. First time 6k, second time 6.8k, then 7.9k and now 8.4k. Lower lows. Next stop: 10k to 1. of June. You’re welcome.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:21:41
Do not fear people. We gonna see 10k sooner or later. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:30:44
But that’s the lesson we all should learn for future.
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:00:56
Load ze dip
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:45:27
yeah, lower highs as well, but with low lows it makes a triangle and breaking point
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:27:11
It should start recovering IMO
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:48:21
Bitcoin chart on google trends looks awful.
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:55:28
Please don’t ask me that
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:41:38
I sold at 8200 and buyed again at 8600. I went full retard. I can’t believe that happen to me, I have experience in this shit.
@_date: 2018-05-06 17:02:08
31st ofc, i misstyped
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:29:20
I have very simple tactic:
1. Holding my current coins in case this is the bottom
2. Having ready 500$ in cash to buy more on monday if it dips further
3. Going all in and buying 1 BTC if it falls near 6k after that
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:06:27
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:26:03
That’s just my TA.
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:22:30
But they wouldn’t if they didn’t sell.
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:27:52
6k here we come
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:06:01
Tron is rat poison squared. They are down whole day and I ironically commented on their sub “bullish” and actually got upvotes, lol.
@_date: 2018-05-11 07:49:28
6k here we come
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:23:24
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:55:07
Time for a good ol’ beating
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:42:38
Buying cryptocurrency is probably the worst decision of my life
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:09:51
We will fall next 7-14 days, then new bullrun starts.
@_date: 2018-05-15 13:19:44
10k in sight
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:20:40
Green dildo.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:19:35
Why do you think next bull run will happen in December? It may happen in any month.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:57:37
When homeless?
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:22:32
MtGox moved 44k BTC to another adress. They are getting ready to make next big dump. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:05:44
Imagine if this was just a dead cat bounce, and it falls to 7500 tomorrow. Than I would be stupidest trader ever.
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:48:49
Me too
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:48:51
Loool. Just tether boy.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:21:25
Expecting a huge green dildo to take us at 8k instantly.
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:11:23
My stupid ass tethered at 8200, now it is 8500. �� Hope it will fall down to 7k.
@_date: 2018-05-31 05:35:15
Bye bye shorters ���� 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:33:06
If a short, I will regret it. If I don’t short, I will regret it. Whatever I do, market will acr opposite.
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:40:29
Relax guys, it’s just a korean new year 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:47:13
Makes me feel I’m a fool
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:25:52
Today is the day. It will either turn bullish or bullshit.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:23:52
Ponzi is over. Thanks for participating.
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:54:04
I’m sick of hearing this.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:33:43
SHORT IT
LOUDER 
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:53:32
That’s the “bear market incoming” signal
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:56:24
I’m sory, bitcoin is most powerful and innovative technology in the world? How deluded can you be my friend? We have robots, computers, cars, smartphones, plains, spaceships, but sending ones and zeros from computer to computer is suddenly most powerful thing in the world? Bullshit.
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:22:32
God please ���� Just one more bull run to 9k to give us a chance of breaking even. Then make a 2 year bear market I don’t care. Just give me a chance to exit. Sincerely, your child.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:01:26
I just can’t believe you’re going to lose 90% of your money just because of HODL meme. Damn.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:51:06
It will be time to sell at 3k
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:19:20
What a dump. Shit. It’s a bull trap.
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:56:16
I want it, where I can buy it?
@_date: 2018-06-03 21:37:27
I decided. I’m going all in on BTCC next few days. I don’t care. YOLO
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:51:06
Institutional money left in January.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:40:35
15k this month.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:10:12
Guys if you haven’t seen this, you must click. This is a game changer.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:13:23
Why would I sell at 7k when I can sell at 4k later, good point.
@_date: 2018-06-10 05:14:58
No, it will not. I bought in February hoping it would be better in summer. But it’s worse. And it will continue to dump whole year. Cash out and invest in real things.
@_date: 2018-06-11 04:56:54
Don’t worry, we have strong support line at 1800$.
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:50:26
I guess I won’t be seeing much of a words “moon” and “lambo” on this sub anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:06:56
BTCC is next Bitconnect
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:50:44
Sell sell sell sell
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:40:38
We will either enter a 2 year bearmarket or hit 15k this month.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:25:57
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:25:13
Bro you just copied my post.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:31:14
Tripple bottom? More like octuple bottom Since January
@_date: 2018-06-10 04:53:16
I was so stupid to believe in that propaganda, now I’m losing my money. Fuck crypto. I’m cashing out and never coming back again. And you are so deluded that you will buy every dip and gamble everything you have for ones and zeros on your computer. 
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:24:27
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:28:49
It could also be Monero if you want
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:34:39
I got u fam
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:50:45
I wonder how this reminding posts are going to age, lol 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:05:32
Where is bottom? 5k?
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:28:09
no, 1 btc is always 1 btc
