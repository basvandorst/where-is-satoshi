I think the volatility is the first major issue.  
It’s great for the “get-rich-quick” hope, but if you had enough bitcoin for lunch when you left the house this morning, and then get to lunchtime and you can’t eat.... it’s an issue.

It’s a currency by definition in that it is exchanged for some goods. 
It’s not backed by any other hard asset, such as gold, or government, which though taxation and spending, forces some monetary value. 
As such, it is only worth what people think it is worth. No more, no less. 
So the question is, is it possible that People will believe BTC is worthless?
The answer is yes. 
People will lose faith if:
1. Volatility prevents some expectation of value over some reasonable time period.  
2. People believe that the pricing is artificial or being manipulated by some “greater power”. (Unfairness)
3. People believe there is significant fraud or theft occurring.
4. The hassle of use becomes greater than the perceived value. 
5. Another easier to use alternative presents itself.

This is funny, though I’m confident there are subreddits dedicated precisely to this.

That is hard core.

One works when the power goes out. 
One does not.    
   
Gold has value beyond its monetary uses.  It has very unique properties that are useful for many applications.   
  
As a safety currency, when all hell breaks loose, reliable power and communication are likely to be the first things to fail.   
   
In such an environment, Bitcoin won’t have value.   
   
As the political, economic, and infrastructure stability of a country decrease, gold increases in value while. Bitcoin’s value should decrease.   To some degree it’s a bet on stability.

That is waaaay more active of a sub than I thought it would be.  Thanks! :)

This is true.  
 I bet gold will aid in solving those worries more though. 
  
People will still value it for quite some time if only for the psychology of it.

I believe it’s possible he’s sent USD to coinbase, did not in fact buy bitcoin with them, and then transferred the USD to binance, thinking they were auto-converted into bitcoin?

That’s a lot of trust in altruistic motivations of the government and the people performing their duties. 
The “if you aren’t doing anything wrong, there’s nothing to fear” argument.    
Things always start out for the greater good.  Later on, we learn that absolute power corrupts absolutely.  By then, it’s normally far too late to do anything about it.

How would the US gov/IRS know that they had bitcoin and sold it unless they self report it?
