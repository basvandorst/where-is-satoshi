Children can't give consent, due to them being minors. That's why we have special laws protecting them. If the porn was made, purchased, and viewed by consenting adults, though, they should be allowed to go nuts.

So, if there's no way to predict future action, then what do you do with your money? Toss it in the closet? Me, I try to save and invest in things, and every bit of information helps make a more informed investment and one that is more likely to be more positive. Where does all information come from?
Right...past events
So instead of giving a factually untrue line essentially claiming finance is no more than a dice roll, you could say "There are a lot of variables in the market that affect prices. As such, we cannot make a guaruntee about returns." At least that's true.

Never said (or implied) perfect, but the past is the *only* indicator we have for the future. We don't know the future, but we do know that things have patterns. If we can pin down these patterns, we can use them to predict the future. It most assuredly is not perfect; no soft science is, because of the huge number of little unknown variables. That's why financial managers include the CYA line in advertisements, to cover their ass. Thus doesn't mean that general trends can't generally be predicted to be generally true. But, like any generalisation, it's wrong sometimes. That's a fact of life. That's why you invest cautiously and include CYA lines.


Studies of...what exactly? Past events, perhaps? 
If you can't use past events to predict the future, then those studies that use past events to predict that 'past events don't predict' the future are invalid.
Again, I'm in no way saying "Bitcoin is a bulletproof investment that that will always be increasing in value" because that would be stupid. It does have a lot of volatility and unpredictability to keep in mind. That said, the "past events" line is BS because information from past events is literally the only way to predict the future, unless you have a crystal ball.

When they buy stocks, where does that money go?
When they buy gold, where does that money go?
Also, you completely dismissed capital investments, which do directly help the 'little guy' with jobs, and depending on the business, services or goods.

So...you're going to transfer it to someone else for free or are they going to pay you market value for the crypto? Because if you're 'selling' for free (or equal to/less than purchase price), there's no gains and hence, no cap gains tax. If they're buying at market value in person with cash, you still owe capital gains tax, you're just fraudulently hiding it.
Whether or not you or I agree with the tax is one thing, but I can't see how you get gains from the crypto without legally owing taxes.

Bitcoin (same as fiat) does have zero *intrinsic* value. Gold has actual uses, bitcoin is bits in computers. I'm not saying that gold is 'worth' more than bitcoin or that you should invest in gold over crypto or anything like that, but to think that bitcoin has intrinsic value is foolish. Gold does have some intrinsic value, as jewelry or for electronics. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:53:21
My point is Bitcoin, for all of its benefits, has one and only one use, as a medium of exchange. If it can't fulfil that, it has no value. Gold can not be a medium of exchange and will still have value. That's not a small or unimportant fact.

"When I let go of this vase last time, it fell to the ground and broke. It happened 3 times. But since past events do not predict future outcomes, why would I expect the same thing this time?"
Look, I understand that Bitcoin has heaps of both volatility and uncertainty, but I really hate the "past events" line. All it is is CYA bullshit for people who manage money so they can wash their hands of responsibility.

Just because not everyone can predict it doesn't mean it is completely unpredictable. People thought the sun circled the earth, but if the opposite was visible "everyone would be Galileo".

Except intrinsic value. We don't subjectively use gold in electronics and aerospace uses, do we? Yes, gold is inflated in price past that alone, but my point is that *intrinsic* value is not subjective. Hell, even a dollar bill can be used to write a note or snort cocaine. Bitcoin has no such intrinsic value. How is that even up for debate?

So Warren Buffet got wealthy by, what, winning the lottery? Repeatedly?

Gold is also used in electronics. I'm not saying it's not got an inflated value, I'm just saying it has some intrinsic value. Bitcoin doesn't.
There's no reason money shouldn't have another use. Actually, it ensures the currency can't fail 100%, it just goes back to being a commodity, examples include gold (now too costly for currency use) and Zimbabwe dollars (now too worthless for currency use, but still works to start a fire). Money just needs to be something you can exchange that everyone agrees on, with some form of rarity. Dollars fail on the latter point, while bitcoin (and gold nowadays) fail on the former.
I'm in no way saying gold should be our currency, nor am I saying not to buy Bitcoin. I'm just saying that he Schiff isn't wrong about the benefits of gold; he just doesn't see the better benefits of cryptocurrency.

It doesn't make me trust you. It makes me trust that you are less able to screw me over. It's not a fountain of brotherly trust.


 
Near everything? Revolutionize our lives?
Not really. With widespread adoption it will provide for a less manipulable currency, as well as providing some banking benefits without having to trust a bank. That's about it. Not to say those benefits are not grest, because they are, but don't ascribe this mythical "solve all the worlds problems" property to Bitcoin.


No. Blockchain technology will provide some benefits, but again, Bitcoin is not some fount of miracles. 


No. No it won't, and that's coming from an ardent supporter.

Uhhh....because not all cycles/patterns are less than a week long? That would be like assuming the temperature will go to 0K in a year because you're a month into winter. The seasonal cycle takes more than a week, so you have to zoom out on the temp graphs to see the actual longer term pattern, which you can use to predict 90-100°F temps around 7 months from now. Using only the past week would be cherrypicking (or just irresponsibly analyzing) data.
You have to use all the data (which are the mumerical results/representations lf past events) to obtain the best possible future fit. Again, I'm in no way saying it's bulletproof or is a sure-fire predictor, but financial markets aren't random (like a dice roll); they just have a metric ass-load of variables that are hard to account for. The variables that affect them the most, if properly noted, can give general trends that are generally true. That's part of why Buffet is rich is because he's really good at analyzing investment opportunities. Just because you and I can't predict things as well as him, doesn't mean there's no accuracy to prediction. And yeah, even he makes mistakes, because the past isn't a perfect predictor, but he is evidence that it is a whole hell of a lot better than nothing, in the right hands.
Edit: Based on the rises and falls of the past few months, I made an educated guess once the dip started that the price would bounce back at 10-11k. It did so at 12.3k and is back around 14 and rising now. That's what I mean by patterns being relatively predictable.

That past events can be a valuable predictor of future performance, as long as you include a 'risk included' caveat?

Net neutrality is not a libertarian ideal. The libertarian ideal is to tell the government to "stop fiddlin with it". Also, democrats want to raise the minimum wage and socialize healthcare.

What business owner, hell what person with any business acumen and a smidge of ambition, *wants* to sit on money? The only reason to sit on money is fear of needing it which is something exacerbated by higher costs, such as higher taxes. Any businessman worth his salt would use every spare (ya know, beyond that emergency amount) cent to spur more growth. Lower taxes, higher net income, more money shoved into business growth. Higher taxes, lower gains, larger necessary emergency funds, and significantly lower investments.

I'm in a similar situation as OP and am planning on getting a wallet. I know Trezor and Ledger are the big names. Should I get one over the other or something else entirely? Further, is either (or both) going to have support to dump the B2X for more BTC after the fork?
