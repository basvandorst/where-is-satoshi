Well it's still interesting when a large terrorist group is using new technologies.
ISIS is using twitter, tumblr, youtube, facebook, even reddit, to share its propaganda. That's pretty new, so if they used bitcoin, it would be newsworthy.
But I am not sure they do, since there is no real proof they do.

I am following both bitcoin world and Syrian civil war, and it would not surprise me in the slightest.
*However.* This article has provided zero actual sources and just made stuff up.
The first source - [ZDnet artice]( - mentions F-Secure analysts, talking about how ISIS attracts smart hackers from the west (and that's true, and it's dangerous), and then, separately, talks about how cyber-criminals are discovering bitcoin for use-cases like crypto-lockers. Both of these are true, but there is no connection between ISIS and Bitcoin there. It's not a bad article per se though.
The other source [is a weird article from security affairs]( It, again, provides no real sources, or even citations from any intelligence agency reports! The only citations are
(1) people saying "Hmm, it would be bad, if terrorists used bitcoins!"
(2) link to the ~1 year old infamous document of an online ISIS supporter "Amreeki Witness", who wrote - in a totally unofficial matter - a document, writing something like "Yeah ISIS could use bitcoin, it's quite anonymous". However it was just an ugly MS Word document, written by one person, who (very probably) weren't even in Syria, and there is no evidence they were actually implementing it. There are lots of online ISIS supporters (even on reddit) and they write a lot of things, most of it is bullshit. 
And *that's it*. That's all the sources they mention.
Now what they forgot to mention is the unofficial ISIS propaganda website that existed for about a day "khilafah.is", which actually *did* have a bitcoin address on the bottom. But it was quickly brought down from all the hostings, and it did not revive.
I am not saying ISIS is not using Bitcoin, or that they will not use it in the future, but there is no real evidence - even as a quotation from CIA/FBI/White House/???. This news is completely manufactured.

If you can get through the *terrible, terrible* installation process and the kind of crappy GUI and the fact it crashes randomly, I would recommend Android version Electrum.
Electrum has deterministic key generation, so you just need to safe the seed mnemonic and you can use it from your mobile phone without the need of regular backups. It's the best of both worlds - it's super safe and you don't need any complicated backup system.
But the installation procedure is super crappy, and the app itself is far from stable.

@_date: 2014-03-16 02:22:24
I frankly think the reason is that the whole model is simply strange.
I pay a fixed price, yet the the pieces are distributed equally. So the more I "tip", the less individual tip get - and therefore, one "tip" can mean vastly different things for the reciever, based on how much the tipper tips on *other* websites. All that is counter-intuitive for both sides - the receiver and sender.
Compare with Kickstarter, which is super-easy to understand.

First BIP-32 supporting Android wallet (that I know of) is on Play Store, and it's what I will be using from now on (and recommending to everyone). The positives are multiple.
* deterministic key derivation (like Electrum) - that means that to back-up, I just need to save the primary seed (+version), and that's all I need to know for getting my bitcoins back, once my phone gets lost/the apps stops working
* unlike Electrum, the key derivation is standardized in BIPs and will work with other HD wallets (AFAIK, only DarkWallet currently supports it, but I don't really understand their gateway/obelisk architecture at all, and if BIP32 works with stealth wallets at all; bitcoin-qt probably has HD version; and of course there is Trezor, read further)
* unlike Electrum, the installation on Android is sane
* Android in general has better sandboxing of applications than PCs, so I am not afraid of keyloggers or similar bullshit. Basically my bitcoins are as safe as they can be with really easy usage.
* The only issue is that currently, once the app has started, you can send the bitcoins away with no need to re-enter the password. So the safest thing is exiting the app after sending the coins. I added this as a github issue though, so maybe it will be fixed (  )
* you can set different accounts and coins in those two accounts *never mixes together* (bitcoind has "accounts" but they are kind of useless) - I personally have 2 accounts, "more private" and "more secret"
* ....and it all *actually works*.
So, if somebody asks me for the safest way of using bitcoin now, I will recommend installing Wallet32, backing-up the seed offline, and exiting the application after every send just to be sure.
My favourite feature, which has more to do with MyTrezor than Wallet32  - you can go to  - even without Trezor - and import xpubs ("public seeds") for the accounts. You can then use mytrezor.com as a "watch only" wallet. Which is kind of useless, but it's a great demonstration of hierarchic wallets. It's primarily used for Trezor owners (so that's what the necesarry plugin is for), but it works as a watch only wallet too. I hope it's not secret, but since MyTrezor website is open source on github - while horribly, horribly undocumented - it shouldn't be that secret.
The application doesn't apparently show up in Google Play with Nexus 7 and phones without a camera (this pull request should fix it though -  ), however you can still install the apk (  )

proof that he used it:
However, this message could be some old message reposted. It sounds out of context, and it's strange he used his old, mostly unused key.
edit: oh, so apparently, the date on the keyserver is meaningless and can be faked. Well, that changes things. This is probably fake then.

Frankly, I don't think Amazon will implement Bitcoin soon.
Amazon operates on a super-thin margin. They can't do that with holding bitcoin - the value is just too unpredictable (search your feelings, you know this to be true), the current exchanges wouldn't probably scale to the Amazon volume if they immediately converted it there, and I don't think Amazon will be building their own exchange until bitcoin is bigger.
It's probably chicken-and-egg problem, but I don't think we're there yet.

As far as I can tell, Wallet32 uses Bitcoinj.
Yes, it is a one-man show. And it doesn't have that many installs either (Google Play shows 10-50 installs). I understand your concerns; on the other hand, I want a wallet that I can actually use rather than future promise.
Also, more wallets using the same standard, the better. Electrum is planning to use BIP32 too. I just like that there is a wallet that has it finally implemented. However I understand your concerns

It doesn't mean you can freely exchange their altcoin and BTC. It just describes that the altcoin provides two types of transactions- one non-anonymous ("like bitcoin") and one anonymous (zerocoin mint/pour).
It's a very poor explanation that makes it sound it's somehow connected with bitcoin. It's not.

In all seriousness, Redditcoin seems like a solid contributor.
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:04:21
What does it mean?
They do own it, in the sense that they do own the source code and they are the ones writing it, they just publish it under a free license. They can add something like disabling the extensions.
Sure, someone can fork it, but try to fork and modify something as insanely complex as Chromium, and keep it up with the upstream....

@_date: 2014-05-19 13:05:38
I am quite sure they are not. (I am sorry if I am mixing zerocoin and zerocash, I still don't understand the difference fully.)
They call "zerocoin" the anonymized transaction. You put in one zerocoin (the transaction works only with pre-determined transaction size), you put out one zerocoin, and then that zerocoin can be spend "as bitcoin", meaning *if the coin supports zerocoin*, you can then *spend that coin*.
Even the paper is still written from a perspective "we want to add zerocoin to bitcoin. how to do it?", not "we want to do an altcoin". Read this in section six


It's quite confusing in my opinion, but once you understand what they mean it's OK.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:09:09

What I am angry about - all the conflicting public messages are just bullshit on bullshit. Nobody says openly what happened exactly. First, it was just "we will fix this with Bitcoin developers", then "we will fix it in a week, just wait", then "we are monitoring the situation", then all of a sudden "we lost everything, oops."
It's just.... I have no clue what is going on, when does he lie, when does he speak the truth, and at this moment (as a person with 0 BTC invested in this) I am just tired and feel like stopping following the news for a while. Since nothing they say is truth anyway.

I *think* that the group of devs, making bitcoin (and having the "final say" over its design) are a separate group, led by Gavin Andersen; however, Gavin recieves some money from the foundation.
If the foundation stops paying him, he still remains the head developer.

I had to read the mail several times and I am still not sure what the author wanted to say. He doesn't want... trains somewhere? also something with criminals? I guess? Something with trains.
However, I don't think it's necesarilly proof of Dorian not being Satoshi. For example, he could have spend more time with the abstract with some grammar checker. He could have had a proof-reader. He could spend more time on the paper than on the mails.

I personally think it's just *lack of bad news*.

I am currently inspecting the code.
Without fully understanding it (since it's 100% undocumented, expectedly so from a hackaton project) - it seems like they are using another, non-blockchain-based P2P protocol, defined in node/ folder, for most of the actual market-y stuff.
I am not sure if I got it right, but it seems that the protocol is build in a way that you have to be on-line in order to sell and buy things and once you disappear, your items will disappear from the market too.
Also there is no way to search. It seems that it's just a list of people, everyone sells something, you can look at his stuff (I think, not sure),  order from him and leave him a rating. (I am not sure where is that rating saved though... probably just broadcasted in the P2P network.)
Seems like an early prototype, by reading it. The hyperbole around it is too big in my opinion.

So you then need (1) a trusted party, that guarantees BITSTAMPUSD is worth the actual dolar, and (2) another trusted party, that works like exchange between BITSTAMPUSD and BTC
so you then have 2 points that can fail instead of 1 in the case of today's exchanges...

Really, as much as I hate shitty pumpers on reddit and elsewhere and as much as I hate scammers who misrepresent the positives and downplay the negatives, *stuff like this bitcoin cafe* is what bitcoin needs. A fun way to introduce people to the currency that won't cost them too much and won't make them broke if it doesn't work out.

General feedback:
Looking at your website, I have no idea what it does. It... lets you somehow promote videos. I get that. But what does it mean? Where are the videos posted? Is it spammed on reddit? Is it spammed on Facebook? Is it one of those sites that pays bloggers for "organic content" (that end up being spam anyway)? What is going on?
Maybe it's not targeted on me as a user, and I get that, I just... don't know what's going on.
If I was a video publisher, I would be afraid of low-quality clicks, and that your company is providing some of that.
OK. To your main reason:
...are you saying "world's biggest brands pay for ads in Bitcoin"? As in, GM, Colgate, etc. pay in bitcoin? Or I misunderstand?
edit: Oooooh. Only now I noticed "where will your video be played". That sort of answers my first half, but I would still be a little distrustful even after seeing that. Who actually sees my video?

Flattr tried something like that. (You can somehow fill Flattr with bitcoin... I think.)

Yes. Or at least it's the only thing that makes sense, since they don't define or describe any "bitcoin pegging" anywhere.
Zerocoin was originally meant as just an extension of bitcoin, before they decided to do their own altcoin.

Frankly, if Kraken gets more popular, it will have to implement similar measures.
Money-laundering is a serious business, and governments don't like it. Bitcoin can and will be used for money laundering (like cash), but governments will try to stop it as much as they can. I am not sure how it is done in your country, but if I bring a lot of cash to my bank, they do want all kind AML stuff.

I am going to counter a bit there
If they solve all the problems with zerocash and actually implement it, and the feature being successful, I see no reason why couldn't *that* be added to bitcoin later.
It's specially designed to be able to add it to other blockchains. (Their paper actually still refer, quite confusingly, to their main chain as "bitcoin".)
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:48:37
It was *never* Magic The Gathering Exchange. The original owner used the domain, because he *thought* about making the magic exchange, but then they wrote bitcoin exchange instead and used the domain.
*That* was sold to Karpeles.
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:09:15
Altcoins can experiment with features that will never get into the main bitcoin.
Experimenting in general is fine - even Gavin Andersen says that Bitcoin itself is an experiment. However, some of the altcoins are build not as an experiment, but as a pure pump-and-dump.
In general, you should treat most altcoins as scams (especially pre-mined/those with pre-sale/those with "IPO"). 1 in 10 might have some interesting feature, but even that probably isn't worth starting from 0 and having to have separate miners and separate blockchain. 
The rest might be OK, but even more experimental than Bitcoin, so treat it as such.

Again, it's a matter of scale. 0-conf is *not* fine if you have a high risk of fradulent transaction and/or doing large money and/or dealing with someone anonymous.
In a bar 0-conf is *maybe* OK, since one payment is not that much and you simply won't let the guy in again anyway; if he, however, order suspiciously lot of stuff and seems too much in a hurry, just wait those few minutes.
Not sure about for example malls/big shops, and again, it probably depends on the number of transactions and the risk involved.
If I was running a shop, I would *probably* wait for 1 confirmation and let the customer wait. Not sure though.

@_date: 2014-04-20 22:56:38
But this "dumb argument" is actually true. Bitcoin *right now* is too volatile. Maybe it won't be in the future, who knows, but *right now* it is too volatile.
And I am speaking with people that actually use bitcoin, have bigger or smaller stashes of bitcoin, and most of them just don't want to use it in a bigger way - because "who knows what it will be worth next year?". Most people use it just as an investment - "it will grow indefinitely! jump in and take the ride!" - most of them don't use it as a payment, even when it is possible. "It's easier in fiat in the end" - that's what I hear the most.
Also, for example, the employer would be totally fucking crazy to, say, have a regular wages set in bitcoin. Because nobody has a clue where will the price go.
Yes, in the faaaar future, it will maybe be really useful for day-to-day transactions, as e-mail is, but let's face it, you never know which technologies will be used in the future, really. Apart from e-mail, we used to have BBS/Usenet, we used to have Gopher, we used to have WAP for mobile phones, we used to have "virtual reality" predictions since the 90s, and more recently, people used to hail XHTML and/or "semantic web" as the "next big thing". 
How do you know Bitcoin will be sucessful like e-mail has been, and won't go the way of Gopher, WAP and Usenet?

Are you sure about that? I have heard that bitcoin-qt has problems with this and the unconfirmed transaction still shows up as unconfirmed, when a new, changed transaction was already confirmed.

You cannot regulate bitcoin and *not* regulate other cryptocurrencies. From the point of the law, the cryptos shouldn't be distinguishable - after all, there isn't a legally binding Bitcoin definition, the whole thing is run just by consensus.

As I said in a different thread in these comments, it's just kind of poorly written. Some parts of the paper assume bitcoin is implementing Zerocash and describe it from that perspective. However, it *will* be an altcoin and it *won't* be pegged to bitcoin, or any other altcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:22:32
Ok, here you go. The problem is in how bitcoin-qt searches for unconfirmed transactions and available outputs - it gets too slow if you have too many of them. (That's unrelated to what you said - "verifying the entire blockchain". Yes, that can be done easily.)
*gmaxwell: the code in bitcoin-qt that finds coins that are available to be spend is O(N2!) (factorial of n2) or something like that in the order of unconfirmed transactions, so it gets insanely slow when you have a bunch unconfirmed payments.*
*nullc: Some have criticized their use of custom software here but it is a reasonable and common practice for a service of its size and nature. The reference client's wallet is basically suitable for small scale single party use. I would not recommend something like MtGox use the reference node wallet, at least not without a healthy layer of abstraction on top of it— relieving it of duties harder than key management and chain monitoring— or otherwise improving it greatly.*
So here you go.

ummmmmm.... yeaaaaaaah. "some anonymous feature".
to actually reply.
You can use bitcoin with Tor nowadays if you want, as far as I know.
I am not very strong in this, but I think Coinjoin is problematic, because - as far as I know - it still requires either some central authority (blockchain.info implementation), or some public channel with people publicly sending their coinjoin requests (darkwallet implementation). Also - the point of coinjoin is that it does *not* require a hard fork.
Zerocoin/zerocash, which you didn't mention, is a nice idea, but it always seems "just 3 months away". There is zero implementations right now. If either with anoncoin or zerocash devs finally make it work, it would be worth considering a hard fork, but right now it's just academic talking.

I don't think inflation is Doge's problem.
No real features is Doge's problem. Oh, it has quicker confirmations, well tons of altcoins have those and it doesn't really help them (and it's voodoo anyway, it's less safe that way). Oh, it has bigger numbers? Well pretend Satoshis are the main currency in BTC and you have big numbers too. (It actually is in the protocol anyway.)
It has silly community? Well that's not a feature of the currency. It sponsors cars? Well that's actually funny, but again, *it is not a feature of the currency.*
All in all there is no reason to actually use Doge. And I am not saying it with a hate in my heart - those guys are funny and it was a nice lighthearted episode in crypto history, but really, picture of a dog, quicker confirmations and different base currency doesn't really make it that different.

It depends.
If you want to be sure (there is for example more money involved, or it is more anonymous environment), you better wait for at least one confirmation. (1 conf. is fine. 2 are super fine. 3 are rock solid. 6 are paranoid.)
If it's just small money and you sort of believe the other person is not robbing you (for example, at a smaller pub), 0-conf is *probably* enough, most of payments will be OK. It's similar to payments with a credit card... it can be fradulent too.

In open source lingo, "forking" means just copying the project (in this case, the licences) and making some changes.

The number is the same as the number in one of the old postings, so the hacker would need to not only set up a call center, but also set it up at the same number. 
On top of that, the hacker would need to have hashes of all the passwords (wrong passwords don't work), plus access to the website, plus mapping from usernames to user IDs (that did not leak, AFAIK). 
Also, the Japanese on the website seems correct, so the hacker knows Japanese too.

I have read the actual JP Morgan report and you know what? 
Most of their points are kind of valid. Of course I don't agree with the superiority argument, but they are *not* talking out of their ass, it's well written, they clearly state their viewpoints why they don't like bitcoin and they are points worth considering. Yes, it's a conservative view, but it's also not wild "it's ponzi scheme for junkies" accusation.
For example this.


This point has actually been true for most of the history. Yes, bitcoin wants to bring a little anarchism and voluntarism to the currency definition, but this is all *pretty new*.

When blockchain fork happens, it *sucks*. I currently have no time for deep explanation, but basically, there are two versions of blockchain, some people have one version, other have another version, and *you cannot send money from one to the other*.
Essentially, it creates two different coins. Fortunately, all bitcoin blockchain forks were caught up in time and nothing really important happened.
The thing is, however - if you want, you can fork the blockchain, but if nobody accepts your fork (no miners), it's kind of useless. The problem is when the community shatters. And yes, it happened a few times. Read for example: 
In this post, I used the term "fork" for BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN FORK. It has almost nothing to do with forking a software/repository on github.
The fact that two different things use the same name is kind of confusing. Yeah.

If he needs to sell it on bitstamp, there is no reason to send in with bitcoins in the first place, no? 
The only reason why bitcoin would be used in this case is that there is some problem with the banking system (international banking blocks, anti-money laundering, high banking fees), but with the need to wire it from Slovenia or UK or wherever BitStamp has its bank, it's pointless to go through bitcoin in the first place

It's an interesting question.
Mandarin uses a different alphabet and different syllables (every letter is exactly 1 syllable; some words are 1 syllable, most words are 2, some are more).
However, their writing system makes it kinda complicated to bring in new words. What they are doing is using special characters, that don't have any real sense (or lost their original sense, or just don't make sense together in that way), and somehow get "close" to the original pronounciation.
So my name - Charles - is 查尔斯 - three syllables, cha er si. It doesn't really mean anything. (I should also add the tones, but I won't because I am lazy.)
The same with the first part of the word "bitcoin" - 比特 - which is "bi te". Again it doesn't mean anything (surprisingly, they use something else for "bit" as in "computer bit"). For some reason beyond my knowledge, it can also mean pitbull (the dog).
The second part 币 is "bi" and it's the same bi as in "renminbi" (人民币) - "people's currency" - that's the name of their currency (yuan).

You can do whatever you want if the code is yours and you are the author. You can dual-licence it, relicence it, make it fully proprietary, whatever you want. (That's why there are a lot of softwares that are dual-licenced even with full GPL, for example MySQL.)
Sure, if someone has the old copy of the code, it's stil LGPL. SL can't sue anyone if he uses the old code, which was LGPLd.
The only problem would be if Satoshi Labs included LGPL code from other authors, but I don't think they do

The gist of the issue is - during a firmware update, seed is kept in RAM, and then evil firmware can read it, even when it's not signed, when you do a soft reset (rebooting without connecting/disconnecting).
It is fixed in 1.5.2 by putting the secret information into the part of the RAM that is always overwritten during firmware update, even with the current bootloader.
If you update to 1.5.2, the attack does not work. Even with physical access. So you should update to 1.5.2., and it will be made mandatory later.
(Official firmware is always signed. If bootloader detects it's not signed during update, it wipes flash storage. What it doesn't do (in current devices) is wipe all the RAM, it wipes only part of RAM; in 1.5.2, the secret info is kept in that part of RAM.)

Hello, I am responsible for the fork at trezor,
I am not exactly sure, but I think that Bitpay didn't see the current architecture as ideal and try to build on bcoin instead. (Or maybe btcd? I keep confusing them.)
Currently, you need to maintain a C++ patches (with the additional indexes) on bitcoin-core, but that code keeps on changing - core maintainers keep on refactoring the code - in a good way, but you need to keep on with core changes. (Also, on each altcoin you want to support, you need to add those patches.)
Also you need to keep maintaining the additional layers in node.js (+ angular).
It's actually quite a PITA to keep it all updated and working for all the alts, but it works for us so far.

Am a TREZOR webwallet dev.
We are supporting segwit in HD wallet according to BIP-49 -  - which uses BIP-141 defined P2WPKH-inside-P2SH.
I think we are the only GUI wallet who supports segwit addresses "natively", for receiving.
Bitcoin core supports them through RPC, but it's through addwitnessaddress call, which is a little awkward IMO (  ,  ). It doesn't support them in the Qt interface I think (I don't actually use the Qt interface at all :( )
Interesting side-point - you cannot sign text messages  with the segwit addresses, since there is no standard yet and it's not clear if there will be -

The theft is far from impossible. It's actually pretty easy.
The so-called "bitcoin wallet" is a file, with which you can send the bitcoins wherever you want. Once someone steals your wallet, your bitcoins are gone.
On some of the virtual storages, the wallets are stored on the server. Once some hacker gets on the server, he has all the money.

If you want to generate just one bitcoin account, you can use the vanity generator
use it as ./vanitygen 1 , it will churn up private key in WIF format and address.
however, it is generally not that good idea, since it's not that useful, in my opinion. What is better is to use Electrum and generate a deterministic wallet, and you can do it offline.
There was a nice tutorial somewhere on this /r/ on how to do it with Electrum, maybe someone will find it and link it.

I am not a heavy user because, quite frankly, there is nothing much to buy with them, so I have them mainly for the novelty value and, yeah, things that I want to buy anonymously (so I am not going to write them explicitly). I am not buying THAT much of them, though, so yeah, it's mainly novelty value.
Benefits: it's kinda fast, it's kinda anonymous, it's fun to use, and I can trust the algorithms (well... I still think eliptical curves are "magic", but well, I trust that other people have had looked at it). 
Drawbacks: the price isn't stable. Once it's 20, once it's 100, once it's 1000, once it's 600 (usd per btc). The volatility is hurting it heavily. Some people then start see it purely as investment, and that kind of sucks.

It will "stabilize" by falling down, because as it rises, people will stop spending it, and as they stop spending it, nobody will have reason for buying more.

I agree. He talked about the positive things (untracability), the negative things and he didn't say anything that was untrue. He advice people not to buy bicoins because it's not a stable investment - and you know what? *He was right*, it is not very stable investment.

guys... I am not sure if you are not confusing things.
GPL, even GPLv3 is fine to deploy on server and not publish the changes. Unlike AGPL (Affero GPL), which is stricter than Affero.
Also, I am not sure if they are using other GPL'd code than their own (I see bitcoinj there, but that code is Apache'd). If all their code is their own, they can do whatever they want with it.
So from legality perspective, they are (probably) fine; I don't think any code they use is under Affero.
If you are afraid they give your shit to NSA - don't use web wallets, period, and use only wallets you compile yourself. Duh.

You should ask support of Bitfinex.
I am not sure how Bitfinex works, but in general, if you filled in bitcoin address to litecoin client or vice versa, it wouldn't leave the wallet at all. So the litecoins must be somewhere.
Can you look into litecoin blockchain?
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:09:23
Despite what this /r/ will tell you, it is a problem, of sort. If bitcoin rises like this, it will stop people from spending. You see it in this /r/ too - "I was a fool to spend my bitcoins on XY instead of holding it for a few months."
However. If people are not spending, the value will go down, because nobody will be buying except for speculators. So, the market will find an equilibrium. It is still finding it though, and the bubbles/crashes are proof of that.

* The background letters are Japanese letters. Japan is not really that relevant in Bitcoin world (yeah, Mt.Gox is there, but they are not really Japanese). *At least* use just Kanji - or, better, simplified Hanzi characters, since most of the trading is probably on mainland China :)
