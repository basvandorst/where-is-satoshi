i'm all for crypto but I would have done the same if I was in Facebooks position.

I'm telling you guys, we are about to go into a bull market.

Auch shorts getting rekt!
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:53:01
My friend bought at around $16k and sold at $8k. When BTC reached $13k he bought again and ended up selling just below $10k because he thinks we are going down again geez.....

Bcash Would become completely untrustworthy, exchanges will delist it and price would plummet. It could very likely be the death of bcash
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:03:44
I don't support increasing the block size when it's not necessary like Bcash are doing but in this case yeah, I fully support a block size increase to 4MB.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:28:55
Hopefully exchanges will start seeing how much BCH is hurting the crypto scene with constant FUD and finally start delisting it.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:31:27
I wish people would stop buying all these shitcoins and just stay in BTC like the old days...
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:04:15
Really? Who is the issuer?

It's already out.

I really wish ledger live would support ERC20 tokens, that is the only thing holding me back from buying one..

Merchants will need to have a tablet like an ipad to accept payments through the sparta app.
Something like this will never get any traction as a very very small amount of merchants will even consider adopting it \- Also there are much better alternatives if you want to make payments with crypto.
Save you money, don't throw your money into this.

Since the main reason that none of these Bitcoin ETF proposals have been approved so far is concerns over market manipulation and liquidity, Bakkt might be the gateway to overcome these concerns.

I would rather keep my crypto on an exchange like Coinbase or Binance than having it in a Wallet on my computer.
    Best thing by far is a hardware wallet like Ledger og Trezor.
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:13:02
Stop whining. Do the KYC
@_date: 2019-12-14 21:27:19
Governments making crypto illegal so that it can't be traded or exchanged legally anywhere would pretty much be a death sentence, despite what people might otherwise think.

Replace illuminati with BCH
@_date: 2019-04-08 10:35:36
I agree that LN is probably much farther away than people think. I also support a small block size increase to 2mb. I understand the upside from keeping the blocks small but the upside from increasing the block size is much bigger than the downside it creates.
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:11:33
Those things are in demand because they are addictive and gives people pleasure in one way or another.
Bitcoin dosen't have those characteristics.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:09:32
It's times like these I really hate the 1mb block limit where you have to pay +40 sat to get into the next block.
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:21:13
Much more likely that it is greedy ICOs selling and keeping almost the entire crypto market down.

Tell you what guys, if I ever become a multi billionaire I promise that I will buy $1 Billion worth of bitcoin which will increase the market cap by at least $60 billion!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:35:28
People are delusional if they think bitcoin will ever go to $1000 again with the amount of attention it has.
The estimated circulating supply on exchanges are 4 million bitcoins. At $1000 per bitcoin a billionaire could buy a million bitcoins with "only" a billion dollars. That would take out 25% of the supply circulating on exchanges.
At a static price of $1000 per bitcoin Bill Gates could buy 4 million bitcoins with only 4.4% of his wealth.
We will never see bitcoin at $1000 dollars again.

Why exactly don't they get an expert like Andreas Antonopoulos answering questions at these hearings?

These dips are always great to get rid of the weak hands.

Regulations that limits bitcoins use cases = mostly bad
Regulations towards crypto exchanges, ICOs = good

Maybe one day they will learn.

To store all the bitcoin, need lots of room for that.

If you look at the supply of stable coins it's clear that a lot of money is going into the market atm. Just look at how much stable coins supply has increased in less than a month (April 24 -&gt; May 17)
PAX:  $104M -&gt; $182M
TUSD: $200M -&gt; $243M
USDC: $252M -&gt; $359M
