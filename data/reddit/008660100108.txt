QuadrigaCX has a few options besides BTC. LTC, BCH, ETH, BTG all have reasonable fees

Why couldn't the mining protocol simply be changed to include our selectively mine low-fee transactions? I never understood this and am having trouble finding an answer

Actually, I meant Atlantic.. xD
Still asleep aparently!

This doesn't really explain anything. Yes, you get fees if you win a block, but the fees come from transactions to fill the block. Regardless of who has the mining equipment, the software they run ultimately governs how they run. Why couldn't the software be changed to allow for selectively mining for low-fee transactions?

If I understand you correctly, miners already have the ability to include low-fee txs in their blocks? This is not an automated thing like I imagine?
Profitability aside, as an average user I wouldn't mind running my everyday hardware mining in a pool if it meant helping things run more smoothly. With regards to it being wise? Well, I'm no prophet but I'm sure a good portion of miners would continue to run with profit in mind.

Yeah, I agree now my idea is completely illogical. Eventually, nobody would be paying fees and block reward would be nil. Not to mention the spam issue.
Sometimes it takes a second set of eyes to see how rediculous you look, thanks for the solid criticism!

Looks to me you need to click that button to fix it

I do like the current logo, but it doesn't flow well when writing it by hand.
