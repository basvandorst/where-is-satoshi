Good - now you know where to drop them. I am sure that you can do it for free.

No. The fee size have no info.

GDAX is a exchange service. Costumer transfer eg. BTC or USD to GDAX and then exchange coins with other costumer. Coinbase account is integrated and it is free to transfer to/from your GDAX account and your Coinbase account. Withdraw funds is easy eg. to you bank or to BTC address. You can buy or sell any amount of BTC.
Live demo: 
It is possible to exchange for free (0 %)  
Limit order is the free way.  
But you bank take fee for transfer to GDAX.

Never underestimate the competitor because then you lose very fast.
bcash advantage:
- stolen brand
- stolen costumer by airdropping
- a Bitcoin celebrity that fight bitcoin and brand bcash + another celebrity (John McAfee‏) that brand bcash.
- provide low fee now
If you want to win the game then you have to play today.
Look at the trading price.

You can try not to play but the game go on even if you turn of the screen. There is no "Save game" or "Pause" button. 
If we was say [YES2X] instead of [NO2X] or Yes to 1½MB then bcash was even more pointless then it is now.
bcash also have that advantage that they don't fear HF as most as Bitcoin.
At the moment they can use love fee as sales trick combined with the stolen costumer by airdropping. bcash, low fee, for the pure etc.
To prevent that it is a strategically smart decisions to make a block size extension just because it take the argument out of bcash.
Fee like 450$, 25%, give bcash a undeservedly point.
Here is a user, ready to find another solution, I guess.
"just paid $17 of bitcoin to secure a  ID, paid $5 in network fees. first time experiencing 30%+ tsxn fees."
BTG add premining that bring them in a potential position so they can try to steal BitcoinDev.

For Android I Export Myceliums xpub or xprv to Electrum. It works. But then Electrum don't produce SegWit address. That need a completely new created SegWit wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:42:00
Yes. But Litecoin have 2MB 4 time every 10 minute = 8 MB, SegWit and LN.
It is must cheaper to keep the costumer then to lose them and then get them back again.
 
Any "chain shift" from Bitcoin will create a huge lose to users only because they on that nigh was not fast enough to get first to the exchange. It will be anti branding for crypto currencies, if a "chain shift" can happen one time then it can happen again.
The very new situation is a the trading price for that alt coin.
Bitcoin only as a store of value is a narrative. Any coin can store value but if Bitcoin fail then the crypto currency revolution is over and will not happen.

Have you try to ask them?
The best place to ask is "them". Asking you self or a mirror of you self if not effective.
It is not only bigger block as I understand: 
after asking them.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:34:50
Maybe  [NO2X] and wallet that have delayed segwit can  make some BTC tx with 5 BTC in fee so some miners come back.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:47:10
Do you say that I pump bcash? I can quarantine you that I don't pump bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:44:42
But maybe [NO2X] was a strategic mistake that bcash benefit of. What if bcash go to 4000 usd, where go hash power, dev team? I think we need at solution as a damage control. bcash is traded at as high as 1620. We have to focus on the users need in sort term also - and long term. The competition is strong.
I am big fan of "Andreas Antonpoulos on scaling and how the﻿ obvious solution to scaling is not always the right one.". LN, SegWit etc. 
Mycelium do not replay on request for SegWit implementation.
It look as they refuse to implement SegWit.
Fee of 450 USD worry.
I don't think the users like it = power to bcash.
SegWit Adaptation is 12% and is not increasing.
If bcash go to a trading price next to 50% of Bitcoin will we then be able to keep Bitcoin as the King? The costumers is the king over the King. Not the correct idea and plan. If the user want low fee now then we need to meet that request now, not because we like it but because we like to keep Bitcoin as the king before it is to late.
The very new situation is the record high trading price for a alt coin. We need a reaction.

There is not 100 000 club members. There is only 9749.
I have see a html pages that display 100 000 nodes out of the blue air, but I don't believe it.
10 000 nodes is already low and make the network weak, it is not too low but we need to ensure that also new nodes want to joind the network. I take 3 days to dl the block chain.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:32:57
Can you prove that it just is a pump and dump?
I see many copy paste that statement, but no prove.
It is too easy to say that the reason users run to the new shop is a temporary bug. Many shops have lose the game on that sleeping pillow.
Try to calculate (trading price * volume) what the "pump and dump" cost.
It is not a pump and dump. It is to expensive.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:07:16
and * pi = 565,5 %
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:39:33
Or don't count LN tx to the block size and a fixed LN tx fee.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:42:25
Again, manginahunter It must be a replay like yours "pump and dump eh ?"
Do you have calculated what a spam of the block chain cost?
It is easy to say that "some" spam the block chain but hard to prove and it is expensive to spam the mempool and therefore speculative to say.

Here is data:
It show that we have a problem because we like to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:19:43
Even if Bitcoin is not a company, and has no customers then the same roles apply for a system and users. And that is the point. 
Try to simulate a situation where everybody move from one coin to another coin. Few will get many more coin to a lower price because they was first to realise the new situation.
Very few will get the same amount of coin and many will lose coin or drop out.
That movement will create a lot of dissatisfied users. So that's not a way i would recommend.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:55:54
I agree. But look at the trading price. 
And look at the Bitcoin fee. 
Eg 
Some time Bitcoin is only for rich. We make anti bitcoin branding and have to addressed this issue if we want to keep bitcoin as the King. I do.
But at the same time nobody use bcash, yet.
bcash implement bech32 next year.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:15:11

I have noted that funny spike.
It is not 10x but 4x?
2017-11-10 0400 ~ 700
2017-11-12 0600 ~ 2800
700 * 4 = 2800.
It looks more as a fad finger. And maybe it was Roger. The days after he was more aggressive the normal. 
Who and why will lose ~ 25k BTC for that PND stunt?
What he get is bcash holders out as bcash holders and over to Bitcoin and lose 25 k BTC. I think he like more bcash holderes.

I normal pay 1 sat/B when I move to exchange. Sometime 10 minute, sometime 1 week.
If some have spamed the mempool with 60 MB ~ 5 sat/B they have to pay 3 BTC. Only miners that in that way pay to them self will do that. But whay are they only make that trick on Bitcoin and not on bcash?
I think that the high level in mempool is because Bitcoin is used.

Nice. SegWit is important. Way is the wallet not listed her: 
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:39:27
It depend on what you mean with convert?
You don't have a segwit wallet but a wallet that support segwit and legacy non segwit tx.
The wallet.dat file is not needed to be converted.
When you make tx from legacy address to segwit address you bitcoin is "converted" to segwit bitcoin. The next tx, segwit to segwit adr use fewer byte.

@_date: 2017-09-24 00:32:55
Is it? I think that the tx will not be relayed from node to node if fee is under 1 sat/B.
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:31:50
If you steal then you end up having something you don't have before.
After HF without replay protection only the receiver can access BTC(1) and BTC(2). And the receiver is not only the NYA 2x supporter. It is also 1X supporter.
Why is it not 1X that "steal"? There is agreement, 80% is agree 2X. And then a small group continue 1X and don't short down 1X according to the agreement.
Who is the thief? How can bitcoin innovate when agreement is ignored?

100,000+ if for sure wrong.
No info on how they have found nodes. Only a list with numbers.
Maybe that home page count all wallet client as nodes.

782 Bitcoin ABC nodes

Bitcoin is 10000 hard drives/nodes and tons of miner equipment. That is very physical. And the same is mathematics.
