We didn't rise from 6k to 7k
We did from 3k to 4k several times that implies demand at 3k.
But yeah who knows what happens its a lottery that's just the reason I think we bottomed.

True that but still took years for the libor manipulation to be detected.

Smaller blocks are more secure. Bigger blocks also mean less reward for miners when I'm not wrong.
If I'm wrong please correct me so I can learn better.

there is always a seller and a buyer in a future contract lol

then you don't really know what futures are I guess.
Futures are very important. Without them our economy can't run. I like futures because I can fix my price today for bitcoin I need in the future. Or I can fix my price to sell in the future. This offers a lot more strategic investment decisions and is helping to discover a truer price and manipulation is less easy to do.

Well got called delusional for holding by all these,"pro traders"
Seems like holding through and dca in 2018 makes pretty good profits.
Was so fun when people called for 2k at 3k and got mad when I said seems like we hit bottom.

It is not
futures were useful for me already
I traded inverse futures on kraken and could make a nice profit with my existing stack while we hovered at 3k without needing to buy with additional fiat.
Just because you can't see any value in them doesn't make it bad.
It is very useful to fix the price in advance.
Futures also help to avoid bubble building because you can short an asset.
If this burned you then this was your investment failure and not the futures fault.

it's normal that prices go up and down
can't understand why everyone crys and blames future contracts for something normal like a decrease in price?
If you are so sure it's manipulated or it will go down then just short it urself and be happy with it.

it baffles me at times how many people hate on every day derivates when it comes to bitcoin. especially if they don't even understand it

Well you can buy and then send them to the ledger? I feel quite comfortable using exchanges from my own country in case there is any problem.

Oh dude you are not from Europe are you? Things are quite fine still. We in Europe only worry about trump fking the world up.
The EU is nowhere close to collapse. The US economy is only good for the rich. The US is close to default  soon. University debts and the government are having too much dept. If a recession hits the US they are way more fked than Europe.

I'm pretty sure they can increase this with demand.

could be very possible. New eu minister for digitalization is verstager and she is in the same Party in the European Parlament as macrons party. Would love this change for my country.
