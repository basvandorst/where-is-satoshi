I think maybe we hit the 20k ceiling because it was too far and too fast a deviation from its baseline double exponential growth:   Double exponential is itself extraordinary - we should expect correction when it runs away much faster than that.

This is a nice bit of work, but it would be much better if it recognized the phenomenon as Bayesian rather than Markov. Each price movement is obviously correlated to previous movements and on distinct scales of periodicity, otherwise technical traders would be faring no better than monkeys. Xoel Lopez Barat, contact me if you're reading this, and let's take it to the next level.

Would you mind sharing a link to an application of Metcalf that shows how it pegs value to current number of users? I know Metcalf says value is proportional to users squared, but how does one determine the constant of proportionality to make an absolute prediction?  Thanks.

It went way more than parabolic; it outran double exponential:

Renewing my router's DHCP lease from my ISP seems to have cleared this error for me, which started appearing in all my browsers last evening.

If your router is a DHCP client to you ISP, try renewing it's lease. Worked for me!
