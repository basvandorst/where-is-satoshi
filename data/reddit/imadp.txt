Why would you ever risk it?
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:01:41
You gambled and lost. You can cut your losses now or keep gambling.

Thanks thats entirely useful

If you are only interacting with bitcoins through a bootable OS, does it matter whether that OS is connected to the internet or not? How can it be infected if only the bitcoin client is used (barring hardware keyloggers)?

Being a rational man and believing in an eternal afterlife is a contradiction.

A sea monkey kit is $20. Who cares how much his kit costs, its the same concept.
Now you are trying to tell me that kicking a ball 100 times is proof that everything has a cause, therefore god exists, therefore the afterlife exists. That is completely and utterly irrational line of thought, that no rational man would have. Just for fun, I'll refute your point anyway.
First off, there are processes in the world without cause. Do me a favor and take a look at a group of atoms and predict which one will radioactively decay first. It is impossible because: Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay. [Radioactive Decay](
Secondly, even if there was proof that God existed, what does that have to do with the afterlife? How do you rationally go from 'God exists' to 'Human beings on planet Earth will have eternal life after death'. There is no possible rational connection between those two things.

Thanks again for the information. So it seems that cold storage with an offline computer, used correctly, is one of the safest courses of action. 
Its probably overkill for someone who just wants to use casual transactions, in that case would you agree that a bootable linux usb with electrum offers reasonable protection for the equivalent of a 'checking' bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:20:09
Electrum sounds like a solution to the block size problem, but is electrum in itself another security risk?

No, I can't say that there must be a First Cause because its possible that some things can exist without a beginning. Just like you would say that God existed without a beginning. But its more rational to leave out God and just say that the universe existed without a beginning, because we have proof of the universe, and no proof of God.

Thanks for the information - so Armory is a solution that lets one of your online computers sync with the blockchain and Electrum is a solution that lets another server sync with the blockchain, if I'm understanding that correctly?
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:39:20
Don't you understand that we are both saying the same thing? We both believe that something can exist without a cause. You believe that God can exist without a cause, I believe that the universe can exist without a cause. The only difference is that your explanation requires a supernatural being which has not been proven to exist, and mine does not. Just keep it simple!

Another question I had - do you need to download the entire blockchain to make a transaction? If so a 4gb usb drive isn't going to be big enough.. Is it possible to make a transaction without downloading the whole chain?

A rational man could of course deduce an afterlife if there was evidence proving it, but there is none so it is simply an irrational belief. And no, the bible or any other of the hundreds of 'holy' books are not evidence, and neither is blind faith.
A man freezing his body may be hoping for eternal or extended life, but being frozen and rethawed is surely not the afterlife you were talking about. No one thinks sea monkeys are living in the afterlife after they are thawed out from a $20 kit at a toy store.

$300 to $1, just like the real spartans!
