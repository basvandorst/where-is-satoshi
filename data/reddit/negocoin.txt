Please check out  a new virtual currency classifieds website. Any input or feedback is greatly appreciated!
Note: The website is in early development phases so some links may not function properly yet.

I've just launched my virtual currency classifieds website. I want people to register and start selling/buying goods and services using the most popular virtual currencies Bitcoin, Litecoin and Namecoin. In order to generate interest I'm giving away free Bitcoins to qualifying members. 
To qualify you need to be one of the first 100 people to register and submit an appropriate ad. Then send a message via the contact page with your Bitcoin address and once we receive the message you should get your coins within a few hours!
Please help my site get started! :)

aminok is correct it's 5µBTC, but im glad your're happy nonetheless dalessandrew.
I'm not rich but I'll still give free bitcoins to random people on the internet if they join/use my new classifieds site.

Please make sure to put your ad link and bitcoin address when sending me the message or I don't know where to send the bitcoins!

I guess I would say it's pronounced negg-o. It's short for negotiable or negotiation.
