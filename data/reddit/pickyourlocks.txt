Does it have a physical keypad? The keys that get pressed will show usage more than the other keys narrowing down the possibilities. I'm sure there are other dangerous side channel attacks too.
I personally prefer to store my cold keys on several metal plates stored around the world with family members.

I think Sanders is the best candidate for libertarians who care about social issues (Immigration, Drug war, etc). 
If your prioritize anarchist capitalism not so much but not all Bitcoin holders agree we should let corporations have unregulated control over the planet. I'm personally somewhere between a libertarian and socialist because I believe checks/balance on power are needed, especially on multinational corporate power. 
Roger Ver is just being his typical dickish self, he should also offer more too if he actually wants this to be anything more than public masturbation, 100K is not very much money.

Given Ethereum is not scalable in its current state and that scaling it would require possibly sharding the blockchain which is completely uncharted territory and possibly won't work, you would assume that would have so much counter party risk and that would make investors skeptical :)

People can understand it has a lot of potential so they are speculating on future value based on unknown but expected advancements in its ability to be a platform for distributed applications. Unfortunately speculating on future unknown events causing massive price spikes is the definition of a bubble.
I get it being worth a few dollars but right now the ecosystem is not very mature and there are very few use cases and most people I talk to on reddit seem to have a gross misunderstanding of the project and its use cases.
@_date: 2016-03-24 18:24:52
It is a very interesting experiment, scaling it and moving to proof of stake will be difficult/dangerous since there are so many levels of complexity being added so it will be interesting to see how it turns out.

Any serious service should be operating their own explorer for internal use.

They are not worried it can be used against "them" (as in the core developers), they are afraid this opens up a potential attack surface to be used against everyone running a bitcoin full node.

I think his point was that decentralization is a minor feature that does not really add much over the existing "prediction markets". 
This was clearly someone just trying to advertise in a thread where someone was trying to provide actual help, its a dickish move at best.

And is each client going to come with a default list? Who gets to define the default list because almost no one will change it from that default.
Also who is going to manage this and build it and then test it? If you want to build the code out and issue a pull request everyone will review it.

You listed several things Ethereum uses and they have had a mining pool with enough capacity to do a 51% attack for 3 weeks+ while the entire community has sat on their hands and done nothing but continue to pump the price. So these are not panacea solutions.

Vlad's argument can be found here: 
It would be nice to see counter points if there are any.

As more stake holders come onboard the decision process will be slower that is natural for decentralized and democratic systems. If you want maximize efficiency of decision making there are plenty of projects ran by a single Foundation that has 100% authority over the protocol.
These issues even occur with http and web standards, there has to be a period where the power is broken up and groups have to work together and independently for change.

Forks will follow one blockchain or another, it would be difficult to "lose" coins.
@_date: 2016-03-21 13:09:36
I agree about alt currencies but I would avoid conflating value with success, many bubbles in the past have lasted this long before suddenly popping.
Ethereum has major scalability issues and is has been vulnerable to a 51% attack for almost 3+ weeks while the community sits on their hands and are doing nothing to try to fix it. Instead much of the community including recently hired developers have been more focused on continuing to pump the price.
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:39:01
Vlad has said it himself in many interviews and many times on reddit. Just look at his account in the past few days. 
In its current form its not scalable, there or proposals but there are not fully working examples of how to scale the system. 
Also blockchain bloat is a massive issue already and its not being used. 
I think its a powerful platform but obviously its being overblown to pump the price.

A few users having exclusive control over a messaging system is centralization of that aspect of the system.

First this was all from memory so it may have typos or minor mistakes but it should help guide you towards the right direction. If it was from the git repository, go into the git repo. Then use git status to see if you have any uncommitted files. If you do reset it
    cd ~/bitcoin-source/
    git status 
    git reset --hard HEAD
    git pull origin master
After that you will have the newest source, you may need to shift the branch so you are not using the development branch. 
     git status
The very first line informs you which branch you are on. If you need to switch it is easy:
    git branch *somethinghere*
Then everything is ready to compile. I don't remember the exact process but I'm prety sure its similar too:
    cd src/
    make -f linuxmakefile.make
   
Then it will compile to the src folder if you have the required dependences and you are ready to execute it. 
    ./bitcoind
Good luck.

Seems a bit paranoid but it is annoying seeing a group of people failing to understand their system and yet it seems to constantly have millions flooding in. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 16:40:19
Its more likely they will use their lack of understanding to their advantage.

They are using webkit for their client and their future browser. its not very secure obviously.
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:59:08
Seems reasonable.

Why does your sentence end with a !
If you are going to make claims you should back it up with at least 1 reason. Stating things without any evidence on the internet is literally a waste of time, you are not convincing me of your point of view you are just ensuring others know you have a point of view, which we will not care and forget about if you don't try to support it.
I was young but I remember a time when Netscape was the only browser essentially. It was a good thing when more browsers were released, it allowed for different groups to allow their browsers to be a test bed for features they felt were important. 
We should just accept people will create clients we may not agree with, if they deviate too far from the other clients then like IE6 it won't work and no one will use it. If it is usable then its fair game.

Smart contracts are not unique to Ethereum, you can find references of them on the cypherpunk list dating back over a decade. Bitcoin has had a simple scripting language since the start. 
It is frustrating since most people are ignorant of how Bitcoin and cryptocurrency work claim that Ethereum is the only coin with smart contracts or that you need Ethereum to make decentralized applications.

I don't think it would be a government take over, I think a financial take over by wealthy private industry who want to change the rules to better suite their needs is more realistic.
It is pretty obvious that plutocrats have more power than governments anyways with the exception of some countries.

No private companies can kidnap people, kill union organizers, poison drinking water, dump waste in oceans and so much more. They also use their ability to move international to avoid taxes and punishment.

Well the problem was the ETH foundation promoted investment leading to 17% or 150 million dollars to be invested into a single contract. The first attempted use of this contract ever. Well it was coded very badly and the foundation even lost lots of money. So they have been using the Foundation money to try to recover it.
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:22:37
I generally agree. I see the government more as a tool to create change. Unfortunately this tool is almost completely controlled by corporate power that has grew past the concept of nationalism decades ago.

I remember when it was posted, I was just as stressed out so it was funny. I had just left the US for the first time (never been back since) and had no wealth in banks after a new account I created was closed without any warning because I bought tickets to a security conference abroad. It has been a wild 6 years.

I disagre, it is wasteful and it would be great to have a better solution. The technology will evolve and we may in the future be able to improve it but until one is proven to be better without adding additional risk its not worth changing because the value of Bitcoin is too great.
Its like building solar panels, its expensive, costs  lots of energy and we will upgrade as technology advances but we need to keep building solar panels regardless of the costs because of the benefits.
@_date: 2016-06-22 09:40:42
Its about maintaining the balance of power between miners, holders and developers. If any one group gets too much power the others should react to check their power. 
Also everyone needs to be clear that this is like freedom of speech, you have to put up with hearing things you don't like or in the case of cryptocurrency you have to put up with some circumstances you don't like to ensure freedom for everyone now and in the future.

Thanks for the details, does the CSV change also make it even easier to implement a decenralized exchange? I know they exist but obviously improvements could theoretically be made.
@_date: 2016-06-22 07:58:41
Why can't we exist in a community where we see alternative wallet choice as a good thing? The more competing wallets means the development processed is less centralized and harder to compromise.

just read this the etc dev lays it all out and answers questions - he is clearly much smarter than most eth devs - including vitalik
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:21:27
it does not only affect ETC, it affects both chains, and the problem doesnt exist once you split - thinking otherwise shows you dont know what you are talking about
ETH developers fucked up, have issues because their big contracts created before the HF have both coins on them so they are the most affected and now want etc to hard fork to fix their shit which wont happen
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:46:52
They did respond, directly. They told VItalk directly to do a proper hard fork and fix your own shit, its ETH problem because they failed to do it right
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:50:51
What if they were so confident they didn't split ETH/ETC and fucked themselves
@_date: 2016-07-26 21:31:20
what is funny is the dev for etc told them about this before it fucking happened - they ignored him then and now are fucked because they have to hf again because trying to convince the etc dev to hf for their fuckup wont get much tracktion
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:47:44
Thats not true at all
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:24:47
you got it, it affects both and if you pick just one its not a issue at all
eth forkers are delusional and think everyone will want to use eth only or eth + etc but not only etc which is fucking stupid. who wants to use a shitty coin controlled by a bunch of privileged immature kids who constantly lie
