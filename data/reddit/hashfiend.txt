Bitstamp said their bitcoind wallet has been showing inconsistent results. That points to a faulty implementation of the wallet software that many other wallet implementations are based on.
I'm not very happy with Gox ($10k in cash withdrawls pending for weeks) but in this case it appears that they were correct (or mostly correct) in their statements.

If he has been under a gov't gag order and unable to defend himself or talk about what has happened then I can't begin to fathom the stress he would have been under for the past weeks or months.

It wouldn't be the first time the US gov't has pulled something like this so it's not really a stretch to imagine it happening here.

14000 BTC is "chump change" to only a tiny fraction of a fraction of a percent of the global population.
For example, there are about 200,000 "Ultra High Net Worth" (UHNW) individuals in the world -- less than 0.003% of global population. UHNW = Net worth of at least $30m. I don't think someone with $30m, or even $100m, would consider a loss of $8.7m to be "chump change".
You need to get into the billionaire club before losing $8.7 million isn't going to hurt. Forbes says that in 2014 there are 1645 billionaires in the world, 0.0000235% of the global population.
So, I don't think you will find too many people who would consider losing 14000BTC to be "chump change".
14BTC on the other hand really should not be something to kill yourself over for anyone in the western world who is wealthy enough to have a computer, Internet connection, and have the luxury of being on Reddit.

From the Bitstamp notice, "Bitstamp’s exchange software is extremely cautious concerning Bitcoin transactions. Currently it has suspended processing Bitcoin withdrawals due to inconsistent results reported by our bitcoind wallet"
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:14:07
I can see how you could interpret it that way but to me a more direct interpretation is that the bitcoind wallet is not reporting correct results. Perhaps they will clarify it with a followup post.

I'm not sure if you replied to the wrong person or if you just don't know what [security through obscurity]( is. Trying to keep things secure by hiding them is a losing proposition.
Also, in this case I think Gox was damned if they did and damned if they didn't. If they didn't release details on the problem many people would have been at their throats saying they were trying to hide things or that they were being dishonest. Now that it seems they did describe the problem in a fairly accurate way people are pissed that they did this too.
Personally I'm not happy with Gox's overall shitty service and horrible performance. I have $10k in pending withdrawals and I could *really* use that money. However pointing fingers at them for what does seem to be a legitimate issue doesn't help anyone.

There is far too much information to write out in a Reddit post. I'm also not your teacher or your mother, I have no responsibility to train or educate you. That said:
It took 6 years for [Nicholas Merrill]( to have his gag order lifted so he could even speak about what happened to him.
[Ladar Levison]( shut down his 9 year old company with over 400,000 users rather than get dragged into the same sort of never ending bullshit that Karpeles seems to have been dragged into.
[Phil Zimmermann]( spent three years fighting the US government over the export of PGP, something he had nothing to do with directly. He was the easiest target however so that's who got govfucked.
If you're American you should be ashamed of your country. If you're not American you should be very cautious of dealing with anything related to the US, especially anything online.

Arbitrage is not the goal.
I have some suppliers who are willing to take BTC payments but of course they need to convert that money back into fiat on their end as that is what they still need to work with.
While there is always some risk with such high volatility I think it is still possible to use BTC for remittances like this as long as one is in and out of the market in a reasonably short period of time. Four days is definitely too long.
@_date: 2013-05-31 09:05:14
The issue is that more and more governments are likely to do the same things. Having exchanges in developed countries is going to become a lot harder over the next few years, something I have said many times already. Taking down bitcoin is of course impossible. Making it a *lot* harder to move BTC to/from fiat is fairly trivial in comparison.

No, not the same thing at all. One saves you money, the other wins you a prison sentence and/or a very large fine. Even if someone does not like the current tax system (I don't) they would be a fool to not use it to their best advantage within the law.


If you read the post again you will see that my purpose is to move money between countries to make payments. The desire is to increase the speed of these payments so that I can make better use of my available business capital. This sort of thing is a perfect use of BTC and also helps provide liquidity to the BTC marketplace. My amounts are relatively small ($100,000 is *nothing* when it comes to finance) but more people doing this sort of thing would be very, very good for BTC.

What kinds of wars?
If you're talking *real* war I give you Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and any number of other insanely wealthy people of power. Though not billionaires themselves we could add Bush and Obama to this list as well. Both are exceedingly wealthy, will get more-so over time, and both waged wars for much of their presidencies.
If you're talking war in a more general sense there are even more examples. Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, just to name a few that are known to most everyone. All of these guys view(ed) business as war and regularly (or constantly) waged war on competitors.
If you wish to be a bit more historical about it pretty much *only* the wealthy started and waged wars.

If you really think that's how businesses conduct their affairs you are either very young or just really naive. Industrial espionage, monopolistic practices, predatory hiring, patent litigation, product dumping, and this is only scratching the surface. There's a reason a higher percentage of top corporate managers have psychopathic tendencies.


War is *insanely* profitable in capitalistic societies. The US spends hundreds of billions of dollars on war and "defense", much of which goes to private contractors. It's by *far* the largest part of the US budget.

The minimum wage in China is about US$200 per month overall. Much lower in some places, somewhat higher in others. That's the wage for people who actually have jobs, there are many, many people who live on less. Huge numbers of people using BTC is really not that big a deal if they each only use a *tiny* amount each month.
I've seen a lot of people who clearly know very little about China, Chinese people, and Chinese business culture who have speculated about how important China is to BTC, and BTC to China. BTC was a fad in China, like many fads before and many fads yet to come. The government has spoken, the fad has passed, and it will be much more difficult to re-introduce it now. In many ways (to the average Chinese citizen) BTC was the Chinese version of the US "Beanie Baby" insanity.
As is nearly always the case in China, a few people will have made a humongous amount of money from this fad and most everyone else will have gotten screwed to some degree or other.

Zero Hedge is not exactly the best source of information.
As for the currency or not debate, I'm happy to accept BTC as a currency. The Japanese government however appears to not yet believe it is and this is to our advantage. If/when they do start to consider it a currency the same strict banking laws applied to fiat transactions in Japan will also be applied to BTC. Since it is nearly impossible to do this they will likely consider it a tool of money launderers and that will create some pretty big (perhaps insurmountable) problems for Gox and anyone else in Japan working with BTC.

Any suggestions for a real exchange in the US?
A big part of the reason for doing this was to avoid the time involved in international wire transfers. If I have to send the money overseas to buy coins I may as well just send it directly to the supplier and avoid any potential volatility in BTC.

This is why speed is important. The idea is to hop into BTC on one exchange and then hop back to fiat on another exchange within an hour or two, faster if possible. (I don't mind paying some transaction fees to speed the transfer.)
Currently some transfers by the banking system can take up to a week to process and confirm. The benefit of reducing a week to a few hours would be very big. Big enough to accept the volatility risks of BTC over the period of a couple of hours.

Level 2 verification at Coinbase allows buying up to 50BTC per day which would be fine for my current situation.

Raw population numbers don't tell the story here. Something around 80% of China's population lives in pretty extreme poverty. China's GDP has only just recently surpassed that of Japan's even though China has 10x the population. A large amount of China's GDP is based around manufacturing for export rather than internal consumer demand.
The wealth in China is very, very concentrated and I think the importance of China to BTC at the current time has been very much overstated.

Gox is a Japanese company and the banking laws in Japan are *really* strict. I'm actually surprised they have managed to survive in the Japanese regulatory environment TBH.
The reason that verification wasn't required for amounts up to ~$1000 before is that by Japanese law you can do a cash transfer of up to 100,000yen (~$1k) without having to verify who you are. Anything over that amount and you must either tie the transfer to a bank account or you must provide government ID that will be copied and kept on file. 
I'm not sure why Gox has started requiring verification for fiat transfers on all accounts. However if I had to guess it would be that the regulators and/or tax authorities have started asking questions about all the money flowing in and out of Gox bank accounts and exactly where that money is moving to/from. In many cases Gox won't have been able to provide concrete answers with ID to back them up and that likely lead to some pretty uncomfortable conversations. As such they are now requiring verification.
That they do not require verification for BTC transfers is also interesting. This means that at the current time the Japanese government does not consider BTC to be a currency.
