My point was that the level of fractional computation for the average person is more difficult than they typically have to do today. 
As to America bashing, it's not about bashing Americans on the whole, but rather our ability to handle the math. It's not something that the average Joe wants to do and I am pretty confident there is data out there on the math aptitude of Americans and their willingness to accept change (no pun intended). 
The larger point becomes whether enough American will be willing to do the work and adopt it. I do like the comments I've seen though, that point out it can be a transactional offering on the backend while exposing people to the bitcoin "brand" and making them more likely to adopt their habits to it.

Um, yeah, that's a valid apples to apples comparison...

A lot of validity in that, but just because it is the current top brand in these currencies doesn't mean it will survive low adoption rates nor that something less capable will take over the spot.

I agree tools can solve the problem, the question becomes whether people will understand the value and all the other technical issues in order to actually use it.

People don't care about fractional gallons, because there is nothing for them to calculate. They either buy to $20 and the machine stops automatically or they fill their tank completely.  The issue isn't 2 decimal points, it's 8 and it's being able to do the computations required to figure things out in their heads, understanding what each decimal point represents, and remembering it all and understanding that the values of those decimal points are constantly changing in relation to the US dollar that they are used to and understand.

Well, that might be a possible solution to the "stupid" problem, but it still requires a method of translation to US dollars until it is the defacto or at least a widely accepted currency.
I really like the idea of it being transparent to the user in the currency they are used to at the beginning stages, but in order for it to accomplish what I believe are the goals of the community, then it needs to become more to the average person.
