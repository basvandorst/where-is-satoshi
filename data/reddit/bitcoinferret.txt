What? Working backwards from a 9000% ROI gives a starting price of around $140, which is the price in 2013 - where CMC's records begin
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:39:08
I don't know. I just saw it tick over from 8,999%. True ROI is of course infinite
@_date: 2019-07-09 12:00:01
Closest I can get to a true ROI is around 1.4 billion percent, based on the first ever dollar:bitcoin trade in October 2009

I think that will happen in the next couple of days.
You're talking about the market cap, right?

I got my coin out of Trezor using the beta wallet and the coin splitting tool.  Doesn't let you hold BCH in Trezor, but does let you send off the BCH to any BCH address.  I sent mine straight to ViaBTC last night and traded the lot immediately for BTC.  Worked fine - just waiting for a few more confirmations.  Fuck Bitcoin Cash!

Cool, yeah, just follow this guide:

Bitcoin, you are welcome to stay on vacation for as long as you like. Enjoy yourself.  I have just freed up a load of my time to re-engage with what's going with Bitcoin development and it's so nice to come back to this sub to find articles about Lightning, Taproot etc Big difference from January when I last had time to lurk.

Because the fucker goes home to his fucking wife and tells her that some fucker just paid him in Bitcoin to fix his fucking crapper.  Said fucking wife goes out for wine and fucking olives with her mates and tells them about it and one of them decides she's going to start taking Bitcoin for her fucking legal services.
Result: at least three more fuckers in the ecosystem, more upward pressure on the BTC price for all us greedy fuckers and no fucking fiat!
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:05:18
I couldn't disagree more.  At the moment it's an asset, yes, but only because it has the potential to be so much more.
I will pay for my coffee with BTC when the scalability issues are solved and when all fiat currency becomes obsolete, which I see as inevitable.
I'm saying that instead of patting ourselves on the back for making hypothetical gains on an asset, and stressing about selling at the top, we prepare for the future by figuring out how to do peer-to-peer economics safely and fairly.

You're right about Gresham's Law and that is what is happening now.  Why would you spend Bitcoin when you can ditch some zombie money?
However I think that Bitcoin is, has been and will always be a currency.  Unlike gold, it has no 'intrinsic' value.  Its value comes from its ability (and its potential) to act as a trustable medium of exchange, now or in the future. It's certainly behaving like an asset at the moment, though, I agree.

I have mixed feelings about those credit cards.  They mean that you are disposing of some of your BTC without bringing any new players into the game.  The coffee shop is completely unaware that you funded the card with BTC; it's just another card transaction for them.  The worst part is that you don't get to keep any gains between funding the card and spending, the card provider does.
What I'm proposing is going out of your way to pay people directly in Bitcoin: carpenters, wedding photographers, friends you owe money, presents for nieces and nephews etc.  If they don't have a wallet, help them set one up on their phone. If it's a decent amount of money then the fee isn't such a big deal.
I'm definitely not saying don't hodl for the gains but do this too! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:21:04
I sort of agree.  Don't piss it away because you think you're rich all of a sudden, and definitely keep on HODLing.  Just don't think the only route out is zombie money.
I don't need a mechanic because I live in a city and don't need to own a car.  I do own a toilet and I have zero interest in learning how to fix it.  Any plumbers want to earn some BTC?

My non-techie friends read this as:
Bumped to layer 3: Awesome! That means it's closer to being launched.
New layer 2: we got a new layer too!
My limited understanding after one skim-read is that minds (more powerful than mine) have been changed and we're further away from Lightning Network than we thought?
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:44:04
This. And also don't hold your coins on any exchange. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 06:46:24
I think this is an important point but, from what I understood, the 12-word seed is NOT compatible with other wallets.  However, it IS possible to take the seed yourself and (offline) derive access to a new wallet in a different client.  Please correct me if this is wrong.
@_date: 2017-04-13 13:32:46
What are the 'right' reasons?
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:38:49
First off, excellent guide! Definitely one of the most clearly presented and thoughtful technical how-tos I've ever read. Great work!
I followed the guide to the letter from the github version, which I think is more up-to-date than the Medium article now, and everything works fine. Got the Pi working as a server and synced the testnet blockchain but have got stuck trying to get bitcoin-cli to work.
When I type:
`bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`
I always get
`error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)`
I tried to follow another thread in which you investigate by logging in as user `pi` but I think this may now be out of sync with the github guide?  I seem to have now created multiple bitcoin.conf files and I don't know which one bitcoin-cli is trying to use. I am confused as to whether I should be running the line above as user `admin `pi or `bitcoin I have tried all three and always get the same result.
My sysadmin skills are very basic and I think I am missing something simple. Anyone else tried doing this recently getting the same problem? Thanks in advance for any help!

Hey, Stadicus has updated to the guide to fix this issue:
Just updated the guide today, see updates section:
In case it's something else, feel free to open an issue.

Is there a word yet for people who own (at least) one Bitcoin?  We're going to need one.  Oner, Onesie, Coiner, Unocoin :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:43:01
That's one way of looking at it

12:45 in the UK and watching blocks countdown to Segwit lock-in. 4 to go!
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:33:33
You're welcome.
I just checked back.  It's now over 4 hours since I requested the transaction from Coinbase and it's still showing as 'pending'.  At the other end, no sign of it, which probably means that they haven't submitted the transaction yet.  This is worrying.  It makes me wonder about their solvency.  Have they sold more Bitcoin than they hold?
On the plus side, couldn't ask for a clearer demonstration of how the Coinbase wallet is not really a wallet at all!
I can't see any reason not to try and remove all of your holding from Coinbase now.  What would you gain from doing a test transaction?
Anyway, I will keep an eye on it and post here as soon as anything changes.  It's 9.30 PM here so probably best to check back in about 12 hours for an update...
Update 2: Quick check before I went to bed and the transaction is now showing both ends with 2 confirmations - so I will sleep better
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:56:16
Update: I thought it would be helpful to make a screencast video of the process so went and bought some Bitcoin on Coinbase.  When I went to send it to my wallet, there was a worrying message:
Bitcoin Transaction Delays
We're currently working through a backlog of Bitcoin withdrawals. Recent or new outbound BTC transactions may remain pending longer than expected.
Anyone know how much longer than expected??
I guess if I end up losing this Bitcoin making a video showing people how to avoid losing their Bitcoin, I kind of deserve it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:15:55
Thanks.  That totally made my day!
Transfer go OK?
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:12:22
Don't let the best be the enemy of the good enough!  People will argue passionately about which is the best wallet.  For now, we're talking about finding a safe haven for your Bitcoin, so the fact that Breadwallet (deliberately) leaves out some features (like multisig transactions or custom transaction fees) in favour of simplicity doesn't really matter.
The important thing is that these modern mobile wallets, unlike web wallets like blockchain.info, connect you directly to the Bitcoin network.
If Breadwallet went under, they would probably just stop updating the open source code.  You could continue using the current version and someone would probably make a fully compatible replacement.
Worst case scenario, the app stops working, you can take the seed into another wallet (this is slightly trickier than it would be with other wallets as you would need to convert the seed but if it gets to that point I'm sure you'll find plenty of guidance on how to do it, here or elsewhere).
More on this in the comments thread of a previous post

Good luck!  Took a total of 5 hours so hopefully yours will be the same or quicker.

OP is right 100% as several others have already pointed out. You'd be surprised how many people think bitcoins are physical. And that you have to buy a whole one. Shitcoins cashed in on the latter because people thought they couldn't 'afford' bitcoin.

Instead of paper round or mowing lawns help old people buy bitcoin and take a small cut

Yes, that was a nice touch

I have one of those coins lying around at my place and a couple of people have picked it up and asked, in awe, 'is this what I think it is?'. Not friends exactly but functioning adults in my wider social circle!
