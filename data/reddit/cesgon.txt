I don't think so. Max can be a bit radical sometimes and even a clown but he is a entertainer as well. At the other hand, Andreas, is just Andreas...Don't wanna be a sucker. But after seeing his meet up presentation in L.A and the interview at JRE. he is just amazing and the way he understand Bitcoin as a platform as a whole... He should definitely do a TED.

I have the 7Gh/s and yes will stop. you need to connect it to via USB and control the hardware (BFL) with a mining software. For example,  I use bfgminer. So if you shut down your computer software and connection will stop working. :)

I'm not interested in going after him... I'm interested in Bitcoin becoming mainstream. I'm interested in Bitcoin change the world. Interested that from Kids to Gradmothers have their wallet and know how to use cold storage... I'm more interested in the real thing. 
If Dorian is the real Satoshi... Mate a big thank you and please keep living a peaceful life.

back psychology game.... He knew that we would know for fact that Satoshi Nakamoto was a the real name outside the matrix, hence he used his real name so we thought his pseudonym was another one... so at the end we were never going to for a Satoshi Nakamoto because we are in the Matrix so we going to look for another name. Hi mislead us completely thanks to Morpheus Newsweek to shows the way to the Real world.
