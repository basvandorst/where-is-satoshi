I use BlockChain wallet on iOS. Is this considered safe like Bread?
I don’t have a large enough understanding to know if their blog means I am safe or not.

I plan to invest more. I’d like to get a better idea and understanding of everything first, and test the waters so to speak before going in at too much volume
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:48:43
This is the type of answer I was looking for. This was meant to be more of an experiment to see how well I can predict, hence the small amount of money. If I do alright, roi is small, but if I’m terrible it’s a small loss
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:45:51
Yeah that’s sort of what I was getting at. $30 is an incredibly small roi, but then again, it’s $30 more dollars I can invest back in. Or would you just hodl the $200 longterm
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:41:03
That’s my plan. I will not trade or sell it regardless of what it does. I waste more than that a week on stupid stuff anyway. 
My concern is more that it’s not a big enough investment to ever see a reasonable return. But at this rate who knows what a decade or so could bring. 
I know with $200 in there even if it hit a million I’d only make about 30k. 
But hey what the hell. I’m down for a long term gamble
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:50:38
I just bought $200 usd worth of bitcoin. I’ve got .034 or so now. 
It’s really all I can comfortably afford to lose at the moment and I keep missing out while my friends around me make more and more money from larger investments. 
I’ve begun researching a lot. 
My question is, is this too small of an amount for me to just leave invested for a potential future earning, and if I can afford to lose it, is it enough that I should just leave it there and see what happens? Or is this small of an investment just a total waste of my time?
I know how insanely it has grown since inception, but did I already miss the boat on returns like that or are we looking at it potentially happening again over the next few years or decade?
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:06:05
Good advice. I did store my recovery words physically and locked them away. I also switch to using Bread on iOS. I like the interface better anyway. Glad I only tested transferring with very small amount to avoid fees. 
If my investment is enough to warrant the physical wallet I will some point soon. Right now it would cost almost half my total holdings lol
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:53:30
Maybe a dumb question but I was wondering this the their day when I set everything up. I got Bread all set up. Got my seed words and made sure they were in a safe place. 
But, what happens if Bread doesn’t exist anymore? Like let’s say I go look in, idk, 5 years and Bread development team is gone and the app isn’t available. Are the seed words any good anywhere else? Or am I SOL?
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:06:45
This is great info and much appreciated. So I started out using coin base. I’m working on getting something like Electrum wallet set up so that I can store my coins and move them around when I want. How would you say that Coinbase works as far as buying and selling in the dips and rises goes? Interface seems simple enough so I like it. 
Or should I check out bitfenix instead? Can I set up buy and sell rules?
Also, probably a dumb question, but I imagine I can easily send funds back and forth from my Coinbase address to the bitfenix address and vice versa?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:19:09
Firstly, I was completely wrong and it wasn’t Bitfenix, it was Bittrex. So totally my fault. Second, I’m new to the BTC world and more than likely am completely wrong or potentially not confident enough to tell the bullshit from the truth. So I definitely apologize for spreading false information. 
I did find the article I read today to clarify. [Bittrex Article]( 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:40:21
So basically, for $200 that I can afford to lose and potentially live without, I take a gamble that maybe someday it’s worth about $35k?
Doesn’t seem like a horrible idea then 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:06:56
Yes this is a lot of help. 
One other question I recently also bought myself a single LTC. Just to get my feet wet. Do I need to worry about moving LTC into a wallet before the BTC fork, or no it will be safe to leave in Coinbase for now?
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:10:16
Idk I’m a new guy. Recently bought my first bit. Planning to throw in $50 a paycheck and just hodl that shit. 
By the way I just learned “hodl” today haha. 
My goal is to have .1 bitcoin by the end of the year. Should be possible with my initial investment be a couple hundred bucks. 
Anyway long story short, I think you guys probably have a lot of new people. I’ve been following bitcoin trends on and off for a few months now, and obviously wish I got in sooner. 
Problem is I didn’t really understand it until just recently, and I do t invest in things I don’t understand. 
Now here’s to hoping I got in early enough still to make some big returns someday
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:11:37
Okay that is what I thought. I haven’t researched a ton on LiteCoin yet so do t want to invest too much yet. But I figured even if it somehow hits $100 at some point I’ve doubled my money lol
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:56:15
Excellent thank you. This is what I was hoping
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:53:31
It’s been bouncing up and down the last week a few hundred bucks. Bought the dip figuring I’d try for some small gains. 
Keeps just going lower lol. 
Time to HODL
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:39:40
Sorry I should have clarified a little. I meant more so a waste of time because of the low dollar amount of investment. I wasn’t sure if an amount low as let’s say, $200 was a waste of time to try playing dips and rises of only about $500 in BTC value
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:29:32
I’m actually interested in what you mean by trading?
I have a healthy 401k that I understand fairly well. That I have decided will not be touched as part of this experiment/venture. 
I am considering putting $50 every two weeks I get paid into more BTC, because again, what the hell. I waste $25 a week on far more frivolous shit. But is that too simple a strategy? Should I be looking for dips before I buy? Or if I am considering leaving it in long term does it not matter. Should I be trying to sell high and then rebuy low if a large drop appears to be happening? Is it usually obvious, or slow enough that I have time to react?
At this point, at the rate I would be buying I know I’ll never be a millionaire. But figure if I toss a few bucks in here and there, and keep an eye on things, maybe some day in a few years, or hell even a decade, maybe I can pay of my house haha
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:44:39
Yeh that makes sense. My question feels even dumber to myself now lol. It was more an ask based on others experience. 
If I may ask one more question, as Coinbase fees are high, the ROI would be tough for small dips and climbs. 
Am I correct in that GDAX either charges a very small, or no fee? I recently got logged into GDAX for the first time have begun exploring and reading up 
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:36:35
Any news on Bread Wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:40:22
I was just reading that people’s accounts have been frozen. And many when reaching out to Support to find out why they are frozen, then had their account banned. Their bitcoins lost. 
The entire article was explaining that some people had over 30k in bitcoin and had their account frozen or banned with no information provided as to why or when it will release
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:47:29
Just curious. Is there possibility of Litecoin or Ethereum going up significantly, even temporarily, just before the BTC fork? Is there merit in the idea that people may move their BTC into one of these altcoins as a means of surviving the fork? Or will most just leave them alone or tuck them away in a wallet until the dust settles
