they are the same company as far as I know. coinbase has less information but is easy to use. I think the ease of use if coinbase comes at a cost of higher fees 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:08:30
whats the context of this?
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:32:34

withdrawal to bank account. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:02:51
I'm not really sure where to start here.. 
Banks control  our money, which wouldn't bother me but they are involved in a lot of shady and manipulative practices. Taking the bank out of the equation and being able to do it this cheaply is a huge deal.
How long does it takes for an international bank transfer again vs a few minutes for bitcoin? 
Also the amount of people in the world that don't have banks may surprise you. No bank, no transfer. 
$10, 000 dollars is a small amount of money to a large amount of people. I'm sure you could look up amount of $10, 000 transactions per day internationally but I'm not gonna go there.
Simply enough, western union makes a killing in international transfers.

@_date: 2017-09-08 14:25:15
bitcoin is a method of transferring wealth not money.. just like USD. is USD worth a whole lot of money? yes.
@_date: 2017-09-19 13:47:43
$4100 even
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:36:18
yep, it will def fluctuate 400-1000. try to buy the dip. it's rare to pinpoint the exact bottom but you can come close. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:51:04
bank transfers can easily take 4 days especially since they don't operate on the weekends. wire transfers however are usually 1 day or less but there will be a fee attached. be patient and save a few bucks 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:11:43
what they mean is they are positive the price will rebound and selling is at waste of time and money. history shows the price always rebounding but we must keep in mind that history may not necessarily repeat itself. my advice is don't invest what you're not willing to lose and hodl. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:01:47
signal is my everyday sms/mms app. it's not restricted to Signal users like what's app. so if the end recipient doesn't have signal is sends as a normal text. it's one of the smoothest sms/mms apps out right now on top of being a open source, encrypted app

when i opened my coinbase account in 2014 they gave me .0097 BTC @ $5 for free. beat it.

I remember seeing this, idkw.. Anthony Bourdain? Random netflix movie about gutter kids? Slum dog millionaire? Fuck, brains suck.. It's true, but yea, you will always leave a trace..if someone targets you and wants you hunted and has the ends to justify the means they will bag and tag your ass. With any luck its a catch and release program and it was all for fun and your back in business like Jordan Belfort. Otherwise Goodnight cause it's time to wake up and I got work to do :: big yawn :: O.O

is mining worth the cost of the equipment and energy used or is is more of a hobby? where can I learn more about this and how to build a machine? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:46:11
only limit orders are free as far as I know.. so you could set an alert on your phone from coinbase for when it drops then rush to gdax and set a limit order for a few dollars more and hope it jumps a few bucks 
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:35:21
I will start by apologizing for my curt response. It was certainly not mean to be seen as boasting my friend, as I am not a wealthy man. I am simply stating that diversifying your bonds is a good start. $5 worth of BTC which I got for free for signing up to Coinbase turned into $42.68 today. The moral of my story is spread it all around a little and see what grows. Thank you for your time.

they insinuate that each transaction uses 200kwh but never say directly 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:21:21
shift pay thru coinbase is a visa card so it should be accepted everywhere. you can withdrawal up to 200$ a day from atms and spend up to $1000 per day. the card takes a little more money than needed incase of price fluctuation and the refunds the rest after the payment clears. pretty interesting.
*I see you said virtual but once the card is established you can use it online without swiping.

too much energy into the grid and it will be dissipated as heat or shunted directly into the ground.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:08:49
it means that it may sell a little lower than your stop price. this is because many other people may have set they same limit and there are only so many buyers at said limit. there is also going to be a fee for stop limit orders. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:12:53
because if the value is stable and consistent then it's something we can use for day to day transactions without the fear of fluctuating value.

investments are not "wow" factors.. this is our future we're talking about, not some get rich quick scheme. you invest what you can, invest what you believe in, follow up from time to time and stay educated and get back to life/work.
