Maybe that item is out of stock? I've bought from them several times and even their free shipping arrives in a couple of days.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:43:58
That's a pretty ignorant statement to make. You don't really know me...
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:32:12
Google Next? What happened to "Google Now"? 
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:35:46
They chose a bad time for this. I would buy if Bitcoin is &gt;$800
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:02:15
So in 8 days it will go up to $4,200

I'm 16. I don't have a bank account to connect to Coinbase.  All of my coins are from months and months of mining. I can't replenish if I spend
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:17:05
What if I am under 18? I don't pay taxes and all of my Bitcoin is from mining.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:46:59
Exactly. I believe in Bitcoin as a currency but it currently is way undervalued.
@_date: 2014-01-02 20:13:11
What is backing fiat? The only reason any currency has value is because people believe it does.
And don't say gold because what is backing gold?

Just put the backup in a TrueCrypt volume and you're good to go.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:57:59
These are so clever!
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:49:59
I'm one of the lucky ones who got in very early. It's so good I've started using it as my main address, plus I managed to grab my first name. I highly recommend using it.

@_date: 2014-01-02 20:27:20
Watch this
@_date: 2014-04-16 21:43:58
The episode is old but it's still cool
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:16:21
They're not a scam, they're just poorly run. I ordered my Jalapeno and received it. It's mining right now.
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:57:13
Yeah, Apple *totally* invented NFC payments...
@_date: 2013-10-29 03:25:49
Could you turn the image on the shirt into a wallpaper? That would be awesome!!! :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:34:07
Actually if you buy ASIC miners you're still helping the network become more secure. Buy one and mine for the fun and security, not the money.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:53:18
Oh no! It'd be a shame if I lost all 50,000 satoshis!
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:36:49
$4.69 --&gt; $243. A 5181% increase :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:25:29
Use Coinbase, they pay the fees for you.
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:58:28
"Bitcoin? I think I'll just stick to worthless pieces of paper that can be infinitely printed and are quickly losing value." - No one ever
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:21:28
The dollar is falling on its own anyways.. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:02:17
I made all of my coins mining, so Gyft works great for me since I don't have to go through a bank.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:39:29
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:24:46
Awesome! If you were in my class I would buy them all for BTC!!
@_date: 2013-10-29 05:13:10
It's okay :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 04:08:50
That better have been the best pizza ever.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:17:40
How can you afford to just give out BTC like that? xD
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:21:27
14, discovered Bitcoin when I was 13 but didn't do anything with it. I started mining before the big difficulty jump and made 0.2 BTC before spending it all on a Steam code. Boy that would be almost $70 today...
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:01:54
I've already donated over 0.1 BTC to the Pirate Bay :) 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:14:14
Looks good, keep it up!
Small suggestion: add a bit more color to it
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:15:00
There's a 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936 chance!
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:00:07
Mining since 2010? How much BTC have you made? Must be at least $50,000+ worth. 
Over 9000 Bitcoins perhaps?
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:41:29
I bought 1 ticket using 1PkGV7qiNpyuNiPLwdEn4pfMdAb3JxvsNn, and it showed up quickly without any problems. I hope I win! :) 
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:14:15
I just ordered a new graphics card from bitcoinstore.com with my BTC, should be here soon I'm so happy :)
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:01:28
I wish I had the money to buy one :c
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:16:35
That's wrong. It's a 1 in 2^256 chance or 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936. Your number is wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:59:44
This is kind of a dumb question, but do all jallys do 7gh/s now? Mine just shipped today but it says 5gh/s?
@_date: 2013-10-28 22:58:30
Finally. Another site that offers this service. The last one (I forgot its name) got shut down. I'll definitely try this out when I get some more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:53:48
I want one so bad but I don't think they accept Bitcoin :c
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:07:32
Sell it on eBay quickly, you might be able to make the money back.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:25:05
I mine other coins just so I can get more BTC. I've made 0.13BTC in one month mining on a GTX 680!
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:55:22
I love what you did with my design! :D
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:16:22
They are gone forever. It's okay with Bitcoin though, because it will just make them more valuable and they can always be used in smaller parts (0.00000001)
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:22:56
How is 0.25 BTC paying for itself? I paid 2.4 BTC for mine. (And its still not here yet)
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:13:07
Why did it already restart!!!???
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:13:35
Awesome! I might stop by later.
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:22:40
I think that the rich will end up buying it all anyway :(
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:07:40
It's... it's beautiful... want to share some of that? 
@_date: 2013-10-29 04:09:40
Show him the "What is Bitcoin?" video on 
That's how I introduced my Dad to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:31:53
Some random person named Ryan generously donated 0.0098 BTC. If you're out there, thank you. That might one day be worth &gt; $500
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:25:27
Been using Coinbase for over 8 months now. I've never had any issues. Just make sure to enable 2 factor authorization and don't use an API key unless you really need it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:38:44
This has a better interface than all of the other exchanges lol. Simple and to the point. Love it!
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:38:12
Bitcoin's looking better and better everyday :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 00:37:49
I want it to bubble and never pop! :)

@_date: 2013-10-26 02:36:22
Is there any chance I could still get a refund on my Jalapeno? I ordered it mid June 2013 and it hasn't shipped yet. I want a refund before I end up with a $308 paperweight.
