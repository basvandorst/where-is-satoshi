Many exchanges have investment money from miners like Bitmain, they like high fees and as long as people are willing to pay them, why use SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:23:35
Replace by fee or another method like child pays for parent. There is also a way to edit the transaction out the wallet manually and creating a new wallet to send a new transaction to replace the old one. There are ways to unstuck a transaction.

"shares" isn't a medium of exchange.
Bitcoin doesn't need conversion, just acceptance.
"alts" however are as you describe, they need to be converted into something that can be exchanged.
Bottom line, Bitcoin is superior to ALL competitors and eventually people will figure this out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:06:18
RBF works good if you had it enabled. You can up the fee over and over until you get one to go through. If you transaction is unconfirmed it will say replaceable. Click on it and you will see an option for increasing your fee. Increase it to want you want, sign it and broadcast the new transaction.  You can repeat as necessary.

Is it a surprise that Weiss would rate a completely centralized crypto higher than Bitcoin? 
It doesn't matter to them that it scales worse, is less secure, and technologically inferior to Bitcoin. And ETH is mutable while BTC is not. Mutability rates higher to Weiss.

Always use replace by fee when sending a transaction, then you can always up the fee and resend it if necessary.

I'm curious as to how this would work as well. If fees are so low, how does a node make money? How many transactions would your node have to route for any kind of profitability? What kind of hardware and bandwidth?

Umm, eth has an effective market cap in the trillions already. AND, there is nothing stopping a centralized shitcoin like eth from adding more tokens making it effectively a market cap of infinity.

Use replace by fee if enabled, if not enabled, you should've had it enabled. There are other methods for recovering a stuck transaction, Google is your friend.

Everyone had a chance to buy when it was cheap. What's more fair than that? Most people didn't believe in it or had the balls to put their fiat into it. Those of us who did were rewarded. You can still buy .10 BTC for $1500-1600 and when BTC reaches $1,000,000 you'll have $100,000 and when it reaches $10,000,000, you'll have $1,000,000. Those seem like good returns to me for a $1500-1600 investment.

When the mempool fills completely, it kicks the lower fee transactions out. It may take a while for yours to get kicked out. If you used replace by fee, you can add a higher fee to your transaction to get it through or just wait, eventually it will go through or get kicked out.

bcash is a scam because it is false advertising as low to zero fee transactions that are secure. Without fees, almost no one will mine it once the block reward is too low. Low to no miners equals low to no security and high centralization like it has now. Not to mention I hear the fees are already climbing.
99% of all cryptos are only used as speculation for get rich quick schemes, btrash included.

The tx fees are artificially high due to low/no segwit adoption from high transaction makers like coinbase/gdax. Low fee spam transactions also helped to increase the fees which have been kicked out the mempool. Then you also have people over paying fees to get to the head of the line.
The bottom line is it's all bullshit and all cryptos faced with the same problems Bitcoin is under would suffer the same way.
This will all be worked out in the future and I'm sure we'll face new problems down the road. If you don't believe in Bitcoin, best to get out, otherwise HODL.

Not sure but I'd be leery of any pool based out of China, the Chinese government has an iron grip and controls all within that country. Every Chinese company is forced to do the will of their government. I seriously doubt Jihan Wu is the super villain he's made out to be, for all we know the Chinese government has a gun to his family's head and he's just their puppet. Now, Roger Ver on the other hand, he's just a criminal scumbag looking to accumulate power and wealth at any cost, he doesn't care who gets hurt or who he deals with it in order to achieve his aims. Roger Ver is a despicable human being.

The whole mess we have right now is 100% bitmain's fault. If they didn't spam the network, delay SegWit, and create shitcash to try and cripple the network, we would be having no problems and be 10k+ right now.
So, if you have a problem right now, thank bitmain.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:42:54
Good advice. However, I'd worry more at 10k than 4k. I'd worry more towards November than now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:58:32
I guess I have to spell this all out for you. Bitmain has been spamming the network to push their agenda of larger blocks, higher fees, and the removal of core devs. It just amazes me how blind some people are.
BTW, 
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:02:20
LN is an option, there will be others in the future.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:49:00
Someone should sticky bcash and bitmain are behind slow and expensive transactions...
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:52:37
Bitmain has proven itself to be an enemy of Bitcoin. It's only a matter of time before they attack the network to help their failing bcash.

They want you to self snitch.
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:45:38
The main problem with them is they can not wrap their collective heads around alt coins. They believe in order for Bitcoin to soar ALL alts must die. They didn't learn anything from the last bull market.

It could be very dangerous to make transactions after the fork, you risk losing some of your coins. If you don't know what you're doing and are not very careful, you may find yourself much poorer.

You can't turn gold into lead, gold doesn't evolve. I can't take a pile of rocks and declare it gold. Any asset that can be replaced at will is essentially worthless. Now, what I can do with gold is find new applications for it making it more in demand and thus worth more.

No one really uses bcash but Korean and Chinese trading bots.
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:31:57
If you look at the volume on the Korean exchanges, you will notice it is mostly fake because in no other country does bcash have more volume than Bitcoin. My guess is that the Korean exchanges are heavily manipulated with trading bots and inside jobs. I believe the Korean exchanges were founded with money from Jihan and Roger. Traders on other exchanges are forced to follow those Korean pumps.

Obviously this was written by Roger Ver and heavy biased towards bcash and against Core/Bitcoin. Pathetic.

I feel bad for all the people who will get burned when Jihan and Roger decide to pull the rug out from under btrash.

Good question, all will probably be revealed in the next couple of months. Obviously they got some kind of plan. I wouldn't be surprised if Bitmain aligned miners break away from Bitcoin all together and concentrate on bcash and see if they can make a go of it.

Bitcoin holdings are in a grey area of the law in the US. It has not been codified into law. Some jurisdictions treat it as property while others currency.

From my understanding they are banning BTC to cash/cash to BTC transactions. Not mining BTC or BTC to BTC transactions. In any event, we may not know exactly until the dust settles. I don't think there has been an official Chinese gov public announcement what the actual ban entails.

Bitcoin should be worth about $5k, that's a fair market value for today. However, Bitcoin is highly speculative and people place huge wagers on what it will be tomorrow and so on.

And people wonder why the rate of cancer has been increasing since the nuclear age. Some nuclear particles have a half-life of over 1000 years, compare that to coal and gas, there's no comparison. Fission power is not safe and is not good for the environment. Fossil fuel contamination is nowhere near as bad as nuclear. You can clean an oil spill up, you can't clean up a meltdown, only close it off to the rest of the world and hope for the best. In the case of Fukushima, they can't stop the flow of nuclear contaminates into the environment.

The whole 2X fork is crazy imho. I'm surprised these CEOs are willing to risk hurting Bitcoin (and their business) at this point in the game for a unnecessary "block-size" (kicking out the Core Devs) increase. Maybe they feel this is their last chance to usurp development from Core and its worth risking everything for it, I don't know...
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:42:04
Each side has its own personal agenda, is that surprising?
Its all about the money and each side wants as much as possible.
Do you expect developers to work for free? Everyone has a right to make a living just not at the expense of Bitcoin.
I think the big-blockers would be more damaging to Bitcoin than the core developers.

Jihan has control of 50-75% of Bitcoin's hash, I'd call that a BIG problem. When he decides to wield that power against Bitcoin then we should change the POW. Having a discussion about it now isn't a problem.
Make no mistake, Jihan will use that power at some point because having power like that and not using it is pointless.

Coinbase plans to confuse users as much as legally possible by not calling Bitcoin Bitcoin, they will call it whatever they think they can get away with. I love to see how they spin this. I hope all these DCG fuckers get sued into bankruptcy.
I can't wait to see the whole b2x bigger block charade crash and burn and I hope the DCG goes with it.
The absurdity of miners and companies thinking they give Bitcoin value is so ridiculous. Without users Bitcoin is worthless and so are miners and any company built upon it.

Satoshi aint God and the white paper aint the bible. Projects evolve. Bitcoin has become MUCH more than just an electronic cash system. Satoshi disappeared and left it to the users. I wish people would stop trying to pigeon hole it into just peer-to-peer electronic cash.

Bitmain was never against SegWit, just Core.

I'm more sure 2X will fail than I was about bcash failing back in august, that had me temporarily worried.
As long as Bitcoin's price is higher than 2X, 2X has failed. Unless they add some EDA crap like bcash did, then they would be able to hang around for a while and things could get very ugly.
I just don't see how 2X can replace Bitcoin as it is currently constructed.

Looking at your post history, you're obliviously an r/btc / Bitmain / DCG / Big-block shill. Please go back to your sub, you do your employers no good here.

When it is necessary to increase the block size due to user demand, the developers will do it, its part of the roadmap. 1mb block size won't stand forever. b2x is not about block size but replacing the developers.

Not an upgrade, an alt coin creation. S2x is an alt coin, not Bitcoin.

I hate the IRS like most people but its a dangerous game to avoid taxes. If you transact in low amounts throughout the year I wouldn't worry about it. However, you your transactions start to add up, better get your papers in order, the taxman will arrive and expect his due.

Cheating the taxman has SIGNIFICANT risks. The taxman don't give a fuck, he will track you down and audit the shit out of you and make you pay with fines/interest or jail time or both. Good luck though )

This is pushing the crypto market further down than it would have normally went correction wise.

Its simple, some people just cannot wrap their mind around Bitcoin. It doesn't surprise me. Its something that is so new and revolutionary that it seems to some as a fantasy. They just don't (can't) get it. Bitcoin goes against this construct some people have built in their minds about how things like money, wealth and finance are suppose to go.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:46:26
At r/btc, everything is a blockstream/core conspiracy to destroy Bitcoin. They also believe bcash is really Bitcoin and the rest of the world has been duped by core into believing that SegWit/Bitcoin is an altcoin designed to destroy Bitcoin. Pure ridiculousness.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:48:16
Its been my experience that the average poster has less than 1 total BTC. The longer someone has been around, generally the more they have, unless they sold all thinking Bitcoin was dead at some point.
Also bear in mind, 57% of US citizens have less than $1000 in savings and 49% live paycheck to paycheck.
I'm not sure what the averages are for the rest of the world but I doubt its any better.

I like the idea of bgold, especially using equihash. There are too many unknowns with it though. I also don't like that it is forking around the time of 2X, that could cause problems with splitting coins. 
The other thing is, I have noticed most alts seem to pump after they are released. I probably won't sell right away unless the initial price is really high like over $600, otherwise the risk with coin splitting is just too high. I don't want to make a mistake with the coin splitting, for me, I have a lot money in Bitcoin and would be devastated if I messed up, you know?

Can't be any worse than bcash. At least they're not trying to compete or replace Bitcoin. More power to them, let them do their thing. Just be careful with your private keys as always.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:08:43
Talk about a boneheaded move. I liked "as in past tense" Gemini too. Pretty ridiculous of them to take this stance now as most are recognizing 2X as an altcoin.

I hope they investigate bcash and all the scammy manipulations from bitmain.
