Believe it or not I went to high school with a Mellon. Kid's dad had money out the ass. This kid would get new iphones weekly for breaking them in fits of rage.
He was a huge douchebag though.

Ok I'll bite.
First off, am I correct in saying that it is some mutation of that radiohead lyric, and we can add/replace/move letters?
From a programming point of view, if the string is between 40-50 characters of A-Z,a-z,0-9,plus !@ that's 70 characters, so there are a possible 40^70 + 41^70 ... 50^70, which is 1.115873e+119.
Let's say we can test a high estimate of 100,000 wallets a second, that includes generating the wallet and checking it for the bitcoins. That means it will take 1.115873e+114 seconds, or 3.53841e+106 YEARS. So yes the universe will end before you can crack this.
Essentially OP sent us on a fool's errand, don't waste your time.

Why the fuck has no one said yet that the feds CLEARLY planned this on November 5th?
"Remember remember the 5th of November, the gun powder treason and plot."

It showed up eventually. I just went to blockchain.info and picked the most recent transaction, meaning your backend was probably waiting for confirmations or something.

Someone put a snippet of old virus code into the blockchain or something. I remember seeing something about it on here a while back.

If you're going to self promote just tell us to look at your website, don't forget to login to your throwaway and act like you just saw it for the first time.

Cool idea.
It's not pulling the balance of my wallets for some reason.

What you're proposing is just a voting system, so I ask you, who the fuck cares?
The current voting systems around the world may not be perfect but they're sure a hell of a lot better than having a secure-through-obscurity system distributing keys and hashes, which will inevitably get hacked and the whole thing will go to shit in a matter of weeks.

Exactly what I was looking for, thanks a ton!
