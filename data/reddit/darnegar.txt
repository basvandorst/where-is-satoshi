To be honest I'm kind of rooting for a great correction. Yeah sure to buy cheaper but all in all everyone needs to chill a bit and let the development take it's course, as I very much understand as a developer myself.
It's a very interesting time indeed, I truly believe Bitcoin (and Crypto) is able to fix a very important issue with modern society that is the root of a lot of problems, so here's to not fucking it up.

TLDR for the new guys out there:
He's a fraud.
Claimed he's Satoshi Nakamoto (unknown inventor/s of Blockchain Technology &amp; Bitcoin) without any proof.
Uses big and drammatic words to attempt to intimidate the audiences.Arguments range from not making any sense at all to trivial public knowledge at best...Just watch the video.

Very well said. Thank You.

Is that how you solve your problems by ignoring them and "Focus on good things in life"? This guy is getting people misled, lies and bullshits in their faces and gets away with it...I believe something such as this post might prove as a counter argument and gets people to question without following blindly. That is enough motivation for me to AT LEAST put this video here, wouldn't you agree?

How long does the time between each cycles last? I've only been in the crypto-sphere for almost a year now so not that much (an eternity in crypto lol but real life not so much).
To continue on your argument I would say this is the penultimate cycle, with the following one seeing a majority of newbie money rushing in.

Very well explained, thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:32:39
Hardly a sensible argument, but I get your point.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:16:41
Wonder why they are so full of hatred though...get a life people the world is big enough for everyone

I've heard recently from reliable sources that blockchain advisors are getting paid shit-tons at the moment. Any comment on this?

Having said this I do like to image that revolutionary tech such as IOTA and old gold steam engines like Bitcoin can and will co-exist. I imagine Bitcoin as being a high value store of wealth, while IOTA is easily used for any type of payments, be it small or large.

It's really sad actually...people are profiting A LOT from the lost money of the uneducated. I guess this is a part of any developing scenario but it's unjust at the very least

Not only this but other solutions like Tangle, HashGraphs, etc, might prove to kick blockchain in the nuts and take it's place...a sccary and exciting time it is.

Just keep in mind that he's one of those men who if they are drowning and you jump in to help them, they will drown you to save themselves.
Roger had this coming and deserves nothing better. Don't be fooled to show him any mercy, he'll back stab you the second the opportunity arises.

I tend to agree with you. The proof is there.
However putting CSW aside for a moment (who is obviously a fraud and needs to be locked up), do you really want to put the burden of Satoshi Nakamoto on now unfortunately, just Nick Szabo? 
IMO if he wanted the publicity he would have got it. The way I see it it's an open, unverified secret, and should remain that way. A man so bright and sensible as to create digital tamper-proof gold doesn't tweet in his yellow lamborghini.

We need to market Bitcoin to Venezuela, the people need to know there are solutions out there which are bigger than their governance, and which they can use.
Apart from that, the exposure Bitcoin would get once Venezuela gets back on its feet is priceless. Win-win situation.

Could it be that Ver/Wright is under the payroll of the U.S government to in any way affect the general's public view on Bitcoin and Crypto?
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:16:39
How difficult was it to implement this?
I am very interested in developing something similar as a developer myself, but I have not started any development on it at the moment because of other projects.
Great works it looks awesome, would I be asking too much if I ask you how you started out on it and what technologies did you use? Cheers

I'm inclined to believe (tinfoil hats on) that Ver is under the thumb of the U.S Government (CIA) and purposely creates these forks to get new comers to invest in them and get bitten, putting them off of Bitcoin and picturing it as a scam.
This would explain why he works with Craig Wright as well, who's clearly a scam artist and doesn't know shit.
Just my two satoshis.

I find it hard imagining that the creator and inventor of the bitcoins would just ditch his portion of the wealth like that...maybe he's just HODLING.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:27:48
But there is always a reason why it increases AND decreases
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:50:19
that takes guts...respect.
How are finding it so far, two years in?
