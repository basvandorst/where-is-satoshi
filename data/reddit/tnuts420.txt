samourai wallet. technically still in beta, but for my money it is hands down the best wallet for android

yeah, this is the only answer that makes any sense to me. massive wallet, dormant since 2014, just wakes up out of nowhere and stars moving coins to binance all the sudden

ok, so full disclosure i am one of the assholes who runs a full node and doesn't run lightning. it's not that i don't fully support lightning, or second layer scaling in general for that matter, but i'm personally trying to amass as much bitcoin as possible right now, not buy coffee with it, so it hasn't been much more than philosophical support for me up to this point. 
this post is the straw that broke the camel's back. you dicks have finally shamed me into figuring it out and running lightning on principal. i hope you're happy

i guess so. it's really more feeling like i'm not doing what i can to support something i believe in, which is why i started running a full node in the first place. but a couple extra sats never hurt nobody!

i'll be honest, i didn't understand most of the words in that article. i did however like the fact that the information seemed to be appreciated, and utilized by the site. especially since you guys have the password to my checking account.
