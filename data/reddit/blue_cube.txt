I totally agree - it would be great to see better UIs for PGP as well. The challenge that both PGP and Bitmessage try to tackle is a very large one, and there's definitely more than one way to go about it.

I would argue that the fact that we're all still using email on a daily basis, despite knowing how insecure it is and wanting a better alternative, is very good evidence that Bitmessage is far from pointless.    
You could certainly argue that there are other ways we could try to solve the problem of finding a method to easily communicate securely, but to say that the project lacks any useful point or purpose seems a little far-fetched to me.

You could have a look at this list:   
There's also  which uses chans to create a Twitter-like service based on Bitmessage.

In general, you're right that it's difficult to verify that the apps / programs you use aren't malicious.   
In the case of open source projects such as Bitmessage (or indeed Bitcoin), the community relies on each other to vet the source code over time. For example, Bitcoin has been around for ~5 years, and the code to the reference client has been available for all that time, so we can be reasonably sure that there aren't any malicious backdoors in it.    
In the case of Bitmessage, it's a smaller project than Bitcoin and so has had less scrutiny, but the code for the reference client has been open source for ~1.5 years and looked at by a lot of people, so we can be reasonably confident that it also doesn't contain any backdoors or other malicious features.    
I hope that helps.

My kind of people :)

Thankfully implementations can improve. That's what we're working on now.

Thanks! And yes, I believe this may actually qualify as "good news".

I actually think Bitmessage's community is one of the best things about it.   
There's precious little money to be made in giving away free, open-source, encrypted messaging software, so the community is, at least in my experience, largely composed of people who care about giving people a way to communicate privately.  
For example, anyone can go to  and read what's going on. I don't think that "pedophiles and foul mouthed teenagers" is a fair represenation of the people you'll find there.

I agree, I thought it gave a very strong overview of things. Matt deserves a lot of credit for this.

Bitmessage uses a proof of work system to deter spam and network flooding. Basically, sending a message requires that the sender do some computational work, which can then be used to anonyously 'prove' to the P2P network that the message has value to someone and should be relayed onwards.   
People sometimes attempt to disrupt the network by sending out large numbers of messages, but because there's no economic incentive to do so, the attacks usually subside in a day or two. You can actually see that reflected in the traffic charts.

Your concerns are quite valid, but yes, I think I can convince you that all is not lost :)    
- Scalability: In the short term, Bitmessage's scalability will be significantly improved by Version 3 of the Protocol (see  In the long term, true scalability will come with the implementation of streams. Implementing streams correctly will be very challenging, but there's no reason to think it can't be done (see  for some of the proposals).   
- Message sending delay: Version 3 of the protocol also radically improves the situation with proof of work, which is the cause of the delay you refer to. By making the 'time to live' of a message variable and adjusting the proof of work requirement based on that, we can dramatically reduce the delay in sending a message. This will be particularly significant with the imminent introduction of lite clients, such as the Android app.   
Bitmessage is a hugely ambitious project and it's going to take significant time and effort to get it to a point where it's as reliable as email, a 40 year old technology. If people are willing to contribute then I think there's every chance it can succeed.

I would beg to differ, but you're welcome to your opinion. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:36:52
Firstly, I would take issue with your description of the people working on Bitmessage as "all you fucking bitcoin assholes" and "IGNORANT YOUNG OVERENTHUSIASTIC KIDS". I don't know what your experience of the Bitmessage or Bitcoin communities has been, but I cannot say that this description tallies with my own.   
Secondly, with regards to PGP, the blog post addresses this point directly in its opening paragraphs: "Today, if you want to send someone a message that needs to stay private, the sensible thing to do is to use a tool called GPG. It’s tried and tested technology, but it’s also hideously difficult for normal people to use." Hence Bitmessage, which is an attempt to give people a way to encrypt their messages as securely as with PGP, but to do so in an easy-to-use way, so that people will actually use it regularly.    
Thirdly, thank you for your polite feedback and criticism :)

You're right - we should avoid confusion between the two. A brief summary for anyone unfamiliar:  
Bitmessage is a system for secure communication (like email but more secure). Much of its technology is derived from Bitcoin, and there's a lot of overlap between the two communities, but they are separate systems with different goals (currency vs. communication). The Bitmessage project website is

Agreed. Gavin deserves a huge amount of respect for acting so professionally.

OTR is still the best solution for instant chat. Bitmessage is designed to be much closer to email (i.e. usually a relatively long time between each message). 
PGP is indeed a proven solution, but it is difficult enough to use that it has only gained very limited adoption. The idea of Bitmessage is to be easy to use while making all messages strongly encrypted by default, in order to defeat the kind of universal surveillance that the NSA et al are now indulging in. 
The Bitmessage white paper explains the aims of the system quite well:
