Yes I believe that is what is known as a 'moving price' formation.  What that means is that the price is changing - first by going lower, then by going higher.  This is extremely unusual in all areas of investing and is a strong buy indicator.  Or is it a sell indicator?  Damn... I can't remember but if you figure it out let me know.

Someone was pranking you.  I'm really good at tracking down pranksters so if you get any more calls from that number just let me know exactly what the guy says.  Specifically anything about money.  Maybe that will give me some clues that will help me find this kid before he swats you.
