Hi! I'm very sorry to hear about how long it's taking for your ticket(s) to be addressed. Please PM me your ticket number and I'll hunt someone down to see what the hold up is.

Sorry to hear that, as Thomas said we're behind (but actively fighting through the backlog!). Do you have a ticket number you can PM me so I can have someone take a look?
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:32:40
Yep, they're the same. I've reached out and hope to have some action on your account very soon. Thanks for your patience and sorry for the wait!

Hi! Sorry to hear that nobody has gotten back to you on that--I'll have to look into that as well...
Could you please PM me your ticket # so I can get someone to take a look?

Hi, if you could please provide a ticket number or your public account ID I could ask someone to take a look. Please don't share your username/email in public

Hello friend! There are a number of reasons why this could happen, most of which are no problem (but do require a manual check before we can confirm it). Could you please open a support ticket and PM me your ticket number so I can get someone to take a look?

That is interesting information--perhaps the bank changed it along the way or placed the info in the wrong place. Please respond to the agent who helped you with this info so you can ensure swift processing of future funding.

Hi! We're making good progress on the verification front, lowering the wait time pretty much every day. It is still longer than we'd like however, and the recent price actions are causing huge influxes of interest.
If you'd like you can PM me and I'll have a contact in the department try to take a look tonight. This goes for anyone else who's currently waiting in queue as well--I'll be around for 4-5 more hours.

Hi there, sorry to hear about the delay you've experienced. The recent influx of new interest has generated some backlog that we are working through to the best of our ability.
Please PM me your support request number and I will ask someone to take a look as soon as possible.

Hi there, sorry about the confusion. I've reached out to a few people about this issue (thanks for including your support ticket number!).
The agent who addressed your ticket likely misread/mis-typed their response. You are correct that you shouldn't need an intermediary bank to send USD to a Canadian bank.
For pending withdrawals please allow 1-5 business days for them to be fully processed. As for the failed ones, the reason for this will likely be shared with you once the agent responds to your ticket. I'm not personally knowledgable enough to guess at what might have caused it.
Again, sorry for the confusion here. Let me know if you have any questions!
