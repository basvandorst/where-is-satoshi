This is just retarded on so many levels. Blockchain was invented exactly to prohibit this kind of behaviour and give transparancy to this kind of under the table deals. Not only are you bragging about but this retarded community is upvoting it, such a shame :(

Its 50% eff3ctive, either you did it properly or you didnt.

Freedom should be infinite so this doesnt add up.

You know there are other countries besides usa, so if limited supply was great at least one would do it and be great or whatever the hell you get from limited supply. The other thing is, it will be limited when all of us are dead, before that it is beeing printed and has been for last 10 years at much higher rate than fiat so this just doesnt make sense.

And why is limited freedom?

Most useless investment in your life. First you paid higher price for a game because of fees and second in 6 months time when you stop playing that game you would have twice the money in usd.

Thanx on good answer, I have mixed feelings about LN, I get it, its 2nd layer solution but we are missing that our trx are recorded in immutable ledger. There is a reason blockchain was invented and that is because p2p trx systems were not good enough. With LN you basically get escrow system where 3rd party provider for security is not a centralized company but blockchain. Guess it needs to grow on me to like it :)

Thats just crazy thinking. Lets all spend much more money for benefit of community. I am all for crypto but in seamless less expensive way. We need to have real benefits from it to make it worth. It wont ever hit the mainstream in a state its now and people will think we are retarded suggesting crypto will replace cash.
It has to cost to pay less for a game with btc (no bank or cc fees, less fraud) and  be faster to process with some integrated wallet, like metamask for eth and you just click pay. That is when things are going to work and be valuable and make sense.

If this is true I would say crypto is seriously undervalued at this moment.

Ok I get your point. Thing is that if channel stays open for years, how is this blockchain anymore? I mean there is certain benefits you get from your transactions being recorded in BChain. Where will be all LN trx recorded I see that some local/cloud backups are mentioned but there is no more immutable global ledger to confirm trx between parties. I know guys working on LN must be thinking of how to solve important problems but there must be some down sides to LN and if not, then why have blockchain at all, lets all just make transactions in one big LN and don't waist resources on mining. This are just some doubts that came to mine mind.

Looks like shit.

He just wants to rehabilitate so he can get back in the game.

Thnx, "its a network" makes more sense. Watching some video explanations some time ago always showed 1-1 connections in side chain and it somehow stuck that this was it. Ok so if this is all routed in off chain, when do connections close and when its decided that something needs to go onchain?
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:00:43
But does it make sense if its mostly one time payments that go back to blockchain? Maybe i got some details wrong so please explain if i am missing something.

Why would you say you run your own bank when having node? Just having a wallet/address is enough to have your own bank, right?
