i tried this morning, but living in Canada has posed some challenges for buying bitcoin as of yesterday.   MasterCard Deposits onto crypto exchanges as of yesterday are no more.   Additionally, Scotiabank has blocked all transactions to Exchanges.   Silly me having only 2 credit cards and both being mastercard.    I'm working on finding a visa or visa debit card that will allow deposits.  I'm also working on taking my business elsewhere.

i mean...small sample size, but it looks like for now i did stop, and as the title says, recovered over 2k.     
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:20
newer and newer lows that haven't been seen in about.... 2 weeks?

I gonna have a seizure.   Gdax is all over the place.   16200, 17900, it cant make up its mind.

Not your keys, Not your Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:27:41
you are an early adopter.   6 years before the invention of Bitcoin.   Congrats
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:18
Bitcoin is rarely stable.    Additionally, is a 35% dip indicative of anything?   Its happened several times in the last several months.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:07:37
Its kind of like when Mom or Dad curse, you know they mean business.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:55
That sucks.  I was not aware that there was limits on Nicehash you had to hit before you could transfer to ones personal wallet.   To be fair, I keep a small amount on an exchange for reasons, and I am well aware that it could be hacked.   Someone could also steal the 20 dollar bill in my desk at work.   Its an acceptable risk for me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:46
when you posted this 5 mins ago, that would appear to be a good time.  Its gone up 1400 in the last 5 mins.    What a ride!

Not sure if that was sarcasm or not, but I thought it actually did explain a lot.   They are overwhelmed.   At least it looks like they are trying to expand as quickly as they can.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:56:30
here I figured I'd have to "work Late" to see it fall.  Nope, about 10 seconds and it was gone and up to 14150.   This is bonkers

gdax went crazy.  hit the 14k wall, bounced down to 13700 and now its frozen lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:13:52
That 200 Bitcoin Wall was torn down in less than 5 seconds and went to 13068.  Incredible.

Did you just assume my Gender?    
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:30
piggyback.  I have used credit card for coinbase in the past before I knew about gdax.  Can I use Credit card to deposit money and then transfer to gdax without any fees?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:44:24
it sure did, gdax seems to be back.  I can't log in to coinbase as of now.   Gdax on the top left says Partially Degraded Service.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:47
I think it just hit 8k on the okcoin exchange
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:28:51
Should have used a Hard Fork instead of a knife.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:31:03

I would have preferred he used a Hard Fork instead of a Knife
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:20
You had wished you sold at 11k and bought at 8800.   Yeti77 is saying you would be better off wishing to invest in Bitcoin a number of years ago so that the return is much greater than %20ish that you wished for. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:11
I am sad, coinbase website down, I saw it go below 9000 and wanted to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:12
It sure did!   that's 5000 Toonies!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:53:13
those last 4 cents to 10k are gonna take a while me thinks
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:13:15
and there she goes!  I was glued for an hour watching it chip away towards 10k, and now in 30 seconds it drops 60 bucks.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:17:56
Danke schön

you loled, I hodled 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:49:52
either the 12 word password, or the actual wallet id which is some random 16ish letter/number combination.

It is a ULC 2 hour rated fire safe (water proof as well).  But yes, my family does have a safety deposit box I can put it in there.
that said.  Why do I have to write all this info down for the private key for my digital wallet.   I have an app on my phone that I put a 4 digit number in and there is all the info.  Should I not have the app?   Is the private key just for if I forget my 4 digit code?
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:08:17
This makes sense.  Thank you.   
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:04:37
Okay thank you.   Why shouldn't I use blockchain.info.  It was suggested on several posts and a quick google search told me it was one of the main wallets that people use.
Yes I will make a copy and put it in a safety deposit box.
