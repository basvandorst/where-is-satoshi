I've always wanted to have a Tyrone Biggums style $450k coke party. There would be lots of drinks, drugs, women, and very few memories. You can come too if you want!

The haven released that information yet.

I tend to agree with you. What you are saying is there is virtually no market for them NOW, other than to facilitate illicit transactions. What I hear BTC bugs saying is that the value of them will come when the dollar collapses, to facilitate currency exchanges and bypassing capitol controls. As it stands at this moment in time, there is virtually no market for them.

You need to physically go to wells Fargo and deposit cash into the seller's account.

I'm a fan of Peter Schiff. I think he's right about a lot of things. He's wrong about bitcoin though.

You cannot have your bitcoin stored both on coinbase and a hardware wallet. You would need to transfer them off coinbase for secure storage, and then back to coinbase if you want to sell them.

This. Also Philippines has regulated bitcoin exchanges.

Absolutely. All the capital and developer skill and manpower that was going into ICO's will be freed up and hopefully be used to improve bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the real deal. Even etherium is plagued by irreconcilable bugs. If you invest in alt coins, sure you can 10x your investment, but a lot more alts fail than succeed. I prefer to invest my hard earned fiat in the one with the proven track record. Don't forget, btc is still in its infancy. We could easily go from 5k to 50k in a few years.
I remember years ago when max keisar was calling for 250k btc when it was at $10. I thought he was crazy. Now I can see a path towards that. Now he's calling for $1million btc. I still think he's crazy, but I can't help but think in 10 years it might not be so crazy.

China didn't ban bitcoin. They banned ICO's, which is actually good for bitcoin because it redirects all that capital investment and development back into bitcoin where it belongs.

China only banned ICO's, not bitcoin.

Of course miners like segwit2x. They get to mine empty blocks because there are no transactions. nobody is using it and it will die. Original btc is what has all the infrastructure and transactions supported by vendors, exchanges, developers, and institutional investors.

I hope so. The more distributed the better.

There are negative articles every day. 99bitcoins.com compiles a list of them every day called bitcoin obituaries. They're good for a laugh.

I mean it's possible, but HIGHLY unlikely.  the number of possible private keys is greater than the number of atoms in the universe.

Market cap is a terrible way to think about currency supply. Comparing the value of all bitcoins in existence to the market cap of a corporation is about as pointless as comparing the amount of gold or dollars in existence to the market cap of a company.
