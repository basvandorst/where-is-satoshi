Well you can hedge your bets and put some cash into altcoins too. I have some money in Ether and LTC for that reason.

tbh I think the demand for Crypto in general will mitigate that. It's worth diversifying I think. I hold three cryptos including BTC.

Better late than never. Maybe he will be early in the grand scheme. One can hope!

Tbh I got into the game shortly before the crash. I HODLd and have since broken even, in fact a little ahead. Hardly a good amount yet. Nothing more HODLing won't solve. I am a simple man. If it gets me a nice house I am happy.

Exactly the best time to buy is in the past. Since I don't have a TARDIS I suppose now will have to do.

I am literally brand new to this (yes I heard about it ages ago, but didn't jump in). Bought £150 and the fees are almost earned back already. Anyone got any advice for a newbie like me?

I put an extra £50 in all I could spare
 (DAMN YOU CHRISTMAS SHOPPING!)

That's what I did today, just getting into it myself.
£50 in BTC
£30 in Ether
£20 in LTC
£100 is a reasonable first dabble i think, especially with Christmas coming up.

Thanks. I will look into it.

This is why spreading it around can help mitigate this.

Are there minimum amounts with that?
