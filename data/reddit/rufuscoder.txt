Okay, if you going to state you opinion stop citing the same fucking article in every comment you make. If you want people to here you out do a fucking google search.

At least Google isn't like Apple. They have Bitcoin wallets on there platform and Play Store, that look and feel a hell of a lot better then the iOS Blockchain app did. They also haven't criticized Bitcoin yet(Correct me if wrong) and are thinking about ways they could possibly embrace it.

I am not sure how Coinkite's support is but I've heard Coinbase's is flawed.

That would be a very useful aspect to the product. I wonder how many Bitcoin enthusiasts will use or pay for the Coinkite card.

For things like that I use Tormail, accessible through the Tor network.

Cool paintings! Hope Bitcoin helps you too succeed!

Bitcoins are anonymous in a sense, which makes them perfect for money laundering and drug trade. But people who criticize this flaw, don't realize that other currencies have even more of this activity including the US dollar. The future of Bitcoin is going to be tested. They will try to regulate it, but will they succeed?

What's his username, so we can red flag him?

I don't like it because its hard to be anonymous. Personally I use any of the exchange, I mostly buy from localbitcoins

Wonder if they have a pharmacy...

I would install CyanogenMod without installing anything created that has a direct link to Google.

Damn it, that's too bad. We could have made a scheme to catch him.
