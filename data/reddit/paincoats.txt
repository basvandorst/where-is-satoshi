I've never been there, but it should be dot slash. What the hell does /. even
    -bash: /.: is a directory
    -bash: ././/././../.././..//././/.///../.././: is a directory
haaa no it's not dummy

Linux installs are so easy, all you have to type is `kdd jddkdjdjjddjdjiddj. Disuse diddle jesusquery jsjsaush disk shahs jddkdjdjjddjdjiddj jssksj` if you're running Debian or `dkjd isisjs I disengage didisosossososo issue ` if you use a doejebidhf-based distro then all you have to do is edit your /etc/jsjsajshgwo and also remember to `fndusgbf fhhfjdefihff ahff 3rfff`all dependancies such as python otherwise you'll get an error and spend half an hour copying and pasting things into terminal whilst wishing you just stayed on windows
That's how that reads to people who don't know bash

Yeah you really don't want too much access to that stuff IMO, I mean I could get a hundred pills to my door, but what if I got caught? I would have just ruined my own life.

    If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
    And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss; ...
    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
    And—which is more—you’ll be a man, my son!

fucking dun and bradstreet, completely unrelated but they decided to take out 1k from my account last year for 'debt collection', took ages to get it back, smarmy cunts

Same here, when it was about $0.20 each. 
Eh, I probably would have held way too long anyway.
