Don't hate the player, hate the game. Dogecoin was designed as a joke (creator still agrees it is) so the design is, what it is. They can mine the fuck out of it and dump, the problem itself isn't them, but the coin itself. If it was as good and valuable, the coins would be a bargain. You can blame multipools or whatever, but it's all an illusion on the fundamentals of the coin. 
If the creator took it more seriously, he would've took his ego aside and considered the merits of litecoin offer. Instead he basically said, maybe we will be bigger than you guys soon.

I think day trading is like poker and sex, everyone thinks they are good at it. Regardless, numbers don't lie. I have successfully traded for a number of years. 
No, just because someone checks the price often does not automatically mean they are in it for the short term. I find it interesting the attitude towards short term holders. Personally I don't care, but I sense others feel superior to them.

You can go by the data from the top few companies, multiply, and it still won't be significant.

What's the purpose of the government? Ensure society runs smoothly? Represents the people? Something along those lines? At least it was. 
Freedom belongs to the people. If everyone wants it, why should the government stop it?

I am curious on the effect on coinjar too. They have to find a new bank fast or close. I think due to Ryan having a bad rep, it would be a good idea to take all funds out of there ASAP. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:21:43
I would cry wondering where did my other coins go.

It was pretty amusing, but this would be a little too much. I think a better option would be to sell the iPhone to buy the nexus 5, using the leftover for charity or something else. 
A little boring I know but blowing up more iPhones just reduces supply, the opposite of what you would like to achieve. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:14:14
Blockchain.info helped. This gives much more credibility. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 08:42:26
Is it coinjar? Also what iD is needed?
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:05:03
Two reasons. Doge comes here to upvote and bitcoiners own doge.

Not that I agree with them, but they don't have a choice at this point. 
This assumes (likely but not definitely) they are insolvent.

I was her first customer using bitcoin. Tall asian girl right? They were clueless when I was there, but her daughter came over after 5 mins. 
She was really excited and happy, a little confused and didn't know how to use bitpay. 
Yes it was expensive.

Blindly is the key word here. They don't care about bitcoin, they heard regulation and saw $$$. Fuck them.

The people who lost all their coins had no problems until the last moment. 
Just don't put too much on any wallet website, especially coinjar. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:40:52
I used it last week as well. Very damn quick, but it cost me 10% more to buy. Maybe if the mark up was lower I would consider using again. 
I didn't need sms or fingerprint, maybe because I did the $20 minimum.

send 800btc with a signed message to get their attention 
@_date: 2014-07-23 10:29:19
Hopefully more competition in the future. 10% mark up. Fast though.

Would be better if google incorporated bitcoin with their wallet. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 07:49:44
I put in 150% of myself in bitcoin. Most of it was $900+. I continue to eat crap food, hoping this will pay off. 
No comment about putting in more than you can lose please.

They are one of the most efficient in charity organisations. They find charities (based on evidence) that are efficient. I hope others email them and ask them about accepting bitcoins. I will donate 1BTC if they do accept it and hope others pledge to donate some amount.

I highly doubt it will be released at it is. There will be some changes. They probably decided to lean towards the stricter side of things to give some room for movement. Imagine if it was the other way around. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:57:44
The spread is not reasonable.

How much privacy is there with this? Is there fingerprints and such?

irc chat, people say the same thing. For me, I took the time to explain the positives and negatives of doge, and the admin deleted it. I can't remember exactly who, but the admin name was pretty short. Someone from irc asked him about it, and he replied something along the lines of "Yeah, he was spreading fud". 
And no, the post wasn't fud. It was an explanation (in detail) on why removing the 100b cap was bad. (Doesn't matter if you agree with it or not, its just a discussion).

Life is rare. Against all the odds, the universe is in the right condition for planets and stars to develop. Our planet is lucky to be the right temperature to harvest life. Life is rare, but consciousness is even rarer. To be living now and not the past is very lucky indeed. 
Regardless of your circumstances, we are all very lucky. Let's not waste it.

Would you trust Mt Gox again? What if they opened a new exchange and people forgot about it? This is exactly this.

I won't bother warning anymore, good luck.

I've mentioned this before, I highly recommend taking whatever you can out ASAP. The owner is known for scamming in the past.

Without going to too much detail, I can say gambling is not a problem.

If only the spread was appropriate I would it much more. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:33:42
Basically these posts gets downvoted or deleted. It looks like begging and does nothing. Plus posting bitcoin addresses is generally not allowed. 
I could send money to myself and pretend someone gave me it also. Either way, doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:48:24
I love bitcoin and all but I will not be using the atm till it becomes more reasonable. 
Fiat, at the moment, is just cheaper and more feasible. The future will be better. I can imagine saying "back then bitcoin ATMs had a 10% mark up. Also commbank can do cash withdraws with your phone only now at some ATMs. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 21:58:07
Not this again, see this so often. What is the combined weekly sale of bitcoins being converted? 500 coins?1000 coins? I'll pretend it's 5000 coins which is 3million dollars a week. Look at some of the volume on the exchanges. Doesn't add up. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:04:52

Hi Mark.
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:31:56
We could die any moment. The system that holds all our money in banks could have a bug. 
At least we know people have reviewed the code, and continues to do so. After many years, the chance of it decreases but still possible. Much like the heart example. It's a risk, a small one imo but still there. One of the only things that could cause bitcoin to go to 0. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:37:32
I hope coinbase can do a deal to charge less or no fees with charity and some non-profit organisations.

I think this shows a desperation, or maybe a strong belief, in investing into bitcoin infrastructure. 
Give it time before some good investments can be made. This comes as proper businesses understand bitcoin. I do think by the time they do, the good investments will not be available to the public.

Did I mention anything about my current situation? I was a day trader in the past. I mentioned its fine to watch the price in my op IF I was trading, which I am implying I am not, thus pointless.

There was a huge buy up of short lending on bitfinex before the attack. There was no problem with bitfinex. Increased volume over there (24% of all trades iirc). Maybe someone shorted. 
Speculating of course.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:09:34
It was LIKE as though Mark did, as in, heaps of shit happened, overtime people forgot, and he came back. Of course Mark didn't open a fucking exchange. Im done. Downvote all you want.

From experience, any negative comments about them gets downvoted. Comments and threads. 
Yes I am sick of it. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 01:39:56
With projects like this, and more to come, it's hard to argue there's nowhere to spend bitcoins. Price will follow, and if it doesn't, it's okay. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 07:39:35
Much more expensive for using bitcoin as they can't do recurring payments. Hopefully bitpay or others can deal with recurring payments soon. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:54:52

Never going to get one full bitcoin, in your lifetime? The problem is elsewhere. 
Jokes aside, best way to view it is the potential vs the possibilities. The term market cap probably isn't right, but good enough. Bitcoin is worth 6-7billion, that is nothing in the grand scheme of things. 
One bitcoin is silly, but psychologically important. I wish satoshi produced 10x more so we wouldn't be having this problem. In saying that, bits might catch on. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:15:25
I think the worst part was admins deleting most negative posts. The justification was spreading fud. 
It can be quite scary over there when they talk about 1 doge = 1 doge and they are almost convincing themselves that price doesn't matter. 
Most lack basic understanding of economics. The solution to a falling price is to tell everyone in the community to buy $1 of doge a day, or "get the owner to set the price at $1 per doge".  
I understand this isn't a representation of the whole community and sometimes we get this stuff over here. But damn. 
With regards to being cult like, some will argue we are like that too. But I see the difference. Over there, selling is fud and taboo, you are weak hands, bad shibe, and so forth. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:24:01
The fees seem high at the moment, but this was expected. This is due to risks, costs, along with low to no competition. As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, competition increases and fees will go down. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:08:54
Old news: 
Sadly. They charge close to an extra 50% more for using bitcoins and provide fewer options. 
Edit: $24.95 with credit card, $34.95 using bitcoin. (Monthly). Yearly one is only a small premium, but should be same or cheaper.

Sure no fees, but if coinjar (it uses coinjar) didn't have a huge spread, it would be used.
