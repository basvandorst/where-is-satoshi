Did my first TigerDirect buy with btc, 2nd time spending bitcoin besides buying a car last year! 
Anyway to give clients the option of coin base or bit pay?
Also maybe update the site and survey part to allow feedback for bitcoin sales?
Some of these merchants must consider supporting blockchain as they are the fastest and best, even above bitpay and coinbase. we learned this after trying to import our savings to test buy via tiger direct.com 
we started import on coinbase to wait wait wait and joe or joel with customer service told us there was an issue with importing which would be fixed asap. Blockchain and bitcoins were fast and easy...if only we didn't loose .50-1.00 via bitpay rates compared to blockchain or coinbase. either way fast and easy after we got past importing the paper wallet.. millibits would be smart too.
Also maybe offer FREE SHIPPING ON ALL BITCOIN SALES?
Tiger was cheaper for graphic cards and newegg was cheaper for keyboards;)

Simple fix, cancel and reprocess order if the 15 mins is up, you should of read the text which gives you details of this:)

We just did a tiger direct purchase last night missed it and went back and re processed now no issues, except when they ask for feedback or survey why canceled it doesnt give an option for bitcoin payment timeout. however fast and easy just wish we could have option
and we tried coinbase to import the paper wallet however we were unable due to there own issues and then went to blockchain for the rapid processing of import and payment to bit pay:) done first few bitcoin purchase's w my savings
