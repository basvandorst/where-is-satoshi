You would think they would love bitcoin considering that their against rent which is what banks make their money of.

I don't know never played crypto bots. But I would look at how they earn money and how new items are created. 
Yeah I did find it fun but now it really hard to get a profit.

I play cryptokitties and have looked at the code before and i can tell you it's real.
 They only take 3.75% from every sale. But a third party fee less sale contract can be made as well. They do control they fancy trades
 But it doesn't seem like a scam to me

Run your own node with tor do coinjoins buy more with bisq get a faraday-hat and buy some totally legal drugs
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:44:29
Or just make shielded tx with zec
 or maybe monero if you don't like to risk it on bleeding edge cryptography and if you are okay with privacy through obscuration.
Or hell mix your eth with zk snarks on tornado.cash

A see you got confused with eth see because eth is money

Also i like this article it might explain it better then i can: 
However it mostly talks about the consensus stuff and not what Facebook is going to do with it.

Yes the liquidity issue should become less of problem as the network grows!
But i connected to the node im paying to directly with the amount i need to pay and a fair bit extra like 40$ extra. So liquidity shouldn't be a issue according to the faq page of eclair.
So i think there some other bug or error that i encountered
Or maybe eclair tries to do some extra hops anyway to increase privacy. But couldn't find any settings for that and that contradicts the stuff on the faq pages anyway.

Huh that probably means you didn't got the btc back and my theory is false. Only option is that you contact the holder to that adress to let them send it back. 
Because the remainder is probably at the adress you though you already got a automatic refund from. But that refund is just a utxo like i explained.

And bitcoins lightning network is already working and sort of private with node hoping kinda like onion routing style. 
So minus the volatility it can already replace banks.

Yes bitcoin is also a ledger and yes with cpfp you can effect tx outside of the block the cpfp tx is in. But in bitcoin it is in a block. In libra its not.
The definition blockchain comes from the data structure not from its features. 
In libra every transaction is just stored in a list and every tx is hashed together to build a merkle tree and that hash is signed by the validator.
In bitcoin the tx are put in a block and that is signed by the miner together with a hash of the previous block.

Anyway what wallet do you use and what does it say you send and received? Does that add up?
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:37:30
When you make a Bitcoin transaction you have to send the entire balance of that address (this is called UTXO). Usually what happens with wallets is that they send the amount you want to send and send the remaining balance to a other adress  which your wallet generates. So you also own that wallet. (This to increase privacy)
Tldr: the remaining coins are probably in your wallet. But you did lost some in transaction fees

Each channel has 140$ worth of bitcoin so that checks out.

With dai in combination with aztec for private transactions and raiden for scaling. You have can have dollars on the blockchain like a bank but without a bank.
But those technologies aren't matured yet especially raiden en aztec as far as i know. And i dont even know if anyone is working on payment channels with zk snarks tokens.
But yes it wil disrupt banking jp morgan coin proves that. The question is wil decentralized blockchains win from centralized.
And this oc post is is just a ad for bitior btw

From the technical white paper
"The ledger history stores the sequence of committed and executed transactions as well as the asso-
ciated events they emitted. The purpose of the ledger history is to keep a record of how the latest
ledger state was computed. There is no concept of a block of transactions in the ledger history. The
consensus protocol batches transactions into blocks as an optimization and to drive the consensus protocol (see Section 5 for details on consensus). However, in the logical data model, the transactions
occur in sequence without distinction as to which block contained each transaction."
So basically the data structure isn't a blockchain but transaction are batched every 10s in blocks. How ever after they are confirmed you cant tell which block there in.
But it is distributed like a blockchain and can be verified like a blockchain but it isn't a blockchain. But they like to call it a blockchain. 
Also if you want to verify the ledger you need to download the entire thing and calculate its merkle root. In btc and eth you can also only verify block headers.
About proof of stake:
From the paper:
"Initially, the association (and validators) will consist of
a geographically distributed and diverse set of Founding Members. These members are organizations
chosen according to objective participation criteria, including that they have a stake in bootstrapping
the Libra ecosystem and investing resources toward its success. Over time, membership eligibility will
shift to become completely open and based only on the member’s holdings of Libra."
Initially they won't have proof of stake. Instead they wil choose the validators them self based on criteria including paying the fat 10mil as a stake.
How ever the consensus model isn't open yet at launch and not running pos. And I don't know if they have open source code yet because i haven't looked. 
But would be cool to see if they can implement pos because that could be very useful for the development of ethereum. But i  don't know in what timeframe libra wants pos tho.

Wouldn't want the government to put those gmo chemicals in my bitcorns
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:18:35
Libra isn't even a blockchain. Just a database with a signed and versioned merkle root.

My theory is that you already have the coin.  But i dont have the transaction and your wallet so i dont know what happened exactly but it is my best gues
And yes you have that adress and you can spend from it this will happen automatically. 
Let me give a example of how wallets handle addresses:
Lets say you have only received bitcoins once and never have send them: then you wil have 1 adress. 
Now you want to spend half your balance:
So you spend half your balance and because bitcoin requires you to send the entire balance of a adress, you would then send the rest to you self. To do this your wallet generates a new address. 
Now you hold half your original balance on a new address. And because it is a new address someone would need to geuss which adress is yours and which is the recievers.
And when you want to receive your wallet generates a another adress to give you even more privacy
Now lets say you received more bitcoins on a other adress and now have 2 address. And you want to spend all of your bitcoin that you hold. Your wallet is then able to generate a transaction that uses the balance of those to addresses at once. So in your case it means that those funds should be used whenever you your wallet thinks that it need it.
Tldr: so my theory is you don't need to recover your coins you already have them
