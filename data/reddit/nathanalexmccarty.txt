I think you mean [Cyclic redundancy check] (
Cyrillic is an alphabet, and doesn't have much built in redundancy.

The bitcoin protocol doesn't actually let you cash out the value of what an address owns. Say I have a single address X and I send 0.1 BTC to it. Now this address has a balance of 0.1 BTC, but if I want to spend 0.05 BTC, I can't just say "Send 0.05 BTC from address X to address W", I have to say "Take the only transaction that has been sent to address X and send half of its value to address W and the other half to address Y".
In general, address Y is a change address that gets added as a sort of shadow address to your wallet, some clients let you send the change back to the oringal address, but you usually have to enable this by hand.

It depends on which client, but to be safe you should rebackup every time you add new addresses or spend coins, as this behavior will be safe for all reasonably designed clients.

As a casual miner, I'll take three.

No problem, glad to help.

I also seem to remember one being performed on bitcoin's testnet a long time back.

Well, assuming the effective security of a key is 256 bits (which with modern cryptography algorithms it isn't for a key size of 256 bits), to give you a sense of the sheer scale of the magnitude of this number, the number of bits required to give each atom in the sun a unique number is something in the range of 190. So breaking a 190 bit key would be equivalent to doing a computationally intense operation for each atom in the sun, and considering that each additional bit doubles the amount of information present, breaking a 256 bit key would be something on the order of 80 quintillion times harder (8*10^19) than breaking a 190 bit key, this image would seem to contain a fair bit of truth.
