So the private key changes after every transaction?

They're missing the point because they're forgetting that when Bitcoin becomes popular, almost none of the users are going to understand or care how it works.  
This guy is missing an even worse point, imo, where he doesn't see that *someone* does have to care about those things in order for this to work.  Him being an idiot isn't helping improve the system.  Him going into a forum pretty much 100% filled with people worrying about how the backend of this works and complaining that he doesn't care is pretty fucking stupid, and it shows.

When blocks are generated, then, is it private keys that are being generated?

Did not even once mention ignoring end users.  I'm saying it's stupid to try and tell people that are in charge of making sure that it's successful in the first place to not care about details.

Well, pretty much that entire portion of people that care is here, and no one else is.  And you're complaining about it.  
Also, making idiotic comparisons to atoms isn't helping how stupid you look.

What other camp?  A genie?  What are you on?...
The point is that you're assuming no one hear thinks about end-users at all, or that concentrating on the backend precludes you being aware of UX at all.  Why would you ever assume that?...
