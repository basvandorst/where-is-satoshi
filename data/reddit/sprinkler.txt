It is hard to identify specific arguments. For example, from the article, "The BCB enforces the strictest deposit regulations in the world by requiring full reserves for all accounts." The closest analogy, I think, for normal banking is that the "Federal Reserve requires that each US Dollar be worth a full US Dollar." The author's intended analogy is something like "The BCB requires banks to hold 100% of deposits as reserves, whereas the Fed allows 90% of deposits to be lent out" but that is objectively untrue - the BCB is agnostic with regard to what percent of a depositor's balance is lent out.

This. I was typing out basically the same thing when I checked for updates, and you had just posted it.
There's nothing inherently underhanded about fractional reserves. If bitcoin were to become an actual currency in widespread use, people would agree to fractional reserve banking. Some depositors would want interest on their balances.
The only way to stop fractional reserve banking is for the BCB, or the relevant governing body, to send auditors backed by enforcers against any one who operates a fractional reserve bank.
The thing stopping me, or any of you, from opening a bank with demand deposits, interest on balances, and fractional reserves, is the US government.* Any of you could start a bitcoin bank with fractional reserves, and again, only the IRL government would possibly do anything about it. Fractional reserve banking preceded any official recognition of it.
*Might not apply in foreign countries.

Again, it is not a matter of double spending. Here is a hypothetical.
Time 0:
* You deposit 1 bitcoin with my bank
* My bank lends 1 bitcoin in RedditNamesSuck's farm
Time 1:
* RedditNamesSuck pays me 1.1 bitcoins
* I pay you 1.05 bitcoins
Throw in a lot of other details and you get the picture.

And in Scenario 1 you could get a fraction of your deposit back, if your bank fails.
What's the remaining difference?

Like RedditNamesSuck said, it's not double-spend. 
The deeper point you're getting at with the money market fund is that there is an infinite range of financial devices, and there is nothing privileged about the form of fractional reserve banking for consumer bank accounts that we are currently most familiar with. People will think of all sorts of transactions to allocate risk and reward across a hypothetical bitcoin economy. That is actually a criticism of the article, not a defense. The world is not going to follow the author's ideas for how they should be using their bitcoins.

Scenario 1: You deposit 1 bitcoin in a FRB account. They "create new money with a simple ledge entry" by noting your deposit on their books. Later, you get your money, plus interest.
Scenario 2: You give 1 bitcoin to a MMF. They "give a share" by noting you have one share on their books. Later, you get your money, plus interest.

On a high level, there is a risk of conflating commentary on the economic system we know, with what bitcoin could become, which we do not know. Making hard claims about what is not possible for bitcoin is fraught with peril.

FRB opens depositors up to the risk of bank failure. Depositors can choose banks they think are trustworthy. Or buy insurance. Where do you pull "impossible" from?

I do not accept your certainty with regard to the gulf between 100% reserve accounts, and investment vehicles (that are not demand deposits). However, let us assume you are right, and the bitcoin economy will develop in this way. 
The key for my purpose is, you are making an argument based on economic efficiency. You are no longer claiming that the nature of BTC makes FRB impossible. It is merely sub-optimal, so you expect people to avoid it.

Loaning out more than 100 BTC is just fraud, that's not a conversation about FRB any longer. What is it you think a bank does with a $100 deposit?
