Pretty much sounds like they want names assigned to bitcoin addresses so it's easier to track down what bitcoins goto who.

I thought the same thing. I'm not doing it now. Everything seems too clean, their youtube, reddit account, and website are all very new with absolutely no activity. Unless it was trusted by coinbase, or something like that, i wouldn't use it

I usually have a small amout waiting for a good time to sell. I was actually planning on buying something when it came in but i guess i have to wait a bit or buy more.

Hold, maybe it'll spike to the $1000 again ;).

Oh so now he's playing the victim role......he didn't provide a valid sig so why should we believe that he is Satoshi.....

True, but i bought via coonbase and that takes 5 days to come in. Which is friday i think it will be in my account. Plus That $100 has already lost it's value.

I'm bout to cry. I might need therapy. Like.....dude.....time is tough. Nah but i dont really care about loseing about $12 its just the fact that i just set up a order monday and then this happened. If i better placed the order time then i could have saved a few bucks.
