Excellent post. Do both. Diversify, protect yourself and your household, and enjoy those tax free Roth gains.

Hmm, if i understand you right, you wanna invest in something that might go big rather than withdraw fees. Great idea. I'd go to crytocompare.com, sort the BTC page by volume, then look to see which ones are "cheapest" giving you the most "bang for your buck". Then see if any of them are on your exchange bitMEX. This way you invest in something that has a lot of volume, movement, attention in the market. At the end of the day a lot of these crap-coins are just like pink-sheets, penny-stocks, they flash in the pan quick but usually die from inattention.

If you do see him again, after he verified he really does have it, like on blockchain.info etc, then tell him to get a lawyer (that's solicitor for our friends across the pond) because there's all sorts of ways to protect ones investments and lawyers know them all.

Bittrex is USD Tether, whereas GDAX/Coinbase is real USDs.
