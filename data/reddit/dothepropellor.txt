Thankyou for the explanation, makes a bit more sense to me! Question though - What happens if I put my $100 (or whatever) worth of BTC on that chanel for the month but dont actually spend anything that month? 
Does that mean that I get charged $10 (or whatever the fee is) to close the chanel still, therefore costing me $10-30 for having a chanel I never used? 
Would it mean I would have to set up a new chanel again the next month?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:30:31
That sounds very good! If it seriously is like that then I have faith!
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:30:02
OK... thats a bit concerning... the costs of having a chanel open as an option just to have it closed and also from the vendors perspective (mcdonalds in this case) having to wait a significant period of time to collect payment.. it creates a cashflow problem that a lot of businesses, particularly small businesses, couldn't accept. 
It seems a situation of either the chanels wont stay open long enough to be usable in order to maintain cashflow for the businesses (and therefor cost the customer significant fee's or the inconvienience of having to re-establish chanels frequently... which will get old fast) or the chanels stay open long term and the seller (business) suffers cashflow problems from the delay in collecting revenue from closing chanels?

My concern isnt that Lightning wont work as designed, its that Lightning works as designed, but that design isnt actually fixing the existing problem, its just creating a new way to use Bitcoin that will be very practical for some  scenarios but pretty much non relevant to 80% of us.

I wish I had done the same, hold on mate, your losses on BTC wont be nearly as bad as the thourough raping you'll get from the ex when she takes your money - hopefully you  gain like everyone here says and you'll even have some money to pay the blood sucking lawyers.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:54:33
I saw all the writing on the wall you have pointed out here clear as day. I knew it was time to cash out at 19k but I've only been on this train for about 6 months.. still in the HODL mentality. It went against every bit of logic that I had (the same points you made) and I wish I had listened to my own reasoning and done the same as you. I am still very much in the profit zone having bought at 3k, but I figure in for a penny in for a pound now. Wish I had sold at 19k but I'm going to punish myself and ride it to the ground now if thats what it turns out to be. 
But everyone here yelling HODL to an echo chamber is absoloutely asleep at the wheel - the mania that preceeded this was a massive massive red flag. The VerCoin publicity and media pump combined with the massive unanswered problem of transaction fees and times which is undeniable and front and centre of every discussion on any other crypto subs and forums (yet is brushed off here with no actual solution) was another massive red flag (or two).
This is a sinking ship IMO and if I'm lucky, it might bounce back up to 19K sometime soon, but I reckon there is a bunch of people like me who feel exactly as you described - sick of worrying about this shit and sick of denying to themselves the obvious red flags just to fap off with the others in the circlejerk while they HODL eachothers dicks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:02
Couldnt agree more... unfortunately this seems to fall om deaf ears here - everyone pumping lightning, which doesnt actually solve yhe issues of day to day use with one off peers. Lightning isnt going to make buying a cup of coffee easier. setting up a channel for a one off purchase isnt feasable due to time and costs and its probably even in the  too hard basket for regular multiple purchases.. 
second layer solutions are cool and have their place, but they dont solve the problem we have. 
they are seldom adopted (segwit anyone?)
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:27:27
because if this isnt a usable currency as its supposed to be, then the price will drop because no one will use it. also, the transaction times attached to these fees makes it impossible to cash out rapidly if you want to.

The night before I signed up to reddit the PolAir helicopter was circling low over my house at 2am in the morning and woke me up, so I went outside to see what all the fuss was about stark naked and realized they probably had the FliR camera on looking for criminals - so I started to do the 'Do the propeller' dance waving my dick around and around, figured the camera operator would appreciate a bit of wiggles at 2am just as I appreciated their turbine engine :)

I know I feel kinda privileged in a weird way! I am one of those "all or nothing" kinda people. I had to have at least 1 full bitcoin. Sure, it was scary as f*ck handing $5200 cash over to a bank teller and saying "throw it all in this account"  and hoping for the best, but I am somewhat proud to have a full bitcoin there and the .1 for future transaction fees!

You're mostly right in what you say here, but where we disagree is that I say the music industry does manipulate the audience by pushing promotion of someone they are invested in through all their channels - and whilst they might not "kill someone off", they will promote one over the other and build a strong brand out of that. The new strong brand ("artist") in turn serves their purpose and makes them lots of money - often even when the music they start churning out is absolute rubbish. It gets to a point where artists they have heavily invested in will have songs released just because they are who they are, not because that song was any good and they just pump it and pump it until we're all bopping our heads along in collective belief that just because the song gets played on the radio 100 times a day must mean that it's popular with everyone and you better get on board and start loving that new Britney Spears song.

Mate, my thoughts exactly. The other problem I have with these forks is that BOTH forms of coin might (very likely) come out the other side as lesser value. So it not only creates a fork coin of lesser value, but significantly drops the value of the original too. Entity's could manipulate this in large scale to effectively crash a coin.

I've read a number of articles that discuss the fractal nature of bitcoin, all were pre this big jump, and this big jump just supports it in a more 'zoomed out perspective again. I'm no expert, just a total amature watching from the sidelines, but this is an interesting development and I will be watching where it goes. 
If indeed Bitcoin is fractal in its behaviour and the current emerging pattern is the reincarnation of the 2013 fractal pattern, then just imagine where the next big spike is going to go after this one! 
So what I am saying is, it can be a glass half empty glass half full thing depending on your take on it and faith in the reliability of the pattern. If indeed there is a massive plummet down coming as the fractal suggests, then there is an even bigger climb coming on the other side.

@_date: 2017-08-18 21:36:53
I'm starting to think the OP might be right. This sub is full of fanboys and most often hypes bitcoin, but I think someone has to put it out there, this dilution of the coin by forking could potentially lead to a lack of confidence in the whole concept of bitcoin and the perception that so many versions of bitcoin are potentially equiv. to "printing more money" 
I understand the above is not exactly the correct technical outcome of forking, but that is the perception the general public will have and it will result in devaluation of the whole concept of bitcoin. With limitless versions of "Bitcoin" branching off, why would anyone see any security in holding a coin that just branches off to something else at the drop of a hat?

Coinbase is but one fish in a big pond. There are literally a million other ways (e.g. individual p2p tx) to send bitcoin to anyone you like, including white nationalists, if that's your thing. Coinbase have a whole lot of other rules a d regulations that not everyone in the bitcoin community see as ideal either - but that's the great thing about Bitcoin, there are always other options and ways around.

And this is hypothetical of course, but if there were 100,000 versions of bitcoin released in quick succession, all with the bitcoin name, what is to say any one of them is worth jack schitt? Everyone just received 100,000 new coins and value is based of bitcoin - market diluted. Downvote me to hell if I'm wrong, but this seems to be a major major problem to me.

I have voiced this on a few other threads too - and I fear this will kill bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. It's an artificial means of inflation in a sense. Yes there are serious differences in genuine inflation and fork inflation but it is effectively doing the same thing - diluting the market with multiple versions of the same thing. You have articulated it better than I can right now - but there seem to be a lot of people in denial about this. It's not just a river in Egypt folks.

@_date: 2017-09-10 21:25:19
Start off with 100 then buy one more each day otherwise it's pointless

Place your order on their site, they send you an email with the total amount to deposit, the account details and instructions - you need to deposit folding cash into their account, they don't accept electronic transfers (it's kinda freaky dropping 5k cash into some account and hoping for the best Hahaha!)... they call you within minutes of making the deposit and verify that it's you, remind you to email the photo of you holding your ID and the deposit slip and you have your BTC sent pretty much immediately. It's pretty straight forward and the extra costs aside, I've been happy with all my dealings with them so far
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:18:32
Thanks :)

Flash the firmware (it should do this automatically on setup) and realistically it should be fine. You could return it of course, but honestly from what I've read, it's highly unlikely you will have a problem once you flash the firmware

I'd help but I don't have Google wallet and I'm in Australia. Is PayPal an option? Needless to say, be super careful - you are leaving yourself way open to getting scammed :(

I bought from bitcoin.com.au - I found that like most exchanges, you pay a significant fee in differences of exchange prices and commission, about AUD $300 of top of the actual price... so hefty - but they are based in Melbourne, had fast, effective service (had my bitcoin in my Trezor within 1hr of depositing the funds) and there was actual people to get in contact with who I could speak to on the phone, immediately. 
The process was simple and I was able to buy up to $8000 worth at a time. 
Edit: I bought 1.1 BTC off them first up, exchange rate was @ USD $3400, I payed AUD $5200 all said and done. Bought another .1BTC off them a week or two later, exchange rates had changed significantly by then (BTC dramatically climbed) and that cost me about AUD $680 I think.
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:23:18
I'm thinking it's not a correction, it was a speed bump from the Chinese announcement. Merely a bump in the road. It's typical bitcoin. Textbook bitcoin. Shit happens, soldier on!

Also, if someone did hack bitcoin it would be worthless meaning the hack would be pointless.

Obviously but where in Aus?

I agree with OP, you're living in fairyland if you think China isn't going to keep manipulating Bitcoin in its grasp

I've gotta say, it goes against the intention of bitcoin to not be able to buy bitcoin at any age. Bitcoin is for everyone, not just adults. It's a currency, there is no law against a minor holding fiat currency, why should there be restrictions holding minors back from holding bitcoin too? It's a big problem and it's not helping bitcoin in the journey towards mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:27:09
Personally I think S2X is going to cause the destruction of both coins. It will cause so much chaos with the uneducated by it's lack of replay protection - people will lose coins and buy into the wrong chain etc and essentially get a bad taste of the whole thing and say "fuck it, bitcoin self imploded" 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:39:07

Crash bitcoin prices with a massive sell off... leave it in his will so it can only be accessed when he's dead (if he isn't already) so it won't matter that he is identified by the transaction.

Well let's start with the obvious one - how much btc do you have? 
What is the total value of your wealth? 
Not asking to be a smart ass but trying to gain perspective on exactly what those figures you've quoted mean :)

They are also running an active promotion/education/awareness/tipping campaign in - check out the comments threads on most of the girls posts. They tell them they should take BCH and then link them to an informational site then send a very small BCH tip.
That's some pretty crazy lengths they are going to.

As for banks creating their own coin, their own coin is not bitcoin, it's subject to all the variables that bitcoin specifically is designed to get away from. Meh, let them do it, I am seeing more positives than negatives from it at this point.
