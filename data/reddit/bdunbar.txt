Ah - wrong hosting.  Thanks.
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:01:57


I hope to make a living hosting OB servers.  How would you do that?
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:00:53
I've been knocking around the OB projects since Thanksgiving, 2015. As far as I know it's never relied on a single server.  Your source?
@_date: 2016-08-18 10:54:18
Ah - libbitcoin.
Valid comment - I didn't downvote you.

I’d used online services (compuserve, bbs) worked as a junior admin for corporate networks then. I’d dabbled with the pre web internet. No way, I thought, could ‘the internet’ be the future. 
I was a little wrong. But I can’t blame my younger self: he hadn’t learned that open brats closed.

Good news! 768k day blew by largely unnoticed back in April.
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:34:59
Why? It’s the ultimate prank.

You are holding the same view as the condemned man who blamed carpenters for building the gallows.

Clearly we are talking from different zipcodes, about different sports.  Be well.

Lawyers are just people, doing a job that needs to be done. Without them we’d be more at the mercy of the state than we are.
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:01:38
@_date: 2019-11-09 12:36:38
Not at all. The state is making laws: that is what a state does. You need lawyers to help you navigate those laws and stay on the right side of them. 
Fewer lawyers makes them more expensive to use.

Naw. I had the same reaction a few years ago.
Mom kept my old C64 for whatever reason. I pulled it down from the closet and thought 'That's \*it\*? No way.'
And I learned basic on that thing.
Edit: I didn't have the fancy cassette loader or anything.  We weren't \*rich\*. It was all floppy drives and punching in code by hand.

That model the CPU and keyboard were mated together.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:04:04
Complicated: one would have to tunnel UDP.
Ninja Edit: but that's how the internet works, now.  It's not a great system, but it works okay.

In the current version if the computer running the store is offline, the content is not available.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:08:00
Sounds like an opportunity to introduce rate-limiting in the protocol.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:41:13


From what I can see, there is no way a fee _can_ be charged.

The cops can track you down by your IP address.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:32:47
A requirement for anonymous p2p is not helpful for widespread adoption, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:44:18
You say that.
I've seen people - business - go around happily not having any backup for email, code, websites.
It doesn't strain credulity to imagine a small business owner not backing up a quickbooks file.

True enough that it's the way to bet.
Edit: there is a moderator role envisioned: either party can contest the contact through a 3rd.

Anything you want subject to the laws where you are.
@_date: 2016-02-18 23:13:08
I believe it can.  Hit up their Slack channel - they can probably answer questions you'll have.

I'm old, and so I remember people (including me) saying similar things about going on line using CompuServe over 'the interent'.
Cheap and open wins over expensive and closed.

Lighting Backup As A Service (LBAAS) - I like it. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 17:50:47


I don't think it is.
It is, however, way easier than running any ecommerce software I'm aware of.
But it is censor resistant in that there is no one to kick you off the OpenBazaar network.

When my wife launched her curio shop, some months the difference between red and black was setting up a table at those real-life flea markets.

My step-daughter is a good use-case.
She wants to make a living buying and selling niche items.
She has done this on ebay, but finds their fees and so on onerous.
She's dabbled in OB, and likes what she sees, and the potential for what it could be.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:08:43
Would that be for your nodes or other peoples nodes?

People in the rental business, not being stupid, invented the ‘deposit’. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:18:23
I should have wrapped that comment with humor brackets, but thanks for replying politely.
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:24:29


Your analogy is suspect: by no stretch has IM obsoleted, or replaced, email.

I've installed Bazaar Hound on my Android - it works well.

mit-dci/lit ?  Last commit was February 5 - is it still active?

Something like Laura Shin's weekliy podcast 'Unconfirmed'? 
Just the news would be great.
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:03:01
A: Is that a crypto mining facility?
B: What? No, just a plain ol server farm. Email and files. No crypto whoozita here!
A: Oh, my bad.

It's funny because you can substitute any language for 'C' and it can be accurate.

Surprising but .. maybe not? He's 62. He's incredibly rich.  He's been a biz guy for a long time now - I bet he could still code but I doubt he's had the time to do any hacking for more than a decade.

That a server has /any/ GUI by default is crazy. 
After I got over the way it looked, it's a perfectly ok way to mouse around on a server.

How rich are we talking about?  
Low end: pay off the house, make sure retirement is taken care of, keep working. 
High end: turn the wealthy into a charity foundation.  Pay myself and my family a million a year salary.  The fund doles out investment profits as charity. 
The upside to this is everyone will always laugh at my jokes. I guess the downside is I know they don’t mean it.
