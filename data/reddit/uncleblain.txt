I can genuinely say that under the influence of LSD, I’m happy; truly happy.

Explaining LSD is like explaining a color.Just gotta experience it. But my god, it’s the most beautiful drug I’ve ever done in my entire life. Life is beautiful during that high. Wow. Package gonna take about a week to arrive, wish me luck until then.

You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:05:44
Because I like drugs.

16 here as well. Got about 2000 into it. I bought heavily back when it was in the low 2000s price range and I'm in some serious profit. Won't sell till we get to the moon!

Buy drugs with it and then sell them. Ez profit.

It feels like your a little kid again; exploring a whole new world and experience intense emotions. The world is vivid, bright, and beautiful. You feel life around you existing and you truly feel like you are spiritually connected with the world. 
10/10 would recommend.

Buy in bulk when you do buy.

No problem man, much love! (:

Likely keep it, since I have 2 sheets coming to my, and won't need any for a long time. But I don't need any BTC, you seem responsible and logical; unlike me. HODL that fifty and turn it into 500 (: 
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:09:14
It's irresistible haha (:
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:12:58
At the end of the day, I can honestly say it is. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:34:46
Spent it all on LSD. Did you read the title? ;)
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:30:22
Lmfao sorry man. Pretty high (; 
You get my point though lol
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:27:20
Yes both, it will minimize fees by a lot if say you bought 200 BTC a month at one time instead of say 50 dollars a week. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:49:00
20 times give or take a few.

That is a risk I'm willing to take for the clarity LSD brings me (:
However, you are right, LSD can cause people who eventually will get schizophrenia to have it sooner. Not sure if I'm 100% correct, but I have heard something like that. LSD isn't a toy or some fun party drug, and I am aware of that. It is something very special in my life and I am willing to take risks to be able to experience it.
