Let this incompetent lying idiot (Brian Armstrong) fall through into the tartar !! (or at least will be dismissed as soon as possible!)
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:50:02
Absolutely!! I fully agree with the author 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:47:24
It will. I know what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:01:33
Sorry, i haven't quite understood what you meant to say. The man did pay in time , and yet the shop rejected his payment for a timeout reason. That's absolutely insane 
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:11:55
BTC (Bitcoin Core from bitcoin.ORG as the main wallet application) is the only REAL, TRUE Bitcoin. I know what I'm saying
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:15:37
You are absolutely right! I fully SUPPORT and AGREE with your proposal! I almost hate those lousy bcash, Bitmain, stupid and dangerous 2x-ers, like the idiots from the bitpay
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:43:13
Yes, bittrex has been more and more shifting to being just an ordinary lousy scammer
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:09:24
That's why centralization is the enemy of freedom and cryptoes as well! Not for nothing did bitpay / copay fervently support the disgusting "Segwit2x". And this is exactly what is disgusting in the Roger Ver's lousy Bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:41:15
True! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:00:02
I'd say it in this way:  it had always been too HARD to make money (before the great Bitcoin era). And don't think it is so simple to HOLD - many many people are unable to HOLD, and will soon sell them to get some 'real' money (while doing actually the exact opposite - selling REAL money for some fake ones). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:11
Absolutely true wise words! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:22:19
I fully AGREE!! This is a very wise, correct, accurate advice!! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:48:46
God damn those lousy scammers!!     I, too, was once fooled by an ugly fake mining equipment shop. I sympathize with you with all my heart!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:39:53
Not bad as well:)
Yet It's only the beginning!
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:45:15
First of all, I suggested to NOT keep any serious sums at the always online wallet. Second, then, there's no any actual danger - just install main security updates for the OS used, and activate firewall on his/her router and/or OS itself.
My full node (on my laptop) has been running for several months without any troubles at all
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:53:10
A great analogy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:21:41
If that's the case, then it's certainly quite another matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:34:28
A great detailed review! Thank you very much! 
Personally I am a fan of the Electrum wallet (both Android and windows versions). For exchanging the True Bitcoin (BTC) various forks (like Bcash, Bgold, etc.) I also use the pretty good Coinomi wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:46:37
Absolutely true! Great post. 
I also have been running my own full node since July this year! 
I STRONGLY ASK and recommend everyone do run his own Bitcoin Core full node as well! It is not so difficult!
Just go to  download the wallet application and do it!
(and by the way, you may even not keep any coins in the wallet! (or keep a very small amount in it, while keeping your real coins in a Cold storage, or a hardware Ledger wallet). 
The most important is that you just let it be running and online as much time as you can afford it. 
You will then help the great True Bitcoin (BTC) community!! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:03:13
Because bcash-ers headed to just increase the size of the block, which:
1) will inevitably lead to a constant increase in centralization, since due to a significant increase in the requirements for equipment fewer people will be able to support full nodes.
2) will NOT and NEVER actually resolve any scaling problems (which, for example, the lightning network and segwit do resolve)
3) they just try to harm the TRUE  Bitcoin (BTC) , split the community, confuse and mislead users
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:49:37
Well done! Running one's own Full Bitcoin Core node is extremely important for health of the great Bitcoin community! I've been running mine since July 2017. By the way, I don't keep any coins in my full node's wallet at all! (all are in my Cold storage). I'm running my node (24/7) just to help the great True Bitcoin (BTC) network and to increase safety for my own coins as well, as I fully realize how important it is there were as much as possible Full Bitcoin Core nodes! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:24:52
All article's fine except point 9:  I think (I wish) much LESS volatility!! Volatility is all those traders' (speculators') friend - NOT Bitcoin's (and our, HODLers') friend!
I'm sure BEST would be SLOW, yet STEADY GROWTH!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:10:20
Once again, increasing block size is NOT a solution, it does NOT resolve any difficulties at all: using your highway analogy, it is as if building more and more new lanes for the old road instead of using (inventing) planes, railways, or building other (newer and better) highways to resolve the older highway difficulties. It just ADDs ANOTHER trouble - splitting and misleading, creating false fake phishing  sites like bitcoin.com which is lying it is of the true Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:11:01
I replied above 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:58
GOD damn bcash, Roger Ver, and all its supporters. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:32:01
The vile stupid bcash-ers are nothing and nobody else but sneaky scammers. They've been trying to sneakily substitute the TRUE Real decentralized Bitcoin (BTC) with their fake worthless imitation (BCH). I know what I am saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:56:33
I'd strongly recommend you using, for example, the Electrum wallet in a Cold storage scheme instead of any exchanges, see details here: 
 That scheme is very safe
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:55:43
That 15-minute countdown is just a kind of outrageous nonsense! They must have given a 3-12 hours even for the first confirmation for their customers if they are sane at all
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:27:19
I'd strongly advice everyone NOT to have anything to do with those lousy bcash, bitcoin.Com and it's wallet (the TRUE Bitcoin home is bitcoin.ORG!!), bitpay, copay, Bitmain, Roger ver, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:41:51
I'm absolutely sure HODL is the BEST, wisest, really working strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:10:01
God damn all of  those lousy vile bcash supporters, I just cannot find other words for them
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:33:50
Bittrex TOO OFTEN behaves and looks like a scammer. Not answering support tickets has become quite typical as well.
Look r/Bittrex - there're hundreds of similar complaints!
I'd say if something looks like and behaves like a scammer, then it may actually be a scammer indeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:30:28
The great, wise, merciful Lord has heard our prayers!!
I had been so much suffering because of of the terrible destructive chain split threat!! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:09:21
Absolutely true. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:59:29
I mean it overall goes steady up, while of course falling back seriously sometimes 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:32
Maybe! Those bcash-ers are pretty mean.
They may use any dirty tricks :(
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:59:43
God damn (sorry) those ugly lousy BCH, Roger Ver, Bitmain, etc. I just HATE them all. 
I just have no other words for what they've been doing 
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:15:56
Of course, but that's not a problem at all. No one, nothing can stop the Bitcoin and other crypto currencies from the gradual  but steady growth 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:26:53
You, like them all who I mentioned above, you ARE LYING as you always do. 
And as always you are again attacking the REAL bitcoin. 
But as always, you'll FAIL. I promise. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:37:05
Absolutely true. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:16:04
If this is true we MUST put the Bitpay itself on the permanent blacklist!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:14:20
Absolutely! 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:13:20
There'll be almost NO growth in network performance due to the fact that the Segwit Bitcoin network improvement protocol has already been activated this summer, and it already includes, in fact, Block size increasing up to 4 Mb as well. 
Besides, the more popular becomes the Segwit actual usage, the more speed, winning performance and low transactions cost it will provide for Bitcoin network!
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:00:07
Excellent. Well done!
Go on, and let it be online as much as you can afford!
It'd be even better if your node actually accepts incoming connections on 8333 port. (may check it at 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:22:31
Good. As for me, I set up UPnP on my router and enabled it in Bitcoin Core settings 
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:22:30
Perhaps I could have expressed my thought better.
Not so much I wanted to say that 2Mb blocks are completely unnecessary, as I wanted to convey the idea that the method that 2x supporters have chosen (brutal violence, imposing instead of consensus and cooperating, and as result the division of the blockchain) - their method is absolutely not worth that insignificant performance growth, that those 2Mb blocks provide 
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:48:26
I'd suggest stop moving coins 2-3 days before and at least 1-2 weeks after
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:43:06
Sometimes True Bitcoin blocks are being mined slower than usual nowadays due to temporary switching to that (silly) bcash mining.
Don't worry, just wait for a while 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:08:48
Bcash has nothing to do with B2x fork. Those are totally different cases. Bcash was openly, honestly declared as an altcoin, whilst b2x fork just wants to forcibly grab, steal the real Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:34:54
To buy any expensive things - cars, apartments and all like that. 
Bitcoin is real money, best means of savings, in my opinion, unlike fiat
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:03:45
You are doing the right way. Personally, I run my full node with an empty wallet (I keep money in cold storage), so I think I may safely run the usual GUI version, I like to monitor its activities through the Debug window 
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:37:19
Where did you order your Bitcoin? What wallet do you use? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:23:42
Exactly. I think we can name their method that way. Why not? They just gathered together, and with their small group they made such a decision, and they have been  now trying to impose it on the whole community 
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:40:27
For that reason, personally, I don't use the daemon, I just launch the usual (GUI) version, then I usually go to the main menu, then I launch the Debug window.
There are different tabs there with all the useful infos
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:39:15
Yes, I'd suggest to wait a week at least, maybe wait till your wallet application be updated
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:28:12
Why the hell (sorry) do you buy such serious matters, as Bitcoin wallet!!- NOT directly, exclusively from the manufacturer or its official (mentioned in the official site) resellers???
I would have never bought Bitcoin hardware wallet at amazon, or ebay, or something like that! 
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:11:42
Those stupid, spiteful, envious bcashers (incl. some hidden ones like the coinmarketcap) just cannot admit the truth: there has always been and will always be only one REAL Bitcoin - and that is BTC. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:37:37
Of course! (if you a smart individual
