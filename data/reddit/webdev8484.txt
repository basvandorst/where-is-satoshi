Quick everyone downvote this and pretend like it's not happening!

Isn't this the exchange which was meant to be open source and got a ton of donations and support and then switched to private and closed source?

Of course. That is just stating the obvious.
I'm just reminding you all that finding an address that hasn't had coins moved from it in 2 years doesn't necessarily mean it's still in mtgox's ownership, as everyone seems to be assuming.

Ripple creator Jed has gone on record saying XRP becoming valuable and them holding a lot of Ripple is their business model for proitability.
And the only reason why they aren't more open about XRP being potentially used a currency is because they knew if they touted it as such it would receive sterner resistance from Bitcoiners

In your first sentence you said all XRP's will be given away, which is something I contradict.
And nowhere do I imply in my posts the devs shouldn't be rewarded at all for their efforts, so keep beating that dead horse all you like.
Furthermore, assertions from yourself that XRP will never be used as a currency don't hold water with me when I have read from the developers themselves that they admit it's a possibility. In fact, you'll notice the more you read about Ripple the more uncertainty you find. Notice also, they don't specify how much of those 80 *billion* XRP they have awarded themselves will be given away and how much will be their profit for their business model.
And on a separate concluding note, remember this is the Bitcoin subforum. Bitcoin is based upon the principles of open source, decentralisation and non-profit driven behaviour (hence no business model). Naturally a significant proportion of Bitcoiners will compare Ripple in an unfavourable light.

Oh yeah? Funny because Jed, the guy behind Ripple, has said this:
How OpenCoin will monetize XRP
Vinnie: ...What's the OpenCoin business model? 
Jed: ...we hold xrp and hopefully they gain value
Are you really sure Ripple's won't ever serve as a currency and they will all be given away over time? Sounds like they are something of value that will fund the project according to Jed the creator. Are you sure you know better than the creator?

The ripple foundation decided to give themselves 80% of the entire coin supply when it launched.
Sounds like a scam to me.
I'll wait until someone fairly open sources the idea in the spirit of Satoshi et al without giving themselves all the coins.
*Editing in my reponse to im14 so everyone sees it:
