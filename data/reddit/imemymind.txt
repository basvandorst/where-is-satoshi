Are you the same developer that suggested to use OP_RETURN for SPV wallet to decide what fee is the current rate? 
That's extremely dumb, just maybe, just maybe, what you think about block size is also dumb.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:06:11
Do you really need an explaination?
Some miners using OP_RETURN can't be trusted, they can fake numbers and you wouldn't know.
You don't get that a bigger block size means that almost nobody will find it practical to run a node, your toastwallet will have to talk to some sybil node and get screwed, notwithstanding the fact that Mike is acting as a terrorist that wants to break bitcoin no matter what with centralized checkpoints.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:39:29
Are you saying that you prefer people to pay cheaply to use bitcoin at cost of more centralization?
I saw the simulation and Gavin's were like nursery kids level, didn't account for different connectivity, just poor form.
The new ones from Sipa are clearly refined and are already showing Gavin wrong.

Are you saying that your service doesn't protect about classic replace by fee as currently run by some miners?
Should that be the case .... does it even matter that the modified replace by fee doesn't disrupt your service when miners are and will always be free to run the classic replace by fee as some of them are already doing?

I like blockchain, in particular in the early days, but the two factor is not per transaction is per login and they reuse the same address. It's 'ok' but could be better.
A multi-key HD wallet is much better if one wants a web wallet otherwise there is electrum, bitcoin-qt and a bunch of others (including apps for Android).

one of the two keys is encrypted in the user browser (in javascript) with a user selected password
not exactly hard to crack once either some hacker gets access to it or some evil insider does it

Both because of privacy and because once you have signed a tx for any unspent output that was sent to a address (i.e. once you "spend from it" and with the standard client you can't easily control how it chooses which unspent outputs to "spend from") then you have "released" your "public key" (prior to that only the Base58 encoded RIPEMD hash of it was publicly known - also known as the "address").
Now if the ECDSA that Bitcoin uses ever becomes found to be "crackable" then the "private key" to your "address" could be feasibly be cracked and any "remaining" unspent outputs to that address could now be spent by the cracker.

Just like you are used by BC.i solely for publicity after a long period waiting OP decided to use your own publicity to speed up the responsable disclosure and you whine as if this is unjust: perhaps you should be less incompetent and get your team together.

@_date: 2014-04-16 21:28:37
Did you think this properly?
Do you realize some pools don't accept zero fee transactions in mempool and some other pools don't accept spammish betting/gambling sites transactions in mempool?
With or without bitundo all I have to do is send you first a transaction with zero fee and within the same transaction send a tiny bet to one of the gambling site.
I understand at least Eligius and another pool won't touch this TX.Then I send to these pools my new tx (a double spend) with a good fee and no gambling bet and I should have around 10% chances of double spend, even if I submit my second tx a good 30 seconds after the first: they don't have the previous tx in mempool so they won't mark it as invalid and will be a candidate for block inclusion, AFAIK.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:17:50
If you want an online wallet I suggest you use one of the new multi-sig !
* [BitGo](
* [Bitalo](
* [GreenAddress.it](
the last one has a testnet version too if you want to try with the testnet faucet.
Otherwise electrum is great!
EDIT: Added list of multi-sig I know
@_date: 2014-04-16 23:42:29
The model is the same as a local app like electrum or bitcoin-qt, the keys are kept encrypted until a transaction occurs at which point malware has potentially access to them and it's game over and as far as I understand most computers have some kind of malware or another installed and are not up to date.
I would say that models like the new multisignature wallets, see bitgo and greenaddress and the others like that offer a much better security model, at least for common folks, but maybe that's just me.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:31:41

IMHO that's not the worst. I don't like the false sense of security with the login via google auth as not so obviously for everybody once you logged in viruses can steal the key requiring no further google auth to spend funds.
It almost makes Bitstamp  (which holds all the keys) better as at least theirs is per transaction with extra email.
 
Multisignature wallets and hardware wallets should improve the situation.

Roger has done terrible things with privacy exposing people from bc.i accounts.
John seems to be a scammer.

If you look there is no pull request for Circle, like, ever.

Even if it works once out of 20 there may be ways that make it profitable, like satoshidice moving from 0 confs to 1 conf.

colored coins! yay!
- Do you offer per transaction two factor?
- Do you use BIP0032 so that my privacy is preserved?
- Do you store keys on your servers? Encrypted like blockchain? If so, aren't those crackable with bruteforce should your site get hacked? 
- What measures have you designed such that when your server will get hacked you have limited damages?
- Have you thought about using how to prevent these colored coins from being spent accidentally in a normal bitcoin wallet?
- Aren't web clients generally an issue, particularly if the two factor is only for login? If so, do you plan to offer an open source client I can run on my computer?

I fail to see mentioned that as long as some malware has root/administrator capabilities it can steal the keys when you decrypt them, both with a local wallet and with hybrid wallets like Blockchain.info
I also don't see much talk about 'multisig' or '2fa' and you while you mentioned deterministic you don't mention BIP0032 or HD wallets or P2SH, is it in a later non published chapter?
Do you state anywhere that reuse of addresses is bad? Couldn't find that either.
Is it just me or it seems this book has a bit of a conflict of interest with blockchain.info? Why would you recommend web wallets when bitcoin developers discourage it?
Why also no mention of hardware wallets?

For what is worth, I tried both and they are different products and each comes with pros and cons and it's up to you to pick your features/security trade off
I prefer GreenAddress: good support, they are very active and they have been updating their app with some cool new stuff every other week but what I really like about them is that they seem to be listening to the community and devs suggestions
This in contrast with [Will from BitGo that has been MIA for about a month ]( and is not very community friendly especially with open source or patents :(

I don't see how someone can do a MITM just by being on my WiFI or even at my ISP.
The attacker would need to use a valid certificate and from a user POV it would not be any worse than using any browser like chrome, firefox, opera, internet explorer.
If you managed to get a CA to sign any certificate you want you got better to do than hacking some android users: you can hack all browser users!

A hacker compromising BitGo has one key available and can try to brute force the user given password  (read: often very low entropy, seldomly randomly generated) encrypting the second private key held by BitGo
The hacker doesn't even have to do that, he can change the javascript going to the browser to steal keys nullifying the multisig
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:15:01
it has all to do with it, the bad random number generator only affected people spending more than once from the same address, or in other words, reusing addresses or sending change to the same address, or reusing paper wallets, it's all the same.
I guess you decided it is not a problem and that you don't care about privacy, that's fine and dandy, go for it, but don't complain when you get burned.

@_date: 2014-04-16 23:58:59
I think that if you have a pool on your side with X% of hashing rate you have X% chances of pulling a double spend.
If the original transaction has zero fees, you may have even higher chances.
If the original transaction also has some outputs to gambling, this further reduce the pool of miners that would include the tx, further increasing your chances.
Unless I got something wrong somewhere :)

@_date: 2014-03-08 16:13:51
Coinbase runs a wallet where you don't really have control at all, they could in theory pull an mtgox or have some reserve system. 
They probably have decent cold wallet procedures, I don't know, for sure you don't have access if they go down or fully get hacked.
Blockchain can't (unless you are logged in?) but they save your ONE key encrypted on their servers with your user password which could be very weak and the two factor is not per transaction which worries me.
On the other hand, if you want to suggest some native client or paper wallet then you are the only one in charge.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:32:20

No, I don't like it.
It suggests sending change back to paper wallets is a good idea when it isn't.
It uses a shitty licence that is not truly open source, it relies on a centralized server for no good reason, it has that confirmation monitor which is obviously a great false sense of security, etc.

How do you get companies to do anything? Complaining.
We need to have users complain about fees and confirmation times before channels are implemented by wallet software.
Most of what's needed is already implemented on GitHub and requires relatively little work to be used in the real world.
By increasing the block size we can't but slow down the process of adoption of what effectively is the only chance for bitcoin to scale as increasing the block size alone is not enough to go forward to visa levels
a lot of transactions come from gambling which are mostly repeated transaction which could move off to payment channels quite neatly

You understand that if consensus is not possible this effectively means a hard fork with multiple parallel blockchains!
The panic! Another world of pain compared to some people being reprioritsed based on transaction fees.
Why not wait for the new changes in bitcoin core to have effect and see how they work on 1MB?
We could meanwhile work on LN and we can always have a small and more modest increase of 2MB ready for emergencies/crisis.
Obviously we hope we won't even need it and then plan to have a better block increase solution that is UTXO adjusted/friendly _with_ consensus?

Gavin may have financial interest but it may simply be a proud person that underestimated the problem and has already committed to a solution and has to save face.
Coinbase people are very interested in increasing the block size for more than one reason.
In general anyone without the motivation to look into the problem is convinced this is the way to go.
Most users and average developers and average businesses want some scalability solution and believe this is *THE WAY*

Or even better, arrange sand in a mono dimentional pattern.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:06:31
If you want to use someone's fork this is great and a freedom you have but reality seems to be that a fork is dangerous and we should do something about the block size but be very careful and when the majority of the contributors agree that it is not the right time yet why do you appeal to authority (Gavin) and think he knows best?
In his last blog post he just admitted that just maybe he should consider it a bit more.
Bitcoin development has always worked with consensus, ACKs and NACKs and it appears the one underming the team here was Gavin when he considered forking.
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:34:29
... Asking?
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:51:34
The *real* problem here is that Gavin decided to skip the consensus part of Bitcoin and go talk to the public, including businesses, about his solution as if it is a done deal. Mike has done the exact same thing. Yet there is not even a BIP about the block chain size.
The public likes a solution to scale bitcoin and assumes Gavin knows what he is doing but changes such as this have consequences and as Luke-Jr says it is all just a _workaround_ not really what would make Bitcoin scale. To scale we need something else and at the moment LN appears to be one of the candidates.
Imagine if Gavin suggested to change the PoW from sha256 to some asic "resistant" claiming it would make Bitcoin more decentralized what do you think the public would say if not Great Idea TM?
Too bad the public would miss that nothing is 100% asic resistant and that such a move would only decrease the security of the blockchain and that anyhow we are quickly approaching the limit for sha256 hashing thus making it commodity again like GPUs are.
Gavin, why do I feel you are acting like a modern politician, one that thinks only short term?
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:02:31
We do see the occasional 1MB block and with the limit moved to 20MB there is no reason to believe someone (biggest miner?) won't try to create lots of transactions and disrupt the smaller miners. 
The hard fork alone to change the limit is a change that has no meaningful consensus so this may mean bitcoin splits in two or more parallel blockchains which could be devastating.

I seriously think that if you want higher security for withdrawing big amounts (which is totally fine) you should not allow me to deposit those funds and for Paypal is easy to just not allow a payment if the recipient is not authorized to receive such large payments.
In this case the recipient can then agree with the payer another solution.
If paypal allows the payment then i'm forced to provide documents I may not have getting the funds stuck in limbo forever.

Fuck this attitude.
Why is Paypal allowing him to have an account that can receive these amounts if he can't then withdraw?
You do realize that this is a scumbag way of doing business? It doesn't make sense to allow someone to receive funds if they are not allowed to withdraw it, this feels like a way to defraud the ones that don't have access to these 'proofs' which evidently can be faked in no time if OP managed to get some fake bill.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:53:54

@_date: 2015-05-26 20:09:40
No one really thinks the block size should never be raised.
Most core developers just believe it is too early to raise it or that anyhow more work needs to be done before it's the right thing to do. One or two think it should be raised as soon as possible.
Some think that a smaller one may be better/ideal _right_now_ but that doesn't mean they think it should never be increased. Greg said he wouldn't seriously go and try to decrease the block size, in fact, he was hoping that the latest round of changes in bitcoin core should be able to better handle full 1MB blocks.
I hear often people saying that Peter Todd's beliefs on the block sizes are due to his interest in alt coins, like Viacoin or Omni, and I have heard the same about Blockstream founders and sidechains.
Every.Single.Time. it was someone that knew nothing at all about these people contributions and, worse, often they don't even know how many core developers there are or who they are. 
They know Gavin because he is the core developer with the most public face on MSM and bitcoin related media, interviewed all over the place and old "guard" at the bitcoin foundation but many don't know that Mike and Gavin have been consulting for large bitcoin companies that are effectively heavily encouraging block size increases with little care.
Worrisome that people are capable and prepared to make bitcoin work at all costs like visa while others try to improve on bitcoin while maintaining bitcoin fundamental decentralisation.

No, is very simple, you don't allow someone to receive a payment of size X if you don't want to allow them to withdraw it for whatever fraud prevention. You just don't allow the inbound payment.

you can use that + LN to solve most of the scalability issue and only increase the block size when it becomes a bottleneck for LN and payment channels
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:09:52
There are a lot of transactions on the network that would move to payment channels or some other form of offchain transactions should there be a fee market.
It is inevitable that they do and increasing the block size doesn't provide any incentive to work on real solutions like payment channels, p2p hubs, lightening network and other offchain options.
At best it buys time at a huge risk of forks, centralization, it moves the problem to a little later so to speak and maybe that's how Google works but Bitcoin is a very different beast with a decentralized nature.

Everyone knows this, the most interesting thing, if you look closely, is the messenger. 
This post was submitted on 13 Dec 2013, which it's interesting cause it has twice the lucky/unlucky number 13, neutralizing it.
Furthermore, if we translate Dec in binary you get:
01000100 01100101 01100011
However you can see some link between binary, decimal and hex:
 
hex version 44 65 63
and the decimal version 68 101 99
Notice how the 101 is a pattern that can be found in the binary version ?
And so Is the 6, twice, for a total of 666.
This is proof that the message was brought by the devil himself - Bitcoin is to stay and it will mean for us inferno!

Uhm, if at any point in time I would have put between 1% and 30% of my worth I would put in any other digital currency other than Bitcoin less than 0.1%
At this time only btc and nothing else.
If by digital you mean dollary/euro (given that only 7/10% are printed and the rest is digital bits) then unfortunately I do have some fiat as I currently need it to get by.
What I'm trying to say is that I do not approve of litecoin, primecoin or any other bitcoin clone for anything other than "testing" since in the foss world if anything better is available software adopts and it is far easier to make bitcoin upgrade to some algo than to make a cryptocurrency take over bitcoin.

You could make a private sub where to join you have to provide proof (signed message) to have at least 50$ worth in btc.

bitcoin is a great way to escape usd and euro or event gdb and francs.
The real good thing to do is to diversify I imagine, gold, silver, bitcoins, land, etc).
How is the euro a good thing ? it's a failed implementation of a european common currency.
the european central bank doesn't respond to the respective countries but instead responds to private interests that are not sovereign yet control the currency.
The people need to take the failed banks and make them part of the state and create a new currency.

It's also clear that once a chain or two start accepting bitcoin it won't take long before everyone does.

That graph is right only in the sense that a broken 24 clock is right once a day or in fact, worst than that in that like death it applies to everything and everyone and that includes bitcoin, gold, the usd and what not and it doesn't really add any value in modeling bitcoin growth as the timelines are all but accurate.

- Use different OS (linux yes but also freebsd or even minix or embedded)
- Keep keys encrypted at all times minus the amount of time needed to do the signatures
- Only do the signatures on this box
- Keep the box offline, no wifi, no eth, no modem, no bluetooth, no wireless devices.
If you even use just some of these you will increase your security.
Of course you also need to keep backups in multiple places and yes encrypted or at least split.

Depends on what do you mean. Bitcoin kind of already happened and either it goes to zero or it increases in value as humanity advances.

@_date: 2013-11-17 21:49:05
It's very simple.
The nonce is the number you change until the hash of the block matches difficulty and you win a block.
If you don't change anything (i.e. add/remove transactions) the hash will just be the same and you wouldn't be able to win a block (nobody would).
To avoid using the same number twice and thus wasting precious hashing power it's smart to increment the nonce by 1 for each hash (for the same set of transaction in a block at least) such that you only try each nonce at most once.
The way numbers are represented in computers could either be in one order or another (called endianess) which is to say how the data is stored (see 19843 vs 34891 for an equivalent decimal example) and it looks like Satoshi machine was increasing this nonce number on a machine having the opposite endianess than standard ibm clones (x86) vs say Sun Sparc or some fpga.
We could check this as the nonce is part of the block and therefore in the blockchain and people have analysed which block were found (presumably) by satoshi and found this interesting discrepancy.
The conspiracy goes that even back then he was using better hardware than anyone else.
Hope it helps :) 
btw, I also believe Satoshi is a group of people and not just one guy.

The only comment in there doesn't get that in order to do price discovery and until information is spread enough there will be volatility.
Once the information is spread enough and people are aware and price discovery is done it will be relatively stable and it grows there will be less and less need to "cash out".

Maybe, just maybe, the system is not fighting because this satoshi nakamoto guy is not a guy but a group of people which has ties with the financial system ?
It's a possibility, is it not ?
I do not see anyone fighting Bitcoin with any seriousness.
Yeah ok, some banks in UK and I hear Israel are not very keen on Bitcoin but the big picture guys is that mass media have been mostly covering Bitcoin in a positive light (the fact that it mentions it at all is quite telling) and Governments have mostly been talking about regulation and taxation, almost as if Bitcoin is business as usual.
I would say that if the world super power, which currently relies on dollars being necessary to buy oil, can coerce and convince almost all western countries to all secretly spy on citizens and erode civil rights then I don't think it would have a problem running after Bitcoin.
People say it's too little to be of any significance yet some even smaller entities such as Liberty Reserve have been attacked very promptly and so have been countries which tried to sell their oil in gold backed currencies or similarly against the dollar.
It's also entirely possible that simply the government doesn't understand bitcoin that well yet or that they do understand it and that in fact they welcome it (for whatever reason) even though it wasn't them creating it.
Or maybe they are fighting it hard and I just don't see it.
It sure is all very interesting.

May or may not be compromised but it sure as hell is targeted more than any other platform.

I remember 7% for USD

I would say avoid LTC until 10% of bitcoin accepting shops accept it.
BTC ? There's only 21 Million, 0.016 each vs 5000 $ each, there is time but don't do more than you can afford to lose, as always.

Well, that is illegal if they have proof it is a hacker C&amp;C server.
Otherwise it may be my small android app prototype and this guys are just blocking me.
Remember, you want to be sure before punishing at innocent man even if it means that some bad guys will get away from it.
To rephrase, you would not shut down a newspaper or a company because it has something that looks like illegal until you are sure it is illegal.
Yes ?

You only have to pay taxes on if if you paid less for your bitcoin than they're worth when you spend them, i.e. if you have gains.
Otherwise you already paid taxes on it.

Some people don't understand that some people have already cashed out, to XBT! :P

You know why is hot in inferno ??

About that, do you think his stash will ever be moved ?
Can you imagine in 10 years time, where you can buy everything for bitcoin and    the volatility is further reduced and suddenly those coins move ?
I'm not talking necessarily about much of it, even 0.05 coins moved from that address will generate tremendous interest!
I can't wait to know more.

Not sure, could be more than 60%, I need to check (can someone check!)

State doesn't allow what ? I'm already paid in a currency different from my state. 
I risk with the exchange rate every month and if one day this is not bearable I'll just have to find a better paying job or a local job.
