I am anticipating the usual CME dump at the end of the month unfortunately.

Is this iOS / Android only or is there a web wallet like GreenAddress use to have?

You must be the whale we have all been dreading . .

Fractional reserve incoming?
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:26:25
Good for them. I have seen a couple people posting on the past couple days who got jobbed.

I am pretty sure no lightning on android/iphone though so still very tough for on the go payments.
@_date: 2019-10-15 01:18:18
Any that you would recommend? Last I checked the one from Lightning Labs was still in Beta and I was hoping to try that out once it hit the app store.

What's the actual name? I could not find it in google play

The IB's, prop trading firms and the other Chad's team trading with them will be savagely trying to suppress the price this halvening. There will be a point where they will unable to keep suppressing the spot market and a breakout will occur. Just a mystery as to when that breakout will occur when they have no further BTC to dump on the spot market. The May halvening also corresponds to the usual strong buying that occurs around the conference in NY that happens every May so it will be interesting to see those 2 factors working together.

It doesn't verify gpg sigs and I am not putting anything of value in unverified software. I posted a thread like a month ago on the arch reddit about Bisq and they said it was totally open source. Hopefully it gets picked up soon, but I am not optimistic as trying to install electrum over the past week yields a bad signature. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:54:57
And they are still not batching which should be beyond east to implement. . .
@_date: 2019-02-28 00:50:43
It would be nice if ubuntu, fedora, or arch would put this in the official repos. Make it much easier to use and would be nice to have the automatic gpg verification of the software. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:35:15
Interesting. Are you thinking it is KYC related?
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:08:53
I am thinking it dumps today so Big Chad doesn't have to worry about his position over the holiday break.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:29:45
Coinbase is still not batching . . .
@_date: 2019-12-16 11:46:13
They support ipv6?

Man I miss this meme. Those were the good ol' days.
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:44:59
Do you get a bunch of dns leaks?

What was that one meme that was always posted from a Bollywood movie every time bitcoin was rallying? It had this big dance that was synchronized and was hilarious. 
I miss seeing it routinely on the front page.
@_date: 2019-04-07 23:05:57
..... And Coinbase is still not batching. They were responsible for like 50 percent of the mempool build up in December 2017. If they do not batch soon, it will likely lead to the same outcome of incredibly high fees.

It's a small price to pay for potentially having enough money to drink yourself into an early grave at 35.

I'm still waiting for somebody to remix 'I'm out here grinding' to 'I'm out here hodlin'. . .
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:28:10
Damn. . . thanks for the response. I didn't realize things were that dire. I originally bought from those swine when I first got into crypto 2 years ago. I recently bought from Abra ( probably not much better) and am hoping Arch puts Bisq in the official repositories soon so I can just run that. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:56:16
I still haven't seen the classic rally dance posted one time yet. It used to be posted like every day in late 2017.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:14:10
If you have arch/manjaro/antergos, electrum is in the repos by default.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:18:12
How does one go about gaining access to the bitcoin cash if they are currently holding bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:07:20
You got an example? If it is just a web address, wouldn't it be prone to dns/domain take downs and such?
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:18:43
It's a good way to put it. Unfortunately, I would not have it any other way. Hopefully we can shame those leeches into changing before the next run up. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 00:53:45
It's crazy how they claim they are pro crypto while still not engaging in something as simple as batching. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:51:21
Is Bisq entirely open source? If it is, it would be a crime for ubuntu or arch to not put it in the official repos for ease of access.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:06:34
How do you access these exchanges? Through a typical web address?
