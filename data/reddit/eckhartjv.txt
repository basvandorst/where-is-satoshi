yeh i saw. it's Nem.
I heard about NEM before. I guess that's the next coin to moon. After crypto gets more mainstream, ppl will go to Nem so they can buy McD with it.

Just skimming through this thread gave me a headache. Now I know why Satoshi created bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:56:53
so maybe that's why they were sold higher.
i heard rumors that whales avoid detection when accumulating by buying exchange accounts that amassed a coin they're interested in, rather than simply going in and placing in huge orders. And they pay over market value too, for that kind of service.
i'm not a whale, so i don't exactly see why they'd want to do that. I mean, if you buy it and the price goes up... then that's only good in the short-term, so they can even sell it to drive the price back down, then re-buy.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:14:07
Maybe I'm naive, but I didn't think the coinbase buys from like your account (and not from GDAX) affected the market. I thought they were just coinbase buys at market value that are between you and coinbase's BTC storage, you know?
It's like if you and a friend bought coins from one another. It's not like there were buy/sell orders that you were competing with...
So i figured buying directly from coinbase wouldn't really affect the market. 30,000 coins is a lot, yeah, but if this was 3 or 4 years ago, I saw on bitcointalk that people were moving 1,100 bitcoins around per day.

I'm actually interested in how you lost a lot of money being too paranoid about security lol :D.
I'm saying you can't lose your coins if they were stored with a private key created on a clean machine. But once you need to move those coins without going through the USB-OS startup, then you're always exposing your PC.
Actually even if you use a USB boot, there's still all this crazy shit you hear about USBs with firmware malware that can't be detected, and that specter and meltdown bug that lives in your RAM. I'm saying there's no way to be 100% sure the harware and software you're using is clean.

They're trying to use blockchain tech to create decentralized ID so there's no bias and people have more control over their identities. I think it's a good move, tbh.
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:08:07
A lot of people who are savvy in crypto posted on forums that they're selling everything when it was like 18 - 19k in December. They all said there was just manipulation and hyped up prices.
Vitalik, Charlie, and other crypto leaders said the same thing -- they were telling us we were approaching a bear market.
But we just laughed.
Whether they're right or wrong, the price did drop to $5.9k. Imagine if you sold at 19k and bought in at 5.9k?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:21:16
If banks are less regulated, they can pull off more manipulation... so sometimes regulations are good.

look at the bitcoin chart right now. See how close it is to forming the "batman" outline. That meme always comes up again and again. So chances are you're going to find it again today. :P Sell at the pointy ears, buy when you see the ears are touching the head :P 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:55:18
dude, how is that crypto's problem? So someone stole someone's credit card and used it to buy crypto... yet somehow they ban crypto because of it? They might as well ban buying anything that anyone's ever stolen a credit card with.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:20:29
Lol I never actually looked at it this way! I mean, i knew there was a limited supply of BTC, but I've been brainwashed to think it's a currency.
If everyone in China wanted 1 whole BTC, even if they had the money, they couldn't do it LOL.
MY GAWD! That means BTC could be like a collector's item, on top of its current value. :D
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:18:47
Nope. I wouldn't call it a bad decision, per se. A bad decision is when you lose money. Losing potential gains isn't really a bad decision, it's just missed opportunity.
But then again, if someone told me about bitcoin in 2009 and i decided not to buy it cuz i thought it was a scam... i'd say that was a bad decision now no matter what!
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:51:37

At first when i was reading this, i just shook my head at the fucked upness. Mass amounts of people just throwing away hashrate, electricity, bandwidth just to screw over other people? BTC is about mining together, not this kind of bs.
Then I read about how they can actually undermine crypto altogether by allowing double spending! WTF! If BTC is this fragile, then it's subtly scarier than one might think.
All it takes is one super billionaire creating a large mining farm for BTC and creating a huge pool that he turns on overnight. And on that night, he could seriously screw worldwide transactions. My gawd.

if you're not using a fancy wallet with fixed fees or an exchange to send/receive btc, then you can use the official wallet where you can choose not to include a fee and the transaction takes months but your BTC gets sent anyway.
I'm not sure if this is going to change in the future, tbh.

If Satoshi Nakamoto himself came out of hiding to sell all his BTC at once, I'm pretty sure against all logic, the price would go up instead of down. Just because of the sensationalism that he's alive and active again.
The promise of him contributing to crypto again is enough to cause some mega pumps. He's like the Jesus of crypto :P

It's not fiat, it's bitcoin. It's a digital currency. It can't completely be like fiat. It's electric, so it takes resources to send and receive, unlike giving someone a piece of paper and asking for it back.

I wish they would just ban cigarettes. I get that the country was founded on nicotine income and whatever.
It's just that, research literally shows that, almost 90 percent of lung cancer is directly caused by smoking. We're talking about natural and artificial lung cancer -- 87 percent of that is from cigarettes. How is that not bannable? The FDA bans pharmaceuticals that have caused bad side effects. Yet they can't ban cigarettes for some weird reason.
And people will argue that it's about freedom and free will. But then why is meth banned? Is it because it messes with your head? Cigarettes mess with your head too.
Someone should make a campaign with like a guy who walks up to a counter and points his finger at one of those fake bitcoin coins instead of pointing at the cigarette carton. Then there should be a huge caption that says, "In 10 years, his cigarette allowance turned into millions." Then they should another guy pointing at the cigarette carton, "In 10 years, his cigarette allowance still eats at his paycheck. It also gave him respiratory problems."
I would do it, but I don't have the photoshop skills. DANG this would make a great crypto ad.
@_date: 2018-02-08 07:42:18
It wasn't dumb when credit cards didn't consider crypto as cash advances.
I mean, it was legit a good idea. 1. Buy btc for $100 2. if price goes up, sell btc before your statement is due 3. pay your statement, keep profits. You didn't even have to use your own money XD
There's nothing dumb about it. If BTC went down, then all you had to do was pay the $100 that you would've paid upfront anyway if you were buying with cash/bank account?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:41:35
It's not really fraud if THE CREDIT CARD ITSELF doesn't allow the chargeback? Coinbase has proof that they sent the BTC to your account. Allowing the chargeback could be part of their agenda to FUD.

Man, tha'ts thinking short term?
In the long run, we all want BTC to, you know, be accepted and TRUSTED by the public? I'm not gonna lie, I too would've loved to have bought BTC at $5,900 :D but i was stuck in alts.
But i mean, no one is going to use bitcoin or any crypto if one week it's at $19,000 then the next week it's only $5,900. What are they, fools?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:54:22
OKay, fine i guess you're right. If you think about it, you can't really buy fiat with credit cards. I'm thinking Western Union and MoneyGram don't really allow you to buy their shit with your CC. But they do allow with debit cards. So I guess if crypto is to be taken seriously as a currency, this makes total sense.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:54:59
I don't blame him.
Crypto hype is huge. You have companies changing their names to add "Blockchain" in the front (like that ice cream company LOL) and suddenly their stock rises exponentially.

Every 10 years there's always something that goes viral. At least that's how it seems to be from like the 1990s to right now at the tail end of 1990s you had Google and the dotcom bubble. At the tail end of the 2000s, you had bitcoin. 
So I guess now is the time to start looking for the next big thing :P.

No, I Google'd, and saw NEM Nano wallet and just assumed it was a wallet by NEM. I mean, there are lots of decentralized wallets now, so I just figured it was that.
I don't use software wallets that aren't from the official coin for many reasons. So i'm not really in the loop with them, sorry.
I keep reading bad news about these multi-purpose wallets. I mean it starts with the billions of dollars of eth locked up happening MULTIPLE times. All because one person deleted one line of code.............
Then there's the XVG crisis with the third-party wallet there and how it instigated a class action lawsuit...
Crypto is literally all in or all out. There's not many safeguards. So I guess if people are going to go for third-party wallets, they should split the balance for everyday use versus banking.
Banking wallets should be the official coin's wallet that you don't touch. Everyday wallets for McD should be like $100 worth or something.
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:06:25

Amazon has this cashierless store called Amazon Go. There you buy groceries and stuff. It's totally automatic, so that's pretty ripe for crypto adoption.
I'd suspect that it's probably the first Amazon-related thing that gets crypto adoption because it has less of a chargeback issue. I mean, the goods are being sold by Amazon and not 3rd party sellers, so there isn't any chance someone runs away with your crypto. If the product is defective, the customers would just return it and amazon would return their crypto.
*sigh* but then there's the miner fee.

Okay, so let's say i'm a noob. How does one overthink security? Zero day attacks, etc. etc. How can you not be paranoid when you have literal money accessible on your hard drive.
Cold storage doesn't cut it. That means any time you want to move your coins, and if you're a crypto trader, you still have to access it. Then the best route there is having 2 wallets, one for a solid bank, and the other for everyday use. Still a pain.

@_date: 2018-03-09 18:39:08
This sounds horrible! But if i could be so kind as to give you a little bit of advice. Your modus operandi should be: 1. Make new private key, then 2. Generate address, and finally 3. Send new coins to new address.
You don't want to be sending coins to an address before getting the private key first.
IMHO the above steps would've prevented you from losing the 70k.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:21:03
Sometimes I'm one of those people.
All it takes is one typo when putting in an address, and you could lose everything. No do-overs. Nothing.
And sometimes I honestly feel like my coins are safer on an exchange because of 2fa. If your wallet is in your pc, it just takes one virus and that's it. On an exchange, even if someone figures out your pw, the 2fa saves you.
But yeah we all know how dangerous exchanges can be

I don't think professors should be credible just because they're professors... I could be a 2-time PhD in Economics and Third-World Financial Disputes... but if I don't even know how a blockchain works or proof of work... then I'm not qualified to make influential statements that will reach millions on the net and on newspapers?
But the prof does pose an interesting  question, if all the miners decide that it's not profitable to mine bitcoin (like if the price falls below $1000), then will bitcoin die? No transactions could be processed...
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:56:12
Oh, thanks you guys for clarification. I didn't know bitcoin mining difficulty could drop that low. I figured that so many bitcoins had been mined to a point that the difficulty should be at some minimum threshold now that there's some kind of bitcoin price threshold that cannot fall under because then it wouldn't be profitable.
But wow, so if bitcoin falls to $0.01, and so many miners stop mining, then the difficulty would fall so insanely low that there would be that one mining farm that didn't disassemble that could sweep up so many btc... with their hash...
